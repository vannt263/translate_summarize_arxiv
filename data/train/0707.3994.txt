    "phase transitions or sharp crossovers induced by continuous change in chemical composition have natural tendency to cause phase separation .",
    "phase separation occurs , when the free energy of the most stable homogeneous state has concave dependence on the concentration of particles ( i.e. this dependence is curved or peaked upward ) .",
    "the concave behavior is particularly likely in the course of a phase transition or a crossover , because the free energy switches between two different dependences characteristic of adjacent phases .",
    "the steeper is this switching , the likelier is the onset of concave behavior . in the case of electronic subsystems in solids ,",
    "a strong coulomb repulsion raises the threshold of phase separation and also , if the homogeneous electronic state becomes unstable , limits the size of single - phase regions to the nanometer scale along at least one of the spatial directions . in the present work , we introduce a quantitative measure of the above tendency towards phase separation in the vicinity of phase transitions and crossovers for the situations when the knowledge of various contributions to free energy is incomplete . we justify this measure in a very general context , and then use it to analyze the chances of electronic phase separation in high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "macroscopic phase separation in cuprates had been observed in lacuo@xmath0@xcite , where it occurs because of the high mobility of intercalated oxygen that maintains charge neutrality within each phase . in other cuprate families ,",
    "where dopant ions are immobile , the experimental situation is complicated by the possibility that phase separation may be limited by coulomb interaction to the difficult - to - access scale of a few nanometers , where inhomogeneities can also fluctuate in time .",
    "the direct experimental evidence for static nanoscale modulations has been reported so far only for a rather limited subset of cuprates@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the general tendency towards phase separation in cuprates and cuprate - related models is extensively discussed in the literature@xcite , but any conclusion about the actual presence or absence of phase separation suffers from uncertainties associated with the gross simplifications in the models .",
    "the important advantage of the phase separation measure introduced in this work is that it is directly applicable to real materials . at the same time",
    ", our analysis also provides a useful perspective to the results of various model studies .",
    "cuprates can exhibit phase separation for two related reasons : the onset of antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations and the onset of mott insulating gap . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the former and arrive at the conclusion that cuprates are very close to the phase separation threshold and can realistically phase separate .",
    "the the experimental results on the doping dependence of the overall intensity of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite and la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6@xcite constitute important input into our analysis .",
    "we also propose how the phenomenology of phase separation in lacuo@xmath0@xcite can be used to obtain information about the properties of `` generic '' cuprates .",
    "finally we point out that coulomb repulsion between charge carriers separated by the distances of 1 - 3 lattice periods _ strengthens _ the tendency towards phase separation by accelerating the decay of af correlations with doping .",
    "we analyze the dependence of free energy of energetically most stable homogeneous state as a function of charge carrier concentration .",
    "negative second derivative of this dependence ( equivalent to negative curvature or negative inverse compressibility ) will be considered as a sign of phase separation .",

    "the necessary condition for eq.([cond1 ] ) to correspond to a minimum rather than a maximum is to have a region of negative curvature somewhere between @xmath14 and @xmath16 .    if @xmath26 and its first derivative are continuous everywhere , then there exist three different regions of carrier concentrations :    \\1 ) miscibility gap @xmath28 , where the curvature is negative , and hence , the uniform composition locally unstable towards spinodal decomposition .",

    "[ this and other curvatures introduced below are implied to be @xmath8-dependent . ]",

    "once an excess charge carrier concentration @xmath38 starts building in some part of the sample , there is an additional energy cost @xmath39 associated with the coulomb repulsion of uncompensated charge , strain energy and gradient energy .",
    "when dopant atoms are immobile , we expect the main additional contribution to come from coulomb energy and denote the positive curvature associated with this contribution as @xmath40 the condition for the onset of phase separation then becomes : @xmath41 and the maxwell construction bounds on the miscibility gap and the metastable regions should also be modified accordingly .    in subsection  [ rigorous ]",
    "we quantify how large @xmath42 can be for the situations when only the values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are known , with or without additional knowledge of @xmath45 at @xmath12 and/or @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that the system phase separates is sometimes perceived as implying first order phase transition .",
    "however , in the case of volume constrained systems , e.g. electrons on the lattice , the relation between phase separation and the order of phase transition becomes less straightforward .",
    "in contrast to the more familiar constraint of constant pressure , which allows the phase coexistence only at a fixed temperature of a first order phase transition , the constraint of constant volume allows the coexistence of two phases in a range of temperatures@xcite .",
    "such a property , in turn , defeats the classification of the resulting behavior in terms of the jumps of thermodynamic derivatives , because , when the temperature of the system decreases past the phase separation threshold , the volume fraction of the second phase increases gradually , which normally implies no jump in entropy and no latent heat , but leads to a jump in the specific heat like in a second order phase transition . yet , at the phase separation temperature , the homogeneous state usually remains metastable , which means , that , in order to become phase separated , the system has to overcome a nucleation threshold .    in our classification , we distinguish between the types of  would - be \" homogeneous phase transitions , which are behind the onset of phase separation .",

    "many researchers expect that coulomb - frustrated in - plane phase separation can explain the formation of stripes , checkerboards or other nanoscale - limited inhomogeneous structures possibly existing in cuprates .    in the present work , however , we explore a different possibility , which we call the `` lasagna scenario '' . according to this scenario ,",
    "the three dimensional layered system phase separates into two - dimensional _ macroscopic _ regions of positive and negative charge lying on the top of each other in adjacent layers and having _ equal in absolute value _ and opposite in sign densities of uncompensated charge .",

    "we sidestep the discussion of multi - layered compounds and consider only single - layer cuprates .",
    "the lasagna scenario is worth exploring seriously , since it may well be realized in cuprates , and this would influence strongly the interpretation of many experiments . at the same time , this scenario is easier to treat theoretically , since one does not need to deal with the gradient terms and the strongly fluctuational nature of nanoscale inhomogeneities .",
    "the coulomb curvature ( [ kcoul ] ) for our scenario is comparable with and can easily be lower than that of nanoscale limited phase separation .",
    "absence of the nanoscale gradients is another energetic advantage of this scenario . where it may loose to the nanoscale - limited case is in the energy gained from phase separation . as follows from maxwell construction [ fig .",
    "[ fig - f](b ) ] , the charge densities of the oppositely charged regions in the phase separated state are , in general , not equal to each other . imposing the equal charge condition means that the energy gain due to phase separation is less than optimal .",
    "another extra cost of the present scenario is that of the suppressed interlayer hopping , which , however , should be small .",
    "if the lasagna scenario can be proven to be energetically advantageous over the homogeneous state , then it is guaranteed that the system is unstable towards phase separation  either according to the lasagna scenario , or with in - plane nanoscale inhomogeneities , if they lower the energy even further or better accessible kinetically .",

    "however , for a finite cooling rate , the onset of phase separation may happen at lower temperatures , because it requires activation over an energy barrier between metastable homogeneous state and phase - separated state .",
    "one can only be certain , that , even if the cooling rate is too fast ( but the oxygen ions remain mobile ) , phase separation should start once the charge carrier concentration reaches the right spinodal boundary , which we associated with the critical concentration @xmath136 . in other words : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the right boundary of the phase separation range observable experimentally _ at temperatures , where intercalated oxygen ions are still mobile_. the loss of oxygen mobility manifests itself in the freezing of the experimentally observable boundaries of the phase separation region , i.e. these boundaries in the axes of fig .",

    "one can then see that in fig .",
    "[ fig - lco ] there are only two useful experimental points for the right end of the phase separation region  those through which the straight line is drawn .",

    "this , however , only strengthens the case for inequality ( [ xc013 ] ) .    to summarize this subsection ,",
    "we have discussed the direct observational constraint@xcite @xmath148 and an indirect experimental evidence ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lco ] ) for @xmath149 . in terms of subsection  [ combine ]",
    ", @xmath150 implies that the chances of phase separation are significant but less than 50 per cent , while @xmath149 indicates that phase separation is likely , i.e. its chances are significantly above 50 per cent .",
    "the studies of the @xmath151 and hubbard models for the values of parameters relevant to the cuprates@xcite agree that these models are close to the threshold of phase separation but do not reach the consensus on whether phase separation actually takes place or not .",
    "however , the common expectation is that even if the @xmath151 or hubbard model solutions are slightly over the phase separation threshold , the in - plane coulomb repulsion between charge carriers ( not included in the models but present in real materials ) would easily suppress phase separation .",
    "ivanov@xcite has reported numerical results directly supporting this expectation .",
    "the above expectation appears to be in conflict with the conclusion of the preceeding subsection derived from the analysis of experiments .",
    "below we further suggest that this expectation can be misleading on purely theoretical grounds .",
    "we argue that the omission of the  medium - range \" coulomb repulsion between the charge carriers separated by 1 - 3 lattice periods leads to a larger value of the critical concentration @xmath44 , where af correlations vanish .",
    "this , in turn , weakens the tendency towards phase separation .",
    "we introduce the effect of the medium - range coulomb interactions on the doping dependence of af correlations in several steps as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] .",
    "we start from the half - filled state , where the exchange energy per spin is about @xmath152 , and then estimate @xmath44 as the concentration of holes necessary to destroy this energy .",
    "although @xmath11 includes indirect effects of af correlations in addition to just af exchange energy , this function should become zero , when af correlations disappear , which , in turn , happens simultaneously with af exchange energy falling to zero .",
    "( 100 , 65 ) ( 5 , 0 ) = 3 in    first we consider the approximation of `` independent charge carriers '' [ line ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] ] , according to which , each hole independently destroys af correlations in the region around itself .",
    "the af energy cost of a doped hole can be estimated@xcite using the typical length of two lattice periods for the string of broken af bonds , which are left behind by the hole added to the half - filled t - j model with @xmath153 .",
    "this means that 1 hole creates approximately 7 ferromagnetic bonds at energy cost @xmath152 each , i.e. it destroys af energy about @xmath154 .",
    "this simple estimate should be reasonable for a broader class of situations beyond the string picture in @xmath151 model .    in the above approximation",
    ", the af energy disappears at the doping concentration determined by condition : @xmath155 which means @xmath115 .",
    "the above estimate of the af exchange energy per hole should hold for very small doping concentrations . as step 2 of our analysis",
    ", we take into account the fact that , at larger concentrations , the holes would tend to hop onto the sites with af bonds broken by a nearby hole .",
    "the af exchange energy cost per hole is , therefore , reduced as the hole concentration increases , following line ( b ) sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] .",
    "this sketch presumably reflects what happens in the t - j and hubbard models and explains why @xmath44 associated with those models can easily increase to the values 0.4 - 0.5 , which , in turn , makes the onset of phase separation uncertain .    at the next step ,",
    "we introduce the medium - range coulomb repulsion between charge carriers .",
    "this repulsion prevents one hole from taking advantage of the af bonds broken by another hole .",
    "therefore , each hole again destroys more af bonds .",
    "it is this factor , that may have been missing in the numerical work of ivanov@xcite , who found that the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion suppressed phase separation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , a variational ansatz was used , which did not suppress the chances of holes to occupy adjacent lattice sites , and , therefore , not surprisingly , the resulting energy balance opposed phase separation .    one can estimate the coulomb interaction constants between holes occupying adjacent lattice sites as 700  mev .",
    "this estimate uses the high frequency dielectric constant @xmath156 .",
    "the high frequency value is taken , because the lifetime of the region of broken af bonds can be estimated as @xmath157 , which is faster than the timescale of lattice vibrations responsible for low frequency coulomb screening .",
    "( we assume the debye frequency @xmath158  mev@xmath159 . )",
    "one should also consider the possibility of holes forming long - living pairs or larger clusters . in this case",
    ", lattice would have time to respond , which means that it would additionally screen the interaction between holes , and thereby reduce the dielectric constant to @xmath160@xcite .",
    "however , even in the latter case , the repulsion between holes occupying nearest neighbor sites remains significant  about 100  mev .",
    "once the medium - range coulomb repulsion is taken into consideration , the plot of exchange energy as a function of doping concentration should pass somewhere between lines ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] , which gives line ( c ) . at lower concentrations",
    ", it is closer to the independent hole approximation , i.e. line ( a ) , and at higher concentrations , when charge carriers have no choice but to approach each other , the plot should be closer to line ( b ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the medium range coulomb repulsion is to make the af crossover sharper , i.e. the af negative curvature in the crossover region around @xmath161 should become larger .",
    "the next level of approximation is to introduce the coulomb potential of dopant ions  line ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] . at low doping concentrations ,",
    "this potential should localize holes around dopant ions and thereby reduce the radius of the region around the hole , where af correlations are destroyed .",
    "therefore , the low doping part of the af energy vs. doping concentration plot should have smaller slope than the one in the preceeding step . as the doping concentration increases ,",
    "the coulomb potential wells around the dopant ions start overlapping stronger , and therefore , the result of the previous step is recovered . as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - theor ] such a correction further increases the af negative curvature in the region around @xmath161 .",
    "quantitatively , however , this correction depends on the localization radius around dopant ions and may be minor , if this radius is larger than two lattice periods .",
    "the latter appears to be the case for the cuprates@xcite .",
    "finally , the coulomb interaction would also play an important role in the energy balance determining what kind of inhomogeneous patterns emerge if the homogeneous state becomes unstable , but this is the subject beyond the scope of the present work . as mentioned in subsection",
    "[ coulomb ] , the above instability can lead , among others , to stripes@xcite , checkerboards(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , or the charge imbalance between adjacent cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "we have demonstrated that focusing on the question of how the energy associated with magnetic or other type of correlations evolves with doping , leads to a useful insight into the factors controlling phase separation in the vicinity of phase transitions and crossovers .",
    "we have introduced a quantitative constraint on the negative curvature contribution to the free energy and used this constraint to evaluate the chances of electronic phase separation in the cuprates .",
    "our analysis of the antiferromagnetic crossover in the cuprates has led us to conclude that these materials are realistically close to the phase separation threshold , and the chances that they generically exhibit some form of phase separation within the superconducting doping range are quantitatively significant .",
    "in particular , the lasagna phase separation scenario with macroscopic regions of opposite charge lying on the top of each other in adjacent cuo@xmath1 planes appears to be quite viable and creates additional worry for the interpretation of many experiments .",
    "cuprates also appear to be closer to the phase separation threshold than the expectations based on the hubbard and @xmath151 models suggest .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the above models neglect coulomb interaction between charge carriers separated by 1 - 3 lattice sites .",
    "the proximity to the phase separation threshold on either side , rather than the presence or the absence of phase separation as such , may be the distinguishing characteristics of the superconducting cuprates . the resulting  softness \" of the electronic liquid",
    "should then lead to significant fluctuations of charge density and electric field at long wavelengths and relatively low frequencies@xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation through dmr-0404781 .",
    "at a first order phase transition , the system switches from one minimum of free energy to another , not continuously connected to the first one in the space of macroscopic variables of the system .",
    "the values of free energy of the minima should have different dependencies on the carrier concentration .",
    "the switching between the two minima takes place at the critical carrier concentration , where the two free energies coincide ( see fig .  [ fig - cusp ] ) . as obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - cusp ] , this guarantees that the resulting concentration dependence of the minimal free energy has an upward cusp at @xmath59 .",
    "the upward cusp implies infinite negative second derivative at @xmath59 , which , in turn , guarantees that the system phase separates around @xmath44 [ at least on nanoscale ] , no matter what the value of coulomb interaction is .",
    "since the observation of phase separation does not immediately imply that the underlying homogeneous transition would be of the first order , one can make a compelling case in favor of such a transition , only when none of the two phases can emerge from the other as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking : e.g. , for antiferromagnetic ",
    "ferromagnetic transition in the context of colossal magnetoresistance manganites , and for the low temperature orthorhombic  low temperature tetragonal ( lto  ltt ) transition in cuprates and nickelates .",
    "however , even in the above two examples , the homogeneous transition can be split into two closely spaced second order transitions resulting in a `` rounded '' cusp in the concentration dependence of free energy .",
    "we start from the standard landau expansion for a second order phase transition in terms of an order parameter having absolute value @xmath162 ( e.g. the absolute value of staggered magnetization ) .",
    "the transformational properties of this order parameter under time reversal are such that , in the absence of external field , only even powers of @xmath162 enter the expansion for the free energy , i.e. @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are two expansion coefficients .",
    "the onset of the phase transition is determined by the sign of coefficient @xmath164 , which can be parameterized as @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is a positive constant , @xmath168 is temperature , and @xmath169 is the transition temperature . at @xmath170 ,",
    "@xmath164 is negative and hence the minimum of free energy is reached at @xmath171 .",
    "the minimized free energy is then @xmath172    now we consider the evolution of parameters in eq.([fmin ] ) as a function of carrier concentration as relevant to the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tcx ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath173 may depend on the concentration @xmath8 , but near ( below ) the critical doping concentration @xmath44 , the key factor is the dependence of @xmath169 on @xmath8 , which we parameterize in the vicinity of @xmath44 as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a slope parameter .",
    "any alternative parameterization of the form with @xmath176 or @xmath177 would be more favorable to phase separation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - alt ] and the related discussion in subsection  [ rigorous ] ) . substituting eq.([tc ] ) into eq.([fmin ] ) , we obtain @xmath178 ^ 2 , \\label{fetax}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 the _ negative _ curvature given by @xmath179 and @xmath180 important for the analysis of cuprates is the property that , if the negative curvature ( [ keta ] ) outweighs the positive curvature of the rest of the free energy , then one of the ends of the miscibility gap would coincide with @xmath136 .    the value of @xmath42 given by eq.([keta ] ) can now be estimated as follows :    the slope of the @xmath169-vs.-@xmath8 line around @xmath12 can be crudely approximated as @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the critical temperature at @xmath47 .",
    "the value of @xmath183 can be estimated by equating the landau expansion result and the approximate microscopic value of the gain in the ordering energy @xmath11 at @xmath47 , @xmath184 : @xmath185 the value of @xmath71 is assumed to be known either from experiments or from direct microscopic considerations .",
    "thus @xmath186    despite the crudeness of the assumptions that led to eq.([curv ] ) , the right - hand - side of this equation is , in fact , a rigorous constraint on the negative curvature for a broad class of situations .",
    "it is formulated in subsection  [ rigorous ] and derived in appendix  [ constraints ] .",
    "crossovers constitute , perhaps , the most general case , where neither of the derivatives @xmath11 exhibits a jump ( see fig .  [ fig - cross ] ) .",
    "for the purposes of this work , phase transitions of orders higher than two can also be treated as crossovers . like second order phase transitions",
    "the crossovers must lead to the regions of the negative curvature of @xmath11 .",
    "one can make a good estimate of this curvature by approximating the crossover behavior of @xmath11 by a suitable second order phase transition curve .",
