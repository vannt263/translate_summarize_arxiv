    "we give an fpt - algorithm for the maximum stable set problem restricted to bull - free graphs .",
    "this generalizes the result of dabrowski , lozin , mller and rautenbach  @xcite who give an fpt - algorithm for the same parameterized problem for \\{bull , @xmath16}-free graphs , where @xmath17 is a path on 5 vertices and @xmath16 is its complement . in a weighted graph",
    "the _ weight _ of a set is the sum of the weights of its elements , and with @xmath18 we denote the weight of a maximum weighted independent set of a graph @xmath2 with weight function @xmath19 .",
    "we state below the problem that we solve more formally .",
    "parameterized weighted independent set + _ instance : _ a weighted graph @xmath2 with weight function @xmath20 and a positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "+ _ parameter : _ @xmath0 + _ problem : _ decide whether @xmath2 has an independent set of weight at least @xmath0 .",
    "if no such set exists , find an independent set of weight @xmath21 .",
    "observe that the problem above is hard for general graphs .",
    "furthermore , it is @xmath22$]-hard  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : polyoracle ]",
    ", we show that while a polynomial kernel is unlikely to exist since the problem is or - compositional , we can prove nonetheless that the hardness of the problem can be reduced to polynomial size instances .",
    "precisely we show that if it takes time @xmath14 to decide if a stable set of size @xmath0 exists for bull - free graphs of size @xmath1 , then one can solve the problem on instances of size @xmath12 in time @xmath11 for some polynomial @xmath15 in @xmath12 .",
    "the fact that hard cases can be reduced to size polynomial in @xmath0 is not captured by the existence of a polynomial kernel , but by what is called a turing - kernel ( see section  [ sec : polyoracle ] or lokshtanov  @xcite for a definition of turing - kernels ) .",
    "even the existence of a poly(@xmath12 ) set of kernels of size poly(@xmath0 ) seems unclear for this problem . to our knowledge , stability in bull - free graphs",
    "is the first example of a problem admitting a polynomial turing - kernel which is not known to have an independent set of polynomial kernels .",
    "further examples are given in jansen  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is to investigate which classical problems without polynomial kernels do have a polynomial turing - kernel .",
    "this question is investigated by hermelin et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all this work has been very recently improved by perret du cray and sau  @xcite . using the same method as ours , but with a better implementation for detecting the decomposition and a more precise description of the basic classes , they reach a running time of @xmath23 , and they could get the size of the turing kernel down to @xmath24 .    at the end of the paper , we use the machinery developped in the previous sections to bound the chromatic number of bull - free graphs .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the chromatic number of @xmath2 and @xmath26 denote the maximum size of a _ clique _ of a graph @xmath2 , that is a set of pairwise adjacent vertices of @xmath2 .",
    "an obvious reason for a graph to have a high chromatic number is the presence of large cliques .",
    "but as shown by many well - known constructions , this is not the only source : there exist graphs with fixed maximum clique size , namely  2 , and arbitrarily large chromatic number .",
    "therefore , a second reason for a graph to have a large chromatic number can be the presence of triangle - free induced subgraphs with large chromatic number .",
    "we therefore define the _ triangle - free chromatic number _ of a graph @xmath2 as the maximum chromatic number of a triangle - free induced subgraph of @xmath2 , and we denote it by @xmath27 . we wonder whether the only possible reason why a graph @xmath2 may have a large chromatic number is that @xmath27 is large or @xmath26 is large . this has been asked several times by researchers , but we could not find a reference .",
    "it can be stated formally as follows .",
    "[ q : fb ] does there exits a function @xmath13 such that for every graph @xmath2",

    ", we prove the existence of @xmath13 for bull - free graphs .",
    "the existence of @xmath13 in general would maybe not be so surprising , since with respect to the chromatic number , triangle - free graph are perhaps as complex as general graphs . nevertheless , it would have non - trivial implications , in particular it would settle the famous conjecture below on odd - hole - free graph .",
    "a class of graphs is _ hereditary _ if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs .",

    "the class of odd - hole - free graph is @xmath10-bounded .",
    "a `` yes '' answer to question  [ q : fb ] would settle the conjecture above because , @xmath29 is at most 2 in graphs with no odd holes .",
    "indeed , an odd - hole - free graph with no triangle is bipartite .",
    "our results imply that gyrfs s conjecture on odd holes is true for bull - free graphs .",
    "to conclude , it seems to us that the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for the maximum stable set problem for a class of graphs is such a strong property that it raises the next question .",
    "is it true that if a polynomial time algorithm exists for the maximum stable set problem in a hereditary class of graph , then this class is @xmath10-bounded ?    if p = np , then the above question is clearly answered by `` no '' ( since the class of all graphs is not @xmath10-bounded ) ; but under the assumption that p@xmath31np , it might be answered by `` yes '' .",
    "note that to our knowledge , all hereditary classes with a polynomial time algorithm for @xmath9 are @xmath10-bounded , and in some situations , the algorithm for @xmath9 is quite involved ( for instance in perfect graphs  @xcite , claw - free graphs  @xcite , or in @xmath17-free graphs as announced recently by lokshtanov , vatshelle and villanger  @xcite ) .    a shorter version of the present work appeared in @xcite .",
    "in the series of papers @xcite chudnovsky gives a complete structural characterisation of bull - free graphs which we first describe informally .",

    "class @xmath34 consists of graphs whose size is bounded by some constant , the graphs in @xmath35 are built from a triangle - free graph @xmath3 and a collection of disjoint cliques with prescribed attachments in @xmath3 ( so triangle - free graphs are in this class , and also ordered split graphs ) , and @xmath33 generalizes graphs @xmath2 that have a pair @xmath36 of vertices , so that @xmath36 is dominating both in @xmath2 and @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , each graph @xmath2 in @xmath38 comes with a list @xmath39 of `` expandable edges '' .",
    "chudnovsky shows that every bull - free graph that is not obtained by substitution ( a composition operation that is a reversal of homogeneous set decomposition ) from smaller ones , can be constructed from a basic bull - free graph by expanding the edges in @xmath39 ( where edge expansion is an operation corresponding to reversing the homogeneous pair decomposition ) .",
    "all these terms will be defined later in this section . to prove and use this result ,",
    "it is convenient to work on trigraphs ( a generalization of graphs where some edges are left `` undecided '' ) , and the first step is to obtain a decomposition theorem for bull - free trigraphs using homogeneous sets and homogeneous pairs . in this paper",

    "<S> if we forbid odd holes in addition to the bull , we show the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for the stable set problem . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that the chromatic number of a bull - free graph is bounded by a function of its clique number and the maximum chromatic number of its triangle - free induced subgraphs . </S>",
    "<S> all our results rely on a decomposition theorem for bull - free graphs due to chudnovsky which is modified here , allowing us to provide extreme decompositions , adapted to our computational purpose . </S>"
