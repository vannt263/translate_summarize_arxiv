    "in classical and quantum gravity , the most important elements are invariants under the general coordinate transformation ( referred to as general invariants ) because they are independent of a chosen coordinate .",
    "physical quantities can be expressed as functions of them .",
    "the main problem we address in this paper is how to find all independent general invariants for each space - dimension .",
    "it is highly non - trivial because of the high symmetry of riemann tensors and their products.@xcite as far as general invariants with lower mass - dimensions@xcite are concerned , it is practically no problem because we have much experience in the past .",
    "however we encounter general invariants with higher mass - dimensions in some cases such as when we consider gravitational theories in the higher space - dimensions ( ex . weyl anomaly in a higher dimensional gravity - matter theory ) or when we consider higher - order quantum corrections there ( ex . counter - terms at higher - order or higher - order effective action ) . as the mass - dimension of general invariants increases , the above problem becomes serious . at present",
    ", there seems to be no general way of fixing complete and independent general invariants .",
    "with such a direction in mind , an approach to treat general invariants is given in @xcite , where a graphical representation is introduced .",
    "the problem of listing all general invariants is transformed to that of listing all closed graphs .",
    "it works for a general geometry in general space - dimension .",
    "some graph relations are introduced to express some relations between riemann tensors such as bianchi identity and the cyclic identity .",
    "it is a powerful technique to find relations between general invariants .",
    "however , as noted in the discussion of @xcite , the approach does not guarantee the independence between finally listed ones .",
    "it gives only the sufficient terms as the list of complete and independent general invariants .",
    "the final list of terms could still involves linearly dependent terms . in this paper , we provide another approach to prove the independence of general invariants , as local functions , in the final list .",
    "as far as local properties are concerned , it is sufficient to consider them in the weak - field perturbation around flat space . @xmath2 where @xmath3  and @xmath4 is the flat space metric .",
    "the advantages of this `` weak - field''(or `` linear '' ) representation , compared with the use of the full metric @xmath5 and its inverse @xmath6 , are a ) there are no inverse fields and every general invariant is expressed by @xmath7 and its derivatives , and b ) if we express general tensors in terms of `` weak - fields '' representation , some non - linear relations@xcite , such as the bianchi identity and the cyclic identity , are automatically satisfied at each order of @xmath8 . each general invariant is expanded as an infinite power series in @xmath7 . among many expanded terms , we focus mainly on the products of @xmath9 , because they turn out to give sufficient information to determine important quantities . as for general terms",
    ", we will make comments in sec.vi and sec.x . in @xcite ( we call this paper ( i) ) , we introduced a graphical representation for the products of @xmath9 , and examined some basic definitions and lemmas , some features of the graphs . paper ( i )",
    "deals mainly with the case of @xmath10- and @xmath11-tensors . in this paper",
    "we study @xmath12-tensors , where we can see a more general structure valid for general invariants with higher mass - dimensions .",
    "we classify @xmath12-invariants completely .",
    "the result is applied to the proof of independence of general invariants with dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we prove it for a general geometry in a general space - dimension .",
    "after listing all independent general invariants in a general dimension , we examine them in each space - dimension in order to find additional relations depending on the space - dimension .",
    "the approach of @xcite is applied and 2 , 4 and 6 space - dimensions are considered .",
    "many graphs are presented to show their usefulness .",
    "we can easily identify a tensor or an invariant with many suffixes involved .",
    "one of its important advantages is we can utilize the graph topology in explicit tensor calculation ( in computer ) .",
    "we introduce some _ indices _ to represent the graph topology .",
    "the explicit calculational result of weak field expansion of general invariants , presented in app.e , shows the power of the present approach .    in sec.ii , we review paper ( i ) and explain the basic ingredients necessary for the present classification .",
    "every so(n)-invariant is represented by a graph .",
    "classification is done in a two - fold way : one by the bondless diagram , which is explained in sec.iii , and the other by reduced graphs , which is explained in sec.iv .",
    "every graph is named respecting both classification schemes . in sec.v",
    ", we introduce some indices in order to specify every graph by a set of topological numbers .",
    "the set of indices distinguishes each graph .",
    "every graph has another number called the weight , which shows the `` degree of symmetry '' with respect to suffix - contraction .",
    "various identities between weights are presented in sec.vi .",

    "disconnected graphs are treated in sec.vii .",
    "we devote ourselves to the classification of so(n)-invariants from sec.ii to sec.vii . in sec.viii",
    "we apply the results to general relativity and show the independence of general invariants .",
    "all special relations , between general invariants , which depend on space - dimension are explicitly obtained for 2 , 4 and 6 dimensions in sec.ix .",
