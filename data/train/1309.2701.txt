    "the study of processor shared queues has received much attention over the past 45 or so years .",
    "the processor sharing ( ps ) discipline has the advantage over , say , first - in first - out ( fifo ) , in that shorter jobs tend to get through the system more rapidly .",
    "ps models were introduced during the 1960 s by kleinrock ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "there has been renewed attention paid to such models , due to their applicability to the flow - level performance of bandwidth - sharing protocols in packet - switched communication networks ( see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of such a model is the @xmath1-ps queue . here",
    "customers arrive according to a poisson process with rate parameter @xmath2 , the server works at rate @xmath3 , there is no queue , and if there are @xmath4 customers in the system each gets an equal fraction @xmath5 of the server .",
    "ps and fifo models differ significantly if we consider the `` sojourn time '' .",
    "this is defined as the time it takes for a given customer , called a `` tagged customer '' , to get through the system ( after having obtained the required amount of service ) .",
    "the sojourn time is a random variable that we denote by @xmath6 . for the simplest @xmath1 model ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath6 depends on the total service time @xmath7 that the customer requests and also on the number of other customers present when the tagged customer enters the system .",
    "one natural variant of the @xmath1-ps model is the finite population model , which puts an upper bound on the number of customers that can be served by the processor .",
    "the model assumes that there are a total of @xmath8 customers , and each customer will enter service in the next @xmath9 time units with probability @xmath10 . at any time there are @xmath11 customers being served and the remaining @xmath12 customers are in the general population .",
    "hence the total arrival rate is @xmath13 $ ] and we may view the model as a ps queue with a state - dependent arrival rate that decreases linearly to zero . once a customer finishes service that customer re - enters the general population .",
    "the service times are exponentially distributed with mean @xmath14 and we define the traffic intensity @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "this model may describe , for example , a network of @xmath8 terminals in series with a processor - shared cpu .",
    "this may be viewed as a closed two node queueing network .",
    "the finite population model does not seem amenable to an exact solution .",
    "however , various asymptotic studies have been done in the limit @xmath17 , so that the total population , or the number of terminals , is large .",
    "if @xmath8 is large it is reasonable to assume either that @xmath18 , the arrival rate of each individual customer , is small , of the order @xmath19 , or that the service rate @xmath3 is large , of the order @xmath20",
    ". then @xmath16 will remain @xmath21 as @xmath17 .",
    "previous studies of the finite population model were carried out by morrison and mitra ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , in each case for @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the moments of the sojourn time @xmath6 conditioned on the service time @xmath7 are obtained in @xcite , where it was found that the asymptotics are very different according as @xmath22 ( called `` normal usage '' ) , @xmath23 ( called `` heavy usage '' ) , or @xmath24 ( called `` very heavy usage '' ) . in @xcite the unconditional sojourn time distribution is investigated for @xmath17 and the three cases of @xmath15 , in @xcite the author obtains asymptotic results for the conditional sojourn time distribution , conditioned on the service time @xmath7 , in the very heavy usage case @xmath24 , and in @xcite the results of @xcite are generalized to multiple customer classes ( here the population @xmath8 is divided into several classes , with each class having different arrival and service times ) . in @xcite the authors analyze the multiple class model and obtain the unconditional sojourn time moments for @xmath17 in the normal usage case , while in @xcite heavy usage results are obtained .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectral structure of the finite population model as @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the sojourn time by @xmath25 and its conditional density we call @xmath26 with @xmath27.\\ ] ] here @xmath28 denotes the number of other customers present in the system immediately before the tagged customer arrives , and thus @xmath29 .",
    "then we define the column vector @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 satisfies a system of odes in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an @xmath34 tridiagonal matrix , whose entries depend on @xmath16 and @xmath8 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are all negative and we denote them by @xmath35 @xmath36 with the corresponding eigenvectors being @xmath37",
    ". we shall study this eigenvalue problem for @xmath17 and three cases of @xmath15 : @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath38 . in each case",
    "we obtain expansions of the @xmath39 and then the @xmath40 , for various ranges of @xmath41 .",
    "often the eigenvectors can be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials for @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath33 is a finite matrix the spectrum is purely discrete , but as the size of the matrix becomes large we sometimes see the eigenvalues coalescing about a certain value . ordering the eigenvalues as @xmath42 , the tail behavior of @xmath26 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 is determined by the smallest eigenvalue @xmath45 , where @xmath43 is the unconditional sojourn time density with @xmath46.\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that while previous studies ( see @xcite-@xcite ) of the finite population model lead to the scaling @xmath23 , the spectrum involves the transition scale @xmath38 .",
    "our basic approach is to use singular perturbation methods to analyze the system of odes when @xmath8 becomes large .",
    "the problem can then be reduced to solving simpler , single differential equations whose solutions are known , such as hermite equations .",
    "our analysis does make some assumptions about the forms of various asymptotic series , and about the asymptotic matching of expansions on different scales .",
    "we also comment that we assume that the eigenvalue index @xmath47 is @xmath21 ; thus we are not computing the large eigenvalues here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we state the mathematical problem and obtain the basic equations . in section 3",
    "we summarize our final asymptotic results for the eigenvalues and the ( unnormalized ) eigenvectors .",
    "the derivations are relegated to section 4 .",
    "some numerical studies appear in section 5 ; these assess the accuracy of the asymptotics .",
    "throughout the paper we assume that time has been scaled so to make the mean service time @xmath48 .",

    "our analysis will assume that @xmath0 but for sufficiently large @xmath68 ( [ s2_fs_sim ] ) must still hold .",

    "we shall show that the behavior of the eigenvalues is very different for the cases @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath70 ( more precisely @xmath38 ) .",
    "furthermore , within each range of @xmath15 the form of the expansions of the eigenfunctions @xmath40 is different in several ranges of @xmath41 .",
    "our analysis will cover each of these ranges , but we restrict ourselves to the eigenvalue index @xmath47 being @xmath21 .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath33 has @xmath71 eigenvalues so that @xmath47 could be scaled as large as @xmath20 .",
    "we are thus calculating ( asymptotically for @xmath17 ) only the first few eigenvalues and their eigenfunctions .",
    "obtaining , say , the large eigenvalues , would likely need a very different asymptotic analysis . when @xmath72 we shall see that the eigenfunctions and their zeros are concentrated in a narrow range of @xmath73 , which represents the fraction of the customer population that is using the processor .",
    "since @xmath40 are functions of the discrete variable @xmath41 , by `` zeros '' we refer to sign changes of the eigenvectors . if the eigenvalue index @xmath47 were scaled to be also large with @xmath8 , we would expect that these sign changes would be more frequent , and would occur throughout the entire interval @xmath74 .",
    "we comment that to understand fully the asymptotic structure of @xmath75 for @xmath17 requires a much more complete analysis than simply knowing the eigenvalues / eigenfunctions , as the spectral expansion may not be useful in certain space / time ranges .",

    "we compute @xmath43 exactly ( numerically ) , using ( [ s2_fs_sum ] ) and ( [ s2_fs_probn ] ) in ( [ s1_pt ] ) , and compare the result to the approximation in ( [ s2_fs_ptsim ] ) , which uses only the zeroth eigenvalue @xmath45 . tables  [ table3]-[table5 ] compare the exact @xmath467 $ ] to the corresponding approximation from ( [ s2_fs_ptsim ] ) , and we note that both must approach @xmath45 as @xmath44 .",
