    "downward air - showers have been studied in last century leading to new advances in cosmic rays spectra and compositions as well as to highest energy particle physics .",
    "cosmic rays studies clarified fundamental physics as the matter and anti - matter ( electron - positron ) or the pion - muon interaction nature opening the gate toward present quark and lepton understanding of elementary particles .",
    "air showers are commonly downward chain reactions originated by incoming cosmic rays ( nucleons , nuclei , gamma ) on upper earth atmosphere .",
    "earth itself absorbs most upcoming cosmic rays , suppressing also pevs upward muons secondaries produced by noisy atmospheric @xmath7 , @xmath8 neutrinos .",
    "downward air - showers , hadronic or electro - magnetic , have been widely modeled and measured . at first sight",
    "up - ward air - showers are totally forbidden by the severe opacity of the earth below both to muons as well as ( by terrestrial growing shadowing ) also to @xmath2 neutrinos , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 at tens tevs energies and above .",
    "the surviving upward @xmath12 muons , founded in amanda , baikal , macro detectors are _ not _ usually , able to lead to any upward air showers .",
    "moreover uhe @xmath13 , @xmath14 will produce very confined shower ( the lpm , landau , pomeranchuk , migdal effect ) within a very thin earth layer ( less than few meters ) immediately buried in there ; upward uhe @xmath15 , atmospheric or astrophysical @xmath7 , @xmath11 and their muons produced on a thin earth crust ( few kms depth ) will freely escape from the earth with very rare catastrophic bremsstrahlung showering in the atmosphere .",
    "uhe @xmath0 , @xmath16 have been usually neglected due to the tau short life - time .",
    "moreover one should remind that uhe @xmath0 , @xmath1 are rarely ( @xmath17 ) produced in high energy astrophysical sources .",
    "however the recent discover by super kamiokande of a full flavor mixing @xmath7 @xmath0 implies a nearly homogeneous abundance of all uhe @xmath13 , @xmath7,@xmath0 flavors ( fargion 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the upward uhe @xmath0 , being less opaque to the earth , it may interact within the terrestrial surface crust ( nearly kms depth ) leading to @xmath18 events in tau air - shower uptaus form ( fargion 2000 ) .",
    "correlation between uptaus and observed terrestrial gamma flashes ( tgf ) has been noted ( fargion 2000,2001 , he2.5 ) .",
    "here we present and discriminate the three main new kind of air - showers to be detectable on balloons or satellites .. ( 1 ) upward @xmath3 air - shower uptaus around pevs energies .",

    "the nature of uptaus and hortaus are analogous , but at different energy windows : @xmath20- @xmath20ev , @xmath21 ev respectively .",
    "their bang in matter and bang in air remind the _ tau double bang _",
    "( learned , pakvasa 1995 ) .",
    "they are different respect downward air - showers .",
    "indeed the @xmath3 decay is bounded to a limited size and has an hybrid electro - magnetic and hadronic interaction with matter .",
    "the @xmath3 main air - shower channels must reflect the rich and structured behaviours of @xmath3 decay modes .",
    "let us label the main uhe decay channels ( hadronic or electro - magnetic ) and the consequent air - shower imprint , with corresponding probability ratio in following table .         as a function of uhe neutrino energy in earth with overlapping the resonant @xmath22 , interactions ( gandhi et all 1998)and @xmath3 ranges ( fargion icrc 1999,2001 ) .",
    "@xmath23 shows the interaction length due to new physics for rock @xmath24,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .",
    "[ fig : boxed_graphic 5 ]    the uptau cascade occur at high quota where atmosphere is less dense and imply longer final shower tails . for this reasons",
    "the scale time of the @xmath5 are longer ( hundreds microseconds ) and harder than downward ones .",
    "the uptaus maybe therefore bent in a thin - twin fan arcs few degree size by earth magnetic field leading to a twin shower beams in deflected ( positive - negative ) thin elliptical cones .",
    "the deflection has a strong azimuth and zenith imprint as well as a characteristic geological signature ( by earth density ) .",
    "it is negligible observing to north and south , while it is maximal observing east and west .",
    "deflection and opening angles are maximal in asia where terrestrial magnetism is largest as indeed observed in tgfs data ( fargion 2000 ) .",
    "if the twin - beam uptaus is observed by a wide spaced array in space its spatial and temporal ( fargion 2000,2001 ) arrival structure should be observed .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1@xmath3 hortaus , may be generated efficiently also in front of a mountain chains : their detection on ground or from the mountain arrays has been discussed ( fargion et all icrc 26,1999 ; fargion icrc 27,he 2001 ) .",
    "the expression that describe the probability to observe a uptaus and hortaus shower by an uhe @xmath0 , @xmath1 is suppressed by earth opacity and it is proportional to the probability to make a @xmath3 within the earth ( or mountain ) crust : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the angle below the horizons while standing on the earth ( see fargion 2001 ) . from height",
    "@xmath27 ( for instance the satellite orbit),the same expression becomes : @xmath28 @xmath29}}{{r_{\\nu_{\\tau}}(e_{\\nu})}}}(1 - e^{- \\frac{r_{\\tau}(e_{\\tau})}{r_{\\nu_{\\tau}}(e_{\\nu } ) } } ) .\\ ] ] where @xmath26 from height @xmath30 reaches a minimal values when it is just tangent to the earth : then @xmath31 is : @xmath32 this angle from satellites at height @xmath30 @xmath33 is 22.4 degrees below the horizons .     originated by uhe @xmath0 ( white track ) crossing the earth and interacting within the thin earth crust layer . the uhe @xmath3 track ( red line ) at pevs decay in air leading to a complex shower : a twin - split green and violet short spirals stand respectively for positron and electron fan - shaped components ; longer twin - split blue - orange tracks describe the positive - negative muons .",
    "final surviving bremsstrahlung gamma , x and cherenkov photons are flashing in a twin wide , but thin , yellow fan - shaped beams to satellite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the visible earth surface from a satellite , like batse , at height @xmath34 km and the consequent effective volume for uhe @xmath35 pevs interaction and @xmath3 air shower beamed within @xmath36 is : ( note @xmath37 because 70 % of the earth is covered by seas ) the effective volume and the event rate should be reduced , at large nadir angle ( @xmath38 ) by the atmosphere depth and opacity ( for a given @xmath39 energy ) .",
    "therefore the observable volume may be reduced approximately to within @xmath40 values and the expected uhe pev event rate is ( fargion 2000 ) @xmath41 it is well possible that uptaus have been already observed ( fargion 2000,2001 ) as upward terrestrial gamma flashes .",
    "present and future satellite as glast should be able to confirm the uptaus discover .",
    "earth atmosphere is continuously reflecting a noisy cosmic ray albedo due mainly to neutral pion decays in gamma upward ; these pions are secondaries of common incoming cosmic rays hitting the earth atmosphere .",
    "their low energy statistical overlapping is not source of any sudden showers .",
    "however the detection of uptaus and in particular of hortaus from satellite is disturbed by a different upcoming competitive shower signal : the hias , the high altitude , nearly tangential , uhe cosmic ray , showers . indeed",
    "the atmosphere depth at slant depth greater than @xmath42 @xmath43 is commonly opaque ( suppression @xmath44 ) to most cosmic rays showers ( but not to muons ones ) .",
    "then uhecr can not send signals upward while crossing all the earth dense atmosphere . on the contrary at very high altitude air become so diluted that it may become again transparent to horizontal uhecr . at more high quota",
    "the paucity of air makes rare the uhecr interactions and there are not showers again .",
    "there is an optimal height which permits to tangential uhecr to lead to powerful showers .",
    "the determination of this height is not obvious .",
    "the author is not aware of any derivation of this height value .",
    "here we derive a new general expression .",
    "the geometry of the problem needs a simple diagram",
    ".     made by uhe @xmath0 at @xmath21 ev energies ( white track ) crossing the earth crust at depth @xmath45 ( few km ) and interacting with tens or a hundred terrestrial km layers .",
    "the same upcoming hortaus hits the observer ( mountains , balloons , satellite ) at height @xmath30 .",
    "hias produce at a characteristic quota @xmath46 a long track shower within a thin corona height @xmath47 , ( defined by density decay law ) , reaching the observer ( balloons , satellite ) at quota @xmath30.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .",
    "their hadronic or electro - magnetic interaction defines the altitudes where the shower is originated and propagate .",
    "the terrestrial magnetic field leads to electron pairs and muon pairs splitting and a very wide twin gamma beam in a fan shape , upward and downward.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the properties of hortaus are comparable to uptaus but they are bounded in a thin terrestrial layer and at a higher ( eev ) energy band .",
    "the height @xmath47 is the characteristic exponential air density height , @xmath46 is the last transparent air quota where high altitude air - shower take place , @xmath30 is the satellite or balloon quota , @xmath45 is the deepest distance from the earth surface for horizontal hortaus .",
    "we first estimate the atmosphere depth crossed horizontally : @xmath48 we then infer that this slant depth is comparable to common vertical one .",
    "this request defines and fix the fine tuned height @xmath46 value . because for satellites the distances are large we may approximate above integral in : @xmath49 @xmath50 the consequent trascendental equation that fix the height @xmath46 is @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath47= @xmath53 km , @xmath54 is the earth radius , a is an additional parameter of order of unity that calibrate the shower slant depth to its incoming energy as well as to its hadronic or electro - magnetic interaction nature .",
    "after simple substitution and applying known empirical laws for the logarithmic growth of the x slant depth one derives respectively for hadronic and gamma uhecr showers : @xmath55\\ ] ] @xmath56\\ ] ] the corresponding solution for the trascendental equations above are : @xmath57 \\ ; $ km$\\ ] ] @xmath58 \\ ; $ km$\\ ] ] the characteristic distances crossed from this altitudes to the satellites are hundred of kilometers .",
    "therefore there is an important role of the magnetic fields in bending the hias trajectories in a fan - shaped arc .",
    "this allow to observe a hias not only at its origination direction ( nearly one degree above the earth edge , from a satellite ) but also below the earth horizons .",
    "obviously the down - ward component of the hias may reach back the earth but with a negligible strength .",
    "therefore , for the same reason , there are not hias appearing above ( one degree ) from the earth horizons observing on satellites . on the contrary hias",
    "may hit high quota baloons ( @xmath59 ) quota both mainly above the terrestrial horizons and rarely nearly horizontally and more rarely below the horizons .",
    "therefore baloons ( possibly in arrays ) are ideal detectors for hias .",
    "the upcoming hias are also important because they may be confused as a hortaus from satellites , but not in mountain observatories . the trajectory and the morphology of the two events maybe discriminate .",
    "hias while being able to appear below the horizons from satellite , can not completely mimic uptaus because their track , spectra , timing are quite different .",
    "the possibility to uhecr neutrino to slip tangent to earth crust at optimal neutrino interaction length and longest tau range makes them ideal signals as hortaus .",
    "their maximal probability occurs as shown in fig2 , at the crossing of tau - neutrino lengths near @xmath60 = @xmath4 , near gzk cut off bounds(fargion , mele , salis 1999 ) where neutrino interaction lengths is comparable to the tau one . at the same energy range one may find the characteristic height , or negative depth , @xmath45 few km , where the hortaus should begin to make a uhe tau ; consequently tau shower should deploy neither at too low atmosphere ( being absorbed ) , nor at too high atmosphere ( where no shower may be amplified ) .",
    "hortaus may also turn upward by geo - magnetic fields .",
    "in particular from a mountain hortaus within@xmath61 may appear at angles below the original ones leading to more frequent ( apparent ) uptaus events ; their timing and spectra and morphology is different from direct pevs uptaus . the height where tau decay which define also the optimal tau energy equation for hortaus is analogous , but more complex than the hias one .     originated by an ultra high energy neutrino at @xmath4 energies ( white track ) crossing the earth and interacting within earth crust layer .",
    "the uhe tau track ( red line ) decay in air leading to a longer complex shower comparable to the described ones above , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the trascendental equation that defines the tau distance @xmath62 analogous to the hias one are : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 or @xmath67 are the same defined in eq.@xmath68 .",
    "the solution of this equation leads to a characteristic uhe @xmath69 = @xmath70 decay distance at height @xmath71 km where the hortaus begins to shower .",
    "this imply a possibility to discover efficiently by satellite and ballons arrays uhe @xmath0 , @xmath1 up to @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "other consequences of the hortaus , uptaus and hias physics will be shown soon elsewhere .",
    "arrays in valleys , mountains , airlines , ballons and satellites should easily discover their traces ."
