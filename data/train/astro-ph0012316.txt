    "envelopes of neutron stars ( nss ) are divided in the inner and outer envelopes .",
    "properties of the inner envelopes are outlined in a companion paper @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the outer ones , at typical densities @xmath6 and temperatures @xmath7  k. these envelopes are relatively thin , but they affect significantly ns evolution . in particular , they provide thermal insulation of stellar interiors .",
    "bulk properties of the ns envelopes ( pressure @xmath8 , internal energy @xmath9 ) are determined mainly by degenerate electron gas .",
    "the electrons are relativistic at @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the fermi wave number , @xmath13 is the electron mass , @xmath14 is the electron number density , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ion charge and mass numbers , respectively .",
    "degeneracy is strong at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the ionic component of the plasma can form either strongly coupled coulomb liquid or solid , classical or quantum .",
    "the classical ion coupling parameter is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ion - sphere radius ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the ions form a crystal if @xmath24 exceeds some critical value @xmath25 ( see below ) .",
    "the quantization of ionic motion becomes important at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ion plasma temperature , and @xmath28 is the ion mass .",
    "the ionic contribution determines specific heat @xmath29 , unless @xmath26 .",
    "the ions and electrons are coupled together through the electron response ( screening ) .",
    "the inverse screening ( thomas  fermi ) length is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron chemical potential . if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fine structure constant .",
    "note that @xmath36 at @xmath37 ; therefore the screening effects do not vanish even at high densities .",
    "thermodynamic properties are altered by the magnetic field @xmath38 in the case where the landau quantization of transverse electron motion is important .",
    "the field is called _ strongly quantizing _ when it sets all electrons on the ground landau level .",
    "this occurs at @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath41 and @xmath42  g. _ weakly quantizing _ fields ( @xmath43 ) do not significantly alter @xmath8 and @xmath9 but cause oscillations of @xmath29 , other second - order quantities , and electron transport coefficients with increasing density .",
    "characteristic domains in the @xmath44@xmath45 diagram are shown in figure  [ fig - domains ] .",
    "the short - dashed lines on the left panel indicate the region of partial ionization .",
    "the dot - dashed lines correspond to @xmath46 ( upper lines ) and @xmath47 ( liquid / solid phase transition ) .",
    "long - dashed lines on the right panel separate three @xmath44@xmath45 regions where the magnetic field is strongly quantizing ( to the left of @xmath48 and considerably below @xmath49 ) , weakly quantizing ( to the right of @xmath48 at @xmath50 ) , or classical ( much above @xmath49 ) .",
    "10.2 cm    the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - domains ] show profiles @xmath51 in the envelope of a `` canonical '' ns with mass @xmath52 and radius 10 km , and with an effective surface temperature @xmath53  k or @xmath54  k ( the values of @xmath55 are marked near these curves ) .",
    "typical temperatures of isolated nss are believed to lie in the hatched region between these two lines . in a magnetized ns ,",
    "@xmath51 depends on strength as well as direction of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore on the right panel we show _ two _ dotted curves for each value of @xmath56 : the lower curve of each pair corresponds to the heat propagation along the field lines ( @xmath57 , ",
    "i.e. , near the magnetic poles ) and the upper one to the transverse propagation ( @xmath58 , near the magnetic equator ) .",
    "thermodynamic functions of the electron gas at arbitrary degeneracy are expressed through the well known fermi - dirac integrals . for astrophysical use ,",
    "it is convenient to employ analytic fitting formulae for these functions presented , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nonideal ( exchange and correlation ) corrections for nonrelativistic electrons at finite temperature have been calculated and parameterized in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the relativistic electrons at low @xmath45 ,",
    "an analytic expansion of the exchange corrections is given , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in this case , the correlation corrections are negligible )",
    ". a smooth interpolation between these two cases has been constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the ionic component at @xmath59 , the main contribution to the thermodynamic functions comes from the ion correlations .",
    "strongly coupled one - component coulomb plasmas ( ocp ) of ions in the _ uniform _ electron background have been studied by many authors .",
    "the thermodynamic functions of the classical ocp liquid have been calculated @xcite at @xmath60 and parameterized @xcite for @xmath61 .",
    "the latter parameterization ensures accuracy @xmath62 ( per particle ) .    for the classical coulomb crystal , accurate numerical results and fitting formulae to the free energy @xmath63 ( with anharmonic corrections taken into account )",
    "have been presented in refs .",
    "a comparison of the latter results with the fit @xcite for the liquid yields the liquid  solid phase transition at @xmath64 ( curiously , this value could be derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the solid phase",
    ", quantum effects may be important at the considered temperatures .",
    "these effects can be most easily taken into account in the approximation of a harmonic coulomb crystal .",
    "a convenient analytic approximation is provided by a model @xcite which treats two phonon modes as debye modes and the third one as an einstein mode .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite of the harmonic - lattice contributions to @xmath63 , @xmath9 , @xmath29 , and the mean - square ion displacement are reproduced by this model at arbitrary @xmath65 within several percent , which is sufficient for many applications .",
    "8 cm    finally , there is a contribution from ion - electron ( @xmath66 ) correlations , which can be treated as polarization of the  jellium \" of the degenerate electrons . in a coulomb liquid , this contribution has been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite using a perturbation theory which involves the electron dielectric function and the static structure factor of ions .",
    "this approximation is justified at @xmath67 ( which is the case at @xmath68 ) . at smaller densities",
    "the @xmath66 contribution in the coulomb liquid has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the hnc technique ( heavy dots in fig .",
    "[ fig - ie ] ) .    in a coulomb",
    "solid , the @xmath66 contribution has been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the perturbation theory @xcite and a model lattice structure factor . these results , though approximate ,",
    "indicate that the polarization corrections may be rather important .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 may be shifted by @xmath69% when the @xmath66 corrections in the liquid and solid phases are taken into account .",
    "the numerical results have been fitted @xcite by analytic functions of @xmath70 and @xmath24 .",
    "the approximation @xcite for the ocp liquid is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ie ] by solid lines .",
    "since the @xmath66 correction is not dominant , the accuracy of the fitting formulae ( @xmath71% ) is sufficient for most of astrophysical applications .",
    "an alternative pad approximation , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the electron - ion fluid , is also accurate at @xmath72 for small and large @xmath24 , but it is less accurate at intermediate @xmath24 and inapplicable at @xmath73 ( dashed lines ) .    as mentioned above , quantizing magnetic fields significantly affect the equation of state . in the fully ionized dense plasma ,",
    "the main effects are described by the model of ideal electron gas , studied by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "heat conduction in ns envelopes is provided mainly by the electrons .",
    "the thermal conductivity tensor @xmath74 is determined mainly by the electron - ion scattering .",
    "calculation of @xmath74 should take into account specific features of the coulomb plasmas in ns envelopes , quite different from the terrestrial liquid and solid metals : ( i ) in the liquid phase , an incipient long - range order emerges at @xmath75 ; ( ii ) in the solid phase , there are usually many brillouin zones within the fermi surface ; ( iii ) in the solid phase , the approximation of one - phonon scattering fails near the melting , which necessitates the use of a more general expression for the structure factor of ions .",
    "these features have been taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , where analytic approximations to the electron transport coefficients have also been derived .",
    "magnetic field hampers electron transport across the field lines : transverse thermal and electrical conductivities are reduced by orders of magnitude in typical ns envelopes .",
    "strongly quantizing field significantly changes also longitudinal conductivities ; weakly quantizing field causes de haas  van alphen oscillations .",
    "these effects have been outlined , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "a unified treatment of the electron transport coefficients in the domains of classical , weakly quantizing , and strongly quantizing magnetic field has been developed in @xcite .",
    "a fortran code which implements this treatment is available at ` http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/astro/conduct/ ` . using this code and solving the thermal diffusion equation ,",
