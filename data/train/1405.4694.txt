    "could also account for the features of diffuse magnetic scattering intensity .",
    "to conclude , through polarized neutron scattering experiments and polarization analysis , we observe predominant short - range order in feal@xmath0o@xmath1 , which extend up to third nearest - neighbour shells in spinel unit cell .",

    "clear indication of long - range antiferromagnetic order at 4  k is obtained in the case of mnal@xmath0o@xmath1 . however , significant short - range order coexist with long - range magnetic order in this compound even at @xmath14 40  k. a comparison of the magnetic behaviour of mnal@xmath0o@xmath1 ( mn@xmath3 ; @xmath36 = @xmath37 ) , feal@xmath0o@xmath1 ( fe@xmath3 ; @xmath36 = 2 ) and coal@xmath0o@xmath1 ( co@xmath3 ; @xmath36 = @xmath38 ) suggests a transition from magnetically long - range order to short - range order as the @xmath36 value is reduced .",
    "this provides a hint for investigating @xmath36 = 1 and @xmath22 spinels in search of quantum effects in spin liquid states . through our re - investigation",
    ", we have convincingly shown that : ( i ) feal@xmath0o@xmath1 displays no long - range magnetic order down to 4  k ( ii ) the true ground state of minimally disordered feal@xmath0o@xmath1 is not a canonical spin - glass ( iii ) in mnal@xmath0o@xmath1 , long- and short - range spin correlations coexist . remarkably , by considering quantum fluctuations as the predominant mechanism that relieves spin frustration , a phase diagram comprising of six coplanar spiral ordering in addition to nel phase was suggested.@xcite a strong connection between frustration and strength of quantum fluctuations was suggested .",
