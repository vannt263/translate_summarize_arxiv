    "stripe formation occurs in a wide variety of soft @xcite and hard @xcite condensed matter systems .",
    "these stripe patterns are often a consequence of some form of effective competing or multiple length scales in the pairwise interactions between the particles @xcite . for soft condensed matter",
    ", pattern formation can occur when the particles experience intermediate range repulsion and short range attraction , such as in certain types of colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to stripe phases , numerous other patterns can appear as a function of density , temperature , or particle interaction strength , including bubble , clump , and uniform crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "the competing interactions that produce the stripes may be produced by particles that have both a short range attraction and a long range repulsion @xcite ; however , systems with only repulsive interactions can also exhibit stripe phases @xcite provided that there are at least two length scales in the interaction potential .",
    "typically , as the density increases , the system progresses from a low density clump phase to an intermediate density stripe phase , and then to a higher density bubble phase where organized voids appear in the system ; finally , at the highest densities , the particles form a uniform crystal state @xcite . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems of finite size , a stripe phase containing oriented stripes is often observed @xcite ; however , for larger systems , the strong degeneracy in the stripe ground state orientation can produce a labyrinth pattern composed of many different stripe orientations @xcite . the presence of any type of bias produced by the boundaries , a substrate , or an external drive such as a shear breaks the symmetry of the stripe ground state and causes the stripes to align in a single direction @xcite .",
    "in addition to soft matter systems , there is growing evidence that stripe and bubble phases occur in hard condensed matter systems such as 2d electrons in the quantum hall regime @xcite and charge ordering in high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "evidence for stripe phases in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems includes anisotropic transport curves which have been interpreted as indicating that the stripes have a single preferred orientation @xcite .",
    "if the stripes take the form of a charge ordered state , the transport anisotropy implies that the stripes can slide more easily when the drive is applied parallel to the stripes than when it is applied perpendicular to them .",
    "the alignment of the stripes in the 2deg systems may be due to small intrinsic biases that form during sample growth @xcite .",
    "there have also been recent 2deg experiments that show that dc drives or other external driving can dynamically orient the stripes under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "other recent experiments have shown that the stripe direction can be controlled with a strain , making it possible to alter the anisotropy with a strain field @xcite .",
    "transport experiments in 2degs have revealed sharp conduction thresholds , a series of intricate jumps in the current versus resistance curves , pronounced hysteresis , and changes in the conduction noise , suggesting that these systems are undergoing depinning transitions and dynamic changes in the sliding dynamics @xcite .",
    "additional evidence for charge ordered states in 2degs has come from resonance measurements @xcite .",
    "another recently described system where stripe patterns occur is in `` type-1.5 '' superconductors , predicted to appear in two - band superconductors such as mgb@xmath0 @xcite . in a type - ii superconductor under a magnetic field , the flux in the sample takes the form of quantized vortices which organize into a uniform triangular lattice as a result of their repulsive interactions .",
    "in contrast , in type-1.5 superconductors , the vortices have both an attractive and a repulsive component to their interactions @xcite , which in principle will lead to the formation of clumps and stripes .",
    "experiments in the two - band superconductor systems have revealed evidence for disordered clump - like vortex structures ; however , strong pinning in the samples probably prevents the detection of ordered patterned structures @xcite .    in the 2d electron systems and the type-1.5 superconductors , the interplay between the disorder in the sample and an external drive should produce very rich dynamics with different types of depinning transitions and sliding states",
    "it should also be possible to subject stripe - forming soft matter systems to both an external drive and quenched disorder .",
    "experiments have already been conducted on the depinning of purely repulsive colloids interacting with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "similar experiments could be performed with colloidal systems that have interactions which lead to stripe formation .",
    "the work we describe here is also relevant to systems exhibiting anisotropic sliding friction due to the formation of stripe - like surface ordering @xcite . to address how stripe - forming systems behave in the presence of both driving and quenched disorder ,",
    "we simulate a collection of particles driven over randomly placed attractive pinning sites and interacting with a long range repulsion and a short range attraction @xcite .",
    "we show that when the stripes have a specific orientation , a number of distinct sliding states can occur which have distinct anisotropic transport signatures , including a peak in the anisotropy produced when the dynamics is plastic for driving transverse to the stripes but elastic for driving along the stripes .    in our previous work",
    ", we have examined the depinning and sliding of disordered bubble , clump , and stripe phases , and found that for a fixed pinning density , the stripe phase has the highest depinning threshold @xcite . in this case",
    ", the stripes did not have a single orientation but instead formed a disordered labyrinth pattern .",
    "when plastic depinning occurred , it was possible to induce a dynamical reordering transition into a stripe state aligned with the driving direction @xcite .",
    "we also found that the dynamically induced reorientation strongly depends on the strength of the quenched disorder . only for sufficiently strong quenched disorder",
    "are there enough plastic distortions to permit the formation of the oriented stripes @xcite . when the pinning is weak , the labyrinth structures depin elastically without any distortions and the aligned stripes never form .    here",
    "we analyze the transition from elastic to plastic depinning and show that for some parameters , the stripe system exhibits a peak effect phenomenon similar to that observed at the transition from elastic to plastic depinning in vortex matter .",
    "the vortex peak effect is associated with a sharp increase in the depinning force as well as changes in the transport curves @xcite .",
    "we show that the peak effect in the stripe system can occur for driving in either direction and that it is possible to have a peak effect for one direction of drive but not the other . in previous work",
    ", we showed that there is a broad maximum in the depinning force for the stripe phase as function of the strength of the attractive term . in this work",
    ", we study the peak effect in the stripe phase as a function of disorder and temperature , and find that it occurs as a sharp , first - order - like transition which is similar to the peak effect observed in superconductors .    in this work we explicitly focus on the case where the stripes are already in an aligned state rather than in a disordered labyrinth phase .",
    "this permits us to apply a drive in two well - defined directions , along and perpendicular to the stripes , and to compare the anisotropic response for different strengths of quenched disorder .",
    "as noted previously , many of the 2deg stripe systems appear to contain oriented stripes . to our knowledge",
    "the depinning and sliding dynamics of an oriented stripe system has not previously been numerically studied .",
    "we find several new types of sliding phases that do not appear for sliding dynamics in isotropic systems such as vortices @xcite , colloids @xcite , sliding charge density waves @xcite , or sliding wigner crystals @xcite .",
    "for example , we find several different types of plastic stripe flow . in one state ,",
    "individual structures slide past stationary stripes ; in another state , the stripe structure remains intact but a portion of the particles within the stripes are pinned while other particles flow past in one - dimensional ( 1d ) channels . for strong disorder",
    "the stripe structure breaks apart and the flow is similar to the plastic flow observed in isotropic vortex systems @xcite .",
    "we also find that the extent to which the stripes reorient is strongly sweep rate dependent .",
    "this affects measurements of the depinning thresholds and features in the transport curves .",

    "the transient time passes through peaks at the transitions between different dynamical states , such as from pinned to filamentary flow or from strongly fluctuating plastic flow to ordered flow .",
    "in addition to the stripe system , this type of transient measurement after a sudden application of a drive could also be used in other driven systems such as superconducting vortices with quenched disorder , friction , and sliding charge density waves .",
    "we observe different types of plastic flow which are determined by the direction of the drive relative to the stripe orientation . for driving parallel to the stripes",
    ", there is a phase in which the stripes remain ordered but are decoupled and can slide past one another . for stronger",
    "quenched disorder , plastic flow can occur within individual stripes while the overall stripe structure remains intact . in this case , the flow is filamentary and involves only a portion of the particles within the stripe . for stronger or denser quenched disorder , the stripes break apart and we find a strongly fluctuating plastic flow phase in which the transport properties are isotropic .",
    "for driving perpendicular to the stripe orientation , in addition to plastic flow phases there can be elastic depinning of the stripes perpendicular to the drive for sufficiently weak disorder .    as a function of disorder strength",
    "we find a sharp order to disorder transition in which the state above depinning changes from an ordered moving stripe structure to a plastic flow regime which tears apart the stripes .",
    "this order - disorder transition is accompanied by a sharp increase in the depinning threshold which is similar to the peak effect phenomenon observed near order - disorder transitions for vortex matter in type - ii superconductors . in the stripe system the order - disorder transition occurs at different disorder strengths for the two different driving directions , producing regimes of enhanced anisotropy in which the system depins plastically in one direction but elastically in the other .    in the plastic flow regime near depinning , we observe a series of velocity jumps and transitions which correspond to transitions between filamentary flow states associated with narrow band time - of - flight velocity noise signatures and strongly fluctuating plastic flow states exhibiting broad band noise signatures .",
    "these transitions are very similar to recent experimental observations in this class of system .",
    "the anisotropic transport can be enhanced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "thermal disorder induces an anisotropic melting of the stripes , with a lower temperature stripe liquid in which particles can move easily along the length of the stripe but remain confined perpendicular to the stripe , and a higher temperature isotropic liquid in which the stripe structure is destroyed . for intermediate quenched disorder strength ,",
    "the stripe structure is disordered at low temperatures but can undergo a thermally induced stripe ordering into a floating stripe phase when the thermal fluctuations reduce the effectiveness of the quenched disorder .",
    "we expect that these results should be generic to any type of stripe forming system driven over quenched disorder .",
    "particular systems where the pulse measurements and transient times could be analyzed include two - dimensional electron gasses or the recently studied type-1.5 superconductors in which the vortices interact via competing repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "other relevant systems include stripe or labyrinth patterns in soft matter systems driven with electric or magnetic fields over a rough surface or through obstacle arrays .",
