    "<S> we present temperature dependent switching measurements of the co / ni multilayered free element of 75  nm diameter spin - valve nanopillars . </S>",
    "<S> angular dependent hysteresis measurements as well as switching field measurements taken at low temperature are in agreement with a model of thermal activation over a perpendicular anisotropy barrier </S>",
    "<S> . however , the statistics of switching ( mean switching field and switching variance ) from 20  k up to 400  k are in disagreement with a nel - brown model that assumes a temperature independent barrier height and anisotropy field . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a modified nel - brown model that s fit the experimental data in which we take a @xmath0 dependence to the barrier height and the anisotropy field due to the temperature dependent magnetization and anisotropy energy .    in nanometer scale magnetic elements , </S>",
    "<S> the nel - brown model is widely invoked due to its reducing the dynamics of a large assembly of spins to the behavior of a single , collective spin orientation in a uniaxial potential energy landscape @xcite . from this model </S>",
    "<S> there have emerged important predictions for thermally assisted reversal under applied magnetic fields and spin - torques @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent spin - torque and thermally assisted switching studies in perpendicularly magnetized nanopillar spin - valves have tested this macrospin model at room temperature . experimentally obtained energy barrier heights were shown to be much lower than the uniaxial barrier height determined by the entire macrospin volume @xcite . nevertheless , the switching distributions appear well described by overcoming a single energy barrier , whose height is related to an excited magnetic subvolume in the free layer element @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this description is in good agreement with spin - torque switching results on 100  nm lateral size nanopillar devices and the underlying behavior has been observed in micromagnetic simulations as well as dynamic imaging measurements @xcite .    in order to test the validity of this uniaxial model , temperature dependent measurements of the switching statistics </S>",
    "<S> can be used to probe the barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> we present dynamical measurements of the switching field in co / ni nanopillars as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> while our switching field measurements taken at constant temperature are consistent with a single energy barrier model , the temperature dependence of the mean switching field and switching distribution width suggest that the barrier is not independent of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this can be reconciled with experimental data by taking account of the temperature dependence of the magnetization and the perpendicular anisotropy previously noted in co / ni multilayered films , which modify the barrier height and coercivity . by introducing a @xmath0 dependence to the barrier height and coercivity to the nel - brown model </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the validity of this model for thermally activated reversal over a wide temperature range ( 50  k - 400  k ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the co / ni nanopillars studied here are part of an all perpendicular spin - valve device . </S>",
    "<S> details on materials and sample preparation have been reported previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic multilayered structure consists of a pt(3 nm)/[co(0.25 nm)/pt(0.52 nm)]x5/co(0.2 nm)/[ni(0.6 nm)/ </S>",
    "<S> co(0.1 nm)]x2/co(0.1 nm ) hard reference layer and a co(0.1 nm)/[co(0.1 nm)/ni(0.6 nm)]x4/pt(3 nm ) free layer separated by a 4 nm cu spacer layer patterned into 75  nm diameter nanopillars . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were taken in a closed - cycle cryostat between the poles of an electromagnet oriented perpendicular to the device plane and at temperatures ranging from 20  k - 400  k. the reference layer magnetization switches for an applied field close to 1 t. since no fields greater than 0.5 t are applied during the measurements , the reference layer is expected to remain stable . for all the experiments shown here the reference layer magnetization points along the direction of positive magnetic fields .    the magnetization of the free layer is probed indirectly with four - probe measurements of the differential resistance of the spin - valve device under an @xmath1 excitation current using standard lock - in techniques . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : hysteresis ] shows typical resistance versus applied perpendicular field hysteresis loops at room temperature and at 20  k. the sharp changes in resistance @xmath2 referenced to the low resistance parallel alignment indicates switching of the free layer into a parallel or antiparallel configuration with the reference layer . </S>",
    "<S> the approximately 80  mt shift of the center of the hysteresis loops reflects the inhomogeneous dipolar field from the reference layer averaged over the free layer . </S>",
    "<S> this spatially inhomogeneous field can lead to asymmetric reversal behavior for @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions @xcite . in the following results </S>",
    "<S> , we will simply present the total effective field @xmath5 , as the applied field minus the dipolar loop shift .    in order to probe the switching behavior </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the angular dependence of reversal . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : sw plot ] illustrates the switching fields measured at 20  k. these were determined from differential resistance versus field minor loops taken under different rotation angles of the spin - valve pillar with respect to the fixed poles of our electromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the switching fields form an astroid that is clearly symmetric , but exhibits much larger hard - axis switching fields than predicted by the stoner - wohlfarth model . however , with the addition of a second - order uniaxial anisotropy contribution to the energy density we demonstrate a qualitatively better fit to our angular dependent data . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy energy density for our free layer element is therefore : @xmath6 from the best - fit curve to our data , we obtain @xmath7 and @xmath8 , assuming that @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of second - order anisotropies in co / ni multilayered films has been previously investigated using ferromagnetic resonance methods and their presence in spin - valve devices has been predicted as the source of symmetry breaking in the current - field state diagram @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a strong indication of the significance of the high uniaxial barrier to reversal and the extracted anisotropy field @xmath10 will be used subsequently in expressions for the energy barrier .    </S>",
    "<S> thermally - assisted escape of a nanomagnet s magnetization from a metastable state can be described by an arrhenius law in the following formalism : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 is in the range of 1 - 10  ghz and @xmath15 is a field - dependent energy barrier . from this escape rate </S>",
    "<S> , we have the survival probability of a metastable state after time @xmath16 : @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the above expression assumes a model system described by a single field - dependent energy barrier , for which we use the following expression:@xmath18 the expression describes the energy barrier in terms of a barrier height , @xmath19 , the zero - temperature anisotropy field , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , an exponent that rapidly decreases from 2 to 1.5 under a small misalignment between the external magnetic field and the easy axis of the ferromagnet ; we will take 1.5 as the value for @xmath21 @xcite .    to test the single barrier model , </S>",
    "<S> we have conducted switching field measurements as a function of temperature . switching field measurements </S>",
    "<S> constitute applying a linear magnetic field sweep and recording the field at which the magnet reverses , which for our spin - valve pillars is defined by a step change in device resistance as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hysteresis ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thermal activation predicts a characteristic distribution of switching fields sensitive to the sweeping rate and the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for modeling our switching field measurements , we follow the change of variable introduced by kurkijrvi to transform the survival time expression into a survival probability versus field under a linearly ramped magnetic field ( @xmath22 ) . taking the derivative of the probability with respect to time </S>",
    "<S> , we have : @xmath23 @xcite . rearranging terms </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath24 , from which we apply the change of variable , @xmath25 and obtain @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we integrate this expression to get this final expression of the survival probability as a function of field : @xmath27 dh ' \\right ] \\label{sfd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] correspondingly , the switching probability as a function of field is given in terms of the derivative of the survival probability @xmath28 .    for each temperature we conducted 100 switching field measurements under a field sweeping rate of @xmath29 , from which we have determined @xmath30 , the mean switching field , and @xmath31 , the variance of the switching field distribution . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : means_vs_temps ] displays the temperature dependence of the mean switching field and switching variance from 20  k to 400  k. according to our thermal activation model , the mean switching field and switching variance should follow the following expressions valid in the high barrier limit ( @xmath32 ) @xcite : @xmath33^{1 / \\eta } \\right ) , \\\\ & & \\sigma \\cong h_{c0 } \\frac{1}{\\eta } \\left(\\frac{1}{\\xi } \\right)^{1 / \\eta } \\left [ \\ln \\left ( \\frac { \\gamma _ 0 h_{c0 } } { \\eta v \\xi \\varepsilon ^ { \\eta - 1 } } \\right )   \\right]^{(1 - \\eta ) / \\eta } , \\\\ & & \\xi = e_0 / k_b t \\label{sfdd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming an attempt frequency of @xmath34 and an exponent @xmath35 , for a sweeping rate of @xmath36 and an experimentally determined anisotropy field ( @xmath37 ) from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sw plot ] , we obtain a best - fit to the mean switching field for a barrier height of @xmath38 . it is clear qualitatively from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : means_vs_temps](a ) that the mean switching field data is poorly fit by the green hashed line , and that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : means_vs_temps](b ) definitely does not agree with this best - fit parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> recent results on the saturation magnetization and anisotropy energy of similar co - ni multilayered films demonstrated a strong temperature dependence and low curie temperature ( 435  k ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that the bloch law temperature dependence for saturation magnetization provides a good description for magnetic thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations suggest that the temperature dependence of uniaxial perpendicular anisotropy energy in single crystals and in sputtered films scales with the magnetization squared ( @xmath39 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation  [ energy ] for the energy barrier therefore may have implicit dependence on the magnetization and anisotropy : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the activation volume , @xmath42 is the saturation magnetization , and @xmath43 is the uniaxial anisotropy energy . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute a @xmath0 dependence of the magnetization due to the bloch law temperature dependence of the magnetization and anisotropy field and neglect higher order terms in @xmath13 , which is sufficient to fit the entire dataset : @xmath44 where @xmath45 was determined as a best - fit parameter for both the mean switching field and switching variance in fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> the solid red lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : means_vs_temps](a)&(b ) demonstrate the best - fit mean switching field and switching variance trendlines as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we note however , that the increased variance at low temperatures ( e.g. below 50  k ) shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : means_vs_temps](a ) can not be explained within the nel - brown model and is the subject of ongoing investigation . in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : means_vs_temps](a ) , we also demonstrate the fit of our model switching probability density curve to our switching field distribution at 200  k. given our anisotropy field value of 305  mt , we extrapolate a zero - temperature barrier height of @xmath46 . from these values </S>",
    "<S> , we can determine a thermally activated subvolume of @xmath47 , or approximately @xmath48 of the estimated free layer volume , assuming a zero - temperature saturation magnetization of @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> we present additional confirmation of this model on a second nanopillar device in which we acquired statistics from a greater number of switching events , large enough to fit the entire switching field distribution , in addition to the first moments . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : universalcurve ] displays a scaling plot of the survival function obtained from 1000 switching field measurements at temperatures ranging from 120  k to room temperature . in accordance with equation  [ sfd ] , the distributions collapse onto a master curve defined by the survival function @xmath50 , where we have the following expression for the energy barrier normalized to @xmath51 : @xmath52 assuming the same temperature dependences for @xmath53 , @xmath54 as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bloch ] , we obtain @xmath55 and 306  mt for the zero - temperature barrier height and anisotropy field , respectively . from these values , we determine a thermally activated subvolume of @xmath56 , or approximately @xmath57 of the estimated free layer volume , again assuming a zero - temperature saturation magnetization of @xmath49 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the sensitivity of the temperature dependent switching field measurements to the temperature - dependent material properties in co / ni multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> the data is consistent with a single energy barrier process described within the nel - brown model of magnetization reversal . upon introducing a temperature dependence to the energy barrier </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that the temperature evolution ( 50 - 400  k ) of the mean switching field , switching variance and the survival function of co / ni multilayered nanopillars can be described by thermal activation over a single perpendicular anisotropy barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of our experimental data with this simple extension of the nel - brown model of magnetization reversal is also evidence of the temperature dependence of perpendicular anisotropy and magnetization in co / ni multilayered films . </S>"
