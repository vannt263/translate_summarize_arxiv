    "we investigate a model hamiltonian implementing a non - abelian artificial gauge field in a fermionic system .",
    "this model system is of general interest to topological insulator experiments , and directly applicable to cold - gas systems in optical lattices , of which a wealth of proposals have been made to implement these artificial gauge fields @xcite .",
    "cold - gas experiments can exhibit effective hamiltonians with artificial gauge fields through two main methods : geometric phases or rotation of the cold - gas system .",
    "a geometry phase is created when a spatially dependent coupling connects states of an atom such that the aharonov - bohn effect is observed in the adiabatic passage of the atom in one particular dressed state through a closed loop @xcite .",
    "the first such realization of a geometrically induced artificial gauge field was performed within a continuous cold - gas of bosonic @xmath111 with a pair of raman lasers and a spatially varying magnetic field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian of a rotation system can be expressed in the rotating frame , and one finds it is time - independent when the system is isotropic and introduces coriolis terms that take the form of an artificial gauge @xcite .",
    "such rotating systems have been achieved in the laboratory , with features such as a vortex lattice structure @xcite appearing in bosonic systems .    in a lattice",
    ", one can also introduce additional couplings in order to create a continuous flux and the so - called `` optical flux lattice '' has been proposed @xcite to realize topological non - trivial systems .",
    "however , it is not necessary to realize an artificial gauge over the entire lattice . instead , one can make use of the peierls substitution @xcite , which results in a tight - binding model that differs only by a phase factor in either the hopping matrix elements or , equivalently , of the local wannier states .",
    "this phase factor , the peierls phase , can be realized by `` freezing out '' the hopping in a lattice and then reconnecting the lattice sites by an additional coupling as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "such a realization of an abelian artificial gauge field for a square lattice geometry has already been achieved in @xcite by coupling columns of @xmath111 in a staggered optical lattice with raman couplings , where the artificial magnetic flux alternates in sign between neighboring plaquettes .",
    "an extension of such a lattice to simulate a net magnetic - flux , which exhibits quantum hall phases , is proposed in @xcite via the inclusion of a super - lattice potential .",
    "similarly , @xcite have shown that it is possible to generate non - abelian gauge fields by asymmetric lattice shaking and the extension of any abelian gauge field in a cold - gas experiment to a non - abelian gauge field is possible by the use of an @xmath112-state atomic system @xcite . the specific proposal which we follow , goldman _",
    "@xcite , makes use of this idea by manipulating four states of @xmath113 to implement a non - abelian gauge field such that a su(2 ) time - reversal invariant form of the hofstadter model is realized . with this setup , it is possible to realize any rational flux ratio @xmath114 . for large @xmath39 , the edge states associated with these have been reported @xcite to be robust for deviations in the flux of up to @xmath115 . in addition , the non - abelian nature of the gauge field realizes a spin - orbit coupling , which is the @xmath60 term in our hamiltonian , introduced in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "this term has a similar effect as the rashba spin - orbit coupling in the related kane - mele system @xcite , a model that is closely related to graphene .",
    "many other proposals exist for spin - orbit coupling in continuous ultracold gases @xcite which could also be extended to lattice geometries .",
    "the major differences between cold - gas and solid - state experiments are the mechanisms that are available to observe the topological properties and edge - states of the system , as well as the size and structure of the edge that is present . in optical lattices",
    ", it is not possible to perform transport measurements for the hall coefficients , and so one must turn to other options to directly observe these states .",
    "several proposals have been made that use techniques such as bragg or raman spectroscopy @xcite , which directly detect the edge states and can be applied regardless of the trapping potential , time - of - flight measurements @xcite to determine bulk properties , and direct band mapping by the use of spin - injection spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we have investigated detection using bragg spectroscopy in @xcite for the non - interacting version of the system considered in this paper . while it is in principle possible for us to determine the bragg response via rdmft results ,",
    "we have not observed a qualitative change of the single - particle spectra corresponding to the edge states .",
    "hence , we do not expect a qualitative deviation in bragg response for excitations of these edge states compared to the non - interacting system .",
    "in fig .  1(a ) in the main text we presented numerical rdmft results for the critical onsite interaction strength @xmath116 which marks a zero temperature quantum phase transition between a semi - metallic phase and a magnetically ordered phase . the system develops a single - particle gap inside the magnetic phase .",
    "the magnetic order is antiferromagnetic and of nel type .    in this section ,",
    "we expand our analytical analysis of the critical value of @xmath117 which we obtain from a slightly modified version of herbut s argument . in ref .",
    "@xcite i. herbut considers the low energy field theory of graphene in the presence of onsite interaction @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , graphene exhibits four dirac cones at low energies , a factor of two stemming from the two valleys ( @xmath118 ) and a factor of two stemming from the electronic spin . in his renormalization group analysis",
    ", herbut extends the electronic spin from two to @xmath119 flavors and determines the @xmath120function of the hubbard interaction to leading order in @xmath121 . in his notation , it reads @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 with hopping amplitude @xmath125 and dimensionless fermi velocity @xmath126 . here , @xmath127 is the short distance cutoff of the theory that is set such that the fermi velocity @xmath128 .",
    "the constant in the @xmath120function reads @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the number of different valleys . for graphene",
    ", one finds that @xmath131 , but in the spinful hofstadter system one rather finds that @xmath132 and so depends on the magnetic flux per unit cell @xmath1 .",
    "the critical value of the interaction @xmath117 is obtained from the condition that the @xmath120function changes sign , which yields @xmath133 in terms of the microscopic parameters this reads @xmath134 where we have inserted the physical value of @xmath135 , in our hofstadter model .",
    "the fermi velocity @xmath136 is exactly known from the non - interacting band structure of the hofstadter model , and we find that it scales as @xmath137 for @xmath13 in the considered range @xmath138 [ see inset in fig .  1(a ) ] . as a result , we predict that @xmath139 which agrees very well with the numerical rdmft results as we show in the inset of fig .",
    "in the main text we introduce the fermionic tight - binding hamiltonian including interactions and in the presence of the two gauge fields along the @xmath35 and @xmath36 links , which reads @xmath140 with @xmath141 the summation @xmath29 with @xmath142 runs over all lattice sites of the square lattice with lattice constant set to one .",
    "the field operator @xmath143 is a spinor .    at large interaction ,",
    "the zeroth order hamiltonian is given by the interaction part @xmath144 .",
    "to pursue perturbation theory in the hopping amplitudes @xmath145 and derive an effective spin hamiltonian at half - filling up to @xmath146 , we follow the analysis in ref .   and partition the complete fock space into states with singly occupied sites @xmath147 and states with at least one doubly occupied site @xmath148 we partition the hamiltonian as @xmath149 where @xmath150 projects onto the subspace @xmath151 .",

    "contains all possible second - order virtual hopping events . inserting the hopping hamiltonian @xmath160 in eq .   and defining the @xmath161 complex hopping matrices @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath164 p_s \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath165 , @xmath166 are unit vectors and @xmath167 note that the hopping matrices fulfill @xmath168 .",

    "this means that the fast - matrix updates for the solver @xcite become rank-2 updates .",
    "in addition , we were unable to prove that the determinants which must be evaluated will always be real , and so we must consider the possibility of a `` sign problem '' ( or more precisely , a phase problem ) in the monte - carlo sampling .",
    "however , we have carefully analyzed all of our results and observed purely real and positive weights for all configurations that we consider .      from our converged rdmft solutions ,",

    "we have compared these results to that of @xmath203 for some cases and do not notice significant changes in the critical interactions for magnetic transitions .    in our system",
    "we observe two different phase transitions in the presence of interactions : a ) semi - metal to magnetic order . in this transition , we observe a simultaneous opening of the single - particle gap and magnetic order throughout the entire lattice , and b ) quantum spin - hall phase to magnetic order . here",
    "the system always possesses a single - particle gap in the bulk , and so the only noticeable change in the bulk is the onset of magnetic order . near the edge",
