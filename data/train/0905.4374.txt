    "the value of the maximum relative velocity @xmath86 depends both on the laser field strength and @xmath87 according to eq .  .",
    "the end result in eq .   formally resembles the gould - dewitt ansatz @xcite due to the splitting of the collision frequency into a sum of two contributions resulting from the strong and weak interactions .",

    "as expected , all theories agree for weakly coupled plasmas , but large deviations occur for strong coupling .",
    "the classical description is clearly not applicable here as demonstrated by comparison with the @xcite result ( also see ref .   for extended discussion ) . for a coupling strength of @xmath94 , the quantum theories of refs .   also start to disagree with the simulation data .",

    "separately reveals that the hard - collisions term dominates for high coupling strengths and defines the shape of the curve in this parameter area . from this , the observed change in the slope sign is due to the turnover in the hard - collision contribution .",

    "degeneracy might obscure the comparison at low temperatures or high densities .",
    "however , degeneracy is neither included in the md simulations nor in our calculation of the hard collision term which is based on solutions of two - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "we therefore compare our data to the md simulations on a similar level of approximation .",
