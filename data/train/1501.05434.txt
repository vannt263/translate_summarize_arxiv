    "transition form factors ( tff ) are fundamental quantities needed for a detailed understanding of the nature of mesons and their underlying quark and gluon structure .",
    "they play an important role in many fields of particle physics , such as the calculation of the hadronic light - by - light contribution to the standard model value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the search for quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions . moreover ,",
    "meson tff represent a strong `` benchmark '' for theoretical modelling of different processes , being a field in which high precision measurements are possible .    in particular , the most important theoretical advances in modelling the conversion decay of a light vector resonance ( v ) into a light pseudoscalar meson ( p ) and a lepton pair @xmath4 @xmath5",
    "were mostly driven by the @xmath6 discrepancy between the experimental data of na60 @xcite and lepton g @xcite , and the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) ansatz @xcite prediction for the @xmath7 transition for factor .    in recent years",
    ", several theoretical models have been developed to justify this discrepancy @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "a measurement of the pion tff in dalitz decays of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , which was never measured so far , is extremely valuable , since it would allow to expand the range of explored @xmath10 ( the squared 4-momentum of the virtual photon ) to the @xmath11 resonance mass region .",
    "the interest of the kloe @xcite collaboration in @xmath1 is hence justified by the possibility to measure @xmath12 in a kinematical region which fully includes the resonance enhancement , as well as the improvement the branching ratio measurement , currently known with an accuracy of @xmath13 in the pdg world average @xcite .",
    "additional theoretical issues related to the study of this process , are described in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath1 is performed on a 1.7 fb@xmath2 data sample collected at da@xmath14ne collider ( @xmath15 ) , during the 2004 - 2005 kloe data taking campaign .",
    "the signal was simulated according to the landsberg @xmath0 mass - spectrum distribution @xcite , including different tff parametrizations .",
    "the monte carlo procedure accounts also for both the initial and the final state radiation photon emissions .",
    "due to a similar signature , signal events are mostly tagged as radiative bhabha interactions by the event classification algorithm of kloe .",
    "this results in a considerable background contamination from bhabha events at the pre - analysis level .",
    "a huge fraction of this background can be eliminated requiring the following set of cuts :    * the lepton energies in the range : 30 mev @xmath16 460 mev ; * the sum of lepton energies in the range : + 470 mev @xmath17 750 mev ; * the sum of the energies of the photons from @xmath18 decay in : + 300 mev @xmath19 670 mev ; *   all particles in the final state in the angular acceptance @xmath20 ; * the opening - angle between tracks and between the two photons being respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    the other relevant contribution to",
    "the background is from the radiative decay @xmath23 , with the real final state photon converting to an @xmath0 pair in the interaction with the beam - pipe ( bp ) and drift - chamber ( dc ) walls or with the @xmath18 going to a single dalitz decay ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the contribution due to photon conversion can be suppressed cutting on the invariant - mass and distance between the tracks at bp and dc walls .",

    "a further improvement of the signal to background ratio is achieved by asking for : the invariant - mass of the two prompt clusters to be within the window 90 mev @xmath26 190 mev , the missing - mass to the tracks in the range : 80 mev @xmath27 180 mev and the total invariant - mass of the four final - state particles to be compatible within 30 mev with the @xmath8 meson mass .",
    "the agreement between data and monte carlo simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : datamc ] for different kinematical variables .    at the end of the analysis , about 14500 events",
    "are selected , with a total background contamination of @xmath28 .",
    "the background contribution is removed bin - by - bin in order to optimize the statistics of data and monte carlo samples . ] by subtracting the fits to each single background component from data points in the @xmath29 distribution . to improve the fit procedure of the monte carlo shapes , a global fit to data is performed .",
    "[ fig : mee ] shows a preliminary re - binned invariant - mass spectrum of @xmath0 , after the background subtraction and the efficiency correction ( red points ) as compared to the expected distribution for @xmath30 . in the plot , only the statistical error is reported for data points .",
    "the status of the study of @xmath1 at kloe was presented .",
    "the analysis , based on a data sample of 1.7 fb@xmath2 collected in 2004/2005 at @xmath15 , allowed the selection of about 9000 signal candidates , with a good agreement between data and mc in all kinematical variables .",
    "a deviation of data from the mc simulation ( with a constant tff parametrization ) is observed at higher @xmath31 of the @xmath0 mass spectrum .",
    "this can be interpreted as the effect of a non - constant form factor playing a role in the decay .",
    "thanks to the statistics available for data , an improvement of a factor @xmath32 , with respect to the previous measurement of snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite experiments , is expected in the statistical error of the branching ratio measurement .",
