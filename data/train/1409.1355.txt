    "both the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large scale structure ( lss ) in the universe have been used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "especially , the growth history of the matter fluctuation from lss is used to reveal the properties of dark energy ( de ) . although cmb anisotropies furnish the limited information about the de on their own , cmb constraints on the geometry and the matter ( radiation ) content of the universe play a crucial role in probing de when combined with low redshift surveys .",
    "cmb data supply measurements of the observed angular size of the sound horizon at recombination @xmath13 from the angular location of the acoustic peaks to better than 0.1 % precision at 1 @xmath14 @xcite . even though the sound horizon at the time of last scattering , @xmath15 , is insensitive to the properties of de , the comoving angular diameter distance at which we are observing the fluctuations , @xmath16 ,",
    "does depend on the properties of de .",
    "cmb also provides the best way of fixing the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations on the largest scales @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , as a secondary anisotropies the different amounts of potentials decay caused by different de models lead to the net energy change of photons called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "the alternative normalization is @xmath17 , the _ rms _ linear matter fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 @xmath18 inferred from abundances of clusters .",
    "however , this scale is not sufficiently large to remove the non - linear effect and fluctuations at these scales are still well inside the horizon to depend on its evolution .    redshift space distortions ( rsd ) are the consequence of peculiar motions on the measurement of the power spectrum from a galaxy redshift survey . on large scales ,",
    "coherent bulk flows bound to a over density out of voids are coherent towards the central mass which lead to an enhancement in the density inferred in the redshift space .",
    "the enhancement of the power spectrum due to rsd , under the linear perturbation theory assumption with the plane parallel approximation is given by @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a so - called the rsd parameter defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the growth rate and @xmath23 is the bias factor @xcite .",
    "our main interest is to understand the dark - energy effect on the matter power spectrum in a quasi - linear regime .",
    "analytical solutions are presented for the dynamical de model parameterized so - called chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "each dynamical model can produce the same cmb power spectrum as those of @xmath0cdm model by obtaining the proper @xmath25 and @xmath26 fixing all other cosmological parameters .",
    "similar approach for the numerical simulation has been investigated @xcite and the approximate approach using the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) for the one - loop correction matter power spectrum has also been studied @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we obtain the proper values of ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) to produce the same angular size of the sound horizon power as that of @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we compare the cmb power spectra of models . in section 3 , we compare the predicted values of rsd for corresponding models . in section 4 , we obtain the one - loop matter power spectrum of each model using spt and compare it with that of @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we conclude in the last section . in the appendix",
    ", we extend the models including ones will be possibly ruled out in future survey .",
    "the cmb is a power window to probe the early universe . at the last scattering surface , @xmath27 where the photons interact with matter for the last time",
    ", it shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to slightly different densities , representing the seeds of lss .",
    "the pressure of the photons tends to erase temperature anisotropies , whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons makes them tend to collapse .",
    "these two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations with cmb peak structure .",
    "one calls the characteristic angular size of the fluctuation in the cmb as the acoustic scale .",
    "it is determined by the sound horizon at the last scattering , @xmath15 and the comoving angular diameter distance , @xmath16 .",
    "we adopt cpl parametrization of de equation of state , @xmath28 .",
    "the acoustic angular size is defined by _ s(z _ ) = , [ thetas ] where r_s(z _ ) & = & _ 0^t _ = _ z_^ , where r , [ rs ] + d_a^(c)(z _ ) & & ( 1+z ) d_a(z _ ) = _ 0^z _ , [ dac ] + e(z ) & & [ ez ] + & = & . where @xmath29 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath30 is the present value of the matter energy density contrast , and @xmath31 is the matter and the radiation equality epoch .",
    "@xmath32 is measured by the positions of the peaks but not by their amplitudes and this it is quite robust .",
    "also , @xmath32 is tightly constrained from the observation , it can be safely used to constrain the cosmological parameters . from eqs .",
    "( [ thetas])-([ez ] ) , one can find that @xmath16 depends on @xmath28 and so does @xmath32 .",
    "if one keeps all other cosmological parameters fixed except @xmath28 , then one is able to obtain the viable values of ( @xmath33 ) which can produce the same @xmath32 as that of @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we find the viable models and show their ( @xmath33 ) values in table .",
