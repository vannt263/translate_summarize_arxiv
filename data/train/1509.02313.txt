    "the phenomena of flux creep@xcite and thermally activated flux flow@xcite were initially discovered in conventional hard type - ii superconductors .",
    "the  irreversibility line \" in the @xmath4 plane , which separates the reversible ( or flux flow ) and irreversible magnetization ( or flux pinned ) regions , was thought to be exclusive to the high - temperature superconductors and was thus interpreted as a  quasi de almeida - thouless line \" in analogy to the irreversibility observed between the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization in spin glasses and the possibility of a superconducting glass phase was conjectured.@xcite the vortex - glass phase was suggested to be a new thermodynamic phase within the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor.@xcite the term vortex glass was used to the signify the destruction of long range translational order in the abrikosov lattice due to flux pinning by the underlying disorder in the superconducting material .",
    "the irreversibility line was shown to be a sharp boundary across a thermodynamic phase transition between the disordered vortex solid ( or glass ) and the vortex liquid where thermally activated flux flow is possible.@xcite an alternate interpretation of the irreversibility line , without invoking the glass phase in the mixed state , was later offered in terms of the more conventional phenomenon like the flux creep.@xcite these paradigms of high-@xmath5 superconductors were applied to conventional type - ii materials like niobium thin films where it was found that the irreversibility line represents the vortex - melting transition.@xcite the model of the  giant flux creep\"@xcite was extended to explain the _ width _ and _ shape _ of the resistive transition as a function of applied magnetic field.@xcite the key ingredient to the flux creep picture is the estimate of the activation energy @xmath6 which must be surmounted for the flux movement to occur.@xcite the elemental volume of the flux line lattice which moves during the creep is governed by the activation energy and thus gives the temperature width of the resistive transition as a function of applied field.@xcite the superconducting glass picture@xcite and the giant flux creep picture@xcite were thus shown to be _ qualitatively _ similar by accounting for the field dependence of width of transition ( and in - turn the shape of irreversibility line ) without the need for invoking sample inhomogeneities.@xcite the combination of quenched disorder , higher temperatures , shorter coherence length and large magnetic penetration depth in case of high t@xmath7 superconductors lead to a modification of the mean field phase diagram of the conventional low t@xmath7 superconductors.@xcite    an alternate way of studying the vortex matter is to consider the collection of vortices as an elastic object,@xcite instead of treating the problem within the framework of microscopic ginzburg - landau phenomenology.@xcite the rich variety of vortex phases within the superconducting state could be well explained by an elastic theory of vortex matter.@xcite by supplementing the traditional theory of collective pinning@xcite with the concepts of elastic media in random potential , the various properties of the vortex matter could be described in an unified manner.@xcite the application of the theory of elasticity to vortex matter has found similarities in case of other systems like magnetic domain walls , charge density waves and wigner crystals.@xcite the vortex matter has thus provided a model system to study the properties of moving glasses or driven elastic media in presence of quenched disorder.@xcite    in the work presented here , we experimentally attempt to find similarities between the flux flow in vortex matter with one more class of a driven elastic system , namely the flow of a molecular glass or viscous liquid .",
    "we try to address one of the fundamental questions arising in the studies of vortex matter , which is ,  how much distance does the fluxon ( or the elemental volume of flux - line lattice ) move for a finite resistance to appear across the resistive transition in a hard type - ii superconductor ? \" while this question can be of technological importance for tuning the nature of quenched disorder to achieve desirable critical current densities , it can also lead to fundamental understanding of elastic systems influenced by disorder and driven by external force .",
    "we have chosen the nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 alloy for this study .",
    "the nb - zr alloy system had generated considerable interest in the past for its perceived use in superconducting wires for high field magnets.@xcite the @xmath8 phase alloy with the b.c.c .",
    "structure was well studied due to its high critical current carrying ability.@xcite the same composition in this alloy system was used to investigate fundamental phenomenon like the flux creep in hard superconductors@xcite or the scaling laws for flux pinning in hard type - ii superconductors,@xcite which are now known popularly as kramer scaling .",
    "our approach to solve the above posed question is as follows .",
    "we first characterize the microsctructure at various length scales of the nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 superconducting alloy under consideration to know about the nature of disorder which can act as pinning potential for the flux - line lattice .",
    "the estimate of the activation energy required for flux - line movement is obtained from electrical resistivity measurements across the transition as a function of both temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the non - arrhenius shape of the resistive transition draws our attention to a model of viscous flow which has been used earlier to explain a non - arrhenius temperature dependent viscosity across a molecular glass transition .",
    "the model is based on purely elastic energy considerations where the activation energy is related to the shear modulus through some sort of a _ correlation _ volume and is popularly known as the _ shoving _ model.@xcite the field - dependent pinning force in the mixed state of our sample can be explained only if more than one pinning mechanisms are considered .",
    "such a possibility is explored within the framework of collective pinning,@xcite where the estimates of correlation lengths over which the flux bundles are pinned can be obtained .",
    "the elastic constants of vortex matter like the shear modulus ( @xmath9 ) and the tilt modulus ( @xmath10 ) are obtained from magnetization measurements using this framework .",
    "the activation energy for flux - line movement and the elastic constants of the vortex matter are then correlated through the correlation volume of flux bundle to get the estimate of the distance over which the flux - line lattice moves before a finite resistance appears across the transition .",
    "interestingly , we find that the displacement of vortex matter estimated from the shoving model is of the same order of magnitude as that of the flux - bundle hopping length when a finite resistance appears across the resistive transition",
    ". the viscous flow of disordered solids and the flux - line movement in vortex matter appear to be just different cases of the same general phenomenon .",
    "these results could possibly lead to newer directions for encompassing diverse phenomenon arising in periodic systems influenced by quenched disorder with vortex matter as a model system .",
    "nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 alloy ( @xmath11 1gm mass ) was prepared by arc melting the constituent elements of 99.99% purity in a water cooled copper hearth placed in an inert argon atmosphere .",
    "the resulting sample button was remelted six times to ensure homogeneity and was not subjected to any further heat treatment .",
    "the sample was then characterized by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a commercial diffractometer ( panalytical x - pert pro mrd ) with cu - k@xmath12 radiation .",
    "@xmath13 - 2@xmath13 scans were recorded in the bragg - brentano geometry .",
    "a monochromatized ( cu - k@xmath14 ) and collimated ( about 20 arc - sec in the plane of scattering ) x - ray beam was obtained using a hybrid monochromator .",
    "the obtained x - ray peak widths , which were significantly larger than the instrumental broadening , were used for the estimation of particle size and lattice strain .",
    "a small piece of sample was used for optical metallography which was subjected to slow grinding using sic paper and polishing using diamond compound on a soft cloth . after obtaining a mirror quality finish on the surface ,",
    "the sample was chemically etched using a mixture of 70 ml c@xmath15h@xmath16o@xmath15 ( lactic acid ) with 30 ml hno@xmath15 ( nitric acid ) and 2 ml hf ( hydrofluoric acid ) for about 15 seconds .",
    "the microstructure was observed with a commercial inverted metallurgical optical microscope ( leica dmi5000 m ) .",
    "a commercial scanning electron microscope ( philips , xl30cp ) equipped with a energy dispersive spectrometer ( bruker , xflash@xmath17 silicon drift detector ) was used for observing the microstructure on sub - micron length scales and determining the chemical composition at various locations of the sample . for visualizing the disorder / grain structure at even smaller length scales ,",
    "a small piece of the sample was cut from the same parent button for transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) studies . a commercial tem (",
    "phillips , cm200 ) with a tungsten filament as cathode , was used at an accelerating anode voltage of 200 kv .",
    "electrical resistivity was measured using the standard four - probe technique with a home - made variable temperature insert in a commercial superconducting magnet and cryostat system ( american magnetics inc .",
    ", usa ) magnetization ( @xmath18 ) measurements were performed as a function of field ( @xmath19 ) and temperature ( @xmath20 ) using a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm quantum design , usa ) .",
    "we consistently use the si units for all the physical properties reported here .",
    "figure [ xrd ] shows the xrd pattern of the sample .",
    "the peaks which are quite broad in nature could be indexed with the @xmath8 phase b.c.c .",
    "structure with a lattice constant of 3.368  .",
    "to estimate the grain size and lattice strain , we use the williamson - hall ( w - h ) plot,@xcite which is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the plot is between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the full width at half maximum for each of the bragg peaks .",
    "the ( 110 ) peak appears to be anomalously sharp and does not belong to the straight line w - h fit obtained from the other peaks .",
    "the reciprocal of the y - intersept gives the average grain size which is estimated to be around 98 nm .",
    "the slope of the w - h plot gives the lattice strain which is found to be about 1.33% .",
    "the microstructure ( see fig . [ micro ] ) shows a dendritic growth during the solidification of the alloy from melt , which is quite commonly seen in many materials when a thermal gradient is present between the melt and the solidified portion of the material.@xcite the combined results of xrd and optical metallography show that the alloy has probably solidified with substantial disorder due to the rapid cooling it had to experience because of the small size of the sample button placed in the water cooled copper hearth .",
    "the rapid cooling probably did not allow sufficient time for the phase to grow homogeneously .",
    "the composition variation across this dendritic pattern was determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy .",
    "figure [ sem - eds ] shows the microstructure at two different length scales at a random location on the sample surface . when the composition is determined over a larger area ( fig .",
    "[ comp ] ) , it is quite close to the nominal composition of nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 within the error bar of eds measurements , which is nearly 3% for nb and 1% for zr . at certain locations on the protrusions of the dendritic arms ( fig .",
    "[ zr - rich ] ) the zr concentration is much higher than the target composition ( 25% ) and has reached up to 40 % at certain locations of the sample .",
    "these results imply that the sample is a mixture of zr - rich and zr - deficient regions on the local scale even though the 3:1 ratio of nb to zr is maintained on a larger length scale .",
    "figure [ tem ] shows the results of the high resolution tem studies which bring out the nature of disorder in a more clear manner . in fig .",
    "[ mismatch ] the major defects are lattice plane bending , mismatch in interplanar spacing and edge dislocations .",
    "the inset shows the selected area diffraction ( sad ) pattern which shows the elongation of laue spots .",
    "it is known that the lattice constant in the nb - zr alloy system varies with zr concentration.@xcite thus the mismatch in interplanar spacing from 2.61   to 2.42   at a particular location shown in fig .",
    "[ mismatch ] is probably due to composition variation across that region .",
    "this observation is consistent with the results of eds measurements mentioned earlier .",
    "the formation of dislocations ( shown in encircled region ) is most probably due to a large lattice mismatch at certain locations due to compositional variation .",
    "when the strain increases beyond a certain limit in heterostructures , the interface accommodates a part of the lattice mismatch through the introduction of dislocations.@xcite figure [ dislocation ] shows another location of the sample which contains lattice plane bending and possibly a jog at one of the edge dislocation .",
    "figure [ bending ] shows a location of the sample within the dendritic growth where the lattice is heavily deformed due to the composition variation .",
    "it should be noted that no well defined grains ( or grain boundaries ) were observed on length scales estimated from x - ray diffraction .",
    "the sample is mostly a disordered alloy with intermittent disturbances in the periodicity of lattice at very short length scales without any sharp grain boundaries . as we see later , the typical length scale of these disturbances in the periodicity of lattice is smaller than the coherence length , which makes the collective pinning of the flux line lattice@xcite more probable than single particle pinning .",
    "the applicability of the collective pinning theory will also be shown during the course of this article by estimating certain superconducting parameters .",
    "the microstructure of the sample at various length scales shows that the material is highly disordered and this inhomogeneity is expected to manifest in the superconducting properties as well .",
    "it is known that the @xmath5 in nb - zr system varies quite substantially with zr concentration.@xcite moreover the lack of long range ordering in the underlying lattice could also result in a response of the sample which is quite different from the bulk of same alloy system .",
    "contrary to this expectation in the case of the present sample , we see that the material behaves like a typical bulk type - ii hard superconductor .",
    "we highlight this observation before discussing the results of resistivity measurements .",
    "figure [ mt ] shows the temperature dependent magnetization of the nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 sample in a low applied magnetic field of @xmath24 = 2mt .",
    "the measurement was performed under three different thermomagnetic histories .    in the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) protocol ,",
    "the sample is first cooled in zero field down to the lowest temperature .",
    "the magnetic field is applied at the lowest temperature and magnetization is measured during warming of the sample .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath25 is estimated to be slightly below 11k . in the field - cooled - cooling ( fcc )",
    "protocol , the sample is cooled in presence of field from above @xmath5 . the temperature at which the fcc curve deviates from the zfc curve is termed as the irreversibility temperature t@xmath26 . after reaching the lowest temperature in presence of field ,",
    "the measurements are performed while warming the sample in field and this protocol is named as the field - cooled - warming ( fcw ) protocol .",
    "the fcw curve deviates from the fcc curve and meets the zfc curve at a temperature t@xmath27 which is slightly lower than t@xmath26 .",
    "these thermal history effects , especially the hysteresis between the fcc and fcw curves , are indications that the sample behaves like a typical bulk hard type - ii superconductor.@xcite we had shown earlier that in case of nanocrystalline superconductors,@xcite the fcc and fcw curves may coincide because the grain size is much smaller than the flux trapping depth@xcite inside the sample .",
    "figure [ width ] shows the resistive transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in the of the nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 sample in various applied fields . the superconducting transition width is less than 0.1k in zero field which is quite unusual for the sample with such composition variation shown earlier",
    "this further confirms that though there is substantial amount of disorder in the sample , it behaves like a bulk superconducting sample of single composition .",
    "the width of the transition as a function of field is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ width ] .",
    "the observed width can be described by the equation , @xmath28 with @xmath29 = 1.82 .",
    "the value of the exponent is not 2/3 as calculated theoretically for a giant flux creep model or superconducting glass.@xcite however , it should be noted that the quantitative dependence of the transition width on the applied field depends on the nature of activation energy.@xcite the quantitative predictions of the theory may actually depend on the fluxon jumping length.@xcite a deviation from the 2/3 behaviour has been observed in other systems as well.@xcite it is the central aim of this work to find out the distance over which the flux moves before a finite resistance appears across the transition .",
    "it is therefore important to know the exact form of the activation energy as we see next .",
    "figure [ rt - non - arr ] shows resistivity as a function of inverse temperature .",
    "the resistivity can not be explained by a simple arrhenius relation where the activation energy is independent of temperature .",
    "rather , it takes a non - arrhenius form which can be expressed as,@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 substituting equation [ u - h ] in equation [ rho ] , we get the temperature dependent resistivity at a particular field as , @xmath32 \\label{non - arr - rt - eqn}\\ ] ]    the best fit is obtained for @xmath33 = 4 with a regression better than 0.996 .",
    "figure [ rh - non - arr ] shows the resistive transition as a function of magnetic field at various temperatures .",
    "the magnetic field dependent isothermal resistivity can be expressed with a similar non - arrhenius form as , @xmath34 \\label{non - arr - rh - eqn}\\ ] ] with the exponent @xmath8 once again = 4 .",
    "the activation energies @xmath35 determined from both temperature dependent resistivity in constant magnetic field and isothermal field dependent resistivity match quite closely as can be seen from table [ tab : activation ] .",
    "the prefactor @xmath6 is quite large and is not the actual activation energy .",
    "rather , it is the tangential slope of the arrhenius plot and is thus termed as the apparent activation energy.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : disp ]",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the resistive transition of vortex matter in highly strained sample of nb@xmath0zr@xmath1 .",
    "the detailed study of microstructure of the sample enabled us to apply the theory of collective pinning to understand the pinning properties of flux line lattice in our sample and determine the elastic constants of vortex matter .",
    "the non - arrhenius shape of the resistive transition , both as a function of temperature and magnetic field , showed that the models of viscous flow of disordered solids can be indeed applied to vortex matter .",
    "the arguments were based on purely elastic energy considerations instead of assuming any particular model or shape of the irreversibility line in the field - temperature phase space .",
    "our results show that the viscous flow of disordered solids and the flux - creep phenomenon in hard type - ii superconductors could be the manifestation of same underlying physical principles .",
    "these studies should provide sufficient interesting inputs for further experiments which can image the actual flow of flux line lattice and those theories which treat the flux flow in type - ii superconductors as special case of the general phenomenon of plastic depinning of driven systems .",
