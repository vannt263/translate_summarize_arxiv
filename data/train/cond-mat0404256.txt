    "fluctuating polymerized@xcite membranes@xcite have attracted considerable interests in the past two decades .",
    "probably the most striking property that distinguishes them from their one - dimensional polymer analogue and most other two - dimensional systems , is that polymerized membranes admit a low - temperature flat phase@xcite characterized by a long - range order in membrane s normal .",
    "this phase is separated from a high - temperature crumpled phase , with randomly - oriented normals , by a thermodynamically - sharp transition@xcite . at low temperatures , strong interplay between thermal fluctuations and elastic nonlinearities",
    "infinitely enhances the effective bending rigidity , which in turn stabilizes the flat phase against these very fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the resulting flat phase exhibits rather unusual length - scale dependent elasticity , nonlinear response to external stress and a universal negative poisson ratio.@xcite    more recently , stimulated by a number of possible anisotropic realizations , the role of elastic membrane anisotropy was considered by radzihovsky and toner@xcite .",
    "it was discovered that while permanent in - plane anisotropy is unimportant at long scales within the crumpled and flat phases , it qualitatively modifies the global phase diagram of anisotropic polymerized membranes , leading to an intermediate ( in its properties and location in the phase diagram ) `` tubule '' phase . in the tubule",
    "phase the membrane is extended in one direction and crumpled in the other , with its crumpled boundary exhibiting statistics of a self - avoiding polymer .",
    "the usual crumpled - to - flat transition of an isotropic membrane is therefore generically split into two consecutive ones : crumpled - to - tubule and tubule - flat transitions .",
    "fluctuations , nonlinear elasticity , and phase transitions into and out of the tubule phase have been studied extensively@xcite , with predictions dramatically confirmed by large - scale monte carlo simulations@xcite .    motivated by unusual properties of nematic elastomers that have been recently discovered@xcite , i.e. a spontaneous nematic order in an amorphous solid phase and resulting soft elasticity characterized by one vanishing shear modulus , we have previously studied fluctuations and elasticity of a flat tethered membrane that exhibits _ spontaneous _ in - plane anisotropy , i.e. a nematic order@xcite .",
    "such spontaneous order guarantees the existence of a zero - energy in - plane deformation mode corresponding to a simultaneous reorientation of nematic and uniaxial distortion axes , and hence vanishing of an in - plane shear modulus . as in other `` soft '' fluctuating systems@xcite",
    ", we found that elastic nonlinearities become qualitatively important in determining membrane s long - scale elasticity and conformations .",
    "however , due to the vanishing of an in - plane shear modulus , the elasticity of flat nematic elastomer membranes differ qualitatively from that of isotropic and that of explicitly anisotropic membranes : a renormalization analysis of the undulation nonlinearity shows that nematic - flat phase is characterized by a conventional , length scale independent bending - rigidity modulus.@xcite    while bulk nematic elastomers and gels have received considerable experimental and theoretical attention , properties of equally interesting two - dimensional system , i.e. nematic elastomer membranes , have , to the best of our knowledge have not been explored in any detail .",
    "a few ( rather idealized ) experimental realizations of such _ spontaneously _ anisotropic nematic membranes can be envisioned .",
    "for example , one may prepare a nematic elastomer sheet in its isotropic phase and lower the temperature of the elastomer membrane into its nematic state .",
    "the chemical structure of liquid crystalline mesogenic units in such nematic elastomer should be chosen such that they prefer alignment parallel to the membrane surface .",
    "liquid - crystalline polymers adsorbed onto a polymerized membrane can also develop a spontaneous nematic order at sufficiently high density@xcite , which in turn will act as a spontaneous elastic anisotropy to the membrane elasticity . the elastic properties of lipid bilayers with spontaneous tilt order should be almost identical to nematic elastomer membranes that we study in this paper@xcite .",
    "finally , other types of liquid crystalline orders may also be realized in polymerized membranes .",
    "for example , two dimensional smectic order may spontaneously develops when temperature is further lowered in a nematically - ordered elastomer membrane .",
    "this can also be taken into account using a straightforward generalization of our model .    in this paper",
    "we continue to explore the physics of phantom@xcite liquid - crystalline tethered membranes , focusing on the overall phase diagram that results from the interplay of membrane s in - plane nematic and conformational orders . as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasediagram ] , we find that in the isotropic sector of the phase diagram , characterized by a vanishing in - plane nematic order , the system is identical to the usual isotropic tethered membranes , and therefore exhibits well studied isotropic - crumpled ( ic ) and isotropic - flat ( if ) phases .",

    "nematic order @xmath39 acts as a uniaxial shear stress and therefore renders the in - plane elasticity anisotropic inside a nematic phase .",
