    "the inner region of dark matter halos in n ",
    "body simulations is certainly virialized . a precise detection of the boundaries of such a region , however , is a long  lasting and not yet completely solved problem .",
    "if we try just to identify a `` collapsed '' region , @xmath20 a region detached from the cosmological expansion , the task is easier ( see , e.g. , monaco & murante 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "however , in general , a collapsed region is not yet in virial equilibrium .",
    "the point is that , in a cosmological context , each structure is embedded in a more or less homogeneous background , and we pass gradually from the inner halo to external materials .",
    "the aim of this work is to show a precise criterion able to find virialized regions in dark matter halos .",
    "this criterion will be tested on simulations and found to be more efficient than previously adopted rules .    as a matter of fact , several global properties of galaxy clusters , such as mass ( @xmath21 ) , radius ( @xmath22 ) and ,",
    "also , temperature ( @xmath23 ) or luminosity ( @xmath24 ) are strictly linked to the achievement of equilibrium .",
    "analytical predictions on such global quantities were performed assuming that structures evolve from uniform , spherically symmetric fluctuations , preserve such symmetries during their growth and feel no influence from their environment ( gott & rees 1975 , peebles 1980 ) . however , even under such simplifying conditions , a cosmological constant is a significant complication .",
    "lahav et al ( 1991 ) studied the growth of uniform spherical fluctuations within such context .",
    "they also outlined that the most direct way through which observations can distinguish among flat models with different @xmath17 ( matter density parameter ) is comparing cluster abundances at low and high redshift .",
    "the dynamics of the spherically symmetric growth of a uniform density fluctuation , in a model with @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the vacuum density parameter ) , was further explored by eke et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "brian and norman ( 1998 ) gave a polynomial expression for the expected density contrast of virialized clusters , which reads @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and holds at any redshift @xmath32 ; this relation is well approximated by the expression : @xmath33 under the same assumptions , using a press & schechter ( 1974 ) approximation , one can predict the expected mass function of clusters .",
    "the impact of this approximation on the estimate of cluster global quantities could be appreciated only through numerical simulations .",
    "much work was therefore devoted to this aim ( see , e.g. , lacey & cole , 1993,1994 ; cole & lacey 1996 ; carlberg et al .",
    ", 1996 ; eke et al .",
    "1996 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ; brian & norman , 1998 ; gardini et al . 1999 ) . however , in the very analysis of the numerical work , the above approximations were often implicit .",
    "an example is the identification of dark halos based on spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithms , with reference to the density contrast @xmath18 given in eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) . in this work",
    "we shall also use an so algorithm ( described below ) as a selection criterion .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , to work out values for the cluster radius ( @xmath34 ) or mass ( @xmath35 ) , implies a bias . the values ( 1.1 ) are obtained under precise restrictions and numerical work should also verify their impact . in a sense ,",
    "the problem is even more severe when the values ( 1.1 ) are used to define virialized halos without requiring explicitly that they are spherical .    in this work",
    "we plan to find a rule , suitable for defining virialized systems , taking into account that a variety of growth histories led to different final features of virialized structures . a number of recent papers ( sheth & tormen ( 1999 , 2002 ) , sheth , mo & tormen , 2001 ) had a similar motivation .",
    "they tried to study the growth of primeval fluctuations taking into account the effect of an ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "then , in order to avoid having the collapse on some axis going to zero , they set up a recipe to freeze it out once it has shrunk by some critical factor .",
    "this freeze  out radius is explicitly chosen so that the density contrast at virialization for the whole halo is again @xmath18 as given in eq .  (",
    "1.1 ) , @xmath20 in spherical growth models .",
    "in contrast , in this work the use of @xmath18 to define virialized systems is completely overcome .",
    "the point is that the detailed growth history of individual halos , in which different ellipticities and velocity anisotropies played an important role , is not expected to leave major traces on final halo shapes after violent relaxation has occurred during the virialization process ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) . on the other hand , it may result in a significant spread of the equilibrium density contrasts @xmath15 of individual halos .",
    "therefore , when the virial radius of relaxed objects is sought , deviations from spherical symmetry and velocity anisotropies may not be as important as deviations of @xmath15 from @xmath18 .",
    "we expect that the value @xmath18 , given by eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , is within the range of the actual @xmath15 values , but we think that it is important to first test how extended this range is , and how @xmath18 is set with respect to actual values . furthermore , a different @xmath15 implies a different radius and mass ( @xmath13 and @xmath11 ) for each object .",
    "accordingly , we expect that some individual object masses increase and others decrease .",
    "we will explore the extent of these changes on galaxy clusters in numerical simulations of critical cdm models with and without a cosmological constant .",
    "such changes may have an impact on the mass function ( see section 5 and fig .",
    "13 and 14 ) , while some scaling relations might be significantly altered , for instance the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "in order to implement our program , we need a simple and effective rule to identify virialized material in clusters . in trying to find such rule we discovered a precise regularity in the transition region between material belonging to clusters and the surrounding medium .",
    "in fact , the volume occupied by virialized materials is confined by a _",
    "boundary layer _ ( bl ) , whose depth @xmath36 ranges around 50100@xmath37kpc , and whose properties fulfill precise analytical prescriptions .",
    "such a bl has been found in @xmath7 of the clusters in our simulated models and is one of the findings of this work .",
    "the bl is not a physical confinement barrier , and particles can travel outwards and inwards through it . on the contrary , it confines a volume , where material fulfills precise equilibrium conditions , which cease to hold outside it . inside the bl itself ,",
    "the formal condition for virial equilibrium of an isolated system holds , as pressure forces at its upper and lower borders cancel each other ; on the bl , kinetic energy has a minimum with respect to potential energy , and matter density is rapidly decreasing .",
    "these conditions follow from a precise analytical requirement ( @xmath38 requirement ) derived under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "this @xmath38 requirement will be only approximately satisfied by halos in simulations , where the halo geometries apparently violate spherical symmetry .",
    "we show , however , that normal deviations from a spherical shape in dm halos do not prevent them from having a bl .",
    "we explicitly note that we do not _ force _ the bl to exist , but we apply the @xmath38 requirement and _ find _ it . for this reason , finding the bl is different from finding a given spherical overdensity ; the latter always exists when average densities of halos decrease with increasing radii , and this does not imply even an approximately spherical symmetry . on the contrary , we could have bound and relaxed regions which are not confined by a bl : our analysis of numerical simulations shows that this is not the case .",
    "there is also a major difference between the @xmath38 requirement we are defining here , and other prescriptions , such as skid , which defines a halo as the set of all particles _ gravitationally bound _ to the halo itself .",
    "in fact , bound particles are not guaranteed to belong to virialized zones and may belong to regions which are bound but still unrelaxed .",
    "in this paper we shall first discuss when the bl should exist and introduce the @xmath38 requirement used to detect it . to have significant statistics based on this rule and to confirm its validity requires simulations performed with a large dynamic range , as can only be done by parallel computing .",
    "finding and situating bl s allows a better evaluation of individual cluster masses , radii and density contrasts , as well as an analysis of their possible dependence on various physical parameters .",
    "the study of the structure of dark matter halos in numerical simulations can also be put on a sounder footing . in previous analyses ( see , e.g. , cole & lacey 1996 ) the @xmath22 dependence of the integral virial ratio @xmath39 was discussed and found not to be `` useful for defining the boundaries of the virialized region '' .",
    "one of the findings of our analysis is precisely the possibility of detecting such a boundary , using the virial ratio for shells instead of spheres .",
    "1 compares integral and differential virial ratios , showing how much more information appears to be contained in the latter ( see sec .  3 for details on how @xmath40",
    "points are calculated ) .",
    "previous analyses have also stressed halo properties apparently depending `` on how groups are identified '' ( sheth et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the existence of a border , with precise physical properties , secluding cluster material lets one overcome any such ambiguity",
    ".    it may be also important to remember that according to the definitions given above , in this work @xmath18 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are quantities worked out starting from the fixed density contrast given by ( 1.1 ) , while @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 are the same quantities when worked out from the setting of the bl around each cluster .",
    "let us also point out that chb the procedure discussed in this work is not the basis for an che alternative cluster  finding algorithm , such as , e.g. , friends - of - friends , skid or so . on the contrary , our analysis assumes that cluster locations are given .",
    "here we give a different prescription for defining the physical dimension of the cluster , not its position .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give suitable information on the simulations used , which were partially run _ ad ",
    ", for this work . in section 3 and 4",
    "we define the boundary layer ( bl ) and discuss how it can be found in simulated clusters . in section 5",
    "we show the results of our work , and in section 6 we discuss them and some future perspectives .",
    "we use two main sets of simulations , performed with different codes : the parallel ap3 m n  body code described in gardini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the parallel pm art code developed by kratshov & klypin ( 1997 ) , and the parallel tree  code gadget ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the code of gardini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) was developed from the serial public ap3 m code of couchman ( 1991 ) , extending it to different cosmological models and allowing suitable flexibility in particle masses . using this code ,",
    "two simulations were performed .",
    "the first of them , dealing with a `` tilted '' einstein - de sitter model ( hereafter tcdm ) , is the same already considered by gardini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; the normalization of the run was , however , rescaled to yield @xmath41 at the final step , instead of @xmath42 , so that the final abundance of rich clusters is the same for both models at the final epoch ( as ususal , @xmath43 is the m.s",
    ". density fluctuation on the scale of @xmath44mpc , @xmath45 being the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "the latter simulation dealt with a @xmath46cdm model , i.e. a flat cdm universe with non  zero cosmological constant with @xmath47 .",
    "owing to recent observational results ( see , e.g. , schuecker et al , 2002 ) , these normalizations are both rather high , as a reasonable value for @xmath43 in @xmath46cdm models is @xmath48 ; however , this has no impact when studying inner cluster dynamical properties .",
    "the above simulations ( denoted a and b , respectively ) are performed in cubes with sides of 360@xmath37mpc .",
    "cdm+baryons are represented by @xmath49 particles , whose individual mass is @xmath50 for tcdm and @xmath51 for @xmath46cdm .",
    "we use a 256@xmath52 grid to compute the fft s needed to evaluate the long range contribution to the force ( pm ) and we allow for mesh refinement where the particle density attains or exceeds @xmath53 times the mean value .",
    "the starting redshifts are @xmath54 for tcdm and @xmath55 for @xmath46cdm .",
    "the particle sampling of the density field is obtained by applying the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ; doroshkevich et al .",
    "1980 ) starting from a regular grid .",
    "we adopt the same random phases in both a and b.    the number of steps were 1000 equal @xmath56time steps ( the time parameter is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the expansion factor ) .",
    "the comoving force resolution , given by the softening length , is @xmath59kpc , yielding a plummer equivalent softening @xmath60kpc .",
    "these simulations were described in more detail in gardini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and were also used in macci et al .",
    "the parameters of the models are reported in detail in table 1 .    in order to see how resolution affects the results of the @xmath38 requirement",
    ", we performed further simulations with the art code ( courtesy of a. klypin ) .",
    "this allows us to select regions inhabited by clusters and to re  run them with increasing particle mass resolution : from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "the art code ( adaptive refinement tree : kravtsov et al .",
    "1997 , knebe et al .",
    "2000 ) starts with a uniform grid , which covers the whole computational box .",
    "this grid defines the lowest ( zeroth ) level of resolution of the simulation .",
    "the standard particles - mesh algorithms are used to compute the density and gravitational potential on the zeroth - level mesh .",
    "the code then reaches high force resolution by refining all high density regions using an automated refinement algorithm .",
    "the refinements are recursive : the refined regions can also be refined , each subsequent refinement having half of the previous level s cell size .",
    "this creates a hierarchy of refinement meshes of different resolution , size , and geometry covering regions of interest .",
    "because each individual cubic cell can be refined , the shape of the refinement mesh can be arbitrary and effectively match the geometry of the region of interest .",
    "this algorithm is well suited for simulations of a selected region within a large computational box .",
    "the criterion for refinement is the local density of particles : if the number of particles in a mesh cell ( as estimated by the cloud - in - cell method ) exceeds the level @xmath63 , the cell is split ( `` refined '' ) into 8 cells of the next refinement level .",
    "the refinement threshold may depend on the refinement level .",
    "the code uses the expansion parameter @xmath58 as the time variable . besides spatial refinements , during the integration time refinements",
    "are also performed .",
    "the art code can handle particles of different masses .",
    "this lets us increase the mass ( and correspondingly the force ) resolution of regions centered around the highest mass clusters .",
    "the multiple mass resolution is implemented in the following way .",
    "we first set up a realization of the initial spectrum of perturbations , so that initial conditions for our largest number ( @xmath64 ) of particles can be generated in the simulation box .",
    "coordinates and velocities of all the particles are then calculated using all waves ranging from the fundamental mode @xmath65 to the nyquist frequency @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the box size and @xmath68 is the number of particles in the simulation .",
    "we obtained lower resolution regions by merging high resolution particles into particles of larger mass where needed .",
    "this process can be repeated to get still lower resolution .",
    "the larger mass ( merged ) particles have velocities and displacements equal to the average of the velocities and displacements of the smaller - mass particles . using this technique",
    "we firstly generated initial conditions for low  resolution simulations .",
    "these simulations were run from their initial redshift to @xmath69 and they were used to locate the lagrangian regions forming the most massive clusters .",
    "then , we were able to obtain initial conditions at high resolution ( both in force and mass ) in the selected lagrangian zones , with the same random fourier phases .",
    "such zones were surrounded by lower and lower resolution shells taking into account the tidal field which acts on them . finally , these ics were used to run the high  resolution cluster simulations .",
    "the simulations employed here were performed using @xmath70 zeroth - level grid in a computational box of @xmath71 .",
    "the threshold for cell refinement ( see above ) was low on the zeroth level : @xmath72 .",
    "thus , every zeroth - level cell containing two or more particles was refined .",
    "the threshold was higher on deeper levels of refinement : @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the first level and higher levels , respectively .",
    "for the low resolution runs the step in the expansion parameter was chosen to be @xmath75 on the zeroth level of resolution .",
    "this gives about 500 steps for particles located in the zeroth level for an entire run to @xmath69 and 128.000 for particles at the highest level of resolution .    using the art code we performed two simulations : a @xmath46cdm model and a tcdm model , that we will indicate as c and d , respectively .",
    "these models are similar , although not identical , to those of gardini et al .",
    "1999 ; their parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "we identified the clusters in these zero  level simulations and selected the 6 largest mass clusters for each cosmological model .",
    "they were re ",
    "run with increased mass ( and force ) resolution , using the method described above .",
    "for every selected cluster we have three runs with resolutions of @xmath70 ( particles mass @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath79 ) with more than 350.000 particles within a radius of 2.0 mpc h@xmath80 .",
    "we then run 3 out of the 6 high resolution @xmath46cdm clusters with the public parallel tree - code gadget ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) , to verify that our results do not depend upon the peculiarities of one n - body code .",
    "one of the clusters was magnified with both art and gadget .",
    "the initial conditions were set as described above .",
    "we used a plummer - equivalent softening length @xmath81 ; this is also the linear dimension or our highest ",
    "resolution art cell .",
    "we chose the time ",
    "step criterion 3 , based on the local dynamical time , with a tolerance of the integration error @xmath82 , which gave us more than 100000 time steps from @xmath83 to @xmath69 .",
    "the criterion for opening the tree ",
    "cells is based on the absolute truncation error in the multipole expansion , with a tolerance on the error on the force of @xmath84 ( see springel et al .",
    "2001 and the code user manual for more details ) .    in all of our numerical simulations ,",
    "clusters were identified using a so algorithm . as a first step ,",
    "candidate clusters are located by a fof algorithm , with linking length @xmath85 ( here @xmath86 is the average particle separation ) , keeping groups with more than @xmath87 particles .",
    "we then perform two operations : ( i ) we find the point , @xmath88 , where the gravitational potential , due to the group of particle , is minimum ; ( ii ) we determine the radius , @xmath89 , of a sphere centered in @xmath88 where the density contrast is @xmath90 . using all particles in this sphere",
    "we perform again the operations ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the procedure is iterated until we converge onto a stable particle set .",
    "the set is discarded if , at some stage , we have less than @xmath87 particles . if a particle is a potential member of two groups it is assigned to the more massive one .",
    "( gardini et al .",
    "1999 also describe this so algorithm in more detail and compare it with other group identification algorithms , e.g. governato et al .",
    "in this work we set @xmath91 and take @xmath87 so to have a mass threshold @xmath92 .",
    "above this mass threshold there are @xmath93 _ halos _ in the simulations a , b and @xmath94 _ halos _ in the simulations c , d .",
    "tests performed by gardini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that no cluster is missed above @xmath95 .",
    "we have 303 such clusters in a , 316 in b , 40 in c , 36 in d ; 6 clusters of c and d where then blown up to various resolution levels .",
    "finding the volume where cluster materials are in virial equilibrium may seem a tough and somewhat ambiguous task .",
    "if kinetic and potential energies , within a radius @xmath22 , are defined according to : @xmath96@xmath97 the virial ratio @xmath98 should be unity , in a virialized sphere of radius @xmath22 , provided that it is fully isolated . on the contrary , in the real world , as well as in simulations , the virialized volume is bordered by infalling and outgoing material , possibly traveling through a partially depleted area .",
    "for this reason , the convergence of @xmath99 to unity , at a precise radius @xmath22 , should not even be expected .    in principle",
    ", one can take into account such perturbations by fixing a radius @xmath22 well inside the cluster volume and adding a _ pressure term _ to take into account external material , as has been done in observational work aiming to estimate the mass of optical clusters ( see , e.g. , girardi et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly , the virial equilibrium condition reads @xmath100 ( @xmath101 is the volume occupied by virialized material and @xmath56 is the pressure at its borders ) .",
    "( 3.4 ) translates the problem into finding a reasonable estimate for @xmath56 .",
    "the problem can also be considered from a slightly different point of view : if we find , around the cluster , a _",
    "boundary layer _",
    "( bl ) , which is in virial equilibrium by itself , and above which virial equilibrium is lost , its very material and all material it borders , down to the cluster center , need to be in stationary equilibrium .",
    "particles may pass through this bl in both directions , but the overall virial balance shall keep constant in time .",
    "we will now assume that this bl is spherical .",
    "the conditions found under this restriction are , however , well approximated by simulated halos .",
    "this seems to indicate that , even after a strongly asymmetric growth , the final virialization process tends to partially suppress elliptical features .    the @xmath22 dependence of the potential energy can be derived by performing the sums in eq .  ( 3.2 ) starting with the outside : @xmath102@xmath103 where the last term is the very definition of @xmath104 . in the continuous limit ( and still assuming spherical symmetry ) @xmath105 with a suitable density , @xmath106 .",
    "quite in general , a volume integral of @xmath107 increases with @xmath22 .",
    "henceforth , @xmath108 where c is a normalization constant evaluated at an arbitrary position @xmath89 and @xmath109 will , however , depend on @xmath22 .",

    "( 3.11 ) hold on a single @xmath22 , we could have @xmath115 there , with @xmath122 . finding a layer fulfilling",
    "the @xmath38 requirement , goes therefore beyond finding a layer in virial equilibrium .",
    "as we shall see , however , once the @xmath38 requirement is fulfilled , we have found a layer bounding a virialized region .",
    "let us also stress that the @xmath38 requirement does not imply that particles can not pass through the bl ; it only prescribes that such ( possible ) passages do not violate its stationary conditions .",
    "however , if we find about a cluster a boundary layer , it will act as a confinement barrier to inner kinetic and potential energies and mass .",
    "notice that , in principle , inner materials might not be in virial equilibrium themselves ; even in this case , however , there can be no net exchange of mass between inside and outside and the possible energy exchange is limited to the work done by tidal torques due to anisotropies .",
    "let us now show that no further material , outside the bl , can be in virial equilibrium .",
    "we will show that this is certainly forbidden if the values , taken by @xmath123 and @xmath113 at @xmath124 , are a minimum and a maximum , respectively , when compared with values at @xmath125 .",
    "this simple condition , however , is not strictly necessary ; it is sufficent that the difference @xmath126 increases , becoming positive , at @xmath127 .",
    "this will be shown here below .",
    "let us however anticipate that , while the @xmath38 requirement can be fairly easily tested , it is not easy to deal with such further requirement .",
    "the tests performed on a large number of clusters and described in the next sections , however , let us conjecture that , when the @xmath38 requirement is fulfilled , this further requirement is somehow inescapable .",
    "we now show why , at @xmath127 , the equilibrium conditions are violated if a boundary layer is found .",
    "notice that , at @xmath125 , we can still assume that @xmath128 , but @xmath113 , starting from the value it had in @xmath36 , will now vary with @xmath22 and , according to eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , @xmath129 this equation can not be fulfilled , if the difference @xmath126 , vanishing up to @xmath124 , increases at @xmath127 , becoming positive .",
    "in fact we required that @xmath113 is maximum and therefore @xmath130 .",
    "let us finally notice that if a layer is characterized by higher @xmath113 values , this means that it is emptier than inner or outer layers .",
    "a maximum of @xmath113 , therefore , indicates a low density layer . in turn",
    ", a minimum of @xmath123 indicates a low kinetic energy , with respect to potential energy .",
    "bls , therefore , are partially depleted @xmath22intervals , where particles , on average , are particularly slow .",
    "the mathematical definition must now be applied to numerical simulations . a failure to find bls",
    "could be attributed to insufficient numerical resolution or to bad violations of spherical symmetry . however , in principle , even if the resolution is enough and no substantial departures from sphericity are visible , bls could still be absent .",
    "let us now describe our procedure .",
    "after finding clusters in simulations and their centers @xmath88 , as described in sec .  2 , we evaluated @xmath1 and @xmath40 , for spherical @xmath22intervals containing a fixed number @xmath131 of particles ( here @xmath132 of the total mass within 4.5@xmath37mpc from @xmath88 and @xmath133 is the particle mass ) .",
    "however , successive points along @xmath22 are obtained by shifting outwards by @xmath134 particles . in the relevant @xmath22 range ,",
    "the above criterion yields @xmath135 for tcdm ( simulation a ) and @xmath136 for @xmath46cdm ( simulation b ) , while successive points lay at a distance @xmath137kpc .",
    "this is below ( but not much below ) the force resolution ( @xmath138kpc ) , as desired .",
    "we do not expect bl s to be much thicker than our force resolution ; accordingly , we first seek the minima of @xmath123 .",
    "owing to the procedure by which @xmath123 points are worked out , a minimum is considered _ significant _ only if it is such with respect to 8 neighbors .",
    "finding the maxima of @xmath113 is harder , as @xmath139 , obtained by differentiating @xmath1 , should then be further differentiated to find its maxima . in practice , however , this second order differentiation is not needed .",
    "quite in general , there will be just a few points @xmath140 where @xmath123 has _ significant _ minima .",
    "let then @xmath141 be the virial ratio at such points and let us fit @xmath1 with the expression @xmath142 in @xmath143 points @xmath144 , covering an interval @xmath145@xmath146kpc .",
    "the fit is performed in two steps : we first minimize the function @xmath147 just using @xmath148 as a parameter ; then , in eq .  ( 4.2 ) , we allow @xmath141 to take values different from the value of @xmath123 in @xmath140 , and perform a 2parameter fit .",
    "we considered the fit to be satisfactory , if two conditions hold : ( i ) when performing the first fit , the residual @xmath149 ( i.e. , a mean square discrepancy @xmath150 , between the numerical values of @xmath1 and its fitting expression , was our limit of tolerance ) .",
    "this detects r  intervals where eqs .",
    "( 3.11)-(3.12 ) are both fulfilled .",
    "( ii ) when performing the second fit , the best ",
    "fit value of @xmath141 is within 1@xmath151 from the actual @xmath141 value .",
    "here we test that also the slope of @xmath152 is not too far from what is required .",
    "such constraints should therefore select points where @xmath123 is minimum and ( nearly ) intersects @xmath113 .    as outlined above",
    ", one might reasonably expect that a large fraction of clusters , at their boundaries , is far enough from sphericity that the expected system of maxima and minima , as well as their coincidences , is disrupted .",
    "the numerical noise in calculating @xmath113 is also quite large and can be expected to create severe problems . on the contrary",
    ", we found that _ all clusters with mass @xmath153 have at least one value of @xmath140 fulfilling the above requirements _ , while some clusters have 2 or 3 points where the fitting criteria are fulfilled .",
    "in the few cases , when the fitting criteria were satisfied at more than one @xmath140 , we discarded @xmath140 values yielding @xmath15 outside an interval @xmath154@xmath155 .",
    "this selection criterion left us with @xmath7 of the initial clusters .",
    "when more than one @xmath140 was still available , we selected the one corresponding to the smallest @xmath156 ; this last criterion was needed for @xmath157 of the clusters only .",
    "let us recall again that the requirement of intersection between a minimum of @xmath123 and a maximum of @xmath113 was found for spherical systems .",
    "when we deal with the halos of our simulations , sphericity is likely to be an approximation . when a single intersection exists , however , it is natural to guess that this is the point where the @xmath38 requirement is best approached .",
    "however , both in this case and when several @xmath140 points are found , it is natural to perform a closer inspection to make sure that no unexpected feature may bias our understanding of the physical situation .",
    "this closer inspection requires an increased resolution . as described in sec .  2 , a tcdm model and a @xmath46cdm model were then reconsidered within a smaller box with sides of 180@xmath37mpc , making use of the art and gadget codes .",
    "this gave us @xmath158 of the clusters provided by the ap3 m simulations , but enabled us to focus on particular clusters , making use of the art package facilities to increase the resolution there while still keeping identical boundary conditions .",
    "in order to test that the regularities found are not linked to peculiarities of the art package , some clusters were magnified using gadget , instead of art .",
    "altogether we have 12 clusters magnified , 6 for each model . 4 of the latter were obtained using art and 3 using gadget ; hence , one cluster was magnified with both codes showing that our results are independent of the n  body code used .",
    "in fact , the final positions of particles have just minor differences , while @xmath123 and @xmath152 coincide .",
    "a number of subsequent tests also concerned the stability of the minima of @xmath123 .",
    "in general , the number of local minima @xmath140 decreases when the resolution is increased , but the point where @xmath152 fits the expression ( 4.1 ) with the worst resolution is a minimum also with greater resolutions . in just a few cases ,",
    "new minima arise when the resolution is improved ; but in no case is a minimum yielding the bl erased when changing resolution .",
    "the `` worst '' cases for each model are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "here we have a tcdm cluster , taken from the simulation c , which passes from 3 minima ( @xmath70 particles ) , to 1 minimum ( @xmath77 particles ) and , again , to 3 minima ( 512@xmath52 particles ) .",
    "the bl is displaced outwards by @xmath159kpc , when we pass from 128 to 256 ; then , when passing from 256 to 512 , no appreciable shift occurs . out of the 12 clusters considered ,",
    "only this one presents a shift slightly above the resolution of the initial simulation . the @xmath46cdm cluster of simulation d shown in fig .",
    "2 , shows 4 minima with @xmath70 particles , 2 minima with @xmath77 particles and , again , to 3 minima with 512@xmath52 particles ; but when changing resolution , the shifts are @xmath160kpc .    for these 12 clusters we follow in detail the joint behavior of @xmath123 and @xmath113 .",
    "we show them in fig .  3 for the best and worst cases we found .",
    "of course , a precise coincidence between a minimum of @xmath123 and a maximum of @xmath113 would indicate that , within the resolution limits , the system is spherical . seeking this kind of coincidence ,",
    "therefore is somehow fatuous .",
    "furthermore , in order to work out @xmath113 , we ought to differentiate @xmath152 , which is obtained from a discrete point distribution . hence , although the nice coincidence of the _ best _ case is quite appealing , this case is not _",
    "safer _ than the _ worst _ case we show . by tolerating a 3@xmath161 disagreement in @xmath152 , for @xmath162 , we allow for a tolerance @xmath163 on the exponent @xmath113 . in the worst case",
    ", we find a @xmath113@xmath123 discrepancy of this order , but in most cases , @xmath164@xmath165 turns out to be @xmath166 . we tentatively conclude that this resolution is sufficient to show physical features and that the level of the @xmath113@xmath123 ( dis)agreement is a measure of the @xmath58sphericity of actual systems .",
    "the important issue is that we _",
    "always _ find a maximum of @xmath113 to match the minimum of @xmath123 , quite close to the @xmath140 selected at the initial resolution level .",
    "this point can be further illustrated by fig .",
    "4 , which shows a plot similar to fig .  3 , for a typical case at the initial resolution level . both the @xmath123 and the @xmath113 curves are much noisier here .",
    "@xmath123 , in particular , shows a wide set of local minima ; the only _ persistent _ minima , however , are those marked by thick filled circles . as expected , the behavior of @xmath113 is still noisier and most of the oscillations shown",
    "are clearly numerical .",
    "the role of @xmath113 , however , just amounts to choosing among the points marked by a thick filled circle and selects the point marked by a vertical arrow .",
    "even at this resolution level , the presence of a maximum of @xmath113 , close to such point , can be suspected .",
    "when the resolution is increased , this maximum is more clearly visible , while no @xmath113 maxima exist close to the other @xmath123 minima .",
    "a further preliminary test of our technique , concerning galactic - sized and unvirialized dm halos , is given in appendix b.    before concluding this section , let us draw the reader s attention on the setting of the bl around particle agglomeration , as shown in fig .  5 for a @xmath46cdm cluster .",
    "this figure shows that the bl is actually set outside of the main matter agglomeration ; its spherical shape is somehow in contrast with the apparent @xmath58sphericity of the cluster materials and easily justifies minor discrepancies from results based on an assumption of full spherical symmetry .",
    "once the sphere confining cluster materials is set , we can evaluate the density contrast @xmath15 and the mass @xmath11 inside it . in figs .",
    "6 and 7 , points give @xmath15 and @xmath11 for all clusters in simulations a and b , respectively .",
    "they show a rather wide spread of @xmath15 values . by subdividing the @xmath11 abscissa in intervals of constant logarithmic width",
    ", we evaluate the average density contrast in each of them , to seek systematic trends with mass .",
    "averages are still subject to a significant uncertainty owing to the spread of @xmath15 .",
    "they are shown , at the 1@xmath151 level , in the plots . at high masses , some logarithmic intervals of fig .",
    "7 are empty or contain a single object . in the latter cases no error bar is given .",
    "there seems to be no evidence of any peculiar trend of density contrasts with mass apart from , perhaps , a modest indication of an increasing density contrast at very high scales in @xmath46cdm .",
    "it is therefore possible to consider the overall average among @xmath15 s .",
    "this average is indicated by the continuous horizontal line and compared with the `` virial '' density contrast @xmath18 , as given by eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath18 ( dotted line ) is well inside the range of the density contrasts we found ; the average @xmath15 , however , in both cases , is smaller than @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "it is , however , clear that gravitationally evolved , stationary objects are _ not _ uniquely identified with a given , fixed density contrast . in further work",
    ", we plan to deal with the impact of variable @xmath15 on the physical characteristics of dm halos , such as concentration , average angular momentum , density and velocity profiles",
    ". it may also be significant to test our results against the effects of different particle selection criteria , e.g. using the skid algorithm instead of the so one to pre - select the dm halos .    in figs .",
    "8 and 9 we plot @xmath13 against @xmath11 , for the simulations a and b , respectively . here",
    ", error bars account for the variance of @xmath13 around its average , which is wider than the error of the average @xmath13 , shown in fig .",
    "continuous and dotted curves show the expected behavior of @xmath13 against @xmath11 , when the density contrast is set either at the average @xmath15 value or at @xmath18 .",
    "it is also significant to compare the plot of @xmath13 against @xmath11 with the behaviour of the radii @xmath13 against the masses @xmath35 of the corresponding clusters .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "10 , for the simulation a only ; in order to avoid confusion , we omit error bars which , however , are approximately of the same size in both cases .",
    "the highest mass points , for which error bars can not be evaluated , are also omitted .",
    "filled circles yield @xmath13 @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath11 , empty circles yield @xmath13 @xmath167 . @xmath35 . filled circles nicely fit the line worked out from the average density contrast @xmath15 ; only at high masses , where the statistics is poorer , some of the circles are far from this line .",
    "the same line is also a reasonable fit for the open circles .",
    "these , however , are systematically farther at all mass scales . in the figure , however , we also plot an horizontal line showing the average of the @xmath13 values of all clusters with mass @xmath168 . even this average can be considered a reasonable fit for open circles ( an unweighted @xmath156 evaluation gives similar probabilities to both fitting lines ) .",
    "this plot shows that there are actual dangers , if quantities worked out assuming a constant @xmath18 are compared with real data . in this case",
    ", one might tentatively suggest that there is a typical , mass independent , cluster radius @xmath169mpc , quite close to the abell value .",
    "our procedure , instead , outlines that this arises because some clusters were attributed a biased mass and the corresponding points were then set at a wrong abscissa .",
    "although , altogether , this abscissa reshuffling is substantially casual , the danger that an characteristic scale erroneously appears is far from absent .",
    "a critical result of our analysis is however shown in figs .",
    "11 and 12 ( for simulations a and b , respectively ) . in simulations ,",
    "numerical \" cluster masses can be easily evaluated by summing up particle masses .",
    "the actual approach , in the real world , ought to be quite different and is based , first of all , on an analysis of galaxy velocities or x - ray emitting gas temperature .",
    "these analysis make use of the virial hypothesis ; therefore , measured masses of galaxy clusters are estimates of their _ dynamical _ masses .",
    "it is therefore important to test how  numerical \" cluster masses in simulations agree with the masses @xmath170 evaluated averaging over the velocities of the particles within @xmath171 .",
    "this comparison has been often performed , showing a reasonable coincidence between @xmath35 and @xmath12 .",
    "the results of such fit are shown in figs .",
    "11 and  12 by the dashed histograms , which confirm the slight excess of @xmath12 @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath35 already noticed by previous authors . in the same plots we also show the results of a fit between @xmath12 and @xmath11 , obtained on the basis of the setting of the bl .",
    "there seems to be little doubt that the latter fit is better .",
    "the average values of @xmath172 are both @xmath173 , quite close to unity and consistent with it at the 1@xmath151 level .",
    "we have also compared the shapes of the cluster ( integral ) mass functions @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in fig .  13 and 14 ,",
    "upper and lower plots show their behaviors , respectively . in the same plots",
    ", we also show press & schechter and sheth & tormen theoretical curves .",
    "they can be obtained from two different expressions of @xmath176 here @xmath177 is matter density , the bias factor @xmath178 is the ratio of the critical overdensity in the spherical growth model to the rms density fluctuation on the length scale corresponding to the mass @xmath21 , and @xmath179 is the differential mass function , which shall then be integrated to obtain @xmath180 .    in the press & schechter formulation , assuming spherical unperturbed fluctuation growth , @xmath181 while sheth & tormen , taking into account the ellipsoidal nature of the collapse , argue that @xmath182 with @xmath183 ; this expression introduces the parameters @xmath148 , @xmath184 and @xmath58 , however constrained by the requirement that all matter is bound in objects of some mass @xmath21 , however small , and therefore the integral of @xmath185 must be unity . in our plots , @xmath148 is normalized to yield the number of clusters found in simulations , and this constraint is automatically satisfied .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) showed that , in the gif simulations for an scdm , 0cdm and @xmath46cdm models ( see kauffmann et al 1999 ) , a good fit to the numerical mass function was obtained if @xmath186 , @xmath187 .    in fig .",
    "13 and 14 we report the mass function obtained from eq .",
    "( 5.4 ) for these values , for tcdm and @xmath46cdm , respectively .",
    "the fit with the @xmath175 is surely better than using eq .",
    "we also tried to modify the parameter @xmath58 , that , according to sheth & tormen arguments , is related to the density contrast of virialized structures .",
    "as a matter of fact @xmath174 is derived with a variable density contrast , as explained in previous sections , and , however , with an average final density contrast which is @xmath19 below @xmath18 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that a lower value of @xmath58 is needed to compare theoretical predictions with the numerical behavior of @xmath174 . in fig .  13 and 14",
    ", we show the expression ( 5.4 ) , both for @xmath188 and 0.5 .",
    "it is also evident that , while @xmath187 provides a good fit for @xmath35mass functions , the fit obtained provided by @xmath189 for the @xmath11mass function is perhaps better .",
    "the results of these comparisons , altogether , are that : ( i ) no major variations in the numerical mass function arises when @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath11 .",
    "( ii ) variations however exist , which are of the same order of the differences between the standard theoretical expression ( 5.3 ; press & schechter ) and the improved theoretical expression ( 5.4 ; sheth & tormen ) .",
    "( iii ) when the latter expression is used , the fits to the numerical mass functions are best if different values of the parameter @xmath58 are used for @xmath35 and @xmath11 ( @xmath1900.7 and 0.5 , respectively ) .",
    "the differences between the mass functions @xmath175 and @xmath174 are more evident in the intermediate mass range ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "they arise from a widespread  re - shuffling \" among the masses of dm halos , when the two definitions are used , causing thereby different numbers of halos in different mass intervals .",
    "this can also be seen from fig .",
    "10 , where the mean cluster radii ( @xmath13 , @xmath34 ) of halos in this mass range show appreciable differences .",
    "observational work on galaxy clusters made a giant leap forward thanks to x  ray observations and , in turn , cluster data are providing more and more cosmological information .",
    "the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) allowed the extraction of large samples of galaxy clusters , like reflex ( boehringer et al .",
    "2001 ) or noras ( viana et al . 2001 ) , tracing the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe up to @xmath192mpc of distance ( @xmath45 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) .",
    "these data are consistent with the spectrum of a low  density cdm model , with matter density parameter @xmath193 .",
    "also an analysis of the redshift dependence of the x  ray cluster luminosity function , based on a press & schechter approximation , sets a relation between @xmath17 and @xmath43 , which requires again @xmath194 , 0.6 ( @xmath17 : matter density parameter ; @xmath43 : squared mean density contrast , on the scale of 8@xmath37mpc ) ( borgani et al .",
    "such constraints on the model will become more stringent , in the forthcoming years , thanks to xmm  newton and chandra data , providing high@xmath32 cluster samples with tenths of thousands objects ( see , e.g. , bartlett et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in our opinion ,",
    "such fast improvements of the observational materials deserve to be matched by a suitable effort of the theoretical analysis . in this work",
    "we try to contribute to it , by providing an improved pattern to measure individual cluster densities , radii and masses in numerical simulations , without reference to a standard density contrast .",
    "although , both in real samples as well as in simulations , cluster members are directly observable together with their environs , a definition of cluster radii , masses , and density contrasts is needed both for statistical aims , when treating a large set of halos , and for individual objects , e.g. , to compare the observed mass distribution with analytical expressions of radial profiles . in the standard approach ,",
    "a value for the density contrast is usually borrowed from analytical results , which are obtained under assumptions which can be incorrect in the real world , as well as in simulations .",
    "such assumptions , however , were explicitly considered to be the best possible choice .",
    "in particular , cole & lacey ( 1996 ) had explored the possibility to make use of the virial ratio , but considered its value in spheres , instead of layers . here",
    "we see that , passing from the integral to the differential virial ratio @xmath195 , allows the detection of a neat boundary , where a transition from halo to surrounding material occurs .",
    "in fact , first of all , ( i ) this inspection allows the detection of minimum points of @xmath123 in all halos , which could be easily missed in an integral inspection .",
    "some of them are safely shown not to be numerical features , as they persist without appreciable shifts when we compare different resolution simulations of a given halo .",
    "furthermore , ( ii ) we found that , chb quite close to the radius @xmath89 , where one of the persistent minima occurs , there is always a maximum of the function @xmath139 ; finally , chb ( iii ) at the radius @xmath89 , we have also that @xmath196 let us recall that , in general , @xmath139 is defined with reference to the behavior of the potential energy around @xmath89 , by setting : @xmath197 and , therefore , its @xmath22 dependence accounts for the radial dependence of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that the above properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) are consistent with the requirements that : ( a ) @xmath89 sets a neat boundary between bound and unbound material .",
    "( b ) a significant interval ( depth @xmath198100@xmath37kpc ) , where @xmath139 is constant , lies about @xmath89 . we called it a boundary layer ( bl ) . accordingly",
    ", the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath1 , inside of the bl , is expressed by eq .",
    "( 6.1 ) , by replacing the exponent @xmath139 with its constant value @xmath199 .",
    "the relation between the observed features ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) and the properties ( a ) , ( b ) , was shown under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the fact that the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) are not satisfied exactly , but with a ( slight ) approximation , can be easily attributed to deviations of numerical structures from sphericity .",
    "however , such deviations ought to be quite mild , owing to the statistics we performed on a large number of halos , and this indicates that violent relaxation erased most previous @xmath58spherical features .",
    "spherical collapses , however , leave a substantial imprint on the final density contrasts @xmath15 found for virialized halos whose spread accounts for different initial 3d geometries of fluctuations and different interactions with the environment during the collapsing stages .",
    "the simulations used to focus the above properties , at different levels of resolution , in tcdm and @xmath46cdm modes , were run both with the gadget and the art codes .",
    "results do not depend on the code .",
    "we could also extend the analysis , at the lowest resolution level , to simulations run in quite large boxes ( 360@xmath37 mpc aside ) , where we had a large statistics of clusters ( @xmath200 with @xmath201 , for each model ) .",
    "we applied to all of them an @xmath38requirement , meant to detect the bl , and found it in 97@xmath161 of the clusters considered . _",
    "a detailed inspection of these clusters shows that the mass @xmath11 within the bl substantially coincides with the mass @xmath12 , evaluated from the velocities of all particles within @xmath202 , according to the virial theorem .",
    "_ furthermore , a direct inspection of the clusters without a bl , showed they were exceptional structures , mostly due to undergoing major merging , which certainly justified a dynamically unsettled condition and a badly @xmath58spherical geometry .",
    "let us however notice ( see fig .",
    "5 ) that `` standard '' @xmath58sphericity of halo structures does not appear to be a serious obstacle to bl detection .    at present , model clusters to fit x  ray data are mostly built using hydro  codes .",
    "this allows substantial improvements with respect to initial analyses based on pure newtonian dynamics .",
    "there are , however , some features in the interpretation of both kinds of simulations , which rely on a sound definition of the virialization radius @xmath203 .",
    "this radius , whose setting immediately follows from the detection of the bl position , corresponds to a wide spread of density contrasts @xmath15 , and , in general , is significantly different from the radius @xmath204 , obtained using a given density contrast @xmath18 . even keeping to models without hydrodynamics ,",
    "it is clear that using different radii @xmath203 and density contrast @xmath15 could lead to different relations between @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath11 . as a consequence the one  to  one correspondence between @xmath11 and @xmath23",
    "could be lost and it would no longer be granted that a mass function and a temperature function are substantially equivalent quantities .",

    "let us compare this term with the potential energy of the layer @xmath217 also evaluated assuming spherical symmetry and neglecting terms of higher order in @xmath210 .",

    "this profile is found for most halos in our simulations , up to @xmath225 , with a value of @xmath226 in the interval 47 and values of @xmath227 ; this agrees with previous numerical analyses ( see , e.g. , navarro et al .",

    ", it may interfere with the condition @xmath233 , which , in principle , can be suitably improved .",
    "\\(iii ) deviations from spherical symmetry , however , are far from being fully negligible and the discrepancies between @xmath123 and @xmath113 , found in halo analysis , show that a correction of @xmath123 by @xmath234 , would not improve the efficiency of the method .",
    "we tried to find a bl , i.e. to apply the @xmath38 requirement , also in two n  body simulations aimed at studying the evolution of a galactic stellar disk in a cosmological context .",
    "these simulations , performed with gadget , will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( murante , curir & mazzei , in preparation ) .",
    "here we used simulations with dm only ( no galactic disk is present ) .    in the first one ,",
    "initial conditions were set up with the same multi ",
    "mass technique described in sec .",
    "2 , using the art package . a dm halo ,",
    "whose mass is @xmath235 at redshift @xmath69 , was simulated at high  resolution using dm particles of mass @xmath236 . according to eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) , the virial radius @xmath237 mpc .",
    "external forces were taken into account by setting heavier and heavier particles in 3 concentric shells .",
    "we checked that no intruders ( heavier mass particles ) were ever closer than 0.5 @xmath238mpc from the center of mass of the halo .",
    "the @xmath38 requirement was applied to this halo , at redshifts @xmath69 and @xmath239 .    at @xmath69",
    "a bl was found , with a radius @xmath240 mpc , yielding a ratio @xmath241 . on the contrary , at z=2",
    ", we could not find a good fit for the @xmath156 parameter used to implement the @xmath38 requirement .",
    "it should be noticed that these results held , in spite of the fact that the halo concentration is @xmath242 .",
    "this suggests that bl s are found by the @xmath38 requirement also when the condition @xmath243 is ( mildly ) violated ; on the contrary , no bl is found when the _ the halo is not yet virialized _ , as it was at z=2 and is also confirmed by direct inspection .",
    "apparently , the presence of a bl however distinguishes gravitationally relaxed objects from those still in an evolutionary phase .",
    "a partial confirm of these two results comes from the application of the @xmath38 requirement to a second simulation , following the evolution of an isolated halo of nominal mass equal to the previous one , with a nominal radius of @xmath244mpc , generated with a nfw density profile ( see eq .  a4 ) and with initial particle velocities picked up from a multivariate maxwellian distribution ; the nfw density profile was cut off at the nominal radius ; the concentration @xmath226 was set to the value measured in the previous case ( using @xmath34 to evaluate it , as in navarro et al , 1997 ) .",
    "the halo was evolved for @xmath245gyr , to reach the age of the universe at @xmath239 in a @xmath46cdm cosmology where @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "we applied the @xmath38 algorithm , to find a bl at the beginning ( @xmath248gyr ) and at the end ( @xmath249gyr ) of the simulation .",
    "no bl could be found at @xmath250 , when the halo was _ not _ in equilibrium .",
    "apparently , therefore , the presence of a bl is characteristic of gravitationally stable objects , independently of the geometrical distribution of particles . at @xmath250 , a so algorithm , based on a purely geometrical prescription ,",
    "would comfortably detect a halo .",
    "the @xmath38 requirement , instead , which is based on dynamical prescriptions , appears to be more selective than purely geometrical recipes .    at @xmath251 gyr",
    ", we find a layer fulfilling the @xmath38 requirement , with @xmath252mpc , yielding @xmath253 .",
    "this happens in spite of the value of the density contrast at @xmath13 , which is quite large ( @xmath254 ) .",
    "in this ( quite peculiar ) case , the definition of virialization based on the density contrast fails , in spite of the fact that gravitational equilibrium is established .",
    "these arguments seem to indicate that a technique based on the @xmath38 requirement is applicable on a wide range of dm halo masses , even when @xmath226 is fairly large ; mild deviations from the requirement that @xmath255 is constant do not seem to destroy its effectiveness .",
    "further analysis will be performed to put precise limits to the cases when the @xmath38 criterion is a useful tool for telling apart virialized halos from still strongly evolving ones ."
