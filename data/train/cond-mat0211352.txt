    "cementious materials are , however , of much higher intrinsic strength than gypsum due to their chemical shrinkage and are therefore in technical applications mostly prefered to gypsum . while most cementious materials do precipitate as a gelantineous phase , calcium - sulphates appear always in crystalline modifications ( needles ) .",

    "we would like to present some first results for the microstructure of hydrated gypsum based on diffusion - reaction calculations . in the practice ,",
    "the most important feature of the setting of gypsum is the formation of rigid structure of the hydrates .",
    "the necessary condition for this to occur is a connected structure , in other words , that the hydrate aggregate percolates . in this paper",
    "we will therefore investigate under which conditions ( concentration of a hydrate ) the end product of the reaction forms a percolating cluster .",
    "the hydration of anhydrous calciumsulphate,@xmath7 - in the following @xmath8 , is based on dissolution / precipitation reactions forming various calciumsulfohydrates@xcite .",
    "the hydrates , @xmath9 , are distinguished by the molar amount @xmath10 of bound crystal - water . in connection with the amount of physically bound water one observes different physico - chemical properties as for example crystal - symmetries , densities , or solubilities .",

    "+ above @xmath64 increasingly parts of the chemically reactive interface between water and gypsum are blocked by the gypsum itself . for @xmath65 one",
    "has to expect a decreasing specific surface area for the gypsum - which corresponds directly to a decreasing chemical reactivity .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the total volume fraction of initial anhydrous gypsum .",
    "as the hydrate density is a more or less continous quantity @xmath66 $ ] one has to term the statement of percolation somewhat different than usual. looking at the densities @xmath67 , we define a function @xmath68 with the property ,    @xmath69    ( with @xmath70 being the heaviside step function ) .",
    "the function @xmath68 maps just all those volume elements to unity ( red ) for which the corresponding hydrate density exceeds a certain amount @xmath71 , otherwise it becomes zero ( blue ) .",

    "+    2    from these images it is apparent that for very high gypsum densities , i.e. , @xmath56 , the hydrate does not percolate that easily as compared for example to @xmath60 .",
    "this indicates that at least two percolation transitions for the hydrated phase do exist .",
    "+ we employ volume concentrations in this work .",
    "obviously the solid phase concentrations define a measure for the distinct properties . how to define criteria in terms of phase concentration(s ) that allow an analogy to percolation phenomena ? in conventional ( site-)percolation each volume element is either completely occupied by species @xmath76 or @xmath77 at random in an _ uncorrelated _ way with fixed occupation probabilities @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "the constant occupation probability @xmath78 equals the overall density of species @xmath76 , and the formed cluster at the percolation transition exhibits scale invariance ( selfsimilarity)@xcite . vice versa one could employ this scale invariance as a tool in order to estimate the critical percolation probability @xmath78 .",
    "we will follow this approach in the present paper . because the hydrate concentrations directly correspond to non - constant occupation probabilities one could expect _ correlated _ percolation .",
    "the microstructural and topological properties of the transformed phase strongly influence overall ( volume ) properties such as elastic properties . if -as in our case- the unreacted phase owns a small or even vanishing elastic modulus ( anhydrous gypsum is usually a powder ) then the percolating phase controls entirely overall properties .",
    "thereforethe percolation transition of the spatial dihydrate distribution is of central importance to a corresponding transition of mechanical properties for the considered system .",
    "naturally the question arises on how to estimate and characterize a possible percolation transition as for our case .",
    "we introduce the _ typical _ volume density @xmath71 above which all hydrated volume elements are regarded as occupied sites in the sense of percolation .",
    "let us denote @xmath80 as the true overall density of such sites",
    ". in general @xmath80 and @xmath71 will have different values because the overall density @xmath81 depends on the anhydrous volume fraction @xmath1 while @xmath71 is a variable . however , if we guarantee by some algorithm that the occupied sites do _ always _ percolate for arbitrary values of @xmath71 ( scales ) by adjusting the initial @xmath1 , then the overall density @xmath81 must equal the typical density @xmath71 . in other words",
    "@xmath82 which is a fixed point of the map @xmath80 .    in order to investigate this question quantitatively more extensive calculations have been performed",
    ". one can calculate from the pixel - distribution @xmath68 two main quantities of interest a ) its overall density , @xmath83    and b ) the information whether _ the pixel - distribution _ @xmath84 is percolating itself ( via a burning algorithm@xcite ) .",
    "the set of rules _ without _ the fixed point condition is the following :    1 .",
    "choose an initial @xmath85 , 2 .",
    "choose a sufficient low initial gypsum density , i.e. , @xmath86 in order to find later on @xmath87 .",

    "5 .   continue with 3 . until the increment interval becomes lower than @xmath89 .",

    "the data points link the dependence of the density @xmath81 and initial anhydrous volume density @xmath1 for various cutoffs @xmath71 under the condition that @xmath84 is percolating .",
    "it is more meaningful to average _ all _ points for the same @xmath71 belonging to a percolating cluster , and calculate their mean and variance values , which results in one single point with error bars per value of @xmath71 .",

    "this means in particular that within the error bar of @xmath93 there are no different values for @xmath93 for @xmath96 und @xmath97 .      in the foregoing paragraph we investigated a few percolation properties in @xmath0 depending on the initial anhydrous gypsum concentration .",
    "we found that for the case of a diluted ( @xmath98 ) and dense initial anhydride packing ( @xmath99 ) no percolation of the hydrated phase will occur , i.e. the hydrated gypsum becomes useless for most technical applications .",
    "we investigated this problem also in @xmath4 . to this end",

    "[ backbone_3d ] we show a small hydrate backbone , i.e. sites not belonging to a spanning cluster have been removed .",
    "one clearly sees the holes in the microstructure constituting the pore space . in order to determine the further percolation properties we employed the same numerical procedure and parameters as explained in sec.[subsec : results_d=2 ] with the exception of the system size being now @xmath100 .",

    "exist much more connected pathways for ion diffusion and solvation .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that a possible upper percolation threshold @xmath97 is shifted to higher anhydrous concentrations as compared to fig .",

    "we studied percolation properties of a reaction - diffusion model for the hydration of calciumsulphate . from a kinetic point of view the basic effects of the dissolving and precipitating microstructures are a ) that they control the ion diffusion transport to a large extent and b ) that they form a spanning backbone from one systems end to the other , thus allowing the tyransport of momentum / stress .",
    "we expect that for @xmath105 and @xmath106 microstructures are unable to carry stress at all .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xmath97 is not reachable employing mono - disperse packings .",
    "our results also show that there exists an optimum initial anhydrous concentration for which the total amount of dihydrate reaches a maximum , i.e. shows maximum overall chemical reactivity , and possibly the best mechanical properties .",
    "the relatively high computing time for @xmath4 indicates that one possibly should consider in the future a different evaluation method than exact enumeration in order to solve the reaction - diffusion equations .",
