    "introductory and intermediate treatments of electromagnetism usually shy away from a formal discussion of electromagnetic angular momentum and energy.@xcite discussions if any are kept at a qualitative level .",
    "specific examples involving forces and torques as well as the associated work done and the change in angular momentum are conspicuous by their absence . in a series of articles",
    "gauthier has attempted to redress this lacuna.@xcite    in one of his articles gauthier considers a metallic cylindrical shell free to rotate about the horizontal axis.@xcite a string wound around the shell with a mass attached to its free end causes it to rotate with acceleration .",
    "a charge is smeared on the shell making it analogous to a solenoid carrying an increasing time dependent current and associated magnetic flux .",
    "one can show from faraday s law that a retarding torque will act on the shell .",
    "this torque is of purely electromagnetic origin .",
    "gauthier goes on to demonstrate in a pedagogically satisfying fashion that the system s magnetic energy and electromagnetic momentum are stored at the expense of their mechanical counterparts .    in the present article",
    "we consider a cylindrical magnet free to rotate about the horizontal axis .",
    "we treat the magnetic field of the magnet to be constant and pointing along the axis .",
    "a string wound around the shell with a mass attached to its free end causes it to rotate with acceleration .",
    "we assume that the magnet is a good conductor and hence a radial current will be set up .",
    "the magnetic field will act on the radial current giving rise to a counter torque which will oppose the torque due to gravity.@xcite the problem is complementary to gauthier s . instead of faraday s law",
    "we need to invoke the lorentz force , gauss s law and the equation of continuity .",
    "but the perspective is the same as gauthier s : an understanding of the problem involves a detailed consideration of the electromagnetic energy and angular momentum .",
    "we thus present another pedagogical example for an intermediate electromagnetic course .",
    "consider a cylinder with moment of inertia @xmath0 , radius @xmath1 and length @xmath2 .",
    "let mass @xmath3 be hung by a light thread wound on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "we adopt the cylindrical coordinate system \\{@xmath4 } and unit vectors \\{@xmath5 } with @xmath6 being the axis around which cylinder is free to rotate .",
    "figure 1(a ) illustrates the setup and fig .",
    "1(b ) the cylindrical coordinate system we have adopted .",
    "when mass @xmath3 is released , the cylinder rotates with instantaneous angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "we assume no slip condition @xmath8 . in that case",
    "newton s second law for rotational dynamics can be used to show that angular velocity of the cylinder is @xcite @xmath9 where we have introduced a dimensionless constant @xmath10 and a time constant @xmath11    we now replace the cylinder by a metallic cylindrical magnet in the setup .",
    "let the conductivity of the cylinder be @xmath12 and the magnetic field be uniform and @xmath13.@xcite this is similar to the setup described by gauthier @xcite except that we have a solid cylindrical magnet instead of a non - magnetic charged cylindrical shell .",
    "as the magnet rotates due to the gravitational torque of the falling mass , the free charge in the rotating magnet experiences a radially outward lorentz force .",
    "the magnetic field will act on this radial current and will produce a counter torque ( @xmath14 ) which will oppose the torque due to gravity .",
    "the subscript indicates that the torque is of purely electromagnetic origin .",
    "we can write the equation of motion for the system as @xmath15    in what follows we will determine @xmath14 and solve the equation of motion .    consider a free charge @xmath16 at a distance @xmath17 from the axis of the cylinder rotating with angular velocity @xmath18 .",
    "it is subjected to a radial lorentz force @xmath19 .",
    "recall that in literature the effect of this force is discussed in terms of motional emf .",
    "@xcite from ohm s law this motion would lead to a current density @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to note that this current density is non - solenoidal @xmath21 and hence _",
    "charge must accumulate_. this accumulating charge will give rise to a electric field ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be the charge distribution due to accumulation .",
    "associated with this @xmath23 is an electric field which can be determined by gauss s law with the standard pill box construction in the magnet @xcite @xmath24 where we assume that the length of magnet @xmath25 .",
    "once again we use ohm s law to obtain @xmath26 .",
    "the resulting current density across the magnet is then @xmath27 it consists of two terms : the first is due to the motional emf and second is due to charge accumulation .",
    "next examine the divergence of current density @xmath28    from equation of continuity @xmath29 we obtain @xmath30    we assume that initially the cylinder is neutral ( @xmath31 ) . using this , eq .",
    "( [ eq : contu ] ) can be solved to yield @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the reader may have encountered @xmath34 earlier .",
    "when a lump of charge is deposited on a conductor , it spreads out in a very short time and with time constant @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 . in order to maintain electrical neutrality",
    "there will be an accumulation of charges at the surface with the sign opposite to @xmath35 .",
    "hence @xmath37 consider an annular element of radius @xmath38 in the cylinder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_sec ] ) .",
    "the force ( @xmath39 ) on the annular element can be written as @xmath40 the associated torque ( @xmath41 ) on the ring will be @xmath42 the subscript indicates that torque is of electromagnetic origin",

    "( [ eq : j ] ) ) and @xmath35 ( eq . ( [ eq : rho ] ) )",
    "one may obtain the net torque after straight forward integration @xmath45 we pause to note that since the charge density is independent of @xmath36 , the electric field from gauss s law will have a linear dependence on @xmath36 .",
    "ohm s law implies that the current density would also be linearly dependent on @xmath36 .",
    "it now remains to determine the time dependence .",

    "( [ eq : omegamag2 ] ) is same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "also @xmath55 this indicates that the angular velocity in case of magnet is never greater than in the case of non - magnetic solid cylinder .",
    "we consider two limits of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegamag2 ] ) @xmath56 this shows that the effect of the metallic magnet is to decrease the angular velocity from the non - magnetic value ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "a straightforward integration also yields the angular distance traversed @xmath58 once again we note the limiting cases @xmath59 which indicates that the magnetic field slows down the rotation . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegamag2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) and integrating we obtain charge density @xmath60 we remind the reader that @xmath61 and hence charge density is negative.@xcite also , as stated earlier , a compensating positive charge collects on the surface so that the magnet is on the whole neutral .",
    "we have already pointed out that @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 and therefore the electric field is @xmath62    we then calculate the total current density @xmath63 while the net electromagnetic torque on the system is @xmath64 we pause to comment briefly on the time dependence of above quantities .",
    "note that . as physically expected both",
    "the current density and electromagnetic torque are initially zero and they both saturate to a constant value at large times .",
    "the electromagnetic angular momentum ( @xmath65 ) is defined in terms of electric and magnetic field.@xcite in our case we have @xmath66    using the expression for electric field due to the charge accumulation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalea ] ) ) we have , @xmath67    since @xmath68 is always positive it means that some angular momentum is transferred to the electromagnetic field and consequently the mechanical angular momentum is diminished .",
    "one can check that differentiating the above equation for @xmath65 , we will obtain precisely eq .",
    "( [ eq : net_torque ] ) for electromagnetic torque . the mechanical angular momentum of the system is @xmath69 adding eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emangu ] ) and ( [ eq : mechangu ] ) , we see that the terms associated with @xmath68 cancel and lead to the expression @xmath70 as it should , being the change in angular momentum due to the external torque on the system .",
    "as the hanging mass drops a distance @xmath71 , the loss in potential energy is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) . at first sight",
    "it may seem that this potential energy is distributed into two channels : ( i ) gain in kinetic energy of system ( mass+cylinder ) and ( ii ) electrical energy stored in the system .",
    "let us evaluate the contributions of these two channels .    the total kinetic energy after the hanging mass has dropped a distance @xmath74 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the linear speed of the falling mass and @xmath18 is given by eq . ( [ eq : omegamag2 ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the stored electrical energy ( @xmath77 ) is @xmath78 note that the integration is up to @xmath1 only ( see eq .",

    "we need to evaluate the joule loss .",
    "this is given by @xmath80 where the current density is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalj ] ) .",
    "the heat loss in a conductor is due to the collision of the charge carriers with the surrounding atoms .",
    "the collisions result in the dissipation of kinetic energy of the charge carriers in the form of heat .",
    "this motion of charge carriers arises from two mutually opposing processes : ( i ) the electric field @xmath81 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalea ] ) and ( ii ) the lorentz force .",
    "note that in the evaluation of angular momentum ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : angudef ] ) ) we considered only electric field ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the point to appreciate is that in the case of energy conservation we need to also consider the lorentz force since it results in the motion of charge with consequent loss in kinetic energy due to collisions . substituting the current density from eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalj ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 @xmath84 can be evaluated by lengthy and straightforward integration ( see appendix for detailed derivation of @xmath84 ) .",
    "it yields precisely the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : diffe ] ) . thus @xmath85",
    "let us recapitulate the physical processes which are involved .",
    "the magnet rotates due to the gravitational torque of the falling mass . the free charge in the rotating magnet experiences a radially outward force .",
    "the resulting radial current is non - solenoidal .",
    "this implies that charge will accumulate .",
    "the electric field due to the charge accumulation will retard the radial motion of free charge",
    ". the resulting diminished radial current will nevertheless give rise to a counter - torque which is of patently electromagnetic origin .",
    "newton s second law can be applied to derive the angular velocity and angular acceleration .",
    "next , we demonstrate by detailed bookkeeping that energy and angular momentum are properly accounted for .",
    "one may get a perspective on the problem by obtaining order of magnitude estimates of time constants involved .",
    "let us take the radius of the magnet @xmath1= 0.1 m , length @xmath2 = 1 m , density same as that of iron ( 7800 kg@xmath86m@xmath87 ) , conductivity @xmath88 s@xmath86m@xmath89 and magnetic field @xmath90 to be 1 t. let the falling mass be 10 kg .",
    "this yields @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 .",
    "when one uses these numbers then one finds that current density is very small and of order 10@xmath94 a@xmath86m@xmath95 .",
    "thus the motion of the charges will have a negligible effect on the magnetic field .",
    "the observable effects are possible if the magnetic field is unusually large as happens in magnetars with magnetic field of gigateslas.@xcite however it is important to realise that howsoever small the effects due to magnetic field may be they are crucial in accounting for the angular momentum and energy balance .",
    "we substitute the expression for current density from eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalj ] ) into eq .",
