    "the problem of numerical integration , namely that of approximating the flow of a smooth vector field by an iterative scheme given in terms of a difference equation or a map , is one of the central problems of numerical analysis .",
    "if the underlying differential equation is hamiltonian , or volume - preserving , or has some other important geometrical feature ( such as being invariant under the action of a lie group of symmetries ) , then as far as possible one would like to select a discretization scheme which preserves this feature , and this has led to the development of geometrical integration methods @xcite .",
    "for the special case of completely integrable systems , ideally one would like to obtain discretizations which are themselves completely integrable .",
    "the area of integrable discretization has been developed quite extensively , especially from the hamiltonian viewpoint , and a comprehensive review of the field can be found in the monograph @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with a novel approach to discretization , which was used by hirota and kimura to obtain new integrable discrete analogues of the euler and lagrange tops @xcite .",
    "the discretization method studied in this paper seems to be introduced in the geometric integration literature by w. kahan in the unpublished notes @xcite .",
    "it is applicable to any system of ordinary differential equations for @xmath1 with a quadratic vector field @xmath2 where each component of @xmath3 is a quadratic form , while @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "kahan s discretization reads as @xmath6 where @xmath7,\\ ] ] is the symmetric bilinear form corresponding to the quadratic form @xmath8 . here and",
    "below we use the following notational convention which will allow us to omit a lot of indices : for a sequence @xmath9 we write @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "( [ eq : kahan gen ] ) is linear with respect to @xmath14 and therefore defines a rational map @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , this map approximates the time-@xmath16-shift along the solutions of the original differential system , so that @xmath17 .",
    "( we have chosen a slightly unusual notation @xmath18 for the time step , in order to avoid appearance of powers of 2 in numerous formulae ; a more standard choice would lead to changing @xmath19 everywhere . ) since eq .",
    "( [ eq : kahan gen ] ) remains invariant under the interchange @xmath20 with the simultaneous sign inversion @xmath21 , one has the reversibility property @xmath22 in particular , the map @xmath23 is birational .",
    "kahan applied this discretization scheme to the famous lotka - volterra system and showed that in this case it possesses a very remarkable non - spiralling property .",
    "some further applications of this discretization have been explored in @xcite .",
    "the next , even more intriguing , appearance of this discretization was in the two papers by r. hirota and k. kimura who ( being apparently unaware of the work by kahan ) applied it to two famous _ integrable _ systems of classical mechanics , the euler top and the lagrange top @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the kahan - hirota - kimura discretization scheme produced _",
    "integrable maps _ in both the euler and the lagrange cases of rigid body motion . even more surprisingly , the mechanism which assures integrability in these two cases seems to be rather different from the majority of examples known in the area of integrable discretizations , and , more generally , integrable maps , cf . @xcite .",
    "we shall use the term `` hirota - kimura type discretization '' for kahan s discretization in the context of integrable systems .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite the hirota - kimura integrability mechanism has been further investigated and its application to the integrable ( six - dimensional ) clebsch system has been considered .",
    "the integrability of the hirota - kimura type discretization of the clebsch system has been established , in the sense of : _ i _ )",
    "existence , for every initial point , of a four - dimensional pencil of quadrics containing the orbit of this point ; _ ii _ ) existence of four functionally independent integrals of motion .",
    "note that for the purposes of paper @xcite , integrability of a dynamical system is synonymous with the existence of a sufficient number of functionally independent conserved quantities , or integrals of motion , that is , functions constant along the orbits .",
    "other aspects of the notion of integrability , such as hamiltonian properties or explicit solutions , still require further investigation . however ,",
    "it is known that algebraically completely integrable cases of geodesic flow on @xmath24 are related to the intersection of four quadrics in @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the hirota - kimura method of discretization has been recently applied to the classical three - dimensional nonholonomic suslov problem in @xcite .",
    "the above examples of hirota - kimura type discretizations suggested the following    * conjecture * @xcite .",
    "_ for any algebraically completely integrable system with a quadratic vector field , its hirota - kimura type discretization is algebraically completely integrable .",
    "_    since algebraically completely integrable systems generically correspond to linear flows on abelian varieties @xcite , this statement should be related to addition theorems for multi - dimensional theta - functions .",
    "the aim of this paper is both to study how this novel method of discretization applies to a set of algebraically integrable systems in three dimensions , and to see how these results compare with the analogous discretizations of some quadratic vector fields with transcendental invariants .",
    "the former set of systems considered are _ algebraically integrable _ in the sense that they have a sufficient number of algebraic integrals in involution ; however , there are various other ( more stringent ) notions of algebraic complete integrability . through this study",
    "we are able both to verify the above conjecture for a new set of examples , and to gain further understanding of how the integrability of the discretization depends on the algebraic nature ( or otherwise ) of the integrals of motion in the original continuous system .",
    "kahan s discrete lotka - volterra system illustrates the subtlety of this dependence , as we now describe .",
    "kahan used his approach to discretize the lotka - volterra system @xmath26 which preserves the poisson bracket @xmath27 , or equivalently , the symplectic form @xmath28 .",
    "this is an integrable system with one degree of freedom , @xmath29 , @xmath30 with hamiltonian @xmath31 kahan s discretization for this system reads @xcite [ kahandlv ] = x + x - x y - xy , = -y - y + x y + xy .",
    "this discretization preserves the same symplectic structure as the original system of ordinary differential equations , for which it provides a numerically stable integration scheme which appears to retain the qualitative features of the continuous orbits ( which are closed curves @xmath32constant in the positive quadrant @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , as noted in @xcite , kahan s discrete lotka - volterra system is algebraically integrable for @xmath35 . to be precise , when @xmath36 , it reduces to the second order recurrence @xmath37 for the @xmath38 coordinate , which belongs to the class of antisymmetric qrt maps studied in @xcite .",
    "this recurrence is linearizable ( the iterates satisfy a linear recurrence of sixth order @xcite ) , and the map has the integral @xmath39 which ( for fixed @xmath40 ) defines a quartic curve of genus zero ; this is also an integral for @xmath41 ( which can be seen immediately from the reversibility property of kahan s discretization scheme ) .",
    "however , for other non - zero values of @xmath42 , kahan s discrete lotka - volterra system should not be algebraically integrable ; we present some numerical evidence for this in section 7 below .",
    "indeed , since the integral @xmath43 for the original system is transcendental , from continuity arguments one would expect that ( at least for small enough @xmath42 ) any integral of the the discretization should be transcendental as well . further numerical studies , as mentioned in @xcite , indicate that this discrete system may well be non - integrable , with characteristics of chaos only evident by zooming in deeply on regions of the phase plane .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the euler top together with the discrete euler top found by hirota and kimura . in section 3",
    "we describe six quadratic bi - hamiltonian flows in three dimensions , which were presented in @xcite ( extending results in @xcite ) , and are associated with pairs of real three - dimensional lie algebras .",
    "moreover , each of these systems , which we denote by @xmath44 for @xmath45 , is algebraically integrable ; the system @xmath46 is equivalent to a special case of the euler top .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to applying the hirota - kimura discretization scheme to these six systems , to obtain discrete systems ( or maps ) in three dimensions which we denote by @xmath47 , and in section 5 we present the explicit solutions of these maps for @xmath48 ( the case @xmath49 being already included in the work of hirota and kimura @xcite ) .",
    "section 6 is concerned with applying the same discretization method to three other bi - hamiltonian systems from @xcite which have transcendental integrals . in section 7",
    "we present the results of applying halburd s diophantine integrability test to each of the maps obtained , and prove that all but one of them are diophantine integrable in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the final section is devoted to some conclusions .",
    "the @xmath0 euler top is a well - known three - dimensional bi - hamiltonian system belonging to the realm of classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the differential equations of motion of the euler top read @xmath50 with @xmath51 being real parameters of the system .",
    "we recall that this system can be explicitly integrated in terms of elliptic functions , and admits two functionally independent integrals of motion .",
    "indeed , a quadratic function @xmath52 is an integral for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : et x ] ) , if @xmath53 . in particular , the following three functions are integrals of motion : @xmath54 clearly , only two of them are functionally independent because of @xmath55 .",
    "the hirota - kimura discretization of the euler top introduced in @xcite reads as @xmath56 thus , the map @xmath57 obtained by solving ( [ eq : det x ] ) for @xmath12 , is given by : @xmath58    apart from the lax representation which is still unknown , the discretization ( [ eq : det map ] ) exhibits all the usual features of an integrable map : an invariant volume form , a bi - hamiltonian structure ( that is , two compatible invariant poisson structures ) , two functionally independent conserved quantities in involution , and solutions in terms of elliptic functions . for further details about the properties of this discretization we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian systems in three dimensions provide the simplest non - trivial examples of degenerate poisson structures , where the rank of the poisson tensor is less than the dimension of the phase space . in three dimensions ,",
    "a non - trivial poisson tensor @xmath59 has rank two at generic points of the phase space , which means that ( at least locally ) there exists a casimir function @xmath60 and another function @xmath61 such that [ pb3d ] \\{x_j , x_k}= _ jkl in local coordinates @xmath62 ; cf .",
    "theorem 5 in @xcite .",
    "this can be expressed in invariant form , by using the standard volume three - form @xmath63 in @xmath64 to associate @xmath59 with the one - form @xmath65 .",
    "an important thing to observe from the form of the poisson bracket ( [ pb3d ] ) is that in three dimensions the poisson tensor can be multiplied by an arbitrary function while preserving the jacobi identity .    given an hamiltonian system @xmath66 defined in terms of the bracket ( [ pb3d ] ) with an hamiltonian function @xmath43 ( functionally independent of @xmath60 ) , it is clear that the equations of motion have two independent integrals , namely @xmath43 and @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , by fixing the value of the casimir function ( which may not be defined everywhere ) , we can regard this locally as a system with one degree of freedom which is integrable on each of the two - dimensional symplectic leaves @xmath67 .",
    "however , for complete integrability the global existence of @xmath43 and @xmath60 is required .",
    "gmral and nutku made a detailed study of the geometry of three - dimensional poisson structures , and considered the conditions for the existence of globally integrable bi - hamiltonian structures @xcite .",
    "for a given three - dimensional system to be bi - hamiltonian it is necessary and sufficient that the jacobian at an arbitrary point be a poisson tensor and that there exist two globally defined and ( almost everywhere ) functionally independent integrals of motion .",
    "associated with two independent integrals @xmath60 and @xmath43 , there are two compatible poisson tensors , such that @xmath60 is the casimir for one poisson structure while @xmath43 is the casimir for the other . in other words , if the dimension is three then two compatible poisson tensors are completely determined by the constants of motion , and according to a relevant theorem by magri @xcite , provided certain technical conditions are satisfied , bi - hamiltonian systems are completely integrable in the sense of liouville - arnold . furthermore , in this setting there is an invariant volume form @xmath68 ( not necessarily canonical ) which is preserved by the bi - hamiltonian flow .",
    "an important example of such flows corresponds to nambu mechanics @xcite , given by @xmath69 which in these coordinates gives a divergenceless vector field ( @xmath70 ) ; this means that the canonical measure is preserved by the flow .",
    "in particular , the euler top is an example of nambu mechanics in three dimensions ; for other examples of nambu mechanics in optics and elsewhere , see @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite the authors present a list of all non - trivial bi - hamiltonian flows that are associated with pairs of real three - dimensional lie algebras and their casimir invariants ( as described in @xcite ) ; this list extends results in @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "they consider pairs of real lie - poisson algebras defined by pairs of linear poisson structures @xmath71 , and write down vector fields @xmath72 satisfying @xmath73 where @xmath60 is the casimir for @xmath8 , while @xmath43 is the casimir for @xmath59 ( and minus signs are included in order to be consistent with the conventions of gmral and nutku ) . in @xcite twelve such systems",

    ", it is remarked in @xcite that they may be only locally ( but not globally ) equivalent to nambu mechanics , by a suitable change of coordinates . ]    to begin with , we shall be concerned with only six out of the twelve systems in gmral and nutku s list , namely the ones which have non - transcendental integrals of motion .",

    "it has been proved that these tests provide necessary conditions for integrability of a map , in a suitable sense , most usually in the setting of algebraic integrability ( see @xcite , for instance ) , but in general it is an open problem to determine when these tests are effective",

    "the height @xmath232 of the @xmath226-th point on an orbit is defined to be the maximum of the heights of all the components , with @xmath233 being the logarithmic height .",

    "diophantine entropy is somewhat similar to algebraic entropy @xcite , which measures the height growth of rational functions generated by rational maps . in the latter",
    "setting the height of each iterate is just the maximum of the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator , considered as a rational function in the initial data .",
    "however , a huge disadvantage of using algebraic entropy is that one must usually try to guess a recursive relation to generate the degrees of these polynomials .",
    "the great advantage of halburd s test is that it is extremely quick and straightforward to implemement numerically with a computer , and if the map is diophantine integrable then a plot of @xmath238 against @xmath239 should look asymptotically like a straight line ( see figure [ de3 ] ) , otherwise it will have an exponential shape ( see figure [ dlv ] ) .",
    "the main drawback of using the test is that at present it has the status of a distinct definition of integrability , and it is not clear how it is related to other such definitions , like complete integrability in the liouville - arnold sense .    despite these drawbacks ,",
    "it is worth remarking that , at least for maps in two or three dimensions , diophantine integrability is a necessary condition for algebraic integrability .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional map which is algebraically integrable has a conserved quantity whose level sets are algebraic curves . assuming that each of these curves is irreducible , and that not all orbits of the map are periodic , it was observed by veselov @xcite that they must all have genus zero or one ; this follows from a theorem of hurwitz which says that curves of genus two or more have automorphism groups of finite order @xcite .",
    "( this argument also extends to the case when the level curves are reducible . )",
    "if the curve is rational ( genus zero ) , then the map can be linearized , in which case the logarithmic heights grow linearly , @xmath240 for some constant @xmath241 , while a curve of genus one is birationally equivalent to an elliptic curve , for which the heights grow as @xmath242 .",

    "however , in general these level sets can have two or more irreducible components ; see @xcite for several examples with two components in three dimensions .    here",
    "we prove that all of the discrete systems constructed here , except for @xmath206 , pass the diophantine integrability test , before presenting numerical results which show more detailed behaviour of the growth of heights for some of these systems .",
    "for the theoretical and numerical analysis here it is convenient to set @xmath244 ; since the right hand sides of the difference equations are homogeneous ( of degree two ) , this can always be achieved by scaling @xmath193 by the same factor .",
    "the discrete systems @xmath47 for @xmath245 are all diophantine integrable .",

    "it is clear from the explicit solutions , as given in eqs .",
    "( [ s1]-[s3 ] ) and eqs .",

    "similarly , it is natural to consider the maps @xmath131 and @xmath265 together , because the intersections of the level sets of their two integrals are curves of genus one ; the details for @xmath131 are given in the appendix .",
    "for @xmath131 each of the coordinates @xmath193 of a point on an orbit can be written in terms of jacobi functions , which are related by a mbius transformation to the weierstrass @xmath266 function .",
    "for instance , the solution for @xmath181 in ( [ sde4z ] ) is linear in the jacobi sine , which is an elliptic function of order two with two simple poles in each period parallelogram ; this implies that a relation of the form @xmath267 holds , for some constants @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the @xmath226th term in a sequence of @xmath270 coordinates of points @xmath271 , for an elliptic curve @xmath272 given in weierstrass form as @xmath273 ( for some @xmath274 ) .",
    "it is known that , as long as @xmath59 is not a torsion point ( which would correspond to a periodic orbit ) , the height grows like @xmath275 as @xmath276 , where the constant @xmath261 only depends on the height of the point @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath181 is related to @xmath269 by a rational map of degree one , it follows that @xmath264 has the same quadratic growth in @xmath226 , and similarly for @xmath277 and @xmath263 .",
    "the same arguments apply to @xmath265 , this being a special case of the hirota - kimura discrete euler top , whose solutions are most naturally written in terms of jacobi functions .    finally , for the systems @xmath171 and @xmath197 we make use of direct estimates of the growth of heights , based on the original maps",
    ". for both these systems , note that from the explicit solution we have @xmath278 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath279 and @xmath280 in each case , and then note that @xmath281 , and similarly for @xmath264 . from the second part of the map @xmath171 we have [ yasy ] y_n+1= ( ) y_n , which implies @xmath282 where the second implication follows by summing over @xmath226 .",
    "thus @xmath283 has weaker than quadratic growth in @xmath226 .",
    "similarly for @xmath284 we have @xmath285 which implies that @xmath286 and hence @xmath287 , which is weaker than cubic in @xmath226 . for @xmath197 ,",
    "analogous estimates show that @xmath288 and @xmath289 , so this system is diophantine integrable as well .",
    "having proved that the systems are all diophantine integrable , we can compare the theoretical results with some numerical experiments .",
    "for the system @xmath132 we see that the log - log plot gives what we expect : genus zero means linear growth of logarithmic height , so @xmath290 ; this is evident from the plot of points in figure [ de3 ] , which lie asymptotically on a straight line of slope 1 .",
    "similarly for the genus one case , we expect @xmath291 , and figure [ de3 ] shows points which asymptote to a line with slope 2 . in this case the offset , corresponding to the correction at @xmath292 , is function of the height of a point on an associated elliptic curve , and both the point and the curve vary with the initial data of the map .",
    "the theoretical results on the growth of heights for the algebraically integrable systems @xmath47 for @xmath99 , as detailed in the above proof , are confirmed by the numerical calculations , and for those cases we have an exact expression for the leading order asymptotic behaviour .",
    "moreover , one can also look at how the asymptote is approached .",
    "taking the system @xmath132 for example , @xmath293 approaches a constant as @xmath276 , and from the numerical plot in figure [ de3correx ] one can see that this limit is reached in a very uniform manner , in keeping with a correction of @xmath294 to this constant .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath131 , corresponding to motion on an elliptic curve , we see from figure [ de4correx ] that once again the convergence of @xmath295 to a constant appears to be almost monotone .    the non - algebraically integrable cases , @xmath171 and @xmath197 , have some extremely interesting features compared with the others .",
    "first of all , the method of proof used in theorem 4 above has not necessarily provided the leading order asymptotics of the logarithmic heights , but has merely given upper bounds on the growth of the form @xmath296 with @xmath297 for @xmath263 and @xmath298 for @xmath264 in each case .",
    "let us focus on the case of @xmath171 .",
    "upon looking more closely at eq .",
    "( [ yasy ] ) , it would appear that the upper bound for @xmath283 might be sharp , so that @xmath299 ( and @xmath263 would have the same leading order asymptotics ) .",
    "however , studies of particular sequences of rational iterates show that cancellations occur between the numerator and denominator of @xmath300 and the prefactor @xmath301 , which means that the height of @xmath302 is therefore smaller than the crudest estimate for the upper bound .",
    "this weaker growth has a knock - on effect , meaning that the growth of heights of @xmath181 also seems to be much weaker than expected .",
    "indeed , figure [ de7 ] suggests that the correct asymptotics should be linear growth in @xmath226 for the logarithmic heights of both @xmath177 and @xmath181 , i.e. @xmath303 and @xmath304 for positive constants @xmath305 .",
    "for the particular sequence of heights plotted in that figure , a numerical fit shows that @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "we have also plotted @xmath308 for comparison , to show how the upper bound for @xmath263 fails to be sharp .",
    "another surprising feature of this system is that for different choices of initial data we find ( to within numerical accuracy ) the same values of @xmath309 and @xmath310 ; this is in contrast to the algebraically integrable setting described above , where the coefficient in front of the leading order term is dependent on the initial data .",
    "thus we might conjecture that for this map @xmath305 are independent of initial data , and also that @xmath311 holds identically , in which case there should be some deeper arithmetical explanation for this asymptotic behaviour . similarly to the case of @xmath171 , numerical results for the system @xmath197 also show linear growth of logarithmic heights .    supposing that the numerical observation of linear growth of @xmath234 for these discrete systems with transcendental invariants is indeed the correct asymptotic behaviour , it is then interesting to look at how @xmath312 approaches a constant value .",
    "the results we find are in stark contrast to the algebraic setting : rather than the almost monotone convergence seen in the previous examples , for @xmath171 we find that @xmath312 shows rapid fluctuations which persist for increasing values of @xmath226 .",
    "these fluctuations in the asymptotics are somewhat reminiscent of the `` random''-looking error terms that appear in some famous arithmetical functions , such as the difference between the prime - counting function @xmath313 and the logarithmic integral @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether these fluctuations might provide a means of characterizing the difference between discrete systems which are algebraically integrable and those with transcendental invariants .    for comparison with the diophantine integrable examples above , in figure [ dlv ] above we have plotted the growth of @xmath234 for a particular case of the discrete lotka - volterra system due to kahan , which is the degree two birational map given in eq .",
    "( [ kahandlv ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that the logarithmic height seems to grow exponentially , indicating non - integrability of this system .",
    "indeed , the heights of iterates grow so fast that even on a fairly new computer it took 1 hour to calculate the heights of 17 rational iterates with maple ; the value of @xmath314 is of the order of @xmath315 in this case . upon examining the data used in figure [ dlv ] more carefully ,",
    "it is apparent that @xmath316 to very good accuracy , so we expect @xmath317 .",
    "this would mean that the logarithmic height essentially doubles with each step , giving a diophantine entropy of @xmath318 for generic ( aperiodic ) orbits .",
    "this appears to be the same as the algebraic entropy of the map when @xmath319 , which was calculated by a. ramani @xcite . in any case",
    ", this is the entropy value that one would expect for a generic ( non - integrable ) birational map of degree two .",
    "finally we should mention the results of numerical calculations of the growth of heights for the map @xmath206 for various cases with @xmath320 ( that is , excluding the two special cases where the map is already known to be algebraically integrable ) . for generic rational values of the parameter @xmath151",
    "we find that the map @xmath206 is not diophantine integrable , but rather the diophantine entropy is @xmath321 for generic orbits , this being the typical value to be expected for a non - integrable birational map of degree three .",
    "( see figure [ de9 ] for an illustration of the exponential growth of logarithmc heights when @xmath322 . )",
    "these numerical results suggest that while that the original continuous system @xmath170 is algebraically integrable ( in the sense of having two independent algebraic integrals ) , the corresponding discrete system is not .",
    "we shall return to this point in our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we studied three - dimensional birational maps which provide integrable time - discretizations of quadratic bi - hamiltonian flows associated with pairs of real three - dimensional lie algebras , as presented in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for the six cases of continuous flows which are algebraically integrable , the hirota - kimura type discretization provides maps admitting two independent rational integrals of motion , in involution with respect to a pair of compatible poisson tensors .",
    "we have also provided explicit solutions of the resulting discrete systems @xmath47 for @xmath45 , which are given in terms of either rational , hyperbolic or elliptic functions in each case .",
    "these results confirm the conjecture that the property of algebraic integrability is preserved by this discretization scheme .",
    "we have also applied the same procedure to two cases of integrable continuous flows in three dimensions having one rational and one transcendental integral of motion , for which the resulting maps , @xmath171 and @xmath197 , admit explicit solutions in terms of rational functions and either gamma or digamma functions . in each of these cases ,",
    "we have found an explicit formula for one transcendental integral of the map , but the second integral is only defined implicitly by the solution .",
    "nevertheless , this is sufficient to assert that the latter two cases are also completely integrable in the liouville - arnold sense",
    ". therefore the kahan - hirota - kimura discretization scheme preserves integrability even in these transcendental cases .",
    "however , for another example of a continuous integrable system with one transcendental integral , it appears likely that the corresponding discretization @xmath206 is not integrable for generic values of the parameter in the map .    in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the difference between the algebraic and transcendental cases",
    ", we have also analyzed all of these discrete systems from a different viewpoint , within the arithmetical setting of diophantine integrability .",
    "so far , the diophantine integrability test has been applied to various algebraically integrable systems and discrete painlev equations @xcite , as well as to certain birational maps that are not algebraically integrable and fail the test @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results show that @xmath171 and @xmath197 provide examples of discrete integrable systems with transcendental invariants that are also diophantine integrable , in the sense defined by halburd .",
    "moreover , more detailed numerical results suggest that these discrete integrable systems might be distinguished from algebraically integrable maps by the manner in which the logarithmic heights converge to their leading order asymptotics .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour deserves to be studied more carefully in the future .",
    "a further interesting point is the comparison with kahan s discretization of the lotka - volterra system , which is an integrable flow in the plane with a transcendental integral .",
    "the discrete system provides a non - standard symplectic integrator of this flow , and seems to preserve the qualitative features of the continuous counterpart .",
    "however , the numerical results indicate that the discrete system is not diophantine integrable , which adds further evidence to the conjecture that ( for generic values of @xmath323 ) it should not be liouville integrable either .",
    "similar considerations apply to the discrete system @xmath206 : numerically it appears that for generic values of the parameter @xmath151 , it fails the diophantine integrability test .",
    "since the continuous system @xmath170 has algebraic integrals for @xmath247 , this means that in general algebraic integrability ( in the weakest sense of the term ) is not preserved by the kahan - hirota - kimura discretization .",
    "actually one could already observe this for the system @xmath168 , since it has the integral @xmath161 which is algebraic for all @xmath247 , but the integral @xmath324 for @xmath171 is transcendental unless @xmath325 .",
    "this suggests that one should impose a much stronger notion of algebraic complete integrability ( a.c.i . ) if this is to be preserved by the discretization scheme .",
    "for instance , one can require that the generic level sets of the integrals are smooth abelian varieties , possibly extended by @xmath326 for some @xmath327 .",
    "an excellent discussion of various different definitions of a.c.i . can be found in chapter v of @xcite .    as for the case of the discrete three - dimensional euler top ( see @xcite ) , there is one other standard attribute of integrable systems that remains to be found for the maps @xmath47 for @xmath245 , namely their lax representation .",
    "this is an open problem which deserves further investigation .",
    "there are three other bi - hamiltonian flows in the list of gmral and nutku , all of which have one transcendental invariant .",

    "the first order recurrence relations for @xmath193 , namely [ de4eq ] & & x_n+1-x_n = -(x_n+1z_n + x_n z_n+1 ) , [ de4eq1 ] + & & y_n+1-y_n = ( y_n+1 z_n + y_n z_n+1 ) , [ de4eq2 ] + & & z_n+1-z_n = 2(x_n+1 x_n - y_n y_n+1 ) , [ de4eq3 ] correspond to a birational map from this curve to itself , inducing an automorphism of an isomorphic elliptic curve ( i.e. a plane curve defined by a weierstrass cubic ) , and it follows that @xmath339 for a suitable elliptic function @xmath270 , and similarly for @xmath340 .",
    "one can see some points on a real connected component of such a curve in figure [ de4curve ] .    from the equations for @xmath328 it is easy to see that the functions corresponding to @xmath193 each have simple poles at the same places , and they are elliptic functions of order two .",
    "these facts suggest that it may be most convenient to write the formulae in terms of jacobian ( rather than weierstrassian ) elliptic functions . indeed ,",
    "if we set @xmath341 then the equations for @xmath328 become @xmath342 which are reminiscent of ( linear combinations of ) the quadratic relations @xmath343 for jacobi functions .    in order to obtain the formulae ( [ sde4x]-[sde4z ] ) , it is instructive to take a detour through jacobi theta functions , by deriving bilinear equations from eqs .",
    "( [ de4eq1]-[de4eq3 ] ) . upon setting @xmath344 the system ( [ de4eq ] ) is equivalent to the following three bilinear equations : @xmath345 one should hesitate to call ( [ de4bil ] ) the hirota bilinear form of eqs .",
    "( [ de4eq1]-[de4eq3 ] ) , because there are four unknowns ( tau - functions ) @xmath346 but only three equations , so the system is underdetermined . despite this apparent problem , we can solve this bilinear system in terms of jacobi theta functions @xmath347 , @xmath348 , by comparing these equations with the identities in exercise number 3 on page 488 of @xcite ; the first of these is the relation [ thetarel ] _ 1 ( uv ) _ 2 ( uv)_3_4 = _ 1 ( u ) _ 2 ( u)_3(v)_4(v ) _ 3 ( u ) _ 4 ( u)_1(v)_2(v ) the last is [ thetarel2 ] _ 3 ( uv ) _ 4 ( uv)_3_4 = _ 3 ( u ) _ 4 ( u)_3(v)_4(v ) _ 1 ( u ) _ 2 ( u)_1(v)_2(v ) and there are four other relations of this kind , for different permutations of the four indices . here",

    "these identifications are consistent with the second and third equations in ( [ de4bil ] ) , which are consequences of the aforementioned other four bilinear relations between jacobi theta functions .    given that the jacobian elliptic functions are defined in terms of theta functions by @xmath359 it follows that the solution of the difference equations ( [ de4eq ] ) has the form & & x_n = ( + 2n ) + ( + 2n ) , + & & y_n = ( + 2n ) - ( + 2n ) , + & & z_n = ( + 2n ) , for constants @xmath360 and suitable prefactors @xmath361 which are given in terms of @xmath142 and the theta constants .",
    "the expressions ( [ sde4x]-[sde4z ] ) can also be verified directly from the addition formula for @xmath124 , namely [ snadd ] ( u+v ) = , as well as the analogous formulae for @xmath125 and @xmath126 . using ( [ snadd ] ) to calculate @xmath362 , and then setting @xmath363 , @xmath364 ,",

    "<S> we consider algebraically integrable systems that are associated with pairs of lie - poisson algebras in three dimensions , as presented by gmral and nutku , and construct birational maps that discretize them according to the scheme of kahan and hirota - kimura . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the maps thus obtained are also bi - hamiltonian , with pairs of compatible poisson brackets that are one - parameter deformations of the original lie - poisson algebras , and hence they are completely integrable . for comparison , we also present analogous discretizations for three bi - hamiltonian systems that have a transcendental invariant , and finally we analyze all of the maps obtained from the viewpoint of halburd s diophantine integrability criterion . </S>"
