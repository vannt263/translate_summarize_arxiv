    "the spectral theory of the fractals , which are similar to the infinite sierpinski gasket ( i.e. the spectral theory of the corresponding laplacians ) is well understood ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "the next natural step in the spectral theory is to study schrdinger type operators , i.e. , fractal laplacian perturbed by a potential .",
    "there are two possible directions for such a development : analysis of the random anderson hamiltonians ( the potential is stationary in space ) or the study of the classical problem on the negative spectrum when the potential vanishes at infinity . for the first direction ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the second problem in a particular case of the simplest fractal object : dyson s hierarchical laplacian perturbed by a decaying potential .",
    "our goal is to prove the cwikel - lieb - rozenblum ( clr ) estimates for the number of negative eigenvalues and estimates for lieb - thirring ( lt ) sums .",
    "these estimates depend on the spectral dimension @xmath1 of the fractal ( which can take an arbitrary positive value . )",
    "the most important part of the paper is the analysis of the spectral bifurcation near the critical dimension @xmath2 .",

    "the concept of the hierarchical structure was proposed by f. dyson @xcite in his theory of 1-d ferromagnetic phase transitions .",
