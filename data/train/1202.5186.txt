    "macroscopic models for vehicular traffic have been first introduced by lighthill and whitham @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the continuity equation for the density @xmath0 closing the equation by an equilibrium assumption on the mean velocity @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is approximated by a uniquely determined equilibrium value , @xcite .",
    "an additional momentum equation for @xmath1 has been introduced by payne and whitham in @xcite in analogy to fluid dynamics . to avoid certain inconsistencies , like wrong way traffic , of models such as the payne / whitham model",
    "a new macroscopic model has been introduced by aw and rascle @xcite , see also @xcite or @xcite .",
    "these models have been subsequently improved , for example , in @xcite .",
    "kinetic equations for vehicular traffic can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "procedures to derive macroscopic traffic equations including the aw / rascle model from underlying kinetic models have been performed in different ways by several authors , see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these procedures are developed in analogy to the transition from the kinetic theory of gases to continuum gas dynamics .    in the present paper",
    "these derivations are reviewed .",
    "a closer analysis shows that aw - rascle type traffic equations can be derived from kinetic problems for certain choices of kinetic parameters . for other choices ,",
    "however , new equations with hamilton - jacobi terms are derived .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following way : in section [ the kinetic model ] different reduced kinetic models are presented .",
    "section [ derivation of macroscopic models ] contains the derivation of the macroscopic models mentioned above .",
    "section [ associated ] contains the associated microscopic traffic flow models .",
    "finally , in section [ numerical investigations ] numerical results are given comparing the derived macroscopic equations for several nonhomogeneous traffic flow situation .",
    "the kinetic models presented in this section are based on work in @xcite and describe highway traffic in a cumulative way averaging over all lanes .",
    "these models are given by integro - differential and fokker - planck type equations respectively .",
    "in particular , the fokker - planck type models are changed allowing only for densities below a maximal density and for a better comparison of the models .",
    "the basic quantity in a kinetic approach is the single car distribution @xmath2 describing the ( number ) density of cars at @xmath3 with velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the total density @xmath0 on the highway is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the maximal velocity .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the probability distribution in @xmath4 of cars at @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "then , the mean velocity is @xmath9    an important role is played by the distribution @xmath10 of pairs of cars being at the spatial point @xmath3 with velocity @xmath4 and leading cars at @xmath11 with velocity @xmath12 .",
    "this distribution function has to be approximated by the one - vehicle distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "usually , a chaos assumption is used , @xmath13 compare nelson @xcite . for a vehicle with velocity @xmath4 the function",
    "@xmath14 denotes the distribution of leading vehicles with distance @xmath15 under the assumption that the velocities of the vehicles are distributed according to the distribution function @xmath16",
    ".    moreover , we introduce thresholds for braking ( @xmath17 ) and acceleration ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 are reaction times .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the minimal distance between the vehicles . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the following as constants .",
    "the distribution of leading vehicles @xmath14 is prescribed a priori .",
    "the main properties , which @xmath14 has to fulfill are positivity , @xmath24 and @xmath25 equation ( [ meanvalue ] ) means that the average headway of the cars is @xmath26 . here , the leading vehicles are assumed to be distributed in an uncorrelated way with a minimal distance @xmath23 from the car under consideration , see nelson @xcite : @xmath27 the reduced density @xmath28 has to be defined in such a way , that ( [ meanvalue ] ) is fulfilled . one obtains @xmath29    the reduced density @xmath28 must be positive , i.e. @xmath30    we note that @xmath31 and @xmath32    moreover , from phenomenological considerations the probability of braking can be derived as @xmath33 see @xcite .",
    "these basic considerations can be used to develop different kinetic models .",
    "a first kinetic model is derived using classical boltzmann arguments .",
    "it is given by the following evolution equation for the distribution function @xmath16 , see @xcite :    @xmath34   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath35    @xmath36 stand for gain and loss terms resulting from braking interactions , @xmath37 result from accelerating interactions .",
    "reaching the braking line the vehicle brakes , such that the new velocity @xmath4 is distributed with a distribution function @xmath38 depending on the old velocities @xmath39 .",
    "for acceleration , the new velocity is distributed according to @xmath40 .    in @xcite",
    "additionally a relaxation term is introduced , describing a random behaviour of the drivers .",
    "it is given by @xmath41 this term is necessary as long as one is interested in a more detailed investigation of the stationary solutions of the kinetic model and the resulting fundamental diagrams .",
    "however , in the present investigation we aim at deriving different macroscopic equations without relaxation terms on the right hand side .",
    "for such a derivation it is sufficient to consider the simplified version above . for further remarks on this boltzmann / enskog approach to traffic flow modelling see @xcite .      for the probability distributions @xmath42 we choose the following simple expressions ,",
    "see @xcite : @xmath43 } ( v)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 } ( v).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means we have an equidistribution of the new velocities between the velocity of the car and the velocity of its leading car .",

    "we denote by @xmath48 again the macroscopic density and speed associated with @xmath49    to define the braking and acceleration behaviour of drivers in response to traffic situations , we use the following braking / acceleration forces as functions of the traffic conditions . slightly changing the approach in @xcite , i.e. adding the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we consider @xmath52(t , x , v ) \\;=\\ ; \\begin{cases }                              - q_b p_b c_\\eta \\vert v - u^b \\vert^\\eta\\ , & \\quad v\\,>\\,u^b \\\\[2 mm ]                     q_a c_\\eta \\vert u^a - v\\vert ^\\eta & \\quad v\\,\\leq\\,u^b \\text { and } v\\,\\leq\\,u^a \\\\[2 mm ]                             0 & \\quad \\text{else }                     \\end{cases } \\end{split } \\label{power_term}\\ ] ] again we look at two examples , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 with @xmath56 a reference velocity if @xmath53 and @xmath57 dimensionless if @xmath54 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "similar to the case of the integro - differential equation , we use for the present investigation a simplified version of the kinetic model , see also @xcite . in the original version of the model in @xcite a diffusion term @xmath60 \\partial_v f )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61(\\rho , u , v ) = \\begin{bmatrix } \\sigma(\\rho^b , u^b ) |v - u^b|^\\gamma &   v > u^b \\\\ \\sigma(\\rho^a , u^a ) |v - u^a|^\\gamma &   \\mbox { else }   \\end{bmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 has been added to the right hand side of the above equation . details of the function @xmath63 can be found in reference  @xcite . for the presentation here we neglect this diffusion term .",
    "it is however necessary to obtain smooth homogeneous solutions .",
    "in this section macroscopic equations for density and mean velocity are derived following the procedure in @xcite . among these equations",
    "are new hamilton - jacobi type traffic equations which have not been discussed up to now in literature .",
    "this section shows that the resulting equations do not depend on the the different kinetic models used , but rather on the type of interaction terms . using simplified closure relations explicit results",
    "are obtained compared to the numerical closures in @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting equations are still more detailed than the usually used macroscopic models .      multiplying the inhomogeneous kinetic equation ( [ kinetic2 ] ) or ( [ fp ] ) with @xmath64 and @xmath4 and integrating it with respect to @xmath4 one obtains the following set of balance equations : @xmath65 with the traffic pressure @xmath66 and the flux term @xmath67    to obtain closed equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 one has to specify the dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath69 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      to approximate the distribution function we use the simplest possible one node quadrature ansatz disregarding fluctuations in the distribution function .",
    "that means , we use @xmath70 for the distribution function in ( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ ens ] ) to approximate the true distribution @xmath16 and to close the equations , compare @xcite for such an ansatz in the traffic case or @xcite for a similar procedure for interacting particle systems . using this ansatz ,",
    "one obviously neglects the variance of the distribution function .",
    "however , the main features of the resulting macroscopic equation are preserved .",
    "we obtain for the traffic pressure @xmath71    we are left with the enskog term @xmath69 .",
    "it is approximated by considering expression ( [ ens ] ) for @xmath69 and substituting the closure for @xmath16 .",
    "one obtains different expressions depending on the kinetic model under consideration .      in the case of integro - differential equations one obtains @xmath72 with @xmath73   d\\hat{v}_+ d\\hat{v } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 d\\hat{v}_+ d\\hat{v}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using now",
    "@xmath75 gives for @xmath76 approximately : @xmath77      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath78 otherwise .",
    "approximating @xmath79 by @xmath80 this is approximated for @xmath81 by @xmath82 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the acceleration term gives @xmath83   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath84 and @xmath78 otherwise .",
    "therefore one obtains for @xmath85 the approximation @xmath86",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final result depends on the interaction model .",
    "example 1 gives @xmath87 example 2 gives @xmath88      similar results are obtained for the vlasov - fokker - planck equations .",

    "this gives for @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath96 we have @xmath97    in both cases , depending on the interaction law , either a linear dependence on @xmath98 or a nonlinear functional dependence is observed .",
    "altogether , one obtains macroscopic equations either of the form @xmath99 or of the form @xmath100 where the coefficients are given by @xmath101 @xmath102 with suitable functions @xmath103 .",
    "we note that @xmath104 .",
    "looking at these equations one observes that equation ( [ macro ] ) is a rascle - type equation with microscopically justified coefficients which include braking and acceleration threshold . on the other hand , equation ( [ hj ] )",
    "is an equation with hamilton - jacobi terms , which has , to the knowledge of the authors , not been discussed in the literature .",
    "vehicles described by ( [ hj ] ) will brake stronger or accelerate faster , the steeper the gradient in velocity is ahead of them .    if we simplify further",
    ", choosing @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 and approximating @xmath108 by @xmath56 one obtains the coefficients @xmath109    equation ( [ macro ] ) with the coefficient ( [ a ] ) is similar to the modified rascle equation discussed together with its limits in @xcite . from the kinetic point of view",
    "these equations are strongly simplified .",
    "in particular , they treat the braking and acceleration interaction in the same way , which is clearly not physical .",
    "however , they still contain the essential features of traffic flow , see @xcite .",
    "the kind of equation one obtains does not depend on the fact whether an integro - differential equation model or a fokker - planck type model is used , but rather on the fact which interaction rule is chosen .",
    "we note that traffic equations with different hamilton - jacobi terms have also been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the two results obtained here could be also merged into a third equation by using @xmath110 with @xmath111 with a constant @xmath112 .",
    "this would limit the braking force .",
    "equation ( [ macro ] ) with coefficient ( [ a ] ) can be derived from microscopic models of the form @xmath113 this can be easily seen by the following procedure , compare @xcite . set @xmath114",
    "then the microscopic equations are @xmath115 the local ( normalized ) density around vehicle i and its inverse the local ( normalized ) specific volume are respectively defined by @xmath116 one obtains the microscopic model @xmath117 we have @xmath118 one considers the coordinate @xmath119 describing the total space occupied by cars up to point @xmath3 . approximating @xmath120 by @xmath121 yields the lagrangian form of the macroscopic equations ,",
    "i.e. the equivalent of the p - system in gas dynamcis @xmath122 where @xmath123    we change the lagrangian `` mass '' coordinates @xmath124 into eulerian coordinates @xmath125 with @xmath126 or @xmath127 the macroscopic system in eulerian coordinates is then @xmath128 with @xmath129 this means we obtain again the equations ( [ macro ] ) and ( [ a ] ) taking into account that in the kinetic derivation @xmath0 is the number density .",
    "that means the quantity @xmath130 in the kinetic part is equivalent to the normalized density considered in this section .",
    "we note that the above statement is equivalent to considering the kinetic equations for the rescaled distribution functions @xmath131 .",
    "this leads , for example , to a vlasov equation where the braking and acceleration term in ( [ fp ] ) is multiplied by @xmath132 .    for numerical simulations of the microscopic system and comparison with the macroscopic equation",
    "the quantity @xmath133 is chosen such that the total space @xmath134 occupied by the cars is equal to @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the total length of the region under consideration and @xmath137 is the total number of vehicles .    using the same procedure one obtains the microscopic model associated to equation ( [ hj ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath138 the latter equations are similar to microscopic traffic equations originally stated by wiedemann and leutzbach @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the macroscopic equations numerically . in particular , the hamilton - jacobi type equations equation ( [ hj ] ) are compared to the aw - rascle type equations ( [ macro ] ) .",
    "we choose a numerical method suited for the hyperbolic equation in non - conservative form ( [ macro ] ) as well as for the hamilton - jacobi term in ( [ hj ] ) . a suitable choice is given e.g. by second order central scheme developed in @xcite . for completeness we state an extended version of the scheme as used in our numerical computations .",
    "to start with , the above equations are written in the form @xmath139 with @xmath140 for equations ( [ macro ] ) we have @xmath141 and for equations ( [ hj ] ) @xmath142 for the numerical scheme a grid of equally spaced points @xmath143 , with @xmath144 is given . in the following we consider the explicit time step from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "the aim is to construct a second order scheme for the above 1-d equations .",
    "a detailed derivation can be found in @xcite .",
    "based on piecewise quadratic interpolations one obtains the following expression for the iterate @xmath147 approximating @xmath148 ; @xmath149 with the second order approximation of the equation @xmath150 where @xmath151",
    ".    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in these expressions the following definitions are obtained from taylor expansions : @xmath152 and the following approximations of the first @xmath153 and the second derivatives @xmath154\\\\   \\mathcal{d } ( \\delta \\phi)^{m+1}_{i } & = & mm [ ( \\delta \\phi)^{m+1}_{i+1 }   - ( \\delta   \\phi)^{m+1}_{i } ,   \\frac{1}{2 } \\left((\\delta   \\phi)^{m+1}_{i+1 }   - ( \\delta   \\phi)^{m+1}_{i-1 } \\right),\\\\   & &   ( \\delta   \\phi)^{m+1}_{i }   - ( \\delta   \\phi)^{m+1}_{i-1 } ]      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the min - mod function @xmath155 the limiter is used to deal with the possible appearance of discontinuites .    for the above second order scheme a cfl condition has to be fulfilled : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the maximal ( in absolute value ) eigenvector of @xmath158 .",
    "thus , for the hamilton - jacobi model the choice of the time step depends on the values of the gradient @xmath159 and might be very small for very sharp gradients .",
    "this could be avoided by using , for example , equation ( [ merge ] ) .",
    "we note that using the above described second order method for the aw - rascle equations with situations involving contact discontinuities gives , among other problems , quite diffusive results .",
    "this is observed for classical numerical methods for hyperbolic equations as well , see @xcite . for a strategy to compute the contact discontinuities in a more accurate and efficient way we refer to @xcite .      for the numerical simulations we consider the equations ( [ macro ] ) , ( [ hj ] ) with coefficients ( [ a ] ) , ( [ b ] ) respectively and the constants @xmath160 , i.e. @xmath161 .",
    "the behavior of the solutions to the macroscopic equations is investigated in four different test scenarios . to illustrate the performance of the scheme described above the results",
    "are presented with two different mesh sizes @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "all test cases start with riemann problems of the following form : @xmath164 where @xmath165 are given as initial data .",
    "* example 1 : * in the first example the end of a traffic jam is considered .",
    "thereby fast cars approach from the left a group of cars at rest on the right .",
    "the corresponding data is given by @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "for the rascle model the computations are performed in conservative form using the variables @xmath168 to obtain the correct shock speeds .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure [ ex1 ] .",
    "the exact solution of the rascle model ( solid line ) is given by a shock - wave moving to the right followed by a stationary contact - discontinuity , see @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for the hamilton - jacobi model ( dotted line ) show a faster braking of the approaching cars .",
    "this leads to a faster back - traveling wave and a less dense congested state .",
    "about the numerical aspects , the diffusion at the contact discontinuity is reduced by the finer grid , whereas the resolution of the shock in the rascle model ( dashed line ) remains satisfactory .",
    "* example 2 : * now the tail of a group of moving cars followed by an empty road is studied .",
    "the initial states are chosen as @xmath169 with the discontinuity at @xmath167 .",
    "as shown in figure [ ex2 ] , the exact solution of the rascle model ( solid line ) is given by a single contact - discontinuity moving at the speed of the leading cars .",
    "this behavior is captured well by the numerical scheme ( dashed line ) and holds also true for the hamilton - jacobi model . in both cases",
    "the cars are not influenced by the free space behind them and are thus following the constant state in front .",
    "* example 3 : * here we consider a group of faster vehicles escaping from slower ones in behind .",
    "therefore we chose @xmath170 on the left and right of @xmath167 . in figure [ ex3 ]",
    "the corresponding solutions are plotted .",
    "the exact solution of the rascle model ( solid line ) consists of a left going rarefaction wave and a contact - discontinuity moving to the right .",
    "as the drivers of the hamilton jacobi model ( dotted line ) tend to accelerate faster than those of the rascle model ( dashed line ) , the arising gap is less distinct .",
    "thus a more homogeneous state is reached on the left . by increasing the number of grid points only the resolution of the contact discontinuity",
    "is improved .",
    "* example 4 : * finally we consider an example similar to the above one , but now with faster cars on the right .",
    "the data is given as @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the exact solution of the rascle model ( solid line , figure [ ex4 ] ) is given by a rarefaction wave connected to a vacuum state , which is followed by a contact - discontinuity moving to the right . here",
    "a difference to the numerical solution ( dashed line ) is observed .",
    "the applied scheme fails to properly capture the fake wave connecting the rarefaction wave to the vacuum state .",
    "the artificial jump can not be reduced by an increase of the computational accuracy . in the hamilton jacobi model ( dotted line )",
    "no such vacuum state arises , since the drivers tend to accelerate faster .    in the above",
    "examples the wave fronts for the hamilton - jacobi model are smeared compared to the aw - rascle model as expected .",
    "in particular , example 1 shows a stronger breaking for the hamilton - jacobi model and example 3 shows a faster acceleration of the vehicles keeping contact with the leading cars .",
    "one also observes comparing the coarse and fine grid numerical solution , that the hamilton - jacobi equations are already well approximated by the coarse grid solution .",
    "only example 4 shows a further steepening of the solution by refining the mesh . in general ,",
    "the rascle type conservation law is well approximated by the scheme except some smearing of the contact discontinuities .",
    "the only exception is the vacuum wave in example 4 , where a non - physical jump is generated .",
    "numerical difficulties at vacuum states are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the numerical solution of the hyperbolic aw - rascle model is sensitive to the choice of variables .",
    "example 1 ( a solution with a shock ) is computed using conservative variables @xmath173 to ensure the correct intermediate state .",
    "example 2,3,4 have been computed in @xmath174 variables , since no shocks appear .",
    "although this choice of variables improves the resolution of the contact discontinuity it remains rather diffusive . as mentioned above using the methods described in @xcite a sharp resolution of the contact discontinuities can be obtained .",
    "nevertheless , we plotted in the above figures for comparison the solutions using the scheme described in section 5.1 .",
    "* the paper contains the derivation of two classes of macroscopic models from kinetic equations .",
    "the type of equation one obtains does not depend on the fact whether an integro - differential equation or a fokker - planck type model is used , but rather on the fact which interaction rule is chosen . * in certain cases a hamilton - jacobi term can be derived in the momentum equations instead of the classical rascle term .",
    "* numerical investigation using a suitable second order method have been used to investigate the behavior of the solutions showing a smearing effect of the wave fronts for the hamilton - jacobi equations .",
