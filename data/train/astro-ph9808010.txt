    "in recent years inclusion of elemental diffusion has been an essential ingredient of stellar evolutionary codes for achieving agreement between predicted and helioseismic values of properties of the convective envelope , see e.g. cox et al.(1989 ) , bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) , bahcall et al .",

    "the success of solar models with diffusion , and the corresponding failures of models that neglect diffusion , suggest that the diffusion process has been properly treated .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a quantitative estimate of the accuracy of the calculated diffusion coefficients , by comparing predictions of solar models with observational data provided by helioseismology .    until recently , few stellar evolution codes included diffusion .",
    "apart from practical difficulties , the omission of diffusion was justified since elemental diffusion occurs on a large time scale ( larger than @xmath1 yr . to diffuse a solar radius under solar condition ) , which should imply that the effect on stellar structure are small .",
    "nevertheless , the precision required for calculating solar neutrino fluxes and for matching the accuracy of helioseismic observations is so great that diffusion has to be taken into account , see e.g. bahcall & loeb ( 1990 ) , proffit ( 1994 ) .",
    "most importantly , diffusion together with gravitational settling hide below the convective envelope a significant fraction ( about 10% ) of the initial helium and heavy metals , and this effect is crucial when comparing solar models with the observed properties of the convective envelope ( e.g.the present heavy element abundance and helium fraction , this latter inferred by means of helioseismology ) .",
    "one of the most detailed calculations of diffusion coefficients has been presented by thoul et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , hereafter tbl .",
    "it is based upon exact numerical solutions of the fundamental equations for element diffusion and heat transfer discussed in burgers ( 1969 ) .",
    "good agreement exists between the diffusion rates computed by thoul et al . and the results obtained with a very different treatment of michaud & proffit ( 1993 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the tbl coefficients is estimated to be about 15% by comparison with the results of other authors , see bhacall and pinsonneault ( 1995 ) and refs . therein .",
    "however , some warning is needed : the separation of elements by diffusion might be inhibited by the presence of mixing in the solar interior , see schatzman ( 1969 ) , lebreton & maeder ( 1987 ) , pinsonneault et al .",

    "we also remind the anomalous lithium depletion of the sun with respect to meteorites , signalling some deficiency of present standard solar models .",
    "clearly quantitative observational constraints on the calculated diffusion coefficients would be welcome .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the constraints posed by helioseismology .",
    "as previously remarked recent standard solar models ( ssms ) which include diffusion , as well as accurate equations of state and updated opacity tables , are in good agreement with helioseismology .",
    "in essence we address the following question : _ which variation of the diffusion efficiency is allowed without spoling the agreement with helioseismic data ? _    in the next section we study how the predictions of solar models are affected when the diffusion efficiency is changed and we summarize the relevant helioseismic information .    in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss the comparison of helioseismic data with the predictions of solar models , when the diffusion efficiency is varied .",
    "for our standard solar model calculations we use the diffusion coefficients calculated following tbl . for each element one has to consider three different coefficients ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 following the notation of tbl ) , each depending on the value of several chemical and physical variables ( @xmath4 ) in the solar interior , so that in principle one has really many parameters which could be varied for numerical studies .",
    "all the diffusion coefficients , however , are approximately constant along the solar profile apart from the innermost core , see fig .",
    "11 in tbl .    for simplicity",
    ", we shall introduce just one _ diffusion efficiency parameter _ @xmath5 and we shall study solar models obtained by rescaling the tbl coefficients by the factor @xmath5 , assumed to be the same for all elements at any point in the solar interior .    by numerical experiments with our evolutionary code franec ( cieffi & straniero ( 1988 ) )",
    "we have determined solar models ( i.e. stellar structures with luminosity @xmath6erg / s , radius @xmath7 cm and photospheric abundance @xmath8 at age @xmath9 gy for a mass @xmath10 g ) obtained for different values of @xmath5 .    by means of helioseismology",
    "one can reconstruct accurately three independent properties of the convective envelope : its depth @xmath11 , its density at the bottom @xmath12 and the photospheric helium abundance @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting values together with estimated @xmath14 uncertainties are shown in table [ tabhelios ] together with ssm predictions from the model with helium and heavy element diffusion of bahcall and pinsonneault ( 1995 ) hereafter bp95 .    .",

    "( 1998 ) ) , whereas a @xmath14 estimate has been provided in kamionkowski & bahcall ( 1994 ) ; we shall use @xmath21 at @xmath14 ( 5% is the `` @xmath22 error '' estimate ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath20 has been determined numerically in deglinnocenti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . by redefining a suitable @xmath23 : @xmath24 we find now : @xmath25      the heavy element abundance @xmath27 and the solar opacity @xmath26 are known with a conservative accuracy of about @xmath28% , see bahcall & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) , v. castellani et al .",
    "therefore , our @xmath14 relative error estimate will be @xmath29 .",

    ", we consider one of the standard solar models ( models that include all the state - of - the - art solar physics ) , whose helioseismic properties differ the most from bp95 and , consequently , fit less well the experimental data . we repeated the above - described analysis by using fr97 ( ciacio et al .",
