    "higher - dimensional gravity appears in the landscape of modern physics as a result of the string theory or in various brane - world models . both ,",
    "string theory and brane - world contexts imply the existence of higher dimensional black holes . for the four dimensional gravity",
    ", there exists a uniqueness theorem that states that the asymptotically flat stationary black hole is described by the well - known kerr solution . in higher dimensions ,",
    "such a uniqueness theorem does not hold any more , but a great variety of solutions describing black objects , such as black holes , strings , branes , rings , saturns , exist instead @xcite .",
    "therefore , the stability of rotating black holes in higher than four space - time dimensions is an open appealing problem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "stability could help to select among the variety of `` black '' solutions those which could be realized in nature .",
    "another motivation to study the evolution of higher - dimensional black hole perturbations comes from the possibility to observe mini - black holes in future experiments with cosmic showers or in the large hadron collider @xcite .",
    "the stability of spherically symmetric static black holes has been intensively studied in recent few years .",
    "it started from the papers by ishibashi and kodama @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , who , using the gauge - invariant formalism , proved that the d - dimensional generalization of the schwarzschild black hole , described by the tangherlini metric , is stable .",
    "then , the stability of higher - dimensional black holes allowing for a cosmological constant was shown in @xcite for @xmath1 schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) and in @xcite for @xmath1 reissner - nordstrm - anti - de sitter ( rnads ) black holes .",
    "the d - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole was shown to be stable , although reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes proved to be unstable in higher than six space - time dimensions @xcite , when both the charge and @xmath2- term are large enough .",
    "the stability of black holes in higher dimensional generalizations of the einstein gravity , such as the gauss - bonnet and lovelock theories , was considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and an instability for large values of the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath3 was found .",
    "this gauss - bonnet instability was shown to have quite peculiar behavior : the instability starts dominating after a long period of damped quasinormal oscillations .",
    "in addition , the stability analysis and time domain evolution of perturbations were considered for the kaluza - klein type solutions , such as ( squashed ) kaluza - klein black holes @xcite or black strings @xcite .",
    "while the stability of static black holes in higher dimensions is relatively well studied , the stability of rotating black holes for @xmath4 is still an open question , because the separation of variables for all types of perturbations is a complicated problem .",
    "nevertheless , some particular results have been obtained for the myers - perry black holes with all equal angular momenta , though only for either tensor - type perturbations @xcite or for the so - called zero mode @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have started the investigation of gravitational perturbations of a much more interesting type of higher - dimensional rotating black holes , simply rotating black holes .",
    "these black holes have only one non - vanishing angular momentum component and are rotating in a single two - plane .",
    "thus , they can be interpreted in brane - world scenarios as black holes created in particle collisions occurred on our brane .",
    "the perturbation equations for the @xmath5 dimensional simply rotating black holes , allowing for a cosmological constant , were reduced in @xcite to the wave - like form , and gravitational spectrum of asymptotically - ads solutions was considered .",
    "the asymptotically ads rotating black holes proved to be gravitationally unstable on superradiant modes only , and with a tiny instability growth rate @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall continue research that started in @xcite and consider tensor - type gravitational spectrum of asymptotically flat , myers - perry black holes .",
    "the quasinormal modes beside their importance for stability proof , may have useful implications for the study of the evolution of mini higher - dimensional black holes , because quasinormal modes dominate at late time of the bolding phase @xcite of an evaporating black hole .    using the frobenius method for the angular part of the perturbation equations and both wkb and frobenius methods for the radial part",
    ", we have found the quasinormal modes of simply - rotating myers - perry black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii gives basic information on simply - rotating mp black holes .",
    "iii is devoted to description of the numerical methods that we used for finding the quasinormal modes .",
    "iv discusses the obtained numerical results .",
    "the metric for the higher - dimensional myers - perry black hole can be written in the boyer - lindquist coordinates as where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the metric of the @xmath8-dimensional unit sphere , and here @xmath9 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath10 is the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "the equations for the tensor - type gravitational perturbations of this black hole are reduced to the coupled equations @xcite for the angular part @xmath11 @xmath12 and for the radial part @xmath13 @xmath14 with respect to the frequency @xmath15 and the separation constant @xmath16 . here , we have defined the tortoise coordinate @xmath17 as @xmath18",
    "the differential equation for the angular part ( [ angular - part ] ) can be solved numerically in the same way as it was done in @xcite .",
    "namely , the second - order differential equation ( [ angular - part ] ) is reduced to an algebraic equation with an infinite continued fraction @xcite .",
    "this equation can be solved numerically to determine the separation constant @xmath16 for each value of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we can find numerically the function @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an integer number .",
    "the number @xmath21 enumerates the eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "if the black hole does not rotate ( @xmath22 ) , the equation for the angular part can be solved exactly to yield @xcite @xmath23 which coincides with the eigenvalue for the harmonic function on the unit @xmath24-sphere , with the multi - pole number @xmath25 .",
    "if the rotation parameter @xmath10 is non - vanishing , the eigenvalues @xmath16 are non - integer and complex . for any value of @xmath15 , we can enumerate them by the non - negative integer @xmath21 in the following way .    1 .",
    "we start from the non - rotating black hole and find exactly the value of @xmath16 for the corresponding @xmath21 .",
    "we increase the rotation parameter by a very small value and search for the closest to the previously found solution for @xmath16 .",
    "we repeat the previous step until any required value of @xmath10 is reached .    in this way we are able to enumerate the values of the separation constant @xmath16 for any @xmath15 and @xmath10 . in order to decrease the computation time , in practice ,",
    "when searching for quasi - normal modes , we start from the known values of the quasi - normal frequencies for a non - rotating black hole @xcite and , increasing step by step the value of @xmath10 , find the closest pair of @xmath16 and @xmath15 to the previously found one .",
    "an alternative approach for the computation of the angular separation constant has been recently suggested in @xcite .      in order to simplify our notations",
    ", we will parameterise the black hole mass by the black hole horizon radius @xmath26 : @xmath27 in solving the radial part of the perturbation equation , we use two alternative approaches : the numerical frobenius method @xcite and the semi - analytical jwkb approximation @xcite .",
    "let us start from the description of the frobenius method .",
    "we are searching for the solution of the equation ( [ wave - like - flat ] ) with the quasi - normal boundary conditions that requires pure in - coming waves at the event horizon and pure out - going waves at spatial infinity .",
    "for a black hole in the asymptotically flat background , they imply a purely ingoing wave at the event horizon @xmath26 and purely outgoing wave at the spatial infinity .",
    "if @xmath28 satisfies the quasi - normal boundary conditions , then it can be written in the following form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a regular function at the event horizon @xmath31 and at the spatial infinity @xmath32 .    in order to expand @xmath30 in the convergent series in the region outside the event horizon",
    ", we choose the variable @xmath33 where @xmath34 is chosen so that all the singular points of the equation ( [ wave - like - flat ] ) , except the event horizon and the spatial infinity , are located outside the unit circle @xmath35 .",
    "these singular points satisfy the equation @xmath36 fortunately , the structure of the singular points allows us to fix @xmath37 for a physically reasonable range of parameters .",
    "after the value of @xmath37 is fixed , we expand the function @xmath38 into the series @xmath39 substituting ( [ frobenius_series ] ) and ( [ singularities_expand ] ) into ( [ wave - like - flat ] ) , we find the recurrence relation for the series coefficients @xmath40 .",
    "following @xcite , we are able to find the equation with an infinite continued fraction with respect to @xmath15 , which can be solved numerically .",
    "the frobenius method , being based on a convergent procedure , allows us to find quasinormal modes ( qnms ) with any required accuracy , at least theoretically .",
    "practically , for some range of parameters ( in particularly for large azimuthal numbers ) the convergence is too slow and the calculation can not be easily done by a personal computer . in the range of parameters of slow frobenius convergence",
    ", we use the wkb approximation @xcite . the wkb formula ( [ wkbformula ] )",
    "was effectively used in a lot of papers @xcite , and here the wkb accuracy will be checked with the help of the the frobenius method .",
    "the 6-th order wkb formula reads @xmath41 where the correction terms @xmath42 were obtained in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 denote values of @xmath45 and its second derivative at its maximum with respect to the tortoise coordinate @xmath17 , respectively . since the function @xmath46 is found only numerically , in order to find the roots of ( [ wkbformula ] ) , we use the following algorithm :    1 .   for a given value of @xmath15 , we find the value of @xmath16 using the technique described in the section [ sec : angular - part ] .",
    "we substitute the numerical values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 into ( [ wkbpot ] ) and find @xmath45 as a complex analytical function of @xmath47 .",
    "the analytical continuation of the wkb formula into the complex plane implies that `` maximum '' of the potential peak is a complex value , which must be correctly chosen among the extrema of the potential @xmath45 . since the wkb formula provides a sufficient accuracy only when @xmath48 , we will not consider the case , when the imaginary part of the quasi - normal frequency is large .",
    "fortunately , when the imaginary part of @xmath15 is small , the imaginary part of @xmath16 is just a correction to its real part .",
    "therefore , the real part of @xmath49 is much larger than its imaginary part , and the analytical continuation of the potential peak is trivial .",
    "we choose the location @xmath50 of the extremum of @xmath49 , with a real part that is larger than the value of the event horizon and , at the same time , has the smallest imaginary part .",
    "this choice of the potential peak does not lead to any ambiguities for the considered parametric range , is close to the real potential peak for the non - rotating case and its searching can be easily programmed .",
    "after the potential peak is fixed , we compare the frequency @xmath51 found with the formula ( [ wkbformula ] ) with our initial guess @xmath15 .",
    "we search for the numerical minimum of the absolute value of the difference between the initial guess and the wkb formula @xmath52 , which is a function that can be calculated numerically using the above technique .",
    "when we write the quasinormal frequency @xmath15 as @xmath53 @xmath54 corresponds to an unstable ( growing ) mode , and @xmath55 corresponds to a stable ( damped ) mode .",
    "the quasinormal modes of a higher - dimensional simply rotating black hole are labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath21 , and also depend on the black hole parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 as well as on the number of space - time dimensions @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the dependence of the spectrum on the above six parameters must be carefully considered in order to discard or observe instability .",
    "we have limited the calculations to @xmath59 and @xmath60 . keeping the event horizon radius",
    "@xmath26 fixed , we can measure the qn frequencies in units @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the dependence of the quasinormal behavior on the four essential parameters must be studied .",
    "as all of them @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath21 , @xmath10 are not limited , in principle , we have to check the qn frequency as a function of each parameter starting from its minimal value and until reaching _ the asymptotic region _ where the frequency function does not change its behavior qualitatively .",
    "however , this task would require us to show here hundreds of plots and would take enormous computer time .",
    "therefore , we were obliged to adopt the following practical strategy .",
    "if the frequency @xmath15 as a function of some parameter does not show any tendency to instability and the lowest ( longest lived ) modes stay very far from the instability region , we stopped the calculation at some reasonable value of the parameter . strictly speaking ,",
    "this does not allow us to establish mathematically rigorous proof of stability , but rather only give a numerical evidence of stability . in presenting the obtained results , in order to reduce the number of plots , we selected most representative ones with qualitatively different behavior .",
    "if plots are similar ( for instance for various @xmath58 and the same other parameters ) we have shown only one representative plot of the whole `` class '' .",
    "comparison of the accurate data obtained by the frobenius method with the wkb values shows that the wkb approximation becomes better as the azimuthal number @xmath57 becomes larger , because it corresponds to larger values of the real part of the qn frequency .",
    "indeed , the wkb approximation works when @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the limit of perfect wkb accuracy , which corresponds to the geometric optics approximation , should be achieved at @xmath63 .",
    "figures [ fig : d7_apm ] , [ fig : d7_anm ] and [ fig : d11_a ] show the dependence of the quasinormal frequency , obtained by the frobenius method , on the rotation parameter a for a few low values of m and the lowest values of @xmath64 and @xmath21 .",
    "qnms for a few low values of @xmath64 and @xmath21 can be found in figure [ fig : d7a ] .",
    "there , one can see that @xmath65 almost monotonically decreases ( except for a small peak at very small @xmath10 ) , when @xmath10 is increased , while @xmath66 is growing until reaching its maximum , and then falling off to some asymptotic constant value . as the absolute value of @xmath66 decreases",
    "when @xmath57 increases , it is important to find qnms for sufficiently large @xmath57 , in order to rule out the instability . on figures fig .",
    "[ fig : d7a10 ] one can see the high @xmath57 behavior for a fixed @xmath10 and @xmath58 .",
    "apparently @xmath65 is equidistant in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath66 approaches some maximum and then starts to fall off at large @xmath57 , reaching some constant value asymptotically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d7a10 ] ) .    in the figure [ fig : d7_anm ]",
    "one can see that for large negative @xmath57 the maximum of the imaginary part is higher ( closer to zero ) and occurs for larger value of the rotation parameter @xmath10 .",
    "one might ask himself if there is sufficiently high value of @xmath57 for which the imaginary part crosses zero at some point leading to the instability for larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "our calculations show that this does not take place . in the left figure [ fig : d7_fit ]",
    "we plot the dependence of the maximum value of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 in the logarithmic - logarithmic scale .",
    "we see that this value is well approximated by the potential law @xmath69 .",
    "if this is valid for the asymptotically large values of @xmath57 , the maximum of the imaginary part of the quasi - normal frequency approaches zero only asymptotically .",
    "the corresponding value of the rotation parameter depends linearly on @xmath57 and , therefore , also approaches infinity ( see the right figure [ fig : d7_fit ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that at least for the finite rotation parameter all modes of negative @xmath57 are stable .",
    "in figures [ fig : d8 ] , [ fig : d9 ] , [ fig : d11 ] , [ fig : a7m1 ] the dependence of qnms on @xmath21 is shown . there",
    ", one can see that the qn spectrum stays well far from the instability point .",
    "thus , we conclude that no growing mode was found for simply rotating myers - perry black holes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , i.e. tensor - type gravitational perturbations are stable in the above cases .",
    "we have investigated the stability of simply rotating myers - perry black holes with @xmath70 against tensor - type gravitational perturbations .",
    "we have not found a growing mode , which apparently signifies stability against tensor perturbations .",
    "let us note that the quasinormal spectrum of a simply rotating myers - perry black hole is not a limit of that of a mp black hole in the ads spacetime , when the ads radius @xmath71 approaches infinity . from the equation ( 71 ) of @xcite , one can see , that when @xmath72 the quasinormal modes approach zero as @xmath73      h. k. was supported in part by grants - in - aid for scientific research from jsps ( no .",
