    "the glashow - weinberg - salam @xcite theory of electroweak interactions , which combined with the quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) is now called the standard model ( sm ) , is one of the greatest achievements of particle physics in the 20@xmath0 century . among others , the glashow - weinberg - salam theory allowed to predict successfully the existence of charmed - particles @xcite , of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , a new class of weak interactions ( neutral currents ) , the existence of the vector @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons and their masses .",
    "all the predictions of the sm have been confirmed by numerous experiments ; the theory describes beautifully all the existing experimental data in the whole energy range available at present ( except for the indications in favor of neutrino oscillations that we will discuss in the following ) .    however , the prevailing general consensus is that the sm can not be the final theory of elementary particles .",
    "the sm is a theory of weak , electromagnetic and strong interactions with the exception of gravity . in this theory ,",
    "more than 20 arbitrary fundamental parameters ( masses of quarks and leptons , coupling constants , mixing angles , etc . ) still remain to be explained .",
    "also , there are several conceptual problems ; to name only two , the lack of any explanation of why in nature there exist three generations of quarks and leptons that differ only in masses and the hierarchy problem , connected with the radiative corrections to the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "major efforts at the moment are directed towards the search for a theory of elementary particles that could generalize the sm and would solve the problems mentioned above . in the past , many such models have been proposed .",
    "they include , among others , grand unified models , supersymmetric models , superstring models , composite models @xcite . in many experiments , possible effects of physics beyond the standard model",
    "have been and will be searched for . in the frontier of accelerator high energy experiments ,",
    "one of the major goals is to find , as a signature of new physics , supersymmetric particles or some unexpected behavior of the standard higgs boson . among accelerator and non - accelerator physics experiments ,",
    "one of the most popular searches have been that of neutrino masses via neutrino oscillations , for most theories beyond the sm predict non - zero neutrino masses , and that of proton decay . at present",
    "some evidence on new physics beyond the sm has been found only in neutrino oscillation experiments .    if neutrinos are massive and mixed , the states of _ flavor neutrinos _",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are mixed coherent superpositions of the states of neutrinos with definite mass . in this case , neutrinos produced via weak interactions experience _ neutrino oscillations _ , which are periodical transitions among different flavor neutrinos .",
    "such effects appear to have been observed in several neutrino experiments .",
    "an impressive evidence for the disappearance of atmospheric @xmath8 s has been presented by the super - kamiokande collaboration .",
    "similar indications in favor of neutrino oscillations have also been obtained in the kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , soudan 2 @xcite and macro @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "all the existing data of solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite ) can naturally be explained by neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "finally , some indication in favor of @xmath9 and @xmath10 oscillations has been found in the accelerator lsnd experiment @xcite .    these data constitute _ the first observation of processes in which lepton numbers are not conserved_. it is a general belief that such phenomena are due to physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to review the theory and phenomenology of neutrino masses , neutrino mixing and the salient features of neutrino oscillations . in section  [ two - component neutrino , standard model and lepton numbers ] , a short discussion of the theory of two - component neutrinos",
    ", the standard model and the law of conservation of lepton numbers will be given . in section  [ neutrino mass and mixings ] , we will consider the problem of neutrino mass and different possibilities of neutrino mixing .",
    "neutrino oscillations will be discussed in section  [ neutrino oscillations ] and the experimental data will be briefly presented and discussed in section  [ status of neutrino oscillations ] .",

    "the detection is based on the observation of radioactive @xmath51ge atoms produced in the reaction @xmath52 whose threshold is @xmath53 .",
    "the event rates observed in the gallex and sage experiments are about 1/2 of the predicted rates ( see table  [ solar ] ) .    in the underground kamiokande @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite water - cherenkov experiments ,",
    "the solar neutrinos are detected in real time through the observation of the recoil electron in the process @xmath54 most importantly , in these experiments _ the direction of neutrinos can be determined _ through the the measurement of the direction of the recoil electrons . because of the low energy background from natural radioactivity , the thresholds in the kamiokande and super - kamiokande experiments are rather high : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , in these experiments only @xmath57b neutrinos are detected .",
    "the results of the kamiokande and super - kamiokande experiments are presented in table  [ solar ] . as it can be seen from this table ,",
    "the @xmath57b neutrino flux observed in these experiments is significantly smaller ( about 1/2 ) than the ssm prediction .",
    "thus , in all the solar neutrino experiments a _ deficit of solar @xmath5 s is observed_. this deficit constitutes the solar neutrino problem .",

    "the model takes into account all the existing data on nuclear cross sections , opacities , etc . and",
    "is in impressive agreement with precise helioseismological data .",
    "it is a consensus that the solar neutrino problem should be attributed to _",
    "neutrino properties_.    let us first discuss some model - independent conclusions that can be inferred from the solar neutrino data . in the gallium experiments , neutrinos from all the solar sources are detected . from the luminosity constraint ( [ luminosity ] ) , we have the following lower bound for the event rate in the gallium experiments : @xmath58 the data of the gallex and sage experiments are compatible with this bound ( see the table  [ solar ] ) .",
    "thus , on the basis of the luminosity constraint alone , one can not conclude that the solar neutrino problem exists .",
    "however , we can see that the problem exists if we _ compare _ the data obtained from different solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "let us assume that @xmath59 and let us consider the total neutrino fluxes @xmath60 as free variable parameters . from the data of the super - kamiokande experiment it follows that the flux of @xmath57b neutrinos is @xmath61",
    "if we subtract the contribution of @xmath57b neutrinos from the event rate observed in the homestake experiment , we obtain an upper bound for the contribution of @xmath62be neutrinos to the chlorine event rate : @xmath63 according to the ssm , the contribution of @xmath62be neutrinos to the chlorine event rate is significantly larger ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "such a strong suppression of the flux of @xmath62be neutrinos can not be explained by any known astrophysical mechanism @xcite .",
    "one can reach the same conclusion using the super - kamiokande and gallex - sage data .",
    "the solar neutrinos problem can be solved if we assume that the solar @xmath5 s transform into another flavor ( @xmath8 , @xmath47 ) or sterile states through neutrino oscillations . in order to explain all the existing solar neutrino data , it is sufficient to assume that transitions between two neutrino states alone take place .",
    "the solar neutrinos produced in the thermonuclear reactions in the central zone of the sun pass through a large amount of matter on the way to the earth .",
    "if the value of the parameter @xmath65 lies between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , coherent matter effects become important and the transition probability of solar @xmath5 s into other states can be resonantly enhanced ( msw effect @xcite ) , even for small values of the mixing angle @xmath68 . assuming the validity of the ssm and that the msw effects does indeed take place , the analysis of all the solar neutrino data leads to the following two possible sets of best - fit values of the oscillation parameters @xcite @xmath69 in the case of @xmath70 transitions only small values of the mixing angle are allowed @xcite .",
    "the existing data can also be explained if @xmath71 and matter effects are unimportant . in this case ,",
    "the @xmath5 survival probability is given by the standard two neutrino vacuum expression ( see eq.([surv1 ] ) ) . from the analysis of the data , the following best - fit values of the oscillation parameters",

    "recently a new solar neutrino experiment , sno @xcite , started in canada . in this experiment",
    ", the solar @xmath57b neutrinos will be detected through the charged current ( cc ) process , @xmath73 , the neutral current ( nc ) process , @xmath74 , and elastic neutrino - electron scattering @xmath75 .    from the detection of the solar neutrinos via the cc process , the spectrum of @xmath5 s on the earth can be measured and compared with the well - known @xmath57b neutrino spectrum predicted by the theory of weak interactions .",
    "a comparison of the measured spectrum with the predicted one can provide us with a model - independent check on whether the solar @xmath5 s have transformed into other states in a energy - dependent wayb neutrino spectrum is under investigation also in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite . ] .",
    "the detection of neutrinos via the nc process can determine the total flux of all flavors , @xmath5 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the comparison of the nc and cc measurements , will provide us with another possibility to check in a model - independent way whether transitions of the solar @xmath5 s into other flavor states actually take place .    from all the analyses of the solar neutrino data",
    "it follows that the flux of medium energy @xmath62be neutrinos is strongly suppressed .",
    "a future solar neutrino experiment , borexino @xcite , in which mainly @xmath62be neutrinos will be detected , can check this general conclusion obtained from the existing data .",
    "several other future solar neutrino experiments @xcite ( icarus , gno , lens , hellaz and others ) are under planning or development . in these experiments",
    "different parts of the solar neutrino spectrum will be explored in detail .    a sensitivity to values of @xmath65 as small as @xmath78",
    "will be reached in the lbl reactor experiments kam - land in japan @xcite and borexino in italy @xcite ( with distances between reactors and detectors of about 200 km and 800 km , respectively ) .",
    "these experiments will be able to check the large mixing angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the third indication in favor of neutrino oscillations was reported by the los alamos neutrino experiment lsnd @xcite . in this experiment , neutrinos were produced in decays at rest of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "thus , there are no @xmath83 s from the source . at a distance of about 30 m from the source",
    "@xmath83 s are searched for in the large lsnd detector ( about 180 tons of liquid scintillator ) via the process @xmath84 a significant number of @xmath83 events ( 22 events with an expected background of @xmath85 events ) has been found in the range of neutrino energy @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the observed events can be explained by @xmath87 oscillations .",
    "taking into account the results of other reactor and accelerator experiments , in which neutrino oscillations were not observed , the following ranges for the oscillation parameters are allowed : @xmath88    the lsnd collaboration found also some evidence in favor of @xmath10 transitions of the @xmath8 s generated by @xmath79 decay in flight @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 s produced in this way can be distinguished from the @xmath5 s generated by @xmath81 decay at rest because they have higher energies .",
    "the resulting allowed values of the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath89 are compatible with those in eq.([lsndrange ] ) .    in another accelerator experiment , karmen @xcite , designed to find @xmath87 oscillations , no positive signal was found .",
    "the sensitivity of the karmen experiment to the value of the parameter @xmath90 is , however , smaller than the sensitivity of the lsnd experiment and at the moment there is no contradiction between the results of these two experiments , although part of the lsnd allowed region is disfavored by the results of the karmen experiment .",
    "new experiments are needed in order to investigate in detail the lsnd anomaly .",
    "four such experiments have been proposed and are under study : boone @xcite at fermilab , i-216 @xcite at cern , orland @xcite at oak ridge and ness at the european spallation source @xcite . among these proposals boone is approved and will start in the year 2001 .    in summary , indications in favor of nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing have been found in the atmospheric , solar and lsnd neutrino experiments .",
    "what conclusions can we drawn about the possible neutrino mass spectra and the values of the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath91 from the data of these experiments ?",
    "assuming the validity of the solar and atmospheric indications in favor of neutrino oscillations , the types of neutrino mass spectra allowed by the data crucially depend on the validity of the lsnd result . if this result fails to be confirmed by future experiments , three massive neutrinos with the hierarchical mass spectrum of see - saw type and with @xmath92 relevant for the oscillations of solar neutrinos and @xmath93 relevant for the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are enough to describe all the existing data @xcite .",
    "the chooz and super - kamiokande results suggest that , in the three neutrino case , the element @xmath94 is small @xcite .",
    "this means that the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos are practically decoupled and are described by the two - neutrino formalism .",
    "neutrinos are very light in this scenario : the heaviest mass is @xmath95 . in order to answer the fundamental question as to whether massive neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles",
    ", it is necessary to increase the sensitivity of the experiments searching for neutrinoless double-@xmath96 decay by at least one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "if the lsnd result is confirmed , at least three different scales of @xmath65 ( lsnd , atmospheric and solar ) are needed in order to describe the data , which implies that there are at least four massive ( but light ) neutrinos . in the minimal scheme with four massive neutrinos , only the two mass spectra @xmath97 with two couples of close masses separated by the the `` lsnd gap '' of about 1 ev , are compatible with all the existing data @xcite .",
    "the existence of four massive light neutrinos implies that a sterile neutrino should exist in addition to the flavor neutrinos @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , if the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis constraint on the number of light neutrinos @xcite is less than 4 @xcite , there is a stringent limit on the mixing of the sterile neutrino with the two massive neutrinos that are responsible for the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos and the two allowed schemes have the form shown in fig .",
    "[ schemesab ] @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath98 is mainly mixed with the two massive neutrinos that contribute to solar neutrino oscillations ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 in scheme a and @xmath101 and @xmath102 in scheme b ) and @xmath47 is mainly mixed with the two massive neutrinos that contribute to the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos .    in the extended sm with massive neutrinos , there is no room for sterile neutrinos .",
    "thus , a successful explanation of _ all _ the existing data requires new exciting physics .",
    "the two types of neutrino mass spectra that can accommodate the solar , atmospheric and lsnd scales of @xmath65 and the mixing schemes that emerge if the big - bang nucleosynthesis constraint on the number of light neutrinos is less than 4 . ]",
    "the evidence in favor of oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos found in the super - kamiokande experiment and the indications in favor of oscillations obtained in other atmospheric neutrino experiments , in the solar neutrino experiments and in the lsnd experiment has opened a new chapter in neutrino physics : _ the physics of massive and mixed neutrinos_.      we are now anxiously waiting for the results of the new neutrino oscillation experiments sno and k2k , that started their operation in 1999 , and the future experiments borexino , icarus , boone , minos and many others , that will start after the year 2001 .",
    "we hope that the results of these experiments will answer the questions that have been puzzling us for the past decades .",
    "there is no doubt that the program of future investigations of neutrino oscillations will lead to a significant progress in understanding _ the origin of the tiny neutrino masses and of neutrino mixing _ , which is undoubtedly of extreme importance for the future of elementary particle physics and astrophysics",
