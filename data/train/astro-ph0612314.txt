    ". however , deep radio surveys at 1.4ghz show an upturn in the integrated source counts at sub - mjy levels revealing the presence of a population of faint radio sources far in excess of those expected from the high luminosity radio galaxies and quasars which dominate at higher fluxes @xcite . while radio sources with relatively bright optical counterparts are starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recent detailed multi - wavelength follow - up of faint radio sources showed a mixture of active star forming galaxies and agn hosts @xcite .",
    "the exact mixture of these different populations ( high - z agn out to the highest redshifts , intermediate - z post starburst , and lower - z emission line galaxies ) as a function of radio flux level is not very well established , especially in the @xmath7jy regime .    in order to fully investigate the nature and evolution of the @xmath7jy population it is necessary to couple deep radio observations with high quality imaging and spectroscopic data from other wavelengths covering as much of the electromagnetic spectrum as possible .",
    "the international cosmos ( cosmic evolution ) survey @xcitecosmos ] provides such a unique opportunity .",

    "these make the cosmos field an excellent resource for observational cosmology and galaxy evolution in the important redshift range @xmath9 , a time span covering @xmath1075% of the lifetime of the universe .",
    "one major scientific rationale of the cosmos survey is to study the relation between the large scale structure ( lss ) and the evolution of galaxies and smbhs . in a @xmath11cdm cosmology ,",
    "galaxies in the early universe grow through two major processes : dissipational collapse and merging of lower mass protogalactic and galactic components .",
    "their intrinsic evolution is then driven by the conversion of primordial and interstellar gas into stars , with galactic merging and interactions triggering star formation and starbursts .",
    "mergers also can perturb the gravitational potential in the vicinity of the black hole , thus initiating or enhancing agn activity .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that galaxy evolution and black hole growth are closely connected ; cosmos offers the chance to observe this connection directly .",
    "while there is general agreement over this qualitative picture , the timing / occurrence of these events and their dependence on the local environment remains to be observationally explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to study lss it is essential to obtain high spatial resolution data over the entire electromagnetic spectrum covering a significant area on the sky , like 2deg@xmath12 as in the case of the cosmos survey . also , surveys of active galactic nuclei benefit from such a combination of areal coverage and depth .",
    "for the radio observations at 1.4ghz , it was essential to match the typical resolution for optical - nir ground - based data of @xmath10 1@xmath2 to fully exploit the cosmos database .",
    "therefore observations with the nrao very large array ( vla ) had to be conducted in the a - array that provides a resolution of about 2@xmath2 ( fwhm ) at 1.4ghz .",
    "mosaicking is necessary to cover the large area of the cosmos field .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief description of the survey objective (  [ sec : objective ] ) , the details of the observations and data reduction are presented in  [ sec : obs ] and  [ sec : red ] , respectively . in  [ sec : test ] , we discuss our tests for flux and astrometric calibration .",
    "the vla - cosmos catalog is described in  [ sec : cat ] , while the context of the vla - cosmos survey within the cosmos project is discussed in  [ sec : cosmos ] .",
    "unlike most existing deep survey fields , the cosmos field is equatorial and hence has excellent accessibility from all ground - based facilities ( current and future such as [ e]vla and alma ) .",
    "in addition , it has an extensive multi - wavelength coverage @xcite .",
    "this makes it an ideal field to analyze the ( faint ) radio source population as a function of redshift , environment , galaxy morphology and other properties .",
    "the vla - cosmos radio observations were matched to study a range of important issues related to the history of star formation , the growth of super - massive black holes , and the spatial clustering of galaxies .",
    "the ongoing spectroscopic surveys within the cosmos project are also targeting well - defined samples of radio sources as part of the overall program .",
    "in addition , the vla - cosmos radio survey is providing the absolute astrometric frame for the cosmos field @xcite , which is important given the field s large size .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail the observing procedure , and various tests on data quality and characteristics ( astrometry , fitted source parameters , etc . ; see also the pilot project paper by * ? ? ?",
    "the completeness tests and the number counts of this survey are under - way ( bondi et al . , in prep . ) as well as the identification of optical counterparts using the space- and ground - based cosmos imaging data ( ciliegi et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the full source catalog is available from the cosmos archive at ipac / irsa .",
    "subsequent papers will consider important scientific issues such as : ( i ) the evolution of radio - loud agn as a function of environment , including comparison to x - ray agn and clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a search for type - ii radio qsos , and ( ii ) a dust - unbiased survey of star forming galaxies , as revealed in the sub - mjy radio source population , including consideration of the evolution of the radio - fir correlation out to @xmath13 through comparison with the spitzer data , and of extreme , high @xmath14 starbursts as seen in the mambo 250 ghz cosmos survey @xcite . in the following sections we describe the goals of these two key science programs in more detail .",
    "the sub - mjy radio source counts provide one of the best indicators of the effect of cosmic variance : number counts of sub - mjy radio sources in fields of order of @xmath15 in diameter show a factor three variation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that such field sizes are inadequate to map cosmic large scale structure . thus to properly sample the faint radio source population and",
    "map out its cosmic structure to the largest relevant scales , it is necessary to survey a large area at the same resolution and sensitivity .",
    "proper studies of source clustering require hundreds to thousands of sources . in order to enable detailed studies of environmental effects on faint , distant radio source distributions and properties , all as a function of redshift ,",
    "several thousand sources are required as well .",
    "deep radio imaging of the @xmath1 cosmos field with @xmath16 sources allows one to probe a - unique and - key area of parameter space . the combination of high sensitivity and high spatial resolution over a large area ( see tab . [",
    "tab : survey ] ) bridges the gap between shallow , wider field surveys , such as first @xcite and nvss @xcite with about one million source entries , and ultra - sensitive ( @xmath17jy ) , narrow field ( single vla primary beam @xmath18 fwhm ) studies of a few hundred sources , such as those by @xcite .",
    "surveys which are comparable in scope to the vla - cosmos large project are the phoenix deep field survey ( pds ) , undertaken with the atca @xcite , and the vvds 02hr field done with the vla in b - array @xcite .",
    "these surveys produce a lower angular resolution and a slightly higher rms ( see tab . [",
    "tab : survey ] ) .",
    "tracing the evolution of the cosmic star formation history from optical surveys bears the large uncertainty of dust corrections ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "deep vla observations of the cosmos field can provide a unique , unobscured look at star forming galaxies and highly extincted galaxies in the full range of environment , especially in combination with the deep ( sub)mm data @xcite and deep spitzer infrared imaging @xcite to which the high resolution of the vla images provides means to properly identify luminous infrared galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] ) .",
    "the vla radio data will particularly be helpful to ( a ) trace the cosmological star formation history and ( b ) test the fir / radio correlation at high redshifts .",
    "the radio luminosity of local galaxies is well - correlated with their star formation ( sf ) rate @xcite , and needs , unlike optical tracers , no correction for dust obscuration .",
    "thus radio sources with correct spectral identification ( as star forming galaxies ) can be independently used to estimate the sf history ( of the luminous sources ) .",
    "recent work by @xcite for three deep radio surveys confirms the trend of rising star formation rate between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , however their calculated star formation rates are significantly larger than even dust - corrected optically selected star formation rates .",
    "a key uncertainty is the contribution of agn to the faint ( @xmath21 ) radio population , with estimates ranging from 20@xmath22 to 80@xmath22 for surveys down to 40@xmath7jy .",
    "the ( far)ir - radio correlation for star forming galaxies appears to hold out to high redshift @xcite .",
    "however , the number of star forming sources detected at 1.4ghz is small above @xmath23 .",
    "a thorough understanding of the ir - radio correlation out to higher redshifts is important , as it has been widely used as a distance measure for sub - mm sources without any optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "also , an important question for active star forming galaxies is the role of mergers , in particular at higher redshift .",
    "the fir imaging alone will lack sufficient resolution to address this issue , while the optical imaging will suffer from the standard problem of obscuration in these very dusty systems .",
    "only arcsecond resolution radio data will allow the determination of the spatial distribution of star formation in dusty starbursts on scales relevant for merging galaxies ( @xmath24 kpc ) .",
    "only a large field and deep radio survey can provide information about the evolution of the currently highly uncertain faint - end of the radio luminosity function .",
    "the fundamental problem in the study of the evolution of radio - loud agn has been that samples are drawn from either very wide field , but very shallow surveys , or very deep , but very small field surveys .",
    "the former are limited at high redshifts to only extreme luminosity sources , while the latter are plagued by relatively small number statistics and number variance .",
    "the vla - cosmos survey was designed to enable the study of the demographics and evolution of agn by encompassing a large cosmological volume and by providing good statistics on both radio - loud and radio - quiet agn as a function of redshift .",
    "only sub - mjy sensitivities over a wide area are adequate to detect relatively weak ( fri ) radio agn to very high redshift ( @xmath25 ) while providing a large number ( @xmath26 ) of agn sources . at lower redshift , z @xmath10 1",
    ", a sensitivity of @xmath27 is good enough to detect a significant fraction of radio - quiet , optically - selected qsos .",
    "moreover , questions regarding redshift evolution of fri and frii sources , their parent galaxy properties , and environmental dependencies can be addressed independently for qsos and radio galaxies .",
    "such observations are sensitive enough to reach the classic boundary between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn ( log l@xmath28 $ ] = 25 ) at z @xmath10 4 - 5 ( depending on the exact spectral index ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] ) .",
    "highly luminous radio - loud objects such as cygnus a with log l@xmath29 \\sim$ ] 34 @xcite should be observable out to their epoch of formation .",
    "the goal of the large project of the vla - cosmos survey was to image the entire cosmos field with an as large as possible uniform rms coverage while minimizing the observing time required .",
    "since the observations had to be finished within one configuration cycle , special requirements arose for the pointing lay - out and the observing strategy .",
    "the pointing lay - out was designed to maximize the uniform noise coverage while minimizing the number of pointings required to limit overhead due to slewing ( @xmath1030s slewing time for each change of pointing ) .",
    "a hexagonal pattern of the pointing centers provides both a uniform sensitivity distribution and a high mapping efficiency for large areas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to minimize the effect of bandwidth smearing , we used  as already tested in the pilot observations @xcite  a separation of @xmath30 between the individual field centers .",
    "a total of 23 separate pointings was required to fully cover the @xmath1 of the cosmos field ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : pos ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : point ] ) .",
    "we used the standard vla l - band continuum frequencies of 1.3649 and 1.4351ghz and the multi - channel continuum mode to minimize the effect of bandwidth smearing ( in the a configuration ) .",
    "this results in two intermediate frequencies ( if ) with two polarizations , providing 6 useable channels of 3.125mhz each , or a total bandwidth of 37.5mhz ( observed with both polarizations ) .",
    "( nominally , 7 channels are available , however , due to the largely reduced sensitivity in the last channel , we only used channels 1 to 6 . )",
    "the quasar 0521 + 166 ( 3c138 ) served as flux and bandpass calibrator and was observed at the beginning of each observation . to allow for good correction of atmospheric amplitude and phase variations , we selected the quasar 1024 - 008 which was already used in the pilot observations @xcite . 1024 - 008 is about 6.1@xmath31 away from the cosmos field center and has a flux of about 1 jy at 1.4ghz .",
    "its positional accuracy is better than @xmath32 ( vla calibrator manual 2003 ) ; the positional difference is less than @xmath33 between coordinates listed in the vla calibrator manual and its icrf ( international celestial reference frame ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) position .",
    "the quasar 0925 + 003 at a distance of about 9@xmath31 from the cosmos field center was observed to test the absolute astrometric accuracy of the observations .",
    "its positional accuracy is known to better than @xmath34 , and its 1.4ghz flux is similar to the one of 1024 - 008 .",
    "it was also used to test the flux calibration ( see section [ sec : test ] ) .",
    "this project holds the status of a vla large project , as it required 240hrs of observing time in the a configuration alone .",
    "the observations were scheduled in blocks of 6hrs centered at the local siderial time ( lst ) of 10:00hr .",
    "this ensured that the cosmos field was always above 40@xmath31 elevation during our observations to keep the system temperature of the l - band receivers low .",
    "these observing blocks were scheduled over 42 days between september 23th , 2004 and january 9th , 2005 for the a configuration , and between august 26th , 2005 and september , 25 , 2005 for the c configuration . the observing time for the c configuration consisted of 4 observing blocks each 6hrs long , except for the last observation that was 1.5hrs longer .    in order to minimize the impact of varying observing conditions  especially during the a array observations  onto the mosaic we adopted the following scheme : ( a ) all 23 pointings were observed with about 6.5 minutes integration time twice each day , ( b ) the starting pointing was changed each time , ( c ) the flux calibrator 0521 + 166 was only observed at the beginning ( since interpolation between days in case of a loss was acceptable ) . ]",
    "( d ) the phase calibrator 1024 - 008 was observed every 28 to 35 minutes , and ( e ) the test calibrator 0925 + 003 was observed twice each day after about one - third and two - thirds of the available observing time .",
    "the rotation of the pointings with observing days also resulted in a more complete @xmath35 coverage , and therefore a rounder synthesized ( i.e. dirty ) beam .",
    "the data reduction was done using the astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) following the standard routines as described in the vla handbook on data reduction .",
    "for the flux calibration and the correction of the atmospheric distortions we used the pseudo - continuum channel . before and after this calibration , @xmath35 points ( of the two calibrators 0521 + 166 and 1024 - 008 ) affected by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) were flagged by hand using the aips task tvflag. as the data were obtained in the multi - channel continuum mode , a bandpass calibration was performed on the line data after the flux and phase calibration of the pseudo - continuum channel had been transfered to the line data . in order to exclude remaining rfi in the source data ( i.e. the individual cosmos fields ) , we checked all channels ( per if and polarization ) for rfi using tvflg and flagged affected points accordingly . during all a - array observations , significant rfi ( affecting @xmath10 15% of the data )",
    "was found to be present on if2 in channel 4 to 6 .",
    "in addition , all @xmath35 data points in the a - array data above an amplitude of 0.4jy were clipped , since no such strong source is present in any individual field .",
    "the c - array observations were affected by strong rfi and solar interference , so that only baselines larger than 2.5 k@xmath36 and 1 k@xmath36 were included from the data of the first three days and the last day of observations , respectively .",
    "the clipping level was set to 0.45 jy for the c - array data .",
    "we performed substantial testing for best imaging quality including the application of self - calibration on the cosmos fields themselves .",
    "it was found that no combination of parameters for the self - calibration in the task calib would yield a significant improvement of the rms ( of @xmath37 3% ) .",
    "a robust weighting of 0 provided the best compromise for the combined a+c array data between a fairly gaussian synthesized beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig : robust ] ) , and still good sensitivity , i.e. the deviation from gaussianity only starts below @xmath3810% of the peak .",
    "this proved to be especially important for fields which contained bright sources ( with peak fluxes up to 10mjy / beam ) where tests showed that sidelobe artifacts are lowest when using a robust weighting of 0 .",
    "the nominal increase in the noise compared to natural weighting is 1.265 . however , the gain in better cleaning results around bright sources is larger than this nominal increase .",
    "thus in order to achieve an uniform as possible rms across the entire cosmos field , a robust weighting of 0 is used .    in order to avoid",
    "geometric distortions due to the non - planarity of the wide - field on the sky , each field was divided into 43 facets of 2048@xmath32048 pixels which were imaged using the option do3dimag in the aips task imagr. the pixel scale of @xmath39/pixel has been well matched to the a+c - array beam size of fhwm @xmath40 ( pa @xmath41 ) for a robust weighting of 0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : robust ] and [ fig : beam ] ) . for each field ,",
    "a contiguous area of about 1@xmath31 diameter was covered by the facets .",
    "additional smaller facets of 128@xmath3128 pixels were made using the task setfc for positions of nvss sources with peak fluxes above 0.1 jy and within a radial distance of 1.5@xmath31 from the pointing center .",
    "this ensured that sidelobes from strong sources outside the central 1@xmath31 were cleaned as well .",
    "since most of the cosmos fields are affected by the sidelobes of radio galaxies with peak fluxes between 1 to 15 mjy / beam , best cleaning results were obtained if clean boxes for individual sources were provided .",
    "this ensured that cleaning of negative or positive residuals was minimized . in order to derive the clean boxes for each field",
    ", we used the aips task imagr to interactively select the clean boxes in all facets where significant sources were present .",
    "this procedure was performed combining the data of all polarizations and ifs into one single image to obtain the highest possible s / n image . the resulting list of clean boxes was saved .",
    "in addition , we required that clean components were subtracted from the @xmath35 data after a facet had been cleaned .",
    "this way , clean components in overlapping facets were not treated separately .",
    "in addition , this requirement also reduced the effect of sidelobe bumps from strong sources in neighboring facets .",
    "we would like to note at this point that the reduction process of the vla - cosmos pilot and large dataset was not exactly identical .",
    "while self - calibration was applied to the pilot data , this step was not done while reducing the large survey data : after detailed empirical testing of the improvements due to self - calibration in the vla - cosmos large project , we concluded that no significant improvement was achieved , likely due to the lack of sufficiently bright sources in all parts of the entire cosmos field .",
    "since self - calibration adjusts the observed visibility phases to model phases , it has the potential to alter the position of a given source .",
    "however , it is expected that these effects cancel out when using several sources within a given pointing .    for the final stage of cleaning , it turned out that the well known beam squint of the vla ( i.e. slightly different pointing centers for r and l polarization ) , and the slightly different frequency coverages required separate imaging of all polarizations and if combinations .",
    "the four separate imagr runs were performed with the same list of clean boxes in the automatic mode .",
    "the number of iterations was set to 100,000 , with a flux limit of 45@xmath7jy / beam ( @xmath42 in a single image of a field ) and a gain of 0.1 to optimize the cleaning of the facets .",
    "the 43 facets forming the contiguous area were combined using the aips task flatn. the four separate images were then combined using the aips task comb to obtain a single image for each field . due to the combination of bandwidth smearing and a significant drop in sensitivity outside the radius of the half power beam width",
    ", we decided to use a cut - off radius of 0.4 ( corresponding to a radius of @xmath43 ) when combining the individual fields into the final mosaic using the task flatn. the resulting image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] .",
    "we performed a number of tests to evaluate our flux ( see  [ subsec : flux ] ) and astrometric calibration ( see  [ subsec : astro ] ) as well as the impact of the clean procedure .",

    "all noise distributions extracted for various boxes across the part of the field that has an uniform background showed a gaussian distribution demonstrating that no artifacts have been introduced during the clean process .",
    "the second phase calibrator 0925 + 003 was observed twice each day to allow for assessment of the absolute astrometry and the flux calibration .",
    "most of the following tests were performed on the a - array only data , since it covered a wide range in time .",
    "we imaged the calibrator 0925 + 003 for each day , as well as the two observations per day separately .",

    "the trends of the peak flux of 0925 + 003 and 1024 - 008 are not the same over the course of the observations in the a configuration ( fig .",

    "note that the error in the flux estimation for calibrator 1024 - 008 is significantly higher on day mjd 60038 ( november 11th , 2004 ) .",

    "the rms in the maps for those days is about @xmath52 times the typical rms in the 0925 + 003 maps .",
    "the higher noise is likely to be caused by worse weather conditions ( e.g. it was snowing on november 13th , 2004 ) and/or technical problems during observations ( e.g. rfi , intermittent fluctuations of the system temperature @xmath53 , data corruption on particular antennas ) .",
    "thus we conclude that our flux calibration is within the errors expected .",
    "given the angular resolution of the combined a+c array data of @xmath40 ( fwhm ) , we expect to achieve a positional accuracy of @xmath54 ( corresponding to 1/10th of the beam size ; see * ? ? ?",

    "a non - zero offset in ra and dec of 53  mas and 45  mas , respectively , has been found relative to the nominal position of 0925 + 003 .",
    "this offset is likely the result of the large angular separation of 14.5@xmath31 between the two calibrators ( i.e. 0925 + 003 and 1024 - 008 ) , which could lead to residual phase transfer errors due to , for example , differential refraction corrections .",
    "we consider this offset as an upper limit to our absolute astrometry error , since the ( center of the ) cosmos field is only 6@xmath31 away from the phase calibrator 1024 - 008 .    to test the quality of our relative astrometry , we extracted sources from each single field and compared their positions to the ones extracted from the combined mosaic .",

    "in addition , we compared the positions of radio sources extracted from the vla - cosmos pilot and the large project . however , we consider this not a completely independent test , as the same phase calibrator was used for both projects .",
    "we find a median offset of -50mas and 90mas in @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , while the rms scatter is 161mas and 189mas for the first and latter .",
    "the rms scatter is slightly higher than the above derived accuracy of our relative astrometry ( @xmath10130  mas ) using only the large project .",
    "however , this is expected as the rms and the beam size of the pilot project is larger : 25@xmath7jy / beam vs. 10@xmath7jy / beam and @xmath79 vs. @xmath40 .",
    "the derived astrometric differences between the pilot and the large projects are well within our errors ( see  [ subsec : imag ] for data reduction difference between both projects ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that our relative astrometric accuracy for the vla - cosmos large project is @xmath10130  mas and discard this higher rms scatter found from the comparison to the pilot data .    based on arguments presented above ,",
    "we conclude that the overall astrometric errors of our derived source positions are dominated by the uncertainty in the position extraction ( due to our beam size ) of @xmath80mas .",
    "our absolute astrometric accuracy is likely to be better than 55mas .",
    "in order to select a sample of radio components from the largest imaged area above a given threshold , defined in terms of the local signal to noise ratio , we adopted the following approach .",
    "first the software package sextractor was used to estimate the local background in each mesh of a grid covering the whole surveyed area ( see * ? ? ? * for a general description of sextractor ) .",
    "different noise maps with mesh sizes ranging from 25 to 100 pixels were produced and examined .",
    "the fractional difference between the rms measured in the sextractor noise maps and the rms directly measured on the real map is very small ( @xmath102% ) over the whole map ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mesh ] ) . in the end",
    ", we adopted a mesh size of 50 pixels corresponding to @xmath81 which was found to be the best compromise between closely sampling the variations in rms and avoiding contamination by larger radio sources .",
    "the rms values range from about 9@xmath7jy / beam in the inner regions to about 20@xmath7jy / beam at the edges of the mosaic with values as high as @xmath82jy / beam around the few relatively strong sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] ) .",
    "the mean rms in the inner @xmath83 is 10.5@xmath7jy / beam , the mean rms over the @xmath1 area is 15.0@xmath7jy / beam . the cumulative area as a function of rms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] .    as a next step ,",
    "the aips task sad was used to obtain a catalog of candidate components .",
    "sad attempts to find all the components whose peaks are brighter than a given flux level . in order to detect radio components down to the 30@xmath7jy / beam level",
    "sad was run several times with different search levels ( with a decreasing flux limit ) using the resulting residual image each time .",
    "we recovered all the radio components with a peak flux @xmath84 ( corresponding to roughly 3@xmath46 in the higher sensitivity regions ) . for each component sad",
    "provides peak flux , total flux , position and size estimated using a gaussian fit .",
    "however , for faint components the gaussian fit may be unreliable and a better estimate of the peak flux ( crucial for the selection based on s / n ) can be obtained with a non - parametric second - degree interpolation using the aips task maxfit. we ran maxfit on all the components found by sad and selected only those components for which the peak flux density found by maxfit was greater or equal to 4.5 times the local rms as derived from the noise map .",
    "the ( non - parametric ) peak position and flux density as determined by maxfit were kept , as the so derived values should be less affected by assumptions on the real brightness distribution .    finally , we visually inspected the s / n mosaic image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snr ] ) for components that could have been missed by sad. the most likely reason for missing sources is that sad only recovers components that can be fitted by a gaussian fulfilling certain parameters .",
    "thus , if the fit for a potential component fails , this component is rejected from the catalogue provided by sad. therefore , the aips tasks jmfit and maxfit were run on these potential components to derive their properties .    in order to exclude 1-pixel wide noise peaks above the detection threshold ( 4.5@xmath46 ) ,",
    "more scrutiny was used for the 294 components fitted with both sizes smaller than the clean beam . only those components ( 171 )",
    "for which jmfit was able to estimate an upper limit to the source size greater than the clean beam were kept while the remaining ( 123 ) were identified as noise spikes and excluded from the catalogue . as a result of the whole procedure a total of 3823 components have been selected ( 3204 from sad+maxfit and 619 from the s / n image ) .",
    "a more complete analysis on the completeness and possible biases affecting the catalogue will be described in a future paper along with the number counts ( bondi et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "some of the components clearly belong to a single radio source ( e.g. jets and lobes of an extended radio galaxy ) , in other more complex cases we have also used the optical ground- and space - based images to discriminate between different components of the same radio source or separate radio sources . the final catalog ( see tab . [",
    "tab : cat ] ; see below ) lists 3643 radio sources of which 80 are multiple , i.e. better described by more than a single component .",

    "this is a factor of 2 more than expected from the algorithm used which was set to a false detection rate of 5% @xcite .",
    "as all of the false detection are lying in areas with a large gradient in the background ( i.e. overlap areas of the individual pointings at the edge of the field ) , this strongly suggests that the local rms was underestimated in these areas and that the used mesh size of @xmath98 was too large in these areas .",

    "however , the flux measurements agree within the quoted errors for most sources .",
    "the agreement in the integrated flux ( also with the error ) is lower for very bright sources ( @xmath100 ) .",
