    "the difference of the structure function for a bounded nucleon which measured on a nuclear target , first was found by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) .",
    "it then compared with a quasi - free nucleon measured on deuterium target .",
    "this phenomenon is called the emc effect . due to this effect",
    ", much experimental and theoretical efforts have been done to investigate the features of the bounded nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "+ we need a model to account for the structure of a free nucleon and will use it as a base for studying its bounded features .",
    "such a model should first include the relationship between the constituent quark and the current quark .",
    "it should also be in a good agreement with the dis data on a free nucleon .",
    "some papers can be found in which the valon model has been used to extract new information for parton distributions and hadron structure functions @xcite . in what follows",
    "we employ the expression of the nucleon structure function for a free nucleon used by hwa and zahir@xcite @xmath3 here the summation runs over all constituent quarks or valons and @xmath4 is the free valon distributions in the nucleon which has nothing to do with a probe . in eq.(1 ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the nucleon and valon structure functions which are depends on @xmath7 and the nature of the probe .",
    "the distribution function @xmath4 governed by nonperturbative qcd , i.e. , the implication of the factorization assumption . in considering the constituent quark model in nuclear structure function , there are two kind of valons : bounded valons in nuclei and free ones in nucleon .",
    "there is a relation between these two distributions which will be discussed in more details in next section .",
    "a free nucleon in the constituent - quark model can be considered as a composite system consisting of three constituent quarks .",
    "their distribution in a nucleon satisfies normalized condition @xmath8 and the momentum sum rule @xmath9    the sum rule means that each constituent quark carries , on an average , one - third of the longitudinal momentum of a nucleon .",
    "the form of the distribution @xmath10 is determined by the interactions among the constituent quarks and is independent of probe . for bounded nucleon",
    "we suppose that it still consists of three constituent quarks in the same manner as a free nucleon , i.e. , the normalized condition is , @xmath11    in addition , not only the binding interactions with a few mev do not change the longitudinal momentum carried by each bounded nucleon in dis , but also they do not change the average longitudinal momentum carried by each constituent quark . therefore , under the condition of the approximation it seems to be reasonable to suppose that the momentum sum rule @xmath12 is valid in the same manner as a free nucleon . the distribution of the @xmath13-constituent quark in a bounded nucleon which simultaneously satisfies the conditions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be written as @xmath14 where",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are called distortion factor for @xmath13-valon@xcite .",
    "we can employ the same strategy for other constituent quarks .",
    "if we supposed @xmath17 then we can find @xmath18 .",
    "now we can introduce the nuclear valon distribution in @xmath0-nuclei .",
    "our ansatz for the relation of valon distribution in @xmath0 nucleon and bounded valon distribution is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-valon distribution in the @xmath0 nucleus .",
    "we call @xmath22 as a weight function , which takes into account the nuclear modification .",
    "the weight function for instance of @xmath13-valon , @xmath23 , is @xmath24 we can have a similar weight functions for other constituent quarks in nuclear .",
    "we can get eventually the nuclear valon distribution in the same method@xcite as in following @xmath25 and @xmath26 using the convolution integral we can obtain all of the nuclear quark distribution functions , @xmath27    now using eqs.(12 - 14 ) we can extract nuclear sea quark distribution . by substituting the obtained nuclear quark distribution in the definition of nuclear structure function as@xcite @xmath28\\;,\\ ] ]",
    "we find that there are some unknown parameters which initially appeared in eq.(7 ) .",
    "all of the unknown parameters can be obtained by fitting the ration of @xmath2 to experimental data@xcite . using the cern subroutine minuit@xcite",
    ", we can define a global @xmath29 for all the experimental data points and find an acceptable fit .",
    "in fig.1 we presented the analytical results for ratio of @xmath30 at @xmath31 and compared it with available experimental data .",
