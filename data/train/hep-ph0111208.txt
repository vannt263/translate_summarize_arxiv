    "instanton is the first explicit example of nonperturbative ( np ) quantum fluctuation of gluon field in qcd .",
    "it was introduced in 1975 by polyakov and coauthors  @xcite .",
    "an important development originated with t  hooft s classic paper  @xcite , in which he calculated the semi - classical tunneling rate .",
    "instanton gas as a model of qcd vacuum was proposed in pioneer works by callan , dashen and gross  @xcite .",
    "these topologically nontrivial field configurations are essential for the solution of some problems of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "instantons allow to explain anomalous breaking of @xmath0 symmetry and the @xmath1 mass  @xcite .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) can be explained with the help of instanton and anti - instanton field configurations in qcd vacuum  @xcite",
    ". an important role of instantons in scalar and pseudoscalar channels was pointed out in paper  @xcite .",
    "taking into account instantons is of crucial importance for many phenomena of qcd ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    at the same time , there is a number of serious problems in instanton physics .",
    "the first is the divergence of integrals over instanton size @xmath2 at big @xmath2 .",
    "this makes it impossible to calculate instantons contribution to some physical quantities , such as vacuum gluon condensate .",
    "second ,  area law  for wilson loop can not be explained in instanton gas model , hence quasiclassical instanton anti - instanton vacuum lacks confinement which is responsible for hadron spectra .",
    "there were many theoretical works aimed to solve the problem of instanton instability in it s size @xmath2 .",
    "to some extent they all were based on an attempt to stabilize instanton ensemble due to effects of interaction between pseudoparticles .",
    "the most popular is the model of  instanton liquid  , which was phenomenologically formulated by shuryak  @xcite .",
    "it states that average distance between pseudoparticles is @xmath3  fm and their average size is @xmath4  fm .",
    "thus , @xmath5 and vacuum consists of well separated , and therefore not very much deformed , instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "quantitatively close results were obtained by diakonov and petrov  @xcite . in their approach stabilization",
    "is related to discovered by them classical repulsion between pseudoparticles .",
    "however , further development  @xcite revealed that instanton ensemble can not be stabilized due to purely classical interaction.thus , the mechanism for the suppression of large - size instantons in the ensemble of topologically non - trivial fields is still not understood .    on the other hand ,",
    "qcd vacuum contains not only quasiclassical instantons , but also other nonperturbative fields .",
    "the investigation of instantons behavior in stochastic qcd vacuum , which is parametrized by  vacuum correlators ",
    "( i.e. nonlocal gauge invariant averages of gluon field strength ) was started in refs .",
    "it was shown , that in nonperturbative vacuum standard perturbation theory for instanton changes , which leads to  freezing  of effective coupling constant .",
    "it was then found in  @xcite that nonlocal interaction between large - size instanton ( @xmath6  fm ) and nonperturbative stochastic background field does not lead to it s infrared inflation .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate that instanton can be stabilized in nonperturbative vacuum and exist as a stable topologically nontrivial field configuration against the background of stochastic nonperturbative fields , which are responsible for confinement , and to find quantitatively it s size .",
    "we evaluate nonlocal effective action for instanton in np vacuum in gauge invariant way , describing vacuum in terms of  vacuum correlators  , and show that in bilocal approximation effective action has a minimum at the definite instanton size @xmath7 .",
