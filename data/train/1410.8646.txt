    "the outcome of the @xcite rapid monolithic collapse ( els ) model is an old metal - poor galactic halo with enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] values , and a young metal - rich disk with near - solar [ @xmath0/fe ] . in this picture ,",
    "stellar [ @xmath0/fe ] values diminish as a function of galactic time as metallicity increases from nucleosynthetic feedback that is a sensitive function of stellar mass .",
    "however , stars in the galaxy do not strictly follow the simple trend expected by els model .",
    "@xcite reported the low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) star bd+80@xmath7245 to have an abnormally low average [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath8 .",

    "other examples include s sample of low-@xmath0 halo stars with large apogalactocentric distances , the expanded @xcite sample of low-@xmath0 halo stars that are weakly bound and evince predominantly retrograde orbits , the young globular clusters rup 106 and pal 12 @xcite , and the halo field common proper motion pair hd 134439 and 134440 @xcite .",
    "the early els picture of galactic formation is undoubtedly much too simplistic , lacking consideration of a variety of important feedback mechanisms associated with star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effects of recycling timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the consequences of rapid infall of cool intergalactic gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "regardless , the existence of low-@xmath0 stars suggests that an additional or alternative formation mechanism of the galactic halo is required to explain these abundance patterns .    by examining color - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters in the galactic halo",
    ", @xcite found a diverse horizontal - branch morphology corresponding to an age spread of @xmath9 years , suggesting the halo formation timescale lasted longer than a free - fall time .",
    "consequently , they suggested the outer halo of the galaxy may be a product of accreted fragments that formed independently of the galactic collapse .",
    "indeed , a variety of surveys evince the presence of significant tidal streams @xcite and substructure @xcite in the halo that is interpreted as detritus from dwarf galaxy encounters @xcite .",
    "current hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of late - type spirals naturally produce stellar halos populated by accreted ex - situ stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this hierarchical picture of galactic development is supported by additional independent evidence .",
    "for example , presolar sic grains show unexpected si isotopic ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can be explained by a solar birth environment located in the remains of a merger event with a metal - poor satellite galaxy 5 - 6 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "large pre - solar @xmath10o abundances have also been explained as the result of feedback of sne outbreaks caused by the merger of a satellite galaxy with the milky way @xcite .",

    "the properties of present - day dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) systems provide evidence of hierarchical formation of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "dsphs have distinctly different environments than the milky way  notably their irregular and/or small star formation rates and strong galactic winds that exhaust their gas content quickly @xcite . the low star formation rate , and thus slow metal enrichment , in dsph galaxies results in their stellar members possessing elemental abundance ratios similar to more metal - rich galactic stars .",
    "hence , the metal - poor [ @xmath0/fe ] values in dsphs would be lower than a galactic halo star of the same metallicity .",

    "elemental abundances from previous analyses ( see  3 ) were manual inputs in the stellar syntheses ; abundances of other elements ( except be , c , n , o , and ag , whose abundances are determined here ) were scaled to the solar values according to the [ fe / h ] value taken here ( @xmath49 dex and @xmath50 dex for hd 134439 and 134440 , respectively ) .",

    "these absolute abundances , however , would then be normalized by an equivalently different adopted solar abundance .",

    "the total uncertainties in the [ cno / fe [ ratios are found by adding the parameter - based , continuum - based , and measurement uncertainties in quadrature , and are listed in listed in the final column of table [ tab : sensitivities ] .",
    "the major contribution to the final uncertainties originates from uncertainties in t@xmath21 ; our elemental abundances are less sensitive to other quantities , especially @xmath22 .",
    "the mean [ cno / fe ] values in hd 134439 versus hd 134440 differ by 0.09 - 0.27 dex .",
    "the difference between the hd 134439 and 134440 @xmath68 values according to the newer infrared flux method results of @xcite is 88 k lower than that associated with our adopted values .",
    "this would diminish the [ cno / fe ] differences by 0.05 - 0.09 dex , bringing the [ no / fe ] ratios into near - perfect agreement and leaving a 0.22 dex difference in [ c / fe ] .",
    "regardless , our o and n ratios in the two stars differ at the @xmath69 level , and the 0.27 dex difference in the c ratio is at the @xmath70 level ; a difference of this latter size in one of the 22 elemental ratios collected in table 7 is expected in a statistical sense",
    ". the modest cno differences between the two stars do not affect the salient result that [ cno / fe ] are all markedly low compared to the galactic halo field .",
    "regarding possible systematic errors , the referee reminds us that the cno abundances derived from molecular features depend sensitively on the @xmath71 structure of the upper layers of the model atmospheres .",
    "computations of 3d hydrodynamic model atmospheres suggests that the adequacy of the @xmath71 structure of 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres declines with metallicity ( compare , e.g. , figures 1 and 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "any metallicity - dependent component of this difference would not be removed by a differential analysis with respect to the sun . one way to mitigate",
    "the impact of such possible effects is to compare our abundances with those in similar metallicity galactic halo stars that are also derived from molecular features ; we do this in  3.2 .",
    "we group and list 22 elements with abundance determinations in hd 134439/440 in the first two columns of table [ tab : abundances ] . columns 3 and 4 give the [ x / fe ] values for hd 134439 and 134440 , respectively ; cno and ag abundances are those derived in this study , fe is taken from @xcite , and the remainder are from @xcite .",

    "* ) are listed in the final column .",
    "we plot the average hd 134439/440 abundance ratio versus condensation temperature in figure [ fig : xfe ] .",
    "the cno abundance ratios ( at low t@xmath73 ) are comparatively lower than those of the majority of refractory elements at high t@xmath73 .",
    "the size of the spearman s rank coefficient ( 0.422 ) , which measures the correlation between the abundances and t@xmath73 via the monotonicity of the rankings of the two variables with no underlying assumptions concerning their parent distributions @xcite , indicates only a 5% probability that the observed correlation could occur by chance in an uncorrelated sample  not inconsistent with claims of chemical pollution via planetesimal / refractory accretion @xcite .",
    "the mean difference in abundance ratios ( hd 134439 @xmath74 hd 134440 ; ) from table [ tab : abundances ] is @xmath75 dex with scatter ( @xmath76 dex ) that is consistent with uncertainties . given a ) the two stars convection zone depths that differ by @xmath77 based upon our t@xmath21 and the model estimates from figure 2 of @xcite , and b ) possible differences in the mass / composition of material putatively accreted by each star , remarkable fine - tuning would have been required for them to now exhibit indistinguishable post - accretion abundance patterns .",
    "we are thus led to examine other interpretations of the [ x / fe ] verus t@xmath73 relationship .",
    "one such interpretation is that the [ x / fe]-t@xmath73 correlation is simply an unremarkable result of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we explore this possibility by comparing hd 134439 and 134440 to galactic halo stars of similar [ fe / h ] , adopting typical [ x / fe ] values of halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath1 using the observational data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( for their high-@xmath14 stars ) with a few exceptions .",
    "first , we believe the high [ n / fe ] values at [ fe / h]@xmath19 shown in @xcite are due to mixing in evolved giants .",
    "the near - uv nh - based [ n / fe ] values in unmixed or unevolved stars from the studies of and consistently indicate that [ n / fe]=@xmath78 at [ fe / h]@xmath79 .",
    "the primary nucleosynthetic behavior of n this result implies has long been suspected ",
    "grave uncertainties in previous n abundance determinations not withstanding ( e.g. , and @xcite ) .",
    "a value of [ n / fe]@xmath80 at [ fe / h]@xmath79 is also in excellent agreement with a metal - poor extension of the cn - based [ n / fe ] ratios in more metal - rich giants from that are presumably immune from the effects of cn - cycling .",
    "second , we adopt the oh - based oxygen ratios in metal - poor field stars of @xcite to compare with our molecular - based results in hd 134439/440 .",
    "third , we adopt the ch - based carbon ratios in metal - poor field stars from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to compare with our molecular - based results .",
    "fourth , we adopt al and k data compiled by ( * ? ? ?",

    "fifth , we adopt the galactic y and ba data compiled by @xcite . finally , galactic ag data is taken from @xcite .",
    "the mean galactic halo abundance ratios at [ fe / h]@xmath81 have a negligible correlation with @xmath18 ( upper panel of figure [ fig : halo ] ) .",
    "the contrast between the mean galactic halo field and hd 134439/134440 is seen in the lower panel of figure [ fig : halo ] ; the differential abundance ratios ( our stars @xmath74 halo ) demonstrate a correlation with @xmath18 at the @xmath82% confidence level .",
    "this is largely driven by cno : the spearman - based correlation excluding cno is significant at only the @xmath83 confidence level .    given the multiplicity of nucleosynthetic sites for cno production and uncertainties in our understanding of non - standard stellar mixing , winds , etc , it is possible that the [ x / fe]-@xmath18 correlation in hd 134439/440 is simply the consequence of integrated stochastic effects of their chemical evolution .",
    "however , the unusual @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 values of our 2 stars suggest their relevant preceding chemical evolution history did not transpire in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , we explore alternate explanations of the abundance correlation and the low-@xmath0 phenomenon .",
    "there are interesting similarities between the hd 134439/440 abundance patterns and those of galactic globular cluster red giants , for which considerable evidence of proton - capture nucleosynthesis has been observed @xcite . deep mixing  in situ or in previous stellar generations",

    "we thus consider whether this relation is simply an illusory one stemming from these stars unique chemical evolutionary history .",

    "the observed [ na / fe ] is well - matched by the low mass progenitor yield .",
    "the distinctly sub - solar ratio [ na / fe ] ratio ( @xmath114 ) of hd 134439/440 is thus easily explained by our proposed nucleosynthetic origin without recourse to @xmath98-related effects .",
    "the [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] values of hd 134439/134440 are also low compared to the galactic halo ( table 12 ) ; the differences are even a factor of two lower than for [ o / fe ] .",

    "the value [ cu / fe]@xmath118 for our 2 stars also need not be associated with t@xmath72-related effects inasmuch as it is not significantly different than the ratio observed in galactic halo or dsph stars ( figures [ fig : halo ] and [ fig : allfe2 ] ) . as noted by @xcite , galactic halo cu data are consistent with the type ii yields of @xcite , suggesting cu production is dominated by explosive nucleosynthesis and not production in type ia supernovae or low - to - intermediate mass stars .",
    "a couple puzzles remain .",
    "first , the observed [ mn / fe ] value is 0.30 dex larger than the @xcite [ mn / fe ] yield at 14 m@xmath111 ; however , it s interesting to note that the observed value is not anomalous with respect to dsph stars in this regard ( figure [ fig : allfe2 ] ) .",
    "second , as already noted by @xcite , our stars [ ti , ca / fe ] values are both _ larger _ than [ mg / fe ] , which is consistent neither with the @xcite [ x / fe ] yields at low progenitor mass nor the dsph results of @xcite who find [ ti , ca / fe ] ratios smaller than [ mg / fe ] .",
    "we return to the [ ti , ca / fe ] ratios in  3.6 .",
    "the preceding comparisons suggest that the abundance ratios of hd 134439/440 are dominated by nucleosynethic products of low mass progenitor type ii sne .",
    "we find no observable evidence of type ia contributions in the abundance data .",
    "such contributions are of possible interest in explaining the absolute levels of [ o / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] , which are some 0.30 dex lower and higher ( respectively ) than the @xcite 14 m@xmath111 progenitor yields ; these differences are qualitatively consistent with lower and higher ( respectively ) ratios expected from type ia event yields .",
    "we constructed simple type ii / ia mixture models from the @xcite type ii yields for a given progenitor mass and the type ia yields from @xcite as tabulated in .",
    "the type ia yield was weighted so as to reproduce the observed mean [ o / fe ] of our stars when combined with the type ii yields .",
    "resulting [ x / fe ] yields from the type ii / ia mixture were then computed .",
    "this process was then repeated using different type ii progenitor masses to produce multiple type ii / ia mixture models .",
    "all such mixtures are unable to consistently reproduce the observed abundance ratios .",
    "we typically find that , simultaneously , the [ ni / fe ] yields are @xmath119 dex larger than observed , [ mn / fe ] becomes overenhanced by @xmath120 dex , [ na / fe ] is @xmath119 lower than observed , and the predicted [ ti / fe ] yield ratios become even lower compared to the data .        while silver may seem an unconventional choice of element with which to explore @xmath2-capture nucleosynthesis , its great utility comes from observably strong transitions of _ neutral _ features in the near - uv .",
    "the observed @xmath2-capture transitions upon which most of our knowledge of galactic and dsph abundance patterns are built are primarily singly ionized lines in low gravity red giants that can be vanishingly weak in our metal - poor cool dwarfs .",
