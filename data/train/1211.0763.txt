    "this article addresses the following question :    _  is the relationship between a complex reductive group and its langlands dual + a form of t - duality ? _",
    "this question arises because a reductive group can be interpreted as a principal torus bundle for a maximal torus , and the maximal tori of langlands dual groups are canonically @xmath0-dual .",
    "let us make the above question more precise .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a complex reductive group .",
    "choosing a maximal torus @xmath2 allows one to define a root datum of @xmath1 : @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the sets of roots and coroots of @xmath1 , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are its character and co - character lattices .",
    "a root datum determines the reductive group @xmath1 up to isomorphism .",
    "interchanging the roles of roots and coroots and of the character and co - character lattices results in a new root datum : @xmath8 the langlands dual group of @xmath1 is the complex reductive group @xmath9 ( unique up to isomorphism ) determined by the dual root datum @xmath10 .",
    "a root datum also implies a choice of maximal torus @xmath2 via the canonical isomorphism @xmath11 and likewise a natural choice of maximal torus for the langlands dual group @xmath9 : @xmath12 by definition , the torus @xmath13 is the @xmath0-dual of @xmath14.-dual torus @xmath15 . to obtain a compact version , which is more common in the @xmath0-duality literature ,",
    "one simply begins with a compact form of @xmath1 instead of a complex form . ]",
    "the translation action of a maximal torus makes @xmath16 a principal torus bundle .",
    "thus given that the maximal tori of langlands dual groups are @xmath0-dual , it is natural to ask whether @xmath1 viewed as a principal @xmath14-bundle , and @xmath9 viewed as a principal @xmath13-bundle , are @xmath0-dual to one another .",
    "a problem that immediately presents itself is that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are torus bundles over different spaces , whereas @xmath0-duality is a relationship between torus bundles over a common base space .",
    "however , if the simple factors of @xmath1 are all of dynkin type @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , then the manifolds @xmath21 and @xmath22 are isomorphic . therefore , for such groups the question of @xmath0-duality for langlands duals is well - defined .",
    "but even if the base manifolds @xmath21 and @xmath22 are isomorphic , @xmath1 and @xmath9 only have a hope of being @xmath0-dual if we twist the duality by introducing @xmath23-fluxes on each space .",
    "an @xmath23-flux on a principal @xmath14-bundle is a closed , @xmath14-invariant , integral 3-form on the total space of the bundle .",
    "indeed , a pair of torus bundles without @xmath23-flux are @xmath0-dual if and only if both torus bundles are flat , which is generally not the case for the bundles @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the main theorem of this paper asserts ( roughly ) that when the flag manifolds @xmath21 and @xmath22 are isomorphic there is a natural choice of @xmath23-flux on @xmath1 and on @xmath9 such that the two groups are @xmath0-dual . to make this more precise",
    ", we should say what the relevant @xmath23-fluxes are :    recall that on every lie group @xmath1 there is a natural 3-form called the cartan 3-form .",
    "it is the left invariant 3-form defined by @xmath24),\\qquad x , y , z\\in \\gf,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the killing form of @xmath1 .",
    "this form is indeed integral and closed , so it is an @xmath23-flux on @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a reductive lie group whose simple lie algebra factors are all of type ade .",
    "then the principal bundles with @xmath23-flux @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath0-dual . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the cartan 3-forms of @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "* interpretations . * philosophically , there are two possible interpretations of our main theorem :    1 .",
    "langlands duality is an example of @xmath0-duality for principal torus bundles .",
    "@xmath0-duality for a single torus is an example of langlands duality .",
    "the first is of course the direct interpretation .",
    "to arrive at the second viewpoint , observe that the cartan 3-form vanishes on a torus , so that the theorem applied to @xmath30 reduces to the duality between a torus and its @xmath0-dual .",
    "viewing langlands duality as a generalization of @xmath0-duality for a single torus leads to a question for future study : just as the duality relation on tori exhibits new phenomena when studied in families ( for instance the appearance of gerbes and noncommutative duals ) , langlands duality should exhibit new features in families as well .",
    "in other words , it would be natural to study duality for fibrations with fiber isomorphic to @xmath26 , and the effect of langlands dualization on such objects .",
    "* @xmath0-duality and langlands duality in the literature . * in this article we work in the context of differential geometric t - duality .",
    "this duality induces isomorphisms of ( t - invariant ) twisted derham complexes and twisted generalized geometrical structures on the t - dual spaces @xcite , but does not provide a k - theoretic isomorphism . after our first preprint appeared , bunke and nikolaus @xcite were led to study the topological analogue of this problem , which provides the isomorphism of k - theory .",
    "@xmath0-duality and langlands dual groups have also appeared side by side in the semi - classical limit of the geometric langlands conjecture ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , that is a very different use of @xmath0-duality than what appears in this work : in the semi - classical langlands context , @xmath0-duality relates the hitchin fibrations of @xmath1-higgs and @xmath9-higgs bundles over a common hitchin base , whereas for us , @xmath0-duality directly implements the relation between a group and its langlands dual .",
    "thus , while we do expect that there is a connection between these two applications of @xmath0-duality , it is certainly not a direct one",

    ", there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of ( connected ) complex reductive lie groups and isomorphism classes of abstract root data .",
    "it is clear from the symmetric phrasing of definition [ defn_root_datum ] that if@xmath110 is an abstract root datum , so is its dual @xmath111 .",
    "two connected reductive complex lie groups @xmath112 are * langlands duals * if the root datum of @xmath9 is isomorphic to the dual of the root datum of @xmath1 .",
    "we intend to exhibit a @xmath0-duality between langlands dual groups that are viewed as principal @xmath113-bundles via the translation actions of their maximal tori .",
    "however , the standard differential geometric formulation of @xmath0-duality is for @xmath114-bundles . to skirt this apparent incompatibility , we will , when convenient , view langlands duality as a relation between compact real forms of reductive groups .",
    "this does not lose any information since one recovers the original form by complexification , and it places us in the standard @xmath0-duality setup since a principal @xmath113-bundle structure on the complex group determines a @xmath114-bundle structure on the compact real form .",
    "thus in this section we will recall the standard definitions and notation for differential geometric @xmath0-duality , phrased for compact tori .",

    "the total space of @xmath126 may be defined as the quotient : @xmath127    the connection @xmath128 is defined by the condition that its pullback to the trivial bundle @xmath129 equals @xmath130 . here @xmath131 denotes the tautological 1-form ( also called the liouville 1-form ) that one has on @xmath132 after identifying it with the cotangent bundle of @xmath13 .    in applications to derived categories ,",
    "the poincar bundle plays a primary role .",
    "however , in the differential geometric setup one is content to forget about the bundle and only remember its curvature form @xmath133 which is ( @xmath134-times ) the standard integral symplectic form on @xmath125 .",
    "this curvature defines a chern - weil character @xmath135 , which induces an isomorphism of de rham cohomology and also of the translation invariant derham complexes , via the formula : @xmath136    the poincar line bundle also induces isomorphisms between several other sorts of data , such as ( invariant ) generalized complex structures , @xmath25-theory , and ( in the complex case ) derived categories .",
    "now let us proceed to the definition of @xmath0-duality for principal torus bundles .",
    "it turns out that this generalization is not perfectly straightforward : global non - triviality of a principal bundle results in a defect on the dual side , which is accounted for using a 3-form on the dual bundle known as an @xmath23-flux ( the necessity of this 3-from can be deduced from several perspectives , we refer the reader for example to @xcite,@xcite,@xcite or @xcite for details ) . despite this twist , it is still possible to keep the perspective that duality is implemented by a 2-form @xmath137 which plays the role of the curvature of a poincar bundle .",
    "here are the definitions :    an * ns - flux * ( also sometimes called an h - flux ) on a principal torus bundle @xmath138 is a closed , integral , @xmath14-invariant 3-form @xmath139 .",

    "3 .   let @xmath150 and @xmath151 denote the vertical tangent bundles of @xmath138 and @xmath141 , then @xmath137 restricts to a nondegenerate pairing : @xmath152    we will refer to @xmath137 as a * dualizing 2-form*.    note that @xmath148 is automatically closed ( this follows because @xmath148 is translation invariant and @xmath125 is abelian ) , and thus conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) imply that @xmath148 is an integral symplectic form on @xmath153 . in particular , @xmath148 is the curvature of some connection on a line bundle over @xmath149 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath137 itself is not a closed form , so it is not the curvature of any line bundle on @xmath154 .",
    "rather , in this global setting one has a family over @xmath140 of line bundles , which fits together to a morphism of gerbes with connection , whose 2-curving is @xmath137 .    using @xmath155 as a proxy for the chern character of a connection in equation ,",
    "one produces an isomorphism of @xmath156-graded chain complexes ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath157 which induces an isomorphism of twisted de rham cohomology @xmath158 .",
    "a t - duality also implies a bijection between the translation invariant twisted generalized geometrical structures on the two sides ( @xcite theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "there are associated maps in twisted k - theory , and twisted derived categories in the complex case , though these maps are only isomorphisms when @xmath137 satisfies an extra unimodularity condition .",
    "now that the tools are in place , we will describe how langlands duality may be regarded as an instance of @xmath0-duality .",
    "we should remark that the t - duality between @xmath159 and its langlands dual @xmath160 was first calculated in @xcite , where it appeared as an example of @xmath0-duality between lens spaces .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact lie group containing no simple factors of type @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",
    "then a langlands dual @xmath9 also has this property , and the flag manifolds @xmath21 and @xmath22 are isomorphic .    the effect of langlands dualization on a cartan matrix , whose entries are the numbers @xmath166 indexed over a set of simple roots , is simply to transpose the matrix . for simple lie algebras of type ade",
    "the cartan matrix is symmetric , and for @xmath167 and @xmath168 the transpose corresponds to a different ordering of simple roots .",
    "however , transposition of cartan matrices interchanges the types @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "in other words , the effect of dualization on simple lie alegebras is : @xmath169 only for type @xmath164 and @xmath165 does dualization change the isomorphism type of a simple lie algebra , thus for reductive lie algebras containing no factors of type @xmath164 or @xmath165 , langlands dualization results in an isomorphic lie algebra .",
    "now suppose @xmath31 has no @xmath164 or @xmath165 factors and choose an isomorphism @xmath170 .",
    "this determines an isomorphism of the flag manifolds @xmath171 since the flag manifold is isomorphic to the moduli space of borel subalgebras of @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , one obtains an isomorphism @xmath171 by exponentiating @xmath172 to an isomorphism between the universal covers @xmath173 , which induces an isomorphism of flag manifolds since @xmath174 , where @xmath175 denotes the inverse image of @xmath14 under the covering map @xmath176 .",
    "the flag manifolds of groups of type @xmath164 and @xmath177 can not be isomorphic .",
    "in fact their higher homotopy groups are non - isomorphic , as can easily be seen by comparing the long exact sequences of homotopy groups associated to @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath198 .",
    "we are finally ready to prove the @xmath14-duality statement .",
    "we denote the cartan 3-form on @xmath1 by @xmath28 and the cartan 3-from on the langland s dual @xmath201 by @xmath29 .",
    "we say a reductive group is of * ade - type * if its lie algebra is the sum of an abelian lie algebra and simple lie algebras of type a , d , or e.      the lie algebra @xmath31 decomposes as a sum of simple lie algebras and an abelian lie algebra , and langlands duality respects the decomposition so the isomorphism can be defined piecewise . for",
    "the abelian part any vector space isomorphism will do . on the semisimple",
    "part the map @xmath197 is an isomorphism of root systems precisely because of the relation @xmath205 .",

    "any two such isomorphisms would differ by an automorphism of @xmath31 which fixes each coroot .",

    "there are of course isomorphisms between the lie algebra and the langlands dual lie algebra , but they can not be chosen of the form specified in lemma . because of this , the proof of the following theorem can not be applied to @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
