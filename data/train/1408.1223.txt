    "in recent years a lot of research has been devoted to probabilistic nonsignaling theories @xcite .",
    "they are formulated in terms of _ boxes _ , that is , families of probability distributions describing correlations generated in a bell - type experiment by spatially separated observers .",
    "the boxes are required to satisfy the no - signaling principle which means that expectation values seen by some of the observers can not depend on the measurement choices made by the remaining ones ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a particular example of a theory obeying the no - signaling",
    "principle is quantum mechanics .",
    "it was realized , however , that there exist nonsignaling theories which lead to higher violations of bell inequalities than it is allowed by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this discovery raised a debate as to whether such supra - quantum nonsignaling correlations can be found in nature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the nonsignaling correlations is that they are monogamous @xcite .",
    "consider for instance a three - partite scenario in which alice and bob violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite or the chained @xcite bell inequality up to its maximal algebraic value .",
    "then , each of alice s or bob s observables appearing in it can not be correlated with an arbitrary observable measured by eve @xcite .",
    "this fact found important applications in cryptography based on nonsignaling principle @xcite and randomness amplification @xcite  tasks that are impossible in classical world .",
    "although all well - established physical theories satisfy the no - signaling principle , there is at least one important physical phenomenon where monogamy relations can be violated  the black hole information loss problem .",
    "it was argued by almheiri , marolf , polchinski , and sully that if information escapes from black hole , then one can check if the entanglement monogamy is violated @xcite .",
    "later , oppenheim and unruh showed that by performing measurements on three particles in a `` polygamous entangled state '' near black hole , one can send superluminal signals , thus giving rise to a box violating the no - signaling principle .",
    "let us also note that if one allows for post - selection in the bell - type experiment , violation of monogamy relations can appear in quantum mechanics @xcite , which can have applications to black hole information loss problem @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a box violating a monogamy relation .",
    "then , this box must be signaling .",
    "then , the natural question appears : _ how can the box be used to send information from some parties to the other parties , and , moreover , how much communication can be sent ? _ in this letter we answer these questions for three - partite boxes which violate monogamy relations for the chsh and the chained bell inequalities .",
    "we also present a very simple proof of the monogamy relations introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . by putting monogamy relations in a broader framework allows one to get a better understanding of their structure .    before presenting our results ,",
    "we need to introduce some notation and terminology .",
    "imagine that three parties @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 perform a bell - type experiment in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 can measure one of @xmath3 observables , denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , while the external observer @xmath2 measures a single observable , which we also denote by @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that all these observables have two outcomes @xmath6 , denoted @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the correlations that are generated in such an experiment are described by a set of probabilities @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the probability of obtaining @xmath12 when @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 have been measured by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively . in what follows we arrange these probabilities in vectors denoted @xmath13 and refer to them as _",
    "boxes_. we then say that the distribution @xmath14 obeys the no - signaling principle ( it is _ nonsignaling _ ) if all of its marginals describing a subset of parties is independent of the measurement choices made by the remaining parties , i.e. , _",
    "ap(a , b , e|a_i b_j ) & = & _ ap(a , b , e|a_k",
    "b_j ) , and _ bp(a , b , e|a_i b_j ) & = & _ bp(a , b , e|a_i b_k ) , are satisfied for any triple @xmath15 .",
    "then , by @xmath16 we denote the standard bipartite expectation value of the product of observables @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which in general might be conditioned on the third party s measurement choice @xmath19 .",
    "an example of such conditional expectation value is @xmath20 if @xmath21 is nonsignaling , then clearly @xmath22 for any choice of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 .",
    "let us finish the introductory section be defining what we mean by `` classical information '' in the bell - type scenario introduced above .",
    "in this scenario , the parties have access only to measurements of classical random variables associated to observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 . in this sense",
    "the results of the experiments are inherently classical and carry the classical information to which we refer in latter parts of the paper .",
    "for instance , if @xmath0 decides to measure the observable @xmath4 , its result is either @xmath24 or @xmath25 and thus can be encoded in one logical bit .",
    "analogously , a result of the joint measurement of the observables @xmath4,@xmath5 and @xmath2 is can be encoded in tree logical bits .",
    "for clarity we begin our considerations with the simplest scenario of @xmath26 .",
    "the key ingredient of our framework is a simple proof of the monogamy relation obeyed by any nonsignaling probability distribution @xmath21 @xcite : @xmath27 the inequality ( [ monrel ] ) compares the nonlocality shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as measured by the violation of ( [ chsh ] ) , to the ( classical ) correlations that the external party @xmath2 can establish with the outcomes of @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noticed that it remains valid if in the last correlator , @xmath28 is replaced by any @xmath4 or @xmath29 ( for clarity , however , we proceed with a fixed measurement @xmath28 ) .",
    "also , without any loss of generality we can assume that both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are positive ; if this is not the case , we redefine observables @xmath32 , @xmath33 and/or @xmath2 in the following way : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and/or @xmath36 . consequently , in what follows we omit the absolute values in ( [ monrel ] ) .    in order to prove ( [ monrel ] ) , let us first make the following observation .",
    "suppose that for some random variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 taking values @xmath37 there exists the joint probability distribution @xmath38 .",
    "then , the latter fulfils the following inequalities @xmath39 with @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , where addition is modulo 2 . to prove ( [ basicineq ] )",
    ", it suffices to check it for the extremal values of correlators .",
    "now , one notices that each triple of observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 is jointly measurable and therefore , for any pair @xmath42 , there exists the joint probability distribution @xmath43 which must satisfy ( [ lem3 ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to the following four inequalities @xmath44 by summing these up and using the fact that in a nonsignaling theory @xmath45 for any @xmath23 , one obtains .",
    "let us assume that correlators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equal ( later we will show how this assumption can be relaxed ) . then the monogamy relation is well defined .",
    "it bounds the possible correlations achievable in any no - signaling theory between outcomes of measurements performed by the three parties @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". if it is violated by some probability distribution @xmath13 , then the latter must violate the no - signalling principle , in which case we call such a box _ signaling_. in other words , if @xmath13 violates ( [ monrel ] ) , then values of some bipartite correlators become dependent on the measurement choice made by the third party .",
    "this dependence allows one to use such signaling boxes to send information from a single party to the remaining two parties .",
    "to illustrate this idea , suppose that a box @xmath13 violates the relation by @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 then , by adding the inequalities - , one concludes that @xmath50 consequently , in at least one of the three pairs @xmath51 the correlators must differ .",
    "in particular , in one of them the difference must not be lower than @xmath52 .",
    "the correlators in @xmath53 correspond to signaling from @xmath1 to the pair @xmath0 and @xmath2 , while those in @xmath54 to signaling from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .     and @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the random variable @xmath57 corresponds to the choice of measurement by @xmath0 or @xmath1 , while the random variable @xmath58 represents the product of either @xmath4 and @xmath2 or @xmath29 and @xmath2 , depending on the considered pair of correlators .",
    "finally , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the transition probabilities defining the channel.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    let us now assume , without any loss of generality , that [ piq ] a_0 e _ b_0 - a_0 e _",
    "b_1 > 0 , which can be rewritten as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it then follows from ( [ piq ] ) that the probability that the parties @xmath0 and @xmath2 obtain the same results while measuring @xmath32 and @xmath2 , respectively , depends on whether the remaining party measures @xmath28 or @xmath64 .",
    "this gives rise to a binary asymmetric channel , denoted @xmath65 , with the input and output alphabets @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , and the transition probabilities given by ( see fig .",
    "[ ch ] ) @xmath68 importantly , the above reasoning opens the possibility to quantify the communication strength of boxes violating the no - signalling principle by the concept of classical channel capacity .",
    "this is a standard notion in classical information theory which , according to shannon s noisy - channel coding theorem , quantifies the amount of information that a classical channel can transmit per single use @xcite . in particular , the capacity of a binary asymmetric channel with the transition probabilities - can be explicitly written as @xcite : @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the standard binary entropy .",
    "analogously , one associates classical channels to the other two pairs of correlators @xmath71 and @xmath72 . as a result ,",
    "any box violating the monogamy relation ( [ monrel ] ) gives rise to three channels @xmath73 and @xmath74 of capacities    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are probabilities corresponding to the correlators @xmath77 for @xmath56 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it should finally be noticed that a box violating ( [ monrel ] ) might also feature signaling from one or two parties to a single one ; still , by definition , @xmath2 can not signal to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "such situations could , however , make our considerations difficult to handle and in order to avoid them , in what follows we restrict our attention to a subclass of boxes whose all one - partite expectation values @xmath80 with @xmath81 are zero .",
    "let us stress , nevertheless , that this assumption does not influence at all what we have said so far , as , for any box violating ( [ monrel ] ) , there exists another one with exactly the same two - body correlators ( and giving rise to exactly the same channels and the same violation of ( [ monrel ] ) ) whose all one- and three - partite expectation values vanish . precisely , given a probability distribution @xmath14 , the box @xmath82 with @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 etc . , has the same two - body correlators as @xmath14 and all its one - partite and three - partite mean values are zero .",
    "below we then restrict our attention to boxes having only bipartite correlators non - vanishing .",
    "they form a convex set denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "let also @xmath86 be the subset of @xmath85 composed of boxes @xmath13 for which @xmath87 with @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "our aim now is to explore the communication strength of boxes violating ( [ monrel ] ) in terms of capacities of the three associated channels . to this aim",
    ", we will first determine a set of constraints on elements of @xmath86 that fully characterizes correlators giving rise to these channels .",
    "it follows from that @xmath89 and @xmath90 obey the following inequalities @xmath91 replacing eqns . and with eqns . and",
    ", we obtain four non - equivalent sets of four inequalities of the form ( [ nierownosci1])-([nierownosci4 ] ) . by adding them in each of these sets and assuming that ( [ monrel ] ) is violated by @xmath92 $ ] , we arrive at the following inequalities x_b^0 - y_b^0 + x_b^1 - y_b^1 + x_a^1 - y_a^1 & & , [ niert1 ] + x_b^0 + y_b^0 + x_b^1 - y_b^1 - x_a^1 - y_a^1 & & , [ niert2 ] + x_b^0 - y_b^0 + x_b^1 + y_b^1 + x_a^1 + y_a^1 & & , [ niert3 ] + x_b^0 + y_b^0 + x_b^1 + y_b^1 - x_a^1 + y_a^1 & & . [ niert4 ] in appendix we show that for a given @xmath88 $ ] , these inequalities and the trivial conditions @xmath93 are the only restrictions on the two - partite correlators @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , which for further purposes we arrange in a vector @xmath100 . in other words , for any vector of correlators @xmath100 satisfying - there always exists a probability distribution @xmath13 that realizes @xmath100 and violates ( [ monrel ] ) by @xmath101 . on the level of correlators",
    ", this observation gives us a complete characterization of signaling in boxes violating the monogamy ( [ monrel ] ) .",
    "having the above constraints , we are now in position to study the communication properties of boxes violating ( [ monrel ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we will determine the minimal ( nonzero ) amount of information that can be sent from at least one party to the remaining two parties using a box @xmath13 such that @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that for a given @xmath102 one might find a box for which , e.g. , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and , at the same time , there exists a box for which @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath104 , yet they both give rise to the same violation of ( [ monrel ] ) . for this reason we consider the following quantity that depends on the three capacities [ cdefprim ] c_= _ _ \\{c_abe^1,c_bae^0,c_bae^1 } , where , due to what has been previously said , the minimization over @xmath86 can be replaced by a minimization over the polytope @xmath108 of all vectors @xmath100 satisfying - and the trivial conditions @xmath109 .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 tells us that at least one of the three associated channels to any box from @xmath86 has capacity at least @xmath110 .",
    "clearly , @xmath111 and in the case when ( [ monrel ] ) is violated maximally , i.e. , for @xmath112 , @xmath113 can be computed almost by hand and amounts to @xmath114 ( see appendix ) .",
    "for all the intermediate values @xmath102 the problem of determining @xmath110 becomes difficult to handle analytically .",
    "still it can be efficiently computed numerically .",
    "this is because the capacity ( [ cepq ] ) is a convex function in both arguments @xcite and so is the function @xmath115 due to the well - known property that a function resulting from a pointwise maximization of convex functions is also convex .",
    "then , the minimization in ( [ cdefprim ] ) is executed over a convex polytope .",
    "the results of our numerical computations are plotted in fig .",
    "we find that the obtained values of @xmath116 can be realized by boxes obeying the conditions @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and the value of the remaining free parameter @xmath94 is set by the condition @xmath119     of signaling boxes violating the monogamy relation ( [ monrel ] ) by @xmath101 as a function of @xmath101 ( solid line ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath110 grows with @xmath101 , that is , the higher the violation of ( [ monrel ] ) the more information can be sent through the associated channels . for comparison",
    ", we also present the lower bound on @xmath120 given by ( [ gava ] ) for @xmath26 ( dashed line ) and @xmath121 ( dotted line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an exemplary box @xmath14 realizing @xmath110 and satisfying the above conditions is given by @xmath122\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times ( \\delta_{ij,0 } \\delta_{a_i b_j , 0 } + \\delta_{ij,1 } \\delta_{a_i b_j , -1 } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 denotes the kronecker delta , and @xmath94 is the solution of the above equation .",
    "one can see that for this box all one - partite and three - partite expectation values vanish .",
    "moreover , its restriction @xmath124 to the parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equivalent to the so - called popescu - rohrlich box @xcite .",
    "let us conclude by noting that one can also drop the assumption that the correlators @xmath125 and @xmath126 are equal , in which case the monogamy relation reads @xmath127 .",
    "our numerics shows , however , that an addition of this channel in the definition of @xmath110 does not change its value ; in particular , the box ( [ box ] ) realizes @xmath110 and has the property that @xmath128 .",
    "the above considerations can be applied to a monogamy relation for the generalization of the chsh bell inequality to any number of dichotomic measurements at both sites  the chained bell inequality @xcite . to recall the latter and the corresponding monogamy ,",
    "let us assume that now @xmath0 and @xmath1 have @xmath3 dichotomic measurements at their disposal denoted @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "the chained bell inequality reads @xcite : @xmath132 where we use the convention that @xmath133 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it obeys the following simple monogamy relation for any nonsignaling correlations @xmath134 and @xmath135 are nonnegative , and hence , in what follows we omit the absolute values in ( [ chainedeve ] ) .    to proceed with our considerations",
    "we first note that analogously to ( [ monrel ] ) , the monogamy ( [ chainedeve ] ) can be derived from ( [ basicineq ] ) .",
    "precisely , as any three observables @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 are jointly measurable , due to ( [ lem3 ] ) the following set of @xmath136 inequalities @xmath137 and @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 must hold . by adding them and assuming that the no - signaling principle is fulfilled , one obtains ( [ chainedeve ] ) .",
    "it is of importance to point out that the inequalities ( [ nier1 ] ) , ( [ nier2 ] ) , and ( [ nier3 ] ) form a unique minimal set of inequalities of the form ( [ lem3 ] ) that , via the above proof , give rise to the monogamy ( [ chainedeve ] ) . to be more explicit ,",
    "note that any such set must consists of at least @xmath136 inequalities because there are that many different correlators in the bell inequality ( [ chained ] ) .",
    "then , each of these correlators must appear in any such @xmath136-element set with the same sign as in ( [ chained ] ) . as one directly",
    "checks , this is enough to conclude that the only @xmath136-element set is the one given in ineqs .",
    "( [ nier1])-([nier3 ] ) .",
    "let us now assume as before that all correlators appearing in the monogamy relation ( [ chainedeve ] ) do not depend on the the third party s measurements , in particular , @xmath141 for any @xmath142 .",
    "let then @xmath143 be the convex set of boxes for which @xmath144 with @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath48 there must be some signaling between @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 in a box @xmath145 . in particular",
    ", it follows from ( [ nier1 ] ) , ( [ nier2 ] ) , and ( [ nier3 ] ) that @xmath146 where @xmath147 and finally @xmath148 since @xmath48 , this implies that in some of the following @xmath149 pairs ( perhaps all ) @xmath150 with @xmath139 , and @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the correlators must differ .",
    "recall that for the nonsignaling correlations , correlators belonging to each @xmath154 or @xmath155 are equal . in the first case",
    "this means that there is signaling from @xmath0 to @xmath156 , while in the second one , from @xmath1 to @xmath157 .",
    "now , analogously to the case @xmath26 , to each pair of correlators @xmath54 and @xmath158 , can be associated a binary classical channel of capacity @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "we then quantify the communication strength of boxes from @xmath143 by @xmath164 which for @xmath26 reduces to @xmath110 .",
    "similarly to the case @xmath26 , ( [ olot ] ) is not the only inequality bounding the values of the above correlators .",
    "in fact , each of @xmath165 inequalities in ( [ nier3 ] ) remains satisfied if the signs in front of the second and the third correlator are swapped . by concatenating such swaps , one obtains @xmath166 sets of @xmath136 inequalities and each set when summed up produces an analogous inequality to ( [ olot ] ) .",
    "all the resulting inequalities read @xmath167 with @xmath168 for @xmath139 .",
    "although we can not prove it as in the case @xmath26 , we conjecture that all possible values of the correlators in @xmath54 and @xmath158 that satisfy inequalities ( [ elprat ] ) can always be realized with some signaling probability distribution @xmath13 for which @xmath144 . in general , by minimizing @xmath169 over the correlators @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 satisfying ( [ elprat ] ) and the trivial conditions @xmath172 instead of @xmath143 leads to a lower bound on @xmath120 .    in general",
    ", it is a hard task to compute @xmath173 .",
    "still , one can easily bound it from below by noting that @xmath120 majorizes any of the capacities appearing in ( [ definition2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , by consulting ( [ olot ] ) , one finds that at least one pair in @xmath54 or @xmath158 , say @xmath174 , satisfies @xmath175 in terms of probabilities this reads @xmath176 now , the lower bound on @xmath120 is given by the minimum of @xmath177 given the above constraint on @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "using we conclude that for a given value of @xmath101 , the capacity attains the minimum for @xmath180 , for which the corresponding binary channel becomes symmetric whose capacity reads @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , @xmath177 is minimized by @xmath182/2 \\ \\",
    "q^0_b = [ 1- \\delta/(4m-2)]/2,\\ ] ] which leads to [ gava ] c_^m1-h((1+)/2 ) . for large @xmath3",
    "the above lower bound tends to zero and for @xmath26 and @xmath121 it is plotted in fig .",
    "in this work we have shown how signaling correlations violating monogamy relations could be utilized to send classical information between space - like separated observers .",
    "we have also proposed a quantity that allows one to quantify the communication strength of such boxes .",
    "moreover , we presented an alternative proof of certain monogamy relations based on the chsh and the chained bell inequalities , which contrary to the previous ones allows to understand how the no - signaling principle constraints correlations obtained in a bell - type experiment .",
    "on the other hand , our results give some insight into the structure of signaling in correlations that are not monogamous .",
    "in particular we showed that from the violation of these monogamy relations one can infer only about signaling of one party ( say alice ) to the remaining two parties participating in the bell scenario ( bob and eve ) .",
    "let us finally notice that our analysis suggests that there is some trade - off between capacities of the three introduced channels @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "namely , one can satisfy ineqs .",
    "( [ niert1])-([niert4 ] ) with a signaling box for which two channels are of zero capacities , but then the third capacity must be high . in order to lower it , it is necessary to increase the capacity of one of the two remaining channels .",
