    "to date there are only a handful of x - ray binaries that have been detected at high ( he ; 0.1100 gev ) or very high - energies ( vhe ; @xmath2100 gev ) : ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  @xcite , ls5039  @xcite , psr b1259@xmath363 , cyg x@xmath33 @xcite , cyg x@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "recently , two new binaries were found : 1fgl j1018.6@xmath35856 , with a period of 16.6 days found in the gev regime @xcite and hess j0632 + 057 @xcite , for which a period of @xmath4320 days was detected in x - rays ( bongiorno et al .",

    "only ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , ls5039  and psr b1259@xmath363 share the property of being binaries detected at both gev and tev energies .",
    "the other systems have been unambiguously detected only in one band , either at gev or at tev , see , e.g. , the case of cyg x@xmath33 in @xcite . in the case of cyg x@xmath31 , with the hint of tev detection itself being at the level of 4 standard deviations ( 4@xmath5 ) , claims of detection at gev energies by the astrorivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile ) remain uncertain with concurrent  large area telescope ( lat ) observations @xcite .",
    "it is yet uncertain whether these spectral energy distribution ( sed ) differences reflect an underlying distinct nature , or are just a variability signature in different bands .",
    "the nature of the binary compact object in ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , ls5039 , hess j0632 + 057 and 1fgl j1018.6@xmath35856 is as yet undetermined @xcite .",
    "both neutron star ( e.g. psr b1259@xmath363 ) and probable black hole ( e.g. cyg x@xmath33 ) binary systems have been detected at gev energies and so both types of compact object are viable in the undetermined systems .",
    "recently the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard swift reported a magnetar - like event which may have emanated from ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  @xcite .",
    "if true this would be the first magnetar found in a binary system .",
    "the early lat reports of gev emission from ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  were based upon 69 months of survey observations @xcite .",
    "both sources were detected at high significance and were unambiguously identified with the binaries by their flux modulation at the corresponding orbital periods , 26.4960 days for ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  @xcite and 3.90603 days for ls5039  @xcite .",
    "the modulation patterns were roughly consistent with expectations from inverse compton scattering plus @xmath1-@xmath1 absorption models , and were anti - correlated in phase with pre - existing tev measurements .",
    "the anti - correlation of gev  tev fluxes is in fact a generic feature of these models , where the gev emission is enhanced ( reduced ) when the highly relativistic electrons seen by the observer encounter the seed photons head - on ( rear - on ) ; .",
    "-lat measurements provided a confirmation of these predictions .",
    "the spectra of both sources were best modeled with exponential cutoffs in their high - energy spectra , at least along part of the orbit .",
    "specifically , an exponential cutoff was statistically a better fit to the sed compared with a pure power law at phases surrounding the superior conjunction ( supc ) of ls5039and in the orbitally averaged spectrum of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 . statistical limitations of the data prevented the determination or the ruling out of an exponential cutoff in any part of the orbit of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  or in the inferior conjunction ( infc ) of ls5039 .",
    "the spectral energy distributions with the exponential cutoffs that were reported were reminiscent of the many pulsars the lat has detected since launch @xcite , although this was far from a proof of their pulsar nature . to date no pulsations have been found at gev energies , or at any other wavelengths , despite deep dedicated searches ( see e.g. , rea et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "since  was launched , both the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov telescopes ( magic ) and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array ( veritas ) have performed observations of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , simultaneous and archival data from long - term monitoring of radio and h@xmath6 emission is available for comparison in a multi - wavelength context . in this work we present the results of the analysis of 30 months of lat survey observations of both ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  and ls5039 .",
    "we investigate the long - term flux variations of the sources , as well as variations in the amplitude of their orbital flux modulation , and we explore the possible spectral variability for both systems , finally putting and interpreting these observations in the context of the source behavior at other frequencies .",

    "the  survey mode operations began on 2008 august 4 ; in this mode , the observatory is rocked north and south on alternate orbits to provide a more uniform coverage , so that every part of the sky is usually observed for @xmath430 minutes every @xmath43 hours . therefore , the two sources of interest were monitored regularly without significant breaks , allowing us to draw a complete picture of their behavior in @xmath1-rays over the last two years .",
    "the dataset used for this analysis spans 2008 august 4 through 2011 january 24 .",

    "were applied to the data @xcite .",

    "time periods when the target source was observed at a zenith angle greater than 105@xmath8 were excluded to limit contamination from earth limb photons . where required in the analysis , models for the galactic diffuse emission ( _ gll_iem_v02.fit _ ) and isotropic backgrounds ( _ isotropic_iem_v02.txt _ ) were used .",
    "the binned maximum - likelihood method of gtlike , included in the sciencetools , was used to determine the intensities and spectral parameters presented in this paper .",

    "for source modeling , the 1fgl catalog @xcite , derived from 11 months of survey data , and the first _ fermi _ pulsar catalog @xcite were used ; all sources within 15@xmath8 of the roi center were included .",
    "the energy spectra of point sources included in the catalog within our roi are modeled by a simple power law , @xmath10 with the exception of known @xmath1-ray pulsars , which were modeled by power laws with exponential cutoffs described by : @xmath11 .",

    "the flux normalization was left free .",
    "all of the spectral parameters of the two subject binaries were left free for the fit .",
    "source detection significance is determined using the test statistic value , @xmath12 which compares the likelihood ratio of models including , e.g. , an additional source , with the null - hypothesis of background only @xcite .    to estimate the systematic errors , which are mainly caused by uncertainties in the effective area and energy response of the lat as well as background contamination , we use the so - called  bracketing \" irfs .",
    "these are irfs with effective areas that bracket those of our nominal irf above and below by linearly connecting differences of ( 10% , 5% , 20% ) at log(e / mev ) of ( 2 , 2.75 , 4 ) respectively .",
    "lightcurves are extracted using aperture photometry , taking an aperture radius of 1@xmath8 and using the gtbin tool .",

    "[ sec : ls_av_spec ] , [ sec : lsi_av_spec ] ) .",
    "these lightcurves are not background subtracted .",
    "the folded lightcurves shown in the subsequent sections are derived by performing gtlike fits for each phase bin .",
    "therefore , all of them are effectively background subtracted .",
    "we check that both methods for generating lightcurves , aperture photometry and gtlike fits , are consistent with each other when the former lightcurves are background - subtracted too .    the primary method of timing analysis employed searches for periodic modulation by calculating the weighted periodogram of the lightcurve .",
    "the lightcurve is constructed by summing , for each photon , the estimated probability that the photon came from the source of interest .",
    "the probability will be both spatially and spectrally dependent . because this technique allows for the correct weighting of each photon it intrinsically improves the signal - to - noise and allows the use of a larger aperture .",
    "this method has successfully been applied to increasing the lat sensitivity for the detection of pulsars @xcite . however , in the basic form of this technique , the weight for any particular energy / position is fixed .",
    "this means that changes in source brightness will not be reflected in the weights and can result in incorrect probabilities .",
    "the calculation of probabilities was performed using the tool gtsrcprob and the same source model file derived from the 1fgl catalog and used in the spectral analysis .",
    "since the exposure of the time bins was variable , the contribution of each time bin to the power spectrum was weighted based on its relative exposure .",
    "period errors are calculated using the method of @xcite .",
    "ls5039  is located in a complicated region toward the inner galaxy with high galactic diffuse emission and many surrounding @xmath1-ray sources . in particular , the lat detected a bright ( @xmath13 above 100  mev ) @xmath1-ray pulsar , psr  j1826@xmath31256 , @xmath14 away from ls5039 . following the analysis performed in the earlier lat paper @xcite we discarded events",
    "whose arrival times correspond to the peaks of the pulsar cycle of psr  j1826@xmath31256 in order to minimize the contamination from the pulsar .",
    "the excluded pulse phase of psr  j1826@xmath31256 is @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig . 37 in @xcite ) , which results in a loss of 30% exposure on ls 5039 . to account for the loss , a scaling factor of @xmath17",
    "is multiplied to fluxes obtained with maximum likelihood fits .",
    "the orbitally - averaged spectrum of ls5039  was initially investigated by fitting a power law and a power law with an exponential cutoff to the data .",
    "we compare two models utilizing the likelihood ratio test @xcite , i.e. for the ratio @xmath18 we assume a @xmath19-distribution to calculate the probabilities taking into account the corresponding degrees of freedom @xcite . in this case , the significance of a spectral cutoff was assessed by comparing the likelihood ratio between the power law and cutoff power law cases , which is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the likelihood value obtained for the spectral fits with a power law and a cutoff power law , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the simple power law model is rejected at the 9.7@xmath5 level in favor of the cutoff power law .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the cutoff power law model are @xmath23 and @xmath24  gev with a flux of @xmath25 integrated above 100  mev . using a cutoff power - law spectral model , the maximum likelihood fit yields a test statistic of ts = 1623 for the ls5039  detection ; equivalent to @xmath26 .",
    "we also tried a broken power - law spectral model for ls5039  in addition to an exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "we found the broken power law gives lower ts values than the exponentially cutoff power - law case .",
    "spectral points in each energy band were obtained by dividing the dataset into separate energy bins and performing maximum likelihood fits for each of them . the resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "is plotted in figure  [ fig : ls5039_spectra ] together with the best - fit cutoff power law model .",
    "interestingly , the sed shows significantly higher flux ( one spectral data point ) at @xmath27  gev than the expected flux from the best - fit cutoff power law , possibly suggesting another component at high energies .",
    "one idea explored for these sources ( especially , for ls5039 , see e.g. , torres 2010 ) is that the @xmath1-ray emission could be understood as having two components : one would be the magnetospheric gev emission from a putative pulsar and the other from the inter - wind region or from the pulsar wind zone .",
    "the latter would be unpulsed and would vary with the orbital phase , the former would be steady and pulsed .",
    "the current data for ls5039  would indeed allow for this possibility , especially because of the possible high energy component found in the gev spectrum .    to test the significance of the additional component",
    ", we added to the model a power - law source at the location of ls5039  in addition to the cutoff power law source .",
    "model a is a power law with a cutoff and model b a power law with a cutoff plus an additional power law .",

    "being consistent with our previous paper , the power - law assumption for the supc spectrum is rejected with @xmath38 , or at a rejection significance of @xmath39 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath40 , @xmath41  gev , and @xmath42 .",

    "the limited statistics and the large contribution of diffuse emission at low energies , however , prevents solid conclusions on whether a more complicated fit ( e.g.  a double broken power law or a broken power law with a cutoff ) would be preferred .",
    "we also searched for emission from the high - energy component in the supc and infc spectra .",

    "the longer term trends are evident by looking at a plot of the 3-orbit rolling average ( black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital_lc_time_lsi ] ) . during the first eight orbits the flux decreases by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "then , in march 2009 , the flux appears to increase over the course of several orbits ; we take the transition point of this increase to be mjd 54900 .",
    "the flux increases significantly by 33@xmath484% , rising from a baseline of @xmath61 obtained from the first 8 months of data to @xmath62 which is the average flux of the remaining 1.7 years of the data . comparing the flux levels averaged over the same time span , 8 months before and 8 months after the flux change",
    ", we obtain a @xmath440% increase . after this",
    "flux change the flux decreases again slowly over the remaining 1.7 years .",
    "the complexities of the short timescale , orbit - to - orbit variability make it impossible to characterise the exact properties of the transition from the ` lower ' to ` higher ' flux states .",
    "the transition likely took place over several orbits , however , for simplicity throughout the remainder of this analysis we use a transition time of mjd 54900 .",
    "we graphically show the flux change in figure  [ fig : before_after ] , by plotting the folded lightcurves before and after the transition in march 2009 .",
    "the data points are folded on the @xcite period , with zero phase at mjd 43,366.775 . before the transition ,",
    "the modulation was clearly seen and is compatible with the already published phasogram , whereas afterwards , the amplitude of the modulation diminishes .",
    "we quantify this behavior by measuring the flux fraction below .",
    "note that the datasets corresponding to the reported results @xcite and what we here referred to as _ before the flux change _ span almost exactly the same time range , with the consequence of our current analysis essentially reproducing that previously published .",
    "the time span covered by our earlier publication coincidentally finished just prior to the onset of the flux change .",
    "the spectra derived before and after this flux change are shown in figure  [ fig : before_after ] , where the increase in flux is also obviously visible .",
    "the statistics of the current dataset allow us to divide the orbit in different phase ranges and to compute the corresponding spectra for different phase bins .",
    "we have divided the orbit into infc and supc phase ranges in two different ways .",
    "first , we have split the ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  orbit in two halves based on its geometry , as visualized , for instance in aragona et al .",
    "the supc phase range is defined as from phase 0.63 to phase 0.13 ; infc is defined correspondingly , as the remaining half .",
    "we also adopted another way to separate between infc and supc based on the angle between the compact object , the star , and the observer .",
    "therefore , the orbit is not divided in two halves in this way , but in one piece when the compact object is in front of the star ( corresponding to infc ) : 0.244  0.507 ; and in another phase range with the same duration , centering at the exact supc phase : 0.981  0.244 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : orbital_cuts ] , the spectra obtained with the different cuts",
    "do not differ significantly and all spectral parameters are compatible within their corresponding errors ( see table  [ table : fit ] ) .",
    "we find that the flux difference between infc and supc is of order of 20% .",
    "for these different datasets , representing only portions of the orbit , we modeled the source with a pure power law and with a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "the @xmath63 value comparing both fits for the angular based cut is 108 ( infc ) , which means that the probability of incorrectly rejecting a power law with respect to an an exponential cutoff is @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . for supc",
    "the @xmath63 value is 97 , which leads to a probability of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) to wrongly reject the cutoff power law .",
    "hence , the exponential cutoff is preferred over the pure power law also for two parts of the orbit , namely infc or supc .",
    "we have also divided the orbit into phase ranges corresponding to periastron ( half of the orbit around phase 0.275 ) and apastron ( the other half , around phase 0.725 ) , based just on the distance between the compact object and the star . in this case , neither a significant difference between the flux values for the two phase bins nor a difference in the spectral shape is visible .",
    "these results can also be seen in figure  [ fig : orbital_cuts ] .",
    "this is probably the result of dividing the orbit into phase ranges which contain both bin phases corresponding to infc and supc .",
    "we also studied the spectral behavior of the source in phase bins of 0.1 . for this study we modeled ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  with a power law with cutoff for each phase - bin individually .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained are shown in figure  [ fig : lsi_modulation ] . note that we fixed in the model the index at 2.07 to study the orbital behavior of the cutoff energy and we fixed the cutoff energy at 3.9gev to study the behavior of the index , since both parameters are correlated .",
    "these values are , respectively , the results arising from the fit over the whole dataset . a clear orbital modulation of the flux and spectral shape are seen . through the periastron passage",
    "the spectrum gets softer and the flux is maximum , whereas around apastron the spectrum becomes harder and the flux reaches its minimum .",
    "both the orbitally - averaged spectrum and the spectra of the several datasets mentioned were also fit with a broken power law , in addition to the pure and exponentially cutoff power law .",
    "all the @xmath47 values for the different fits are listed in table  [ table : ts ] .",
    "it is evident that the power law with an exponential cutoff or the broken power law always describe the spectral shape better than a pure power law does . to be precise ,",
    "when comparing the exponentially cutoff with the pure power law , the @xmath68  values span the range from 90 to 520 ; with the former being always statistically preferred . fitting a broken power law",
    "gives almost the same results .",
    "the @xmath68  values span the range from 77 to 494 and we find break energies in the range of 0.4 to 1.7gev .",
    "all of the fits to the various data sets with an exponentially cutoff power law have slightly better @xmath47 values with fewer degrees of freedom than a broken power law suggesting that the former model is a better description of the data than the latter one .",
    "the exponentially cutoff power law describes nicely the curvature of the spectrum especially at low energies . at higher energies , above the spectral break",
    ", the broken power law fits all the spectral points , even the highest one which might be considered possibly part of a second component .",
    "statistically we can not distinguish which of these two fitting models describes best the data as a whole , but only that both of them are preferred over a pure power law .",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  has also been monitored with the _ rxte_proportional counter array ( pca ) and folded lightcurves were produced using the same ephemeris as described in section  [ change ] . in the left panel of figure [ fig : multi ]",
    ", we show a direct comparison between the phasograms in x - ray and in @xmath1-rays , with simultaneously taken data .",
    "we divide the whole lat dataset into five periods of six months each and compare them with correspondingly obtained pca x - ray data .",
    "the division in periods of 6-months is justified in order to have enough statistics in @xmath1-rays for each individual time bin , and such that orbit - to - orbit x - ray variability does not dominate the flux fraction changes .    for _ rxte_-pca",
    ", we have used the `` standard 2 '' mode for spectral analysis .",
    "data reduction was performed using heasoft 6.9 .",
    "we select time intervals where the source elevation above earth limb is @xmath69 and the pointing offset is @xmath70 .",
    "pca background lightcurves and spectra were generated using the ftools task pcabackest .",
    "pcarsp was used to generate pca response matrices for spectra .",
    "the background file used in analysis of pca data is the most recent available from the heasarc website for faint sources , and detector breakdown events have been removed . a power law shape , with absorbing hydrogen column density fixed at @xmath71 @xmath72 ,",
    "was used to fit the standard 2 data , with the following function @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalization at 1 kev , @xmath5 is the photoelectric cross section and @xmath6 is the photon index .",
    "it is apparent that the x - ray modulation is always visible in each of these five panels , albeit with variable amplitude of flux modulation .",
    "we define the flux fraction as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the maximum and minimum flux in the 310 kev found in the orbital profile analyzed ( after background subtraction ) .",
    "the modulation becomes even stronger over time and stays stable over the last 3 half year bins .",
    "instead , at gev energies , the lat data indicate that the modulated fraction fades away until the variability along the orbit is barely visible in the last 6 months of our data , which is consistent with figure [ fig : lsi_varying_power ] . the flux fraction is plotted in the right - top panel of figure [ fig : multi ] .",
    "the difference between the behavior of the x - ray and the @xmath1-ray emission is clearly visible . in the right - bottom panel of figure [ fig : multi ]",
    "we show the average @xmath1- and x - ray fluxes fitted in each of the periods considered .",
    "we checked for a possible appearance of the super - orbital periodicity 1667@xmath488 days , taking zero phase at mjd 43366.275 and the shape of the outburst peak flux modulation estimated by @xcite in radio by considering the flux evolution and the direct count rate , using the full dataset of the pca observations .",
    "we find no evidence of the super - orbital period in x - ray or @xmath1-rays , which is not surprising given the short integration time in comparison with the super - orbital period duration .",
    "we have also compared the lat - obtained data with radio and h@xmath6 observations . for the latter , we first take into account the results contained in the long - term coverage presented by .",
    "these authors have already shown that the equivalent width ( ew ) and the peak separation of the h@xmath6 emission line appear to vary with the super - orbital radio period of @xmath78 days , this being likely the result of cyclical variations in the mass - loss rate of the be companion and/or of density variability in the circumstellar disk .",
    "proposed that the variability in the ew(h@xmath6 ) can be explained by a cyclical change in the mass - loss rate of about 25% over its average value .",
    "this mechanism would imply changes in the density of the circumstellar disc in the same range .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1-ray lightcurve would have a similar behavior to that found for the ew(h@xmath6 ) would imply that the former is related to the circumstellar disc surrounding the be star",
    ". this would naturally be the case if the @xmath1-rays are produced in an inter - wind shock formed by the collision of outflows from the compact object and the star itself .",
    "and @xcite discussed how the many uncertainties present in our knowledge of the ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  system influence the models for producing @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "one of the important parameters is the density and size ( and the possible truncation ) of the circumstellar disc .",
    "the latter influence the position of the inter - wind shock , and the time intervals along the orbit in which the compact object outflow may be balanced by the equatorial wind feeding it , and/or when the compact object is directly within the circumstellar disc itself . for recent measurements on very long - term optical variability of be high mass x - ray binaries in the small magellanic cloud see @xcite .",
    "we plot in figure [ radio - comp ] a comparison of the lat data , folded on the super - orbital radio period , with the radio data compiled by gregory ( 1999 )  most of it obtained at 8.3 ghz , using the green bank interferometer  and the ew of the h@xmath6 line obtained by .",
    "care should be exercised when comparing our lat data with the radio data in , since the latter authors used the ephemeris given by @xcite , for which the combination of the phase and peak flux density yielded a best - modulation period of 1584 days .",
    "this super - orbital period was later revised by @xcite to the current value of 1667 days .",
    "this latter value is the super - orbital period that we have used to fold the x - ray and lat data , and we use it also here for the radio and h@xmath6 emission .",
    "the comparison is clearly non - contemporaneous , and this may induce problems in the interpretation of a source like ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , presenting different variability phenomenology .",
    "we do not see any clear correlation or anti - correlation with the radio and h@xmath6 fluxes which may be hidden by the scarcity of gev data .    we have also compared the fermi data with simultaneous radio data from the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) array ( cambridge , uk ) . since the launch of fermi in june 2008 ,",
    "the ovro 40 m single - dish telescope , that is located in california ( usa ) , has conducted a regular monitoring program of galactic binaries ( e.g. cyg x@xmath33 , @xcite ) .",
    "the ovro flux densities are measured in a single 3ghz wide band centered on 15ghz . a complete description of the ovro 40 m telescope and calibration strategy can be found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also use complementary observations provided by ami , consisting of a set of eight 13 m antennas with a maximum baseline of @xmath4 120 m .",
    "ami observations are conducted with a 6ghz bandwidth receivers also centered at 15ghz .",
    "see @xcite for more details on the ami interferometer , that is mostly used for study of the cosmic microwave background . by folding these radio data",
    "no super - orbital modulation could be seen , which could be due to the poor coverage of a whole super - orbit .",
    "a direct comparison of the gev and the radio data is shown in figure  [ fig : whole_data_lc_lsi ] where the flux over time is plotted .",
    "no correlation of the data points can be seen either . in summary",
    ", we did not find any correlation between the gev and the radio band , either in archived nor in simultaneous data .",
    "after analyzing a dataset comprising 2.5-years of -lat observations of the two binaries ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , we note several changes with respect to the initial reports of @xcite .",
    "these were produced either because the accumulation of a longer observation time allowed us to make distinctions that were earlier impossible ( valid for both sources ) , or because the behavior of the source changed ( valid for ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 ) .",
    "on one hand , the statistics are now sufficient to divide the dataset of both sources in infc and supc and to show that a power law with a cutoff describes the spectra obtained in both conjunctions better than a pure power law .",
    "the cutoff is similar to that found in the many other gev pulsars discovered by -lat .",
    "however , we have found that both ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  show an excess of the high energy gev emission beyond what is expected from an exponentially cutoff power law . while the high energy data are significantly in excess of the exponentially cutoff power law there are insufficient statistics at these high energies to model the excess with an additional spectral component .",
    "the process(es ) generating such a component in the case of ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is unclear and may even be different in the two sources .",
    "however , such a second component would present a possible connection between the gev and tev spectra in both sources . collecting more data and",
    "therefore more statistics will allow to prove or discard it in the future .",
    "the lack of datapoints at high energies , also affects , particularly in the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , the distinction between an exponentially cut and a broken power law .",
    "currently , both are certainly preferred over a pure power law , but differences in the significances provided between the former are minor .    we have noted that whereas ls5039  shows stable emission over time and also a stable orbital modulation , ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  shows a change in flux in march 2009 . afterwards the orbital modulation decreases ( see the bottom - most left panels of figure [ fig : multi ] ) and the orbital period could not be detected in the gev data .",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  has also presented a complex , concurrent behavior at higher energies . at tev , for approximately the last two years , it seems to have been in a low state in comparison with the flux level that led to its discovery @xcite .",
    "additionally , it was detected once after 4.2hrs of observations near the periastron , where the system was never seen at tev energies before @xcite . both of these aspects of the ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  phenomenology as well as",
    "the phase location of the tev maxima in general would require modifications of simple inverse compton models in the scenarios usually put forward for the source .",
    "the idea of a magnetar compact object in ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is suggested by @xcite to explain the changing tev behavior of this object and could potentially describe the diminishing orbital modulation now observed at gev fluxes .",
    "however , as explained by @xcite , detailed numerical simulations are required to verify if this scenario can accurately reproduce the observed gev and tev emission .",
    "the lower - energy , multi - wavelength picture of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is still unclear with the orbital modulation in gev ( x - ray ) fading ( increasing ) with time .",
    "because the gev data do not cover a whole super - orbital period , a conclusion about the possible relationship of the gev emission with the super - orbital behavior of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  can not be drawn yet . continued",
    "monitoring of the source with the -lat will allow the study such long - term cycles , if any .",
    "zamanov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that if the @xmath44yr modulation in radio and h@xmath6 is due to changes in the circumstellar disk density , it could be detected in x- or @xmath1-rays as well , since the high energy emission of a putative neutron star depends on the density of the surrounding matter with which it interacts .",
