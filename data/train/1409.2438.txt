    "theoretical descriptions of @xmath0-meson decays into exclusive light final states often invoke a non - local matrix element in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) between the @xmath0 state and the vacuum , see e.  g.  @xcite . since the light final states recoil with considerable energy against the @xmath0 meson at rest ( at least in some regions of the phase space ) , the non - locality of the operator is light - like .",
    "the most important of such objects is called the leading light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) , defined as @xcite @xmath2 n\\hspace{-4.8pt}/ \\gamma_5 h({0})|b\\rangle \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the @xmath0-meson decay constant in hqet , and the vector @xmath4 is light - like .",
    "( there also exists another lcda within the 2-particle fock - state description of the @xmath0 meson , called @xmath5 , which can be discussed similarly . )",
    "the fourier transform of this function , @xmath6 is commonly used as @xmath7 represents the @xmath8-projection of the light - quark s momentum .",
    "this function is principally a non - perturbative input that enters factorization theorems and thus not calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "however , it is possible to calculate both its moments over a large enough intervall using an operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , as well as its dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath9 , which has been suppressed in the notation so far .",
    "let us first consider the latter point : the @xmath9-dependence is gouverned by the integro - differential renormalization - group equation ( rge ) @xcite @xmath10    \\phi_b^+(\\omega ) \\nnb \\\\    & & - \\omega \\int\\limits_0^\\infty d\\eta \\,\\gamma(\\omega,\\eta ) \\,\\phi_b^+(\\eta ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term in this equation mixes different regions in @xmath7 when evolving in @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the solution to this equation requires us to integrate over the full @xmath7 region of the lcda at the initial scale .",
    "however , as was discouvered recently the above operation possesses a continuous set of eigenfunctions @xcite @xmath11 with the parameter @xmath12 of mass dimension 1 , called the dual momentum .",
    "the analogon for light mesons are the gegenbauer polynomials @xcite . a suitable representation of the lcda is therefore given by a linear combination of the eigenfunctions , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is now analogous to the gegenbauer coefficients in the comparison with light mesons above .",
    "the relation ( [ eq:3 ] ) can be inverted using the orthogonality relations of besselfunctions and reads @xmath15 as a result the so - defined dual ) of the common model @xmath16 results in @xmath17 , which features a `` dual '' behaviour : whereas @xmath18 falls off exponentially for large @xmath7 and vanishes linearly at the origin , @xmath14 vanishes exponentially for small @xmath12 and as a first inverse power for large @xmath12 . ]",
    "lcda renormalizes locally , @xmath19 \\rho_b^+(\\omega')\\;,\\ ] ] with the rather simple solution @xmath20 here the hatted quantity @xmath21 denotes a rescaled dual momentum , and the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 involve integrals over the anomalous dimensions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , see e.  g.  @xcite for details .",
    "qualitatively the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain the same information ; constraints on one of them translate to constraints on the other .",
    "it is well known that the lcda @xmath18 does not fall rapidly enough to have a norm . in other words , the bare matrix element in ( [ eq:1 ] ) requires an extra subtraction in the local limit .",
    "since moments over an infinite interval are therefore not defined , one must introduce an ultra - violet cutoff @xmath28 , on which moments depend logarithmically .",
    "such moments , @xmath29 have been calculated in an operator product expansion in @xmath30 to first order corrections as @xcite    @xmath31\\;.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2 when expressing the above in dual space we find a weighted integral over all dual momenta @xmath32 where the first few weight functions are @xmath33 \\;.\\nnb\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they primarilly probe the dual lcda in the region @xmath34 , and since @xmath35 we can infer the functional dependence of @xmath27 in the region @xmath36 as an expansion in @xmath37 modulo logarithms .",
    "we find up to second - order power corrections @xmath38",
    "so far we note that the large @xmath12 behaviour of @xmath27 is @xmath37 .",
    "this finding and the solution ( [ eq:6 ] ) seem incompatible and leads us to contemplate the following dilemma : suppose two model builders , @xmath39 and @xmath0 , are given the task to create a model for @xmath27 at two different scales , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , with @xmath42 .",
    "both feature an asymptotic @xmath37 tail . but according to ( [ eq:6 ] ) the tail of the first model , @xmath43 , will pick up a softening contribution as we evolve from one scale to the next , and scales like @xmath44 at the scale of the second builder . are both models therefore incompatible ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that we are comparing two different regions in @xmath12 . whereas @xmath43 has a @xmath45 behaviour around @xmath46 and indeed evolves to a softer @xmath47 dependence in this @xmath48 regime",
    ", we then compare it to the @xmath49 regime .",
    "+ let us therefore use standard resummation techniques by introducing an auxiliary scale @xmath50 that scales like @xmath12 for large @xmath51 and does not become small as @xmath12 becomes small , for example @xmath52 .",
    "the latter aspect has no relevance to our discussion at hand , but was chosen so that we can avoid the landau pole in @xmath53 when discussing the low @xmath12 regime later on . from ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath54 this equation allows us to state that the dual lcda is perturbatively calculable in resummed perturbation theory for the entire region @xmath55 @xcite . to see how the above puzzle is resolved",
    "it helps to consider the function @xmath56 the essence of this definition is that if @xmath57 as @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 a constant ) , then @xmath60 .",
    "we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 collects terms of order @xmath64 and power corrections .",
    "therefore @xmath65 asymptotically for large @xmath12 as shown in figure  1 .",
    "+   figure 1 : depiction of the function @xmath66 at @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 .",
    "+ since @xmath69 ( which follows from equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) exactly ) integrates to @xmath70 we see that @xmath71 or @xmath72 for @xmath73 , irrespective of how large @xmath74 becomes .    the finding that @xmath27 falls towards zero with an ever increasing rate",
    "since @xmath75 is a monotoneously growing function in @xmath12 leads to a new insight , to wit that the phenomenologically important first inverse moment of the lcda , @xmath76 see below , exists at all scales @xmath9 .",
    "( in fact , we can even state that any positive moment of @xmath27 exists , since @xmath75 grows with no boundary . )",
    "previous analyses of the lcda @xcite stated solutions for the rg evolution that broke down as the spread between initial scale @xmath40 and final scale @xmath74 becomes so large that @xmath77 , as manifest in factors involving @xmath78 and similar functions .",
    "we now understand that these perceived thresholds are not physical and disappear once a resummation for large values of @xmath12 is included .",
    "in the previous narrative we have discussed the function @xmath79 for values of @xmath55 , which is the perturbative regime . for small values of @xmath12 , however , non - perturbative physics are dominant . in the absence of other information from non - perturbative theoretical methods and experimental input , one is forced to model @xmath79 in this region . to our knowledge there is no theorem stating that the original lcda @xmath80 or even the dual @xmath79 shall be positive definite , and therefore adopted models can differ greatly . in the paper of which",
    "these proceedings report @xcite we have designed a recipe that allows for the smooth merging of a given model in the low @xmath12 region and the perturbative findings of the previous section , while respecting the moment constraints in ( [ eq : momentconstraint ] ) .",
    "this construction is based on an expansion of the model in a set of basis functions with apropriate characteristics . for details",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper .",
    "the first inverse moment of the lcda  and logarithmic modulations of it  are of particular interest to phenomenology .",
    "the factorized amplitude of the exclusive @xmath81 in the low @xmath82 region , for example , requires knowledge of the quantities @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is of mass dimension 1 and @xmath85 are numbers with @xmath86 .",
    "similarly we may define inverse moments in dual space as @xmath87 it was shown that the first few of these dual moments are identical to the original ones @xcite , namely @xmath88 for higher @xmath89 linear combinations appear . since we already know the integrand in ( [ eq:16 ] ) for @xmath90 we may separate this region out and simply calculate it .",
    "the integral over the remaining , non - perturbative part , @xmath91 , can be rewritten by substituting @xmath92 to form @xmath93 we may further expand the unknown function @xmath27 in terms of laguerre polynomials @xmath94 , i.  e. @xmath95 the advantage of this decomposition is that we may be able to fit the first few coefficients @xmath96 from precise experimental data @xcite .",
    "the above use of laguerre polynomials allows us to relate @xmath97 in conclusion we find that at this point in time the most promissing way to gain further insight into the non - perturbative part of the lcda is to increase the precision of experimental data from exclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "whether theoretical methods like sum rules and lattice qcd can lead to more information on the lcda is an interesting question .",
    "in this talk we have summarized some aspects on the recently found dual lcda of the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "the biggest advantage of this description results from the fact that it renormalizes locally , i.  e.  does not mix different regions in its argument @xmath12 under rg evolution .",
    "the region of large @xmath12 is determined by way of a short - distance operator product expansion of moments over the original lcda , and thus perturbatively calculable .",
    "we have demonstrated this by calculating @xmath79 in this regime to first - order qcd corrections and first - order power corrections .",
    "we advocate the use of the dual lcda in factorization theorems as it simplifies the rg analysis of the factorized amplitude greatly .",
    "we paid particular attention to the tail of the dual lcda , @xmath98 , and demonstrated that resummation of large logarithms of the form @xmath99 renders the solution valid at any ( and even unphysically large ) renormalization scale .",
    "wherelse other formalisms break down where the rg - evolution function @xmath22 assumes integer values , our representation does not .",
    "we might be preempt in the notion that an impression exists , that an increased precision in power corrections to the moments over the original lcda ( [ eq : momentconstraint ] ) leads ultimately to a prediction of the phenomenologically important quantity @xmath84 , but we stress that this is not so .",
    "it would only lead to a more precise determination of the dual lcda in the large @xmath12 regime , but not determine @xmath84 and its logarithmic modulations . on an intuitive level this statement",
    "can be justified by the fact that the large @xmath100-quark mass has been eliminated in hqet at leading power ; on a technical level it is justified by a very slow point - wise convergence in the low-@xmath12 region when expanding around the large-@xmath12 behaviour . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper .",
    "a similar treatment concerning the shape function of inclusive @xmath0 decays is possible .",
