    "the detection of photons emitted by an extrasolar planet is a landmark feat in the history of astronomy .",
    "ten years after the initial discovery of the first extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) 51 peg b @xcite , @xcite report a dectection of infrared flux from tres-1  and @xcite report a similar detection for hd209458b .",
    "both observations were made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ as each planet passed behind its parent star . while a number of papers have aimed at predicting the optical and infrared spectra of hot egps @xcite , these results are the first infrared detections ( rather than upper limits ) that can be compared with models .",
    "tres-1 , discovered by @xcite , is similar to the well - known planet hd209458b",
    "@xcite in mass and orbital period but it receives less stellar irradiation and has a significantly smaller radius .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have recently placed tighter constraints on the planet s mass and radius by improving our knowledge of the physical parameters of the parent star .",
    "tres-1  and hd209458b  are members of the class of `` pegasi planets '' ( or `` hot jupiters '' ) that orbit their parent stars at less than @xmath3  0.1 au and are presumed to be tidally locked . unlike brown dwarfs of similar effective temperature , the luminosity of pegasi planets is dominated by absorbed and re - radiated stellar flux , rather than intrinsic luminosity due to cooling of its interior .",
    "atmospheric dynamics will redistribute this absorbed energy around the planet with an efficiency that is currently unknown @xcite . because of the dominance of absorbed flux over intrinsic flux , the planet s effective temperature @xmath4 , is equal to its equilibrium temperature , @xmath5 , given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is 1 if the absorbed radiation is able to be radiated away over the entire planet ( @xmath8 steradians ) or 2 if it only radiates on the day side ( @xmath9 steradians ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the planet s bond albedo , @xmath11 is the luminosity of the star , @xmath2 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 is the planet s orbital distance .",
    "@xcite used the infrared array camera ( irac ) aboard _ spitzer _ to observe the emission of the combined tres-1  planet / star system .",
    "the timing of the observations included time before , during , and after the secondary eclipse ( when the planet s light is blocked by the star ) .",
    "the observations were performed simultaneously in bands 2 and 4 , centered on 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the planet+star system was indeed brighter in both bands when the planet was visible , indicating thermal emission from the planet was detected .",
    "the observed eclipse depths , in units of relative flux , were 0.00066 @xmath13 0.00013 at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 0.00225 @xmath13 0.00036 at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "the hd209458b  observations by @xcite utilized this same method , except that their observation used the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) instrument at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "the observed flux ratio was 0.00260 @xmath13 0.00046 .    from their observations",
    "@xcite derived brightness temperatures in each of the two bands , @xmath14 k and @xmath15 k. it is important to notice that @xmath16 , which was not predicted by models of pegasi planets cited above , nor for brown dwarfs of similar @xmath4 @xcite , nor is it observed in the mid infrared spectra of brown dwarfs to date @xcite .",
    "@xcite also derive a planetary @xmath17 k and @xmath18 , but as the planet is not a blackbody , the values found are only suggestive . for hd209458b , @xcite determine a brightness temperature @xmath19 k.",
    "to obtain our atmospheric pressure - temperature ( _ p - t _ ) profiles and spectra for the planets we employ a 1d model atmosphere code that has been used for a variety of planetary and substellar objects .",
    "the code was first used to generate profiles and spectra for titan by @xcite .",
    "it was significantly revised to model the atmospheres of brown dwarfs @xcite , uranus @xcite , and egps @xcite .",
    "it explicitly includes both incident radiation from the parent star and thermal radiation from the planet s atmosphere .",
    "the basic radiative transfer solving scheme was developed by @xcite .",
    "we use the elemental abundance data of @xcite and compute chemical equilibrium compositions following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition we maintain a large and constantly updated opacity database .",
    "we predict all cloud properties using the model of @xcite with a sedimentation efficiency parameter @xmath20 , which fits spectral observations of cloudy l - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this model places 90% of the optical depth of a cloud within 1 scale height of the cloud base .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite and marley et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "we model the impinging stellar flux from 0.26 to 10.0 @xmath0 m and the emitted thermal flux from 0.26 to 325 @xmath0 m .",
    "all the relevant planetary parameters for tres-1  are taken from @xcite .",
    "those for hd209458b  are taken from @xcite .",
    "for the tres-1  stellar model we use the kurucz k0v model atmosphere computed for the @xcite paper . for hd209458b",
    "we use a @xcite g0v model ( l@xmath21l@xmath22 ) with parameters described in @xcite .",
    "the planet s radiative - convective _ p - t _ profile is arrived at iteratively until the net flux is conserved to at least one part in @xmath23 .",
    "we compute all band - averaged flux density ratios using eq .",

    "our model atmosphere code computes the _ p - t _ profile and low resolution spectra covering our full wavelength range . to generate a high - resolution spectrum we take",
    "the generated _ p - t _ profile and use a full line - by - line radiative transfer code , using the same chemistry and opacity database used in determining the _ p - t _ profile and low - resolution spectrum @xcite .",
    "our computed atmosphere profiles are shown in .",
    "two cloudless profiles for tres-1  are shown , one under the assumption that absorbed stellar radiation is reradiated from the entire planet , and one for the assumption that the planet can only reradiate this energy on the day side . for these cases",
    "we derive a @xmath4 of 1134 k and 1352 k , respectively .",
    "both of these profiles assume solar metallicity and an intrinsic temperature , @xmath24 of 250 k. this @xmath24 is the @xmath4 the planet would have if it were in isolation . for the @xmath8 case we also plot a profile for @xmath25 k , which leads to a deeper radiative zone , but has no effect on the emitted spectrum .",
    "the presence of an outer radiative zone is predicted for the atmospheres of all pegasi planets and is a caused by the dominance of external ( stellar ) radiation over internal heat flux @xcite .",
    "the planet s",
    "current @xmath26 can only be derived from thermal evolution models of the planet , which we do not compute here . for the @xmath8 tres-1  profile",
    "we show the model s range of brightness temperatures in 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "we also plot our derived _",
    "profile for hd209458b .",
    "this profile assumes @xmath8 reradiation , solar metallicity , and @xmath27 k. for hd209458b  we find @xmath28 k , @xmath3  300 k hotter than that for tres-1 . the model s brightness temperature at 24 @xmath0 m is shown as a plus on this profile .",
    "we also plot the boundary where co and ch@xmath29 have the same abundance .",
    "we predict co will be the dominant ( but not exclusive ) carrier of carbon for both planets . also shown",
    "are the condensation curves for na@xmath30s , enstatite ( mgsio@xmath31 ) , forsterite ( mg@xmath30sio@xmath29 ) and iron ( fe ) .",
    "clouds form deep in the atmosphere of tres-1  and therefore have no effect on the planet s spectrum . for hd209458b",
    ", we find that a potential enstatite cloud layer does affect the _ p - t _ profile and spectrum , as shown by the dash - dot profile .",
    "high clouds in the atmosphere of hd209458b  are compatible with the available data from atmospheric transmission spectroscopy @xcite , although the clouds in those studies are at mbar pressures .",
    "our profile for hd209458b  is very similar to the @xmath8 model of @xcite , although our profiles show hints of stratospheric temperature inversions due to absorption by near infrared water bands , which to our knowledge other authors have not found .",
    "our computed flux ratios for the hd209458b  model atmospheres match the @xcite observation well .",
    "we find @xmath32 for a cloudless model or with clouds of iron and forsterite , which is within the 1@xmath2 error bar .",
    "if the silicate cloud is not forsterite , but enstatite , which forms higher in the atmosphere , we find @xmath33 .",
    "models computed assuming 2@xmath34 reradiation would be brighter at 24 @xmath0 m , leading to a poorer fit to the datum .    for tres-1",
    "we will examine our model atmospheres in detail .",
    "in we show three panels of results .",
    "panel a shows the surface flux of the model k0v stellar spectrum along with two computed surface fluxes of planet tres-1 .",
    "these spectra are for @xmath9 and @xmath8 reradiation and solar metallicity .",
    "as expected , the @xmath9 spectrum is brighter",
    ". note that between 4 - 10 @xmath0 m we find that emitted planetary flux is @xmath3  7 - 9 orders of magnitude brighter than reflected stellar flux .",
    "the lower two panels of show the planet / star flux ratio , as would be seen by a distant observer , which folds in the factor of @xmath3  60 difference in surface area of the planet and star .",
    "these panels compare our computed ratios to those measured by @xcite . for @xmath9 reradiation",
    "our ratio at 4.5 @xmath0 m is 4.5@xmath2 too high , indicating the planet model is far too luminous at these wavelengths .",
    "however , the fit at 8.0 @xmath0 m is quite good . for the @xmath8 model",
    ", the flux at 4.5 @xmath0 m is a reasonable fit , falling just above 1@xmath2 error bars , while at 8.0 @xmath0 m the model falls below the 2@xmath2 error bar .",
    "both of these models have approximately the same infrared spectral slope , which is obviously not as steep as @xcite observed .",
    "this slope is mainly controlled by h@xmath30o absorption on the blue side of the 4.5 @xmath0 m band and strong co absorption on the red side . at 8.0 @xmath0 m , h@xmath30o and",
    "ch@xmath29 are the dominant absorbers . based on these results , we rule out the 2@xmath34 model and",
    "examine the sensitivity of the spectral slope to model parameters .",
    "our computed brightness temperatures for the @xmath8 models are @xmath35 k and @xmath36 k , while @xcite found @xmath16 . compared to a blackbody",
    ", the planet is redder while the models are bluer .",
    "a flux deficit at 4.5 @xmath0 m , relative to atmosphere models using equilibrium chemistry , is a common feature of jupiter and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to dredging of co from deeper layers , which absorbs flux from 4.5 - 5 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "we find this process can not affect the atmosphere of tres-1  as co is already the dominant carbon - bearing molecule in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "we also varied the metallicity of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "we computed chemistry and opacity grids at metallicities of 3.2 ( [ m / h]=0.5 ) and 5.0 ( [ m / h]=0.7 ) times solar . recall that jupiter s atmosphere is enhanced in heavy elements by factors of @xmath3  2 - 4 . with 3.2@xmath37 or 5@xmath37 solar metallicity",
    "the models fall within the 1@xmath2 error bar at 4.5 @xmath0 m and 2@xmath2 at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "panel c of shows the flux ratios for the 5@xmath37 solar abundance model . increasing the metallicity by 3.2@xmath37 decreases the ch@xmath29/co ratio by an order of magnitude .",
    "( the position of ch@xmath29/co=1 curve varies inversely proportional to the metal / hydrogen ratio . ) this in turn increases the 8.0 @xmath0 m band flux by weakening the strong ch@xmath29 band at 7.8 @xmath0 m . increasing the metallicity also increases the amount of h@xmath30o , which decreases the flux on the blue side of the 4.5 @xmath0 m band .",
    "we also considered whether we could further improve the fit by increasing the c / o ratio from 0.5 ( solar ) to 0.7 , therefore increasing co absorption at 4.5 @xmath0 m and decreasing h@xmath30o absorption at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , increasing the c / o ratio ( by increasing the carbon abundance ) _ increases _ the ch@xmath29 abundance relative to co ( and h@xmath30o ) and flux actually decreases in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band . increasing [ m / h ] from 0 to + 0.5 or increasing the c / o ratio from 0.5 to 0.7 has very little effect on the strength of the co band .",
    "this is because the band is formed very high in the atmosphere and is already saturated at solar abundances .",
    "another avenue we pursued was increasing the temperature of the upper atmosphere . in our models the pressures at which optical depth unity occurs in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band are slightly smaller than those in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band , although there is considerable overlap .",
    "( see . ) therefore , increasing the temperatures at lower pressures preferentially increases the @xmath38 relative to @xmath39 .",
    "we deposited additional energy in the form of a chapman function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , into the upper atmosphere at pressures ranging from 1 to 10 mbar .",
    "possible unmodeled energy sources include conduction downward from a hot thermosphere @xcite , the breaking of gravity waves , or an unmodeled optical absorber , such as photochemical products .",
    "profiles that warm the atmosphere at 10 mbar by @xmath3  200 k ( requiring @xmath3  @xmath40 erg @xmath41 sec@xmath42 , or 2.5% of the incoming stellar flux ) generate more flux in the 8.0@xmath0 m band , and reach the 2@xmath2 error bars in both bands .",
    "reprentative flux ratios of one of these models is shown in panel c of .    in another trial ( not shown )",
    "we modeled a strong continuum opacity source from 2 - 6 @xmath0 m .",
    "an appropriately strong absorber cuts down the flux in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band while increasing flux in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band , which allows the model to fit the 1@xmath2 error bars in both bands .",
    "it is unclear what this mystery opacity source could be .",
    "@xcite found that hd209458b  should be free of hydrocarbon hazes as atmospheric temperatures are too high for hydrocarbons to condense .",
    "their conclusion should hold for tres-1 , although it is @xmath3  300 k cooler .",
    "we note that the photochemical destruction of ch@xmath29 @xcite would lead to slightly weaker absorption at 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "we find that a solar metallicity atmosphere for tres-1  marginally fits the _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "models with enhanced metallicity are promising as they fall within the 1@xmath2 error bar in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band and 2@xmath2 error bar in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band .",
    "solar metallicity models with extra energy deposition into the stratosphere fit at the 2@xmath2 level .",
    "as shows , observations with irac at 3.6 @xmath0 m look most promising for further separating the predictions of standard solar abundance models from others . for the model phase space",
    "we explore it is extremely difficult to obtain brightness temperatures of @xmath16 .",
    "one possible remedy would be for the planet to have a cooler troposphere than we predict here , but a much hotter stratosphere , which could cause the planet s absorption features to become emission features , and vice versa",
    ". we can recover this behavior with an ad - hoc _ p - t _ profile .",
    "we note that in jupiter the 7.8 @xmath0 m ch@xmath29 feature is seen in emission , not absorption .",
    "as shown above , standard solar abundance models fit the @xcite mips observation well .",
    "however , with this one data point _ metal enhanced atmospheres are not excluded_. the known differences between hd209458b  and tres-1  are the former s larger radius and higher @xmath4 .",
    "it is not yet clear if these atmospheres are substantially different in character .",
    "possibilities include opacity due to silicate condensates in hd209458b  but not tres-1 , and opacity due to photochemical products in tres-1  but not hd209458b .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations in additional bandpasses for both planets will help to characterize these atmospheres .",
    "observations of the depth of the primary eclipse with _ spitzer _ will allow the measurements of nightside fluxes of the planet , which would place strong constraints on atmospheric dynamics and on the energy redistribution between the day / night hemispheres .",
    "in we collect our computed planet / star flux ratios for a variety of tres-1  and hd209458b  models in all four irac bands and the mips 24 @xmath0 m band .",
    "since models of the mid infrared spectra of brown dwarfs match observations to date @xcite , we suggest that while atmospheric composition plays a role , a complete explanation for the red spectral slope of tres-1  likely will involve energy from the parent star . whether this is due to unknown photochemical processes , unmodeled energy sources that dramatically modify the _ p - t _ profile , or some other process is not yet clear .",
