    "this paper , following @xcite , is the second in a series of three devoted to the analysis of the resolvent family and spectral measure for the laplacian on an asymptotically hyperbolic , nontrapping manifold .",
    "the third paper , by the first author alone , will establish global - in - time strichartz estimates on such a manifold .",
    "let @xmath6 be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold of dimension @xmath7 ( see section  [ subsec : ahm ] for the precise definition of ` asymptotically hyperbolic ' ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be the positive laplacian on @xmath6 , which is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that the spectrum of @xmath0 is absolutely continuous on @xmath9 @xcite with possibly finitely many eigenvalues ( of finite multiplicity ) in @xmath10 .",
    "we write @xmath11 for the operator @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath13 indicates positive part  thus , @xmath11 vanishes on the pure point eigenspaces . in this paper , we analyze the spectral measure @xmath14 of the operator @xmath11 , under the assumption that @xmath6 is nontrapping ( that is , every geodesic reaches infinity both forward and backward ) and that there is no resonance at the bottom of the continuous spectrum , @xmath15 . to do this ,",
    "we express the spectral measure @xmath14 in terms of the boundary values of the resolvent @xmath16 just ` above ' and ` below ' the spectrum in @xmath17 .",
    "we then use the construction of the resolvent given by mazzeo and melrose @xcite ( valid when the spectral parameter lies in a compact set ) , melrose , s barreto and vasy @xcite ( high energy estimates for a perturbation of the hyperbolic metric ) and the present authors @xcite ( and , independently , @xcite ) in the general high - energy case to get precise information about the schwartz kernel of the spectral measure . in particular , following the work of the second author with guillarmou and sikora @xcite in the asymptotically conic setting , this will allow us to obtain precise pointwise bounds on the schwartz kernel , when ( micro)localized near the diagonal in a certain sense .",
    "we then apply these pointwise kernel bounds to prove operator norm estimates on the spectral measure @xmath14 , and on general functions @xmath18 of the operator @xmath11 , again following the general strategy of @xcite .",
    "however , there are key differences in the results we prove here compared to the asymptotically conic case , which can be traced to the exponential , as opposed to polynomial , growth of the volume of large balls in the present setting . in the case of the restriction theorem , that is , an @xmath19 bound on the spectral measure , we prove more : we obtain an estimate for all @xmath20 , while in the asymptotically conic case , it is well known that such an estimate fails for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dimension . in the case of the spectral multiplier result ,",
    "that is , boundedness of @xmath18 , where we assume only a finite amount of sobolev regularity on @xmath5 , boundedness on @xmath23 spaces fails for @xmath24 due to results of clerc - stein @xcite and taylor @xcite .",
    "instead , we obtain boundedness on @xmath25 for @xmath20 , provided @xmath1 is negatively curved .",
    "consider functions of an abstract ( unbounded ) self - adjoint operator @xmath26 on a hilbert space @xmath27 .",
    "these are defined by the spectral theorem for unbounded self - adjoint operators ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "one standard version of this theorem says that there is a one - to - one correspondence between self - adjoint operators @xmath26 and increasing , right - continuous families of projections @xmath28 , @xmath29 , having the property that the strong limit of @xmath28 as @xmath30 is the zero operator and as @xmath31 is the identity .",
    "the correspondence is given by @xmath32 if @xmath33 is a real - valued borel function on @xmath34 , then @xmath35 with domain @xmath36 is self - adjoint .",
    "here the formula means @xmath37 which can be interpreted as a stieltjes integral since @xmath38 is a nondecreasing function of @xmath39 .",
    "we call @xmath40 the spectral measure associated with the operator @xmath26",
    ".    in particular we can apply this when @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we then write @xmath14 for the spectral measure of @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath43 is a positive operator , we only need to integrate over @xmath44 in this case .    returning to the abstract operator @xmath26 , the resolvent family @xmath45 is a holomorphic family of bounded operators on @xmath27 for @xmath46 . in many cases , including in the present setting , the resolvent family extends continuously to the real axis as a bounded operator in a weaker sense , e.g. between weighted @xmath47 spaces , and is then differentiable in @xmath39 up to the real axis .",
    "in that case , we find that @xmath28 is differentiable in @xmath39 and we have stone s formula @xmath48    in this case we write ( abusing notation somewhat ) @xmath40 for the derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "stone s formula gives a mechanism for analyzing the spectral measure , namely we need to analyze the limit of the resolvent @xmath49 on the real axis . in the case of @xmath43",
    ", we notice that the spectral measure @xmath14 for @xmath43 is @xmath50 times the spectral measure at @xmath51 for @xmath0 .",
    "this gives us the formula @xmath52      stein @xcite and tomas @xcite proved estimates for the restriction of the fourier transform of an @xmath53 function to the sphere @xmath54 : @xmath55.\\ ] ] alternatively , we may formulate the estimate in terms of the the restriction operator @xmath56 to the hypersphere , @xmath57 the stein - tomas theorem is equivalent to the boundedness of @xmath58 , which in turn is equivalent to the boundedness of @xmath59 the schwartz kernel of @xmath60 , @xmath61 is @xmath62 times the spectral measure @xmath63 for the square root of the flat laplacian on @xmath64 , since the spectral projection @xmath65 of @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , one may rewrite the restriction theorem as the following estimate : @xmath68 provided @xmath69.$ ] this naturally leads to the question : for which riemannian manifolds @xmath70 does the spectral measure for @xmath71 map @xmath72 to @xmath73 for some @xmath20 , and how does the norm depend in the spectral parameter ?",
    "we refer to such an estimate as a ` restriction estimate ' or a ` restriction theorem ' .",
    "such a result is a continuous spectral analogue of the well - known discrete restriction theorem of sogge ( * ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .      as the present paper is inspired by work by the second author with guillarmou and sikora @xcite on asymptotically conic spaces , we review the results of @xcite here .",
    "asymptotically conic spaces @xmath74 , of dimension @xmath75 , are modelled on spaces that at infinity look like the ` large end of a cone ' ; that is , have one end diffeomorphic to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a closed manifold of dimension @xmath78 , with a metric of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 a metric on @xmath77 .",
    "such spaces are euclidean - like at infinity , in the sense that the volume of balls of radius @xmath81 are uniformly bounded above and below by multiples of @xmath82 , and in the sense that the curvature tends to zero , and the local injectivity radius tends to infinity , at infinity .",
    "if we add the condition that the manifold be nontrapping , then such spaces are also dynamically similar to euclidean space ( although they may have conjugate points ) .",
    "consequently , the spectral analysis of such spaces behaves in many ways like euclidean space .",
    "this is illustrated by the results from @xcite .",
    "on @xmath83 , the spectral measure satisfies pointwise kernel bounds of the form @xmath84 and this estimate is essentially optimal , in the sense that neither exponent can be improved . in @xcite it was shown that , if @xmath74 is an asymptotically conic nontrapping manifold , and @xmath0 its laplacian , then there is a partition of unity @xmath85 , depending on @xmath39 , and @xmath86 such that @xmath87 for @xmath88 $ ] , where @xmath89 is the riemannian distance in @xcite , but in @xcite it was observed that the same construction gives the more general estimates in . ] .",
    "the @xmath90 are semiclassical pseudodifferential operators ( with semiclassical parameter @xmath91 with small microsupport .",
    "therefore , the operators @xmath92 can be considered to be the kernel of the spectral measure ( micro)localized near the diagonal . moreover , in the case where there are no conjugate points , then the estimate above is valid without the partition of unity .    this estimate was shown to imply a global restriction estimate , that is , an @xmath93 operator norm bound on @xmath94 . in fact , this was proved at an abstract level :    [ kernel2restriction ] let @xmath95 be a metric measure space , and @xmath26 an abstract positive self - adjoint operator on @xmath96 .",
    "suppose that the spectral measure @xmath97 has a schwartz kernel satisfying ( with @xmath98 replaced by @xmath89 ) for @xmath99 , as well as for @xmath100 and @xmath101 if @xmath75 is even , or @xmath102 and @xmath103 if @xmath75 is odd .",
    "then the operator norm estimate @xmath104 holds for all @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , if the kernel estimates above hold for some range of @xmath39 , then holds for @xmath39 in the same range .    finally , it was shown in @xcite that , at an abstract level , such a restriction estimate implies spectral multiplier estimates :    [ restriction2multiplier ] let @xmath95 be a metric measure space , such that the volume of each ball of radius @xmath81 is comparable to @xmath82 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a positive self - adjoint operator such that @xmath106 satisfies finite propagation speed on @xmath107 , and the restriction theorem @xmath108 holds uniformly with respect to @xmath105 for @xmath109 .",
    "then there is a uniform operator norm bound on spectral multipliers on @xmath23 of the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an even function supported in @xmath112 $ ] , and @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , one concludes and when @xmath1 is an asymptotically conic nontrapping manifold of dimension @xmath22 .",
    "we next consider existing results on hyperbolic space .",
    "we return to our convention where the dimension is @xmath7 . using explicit formulae for the schwartz kernel of functions of the operator @xmath114",
    ", we deduce pointwise bounds @xmath115 for @xmath116 , and derivative estimates also , but we do not need such estimates in the low energy case . ]",
    "@xmath117 when @xmath118 .",
    "closely related pointwise bounds for the wave kernels @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the heat kernel @xmath121 and the schrdinger propagator @xmath122 on hyperbolic space have been exploited in various works ; see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    to the authors knowledge ,",
    "the recent paper @xcite by huang and sogge is the only previous paper in which restriction estimates for hyperbolic space have been considered .",
    "huang and sogge proved restriction estimates for @xmath123 in the same range @xmath124 $ ] as for euclidean space , using the exact expression for the hyperbolic resolvent , and complex interpolation , in the manner of stein s original proof of the stein - tomas restriction theorem @xcite ( this argument was presented in an abstract formulation in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , on hyperbolic space ( and , as we shall show , asymptotically hyperbolic nontrapping spaces ) , restriction estimates are valid for all @xmath125  see section  [ sec : model ] for a very simple proof on @xmath126 .",
    "spectral multiplier estimates on hyperbolic and asymptotically hyperbolic spaces on @xmath53 spaces ( much more general than those considered here ) have been well studied .",
    "it was pointed out by clerc and stein @xcite for symmetric spaces and taylor @xcite for spaces with exponential volume growth and @xmath127 bounded geometry that a _ necessary _",
    "condition for @xmath128 to be bounded is that @xmath5 admit an analytic continuation to a strip in the complex plane .",
    "cheeger , gromov and taylor @xcite , and taylor @xcite showed that if @xmath74 has @xmath127 bounded geometry and injectivity radius bounded from below , then @xmath129 maps @xmath130 into itself for @xmath131 , provided that @xmath5 is holomorphic and even on the strip @xmath132 for some @xmath133 and satisfies symbol estimates @xmath134 on the strip .    by constrast",
    ", we want to consider the mapping properties of @xmath128 where @xmath5 has only finite sobolev regularity .",
    "this is motivated by typical applications of spectral multipliers in harmonic analysis , such as riesz means , and in pde , in which one often wants to restrict to a dyadic frequency interval , that is , to the range of a spectral projector of the form @xmath135}(p)$ ] , or a smoothed version of this .",
    "clearly , such a spectral multiplier can not have an analytic continuation to a strip . on the other hand ,",
    "the work of clerc - stein and taylor shows that boundedness on @xmath53 , @xmath24 , can not be expected .",
    "this motivates us to search for replacements for @xmath53 spaces , on which spectral multipliers are bounded .",
    "the geometric setting in the present paper is that of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold @xmath6 is the interior of a compact manifold @xmath1 with boundary , such that the riemannian metric @xmath136 takes a specific degenerate form near the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , near each boundary point , there are local coordinates @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is a boundary defining function and @xmath139 restrict to local coordinates on @xmath140 , such that @xmath136 takes the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a family of metrics on @xmath140 , smoothly parametrized by @xmath138 . under the metric @xmath136 ,",
    "the interior @xmath143 of @xmath1 is a complete riemannian manifold .",
    "as is well known , @xmath7-dimensional hyperbolic space takes this form in the poincar ball model .",
    "indeed , @xmath144 is given by the interior of the unit ball in @xmath145 , with the metric @xmath146 where @xmath147 are the standard coordinates on @xmath145 .",
    "other examples include all convex co - compact hyperbolic manifolds , and compactly supported metric perturbations of these .",
    "such spaces are termed asymptotically hyperbolic spaces as the sectional curvatures tend to @xmath148 at infinity @xcite .",
    "analytically , they have many similarities to hyperbolic spaces .",
    "consider the resolvent @xmath149 on @xmath144 , which is well - defined as a bounded operator on @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "notice that the axis @xmath152 corresponds to the spectrum of @xmath0 , and the point @xmath153 corresponds to the point @xmath154 in the spectrum of @xmath155 . on @xmath144 ,",
    "the resolvent @xmath156 extends to a holomorphic function of @xmath157 when @xmath158 is even , and a meromorphic function with poles at @xmath159 when @xmath158 is odd .    for asymptotically hyperbolic spaces , it is known from work of mazzeo - melrose @xcite and guillarmou @xcite that the resolvent @xmath160 extends to be a meromorphic function of @xmath161 on @xmath162 , and extends to be meromorphic on the whole of @xmath17 provided that @xmath136 is even in @xmath138 , that is , a smooth function of @xmath163 .",
    "in addition , it is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the spectral axis @xmath152 except possibly at the point @xmath164 itself , corresponding to the bottom of the continuous spectrum , which could be a simple pole @xcite . in the present article",
