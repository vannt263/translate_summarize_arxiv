    "the study of the variations of one chemical element relative to another is crucial for our understanding of the chemical evolution of galaxies and for constraining models of stellar nucleosynthesis and the shape of the initial mass function .",
    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) are ideal objects in which to carry out such a study .",
    "they are low - luminosity ( @xmath11 @xmath8 18 mag ) dwarf systems undergoing intense bursts of star formation which give birth to a large number ( 10@xmath12  10@xmath13 ) of massive stars in a compact region , which ionize the interstellar medium , producing high - excitation supergiant h ii regions , and enrich it with heavy elements ( see thuan 1991 for a review ) .",
    "the optical spectra of these h ii regions show strong narrow emission lines superposed on a stellar continuum which is rising toward the blue , allowing abundance determination of such heavy elements as nitrogen , oxygen , neon , sulfur , argon and iron .",
    "recently , the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has permitted the determination of carbon and silicon abundances from emission lines in the uv range ( garnett et al .",
    "1995ab ; thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1996 ; garnett et al . 1997",
    "; kobulnicky et al .",
    "1997 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1998 ; thuan , izotov & foltz 1998 ) .",
    "these studies are particularly important for understanding the evolutionary status of extremely low - metallicity bcgs .",
    "the debate has been raging for decades , ever since the discovery paper by sargent & searle ( 1970 ) , on whether bcgs are truly nearby young dwarf galaxies undergoing one of their first bursts of star formation , or the present starburst is occurring within an older galaxy .",
    "the abundances of heavy elements in these galaxies ranging between @xmath2/50 and @xmath2/3 make them among the least chemically evolved galaxies in the universe .",
    "however , subsequent photometric studies have shown that the majority of blue compact galaxies possess an old stellar population .",
    "hence they have experienced star formation episodes in the past and are not young .",
    "loose & thuan ( 1985 ) found that @xmath9 95% of the bcgs in their sample exhibit an underlying extended red low surface brightness component , on which are superposed the high surface brightness blue star - forming regions .",
    "later ccd surveys of bcgs have confirmed and strengthened that initial result ( kunth , maurogordato & vigroux 1988 ; papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ; telles & terlevich 1997 ) . however , there are at least two known objects with extremely young stellar populations .",
    "they are the two most - metal deficient galaxies known , i zw 18 ( @xmath2/50 , searle & sargent 1972 ) and sbs 0335052",
    ". _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging of i zw 18 to @xmath14 @xmath9 26 mag by hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) suggests that the stellar population is dominated by young stars and that the colors of the underlying diffuse component are consistent with those from a sea of unresolved b or early a stars , with no evidence for stars older than @xmath9 10@xmath15 yr . the bcg sbs 0335052 was first shown by izotov et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to possess an extraordinarily low metallicity , equal to 1/41 of the sun s metallicity ( melnick , heydari - malayeri & leisy 1992 ) .",

    "the blue low intensity emission has been shown by izotov et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and papaderos et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to be the combined effect of emission from ionized gas ( contributing @xmath9 1/3 of the total flux ) and from a very young stellar population ( contributing the remaining @xmath9 2/3 of the emission ) , not older than @xmath9 10@xmath18 yr . there is further observational evidence for the extremely young age of sbs 0335052 .",
    "thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) have argued from",
    "uv spectrophotometry that the large ( some 64 kpc in size ) and massive ( @xmath9 10@xmath19 @xmath5 ) h i cloud associated with the bcg ( pustilnik et al .",
    "1998 ) is made of pristine gas , unpolluted by metals .",
    "the above observational evidence thus strongly suggests that there exists in our local volume of space a few young dwarf galaxies in which the first star formation did not occur until @xmath9 100 myr ago",
    ". somehow the h i clouds with which they are associated have not undergone gravitational collapse for a whole hubble time .",
    "the detailed studies of these young dwarf galaxies are not only important for understanding their intrinsic properties , but are also crucial for galaxy formation studies .",
    "the proximity of these young dwarfs allows studies of their structure , metal content and stellar populations , and star formation processes in a nearly pristine environment with a sensitivity , precision and spatial resolution that faint small angular size distant high - redshift galaxies do not allow .",
    "we focus here on the analysis of heavy element abundance ratios in bcgs .",
    "we shall show that some of these ratios are very good indicators of the bcg age .",
    "it is now well established that the oxygen seen in h ii regions is a primary element produced by massive stars with @xmath3 @xmath4 10 @xmath5 ( see the review by weaver & woosley 1993 ) . as for the other @xmath10-process elements seen in the spectra of h ii regions , such as neon , silicon ,",
    "sulfur and argon , they are generally thought to be also primary ( see thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1995 , hereafter til95 ) for references ) .",
    "carbon is also a primary element , believed to be produced by both massive and intermediate - mass ( 3 @xmath5 @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath0 9 @xmath5 ) stars .",
    "however , because carbon has its strong nebular emission lines not in the optical but the uv range , it has not been possible until recently , with the advent of _ hst _ , to obtain precise measurements of its abundance .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1995a ) found the c / o ratio in bcgs to increase with increasing oxygen abundance and its value in the lowest metallicity galaxies to be below the one predicted by stellar nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "however , a subsequent study by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found the c / o ratio in i zw 18 to be much larger ( by a factor of @xmath9 2 ) than the mean value for other metal - deficient galaxies .",
    "this led those authors to conclude that i zw 18 is not a young galaxy , but that it has experienced carbon - enriching episodes of star formation in the past .",
    "the situation for nitrogen is even more complex .",
    "spectral observations of h ii regions in spiral galaxies with high metallicities ( @xmath1 @xmath9 @xmath2 ) show that the n / o ratio increases with o / h ( pagel & edmunds 1981 ; serrano & peimbert 1983 ; torres - peimbert , peimbert & fierro 1989 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ) .",
    "this implies that a large part of the nitrogen in these high - metallicity spiral galaxies is produced as a secondary element in the cno cycle , i.e. its synthesis is controlled by carbon seed atoms already present in the main - sequence or red - giant stars ( which can be of any mass ) .",
    "however , in low metallicity ( @xmath2/50 @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath2/3 ) environments such as in irregular and blue compact galaxies ,",
    "the n / o ratio is found to be constant and independent of o / h ( lequeux et al . 1979 ; french 1980 ; kinman & davidson 1981 ; kunth & sargent 1983 ; campbell , terlevich & melnick 1986 ; til95 ) .",
    "this implies that nitrogen is mainly a primary element when o / h is small .",
    "stellar nucleosynthesis models predict that primary nitrogen is produced mainly in intermediate - mass stars by hot - bottom carbon burning undergoing a third dredge - up episode which brings carbon - rich material from the core into the hydrogen - burning shell ( renzini & voli 1981 , hereafter rv81 ; van den hoek & groenewegen 1997 , hereafter hg97 ) .",
    "the spread of the n / o ratio at a fixed o / h in early spectral observations is seen to be large and has been attributed to observational uncertainties and/or to the time delays ( @xmath20 @xmath0 5@xmath2110@xmath18 yr ) between the production of oxygen by short - lived massive stars and that of nitrogen by longer - lived intermediate - mass stars ( matteucci & tosi 1985 ; garnett 1990 ; pilyugin 1992 , 1993 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ; marconi , matteucci & tosi 1994 ) .",
    "however , til95 have shown subsequently that a large part of the scatter is due to observational uncertainties .",
    "high signal - to - noise observations show a very small dispersion of log n / o ( @xmath6 0.02 dex ) at low metallicities , which favors primary nitrogen production not in intermediate - mass stars but in massive ones .",
    "the optical spectra of bcgs also contain iron lines , which allow to derive abundances for that element , as was first done by til95 .",
    "iron is a primary element produced by explosive nucleosynthesis either in type i supernovae ( sne i ) with low - mass progenitors , or in type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) with more massive progenitors ( weaver & woosley 1993 ; woosley & weaver 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) . during the collapse of the galaxy , while o and other @xmath10-elements are mainly produced in massive stars and restored to the interstellar medium ( ism ) through sne ii , iron is thought to come mainly from sne i. therefore , due to the different evolution timescales of stars with different masses , oxygen is injected sooner than iron into the ism , resulting in an oxygen overabundance relative to iron in the halo population .",
    "it is well established that halo population ii stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 1 ( where [ x ] @xmath22 log x  log x@xmath23 ) have a constant overabundance [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0.3  0.5 . as for disk stars with higher metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1 )",
    ", they show a progressive decrease of o / fe toward the solar ratio ( [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0 ) ( lambert , sneden & ries 1974 ; spite & spite 1981 ; gratton & ortolani 1986 ; barbuy 1988 ; barbuy & erdelyi - mendes 1989 ; edvardsson et al .",

    "this paper is a continuation of the study by til95 , based on a substantially larger observational sample ( more than triple the size of the old sample ) .",
    "we found the enlarged sample to confirm and considerably strengthen the main results obtained by til95 . in ",
    "2 we discuss the properties of the sample . the methods used for heavy element abundance determinations are discussed in  3 . in  4 we discuss how the behavior of various heavy element abundance ratios as a function of metallicity can constrain the origin of these elements .",
    "we discuss in  5 how these data can put limits on the age of bcgs .",
    "we show that bcgs with metallicities below a certain value are likely to be young systems which are making stars for the first time at the present epoch . in ",
    "6 we compare our results for heavy element abundances in bcgs with those in another highly metal - deficient environment : that of high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 galaxies .",
    "we summarize our results in  7 .",
    "we choose for analysis the sample of low - metallicity bcgs for which we have obtained optical spectrophotometry to derive the primordial helium abundance . because the requirements for an accurate helium abundance determination are very strict ( the precision has to be better than a few percent ) ,",
    "the spectra have been obtained at the 4 m and 2.1 m kitt peak telescopes with the very highest signal - to - noise ratio , typically @xmath9 20 to 40 in the continuum .",
    "the sample includes mainly bcgs from the first byurakan ( or markarian ) and second byurakan surveys .",

    "the results of the spectrophotometric observations and the details of the data reduction are presented in izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1994 , 1997 , hereafter itl94 and itl97 ) , til95 and izotov & thuan ( 1998ab ) . the total sample consists of 54 supergiant h ii regions observed in 50 bcgs .",
    "all observed h ii regions are of high excitation , with equivalent widths of h@xmath25 generally larger than 100  .",
    "for the majority of the bcgs in the sample , high - order h9 to h12 balmer emission lines are detected , which permits to correct the observed line intensities for both extinction and underlying hydrogen stellar absorption with a very high precision over the whole optical spectral range .",
    "this is most important as uncertainties in these corrections will introduce uncertainties in the derived abundances , resulting in an artificial scatter in the data . in particular",
    ", it is especially important that these corrections are done correctly for the [ o ii ] @xmath243727 line at the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "this line is used for the determination of the o@xmath26 abundance and for the correction of nitrogen and iron abundances for unseen stages of ionization .",
    "ignoring , for example , stellar hydrogen absorption will lead to an overestimate of the extinction and of the intensity of [ o ii ] @xmath243727 , and to an underestimate of nitrogen and iron abundances . in all cases therefore , we have made sure that the balmer hydrogen emission line intensity ratios are in agreement with the theoretical recombination ratios after correction for both these effects .",
    "another important feature of the sample is that the auroral [ o iii ] @xmath244363 line is detected with a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this allows to derive electron temperatures and element abundances with a much higher precision than with the use of empirical statistical methods based , for instance , on the total intensity of oxygen lines .",
    "the precision of these empirical methods is not better than 0.2  0.3 dex in the determination of the oxygen abundance .",
    "our sample includes nearly all of the most metal - deficient bcgs known . among the catalogued bcgs with heavy element abundances less than 1/20 solar , only 3 galaxies ( cg 1116 + 51",
    ", tol 65 and tol 1214277 ) are missing .",
    "the other 6 are present , including the two most metal - deficient galaxies known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 .",
    "we have purposely not included galaxies observed by other authors in the optical range so as to preserve the homogeneity of a data set obtained and reduced by us in a uniform way .",
    "this allows us to minimize the scatter which would be inevitably and artificially introduced , were we to assemble data by different authors with varying quality , which differ by their reduction methods , their line intensity measurements and corrections for extinction and underlying stellar absorption , the formulae used for abundances calculations , etc .",

    "to derive element abundances from the optical spectra , we have followed the procedure detailed in itl94 and itl97 .",
    "we adopt a two - zone photoionized h ii region model ( stasiska 1990 ) : a high - ionization zone with temperature @xmath27(o iii ) , and a low - ionization zone with temperature @xmath27(o ii ) .",
    "we have determined @xmath27(o iii ) from the [ o iii]@xmath244363/(@xmath244959+@xmath245007 ) ratio using a five - level atom model ( aller 1984 ) with atomic data from mendoza ( 1983 ) . that temperature is used for the derivation of the he@xmath26 , he@xmath28 , o@xmath28 , ne@xmath28 and ar@xmath29 ionic abundances . to derive @xmath27(o ii ) , we have used the relation between @xmath27(o ii ) and @xmath27(o iii ) ( itl94 ) , based on a fit to the photoionization models of stasiska ( 1990 ) .",

    "is derived from the [ s ii ] @xmath246717/@xmath246731 ratio .",

    "this gives slightly higher electron temperatures and slightly lower oxygen abundances ( by @xmath9 0.04 dex ) .",
    "the heavy element abundance ratios are however nearly unchanged .",
    "table 1 lists the oxygen abundance and the heavy element to oxygen abundance ratios for all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "carbon is one of the elements which provides strong constraints on the chemical evolution of bcgs and the origin of elements .",

    "_ , much work has been done to determine the carbon abundance in bcgs , using fos spectroscopy ( garnett et al . 1995a , 1997 ; kobulnicky et al .",

    "the same spectra can also be used to derive the silicon abundance when the si iii ] @xmath24(1885 + 1892 ) line is seen .",
    "we have decided to reanalyze some of these data , specifically the galaxies with both uv and optical fos spectra , for the following reasons : ( 1 ) garnett et al .",
    "( 1995a ) used the uv o iii ] @xmath241666 to derive the c / o abundance ratio . while this method has the advantage of being insensitive to the extinction curve adopted , the o iii ] @xmath241666 and c iii ] @xmath241906 + 1909 emission lines being close to each other in wavelength , the weakness of the o iii ] @xmath241666 line makes in many cases the c / o abundance ratio determination very uncertain .",
    "therefore , we have used the [ o iii ] @xmath24(4959 + 5007 ) emission lines in the fos spectra ( these are used instead of higher s / n ground - based spectra to insure that exactly the same region is observed as in the uv ) to determine the c / o abundance ratio .",
    "this approach is subject to uncertainties in the extinction curve but , fortunately , at least in some of the galaxies , the extinction is small .",
    "( 2 ) because of the uncertainties in the atomic data , different authors have used different analytical expressions for the determination of carbon and silicon abundances . as",
    "this may introduce systematic shifts , we have reanalyzed all spectra in the same manner , using the same expressions , to insure the homogeneity of our data set .",
    "( 3 ) the c / o abundance ratio is dependent on several physical parameters , and in particular on the electron temperature which needs to be determined with a relatively high precision . because of the poorer signal - to - noise ratio of the fos spectra in the optical range , garnett et al . ( 1997 ) and kobulnicky & skillman ( 1998 ) have used electron temperatures derived from higher signal - to - noise ratio ground - based observations .",
    "we use here our own new ground - based observations with very high signal - to - noise ratio to better constrain the electron temperature for some of the most metal - deficient galaxies in our sample .",

    "these differences are probably due to a slight positioning shift between the mmt and _ hst _ apertures on the nw component . the electron temperatures and oxygen abundances derived from the mmt spectra for both nw and se components are shown in table 3 . in deriving these quantities , we have neglected temperature fluctuations .",
    "while there is evidence for large temperature fluctuations in planetary nebulae and perhaps in high - metallicity hii regions , we believed that there is , until now , no such convincing evidence for low - metallicity hii regions like the ones considered here ( see a detailed discussion of this issue in izotov & thuan 1998b ) .",
    "the electron temperatures @xmath27(o iii ) are much higher than those obtained by skillman & kennicutt ( 1993 ) through a larger aperture ( 2@xmath215  for the se component and 2@xmath21755 for the nw component ) , by 1900 k in the nw component , and by 2300 k in the se component .",
    "they are also higher by 1800 k and 700 k respectively than the temperatures obtained by izotov & thuan ( 1998a ) within an aperture of 2@xmath215 .",
    "there is evidently a temperature gradient at the center of both nw and se components ( see also martin 1996 ) , and large apertures give invariably lower electron temperatures . matching the small _ hst _ fos aperture as closely as possible is essential to derive appropriate abundances .",
    "the higher electron temperatures lead to lower oxygen abundances than those derived by skillman & kennicutt ( 1993 ) and izotov & thuan ( 1998a ) for larger regions .",
    "note that the oxygen abundance derived for the nw component is lower than that derived for the se component by a factor of @xmath9 1.2 .",
    "this is again because there is a gradient toward higher temperatures in the central part of the nw component , which leads to lower abundances . in larger apertures ,",

    "therefore , the relationships between different heavy element abundances will not only put constraints on the star - formation history of bcgs , they will also be useful for understanding the early chemical evolution of galaxies . furthermore , a precise determination of heavy element abundances in bcgs can put constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis models , as theoretical predictions for the yields of some elements are not yet very firm .",
    "the best studied and most easily observed element in bcgs is oxygen .",
    "nucleosynthesis theory predicts it to be produced only by massive stars .",

    "therefore , the ne / o , si / o , s / o and ar / o ratios should be constant and show no dependence on the oxygen abundance . in figure 1",
    "we show the abundance ratios for these elements as a function of 12 + log o / h ( filled circles ) . for si / o",
    ", we have also shown for comparison the data from garnett et al .",
    "( 1995b ) for those galaxies which we have not reanalyzed for lack of the necessary data ( open circles ) .",
    "these galaxies are not included in the computation of the mean abundance ratios listed in table 5 .",
    "the mean values of these element abundance ratios are directly related to the stellar yields and thus provide strong constraints on the theory of massive stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "note , that while silicon and sulfur abundances can be measured in a wide variety of astrophysical settings ( stars , h ii regions , high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 clouds ) , neon and argon abundances can be measured with good precision at low metallicities only in bcgs .",
    "table 5 gives the mean values of the ne / o , si / o , s / o and ar / o abundance ratios calculated for the total sample , as well as for two subsamples : a low - metallicity subsample containing galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , and a high - metallicity subsample containing galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 .",
    "for comparison , we list also the solar ratios taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) . generally , the dispersion about the mean of the points in the low - metallicity subsample is smaller than that in the high - metallicity subsample and the total sample , although the differences are not statistically significant .",
    "examination of figure 1 and table 5 shows that , as predicted by stellar nucleosynthesis theory , no dependence on oxygen abundance is found for any of the ne / o , si / o , s / o and ar / o abundance ratios .    independently of the subsample , the ne / o , si / o , s / o and ar / o ratios are all very close to the corresponding solar value ( dotted lines in figure 1 )",
    ". there may be a hint that the mean si / o abundance ratio in bcgs is slightly lower than the solar value , but the difference is again not statistically significant . we thus conclude that there is no significant depletion of silicon into dust grains in bcgs . by contrast , garnett et al .",
    "( 1995b ) have found a weighted mean log si / o = 1.59@xmath60.07 for their sample of low - metallicity galaxies , lower by a factor of @xmath9 1.6 than the solar value .",
    "this led them to conclude that about 50% of the silicon is incorporated into dust grains .",
    "the number of galaxies with measured silicon abundances is not large , and more observations are needed for a more definite conclusion .",
    "the mean values of the abundance ratios for the other elements are in very good agreement with those derived by til95 for a smaller sample of bcgs .",
    "til95 have made detailed comparisons of their results with those of previous studies , so we shall not repeat the discussion here .",
    "we shall only mention the more recent work of van zee , haynes & salzer ( 1997 ) who have studied heavy element abundance ratios in the h ii regions of 28 gas - rich , quiescent dwarf galaxies .",
    "their mean ne / o , s / o and ar / o ratios are consistent within the errors with the results of til95 and those obtained here , although in many of their galaxies , the abundance measurements are more uncertain because the [ o iii ] @xmath244363 emission line is not detected and the electron temperature is derived from an empirical method .",
    "carbon is produced by both intermediate and high - mass stars . since c is a product of hydrostatic burning ,",
    "the contributions of sne ia and sne ii are small .",
    "therefore , the c / o abundance ratio is sensitive to the particular star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "it is expected that , in the earliest stages of galaxy evolution , carbon is mainly produced by massive stars , so that the c / o abundance ratio is independent of the oxygen abundance , as both c and o are primary elements . at later stages ,",
    "intermediate - mass stars add their carbon production , so that an increase in the c / o ratio is expected with increasing oxygen abundance .",
    "the results of the study by garnett et al .",
    "( 1995a ) did not conform to these expectations .",
    "those authors found a continuous increase of log c / o with increasing log o / h in their sample of metal - deficient galaxies , which could be fitted by a power law with slope 0.43 . because log c / o is fairly constant at 0.9 for halo stars in the galaxy ( tomkin et al .",
    "1992 ) , garnett et al .",
    "( 1995a ) suggested there may be a difference between the abundance patterns seen in the galaxy and dwarf galaxies .",
    "subsequent _ hst _ fos observations of i zw 18 by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) yielded abundances that complicated the situation even more .",
    "it was found that i zw 18 bucks the trend shown by the other low - metallicity objects .",
    "although it has the lowest metallicity known , it shows a rather high log c / o , equal to 0.63@xmath60.10 and 0.56@xmath60.09 in the nw and se components respectively .",
    "these values are significantly higher than those predicted by massive stellar nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "this led garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to conclude that carbon in i zw 18 has been enhanced by an earlier population of lower - mass stars and , hence , despite its very low metallicity , i zw 18 is not a  primeval \" galaxy .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1997 ) considered and dismissed the possibility that the high c / o ratio in i zw 18 may be due to errors in the electron temperature .",
    "we have revisited the problem here for i zw 18 with our own data and conclude that it is indeed a too low adopted electron temperature which is responsible for the too high c / o ratio in both components of i zw 18 .",
    "the temperatures adopted by garnett et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for i zw 18 are derived from optical observations in an aperture larger than the fos aperture , and are too low because of a temperature gradient . in figure 2a",

    "great care was taken to derive electron temperatures in apertures matching as closely as possible the fos aperture .",
    "open circles show galaxies from garnett et al . which could not be reanalyzed because of lack of the necessary data .",
    "it is clear that , in contrast to the results by garnett et al .",
    "( 1995a , 1997 ) , we find log c / o to be constant in the extremely low - metallicity range , when 12 + log o / h varies between 7.1 and 7.6 , as expected from the common origin of carbon and oxygen in massive stars .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion of the points about the mean is very small : @xmath7log c / o@xmath8 = 0.78@xmath60.03 ( table 5 ) .",
    "this mean value is in very good agreement with that of @xmath9 0.8 predicted by massive stellar nucleosynthesis theory ( weaver & woosley 1993 ; ww95 ) .",
    "two models with @xmath1 = 0 and @xmath1 = 0.01 @xmath2 are shown by horizontal lines in figure 2a .",
    "they are in good agreement with the observations . at higher metallicities ( 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 )",
    ", there is an increase in log c / o with log o / h and also more scatter at a given o / h , which we attribute to the carbon contribution of intermediate - mass stars in addition to that of massive stars .",
    "the origin of nitrogen has been a subject of debate for some years .",
    "the basic nucleosynthesis process is well understood ",
    "nitrogen results from cno processing of oxygen and carbon during hydrogen burning ",
    "however the nature of the stars mainly responsible for the production of nitrogen remains uncertain .",
    "if oxygen and carbon are produced not in previous generation stars , but in the same stars prior to the cno cycle , then the amount of nitrogen produced is independent of the initial heavy element abundance of the star , and its synthesis is said to be primary . on the other hand ,",
    "if the `` seed '' oxygen and carbon are produced in previous generation stars and incorporated into a star at its formation and a constant mass fraction is processed , then the amount of nitrogen produced is proportional to the initial heavy element abundance , and the nitrogen synthesis is said to be secondary .",
    "secondary nitrogen synthesis can occur in stars of all masses , while primary nitrogen synthesis is usually ( but not universally ) thought to occur mainly in intermediate - mass stars ( rv81 , ww95 ) . in the case of secondary nitrogen production",
    ", it is expected that massive stars with decreasing metallicity would produce decreasing amounts of @xmath43n ( ww95 ) .",
    "there is , however , a caveat : there is the possibility that in some massive stars the convective helium shell penetrates into the hydrogen layer , with the consequent production of large amounts of primary nitrogen .    the behavior of the n / o abundance ratio as a function of the o / h ratio has provided the main observational constraint to this debate . in low - metallicity galactic halo stars ,",
    "n / o is nearly independent of o / h implying that nitrogen has a strong primary component which can be explained by primary nitrogen production in massive stars with a large amount of convective overshoot ( timmes , woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "several studies of low - metallicity ( 12 + log o / h @xmath0 8.3 ) h ii regions in dwarf galaxies have also revealed that n / o is independent on o / h implying again a primary origin of nitrogen ( garnett 1990 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ; til95 ; van zee , haynes & salzer 1997 ; van zee , salzer & haynes 1998 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that primary nitrogen in bcgs is produced by intermediate - mass stars by carbon dredge - up ( rv81 ) . for high - metallicity h ii regions in spiral galaxies ( 12 + log o / h @xmath8 8.3 ) ,",
    "the n / o ratio increases linearly with the o abundance , indicating that , in this metallicity regime , n is primarily a secondary element .",
    "we shall not be concerned with secondary n here and shall discuss mainly primary",
    "n since all our bcgs have 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.3 .",
    "a problem in interpreting the data in the vast majority of studies is the existence of a considerable scatter ( @xmath6 0.3 dex ) in n / o at a given o / h .",
    "the large scatter has been attributed to the delayed release of n produced in intermediate - mass long - lived stars , compared to o produced in massive short - lived stars ( matteucci & tosi 1985 ; matteucci 1986 ; garnett 1990 ; pilyugin 1992 , 1993 ; marconi et al . 1994 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast to these studies , til95 found the scatter in n / o at a given o / h to be large only when the metallicity exceeds a certain value , i.e. 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 . at lower o abundances , the scatter is extremely small .",
    "it is difficult to improve much the statistics by adding to the til95 sample more galaxies in this very low - metallicity range because the known objects having such a low heavy element content are very scarce and extremely difficult to discover .",
    "we have added only sbs 0335052 with @xmath2/41 , the second most metal - deficient bcg known after i zw 18 ( figure 2b ) . as for the latter ,",
    "we have used our own data instead of that of skillman & kennicutt ( 1993 ) .",
    "the result is the same .",
    "the scatter of the points is very small : @xmath7log",
    "n / o@xmath8 = 1.60@xmath60.02 ( table 5 ) .",
    "we do not believe that this very small scatter is the result of some unknown selection effect which would invariably pick out low - metallicity bcgs at the same stage of their evolutionary history .",
    "this is because of two reasons .",
    "first , we have plotted all the data we have , without any selection .",
    "second , as discussed later , the scatter does increase substantially for higher - metallicity bcgs .",
    "there is no obvious reason why a selection effect would operate only on low - metallicity objects , but not on higher - metallicity ones .    as discussed by til95 , the very small dispersion of the n / o ratio puts very severe constraints on time - delay models . a time delay between the primary production of oxygen by massive stars and that of nitrogen by intermediate - mass stars can be as large as 5@xmath2110@xmath18 yr , the lifetime of a 2  3 @xmath5 star",
    "this would introduce a significant ( @xmath4 @xmath6 0.2 ) scatter in n / o , as chemical evolution models by pilyugin ( 1993 ) and marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show .",
    "we reiterate the conclusion of til95 , that the small scatter of n / o in the most metal - deficient galaxies in our sample can be best understood if primary n in these galaxies is produced by massive stars ( @xmath3 @xmath8 9 @xmath5 ) only .",
    "as we shall see in section 5 , intermediate - mass stars have not yet returned their nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium in these most metal - poor galaxies , because they have not had enough time to evolve .",
    "there is a further data point which we did not include in our sample , but which strengthens our results even more .",
    "it comes from the western companion of sbs 0335052 , the bcg sbs 0335052 w , located in a common h i envelope with the former .",
    "this bcg was observed by lipovetsky et al .",

    "we have compared our results with those of other authors for bcgs in the range 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , using the compilation of kobulnicky & skillman ( 1996 ) of the existing data for element abundances in bcgs .",
    "two galaxies in their compilation show n / o ratios which are significantly lower than our mean value , by many times the dispersion of our sample .",

    "however , izotov & foltz ( 1998 ) have recently reobserved this galaxy with the mmt and found log n / o = 1.57@xmath60.09 , consistent with the mean value and small dispersion about the mean found here and in til95 . studies of southern bcgs by campbell , terlevich & melnick ( 1986 ) and masegosa et al .",

    "the scatter of the c / o and n / o ratios increases significantly at a given o abundance .",
    "this increase in the dispersion is best explained if , in addition to the production of carbon and primary nitrogen by massive stars during the starburst phase , there is an additional production of both these elements by intermediate - mass stars during the interburst quiescent phase . within the framework of current nucleosynthesis theory ( rv81 , ww95 ) ,",
    "primary nitrogen is produced only by intermediate - mass stars , not by massive stars . in this case",
    "the productions of oxygen and nitrogen would be decoupled and in principle very low n / o values can be observed . however , our observations do not confirm these expectations . instead , figure 2b shows a definite lower envelope for the n / o ratio , at the level set by primary nitrogen production in low - metallicity massive stars .    to summarize ,",
    "we have arrived at the following important conclusions concerning the origin of nitrogen : ( 1 ) in very low - metallicity bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , nitrogen is produced as a primary element by massive stars only .",
    "intermediate - mass stars have not had the time to evolve and release their nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium .",
    "the massive stars set the level of log n / o to be at @xmath9 1.60 .",
    "this picture is the most reasonable one to account for the extremely small dispersion in log n / o ( @xmath6 0.02 dex ) at a given o abundance .",
    "( 2 ) the value of log n / o increases above @xmath9 1.60 along with the scatter at a given o abundance in bcgs with 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 .",
    "we interpret this increase in log n / o and its larger scatter as due to the additional contribution of primary nitrogen produced by intermediate - mass stars , on top of the primary nitrogen produced by massive stars .",
    "finally , we check whether the n / o ratios observed in more quiescent dwarf galaxies with less active star formation ( van zee et al . 1997 , 1998 ) are consistent with the scenario outlined above .",
    "the h ii regions in the latter have much lower excitation than those in bcgs , and the [ o iii ] @xmath244363 emission line is not seen in many galaxies . in the framework of a time delayed nitrogen production model , we would expect lower values of n / o abundance ratios in quiescent dwarf galaxies than in bcgs as the bursts in the former are older ( the h@xmath25 emission equivalent widths are smaller ) and more oxygen has been released relative to nitrogen .",
    "van zee et al . ( 1997 , 1998 ) do find some galaxies with very low log n / o @xmath0 1.7 .",
    "however , these low values are suspect and may be subject to systematic errors .",
    "there are several odd features concerning the galaxies with low n / o in the sample of van zee et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "first , they were all observed in the same run , the mean value of their log n / o in 9 h ii regions being 1.84 , while that for the rest of the sample observed during 4 other runs is 1.52 , in good agreement with the mean value found for bcgs .",
    "second , the derived extinctions for the low n / o galaxies are either zero or systematically lower than that of other galaxies observed in different runs .",
    "the h ii region ugc 5764 - 3 with the lowest log n / o = 2.02 has a h@xmath10/h@xmath25 intensity ratio of only 2.3 , much lower than the theoretical recombination value of 2.7  2.8 .",
    "we conclude therefore that there is no strong evidence in the quiescent dwarf galaxy data against a scenario of primary nitrogen production by high - mass stars in the galaxy metallicity range 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 .",
    "the fe / o abundance ratio also provides a very important constraint on the chemical evolution history of galaxies . til95",
    "first discussed the iron abundance in bcgs . from their small sample of 7 low - metallicity bcgs , they found that oxygen in these galaxies is overproduced relative to iron , as compared to the sun : [ o / fe ] = log ( fe / o)@xmath23  log ( fe / o ) = 0.34@xmath60.10 .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the [ o / fe ] observed for galactic halo stars ( barbuy 1988 ) , implying that the origin of iron in low - metallicity bcgs and in the galaxy prior the formation of halo stars is similar , and supporting the scenario of an early chemical enrichment of the galactic halo by massive stars .",
    "we have considerably increased the size of the sample of bcgs with iron abundance measurements . in figure 2c we show [ o / fe ] vs. 12 + log o / h for a total of 38 bcgs .",

    "the mean value of [ o / fe ] for the whole sample is 0.40@xmath60.14 ( table 5 ) .",
    "the only exception is the bcg sbs 0335052 which has a negative [ o / fe ] , i.e. oxygen is underabundant with respect to iron as compared to the sun .",
    "these odd abundances are not the result of observational errors as izotov et al .",
    "( 1997a ) derived a similar result from independent mmt observations .",

    "( 1997b ) shows that a narrow emission line at @xmath244658 superposed on top of the broad c iv @xmath244658 bump produced by the wr stars . the use of this narrow emission line to derive fe abundance results in an artificially low [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0.4 for the nw component of i zw 18 . on the other hand , the se component which does not possess wolf - rayet stars and hence has a nebular [ fe iii ] @xmath244658 emission line uncontaminated by narrow stellar c iv @xmath244658 emission , has a normal [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0.3 , consistent with the value derived by itl97 and with the mean value for the bcgs in our sample .",
    "we have plotted in figure 2c the [ o / fe ] value for the se component of i zw 18 .",

    "shows that the o / fe ratio in bcgs is nearly constant , irrespective of the oxygen abundance , at a value @xmath9 2.5 higher than in the solar neighborhood .        the remarkable constancy and small scatter of the c / o and n / o abundance ratios for the bcgs with oxygen abundance 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , and the similar behavior of the ne / o",
    ", si / o , s / o , ar / o and [ o / fe ] ratios with respect to the o abundance for all the bcgs in our sample provide an unique opportunity to compare the observed yields of massive stars with theoretical predictions , and put stringent constraints on nucleosynthetic models of low - metallicity massive stars .",
    "this comparison has generally been made for stars in the galaxy ( timmes et al .",
    "1995 ; samland 1998 ) . however , the galaxy is a complex evolved stellar system with the juxtaposition of many generations of stars . while its study gives the possibility to test models for a wide range of metallicities , the task is complex because the chemical enrichment is made not only by massive but also by intermediate and low - mass stars .",
    "additionally , heavy element abundance ratios in the galaxy may be modified by dynamical effects such as gas infall or outflow .",
    "bcgs are simple systems by comparison . as in the lowest - metallicity bcgs ,",
    "all heavy elements are made by massive stars only , the chemical enrichment of bcgs is insensitive to infall or outflow of material , and is dependent only on the characteristics of the initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar yields .",
    "a first comparison of observed stellar yields by massive stars with theoretical calculations has been made by til95 . since our observational sample",
    "is much increased and new calculations ( ww95 ) have appeared which cover a wider metallicity range ( til95 had only solar metallicity models to compare with ) , we revisit the problem here .",
    "table 6 shows the heavy element - to - oxygen yield ratios as derived from the observed abundance ratios .",
    "since intermediate - mass stars contribute significantly to the synthesis of c and n in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 , the observed yield ratios @xmath3(c)/@xmath3(o ) and @xmath3(n)/@xmath3(o ) were derived using bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , so that only the contribution from massive stars is taken into account . for the other elements ,",
    "the derived yields are simply the mean value of the abundance ratio for the whole sample . as for the theoretical yields given in table 6 , they are taken from ww95 and averaged over an imf with a salpeter slope in the stellar mass range 1  100 @xmath5 , for a heavy element mass fraction ranging from @xmath1 = 0 to @xmath2 .",
    "the 2 horizontal solid lines in figures 1 and 2 show , for all elements except n and fe , the range of theoretical yield ratios predicted by ww95 as determined by their models with metallicities 0 and 0.01 @xmath2 .",
    "inspection of table 6 and figures 1 and 2 shows that the heavy element yield ratios calculated by ww95 are generally not too far off from the yield ratios inferred from the observations . the model which fits best the observed ne / o and si / o ratios ( figures 1a and 1b ) has @xmath1 = 0 .",
    "models with @xmath1 @xmath8 0 predict a ne abundance too low by a factor of @xmath9 2 , while the predicted si abundance is too high by about the same factor .",
    "this anticorrelation can be explained by the fact that part of the ne produced is consumed in the later stages of hydrostatic burning , synthesizing si in particular .",
    "the observed s / o and ar / o abundance ratios ( figures 1c and 1d ) are best fitted by the @xmath1 = 0.01 @xmath2 and @xmath1 = 0.1 @xmath2 models which give nearly identical yields .",
    "the @xmath1 = 0 model predicts yields too low by a factor of @xmath9 1.3 . as for c / o ( figure 2a ) ,",
    "the @xmath1 = 0 and @xmath1 = 0.01 @xmath2 models , where c is produced only by massive stars and not by intermediate - mass stars , bracket nicely the data for bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath7 7.6 .",
    "it may seems surprising that the models which best fit elements such as ne and si have @xmath1 = 0 , considering that the bcgs in our sample all have @xmath1 @xmath4 0.02 @xmath2 .",
    "however , these heavy element abundances characterize the ionized gas , not the stars which can have a much lower metallicity .    because the most abundant ne isotope , @xmath45ne , is synthesized during hydrostatic carbon burning , it is not sensitive to uncertainties in explosive nucleosynthesis models .",
    "si , s and ar yields in massive stars are , on the other hand , sensitive to the treatment of the explosion .",
    "additionally , the production of these elements is sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors such as the rate of the @xmath46c(@xmath10,@xmath47)@xmath48o process , the treatment of semiconvection , the treatment of convection and convective overshoot mixing during the last stages of shell oxygen burning , the density structure near the iron core , the initial location of the mass cut , and the amount of mass that falls back in the explosion ( ww95 ) . given all these uncertainties , it is not so much the small discrepancies between theoretical and observational yield ratios that should be emphasized , but the overall good general agreement : it is remarkable that the abundance ratios inferred from the stellar yields by ww95 do not differ from those observed in bcgs by large factors , but are invariably in the ballpark .",
    "the calculated n and fe yields constitute exceptions : they do not agree well with the data .",
    "til95 have already discussed the problem of iron , for which the theoretical yields are @xmath9 2 times greater than those inferred from the observations .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that iron is produced during explosive nucleosynthesis by supernovae of both types i and ii in nearly equal quantities",
    ". however , the progenitors of sne ii are short - lived massive stars while the progenitors of sne ia are low - mass stars which explode only after 1 gyr .",
    "therefore , [ o / fe ] is a good estimator of the galaxy s age .",
    "the constancy of [ o / fe ] and its high value in bcgs as compared to the sun ( figure 2e ) implies that iron in bcgs was produced only by massive stars in type ii supernovae .",
    "because explosive nucleosynthesis models are sensitively dependent on the initial conditions of the explosion , the observed iron - to - oxygen abundance ratio can serve as a good discriminator between different models .",
    "til95 found that the models fit best the observations when the mass of the central collapsing core in the explosive synthesis is @xmath9 10% larger than the mass of the iron core .",
    "since the mean value of [ o / fe ] has not changed with the larger sample as compared to that found by til95 , this conclusion still holds with the new data .",
    "the discrepancy between theory and observation is much more important for n. the n yield inferred from observations is 1 to more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical yields of models with sub - solar metallicities ( table 6 ) .",
    "this is because conventional low - metallicity massive star models do not produce primary nitrogen .",
    "however , as noted by ww95 , it is possible that in some massive stars , the convective helium shell penetrates into the hydrogen layer with the consequent production of large amounts of primary nitrogen .",
    "in fact , timmes , woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) have found that the theoretical predictions for primary n production in massive stars with a large amount of convective overshoot are much more consistent with the observed [ n / fe ] in low - metallicity halo stars as compared to conventional models , in which nitrogen is produced only as a secondary element , despite the unknown details of convective overshoot .      while a picture where all heavy elements in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 are produced in high - mass stars ( hms ) only is consistent with the observations , the additional production of carbon and nitrogen by intermediate - mass stars ( ims ) needs to be taken into account in bcgs with oxygen abundance 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 .",
    "as already discussed , it is commonly thought that primary nitrogen in low - metallicity bcgs is produced only by intermediate - mass stars ( rv81 , ww95 ) .",
    "additionally , some nitrogen is produced as a secondary element in both intermediate and high - mass stars . however , because production of secondary nitrogen drops as metallicity decreases , it is expected that the amount of secondary nitrogen is negligible compared to that of primary nitrogen in low - metallicity bcgs . as for carbon",
    ", it is believed to be produced as a primary element in all stars more massive than 1.5 @xmath5 ( rv81 , ww95 ) .",
    "we compare in table 7 the observed c / o and n / o abundance ratios with theoretical predictions , taking into account the contributions of both high and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "as before , all theoretical ratios are imf - averaged values with the salpeter slope of 2.35 and lower and upper mass limits of 1 and 100 @xmath5 respectively .",
    "theoretical yields for massive stars in the mass range 12  40 @xmath5 and with a heavy element mass fraction @xmath1 = 0.0002 are taken from ww95 . since production of primary nitrogen by massive stars is not considered by these authors , we adopt as the primary n yield by massive stars that which is consistent with the observed @xmath7log n / o@xmath8 = 1.60 for low - metallicity bcgs ( table 7 and solid horizontal line in figure 2b ) . as for the c and n yields for intermediate - mass stars ,",
    "they are taken from two different sets of models .",
    "the first set of models is from rv81 .",
    "they are characterized by a stellar mass range from 3.5 to 7 @xmath5 , a mass loss efficiency parameter on the asymptotic giant branch @xmath49 = 0.33 , and a mixing length parameter @xmath10 = 1.5 .",
    "the other set of models is from hg97 .",
    "they are characterized by @xmath1 = 0.001 and a standard scaling parameter related to the efficiency of mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch @xmath49 = 1 .",
    "we shall argue in section 5 that the high value of [ o / fe ] with respect to the sun in the bcgs studied here implies that they are not older than @xmath9 1  2 gyr .",
    "therefore , we have only considered yields from hg97 for stars with a lifetime less than 1 gyr , i.e. with mass @xmath4 2 @xmath5 .",
    "we assume furthermore that oxygen is produced by massive stars only .",
    "we do not give in table 7 the value of c / o in the case of c production by intermediate - mass stars only , as this situation is not realistic : c produced by longer - lived intermediate - mass stars is always accompanied by c produced by shorter - lived massive stars .",
    "it is evident from table 7 that there is general good agreement between observations and theory for c / o .",
    "we have already discussed the agreement for low - metallicity bcgs with oxygen abundance 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 where c is produced by massive stars only .",
    "the agreement is as good for higher - metallicity bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 , if c is produced in both massive and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we have plotted in figure 2a by a horizontal dashed line the theoretical c / o ratio calculated with models by ww95 for high mass stars and by rv81 for intermediate - mass stars .",
    "this value should be considered as an upper limit as the production of oxygen by massive stars in the current burst of star formation lowers the observed c / o ratios .",
    "the latter should lie between a lower limit set by primary c production by massive stars alone and whose possible range is shown by the two horizontal solid lines in figure 2a , and that upper limit .",
    "the data points for bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 do indeed scatter between these two limits as expected .",
    "using the hg97 models would give a lower upper limit ( by a factor of 1.6 ) , but this is still consistent with the data given the observational uncertainties .    the situation for nitrogen",
    "is more complex . if nitrogen is produced only by intermediate mass stars ( and oxygen only by massive stars ) , then the rv81 and hg97 models predict respectively log n / o = 1.27 and 0.84 .",
    "while these values are consistent with the largest n / o ratios observed for the bcgs in our sample with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 ( figure 2b ) , n production by intermediate - mass stars alone can not explain , as discussed before , the very small dispersion of n / o ratios in bcgs with lower metallicities , so we do not consider this scenario further .",
    "we examine therefore the picture where nitrogen is produced by both high and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "if nitrogen is produced only as a secondary element in massive stars , then the predicted log n / o is too small , @xmath0 2.37 for massive star models with @xmath1 @xmath0 0.1 @xmath2 ( table 6 ) .",
    "we have thus to consider the situation where the nitrogen produced in massive stars is primary . in this case , the combined ( hms + ims ) nitrogen and oxygen production gives log n / o = 1.11 and 0.77 for the rv81 and hg97 models respectively . as in the case of the c / o ratio , these values should be considered as upper limits .",
    "we have shown in figure 2b by a dashed horizontal line the upper limit corresponding to the rv81 model .",
    "the data are completely consistent with the latter model : all the bcgs points fall within the dashed line and the lower limit set by primary n production in massive stars only ( solid line ) .",
    "it is important to stress here that in this picture , no bcg can have a n / o ( or c / o ) ratio below the value set by massive star evolution , as indicated by the solid lines in figure 2a ( and 2b ) .",
    "we have already discussed in sections 4.2 and 4.3 that we know of no reliable data which contradict that statement .    in summary ,",
    "the comparison of observational and theoretical yields shows a remarkably good general agreement in spite many uncertain parameters in the models . with the presently available data , the rv81 yields appear to give a slightly better fit to the data than the hg97 yields , although both sets are consistent with it within the observational uncertainties .",
    "it is also clear that further development of massive star nucleosynthesis theory is needed , especially concerning nitrogen and iron productions .",
    "because the theoretical yields of some elements are still so uncertain , we feel it is best to use , in computing chemical evolution models , the empirical yields derived from observations of low - metallicity bcgs , as summarized in table 6 .",
    "the analysis of the behavior of the heavy element abundance ratios as a function of oxygen abundance has shown that chemical enrichment proceeds differently in bcgs with low and high oxygen abundance . in bcgs with 12 + log",
    "o / h @xmath0 7.6 , high - mass stars are the main agents of chemical enrichment , the very small dispersion of the abundance ratios ruling out the time - delayed production of carbon and nitrogen by intermediate - mass stars . on the other hand , in higher metallicity bcgs with 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 , the contribution of intermediate - mass stars to heavy element enrichment is significant , as evidenced by an increase in the values and dispersions of the c / o and n / o ratios .",
    "one might expect therefore that the he enrichment history is also different in these two ranges of oxygen abundances , as helium is produced in different proportions by high and intermediate - mass stars .    in figure 3",
    "we show the helium mass fraction @xmath50 as a function of oxygen abundance for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "all of them possess accurate he abundance determination as the present sample is precisely the one used by izotov & thuan ( 1998b ) to derive the primordial helium abundance @xmath51 .",
    "it is usual practice to extrapolate the @xmath50 versus o / h and @xmath50 versus n / h linear regressions to o / h = n / h = 0 to derive @xmath51 ( peimbert & torres - peimbert 1974 , 1976 ; pagel , terlevich & melnick 1986 ) .",
    "the @xmath50 versus o / h regression line is decribed by @xmath52    the dotted line in figure 3 represents the best fit regression line as derived by izotov & thuan ( 1998b ) , with d@xmath50/d@xmath1 = 2.4 which corresponds to d@xmath50/d(o / h ) = 45 .",
    "we now compare this best fit slope with the ones predicted in various models . in the scenario of element production in high - mass stars only for bcgs with 12 + log",
    "o / h @xmath0 7.6 or o / h @xmath0 4@xmath2110@xmath53 , the predicted slope ( ww95 ) is much shallower , d@xmath50/d@xmath1 = 0.94 ( table 7 ) .",
    "the solid line in figure 3 has this slope ( we adopt @xmath51= 0.244 , izotov & thuan 1998b ) .",
    "it can be seen that it fits quite well the lowest - metallicity points , and is in fact nearly indistinguishable from the best fit line . at higher oxygen abundances ,",
    "the slope steepens because of the additional production of helium in intermediate mass stars and takes the values d@xmath50/d@xmath1 = 1.66 and 1.54 for the rv81 and hg97 yields respectively ( table 7 ) .",
    "these values are lower than the best fit slope d@xmath50/d@xmath1 = 2.4@xmath61.0 , but are consistent with it within the errors .",
    "the dashed line in figure 3 has the slope derived with the rv81 yields .",
    "taking into account the error bars , it fits the observations quite well . we shall need to supplement our bcg sample with more high - metallicity bcgs to determine d@xmath50/d@xmath1 better , and reduce the observational uncertainties in the individual he determinations , before we can ascertain whether there is any difference between the best fit slope and the one derived from theory .",
    "given the present data , we conclude that our proposed scenario  he production in high - mass stars only for galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , and he production by both high and intermediate - mass stars for higher metallicity galaxies  is in good agreement with the observations . if we assume that 25% of the oxygen produced is lost by the galaxy due to supernova - driven winds , then d@xmath50/d@xmath1 is nearly unchanged at low metallicities because both oxygen and helium are produced in massive stars .",
    "however , when intermediate - mass stars play a role in producing he ( but not o ) , the slope steepens , becoming 1.89 instead of 1.66 .",
    "the above analysis implies that a slope change may be expected for the @xmath50 versus o / h linear regression at 12 + log o / h @xmath9 7.6 , and that fitting both the low and high metallicity ranges by the same slope may introduce some systematic underestimation of @xmath51 .",
    "if this is the case , it is perhaps best to derive @xmath51 not by a regression fit , but by taking the mean @xmath50 of the most metal - deficient galaxies . itl97 and izotov & thuan ( 1998b )",
    "did indeed find that the mean @xmath50 of the two most metal - deficient bcgs known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , is higher by 0.001 than the value derived from a linear regression fit to the whole sample ( @xmath7@xmath50@xmath8 = 0.245@xmath60.004 instead of @xmath51 = 0.244@xmath60.002 ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure 3 , the difference between the regression line derived by fitting the data with the same slope over the whole metallicity range and that expected for he production by massive stars only , is small and far below the observational uncertainties .",
    "we conclude therefore that , given the present quality of the data , the method of using a single linear regression ( eq . [ eq : yvso ] ) with the same d@xmath50/d@xmath1 slope over the whole metallicity range is perfectly adequate for the determination of the primordial helium abundance .",
    "we next examine the behavior of he with respect to c in the context of our favored model : he and heavy - element production by high - mass stars only in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath7 7.6 , and by both high - mass and intermediate - mass stars in higher metallicity bcgs . in figure 4",
    "we show the dependence of the helium mass fraction @xmath50 on the carbon abundance c / h for those bcgs in our sample for which both of these quantities are known .",
    "admittedly , the total number of such galaxies is very small ( only 4 ) , too small to draw any definite conclusion on the slope of the @xmath50  c / h relation .",
    "the solid line shows the expected relation when he and c are only produced by high - mass stars , and the dashed line that expected when both high and intermediate - mass stars contribute .",
    "the theoretical imf - averaged yields are taken from ww95 for high - mass stars and from rv81 for intermediate - mass stars . despite the very small number of data points",
    ", it can be seen that the theoretical predictions agree well with the observational data .",
    "we give in table 7 the theoretical slopes d@xmath50/d(c / h ) in both situations ( hms and ims+hms ) , for two sets of yields for intermediate - mass stars taken from rv81 and hg97 . while the slopes in the case of hg97 yields are nearly the same in both situations , the slope with rv81 yields is shallower when both high and intermediate - mass stars produce he and c than when only high - mass stars are responsible for the nucleosynthesis .",
    "because o , ne , si , s and ar are made in the same high - mass stars , their abundance ratios with respect to o are constant and not sensitive to the age of the galaxy .",
    "by contrast , c , n and fe can be produced by both high and lower - mass stars , and their abundance ratios with respect to o can give important information on the evolutionary status of bcgs .",
    "the constancy of [ o / fe ] for the bcgs in our sample and its high value compared to the sun ( figure 2c ) suggests that all iron was produced by massive stars , i.e. in sne ii only .",
    "since the time delay between iron production from sne ii and sne ia is about 1  2 gyr , it is likely that bcgs with oxygen abundance less than 12 + log o / h @xmath9 8.2 are younger than 1  2 gyr , assuming that abundances measured in the supergiant h ii regions are representative for the whole galaxy .",
    "we can not put more stringent constraints on the star formation history of bcgs with the [ o / fe ] abundance ratio because intermediate - mass stars do not produce oxygen and iron .",
    "we next use the behavior of the c / o and n / o ratios as a function of oxygen abundance to constrain the age of bcgs . as discussed previously",
    ", this behavior is very different whether the bcg has 12 + log o / h smaller or greater than 7.6 .",
    "the c / o and n / o abundance ratios in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 are independent of the oxygen abundance and show a very small scatter about the mean value .",
    "we have argued that this small scatter rules out any time - delay model in which o is produced first by massive stars and c and n are produced later by intermediate - mass stars , and supports a common origin of c , n and o in the same first - generation massive stars .",
    "thus , it is very likely that the presently observed episode of star formation in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 is the first one in the history of the galaxy and the age of the oldest stars in it do not exceed @xmath9 40 myr , the lifetime of a 9 @xmath5 star .",
    "the conclusion that bcgs with @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath2/20 are young is supported by the analysis of _ hst _ wfpc2 images of some of these galaxies .",
    "hunter & thronson ( 1995 ) have concluded that the blue colors of the underlying diffuse extended emission in i zw 18 ( @xmath2/50 ) are consistent with those from a sea of unresolved b and early a stars , with no evidence for stars older than @xmath9 10@xmath15 yr .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and thuan , izotov & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) have also found in sbs 0335052 ( @xmath2/41 ) , after removal of the gaseous emission , an extremely blue extended underlying stellar component with age less than 100 myr . in the same manner , sbs 1415 + 437 ( @xmath2/21 , thuan , izotov & foltz 1998 ) , t1214277 and tol 65 ( respectively @xmath2/21 and @xmath2/22 , izotov , thuan & papaderos 1998 ) show , after subtraction of the gaseous emission , a very blue extended emission consistent with an underlying stellar population not older than 100 myr .",
    "the situation changes for bcgs with @xmath1 @xmath8 @xmath2/20 .",
    "the scatter of the c / o and n / o ratios increases significantly at a given o abundance , which we interpret as due to the additional production of primary n by intermediate - mass stars , on top of the primary n production by high - mass stars .",
    "thus , since it takes at least 500 myr ( the lifetime of a 2  3 @xmath5 star ) for c and n to be produced by intermediate - mass stars , bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 must have had several episodes of star formation before the present one and they must be at least older than @xmath9 100 myr .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with photometric studies of these higher metallicity bcgs which , unlike their very low - metallicity counterparts , have a red old instead of a blue young underlying stellar component ( loose & thuan 1985 ; papaderos et al . 1996 ; telles & terlevich 1997 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the study of heavy element abundances in bcgs leads us to the following timeline for galaxy evolution : a ) all objects with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 began to form stars less than 40 myr ago ; b ) after 40 myr , all galaxies have evolved so that 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 ; c ) by the time intermediate - mass stars have evolved and released their nucleosynthetic products ( 100500 myr ) , all galaxies have become enriched to 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 .",

    "lu , sargent & barlow ( 1998 ) have measured n / si abundance ratios in 15 damped ly@xmath10 galaxies , and have set upper limits for log n / o ranging from from 1.2 to 2.1 . until now , nearly all log n / o measurements lower than the bcg lower limit of 1.60 in damped ly@xmath10 systems are upper limits .",
    "there is however one exception , the 1946 + 7658 system where lu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) did measure an actual value , [ n / si ] = 1.70 which translates to log n / o = 2.6 , or 1.0 dex lower than the bcg lower limit . from the n / o and n / si measurements , pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) concluded that both primary and secondary nitrogen production are important over the whole range of metallicity measured in damped ly@xmath10 systems , while lu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) favor the time - delayed primary nitrogen production by intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we find such a large difference between the n / o ratios measured in bcgs and those in damped ly@xmath10 galaxies to be very puzzling .",
    "if we believe the physics of star formation , the stellar imf and the nucleosynthesis processes in stars at a given metallicity , to be universal and independent of cosmic epoch , then there must be some systematic differences in the way in which the n / o ratios are derived in damped ly@xmath10 systems as compared to those in bcgs .",
    "the derivation of n / o ratios in bcgs is straightforward enough .",
    "the photoionized h ii region models are simple and well defined , the nebular emission lines are strong and their intensities can be measured with precision . there is no hidden assumption in the path from line intensities to n and o abundances . on the other hand , there is a basic assumption in the derivation of n / o in damped ly@xmath10 systems which we would like to discuss .",
    "it is generally assumed that absorption lines in damped ly@xmath10 systems originate in the h i clouds in the disk of the galaxy . in this case , only low ionization species are expected and correction factors for unseen stages of ionization are close to unity ( viegas 1995 ) .",
    "we suggest here that this basic assumption may not be valid .",
    "we may expect that in high - redshift gas - rich disks there is ongoing star formation giving birth to massive stars which ionize the h i gas and create h ii regions and diffuse ionized gas .",
    "there is thus a non - zero probability for the line of sight to cross diffuse ionized gas which is ubiquitous and has a large covering factor in gas - rich galaxies and/or hii regions , so that absorption lines would originate not in neutral but ionized gas .",
    "supporting this hypothesis is the fact that many of the spectra of lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) do show absorption lines of high ionization species such as al iii , c iv and si iv , which are usually present in ionized gas regions .",
    "lu et al . (",
    "1996 ) have dismissed the ionized gas hypothesis by the following two arguments .",
    "first , the absorption profile of the high - ionization species al iii is similar to those of lower ionization species , and hence both types of species must be produced in the same physical region .",
    "the latter must be mostly neutral because of the large observed h i column densities . in that case",
    ", al iii comes from an ionized shell surrounding the h i gas .",
    "second , the al ii lines are always much stronger than the al iii lines , so that @xmath54(al ii ) @xmath55 @xmath54(al iii ) implying that most of the gas where the absorption arises is neutral .",
    "the last argument is not airtight .",
    "supposing that all absorption lines originate not in h i but h ii gas , we have constructed with the radiative - collisional equilibrium code cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) a series of spherically symmetric h ii region models with the ionization parameter log u in the range 0.4 to 0 which is typical for hii regions , and ionizing stars with effective temperatures between 40 000 and 50 000 k and a metallicity of one - tenth solar .",
    "for these models , typical radially - averaged column densities are @xmath54(h ii ) = 10@xmath5610@xmath57 @xmath41 and @xmath54(al ii ) = 10@xmath4610@xmath43 @xmath41 .",
    "the models give invariably @xmath54(al ii ) @xmath8 @xmath54(al iii ) even when the hydrogen gas is totally ionized .",
    "the profile similarities noted by lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) between al iii and al ii can indeed be explained by the formation of absorption lines in the same physical region , but the latter can be h ii rather than h i gas .",
    "if the gas is ionized , the correction factors for unseen stages of ionization are dependent on the parameters of the particular h ii region model and will be higher than for those in a h i cloud .",
    "the determination of abundances is more uncertain because of the lack of information on the column density of ionized hydrogen .",
    "however , the abundance ratios for some elements will not change greatly when the absorption lines are assumed to originate in the h ii instead of the h i gas .",
    "this is because the abundances of these elements are derived from column densities of singly ionized ions , e.g. c@xmath26 , si@xmath26 , s@xmath26 , fe@xmath26 .",
    "photoionized h ii region models ( stasiska 1990 ) predict for these ions similar correction factors , so that their ratios are close to unity and the element abundance ratios are roughly equal to the singly ionized ion abundance ratios",
    ". however , the situation changes dramatically when we compare abundances of elements derived from column densities of ions in different stages of ionization . in those cases",
    ", the ratio of the ionization correction factors for different elements can be very far from unity , and the abundance ratios very different from the ion abundance ratios .",
    "such is the case for the n / si abundance ratio .",
    "while the silicon column density is derived from the si@xmath26 absorption line equivalent widths , the nitrogen column density is derived from the n@xmath58 absorption lines . in the h",
    "i cloud model @xmath59 the situation is however totally different if the h ii region model is adopted . in figure 5",
    "we show the correction factors icf(n / si ) as a function of the fraction of o@xmath26 ions @xmath60(o@xmath26 ) = o@xmath26/o , for the set of h ii region models of stasiska ( 1990 ) .",
    "the correction factors icf(n / si ) are weakly dependent on @xmath60(o@xmath26 ) and have a lower envelope at a value @xmath9 10 .",
    "hence , for the h ii region model @xmath61 this factor of @xmath9 10 is just about the one needed to bring the n / o ratio measured in the 1946 + 7658 damped ly@xmath10 system to the mean value of n / o obtained for low - metallicity bcgs .    instead of the n / si ratio , pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have measured directly the n / o ratio in the damped ly@xmath10 systems .",
    "this method is in principle subject to less uncertainties because the abundances of both elements in the h ii region are derived from column densities of neutral species .",
    "we have run the cloudy code for several spherically symmetric h ii region models , varying the ionization parameter and the temperature of the ionizing radiation .",
    "these calculations show that the fractions of neutral nitrogen and neutral oxygen in the h ii region along the line of sight are nearly the same , i.e. @xmath62 however , the o abundance is not known with good precision .",
    "the o i @xmath241302 absorption line is saturated and the o abundances derived by pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) by fitting the saturated o i profiles have so large errors that they span 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the very method of using saturated absorption lines to derive column densities and abundances is questionable ( pettini et al .",
    "1995 ; pettini & lipman 1995 ; lu et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we stress therefore that there is a great uncertainty in the derived n / o abundance ratios in damped ly@xmath10 absorption systems .",
    "this uncertainty comes in large part from our ignorance of the nature of the absorbing medium , whether it is neutral or ionized gas .",
    "if the absorbing system is an h ii region instead of a h i cloud , the derived n / o abundance ratio may increase by a factor of 10 or more if the si@xmath63 lines are used instead of neutral oxygen lines , which would bring the n / o ratios derived in damped ly@xmath10 systems in closer agreement with those found in low - metallicity bcgs .",
    "another large source of uncertainty comes from the derivation of abundances from saturated o i @xmath241302 absorption lines .",
    "if in the future , there is evidence that the absorption lines do come from a neutral medium , and better o determinations in damped ly@xmath10 systems still give a n / o ratio a whole order of magnitude lower than the value found in low - metallicity bcgs , then we would have to conclude that star formation and metal dispersal histories in damped ly@xmath10 galaxies are very different from those in bcgs .",
    "the present study is a continuation and extension of the one by til95 on heavy element abundances in very metal - deficient environments , with considerably more data .",
    "we derive here the abundances of n , o , ne , s , ar and fe in a sample of 54 supergiant h ii regions in 50 low - metallicity blue compact galaxies with oxygen abundance in the range 7.1 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.3 . the objects in this sample all possess very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra which have been obtained for the determination of the primordial helium abundance .",
    "this allows us to measure line intensities with a high precision , and properly correct them for interstellar extinction and underlying stellar hydrogen balmer absorption .",
    "in addition , we redetermine the carbon and silicon abundances in some bcgs with the use of _ hst _ uv and optical archival spectra , supplemented in a few cases by ground - based optical spectroscopic observations to derive accurate electron temperatures .      \\1 . as in til95 ,",
    "the @xmath10-elements - to - oxygen ne / o , si / o , s / o and ar / o abundance ratios show no dependence on oxygen abundance over the whole range of metallicities studied here .",
    "furthermore , these ratios are about the same as those found in halo stars and high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 galaxies , and they have approximately the solar values .",
    "this result is to be expected from stellar nucleosynthesis theory as oxygen and all @xmath10-elements are produced by the same massive stars .",
    "we rederive the carbon - to - oxygen abundance ratio in both nw and se components of i zw 18 , the most metal - deficient galaxy known .",
    "our values of log c / o = 0.77@xmath60.10 for the nw component and 0.74@xmath60.09 for the se component are in excellent agreement with those predicted by the theory of massive star nucleosynthesis , but are significantly lower ( by @xmath9 0.2 dex ) than those derived by garnett et al .",
    "the main source of the differences comes from the adopted electron temperatures .",
    "we use higher electron temperatures ( by 1900 k and 2300 k respectively for the nw and se components ) , as derived from recent mmt spectral observations ( izotov et al .",
    "1997b ) in apertures which match more closely those of the _ hst _ fos observations used to obtain c abundances . with these lower c / o ratios ,",
    "i zw 18 does not stand apart anymore from the other low - metallicity bcgs .",
    "an earlier lower - mass carbon - producing stellar population need not be invoked , and i zw 18 can still be a  primeval \" galaxy undergoing its first burst of star formation .",
    "the c / o abundance ratio is constant , independent of the o abundance in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 ( @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath2/20 ) , with a mean value log c / o = 0.78@xmath60.03 and a very small dispersion about the mean .",
    "this result is based on a small sample of 4 data points in 3 galaxies and needs to be strengthened by more c / o measurements in extremely metal - deficient galaxies .",
    "the constancy of the c / o ratio suggests that carbon in these galaxies is produced in the same stars that make o , i.e. only in massive stars ( @xmath3 @xmath8 9 @xmath5 ) .",
    "by contrast , the c / o ratio in bcgs with higher oxygen abundance ( 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 ) is significantly higher , with a mean value log c / o = 0.52@xmath60.08 and a larger dispersion about the mean . this enhanced c / o ratio and the larger scatter at a given o / h are likely the result of additional carbon production by intermediate - mass ( 3 @xmath5 @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath0 9 @xmath5 ) stars , on top of the carbon production by high - mass stars .",
    "til95 showed that the n / o abundance ratio has a very small scatter in bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 , with a mean value log n / o = 1.58@xmath60.02 .",
    "we have added here a very low - metallicity object , sbs 0335052 with @xmath2/41 , and the results do not change . as discussed by til95 , such a small dispersion of the n / o",
    "ratio is not consistent a time - delayed production of primary nitrogen by longer - lived intermediate - mass stars in these extremely metal - deficient galaxies .",
    "the small dispersion at very low metallicities can only be explained by primary nitrogen production in short - lived massive stars .",
    "as in the case of c , galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 show a considerably larger scatter of n / o ratios , with a mean value log n / o = 1.46@xmath60.14 .",
    "again , the larger scatter can be explained by the addition of primary nitrogen production in intermediate - mass stars , on top of that in massive stars .",
    "none of our galaxies has log n / o below 1.67 , implying that the lower envelope of the n / o distribution is set by the production of primary nitrogen in massive stars over the whole range of metallicities studied here , 7.1 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 .",
    "while a detailed scenario of primary nitrogen production by massive stars is yet to be developed , the mean log n / o obtained here for the most metal - deficient bcgs will put strong constraints on any future theory .",
    "the fe / o abundance ratio in our bcgs is @xmath9 2.5 times lower than in the sun , with a mean [ o / fe ] = 0.40@xmath60.14 .",
    "again , it does not show any dependence on oxygen abundance , in agreement with til95 .",
    "this implies that iron in bcgs was synthesised during the explosive nucleosynthesis of sne ii .",
    "only one bcg bucks the trend : sbs 0335052 has a fe / o abundance ratio higher than the solar ratio .",
    "we argue that the high abundance of fe in this bcg may not be real , and may be caused by the contamination of the nebular [ fe iii ] @xmath244658 emission line by the narrow stellar c iv @xmath244658 produced in expanding envelopes of hot massive stars .",
    "comparison of theoretical heavy element yields for low - metallicity massive stars ( ww95 ) with those inferred from observations of bcgs shows that the theory of massive star nucleosynthesis is generally in good shape .",
    "the major problems are with iron and nitrogen yields .",
    "the predicted iron - to - oxygen yield ratio is a factor of @xmath9 2 larger than the observed ratio .",
    "models of primary nitrogen production by intermediate - mass stars can not reproduce the n / o ratios observed in very low - metallicity bcgs , and conventional models of low - metallicity massive stars do not allow for primary nitrogen production . until further developments of the theory of massive star nucleosynthesis",
    "resolve these disagreements , it is best to use the observed yields given in table 6 for studies of the early chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "helium follows the same pattern as carbon and nitrogen .",
    "the helium abundance is constant within the observational uncertainties for bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 .",
    "again we interpret this constancy by he being produced in high - mass stars only . at higher oxygen abundances , the mean and dispersion increase , and we again interpret this increase as the addition of helium production by intermediate - mass stars to that by massive stars .",
    "although the sources of helium production appear to be different in low and high - metallicity bcgs , implying slightly different dependences of the helium mass fraction @xmath50 on oxygen abundance above and below 12 + log o / h = 7.6 , we find that the commonly used @xmath50 versus o / h linear regression over a large range of oxygen abundances to determine the primordial helium abundance , is a good approximation .",
    "the constancy of the c / o , n / o and [ o / fe ] ratios in bcgs with 12 + log",
    "o / h @xmath0 7.6 argues strongly for the production in the most metal - deficient galaxies , of these elements by massive stars only .",
    "intermediate - mass stars have not yet returned their nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium in these most metal - poor galaxies because they have not had enough time to evolve .",
    "this allows us to date these galaxies .",
    "galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 are young , in the sense that they have experienced their first episode of star formation not more than @xmath9 40 myr ago , the lifetime of a 9 @xmath5 star .",
    "this derived young age is in agreement with the results obtained by recent photometric studies with _ hst _ images of some of the most metal - deficient galaxies discussed here .",
    "the study of heavy element abundances in bcgs leads us to the following timeline for galaxy evolution : a ) all objects with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 began to form stars less than 40 myr ago ; b ) after 40 myr , all galaxies have evolved so that 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 ; c ) by the time intermediate - mass stars have evolved and released their nucleosynthetic products ( 100500 myr ) , all galaxies have become enriched to 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 .",
    "the delayed release of primary n at these metallicities greatly increase the scatter in the n / o abundance ratio ; d ) later , when galaxies get enriched to 12 + log o / h @xmath8 8.2 , secondary n",
    "production becomes important .",
    "the n / o abundance ratios derived for bcgs are apparently larger by a factor of up to @xmath9 10 than those obtained for high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 galaxies ( lu et al .",
    "we suggest here that this discrepancy may not be real .",
    "contrary to the situation for bcgs where the n / o ratios are very well determined , the n / o ratios derived for damped ly@xmath10 systems are highly uncertain because of the unknown physical conditions in the interstellar medium of high - redshift systems .",
    "it is generally assumed that the absorption lines in these systems originate in the h i gas . in that case ,",
    "the ionization correction factors for the low - ionization species used for abundance determination are close to unity . however , if we assume that the absorption lines originate not in neutral but ionized gas , the correction factors can be @xmath4 10 , and the derived n / o abundance ratios in the damped ly@xmath10 systems can be as high as those derived in bcgs .",

    "<S> we present high - quality ground - based spectroscopic observations of 54 supergiant h ii regions in 50 low - metallicity blue compact galaxies with oxygen abundances 12 + log o / h between 7.1 and 8.3 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the data to determine abundances for the elements n , o , ne , s , ar and fe . we also analyze _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ hst _ ) faint object spectrograph archival spectra of 10 supergiant h ii regions to derive c and si abundances in a subsample of 7 bcgs . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of the present study is that _ none _ of the heavy element - to - oxygen abundance ratios studied here ( c / o , n / o , ne / o , si / o , s / o , ar / o , fe / o ) depend on oxygen abundance for bcgs with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 ( @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath2/20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this constancy implies that all these heavy elements have a primary origin and are produced by the same massive ( @xmath3 @xmath4 10 @xmath5 ) stars responsible for o production . the dispersion of the c / o and n / o ratios in these galaxies is found to be remarkably small , being only @xmath6 0.03 dex and @xmath6 0.02 dex respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this very small dispersion is strong evidence against any time - delayed production of c and primary n in the lowest - metallicity bcgs ( secondary n production is negligible at these low metallicities ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a time - delayed production of c and n is consistent with the scenario that galaxies with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 are undergoing now their _ first _ burst of star formation , and that they are therefore _ young _ , with ages not exceeding 40 myr . </S>",
    "<S> if very low metallicities bcgs are indeed young , this would argue against the commonly held belief that c and n are produced by intermediate - mass ( 3 @xmath5 @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath0 9 @xmath5 ) stars at very low metallicities , as these stars would not have yet completed their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies . in higher metallicity bcgs ( 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 ) , the ne / o , si / o , s / o , ar / o and fe / o abundance ratios retain the same constant value they had at lower metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , there is an increase of the c / o and n / o ratios along with their dispersions at a given o. we interpret this increase as due to the additional contribution of c and primary n production in intermediate - mass stars , on top of that by high - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> the above results lead to the following timeline for galaxy evolution : a ) all objects with 12 + log o / h @xmath0 7.6 began to form stars less than 40 myr ago ; b ) after 40 myr , all galaxies have evolved so that 12 + log o / h @xmath8 7.6 ; c ) by the time intermediate - mass stars have evolved and released their nucleosynthetic products ( 100500 myr ) , all galaxies have become enriched to 7.6 @xmath7 12 + log o / h @xmath7 8.2 . the delayed release of primary n at these metallicities greatly increase the scatter in the n / o abundance ratio ; d ) later , when galaxies get enriched to 12 + log o / h @xmath8 8.2 , secondary n production becomes important .    </S>",
    "<S> bcgs show the same o / fe overabundance with respect to the sun ( @xmath9 0.4 dex ) as galactic halo stars , suggesting the same chemical enrichment history . </S>",
    "<S> we compare heavy elements yields derived from the observed abundance ratios with theoretical yields for massive stars and find general good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> however , the theoretical models are unable to reproduce the observed n / o and fe / o abundance ratios . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical developments are necessary , in particular to solve the problem of primary nitrogen production in low - metallicity massive stars .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the apparent discrepancy between the n / o abundance ratios measured in bcgs and those in high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 galaxies , which are up to one order of magnitude smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this large discrepancy may arise from the unknown physical conditions of the gas responsible for the metallic absorption lines in high - redshift damped ly@xmath10 systems . </S>",
    "<S> while it is widely assumed that the absorbing gas is neutral , we propose that it could be ionized . in this case , ionization correction factors can boost the n / o ratios in damped ly@xmath10 galaxies into the range of those measured in bcgs .    </S>",
