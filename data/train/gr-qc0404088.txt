    "space - time diffeomorphisms form a gauge symmetry of classical general relativity .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the fact that the theory can be formulated in a coordinate - free fashion and that the classical observables are able to probe only the coordinate - independent aspects of space - time physics ,  they probe the ` geometry ' of space - time which always means ` geometry up to diffeomorphism ' .",
    "the classical histories of the gravitational field in the covariant lagrangian language are therefore the equivalence classes of space - time geometries modulo diffeomorphism .    in the present article , we consider path integral quantizations of classical general relativity in @xmath3 space - time dimensions in which the path integral is a sum over the histories of the gravitational field .",
    "for any given smooth @xmath3-dimensional space - time manifold @xmath4 with boundary @xmath5 , the path integral  @xcite with suitable boundary conditions is supposed to yield transition amplitudes between quantum states ( equation   below ) .",
    "the states correspond to wave functionals on a suitable set of configurations that represent @xmath6-geometries on the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "the only background structure involved is the differentiable structure of @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that path integrals of this type are closely related to topological quantum field theories ( tqfts )  @xcite . in order to avoid possible misunderstandings of this connection right in the beginning",
    ", we stress that in the case of general relativity in @xmath0 , there is no reason to require that the vector spaces [ or modules ] in the axioms of  @xcite be finite - dimensional [ finitely generated ] .",
    "in fact , it is believed that tqfts with finite - dimensional vector spaces would be insufficient and unable to capture the propagating modes of general relativity in @xmath0 .",
    "a similar argument is thought to apply to general relativity in @xmath2 if coupled to certain matter , for example , to a scalar field .",
    "we also stress that in the literature , the letter ` t ' in tqft does not necessarily refer to topological manifolds .",
    "in fact , the entire formalism of tqfts is usually set up in the framework of smooth manifolds  @xcite , and unless @xmath7 , the structure of smooth manifolds is in general rather different from that of topological manifolds .",
    "one should therefore distinguish smooth from topological manifolds and relate the path integral of general relativity to a tqft that uses smooth manifolds .",
    "we call such a theory a @xmath8-qft .",
    "in contrast to the smooth case , we will subsequently use the term @xmath9-qft for a tqft that refers to topological manifolds .",
    "one application of the connection of general relativity with @xmath8-qfts is that the partition function which can be computed from the path integral , forms ( at least formally ) an invariant of smooth manifolds  @xcite .",
    "results on the classification of topological , piecewise - linear and smooth manifolds which we review in this article , can then be used in order to narrow down some properties of the path integral . in dimension @xmath7 ,",
    "smooth manifolds up to diffeomorphism are already characterized by their underlying topological manifolds up to homeomorphism .",
    "this means that in these dimensions , the @xmath8-qft of general relativity is in fact a @xmath9-qft which makes the colloquial assertion precise that pure general relativity in @xmath2 is a ` topological ' theory .",
    "the same is no longer true in @xmath0 .",
    "a given topological @xmath10-manifold can rather admit many inequivalent differentiable structures so that in @xmath0 , there is a highly non - trivial difference between @xmath8-qfts and @xmath9-qfts .",
    "the invariants of donaldson  @xcite or seiberg ",
    "witten  @xcite can indeed be understood as partition functions of ( generalized ) @xmath8-qfts  @xcite which are sharp enough to detect the inequivalence of differentiable structures on the same underlying topological manifold .",
    "the partition function of quantum general relativity in @xmath0 , if it can indeed be constructed , will offer the same potential .",
    "this relationship is the main theme of the present article .",
    "the special role of space - time dimension @xmath0 in differential topology is summarized by the following result .",
    "[ thm_intro ] let @xmath4 be a compact topological @xmath3-manifold , @xmath11 ( without boundary if @xmath12 ) .",
    "if @xmath4 admits an infinite number of pairwise inequivalent differentiable structures , then @xmath13 .    this is a corollary of several theorems by various authors . we explain in this article why this result is related to the search for a quantum theory of general relativity .    since in @xmath14",
    ", smooth manifolds up to diffeomorphism are in general no longer characterized by their underlying topological manifolds up to homeomorphism , general relativity is no longer related to a @xmath9-qft .",
    "there is , however , another classification result that is still applicable in any @xmath1 : smooth manifolds up to diffeomorphism are characterized by their whitehead triangulations up to equivalence ( pl - isomorphism ) .",
    "we explain these concepts in greater detail below .",
    "they provide us with a very special type of triangulations that can be used in order to discretize smooth , it is _ smooth _ rather than _ topological _ manifolds that correspond to triangulations in this way . ] manifolds in a way which is not merely an approximation nor introduces a physical cut - off , but which rather captures the full information about the equivalence class of differentiable structures .",
    "this suggests that the path integral of general relativity in @xmath15 admits a discrete formulation on such triangulations .",
    "general relativity in @xmath1 is therefore related to what we call a pl - qft ,  a tqft based of piecewise - linear manifolds . in particular , a path integral quantization of general relativity in @xmath1 is related to the construction of invariants of piecewise - linear manifolds . from the classification results",
    ", we will see that this is most interesting and in fact an unsolved problem in topology , precisely if @xmath0 .",
    "it is the decision to take the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry seriously which singles out @xmath0 this way .",
    "the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical observables then implies in the language of the triangulations that all physical quantities computed from the path integral , are independent of which triangulation is chosen .",
    "the discrete formulation on some particular triangulation therefore amounts to a complete fixing of the gauge freedom under space - time diffeomorphisms .",
    "the relevant triangulations can furthermore be characterized by abstract combinatorial data , and the condition of equivalence of triangulations can be stated as a local criterion , in terms of so - called _",
    "pachner moves_. ` local ' here means that only a few neighbouring simplices of the triangulation are involved in each step .",
    "a comparison of pachner moves with the block - spin or coarse graining renormalization group transformations in wilson s language reveals what renormalization means for theories with dynamical geometry for which there exists no _ a priori _ background geometry with which we could compare the dynamical scale of the theory .",
    "we will finally see that the absence of propagating solutions to the classical field equations , for example in pure general relativity in @xmath2 , is related    _ neither _ to the question of whether the path integral corresponds to a @xmath9-qft ( as opposed to a @xmath8-qft ) ,    _ nor _ to the question of whether the vector spaces of this @xmath9-qft or @xmath8-qft are finite - dimensional ,    _ nor _ to the question of whether the theory admits a triangulation independent discretization .",
    "the present article is structured as follows . in section  [ sect_classical ] , we review the classical theory and its gauge symmetry .",
    "the formal properties of path integrals and their connection with @xmath8-qfts and manifold invariants are summarized in section  [ sect_pathint ] . in section  [ sect_manifolds ]",

    "this section contains merely review material : subsection  [ sect_manifold ] on smooth manifolds , subsection  [ sect_firstorder ] on the first order formulation of general relativity , subsection  [ sect_gauge ] on its gauge symmetries , subsection  [ sect_difftop ] on the role of differential topology in the study of general relativity , and subsection  [ sect_diffeo ] on space - time diffeomorphisms .",
    "each of these subsections can be safely skipped .",
    "we nevertheless include the material here in order to fix the terminology , in particular in order to resolve the various misunderstandings that can arise in the discussion of diffeomorphisms in general relativity , just because there seems to exist no standardized terminology in the literature .",

    "<S> the gauge symmetry of classical general relativity under space - time diffeomorphisms implies that any path integral quantization which can be interpreted as a sum over space - time geometries , gives rise to a formal invariant of smooth manifolds . </S>",

    "<S> it turns out that differential topology distinguishes the space - time dimension @xmath0 from any other lower or higher dimension and relates the sought - after path integral quantization of general relativity in @xmath0 with an open problem in topology , namely to construct non - trivial invariants of smooth manifolds using their piecewise - linear structure . in any dimension @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the classification results provide us with triangulations of space - time which are not merely approximations nor introduce any physical cut - off , but which rather capture the full information about smooth manifolds up to diffeomorphism . </S>",
    "<S> conditions on refinements of these triangulations reveal what replaces block - spin renormalization group transformations in theories with dynamical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the classification results finally suggest that it is space - time dimension rather than absence of gravitons that renders pure gravity in @xmath2 a ` topological ' theory . </S>"
