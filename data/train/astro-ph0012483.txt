    "the inherent difficulty in understanding the acceleration of cosmic - rays ( crs ) may not immediately be obvious . at the most basic level we must presumably identify an electric field capable of producing particles of very high energy .",
    "that sounds straightforward in fast moving plasmas . for galactic and especially for ultra - high energy crs ,",
    "the energies involved are so large that the possibilities are very limited .",
    "when we consider , in addition , the energy distribution of the crs , as well as their composition , rate of production and other details , however , the task of modeling their production and propagation becomes very sophisticated . in this talk",
    "i will deal mostly with a few of the more common and basic issues as they apply to baryonic galactic crs below the `` knee '' , which we can conveniently take to be @xmath0gev / nucleus .",
    "several speakers at this meeting have admirably addressed many of the special issues relevant to other aspects of the broader problem .",
    "there is now broad consensus that galactic crs are accelerated mostly from the interstellar medium ( ism ) at supernova remnant blast waves by the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) process . beyond that simple statement , however , significant differences of opinion quickly surface on almost every detail . despite decades of concerted and highly productive effort ,",
    "this is not yet a solved problem , either physically nor astrophysically .",
    "i will now briefly outline some of the arguments pointing us to the consensus viewpoint for the basic scenario , then follow with a brief outline of a few of the issues that continue to hinder our efforts to solve the problem fully .",
    "while these complicating issues seem to be major barriers to a comprehensive understanding , there are hints that when all the pieces of dsa theory are in place together , a robust and possibly simple product may result . for additional dsa insights i direct readers to the accompanying discussion by kang ( 2001 ) , which focuses on empirical evidence for dsa as well as some of important numerical and technical issues and how they are being addressed .",
    "ultimately , cr acceleration comes through an electric field ; however , the most convenient descriptions may not show this explicitly for a given process .",
    "the electric fields are most likely inductive , through large scale motions , although they may be directly applied through stimulated plasma waves . in any case",
    "we can express their effective magnitude as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the relevant speed in the accelerator and @xmath3 is the strength of the local magnetic field .",
    "for an accelerator of length scale , @xmath4 , we can use this to constrain the necessary magnetic field as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the required particle energy in units of @xmath7gev and @xmath8 is the charge on the particle .",
    "this simple constraint can also be derived through a number of different conceptual approaches with modest variations in the numerical constant and some variation in the interpretation of @xmath2 .",
    "examples include using equation [ 5 ] for the time needed for dsa to produce the required energies , constraining the diffusive length scale of a particle to be smaller than the size of the accelerator , or even just requiring the particle gyroradius to be smaller than the size of the accelerator .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the result of equation 1 for @xmath9 and two values of @xmath2 in a form made popular by hillas ( 1984 ) . in the figure",
    "i have indicated rough conventional model properties for a small sample of astrophysical objects .",
    "the only galactic objects known that may be able to satisfy the constraint are supernova remnant shocks ( `` snrs '' ) , winds from o and b stars , pulsar magnetospheres and possibly compact accreting binaries .",
    "pulsars can be excluded as the principal source of galactic crs by considering cr composition .",
    "as described in detail by other speakers at this workshop , the crs below the `` knee '' roughly mirror the composition of the sun and the ism ( e.g. , seo 2001 ; wiebel - sooth , biermann & meyer 1998 ) .",
    "there are important differences , including at the isotopic level , that provide vital clues about the details of the source plasma and cr propagation history ( e.g. , meyer , drury & ellison 1997 ) .",
    "but , to lowest order this information tells us that the source material is almost surely the ism , with perhaps some small admixture of locally processed stellar material .",
    "beginning from that point most models of galactic cr acceleration have focused on snrs based on the total energy input required .",
    "that can be estimated by considering the rate at which cr accelerators must replace crs that diffuse from the galaxy .",
    "isotopic ratios fix the characteristic escape time near 100 mev to be @xmath10yrs ( connell 1998 ) . taking the observed local flux at the solar system and assuming this is also the average for the galaxy this leads to an average required cr power input near @xmath11 erg / sec ( e.g. , drury , markiewicz & vlk 1989 ; fields et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if we take for comparison the galactic supernova rate to be @xmath12 , and kinetic energy yield per event to be @xmath13erg , the available power in snrs is rough @xmath14 erg / sec , which is sufficient , but not by a huge factor .",
    "thus , snr - based models must be at least moderately efficient to supply the needed power .",
    "no other known galactic source comes closer than an order of magnitude to this power supply , explaining why most models have involved snrs .",
    "the cr flux energy spectrum below the knee measured at earth is a power - law after correction for solar modulation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy flux , and @xmath17 is the phase space distribution function ( e.g. , seo 2001 ; wiebel - sooth et al .",
    "these scalings are strictly valid only when the crs are relativistic .",
    "in addition , the flux , @xmath16 is very nearly isotropic , consequent to the diffusive propagation of crs through the ism .",
    "propagation models also generally lead to a steepening of the spectrum with respect to its form at the source , by an increment @xmath18 in the slope ( e.g. , duvernois , simpson & thayer 1996 ) , reflecting an energy dependence to the apparent cr escape rate .",
    "thus , cr source models usually aim to explain a power - law distribution function , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the simple steady state test particle dsa theory predicts a power - law @xmath17 with @xmath21 when shocks are strong is one of the primary reasons that model for cr acceleration has attracted so much attention over the past two decades .",
    "i will , in fact , limit my remaining discussion to issues associated with this process .",
    "there are a variety of approaches to understanding the physics underlying dsa , since the microphysics is complex and depends on what one assumes about such details as the structure and orientation of the local magnetic field .",
    "all approaches depend on a small fraction of nonthermal particles becoming trapped by scattering around a shock front , so that they may tap into the energy flow through the shock for extended times , but with a finite probability of escaping in a given time interval .",
    "it is remarkable that all these approaches give virtually the same answer to the first approximation , at least so long as feedback on the plasma flow can be neglected and various pathologies are avoided . for in - depth discussions of the theory",
    "there are a number of fine reviews ( e.g. , berezhko & krymskii 1988 ; blandford & eichler 1986 ; drury 1983 ; jones & ellison 1991 ; malkov & drury 2000 ) . here",
    "i will outline only some basic properties of the theory as it applies to quasi - parallel shocks , since that is one of the simplest situations .",
    "the dsa theory depends on an almost isotropic particle distribution and particle speeds large compared to the bulk flow speed , @xmath22 .",
    "spatial gradients limited by the assumption of diffusive propagation with respect to local scattering centers lead to a transport equation of the diffusion - convection type ( e.g. , parker 1965 ; skilling 1975a ) , @xmath23 where the first term on the right accounts for adiabatic compression , the second spatial diffusion and @xmath24 is a generic source term that can represent injection or escape , for example .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the scattering length , and @xmath27 is the particle speed .",
    "the flow velocity is u. in this context the scattering is commonly assumed to involve resonant alfvn waves , whence one can estimate from quasi - linear theory ( e.g. , skilling 1975b ) a scattering length @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the particle gyroradius and @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the total magnetic pressure and @xmath32 is the pressure ( energy density ) in waves satisfying resonance , which can be `` sharpened '' to be expressed as @xmath33 , or @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the nonrelativistic cyclotron frequency for the particle species under discussion . the limiting value , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) leads to so - called bohm diffusion . for an oblique magnetic field at a plane shock",
    "this same formalism applies with the substitutions @xmath38 , then @xmath39 with @xmath40 the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal and @xmath41 ( e.g. , jokipii 1987 ) . then @xmath42 refers to diffusion along the shock normal , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 describe diffusion along and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field .    for a parallel shock ( @xmath45 ) we can imagine the acceleration as a first order fermi process , with particles successively being scattered across the shock from opposite sides of a converging flow .",
    "the mean fractional momentum gain between successive downstream returns is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the velocity change across the shock .",
    "the probability of downstream escape by advection following each downstream return is simply @xmath48 . since the average distance a particle diffuses on either side of the shock before being returned is @xmath49 , the mean time between crossings is @xmath50 . using this one can estimate the mean time for a particle to be accelerated from @xmath51 to @xmath52 as ( e.g. , lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) @xmath53 \\frac{dp}{p}\\\\ \\rightarrow ( { \\rm factor})\\times \\frac{x_{d_1}(p_2)}{u_1}=({\\rm factor})\\times t_d(p_2),\\ ] ] where the arrow represents a trend to the bohm limit , and the `` factor '' is 20 for a limiting strong gas shock , if @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . requiring @xmath56 , we recover relation [ 1 ] multiplied by a factor @xmath57 , with @xmath58 in the bohm limit . note that @xmath59 , called the diffusion time for the crs , is the time scale over which an isotropic population of crs will be advected across the diffusive `` precursor '' formed ahead of a shock",
    "this is also the average time for crs to diffuse a length @xmath60 .    for a plane gas shock",
    "the steady solution to equation [ 3 ] is a power - law with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the compression ratio of the shock , @xmath63 is the shock mach number , and the arrow corresponds to a @xmath64 gas .",
    "then @xmath65 in the strong shock limit .",
    "a simple computation shows that @xmath66 , so kinematically the spectrum reflects the match between the rate of particle acceleration and escape .",
    "this solution neglects any backreaction of crs on the shock structure , so constitutes a `` test particle '' solution to the problem .    that simple , limiting solution , apparently independent of any microphysical details , and naturally leading very close to the expected source slope for galactic crs was one of the key insights that raised the community s consciousness about dsa in the late 1970s ( axford , leer & skadron 1977 ; krymskii 1977 ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "the other was a realization that the alfvn waves needed to isotropize the crs would be generated by the crs themselves as they streamed into the oncoming upstream plasma .",
    "the postshock plasma is expected to be turbulent ( e.g. , quest 1988 ) , including waves advected from upstream , so scattering in that region seemed assured , as well .",
    "quasilinear theory provides an estimate of the growth time for resonant alfvn waves ahead of the shock , which depends on @xmath67 . using the fact that the crs will diffuse upstream a characteristic length , @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 , we can estimate this time to be @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the pressure in resonant crs",
    ", @xmath72 is the upstream alfvn speed , and @xmath73 is the alfvnic mach number of the shock .",
    "thus , on the surface , this time scales with the acceleration time , @xmath74 , although the additional factors , which are not all known or even constant , complicate the comparison considerably . in practice calculations have generally assumed @xmath75 is very short , so that @xmath76 reaches an asymptotic limit ( commonly given as bohm diffusion ) , or that wave dissipation and growth are in a local equilibrium that produces another preferred diffusion coefficient ( e.g. , jones 1993 ) . in fact , except for some hybrid plasma simulations involving a limited range of particle energies ( e.g. , quest 1988 ; ellison , et al .",
    "1993 ) this is not a solved problem .",
    "the real beauty of dsa was its apparent simplicity and the robust character of the solution .",
    "however , virtually as it was introduced , dsa theory exposed some potentially very messy details that make the simple behaviors outlined above not obviously valid in many applications .",
    "one i will mention but not elaborate here is the influence of an oblique magnetic field at the shock .",
    "then the magnetic field component aligned with the shock face jumps at the shock , and that means there is necessarily an electric field also aligned with the shock face , but orthogonal to the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to `` shock drift acceleration '' and additional possible complications if the particle propagation is not diffusive across field lines ( e.g. , gieseler et al .",
    "jokipii ( 1982 ) showed , however , that so long as the particles diffuse across field lines and the shock is planar , then the basic formalism already outlined remains intact even for @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 , however , the length and time scales for highly oblique shocks can be reduced from bohm diffusion values ( jokipii 1987 ) .",
    "another complication can result if the magnetic field itself `` wanders '' or is `` braided '' ( kirk , duffy & gallant 1996 ) , since particle motions along the field lines can lead to additional spatial transport that influences the rates of acceleration and escape . while some shocks may well be almost perpendicular , with @xmath77 , it seems to me if the magnetic field is moderately turbulent , that global perpendicular shock behaviors are not likely to be prevalent for nonrelativistic shocks .",
    "many of the other complications can be summarized by noting that dsa is an integral part of collisionless shock formation itself ( eichler 1979 ) .",
    "the particles we call crs are really just a nonthermal tail of the full distribution , @xmath17 .",
    "they are distinguished by their relatively long scattering lengths , and , of course , the relatively large individual particle energies , reflecting the absence of full thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the cr particles come from , or `` are injected '' from , the more abundant bulk plasma population .",
    "they also exert a pressure through their interactions with alfvn waves that can modify the flow of the bulk plasma .",
    "the strength of those waves depends , in turn , on the intensity of the cr streaming , as already pointed out , and on comparative wave growth and dissipation rates .",
    "wave dissipation heats the plasma as well .",
    "flow modifications from a classical gas shock structure resulting from these features alter the various terms in the diffusion - convection equation [ 3 ] , so a test particle solution based on an unmodified shock flow must be reexamined in light of a more integrated view of the physics .",
    "the possible importance of cr backreaction was quickly recognized from estimates of the likely cr pressures ( axford et al . 1977",
    "; eichler 1979 ) . that can be expressed as @xmath79 for @xmath19",
    "this diverges logarithmically as @xmath65 for strong shocks and as @xmath80 .",
    "clearly a real shock must at least include a cutoff at finite @xmath52 .",
    "such a cutoff appears naturally from equation [ 5 ] in a shock of finite age , or as a result of escape by crs above some momentum the latter effect may result either as a consequence of finite shock extent , or from limitations to the intensities of alfvn waves resonant with the highest momentum particles .",
    "i will revisit this last point later on .",
    "using equation [ 7 ] we can crudely compare @xmath81 at the shock for a given cr number density to the thermal pressure , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 represents the ( nonrelativistic ) momentum of a thermal ion .",
    "taking @xmath84 to illustrate , and assuming for simplicity that the crs are all relativistic , we have @xmath85 since all the terms on the right are large except for the fraction of ions in the cr populations , @xmath86 , it becomes immediately obvious when @xmath87 that a relatively very small cr population can easily produce a pressure comparable to the thermal gas .",
    "the consequences of backreaction to the shock properties are significant .",
    "first , the gradient from a finite @xmath81 slows and compresses plasma adiabatically before it reaches the classical and discontinuous gas `` subshock '' .",
    "this effect can be simply estimated by recalling that the crs are distributed upstream in a precursor of characteristic length @xmath68 , producing a pressure gradient that decelerates the flow as it approaches the shock by an amount @xmath88 as @xmath81 at the shock becomes comparable to the dynamical momentum flux into the shock , @xmath89 , we expect the subshock to become very much weakened , since @xmath90 , and adiabatic heating in the shock precursor will reduce the mach number of the flow entering the subshock .    the first and simplest approach to evaluating in detail the dynamics of modified cr shocks used the energy moment of the diffusion - convection equation ( drury & vlk 1981 ; axford , leer & mckenzie 1982 ) .",
    "defining @xmath91 and the closure relation , @xmath92 , we have from equation [ 3 ] @xmath93 provided the limits @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be neglected .",
    "the term @xmath94 is a mean diffusion coefficient weighted by momentum and @xmath17 , and @xmath95 is an integral form of the source term , @xmath24 , in equation [ 3 ] . in equation",
    "[ 11 ] i have expressed @xmath96 in units of @xmath97 . when merged with euler s equations for gas dynamics",
    ", this approach is commonly termed a `` two - fluid '' dynamical model , since the crs are treated as a massless , diffusive fluid coupled to the bulk flow .",
    "backreaction on the bulk plasma is included through the pressure gradient terms in the bulk flow momentum and energy equations .",
    "the pondermotive force of the alfvn waves , as well as their energy dissipation may also be readily included ( achterberg 1982 ; mckenzie & vlk 1982 ) .",
    "the two - fluid approach is somewhat controversial , mostly because the closure parameters , @xmath98 and @xmath94 are not known a priori , and because of some pathological steady state solutions for strong shocks in the limit @xmath99 .",
    "nonetheless , when properly used , it is an effective and computationally efficient method to establish basic features of modified cr shocks ( kang & jones 1995 ) .",
    "the first two - fluid computations showed that it was possible for most of the momentum flux through a shock to be converted into cr pressure , for example , with @xmath81 amplified over the precursor length , @xmath68 .",
    "as many as three steady solutions were identified for strong shocks from given upstream conditions or particle injection rates , when @xmath100 ( drury & vlk 1981 ) .",
    "the solutions differ substantially in the `` efficiency '' of conversion by the shock of momentum influx , @xmath101 , into @xmath81 , and represent a bifurcation phenomenon with respect to the supply of seed particles .",
    "the pathological steady state solutions involved finite postshock @xmath81 from zero upstream @xmath81 , and completely smoothed shocks , in which the gas subshock disappears .",
    "those solutions are the result of assuming @xmath80 and can not be reached practically from time dependent solutions , or when @xmath52 is finite .",
    "nonetheless , as i will outline below from other considerations , the discovery from two - fluid models is correct that shocks may either be highly efficient or not very efficient in accelerating crs in ways that depend sensitively on the supply of seed crs .",
    "two - fluid calculations also confirmed that the basic evolutionary timescale for shock modification is @xmath102 ( drury & falle 1986 ) , and identified the existence of dynamical instabilities derived from the long scaled coupling between the bulk plasma and the crs ( drury & falle 1986 ; zank , axford & mckenzie 1990 ; ryu , kang & jones 1993 ) .",
    "according to the rightmost expression of equation [ 6 ] the cr spectrum should steepen when a pressure precursor forms at the shock , so that the mach number of the subshock is reduced by adiabatic heating and deceleration of the inflow . that is a somewhat misleading observation , however , since the total compression across the structure , including",
    "the precursor , is greater than for the gas shock alone .",
    "thus , according to the other expressions for @xmath103 in equation [ 6 ] particles scattered across the full shock transition , where @xmath104 for an initially strong shock , would be expected to form into a very hard spectrum with @xmath105 .",
    "the relevant interaction length for the crs is , @xmath68 , of course .",
    "for bohm - like diffusion , with @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 , so particles at relatively low momenta respond mostly to the jump across the gas subshock , while the highest momenta particles will reach well past the diffusion lengths of those lower momentum particles . from relations [ 9 ] and [ 10 ]",
    "it is clear that modest momentum crs may produce significant compression in front of the subshock .",
    "that property tends to produce concavity in the form of @xmath17 , and that , in turn enhances the relative importance to @xmath81 of the highest momentum particles over the expression [ 9 ] ; that is , the divergence of the pressure is faster than logarithmic with @xmath52 . thus , the hydrodynamical form of the shock and the form of the cr distribution , @xmath17 , are linked in a highly nonlinear manner .",
    "this point is crucial to our understanding of dsa in practice , as pointed out by a number of authors ( e.g. , ellison & eichler 1984 ; malkov 1999 ) .",
    "the development of these nonlinear features in such a modified cr shock is clearly visible in the evolution of the fully nonlinear diffusion - convection - equation - based simulation presented in ( kang 2001 ; kang et al .",
    "2001 ) , for example .",
    "it is not yet entirely clear what a strongly modified cr shock will look like when it is examined in a complete and fully self - consistent way , nor what the cr spectrum is , despite a considerable effort put into determining those issues .",
    "i will return at the end to some recent insights into those questions . before that it is useful to complete our discussion of issues with a few comments on two more critical aspects of the problem ; namely , the injection of crs out of the bulk plasma , and feedback between the cr acceleration and the evolution of the alfvnic turbulence responsible for moderating the acceleration .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the efficiency of cr acceleration at strong shocks depends sensitively on the rate of injection there ( e.g. , eichler 1979 ; berezhko et al .",
    "1995 ; malkov 1999 ) .",
    "berezhko et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argued for the existence of a critical injection rate , above which the shocks are highly efficient , so that @xmath81 at the shock is a large fraction of the momentum flux into the shock .",
    "below such a threshold the process becomes much less efficient , so the pattern is reminiscent of the original two - fluid results . as part of a study of cr acceleration in snrs berezhko et al .",
    "found a sharp increase in acceleration efficiency in high mach number shocks as the injected proton fraction was increased between @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the number flux through the shocks .",
    "they arbitrarily fixed that number in the models , but the simulations still highlight the issue clearly .",
    "malkov ( 1997a , b ) also argued for an injection threshold on the grounds that once a shock begins to be modified , so that the compression is increased , the highest momentum particles see a larger velocity jump , so are more effectively accelerated , thus enhancing @xmath81 .",
    "that , in turn , enhances the compression at the shock , increasing the acceleration rate , and so on .",
    "the process then becomes limited by the highest momentum to which crs can be accelerated .",
    "it becomes crucial , therefore , to incorporate appropriate injection physics in dsa models .",
    "as noted , crs are an extension of the thermal particle pool reflecting the absence of full equilibrium . at a shock",
    "the majority of ions are `` thermalized '' and unable to re - cross the shock , since the shock thickness is determined by the characteristic thermalization length of the ions .",
    "that process is very complex and incomplete in a collisionless plasma ( kennel , edmiston & hada 1985 ) , however , and some fraction of ions having been only partially thermalized may escape upstream as `` seed particles '' for dsa . the injection problem amounts to determining how that seeding , or `` thermal leakage '' is controlled .",
    "monte carlo simulations handle the process very simply by assigning a form to the scattering law for all the ions that allows a smoothly increasing escape probability with increasing momentum ; i.e. , by setting @xmath110 with @xmath111 ( e.g. , baring , ellison & jones 1994 ) . while that captures the flavor of the process , it does not attempt to include an explicit model for the nonlinear plasma physics associated with the thermalization process .",
    "hybrid plasma simulations do that in detail , of course , but are not really designed to explore the production of very high energy particles that may be accelerated at cosmic shocks .",
    "malkov ( malkov & vlk 1995 ; malkov 1998 ) has recently developed a very promising analytical model for thermalization and associated injection based on the nonlinear trapping of ions in alfvn waves generated by ions escaping upstream and amplified through the shock .",
    "this model is calibrated against hybrid plasma simulations , so contains no free parameters .",
    "they find a very sharp cutoff in the probability to return upstream .",
    "for strong shocks only ions with speeds more than roughly 10 times the bulk flow speed away from the shock have a finite chance to escape back into the oncoming flow and become seed crs .",
    "that is a pretty strong filter , and in nonlinear diffusion - convection simulations we carried out recently based on this model ( gieseler , jones & kang 2001 ) , the injected proton fraction quickly stabilized around @xmath109 . for this model",
    "that result seems fairly robust , with an equilibrium formed between reduced injection coming from cooling of postshock gas as seed particles escape , against decreased upstream compression and a stronger subshock resulting from reduced @xmath81 if injection falls below the equilibrium value .      by",
    "now it should be clear how intricately connected the different elements of the nonlinear dsa model are . once injected the rate at which particles are accelerated in a parallel shock depends on two things ; namely , the velocity profile of the bulk flow and the spectrum and intensity of resonant alfvn waves across the flow profile . as mentioned at the beginning , amplification of the alfvn waves in the precursor is generally attributed to instabilities fed by the crs themselves as they attempt to stream ahead of the shock . while the quasilinear theory of wave amplification is well - established , and was used in deriving equation [ 7 ] , for example , once the wave amplitudes become large , quasi - linear theory is suspect .",
    "similarly , wave dissipation is generally attributed to nonlinear landau damping ( e.g. , vlk , drury & mckenzie 1984 ) , but again that has not been developed to a state that it can be reliably used to give an accurate , fully nonlinear treatment of source terms for the alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the wave dissipation is important in another way , since it leads to local heating of the bulk plasma , adding to the adiabatic heating that already reduces the mach number at the gas subshock",
    ". this heating acts as another limiter in the acceleration process .",
    "malkov , diamond & jones ( 2001 ) have also pointed out an important detail in the transport of alfvnic turbulence in modified shocks that strongly influences the maximum particle momentum , @xmath52 , that , we will recall , becomes the controlling influence in the efficiency of dsa at modified shocks . to see this , consider at a given time that the maximum momentum for the crs is @xmath112 , and then follow those particles as they subsequently return from the downstream flow moving into the upstream flow with increased momenta , @xmath113 , after scattering .",
    "being the first to stream into the flow with these momenta , they do not encounter significant alfvn wave amplitudes at resonant wavelengths ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "thus , they should easily escape the shock and will not be further accelerated .",
    "their streaming will , on the other hand , amplify whatever low level alfvn waves are upstream at the resonant wavelength , and those waves will be advected towards the shock where they can interact with subsequent crs traveling upstream .",
    "however , in a strongly modified shock the flow is compressed as it approaches the gas subshock , causing the in - flowing alfvn wave to be compressed , as well .",
    "( the alfvn speed will generally decrease . ) therefore , these waves will be resonant only with crs of smaller momentum than @xmath115 , and the current population of crs at @xmath116 will not be scattered until they propagate to regions where there has been no compression to the flow .",
    "their rate of return is consequently reduced by the preshock compression , so that there may be a substantial reduction in @xmath112 from the one predicted from bohm diffusion .",
    "the preceding section may leave one with less than full confidence that we will soon be able to model fully nonlinear modified cr shocks in a complete and self - consistent manner .",
    "there are , however , some encouraging developments that could lead us into a much clearer understanding .",
    "for one , computational techniques , as discussed by kang ( 2001 ) , are advancing rapidly and hopefully will soon allow us to include explicitly most or all of the physics outlined here .",
    "second , some recent insights suggest that the full solution for modified shocks may turn out to be robust after all , and that all of the complications work together in a way to find a `` critical '' solution .    for example ,",
    "malkov ( 1999 ) demonstrated recently the existence of a similarity solution for a steady , strongly modified cr shock .",
    "he found a solution to the coupled diffusion - convection and euler s equations in which the flow is highly modified , even allowing the total compression to become arbitrarily large .",
    "those were exactly the kinds of situations where concerns were raised above about the development of non - homologous spectra dependent on many details .",
    "however , despite the highly nonlinear character of malkov s similarity solution , the cr distribution function takes a simple power - law of the form , @xmath117 , independent of the total compression and the form of a given @xmath118 , so long as @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , the flow profile adjusts to the given form of @xmath42 , so that the particle distribution takes this `` universal form '' . in that work malkov",
    "additionally confirmed from the diffusion - convection equation the existence of three distinct solutions analogous to those mentioned earlier , giving very different results for the efficiency of the acceleration and consequent shock modification .",
    "this calculation also established that no solution with a vanishingly small gas subshock can result from the diffusion - convection equation .",
    "malkov identified a critical parameter @xmath120 determining the character of the solution and established for a given mach number , @xmath63 , and cr energy injection efficiency , @xmath121 , that the existence of test - particle and high efficiency solutions depends on the value of @xmath52 .",
    "small values lead to the test - particle solution , while large values formally open up `` intermediate efficiency '' and the `` high efficiency '' solutions .    as an extension of this insight , malkov ,",
    "diamond and vlk ( 2000 ) recently argued that modified cr shocks may evolve towards a _ self - organized critical state _ that finds the combination of critical parameters balancing the energetics of the shock at an appropriate equipartition among the components ; i.e , an `` attractor state . ''",
    "the critical solution for a given mach number depends on the self - adjustment of the particle injection rate and the maximum momentum , @xmath52 .",
    "those in turn are coupled to each other and to the growth , propagation and dissipation of the resonant scattering waves and the underlying bulk plasma that complete the basic physical system .",
    "those authors suggest that the solution would correspond to the shock compression and injection rate that give exactly one solution .",
    "that , in turn depends on the maximum particle momentum , @xmath52 . were @xmath52 to increase above its critical value the total compression would increase , weakening the subshock and reducing the injection rate .",
    "on the other hand if increased escape rates reduced @xmath52 the total compression would be expected to decrease , leading to an increase in the injection rate . both effects would serve to return the system to its critical point .",
    "while these fascinating insights are yet to be confirmed by direct simulations , they do remind us that dsa is one piece of the full physics of collisionless shock formation , and encourages us to look for a unified view of the results .",
    "then perhaps we can anticipate a relatively simple outcome to match the empirical result that crs do seem to appear widely with power - law spectra , implying , when viewed as a whole , that the details are not so crucial after all . that `` whole '' is currently beyond our understanding , but we are making good strides towards clarifying it .    this work has been supported by nasa through grant nag5 - 5055 and by the university of minnesota supercomputing institute .",
    "i am grateful to my colleagues for stimulating discussions on many of these topics , and especially to hyesung kang and to mischa malkov for novel insights . also , i thank the organizers of this meeting for their hard work and for providing a provocative and illuminating program .",
