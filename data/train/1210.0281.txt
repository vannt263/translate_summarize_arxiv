    "for example , he obtained the maximum amplification factor @xmath246 at @xmath247 . because of the quasi - two dimensional approximation , i.e. @xmath248 , miles in his paper @xcite replaced @xmath249 by @xmath41 , and then in @xcite , the authors continued on to use this replacement .",
    "then their computations with rather large values of @xmath41 gave significant shifts of the parameter @xmath217 .",
