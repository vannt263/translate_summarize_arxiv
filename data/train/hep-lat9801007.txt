    "there are 18 two - loop fermionic diagrams contributing to @xmath100 , as well as two diagrams containing an insertion of the one - loop fermion mass counterterm ; these are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the algebra involving lattice quantities was performed using a symbolic manipulation package in mathematica , developed by us in recent years . for the purposes of the present work ,",
    "this package was extended to include fermions .",
    "a first , relatively brief , part in the evaluation of the diagrams is the contraction .",
    "this is done completely automatically for diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops , once the types of vertices , as well as the `` incidence matrix '' for the diagram are specified .",
    "this step also includes : complete reduction of color structures , dirac matrices and tensor structures ; exploiting permutation symmetry and lattice rotational invariance to keep the size of the expression down to a minimum ; use of trigonometry to arrive at a canonical form .",

    "there are relatively few such terms , and in the pure gluonic case they all have been tabulated  @xcite .",
    "we can use these tables also in diagrams with fermions , applying successive subtractions of the type : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the inverse fermionic propagator : @xmath113 .",
    "this leads to the tabulated expressions plus a series of superficially convergent terms .",
    "the rest of the expression may still contain subdivergences , which can give rise to single logarithms .",
    "these are handled using successive subtractions of the type : @xmath114 the first term on the right hand side then yields factorized one - loop expressions , whose @xmath102-dependence is easily extracted , while the second term is more convergent . finally , all remaining terms , containing no ( sub-)divergences can be evaluated by taylor expansion in @xmath115 .    in our code , judicious choices for the right set of subtractions are applied automatically to each term . while the extraction of divergences is not particularly complicated conceptually , it leads to a great proliferation in the resulting number of terms . as an example ,",
    "diagram 16 by itself leads to @xmath116 _ types _ of expressions ; each type must then be numerically evaluated on its own ( because it contains a different set of subtracted propagators ) and contains typically up to some hundreds of terms .      at this stage ,",
    "all the above types of expressions no longer contain @xmath102 and must be numerically integrated over the internal momenta .",
    "the integration is done in momentum space over finite lattices ; an extrapolation to infinite size is then performed ( see below ) .    for expressions with only gluonic propagators",

    "recently , this method was also used for some study cases involving fermions  @xcite . for the present calculation , involving fermionic and bosonic propagators with multiple subtractions ,",
    "the coordinate space method becomes a bit more complicated ; we may return to it in the future , if the need arises for more precision than presented in the present paper .",
    "fortran code for the numerical evaluation of each type of expression is then created automatically by our programs .",
    "the code is highly optimized : it avoids redundant evaluation of common subexpressions , of symmetric regions in momentum space , of @xmath30-independent subexpressions , etc .",
    "the code can be run for different values of @xmath30 and lattice size @xmath117 .",
    "for the present paper we used @xmath118 ; we present @xmath49 and , for comparison , we also estimated @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "extrapolation to infinite lattice size is of course a source of systematic error . to estimate this error",
    ", our procedure carries out automatically the following steps : first , different extrapolations are performed using a broad spectrum of functional forms of the type : @xmath119 for the @xmath120 such extrapolation , a deviation @xmath121 is calculated using several criteria for quality of fit .",
    "finally , these deviations are used to assign weights @xmath122 to each extrapolation , producing a final value together with the error estimate .",
    "we have checked the validity of these estimates in cases where the exact answer was known ( see also below ) , finding the estimate to be always correct .",
    ": gauge invariance requires @xmath123 we checked this property in three ways : firstly , a formal , ward - identity type derivation was performed , in which vertices with background fields at zero momentum were written in terms of appropriate derivatives of inverse propagators . from this",
    "we find not only eq.([c0i ] ) , but also some additional constraints : @xmath124 the above are true for any value of the fermion mass @xmath33 and wilson parameter @xmath30 .",
    "secondly , all the above identities were checked by algebraic manipulation of the full expression for each of the coefficients .",
    "thirdly , we substituted in each identity the numerical results for the coefficients , finding in all cases zero within the error estimates .    :",
    "the sum of these terms must vanish if lorentz invariance is to be recovered in the continuum limit . only diagrams 9 and 17 give nonvanishing contributions , and we checked in the same ways as above that their sum is zero .            in concluding this section",
    ", we would like to point out that the procedure outlined here applies unchanged to several other interesting cases , including : more complicated actions , matrix elements of different operators .",
    "we hope to address these issues in a future publication ."
