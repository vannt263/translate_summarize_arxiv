    "from the point of view of quantum field theory a nucleon is fully described only if one knows the matrix elements of all possible quark and gluon operators involving the nucleon state .",
    "nevertheless , progress is possible provided one can obtain the matrix element of operators with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "twist - two operators give the leading contribution in appropriate hard processes , are relatively simple , and are more accessible to experimental measurement .",
    "the states between which these operators are sandwiched may be of equal or unequal momenta ; the former situation is familiar from well - investigated processes like deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "the latter has also been investigated over the years @xcite .",
    "however their importance has been understood only recently .",
    "for instance , knowing certain off - forward twist - two matrix elements allows for extraction of the quark and gluon orbital and spin contributions to the nucleon spin @xcite .",
    "the class of parton distributions , known as off - forward ( off - diagonal , non - forward ) parton distributions defined from these off - forward matrix elements has generated considerable contemporary interest @xcite . in simple physical terms , a parton distribution , whether forward or off - forward , arises from removal of the parton from the nucleon by a hard probe and its subsequent return to form the nucleon ground state further along the light - cone , or a similar process",
    ".    the class of twist - two operators which depends on parton helicity change shall be the subject of this paper .",
    "it is now well known @xcite that there is one forward chirally odd twist - two proton structure function , known as @xmath0 , measurable in , for example , the drell - yan process .",
    "it is defined as the light - cone correlation of quark fields weighted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 in a helicity basis , wherein spins are measured along the particle s momentum and @xmath3 is diagonal , @xmath4 and @xmath5 differ by one unit of angular momentum . since chirality and helicity coincide for massless quarks , @xmath6 is a _ chiral - odd _ quantity . to give it a probability interpretation requires using a _ transversity _",
    "basis wherein @xmath7 is diagonal .",
    "this gives @xmath6 the necessary probabilistic interpretation ( for states of equal momenta ) : it is the probability to find a quark polarized along the transverse polarization of the nucleon minus the probability to find the quark polarized in the opposite direction .",
    "there is no gluonic helicity - flip distribution for obvious reason  a transverse gluon flipping its helicity leads to a change of two units of angular momentum and angular momentum conservation forbids this for a spin-@xmath8 hadron . for hadrons with spin",
    "@xmath9 there is no such restriction and some years ago jaffe and manohar @xcite identified a leading twist gluonic structure function @xmath10 which can be measured from a transversely polarized target like the deuteron .",
    "new lorentz structures emerge if one allows for off - forward matrix elements , leading to generalizations of the above mentioned helicity changing structure functions .",
    "recently , collins et al . have suggested measuring the helicity - flip quark distributions in vector meson production @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for these distributions has been derived by belitsky and mller @xcite .",
    "diehl et al .",
    "@xcite have noticed that the distribution in angle between the lepton and hadron planes in deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) contains valuable information about the helicity structure of the nucleon - photon amplitudes .",
    "they point out that photon helicity flip is possible even with a spin-@xmath8 target because gluons in the off - forward scattering can transfer two units of angular momentum .",
    "this , of course , requires the existence of the gluon helicity - flip distributions in the nucleon . indeed , for off - forward matrix elements one does not need a state of spin @xmath9 to accomodate gluon helicity flip .",
    "this paper is intended to present a comprehensive study of leading - twist helicity - flip off - forward distributions in the nucleon .",
    "a systematic counting suggests that there are four such distributions : two related to gluon helicity flip and the other two to quark helicity flip . in each case",
    ", a distribution can be defined depending on whether the nucleon s helicity is flipped or not .",
    "we derive the leading - logarithmic evolution of these distributions , although in the quark case , the result was already obtained by belitsky and mller @xcite . in the forward limit",
    ", the evolution of the quark distributions reduces to that of @xmath11 as calculated by artru and mekhfi @xcite .",
    "the evolution for the gluon distributions reduces to that of @xmath12 , which has not appeared in the literature before .",
    "note that the quark helicity - flip distributions do not mix with any gluon ones , and vice versa .",
    "this is quite significant because , for the first time , we have a parton distribution that can serve as a unique signature of the gluons inside the nucleon : gluonic effects can not be mocked up by any kind of constituent quarks , and they can not be evolved away by recklessly evolving down the momentum scale !    we study measurement of the helicity - flip gluon distributions in general two - photon process .",
    "the photon helicity - flip compton amplitude is calculated in terms of the gluon helicity - flip distributions . in the forward limit ,",
    "we recover the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , our result is more general . in the language of operator product expansion",
    ", we obtain the leading - order coefficient functions of a class of gluon operators with total derivatives . according to @xcite ,",
    "the helicity - flip gluon distributions generate distinct angular distributions in the dvcs cross section .",
    "the presentation of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we enumerate the independent helicity amplitudes for the quark - nucleon and gluon - nucleon sub - processes . subsequently new helicity changing distribution functions are motivated and defined . in section",
    "iii the leading logarithmic evolution of these functions is studied .",
    "section iv contains a calculation of the compton amplitude for photon helicity flip scattering .",
    "this amplitude vanishes at the tree level and requires at least one quark box ( plus permutations ) to be non - zero .",
    "section v presents the dvcs cross section that depends on the gluon helicity - flip distributions .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "we shall , in this section , enumerate the complete set of off - forward quark and gluon distributions at the twist - two level .",
    "helicity - flip ones will emerge through the counting and will be the focus of this paper . as usual ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are two light - like vectors with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the momenta and spins of the initial and final nucleons are , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath19 has both transverse and longitudinal components .",
    "it is convenient to define a special system of coordinates wherein @xmath20 is collinear and in the @xmath21 direction , @xmath22 the initial nucleon and parton have longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .    from dimensional reasoning",
    ", the leading order contribution to a given hard process must involve the minimum number of independent parton fields which , for qcd quantized on the light cone , is two ( @xmath25 for fermions and @xmath26 for gluons ) .",
    "therefore , one need consider only the matrix elements of bilinear operators at two different points on the light - cone . in the kinematic region @xmath27",
    ", one has the simple interpretation that the first operator extracts a certain type of parton from the nucleon and the second replaces it further along the light - cone .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the respective helicities of the initial and final nucleon and @xmath29 the helicities of the parton extracted and replaced .",
    "the helicity amplitude @xmath30 must obey @xmath31 ( time - reversal invariance ) , and @xmath32 ( parity invariance ) .",
    "for a purely collinear process there is no preferred transverse direction ; rotational invariance around the collinear axis requires helicity to be conserved , @xmath33 .",
    "however , non - zero transverse momentum of the scattered nucleon or parton means that , while the total angular momentum will of course be conserved , helicity conservation will not necessarily hold .",
    "the difference is , of course , absorbed by the orbital motion of the scattered pair .",
    "for quarks it is readily seen that a set of independent amplitudes is provided by the following : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . the familiar distributions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath0 are linear combinations of the first three in the forward limit @xcite .",

    "the dependence of each distribution upon @xmath45 and @xmath46 is implicit . in each equation",
    ", the first term represents an amplitude that survives the forward limit and the second term an amplitude that decouples ( but does not vanish ) in the forward limit .",
    "the definitions of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are from ref.@xcite .",
    "the quark helicity - flip distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are new ; and they can be selected from the third equation by taking @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the above definitions complete the identification of all twist - two quark distributions .",
    "a few additional comments about the definition in eq .",
    "( [ quark ] ) are in order .",
    "first , for brevity we have not explicitly shown the gauge link between the quark fields .",
    "this link is always present , except in the light - like gauge @xmath55 .",
    "second , by using time - reversal symmetry , all the distributions are seen to be real .",
    "third , from taking the complex conjugate of the above equations , it follows that all the distributions are even functions of @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we can add a time - ordering between the two fields without changing the content .",
    "this follows from , @xmath57 the second term is just a constant because it is an anticommutator of the independent ( or good ) components of the dirac field separated along the light cone .",
    "obviously , the constant does not contribute to the matrix elements .",
    "more elaborate but essentially equivalent proofs can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the distributions @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 have been introduced before @xcite .",
    "their evolutions and mixing with quark distributions have also been worked out .",
    "they play an important roles in electro - meson production in the small @xmath75 region @xcite .",
    "the helicity - flip distributions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are new .",
    "they can be selected from eq .",
    "( [ gluon ] ) by taking @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the angular momentum conservation requires presence of one unit of angular momentum ( @xmath80 ) when the nucleon helicity is flipped ( @xmath77 ) and two units ( @xmath81 ) when it is not ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "hence both decouple from the matrix elements in the forward limit although the distributions themselves do not vanish .    in a sense ,",
    "the gluon helicity - flip distributions are the ",
    "cleanest \" among the class of gluon distributions since they are forbidden to mix with quark distributions by angular momentum conservation .",
    "this , in fact , was why jaffe and manohar @xcite had proposed using the @xmath82 distribution as a probe of  exotic gluons \" in a spin @xmath83 nucleus .",
    "nuclear binding or pions would not contribute .",
    "however there , unlike here , there is a strong suppression on the magnitude of the distribution due to the small size of the nuclear interaction relative to a typical hadronic mass scale because  exotic gluons \" can only be generated by the nuclear interaction ( for an estimate of @xmath82 see ref.(@xcite ) ) . in the nucleon",
    ", the off - forward helicity - flip gluon distributions can be as large as other gluon distributions for a reasonable size of @xmath75 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the n=2 moment of the gluon distributions above can be directly expressed in terms of the matrix elements of the colour electric and magnetic fields in the nucleon .",
    "a parton distribution is necessarily defined at a given distance or momentum scale because of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "physically , the scale can be related to the kinematic variables of the particular hard process under consideration . in this section",
    "we study , using momentum space feynman diagrams , the leading - logarithmic evolution of the helicity - flip parton distributions defined in the previous section . while the method is straightforward in principle , there are important subtleties related to the gauge dependence of the calculation and end - point singularities . in principle",
    "any gauge choice is permissible but the light - cone gauge is naturally preferred for several reasons : the fewest number of diagrams need be calculated , path - ordered exponentials are absent , the light - cone dynamics of partons is transparent , and ghosts are absent .",
    "however , there is a price to be paid because the light - cone gluon propagator , when imbedded in a loop , leads to singularities in the end - points of integrals whose interpretation is ambiguous .",
    "this is sufficient reason to do the ( longer ) calculation in a covariant gauge .",
    "therefore , in the following , we shall use the feynman gauge and treat separately the quark and gluon helicity - flip distributions . at leading - logarithmic order ,",
    "any ultraviolet regulator is as good as any other ; so we impose an ultraviolet cut - off on the momentum integrations .      the result in this section has been obtained before in ref .",
    "@xcite . here for completeness we present our calculation in a different form .    from the definitions of the quark distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq.([quark ] ) , it is clear that the two will evolve identically with the leading component of the operator @xmath86 . selecting only the leading twist part , it is therefore convenient to define , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a unit vector in a transverse direction .",
    "the path - ordered integral has been reinstated in the above .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath46 is the cut - off for the momentum components of the fields .",
    "@xmath89 can be diagrammatically represented as in fig.1a .",
    "now imagine a slight increase of @xmath46 to @xmath90 , revealing a deeper level of hadronic substructure .",
    "additional diagrams contributing to @xmath91 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]    feynman - like rules for these diagrams can be derived in a rather straightforward way : the product of bare heisenberg fields in eq.([kdef ] ) can be brought under the time - ordering symbol and a perturbation expansion follows from expanding out the exponential containing the qcd interaction terms @xmath92 as well as expanding the path - ordered exponential .",
    "subsequently a collinear expansion is made : the lines entering or leaving the hadron blob are always collinear , reflecting the fact that the internal relative momenta of partons in the hadron are much less than the momentum of the hard probe .",
    "the transverse momenta of the other lines is bounded by @xmath46 .",
    "the feynman expressions for fig.1c and 1d are , @xmath93}\\int dy   \\int{d^4k\\over ( 2\\pi)^4 }   \\delta ( x - k\\cdot n ) { i\\over ( q - k)\\cdot n + i\\epsilon } id_{\\alpha\\beta}(q - k ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\frac{1}{8}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}(-igt^an^\\alpha ) \\sigma^{\\rho\\lambda}(-igt^a\\gamma^\\beta)is_f(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta ) \\right ] p_{[\\rho } e_{\\lambda]}{\\cal f}(y,\\xi , q^2 ) \\ , \\\\ \\delta { \\cal f}_d(x,\\xi , q^2 ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}n_{[\\mu}e_{\\nu ] } \\int dy \\int { d^4k\\over ( 2\\pi)^4 } \\delta ( x - y ) { i\\over ( k - q)\\cdot n + i\\epsilon } id_{\\alpha\\beta}(q - k ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\frac{1}{8}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}(-igt^an^\\alpha ) \\sigma^{\\rho\\lambda}(-igt^a\\gamma^\\beta)is_f(k+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta ) \\right ] p_{[\\rho } e_{\\lambda]}{\\cal f}(y,\\xi , q^2 ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the first of the above two equations , @xmath94 and in the second , @xmath95 .",

    "the helicity - flip nucleon amplitude @xmath219 clearly is just the helicity - flip compton amplitude , @xmath220 this can readily be evaluated using eq.([long ] ) by substituting in the appropriate dirac spinor for the nucleon helicity states . according to @xcite ,",
    "certain angular weighted cross sections can be used to make a direct extraction of the above amplitude .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a number of new results related to the helicity - flip off - forward parton distributions .",
    "first , we enumerated systematically all leading - twist off - forward parton distributions for a nucleon : six for the quark parton and another six for the gluon .",
    "four of these distributions , two each for the quark and gluon partons , involve parton helicity - flip .",
    "second , we derived the leading - logarithmic evolution equations for these helicity - flip disitributions . in the forward limit , our result agrees with the known kernel for @xmath11 while the kernel for @xmath12 is new .",
    "third , we obtained the photon helicity - flip compton amplitude in terms of a tower of gluon operators with total derivatives .",
    "our result may be obtained from the known forward case by using the conformal symmetry of qcd .",
    "finally , we compute the leading dvcs cross section which depends on the gluon helicity - flip distributions .",
    "we have emphasized the unique role played by helicity - flip distributions in characterizing the properties of the nucleon .",
    "if one askes for a clear experimental signal of existence of gluons in the nucleon , the helicity - flip compton amplitude would serve the purpose . without the vector gluons",
    ", it would be at least power suppressed in the high - energy limit .",
    "of course , the helicity - flip gluon distributions can also be measured in vector meson production @xcite .",
    "the size of the helicity - flip distributions should be similar to the usual helicity - dependent parton distributions ",
    "there is no extra suppression in the soft physics to curb helicity flip .",
