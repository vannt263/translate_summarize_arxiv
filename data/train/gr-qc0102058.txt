    "in the study of self - gravitating systems there are three factors whose relevance has been recurrently and separately stressed in the literature .",
    "these are , the weyl tensor , the local anisotropy of pressure and the inhomogeneity of energy density distribution ( density contrast ) .    the weyl tensor @xcite or some functions of it @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed to provide a gravitational arrow of time . the rationale behind this idea being that tidal forces tend to make the gravitating fluid more inhomogeneous as the evolution proceeds , thereby indicating the sense of time . however , some works have thrown doubts on this proposal @xcite .",
    "also , as it will be seen below , it is worth noticing that the relation between the weyl tensor and the density contrast is affected by the presence of local anisotropy of pressure .",
    "the role of density inhomogeneities in the collapse of dust @xcite and in particular in the formation of naked singularities @xcite , has been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "finally , the assumption of local anisotropy of pressure , has been proved to be very useful in the study of relativistic compact objects ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a hint pointing to the relevance of the above mentioned three factors in the fate of spherical collapse is also provided by the expression of the active gravitational mass in terms of those factors @xcite",
    ", @xcite .",
    "these three factors are usually considered separately , their relationship being omitted from discussion , even though they are related by a simple expression , which we shall present below @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold . on one hand we shall integrate the vanishing weyl tensor condition , which will allow us to construct conformally flat models ( with anisotropic pressure ) .",
    "the obtained solutions represent static or slowly evolving ( in the quasi - static approximation ) spheres , which could serve for the modelling of compact self - gravitating objects .",
    "on the other hand , we want to study , comparatively , the effects of the above mentioned parameters on the ( slow ) evolution of relativistic spheres . for doing this",
    "we shall contrast the evolution of the conformally flat models with the evolution of models with the same energy density or radial pressure distribution , but non - vanishing weyl tensor . with this purpose",
    "it will be useful to calculate the active gravitational mass and the fluid velocity for each model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section all relevant equations and conventions are given .",
    "the condition for the vanishing of the weyl tensor is integrated in section 3 and the models are described in section 4 .",
    "finally a discussion of results is presented in the last section .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric distribution of collapsing fluid , which we assume to be locally anisotropic and bounded by a spherical surface @xmath0 . the line element is given in schwarzschild - like coordinates by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the coordinates are : @xmath6 .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) has to satisfy einstein field equations @xmath7 which in our case read @xcite : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where dots and primes stand for partial differentiation with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .    in order to give physical significance to the @xmath12 components we apply the bondi approach @xcite , i.e we introduce local minkowski",
    "coordinates ( @xmath13 ) , defined by @xmath14 then , denoting the minkowski components of the energy tensor by a bar , we have @xmath15 next we suppose that , when viewed by an observer moving relative to these coordinates with velocity @xmath16 in the radial direction , the physical content of space consists of an anisotropic fluid of energy density @xmath17 , radial pressure @xmath18 and tangential pressure @xmath19 .",
    "thus , when viewed by this moving observer , the covariant energy - momentum tensor in minkowski coordinates is    @xmath20 then a lorentz transformation readily shows that @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 note that the velocity in the ( @xmath25 ) system , @xmath26 , is related to @xmath16 by @xmath27    outside of the fluid , the spacetime is schwarzschild , @xmath28 in order to match the two metrics smoothly on the boundary surface @xmath29 , we require continuity of the first and second fundamental forms across that surface . as result of this matching",
    "we obtain the well known result @xmath30_\\sigma = 0 \\label{psig}\\ ] ]    next , the radial component of the conservation law @xmath31 gives @xmath32 which in the static case becomes @xmath33 representing the generalization of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkof equation for anisotropic fluids @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall consider exclusively static or slowly evolving ( quasi - static ) systems . by this",
    "we mean that our sphere either does not change or changes slowly on a time scale that is very long compared to the typical time in which the sphere reacts to a slight perturbation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( this typical time scale is called hydrostatic time scale ) .",
    "thus our system is always very close to or in hydrostatic equilibrium and its evolution may be regarded as a sequence of static models linked by ( [ feq01 ] ) .",
    "this assumption is very sensible because the hydrostatic time scale is very small for almost any phase of the life of the star .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath34 minutes for the sun , @xmath35 seconds for a white dwarf and @xmath36 seconds for a neutron star of one solar mass and @xmath37 km radius .",
    "it is well known that any of the stellar configurations mentioned above , change on a time scale that is very long compared to their respective hydrostatic time scales .",
    "let us now translate this assumption in conditions to @xmath16 and metric functions .",
    "first of all , slow contraction means that the radial velocity @xmath16 as measured by the minkowski observer is always much smaller than the velocity of light ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "therefore we shall neglect terms of the order @xmath39 .",
    "then ( [ t1p ] ) yields @xmath40 \\label{lsps}\\ ] ]    since by assumption , our system is always ( not only at a given time @xmath4 ) in equilibrium ( or very close to ) , ( [ prp ] ) and ( [ lsps ] ) imply then , for an arbitrary slowly evolving configuration @xmath41 and of course , time derivatives of any order of the left hand side of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation must also vanish , for otherwise the system will deviate from equilibrium . this condition implies , in particular , that we must demand @xmath42    finally , from the time derivative of ( [ feq01 ] ) , and using ( [ t01 ] ) , it follows that    @xmath43    which implies that we shall also neglect terms linear in the acceleration . on purely physical considerations , it is obvious that the vanishing of @xmath44 is required to keep the system always in equilibrium .",
    "thus , from now on , we shall always assume @xmath45 implying that the system remains in ( or very close to ) equilibrium .",
    "we can now calculate the components of the weyl tensor . neglecting terms of order @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we find that all non - vanishing components can be expressed through @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath49    next , defining the mass function as usual @xmath50 the following relations may be established ( @xcite,@xcite ) @xmath51 @xmath52 both , ( [ wint ] ) and ( [ mint ] ) are valid in the general ( dynamic ) case . however only in the static or the quasi - static case @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 denote the proper energy density and the radial pressure respectively .",
    "the tolman - whittaker mass @xcite within a sphere of radius @xmath5 inside @xmath0 , is defined as @xcite @xmath55    two alternative expressions , easily obtained from the field equations ( see @xcite for details ) are @xmath56 and @xmath57    the interpretation of @xmath58 as the active gravitational mass follows at once from ( [ mnup ] ) and ( [ prp ] ) .",
    "indeed , the first term on the right side of ( [ prp ] ) ( the `` gravitational force '' term ) is the product of the passive gravitational mass density ( @xmath59 ) and a term proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be obtained if we recall that the gravitational acceleration of a test particle , instantaneously at rest in a static gravitational field , as measured with standard rods and coordinate clocks is given by @xcite @xmath61      for the comparative study of the ( slow ) evolution of different solutions , it will be useful to plot the velocity ( @xmath16 ) profiles for different pieces of material .",
    "a simple expression for @xmath16 , may be obtained as follows : from ( [ feq00 ] ) and ( [ mf ] ) , it results @xmath62 and from ( [ el ] ) @xmath63 then using ( [ feq01 ] ) @xmath64",
    "we shall now proceed to integrate the condition @xmath65 which , using ( [ w ] ) , may be written as @xmath66 introducing new variables @xmath67 equation([pr ] ) is cast into @xmath68}{\\left[u ' - u / r\\right ] } - \\frac{2u}{r^2 \\left[u ' - u / r\\right ] } = 0 \\label{yp}\\ ] ] whose formal solution is @xmath69 \\label{y}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a constant of integration , and @xmath71 \\label{g}\\ ] ] @xmath72 changing back to the original variables , eq.([y ] ) becomes @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "next , ( [ 1 ] ) may be formally integrated , to obtain @xmath75 } \\label{fint}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is a constant of integration ( a function of @xmath4 , in the slowly evolving case ) .",
    "the reader may check that ( [ fint ] ) satisfies ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ w0 ] ) ( or ( [ pr ] ) ) .    in the next section we shall present some models satisfying ( [ 1 ] ) ( or ( [ fint ] ) ) .",
    "a simple counting of equations ( ( [ feq00])([feq01 ] ) ) and unknowns ( @xmath77 ) indicates that we have to provide two additional relations ( in the form of equations of state and/or restrictions on metric variables ) , in order to integrate the system ( ( [ feq00])([feq01 ] ) ) .",
    "if one assumes that the fluid is locally isotropic ( @xmath78 ) then , demanding @xmath79 , we are driven to a unique solution ( the schwarzschild interior solution ) , a fact also obvious from ( [ wint ] ) . however ,",
    "if @xmath80 , then the condition @xmath79 , does not single out a unique model .    in what follows",
    "we shall construct two models with @xmath79 .",
    "one of them characterized by @xmath81 , and for the other we prescribe a given energy density distribution which is similar to the one proposed by gokhroo and mehra @xcite . additionally , we present two other models with @xmath82 .",
    "one is characterized by @xmath81 and @xmath83 ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and the other has the same energy density distribution as one of the conformally flat solutions .",
    "our first model is characterized by @xmath84 and @xmath85    then , from ( [ feq11 ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) , it follows @xmath86 with @xmath87 and where ( [ el ] ) has been used .",
    "next , taking @xmath5-derivative of ( [ nui ] ) , and using @xmath88 easily derived from ( [ feq11 ] ) , we obtain @xmath89 which after integration yields @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant ( a function of @xmath4 in the slowly evolving case ) of integration . solving ( [ ctr ] ) for @xmath92 , one obtains @xmath93^{1/3 } + \\left[2 - \\left(27a + 4\\right)^{1/2}\\right]^{1/3 } \\right\\ } \\label{gfi}\\ ] ] with @xmath94 where subscript @xmath0 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the boundary surface @xmath95 .",

    "the second model we shall consider , is well known .",
    "it is characterized by @xmath108 @xmath109 and is not conformally flat .",
