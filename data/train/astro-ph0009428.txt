    "the energetics of the outermost regions of isolated disks surrounding t tauri and herbig ae stars is dominated by passive reprocessing of central starlight . while many protostellar disks are actively accreting ( see , e.g. , the review by calvet , hartmann , & strom 2000 ) , effects of viscous dissipation on disk spectra manifest themselves most strongly in the immediate vicinities of the central stars , i.e. , in the steepest portions of their gravitational potential wells .",
    "simple scaling laws illustrate the relative importance of external irradiation vs. accretion luminosity .",
    "the local viscous luminosity per unit disk area decreases as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stellocentric distance .",
    "by contrast , the flux of central stellar radiation striking the disk drops more slowly as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angle at which starlight grazes the disk surface .",
    "vertical hydrostatic equilibrium normally ensures that disks flare outward such that @xmath3 is a slowly increasing function of @xmath1 for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the stellar radius ( see , e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "hence , there is always a disk radius outside of which the energy from stellar illumination outweighs that of midplane accretion ; in the extreme case that the central star derives its luminosity wholly from accretion , this transition radius is roughly 1 au .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of young star / disk systems longward of @xmath610@xmath7 should thus closely approximate those of passively heated disks , even when accretion is ongoing .",
    "hydrostatic , radiative equilibrium models of passive t tauri disks are derived by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 , hereafter cg97 ) .",
    "the passive disk divides naturally into two regions : a surface layer that contains dust grains directly exposed to central starlight , and a cooler interior that is encased and diffusively heated by the surface ( calvet et al .",
    "1991 ; malbet & bertout 1991 ; cg97 ; dalessio et al .",
    "cg97 compute seds of passive disks viewed face - on and employ their model to satisfactorily fit the flattish infrared excess and millimeter wavelength emission of the t tauri star gm aur .",

    "they point out that the spectrum of a nearly edge - on disk is that of a class i source for which @xmath8 rises from 2 to @xmath9 ( lada & wilking 1984 ; lada 1987 ) . in general , class i sources are best described by a combination of an inclined , passively heated disk and a dusty bipolar outflow or partially evacuated envelope .",

    "this third paper in our series on passive protostellar disks extends our work in three directions :    1 .",
    "we refine equilibrium , 2-layer models of passive disks by ( a ) accounting for a range of particle sizes , ( b ) employing laboratory - based optical constants of a suite of circumstellar grain materials , and ( c ) solving numerically the equations of radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium within our original 2-layer approximation .",
    "we systematically explore how the sed of a face - on disk depends on grain size distributions , disk geometries and surface densities , and stellar photospheric temperatures .",
    "physical explanations are provided for all observed behaviors of the sed .",
    "we employ our refined face - on models to fit observed seds of 3 herbig ae ( hae ) and 2 t tauri stars .",
    "these observations include new spectra between 43 and @xmath10 from the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) aboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ) ( creech - eakman , chiang , van dishoeck , & blake 2000 ) .",
    "the uniqueness of our fitted values of disk parameters is assessed , and evidence for emission lines from superheated silicates and ices is reviewed .",
    "the input parameters and basic equations governing our refined standard model are detailed in  [ refin ] .",
    "results , including a systematic exploration of how the sed varies in input parameter space , are presented in  [ refinres ] .",

    "we have experimented with including additional grain compositions ( e.g. , graphite , organics , and troilite ) , but in no instance do we find our conclusions changed qualitatively .",
    "our goal is not to be slavishly realistic but rather to highlight chief physical effects .",

    "one consequence of using the constants for crystalline ( 213272 k ) water ice as opposed to amorphous ( @xmath6100 k ) ice is that spectral features due to translational lattice modes at @xmath66 and @xmath67 are slightly underestimated in width and overestimated in amplitude ( see , e.g. , hudgins et al .",

    "deviations from a single power - law behavior for @xmath126 arise from structure in @xmath127 . for example , @xmath121 declines slightly more steeply with @xmath1 for @xmath128 because grains at these distances cool relatively efficiently through silicate resonances at @xmath129@xmath130 .",

    "the result shown here and that of cg97 ( see their figure 6 ) differ primarily in the emission from the superheated surface .",
    "here we have accounted in detail for the optical properties of a few likely circumstellar grain materials .",
    "solid - state resonances of superheated dust grains residing in disk surface layers appear in emission .",

    "emission lines from vibrational resonances in ice shortward of @xmath9 are absent ; ice is not present in the disk surface inside 6 au .",
    "may still appear in disk spectra if silicate particles are hydrated .",

    "the signature of this `` silicate transparent region , '' however , is largely masked by emission from the optically thick interior at small radius .",
    "furthermore , our computational experiments demonstrate that including other types of particles in the surface layer such as troilite ( fes ) serves to further fill in this transparent region .",

    "millimeter - wave fluxes are most sensitive to @xmath16 , @xmath135 , @xmath29 , and @xmath136 .",
    "the former two variables determine the amount of mass in the cool disk interior at large radius ; the latter two variables affect the millimeter - wave opacity in the disk interior .",
    "millimeter - wave seds for @xmath137 and @xmath9 are identical ; these two cases belong to the rayleigh limit , in which absorptive cross - sections are proportional to grain volume ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) . in this limit ,",
    "millimeter - wave opacities are independent of how the total condensable mass in water and silicates is distributed with particle size .",
    "3 .   as @xmath29 increases from 10 to @xmath138 , the opacity at @xmath139@xmath140 in the disk interior also increases , thereby enhancing emission from the disk interior at those wavelengths .",
    "a similar effect is seen as @xmath29 increases from 100 to @xmath141 .",
    "4 .   for all values of @xmath29 considered , the spectral index of the sed at @xmath142@xmath143 mm equals @xmath144 .",
    "the value of @xmath145 equals the value of @xmath146 for our ice - silicate grains , indicating that radiation at these wavelengths emerges from optically thin material .",
    "5 .   for @xmath147 ,",
    "most of the geometric cross - section in our dust size distribution is concentrated in the largest grains ( @xmath148 in the surface and @xmath149 in the interior ) .",
    "compared to the standard model , silicate emission features from the surface at mid - infrared wavelengths are weaker because the rayleigh limit does not apply for these large grains . at millimeter wavelengths , @xmath150 ; a substantial fraction of the mm - wavelength emission arises from the disk interior made optically thick by the increased number of mm - sized particles .",
    "note also the relative dearth of emission from @xmath151@xmath152 compared to the standard model , caused by fewer numbers of @xmath153@xmath154 sized particles in the disk interior and a concomitant loss of interior opacity at these wavelengths .",
    "for @xmath155 , most of the condensable mass is concentrated in the smallest grains ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "millimeter - wave opacities and therefore fluxes are lower than for our standard model .",
    "emission at @xmath157 does not differ from standard model results because the rayleigh limit still applies for the most luminous grains in the surface ; shapes of the emissivity curves for silicate and ice - silicate grains are independent of @xmath47 in the rayleigh limit ( see figure [ qabs ] ) .",
    "the radial locations of condensation boundaries in disk surface layers move outward approximately as @xmath158 . consequently ,",
    "as @xmath14 increases , surface emission from water ice diminishes noticeably .",
    "8 .   reducing the height of the disk photosphere by reducing the scaling parameter @xmath23 ( thereby crudely modelling the effects of vertical settling of dust )",
    "lowers the amount of stellar radiation intercepted and reprocessed by the disk .",
    "emission at @xmath159 scales nearly linearly with @xmath23 .",
    "radiation at these wavelengths arises from the optically thick interior ( region `` i '' ) and from the optically thin surface ; for both regimes , @xmath8 scales as @xmath160 which scales approximately as @xmath23 .",
    "radiation at @xmath161the rayleigh - jeans regime  is less sensitive to @xmath23 ; here the approximate scaling relation reads @xmath162 .",

    "if @xmath165 , the sed is unchanged because those grains having @xmath166 are insufficiently numerous to be significant absorbers of radiation .",
    "if @xmath167 , the surface sed remains unaltered because the rayleigh limit still obtains .",
    "our sample comprises 3 hae and 2 t tauri stars that are ( 1 ) not known to harbor stellar companions , and ( 2 ) not known to drive jets or to be surrounded by massive , @xmath168-scale nebulosities that are better described by spherical envelopes rather than by flattened disks . in order of decreasing stellar effective temperature ,",

    "all of our sources were too weak to be observed by the iso short wavelength spectrometer .",
    "the code that computes our refined standard model is restricted to calculating seds for face - on disks .",
    "a detailed study of how the sed varies with inclination , @xmath170 , has been given previously ( cg99 ) .",
    "as described there , non - zero inclinations affect the infrared sed in 2 principal ways : at moderate @xmath170 , by introducing a cosine @xmath170 variation in emission arising from the optically thick interior , and at extreme @xmath170 , by blocking radiation from the disk at small radius via the intervening flared disk at large radius . the second effect on",
    "the infrared sed is negligible for our sample stars .",
    "visual extinctions range from @xmath171 mag ( mwc 480 ) to 2 mag ( cq tau ) ; these modest values imply that inner disk regions are not significantly occulted by flared outer disk edges at mid - to - far infrared wavelengths .",
    "we estimate that the first effect introduces at most a factor of 2.5 overestimation in our computed fluxes between 2 and @xmath132 where the sed is dominated by emission from the optically thick interior .",
    "for example , the disk inclination for cq tau has been independently estimated to be @xmath666@xmath172 , based on photometric and polarimetric variability at visible wavelengths ( natta & whitney 2000 ) .",
    "such `` uxor - type '' phenomena has been interpreted to arise from clumps of dust in the flared disk surface sporadically obscuring our line - of - sight to the central star .    for each source , a model sed is fitted to the iso lws scan ( if available ) , millimeter wavelength fluxes , and @xmath6325 @xmath173 photometric data . in 3 of the sources ( aa tau , cq tau , and mwc 480 ) , iso fluxes are greater than corresponding iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) fluxes at 60 and @xmath138 by factors of @xmath623 .",
    "the origin of the discrepancies is not known .",
    "where there are discrepancies , preference is given to the iso lws data for which the beam area is @xmath62 times smaller than that of iras .",
    "for hd 36112 , there is excellent agreement between iso and iras .",
    "preference is given also to the central portions of the iso scans between 50 and @xmath174 where individual detectors overlap in wavelength coverage and measured fluxes are consequently more reliable .",
    "in fitting the seds , we fix @xmath163 .",
    "smaller values ( @xmath175 ) seem unlikely since they would imply that the largest grains , which tend to settle out of surface layers most quickly , dominate the geometric cross - section .",
    "the sed is insensitive to larger values ( @xmath176 ) , as shown in ",
    "[ paramexp ] .",

    "the fits are intended to be illustrative ; no attempt is made to minimize fit deviations in a formal , statistical sense .",
    "the results of such an analysis would not be very meaningful anyway , since the sed tends to be degenerate with respect to simultaneous changes in several  of  the  parameters , as we discuss in  [ degenesec ] . in any case , our fitted outer disk truncation radii for cq tau , hd 36112 ( mwc 758 ) , and mwc 480 are in accord with upper limits based on @xmath188 continuum images taken by mannings & sargent ( 1997 ) .    with few exceptions ,",
    "the agreement between models and observations is good to within a factor of 2 , and serves as further evidence that simple reprocessing of central starlight by flared disks adequately explains the infrared excesses of these systems .",
    "we are aware that this is not the conclusion of miroshnichenko et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter mive99 ) , who require the presence of tenuous envelopes having radii @xmath6@xmath189 to heat embedded hae disks to temperatures greater than those predicted by the classical @xmath190 law .",
    "this idea was first elucidated by natta ( 1993 ) in the context of flat spectrum t tauri stars .",
    "while some hae systems do exhibit large scale nebulosities whose sizes as functions of wavelength vary in accord with the calculations of mive99 , we disagree with the statement that disks are incapable of explaining the seds of hae systems without heating from an envelope .",
    "non - classical temperature laws follow naturally from passive reprocessing of starlight by hydrostatically flared disks ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; cg97 ; this paper ) .",
    "moreover , mive99 claim that radiation from disk surface layers as envisioned by cg97 do not contribute substantially to seds of hae stars mwc 480 and cq tau .",
    "however , in figures [ mwc ] and [ cqsed ] , our model fits to these 2 sources indicate that ( 1 ) emission from optically thin disk surface layers dominates emission from the optically thick disk interior between 10 and @xmath6@xmath191 , and ( 2 ) surface layer emission naturally explains the observed infrared excesses , in particular the presence of silicate and ice emission bands ( see  [ isel ] for a more complete discussion of these bands ) .",
    "certainly the sed alone does not furnish sufficient information to uniquely constrain the geometry of dust surrounding hae stars .",
    "we agree with mive99 that the presence of envelopes is an important possibility to consider for all hae stars , and that for sources such as ab aur their existence is persuasively implicated by imaging data at multiple wavelengths ( see  2 of mive99 ) .",
    "we simply wish to emphasize here that the sed alone does not rule out isolated disks heated by their central stars , and that envelopes are not the only way to achieve extra heating of the disk .",
    "as might be gleaned from figures [ parexp1 ] and [ parexp2 ] , the values for @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 , and @xmath21 presented in table [ fitpar1 ] can not be uniquely constrained by the continuum sed alone .",
    "we display one degenerate combination in figure [ degen ] , where 2 models using 2 different sets of parameters are fitted to the observed data for hd 36112 .",
    "we feel that the fits are of comparable quality , given the crudeness of our 2-layer model .",
    "it follows that the total disk mass ( in dust ) is highly uncertain ; in fact , our two models for hd 36112 differ in their total dust mass by a factor of @xmath66 .",
    "one relies on the optical thinness of the disk interior at millimeter wavelengths to measure the disk mass in dust : @xmath192 .",
    "the problem is that the sed alone can not disentangle @xmath93 from @xmath87 , which in turn depends on @xmath25 and @xmath29 .",
    "the two models in figure [ degen ] yield significantly different results for the mass distribution in space , however .",
    "upcoming spatially resolved observations at millimeter wavelengths will help to break this degeneracy between grain size ( i.e. , millimeter - wave opacity ) and disk surface density ( beckwith , henning , & nakagawa 2000 ) .      the one disk parameter which appears to be most uniquely constrained is @xmath23 , the height of the disk photosphere in units of the gas scale height .",
    "its value is roughly proportional to the overall level of infrared excess at @xmath157 .",
    "cq tau exhibits @xmath193 , a value appropriate for gas and dust that are well - mixed in interstellar proportions .",
    "many of our sources , however , are fitted with significantly lower values between 1 and 4 .",
    "we interpret these low values to mean that dust in disk surface layers has settled vertically towards the midplane .",
    "this was expected from the analysis of cg97 ( see their  3.3 ) , and reinforces similar conclusions by dalessio et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "the overall level of infrared excess at @xmath157 can also decrease with increasingly edge - on viewing angles , as the central portions of the disk are increasingly hidden from view by the flared outer `` wall '' ( cg99 ) .",
    "inclination effects appear insufficient to explain the relatively low infrared excesses exhibited by sources here , however , because their visual extinctions are @xmath194 mag and their near - to - mid - ir fluxes are not lower than their far - ir fluxes ; the reverse would be true for significantly inclined sources .",
    "using the results from cg99 , we estimate that infrared excesses may be depressed by a factor of @xmath61.5 for our sources due to non - zero inclination ; the suppression factor due to lower values of @xmath23 is @xmath624 .",
    "observational evidence for silicate emission at @xmath9 from the superheated surface exists for all of our sources except aa tau . in cases",
    "where medium - resolution spectra exist ( mwc 480 , lkca 15 ) , the `` trapezoidal '' shape of the observed emission feature is imperfectly fitted by our model ; this indicates that actual surface layer silicates have allotropic states ( crystalline vs. amorphous ) and compositions ( pyroxene vs. olivine , and fe : mg ratios ) slightly different from the amorphous mgfesio@xmath43 that we employ .",
    "sitko et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reproduce the `` trapezoidal '' shape of the @xmath9 emission feature using an admixture of amorphous olivine , amorphous enstatite ( a pyroxene ) , and crystalline olivine , in roughly equal proportions .",
    "the amplitudes of the observed emission bands indicate that the dominantly absorbing ( emitting ) silicates in the surface layer have sizes @xmath195 , well inside the rayleigh limit .",
    "observational evidence for water ice emission at @xmath6@xmath196 is present in iso scans of 2 of the coolest stars , cq tau and aa tau .",
    "the feature at @xmath196 represents the translational mode in water ice having the highest oscillator strength .",
    "if we examine only the iso data in the magnified inset plots of figures [ mwc ] , [ hdsed ] , [ cqsed ] , and [ aa ] , and ignore the model fits , there appears to be a trend of increasing @xmath6@xmath196 flux relative to @xmath6@xmath197 continuum flux with decreasing stellar effective temperature .",
    "this behavior accords with the trend noted in  [ paramexp ] ( see figure [ parexp2 ] ) , whereby the amount of ice present in disk surface layers decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "notwithstanding this qualitative agreement , the model fits to water ice emission bands ( or lack thereof ) in the iso spectra require substantial improvement .",
    "the best fitted cases include ( 1 ) cq tau , for which there is even observational evidence of an additional translational band at @xmath198@xmath199 which our model reproduces , and ( 2 ) mwc 480 , for which the high stellar temperature and the relatively small outer truncation radius of the disk suppress water ice emission to levels in approximate accord with observations . however , the observed width of the @xmath196 band in cq tau is narrower than what our model predicts .",
    "the discordancy of emission line shapes at @xmath196 is yet stronger in the cases of aa tau and hd 36112 . in the latter case ,",
    "water ice emission is predicted by the model but is not observed .",
    "see , however , figure [ degen ] for an alternative model in which we substantially reduce the outer disk radius of hd 36112 , thereby reducing the @xmath196 flux .",
    "accurate reproduction of observed solid - state emission features from water is hampered by a number of difficulties . aside from the crudeness of our 2-layer radiative transfer scheme ,",
    "these obstacles include ( 1 ) uncertainties in the photospheric abundances of water relative to silicates ( we have assumed cosmic abundances with 50% of the oxygen tied up in water and 100% of the iron locked in refractory grains ) ; ( 2 ) uncertainties in how ice is distributed with particle size ( we have assumed a constant fractional radial thickness of the ice mantle relative to the radius of the silicate core for a power - law distribution of core radii ) ; ( 3 ) the probable presence of impurities in water ice that can shift band positions and widths ; and ( 4 ) incompleteness of laboratory data for the optical constants of a cosmic mixture of ices in various allotropic states at wavelengths longward of @xmath138 . improving the fits by attacking these problems is beyond the scope of our present , exploratory work .    finally , we note the existence of several apparent emission bands in the iso spectra that we are unable to identify .",
    "most prominent among these is a broad peak near @xmath200 in scans of aa tau , mwc 480 , and possibly cq tau and hd 36112 .",
    "no resonance at @xmath200 exists for amorphous silicates ( jger et al .",
    "1994 ) ; nor is such a resonance measured for the crystalline silicates studied by jger et al .",
    "however , these latter authors also show that peak positions of a given vibrational mode shift towards longer wavelengths with increasing iron - to - magnesium content ( higher effective vibrating masses ) .",
    "we propose that the @xmath200 feature is caused by a translational mode in crystalline olivine having an fe : mg ratio intermediate between that of `` natural olivine '' ( mg@xmath201fe@xmath202sio@xmath43 ) and `` natural hortonolite '' ( mg@xmath203fe@xmath204sio@xmath43 ) ( jger et al .",
    "1998 , see their table 3 ) .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect an associated crystalline silicate translational band to appear near @xmath205 ; indeed , such an emission line does appear in iso scans of aa tau , mwc 480 , and hd 36112 . with regards to these and other perceived emission bands in the iso data , however , the possibility of instrumental error must unfortunately be kept in mind ( see  4.2.2 of creech - eakman et al .",
    "2000 ) .      our model near - infrared fluxes shortward of @xmath9 are occasionally underestimated in mwc 480 , lkca 15 , and aa tau . if we adopt the disk inclination of @xmath206 for cq tau ( natta & whitney 2000 ) and the resultant lowering of its model near - ir fluxes by a factor of 2.5 ( see  [ fitherbig ] ) , then this star s observed near - ir fluxes are also inadequately explained .",
    "the relative dearth of surface layer emission arises partly because silicate particles are particularly transparent in this wavelength regime that exists between the vibrational resonances near @xmath9 and absorption due to iron impurities near @xmath96 .",
    "it seems possible that thermally - spiked emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in disk surface layers may help to fill in this transparent region of the sed .",
    "the strongest resonances are due to c - h and c - c stretching and bending modes at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and @xmath207 ( draine 1995 ) . upcoming high spectral resolution observations with sofia ( stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ) can test this hypothesis .",
    "we note , however , that natta , prusti , & krugel ( 1993 ) and bouwman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue against this explanation for hae stars ab aur and hd 163296 based on the need for unrealistically high abundances of pahs and on available iso short wavelength spectrometer data .",
    "other neglected but possibly relevant contributions to near - ir excesses include ( 1 ) active accretion , which is likely to play an important role at disk radii inside a few au , ( 2 ) reflected starlight off the disk surface , and ( 3 ) the possibility of dust components in addition to the disk , e.g. , an optically thin , spherically distributed cloud of silicate / iron grains within a few au of the star ( mive99 ; bouwman et al .",
    "in this work , we have constructed improved versions of 2-layer passive disk models by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 ) .",
    "these improvements include an explicit accounting of grain size distributions and grain compositions , and numerical solution of the equations of radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium under the original 2-layer approximation .",
    "we have explored how the sed varies in input parameter space and applied our models to observations of 5 t tauri and herbig ae stars .",
    "our principal conclusions are as follows :    1",
    ".   hydrostatically flared , passive disks having masses of @xmath60.01@xmath208 and radii of @xmath6100250 au adequately explain the infrared - to - millimeter wavelength excesses of our sample classical t tauri and hae stars .",
    "unambiguous determination of the geometry of circumstellar dust requires , however , spatially resolved images .",
    "maps from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths generated by the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) , and the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) will help to break degeneracies inherent in seds between , e.g. , those of disks and envelopes . 2 .",
    "solid - state spectral features in the mid - infrared ( @xmath209@xmath210 ) appear in emission from face - on disks .",
    "these emission features arise from `` disk atmospheric grains '' : grains in disk surface layers that are directly irradiated by central starlight .",
    "the strongest resonances include the @xmath9 peak from surface silicates at stellocentric distances of a few au , and the @xmath196 peak from surface water ice at distances of @xmath6100 au .",
    "the strengths of these emission bands relative to that of the adjacent continuum depend on ( a ) the sizes of atmospheric grains that absorb the bulk of the stellar radiation , and ( b ) the disk viewing geometry . if atmospheric grain sizes are within the rayleigh limit ( @xmath211 ) , emission band amplitudes saturate relative to the continuum . as atmospheric grain sizes increase beyond the rayleigh limit ( @xmath212 ) , emission band amplitudes decrease .",
    "in addition , as the disk is viewed at increasingly edge - on inclinations , emission bands tend to go into absorption ( cg99 ) .",
    "values for @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 , and @xmath21 influence the sed most at wavelengths longward of @xmath138 .",
    "their values for a given source , however , can not be uniquely constrained by the millimeter - wave sed alone .",
    "one relies on the optical thinness of the disk interior at millimeter wavelengths to measure the disk mass in dust : @xmath192 .",
    "the problem is that the sed alone can not disentangle @xmath93 ( which depends on @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 ) from @xmath87 ( which in turn depends on @xmath25 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "spatially resolved millimeter - wave maps can help to break the degeneracy between interior grain size and disk mass .",
    "the one disk parameter which appears to be most uniquely constrained by the sed is @xmath23 , the height of the disk photosphere in units of the gas scale height .",
    "its value is roughly proportional to the overall level of infrared excess at @xmath157 .",

    "our other sources  mwc 480 , hd 36112 , lkca 15 , and aa tau  are fitted with significantly lower values between 1 and 4 .",
    "we interpret these low values to mean that atmospheric grains in disk surface layers have settled vertically towards the midplane . for standard disk parameters ,",
    "the time required for a 0.1 micron - sized grain to settle from @xmath213 to @xmath214 is @xmath215 in the absence of vertical gas flow ; from @xmath213 to @xmath216 , the required time is @xmath217 ( cg97 ; creech - eakman et al .",
    "both these times are of the same order of magnitude as the estimated stellar ages . the actual amount of photospheric settling depends also on the unknown degree of turbulence and vertical circulation in gas .",
    "translational lattice modes in water ice appear in emission at @xmath196 and possibly also at @xmath67 in cq tau and aa tau , two of the coolest stars in our sample ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "we interpret these emission bands as arising from disk atmospheric silicates mantled by water ice at stellocentric distances of @xmath6100 au . the hottest stars in our sample , mwc 480 and hd 36112 ( @xmath219 ) , evince no such emission bands .",
    "by itself , the dependence on stellar temperature of the location of the ice sublimation boundary in the disk surface layer is insufficiently steep ( approximately @xmath220 ) to account for the presence and absence , respectively , of water ice bands in lws spectra of cq tau and hd 36112 ; these two stars differ in their effective temperatures by only @xmath615% .",

    "<S> new features include ( 1 ) account for a range of particle sizes , ( 2 ) employment of laboratory - based optical constants of representative grain materials , and ( 3 ) numerical solution of the equations of radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium within the original 2-layer ( disk surface + disk interior ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically explore how the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a face - on disk depends on grain size distributions , disk geometries and surface densities , and stellar photospheric temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> observed seds of 3 herbig ae and 2 t tauri stars , including spectra from the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) aboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , are fitted with our models . </S>",
    "<S> silicate emission bands from optically thin , superheated disk surface layers appear in nearly all systems . </S>",
    "<S> water ice emission bands appear in lws spectra of 2 of the coolest stars . </S>",
    "<S> infrared excesses in several sources are consistent with significant vertical settling of photospheric grains . while this work furnishes further evidence that passive reprocessing of starlight by flared disks adequately explains the origin of infrared - to - millimeter wavelength excesses of young stars , we emphasize by explicit calculations how the sed alone does not provide sufficient information to constrain particle sizes and disk masses uniquely . </S>"
