    "it is well known that an atom near a neutral macroscopic body is subject to a force , even if the atom and the body are in the ( unpolarized ) ground states .",
    "the existence of the force commonly called van der waals ( vdw ) force has been experimentally well established . in particular ,",
    "vdw forces on atoms in multilayer systems have been observed via mechanical means in atomic beam transmission @xcite and quantum reflection experiments @xcite , and via spectroscopic means @xcite , inter alia frequency modulated selective reflection spectroscopy @xcite .    as long as the atom - body separation is sufficiently large compared with the atomic radius on the one hand , and the typical distance between the atomic constituents of the body on the other hand",
    ", the vdw force can be calculated within the frame of macroscopic electrodynamics . a unified theory that covers both the nonretarded distance regime  already studied by lennard - jones in 1932 @xcite  and the retarded distance regime was first given in 1948 by casimir and polder @xcite . with this in mind , the force has also been called casimir - polder force .",
    "casimir s and polder s theory is based on exact quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the electromagnetic field being quantized in terms of normal modes .",
    "the coupling energy of a ground - state atom with the body - assisted electromagnetic vacuum field is calculated in lowest order of perturbation theory , and the vdw force emerges as the gradient of this coupling energy  the vdw potential .",
    "this formalism first applied to the case of an atom placed in front of a perfectly conducting plate was later extended to excited atomic energy eigenstates @xcite as well as to an atom between two perfectly conducting plates @xcite .",
    "moreover , the concept has been used to calculate the vdw force acting on an atom placed in front of a semi - infinite dielectric half space @xcite or between two dielectric plates of finite thickness @xcite .",
    "recently , the ideas of casimir and polder have been generalized to allow for dispersing and absorbing bodies @xcite , which inhibit electromagnetic - field quantization via a standard normal - mode expansion in general .    in parallel with the sophistication of casimir s and polder s concept based on exact quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "a semiphenomenological approach to the problem of the vdw force has been established and widely used . according to this approach , the coupling energy is expressed in terms of correlation functions for the atom and/or the electromagnetic field which in turn are related to susceptibilities via the dissipation - fluctuation theorem . the result  which in principle applies to arbitrary geometries  was first applied to a ground - state atom placed in front of a perfectly conducting half space @xcite , a dielectric half space @xcite , and a dielectric two - layer system @xcite .",
    "later , atoms in excited energy eigenstates were included in the concept @xcite .",
    "effects of surface roughness @xcite , finite temperature @xcite and in the case of the semi - infinite half space ",
    "different materials such as birefringent dielectric @xcite and even magnetodielectric matter @xcite have been considered .    apart from the two main routes outlined above , a number of other methods have been suggested and applied to various systems .",
    "the vdw potential of a two - level atom in front of a perfectly conducting half space has been derived upon using nonperturbative spectrum - summation techniques @xcite and classical electrodynamics with random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the problem of the vdw force acting on a ground - state atom in front of a dielectric half space has been treated via microscopic models @xcite , @xmath0-matrix formalism @xcite , and source theory @xcite .",
    "electrostatic methods applicable to the nonretarded distance regime have been used to determine the vdw force acting on an excited - state atom in front of a semi - infinite half space filled by a birefringent dielectric @xcite , and the problem of the vdw force acting on an atom in front of a nondispersive dielectric three - layer system has been studied @xcite . within the frame of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics , a dynamical approach to the vdw force has recently been developed in order to study time - dependent forces in the case of atoms initially prepared in an arbitrary excited quantum state @xcite .    in the large body of work on vdw forces and related electromagnetic forces ( such as the vdw force between two atoms or the casimir force between two macroscopic bodies ) the electric properties of the involved material objects",
    "have typically been the focus of interest .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction of objects possessing also noticeable magnetic properties  a problem which has regained topicality due to the recent fabrication of metamaterials with controllable electromagnetic properties in the microwave regime @xcite  has been of interest . the fact that maxwell s equations in the absence of ( free ) charges and currents are invariant under a duality transformation between electric and magnetic fields",
    "can be exploited to extend the notion of forces acting on electrically polarizable objects to objects with magnetic properties .",
    "thus , knowing the attractive vdw force between two electrically polarizable particles ( e.g. , atoms ) , one can infer the existence of an analogeous attractive force between two magnetically polarizable particles , which may be obtained from the former by replacing the electric polarizabilities by the corresponding magnetic ones .",
    "in contrast , the force between two polarizable particles of opposed type is repulsive @xcite . while the repulsive vdw potential in the retarded limit obeys the same @xmath1 power law ( @xmath2 , distance between the particles ) as the attractive vdw potential ( in the case of two particles of the same type ) , but is smaller in magnitude than the latter by a factor of @xmath3 @xcite , the leading contribution to the repulsive vdw potential in the nonretarded limit is proportional to @xmath4 , which contrasts with the @xmath5-dependence of the attractive vdw potential .",
    "this difference can be understood by regarding the first particle as an oscillating electric dipole creating an electromagnetic field which acts on the second , electrically or magnetically polarizable particle . due to the fact that in the nonretarded limit the electromagnetic field is dominated by the electrostatic field ,",
    "the force on a electrically polarizable particle is stronger than the force on a magnetically polarizable one @xcite .",
    "similar considerations can also be made for other systems .",
    "so , the attractive casimir force between two infinitely permeable plates corresponds to the force between two perfectly conducting plates by virtue of duality , whereas the force between two plates of different type is repulsive and smaller than the equal - type force by a factor of @xmath6 @xcite . for realistic plates",
    "the situation becomes more involved .",
    "in particular , the repulsive casimir force between a purely dielectric and a purely magnetic plate observed in the retarded limit shows the same @xmath7 power law ( @xmath8 , separation of the plates ) as the attractive force between two dielectric plates , whereas in the nonretarded limit the repulsive force behaves like @xmath9 and the attractive force like @xmath10 @xcite . if one of the plates is dielectric while the other one is magnetodielectric , then the electric and magnetic properties of the second plate compete in determining the sign of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "it is known that the force acting on a magnetically polarizable particle in front of a perfectly conducting plate is repulsive in the retarded limit @xcite . by virtue of duality a corresponding repulsive force",
    "is expected to act on an electrically polarizable particle such as a ground - state atom which is located in front of an infinitely permeable plate .",
    "thus the question arises what kind of force could be observed in the case of a genuinely magnetodielectric plate .",
    "maybe the effect of a repulsive force component in such a system is easier accessible to experimental verification than that of a repulsive component of the casimir force between two macroscopic bodies , where force measurements are currently restricted to distance regimes of purely attractive forces @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recently reported production of metamaterials with controllable magnetodielectric properties in the microwave regime @xcite opens the perspective of engineering vdw potentials with desired properties .    in this paper",
    "we consider the vdw interaction of a ground - state atom with planar , dispersing , and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies .",
    "starting from the general expression for the vdw potential in case of an arbitrary planar multilayer system , as can be derived in lowest order of perturbation theory within the frame of qed in linear , causal media , we give a detailed analysis of the vdw potential of the atom being located ( i ) in front of a magnetodielectric plate and ( ii ) beween two magnetodielectric plates .",
    "in particular , we address the question if and how the competition of electric and magnetic properties of the material can give rise to a repulsive force . in this context",
    "we study the influence of effects such as material absorption , finite layer thickness , and multiple reflections .",

    "the provided analysis of typical effects relevant for controlling the vdw force in the case of one and two magnetodielectric plates  namely the competition between electric and magnetic properties of the material in the formation of the potential , material absorption , plate thickness , and multiple reflections  can of course be extended to more complex multilayer systems by further evaluating the general formula for the vdw potential of a ground - state atom in planar multilayer systems .",
