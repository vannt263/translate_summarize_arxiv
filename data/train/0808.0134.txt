    "recently models of opinion dynamics gathered a considerable amount of interest testified by the production of specialized reviews such as  , reinforcing in this way the emergence of the _ sociophysics _",
    "a basic distinction can be done in model of _ continuous opinion with threshold _",
    "@xcite , where opinions can assumed to be well described as continuous quantities ; thus agents update their values because of binary interactions , if their opinions are close enough , i.e. below a given threshold .",
    "the second class consists of models where opinions can be described by _ discrete _",
    "variable , yes / no for instance , and they are updated according to _ local rules , i.e. small group interactions _ as for instance : majority rule  @xcite , majority and inflexible rules  @xcite , majority and contrarian rules  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new model of opinion dynamics which naturally sets at the intersection of the former scheme ; in fact individuals have continuous opinions that are updated if they are below some given threshold , once agents belong to a group , whose size evolves dynamically together with the opinion .",
    "moreover each agent possesses an _ affinity _ with respect to any other agent , the higher is the affinity score the more trustable is the relationship .",
    "such affinity evolves in time because of the past interactions , hence the acquaintances group is determined by the underlying evolving social network .",
    "we hereby provide an application of the model to the study of the consensus ",
    "polarization transition that can occur in real population when people do agree on the same idea  consensus state  or they divide into several opinion groups  polarization state .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and the basic involved parameters , then we present the results concerning the consensus  polarization issue and the time needed to reach such asymptotic state .",
    "we will end with some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the model hereby studied is a generalization of the one proposed in  @xcite because now interactions occur in many ",
    "agents groups , whose size is not fixed a priori but evolves in time .    we are thus considering a fixed population made of @xmath0 agents , i.e. closed group setting , where each agent is characterized by its opinion on a given subject , here represented by a real number @xmath1 $ ] , and moreover each agent possesses an affinity with respect to any other , @xmath2 $ ] : the higher is @xmath3 the more affine , say trustable , the relationships are and consequently agents behave .    at each time step a first agent , say _ i _",

    "i _ is lesser than a given threshold , @xmath5 , will determine the acquaintances group of _ i _ at time @xmath6 in formula : @xmath7 let us observe that the group changes in time , in size and in composition , because the opinions and/or affinities also evolve .",
    "the rationale in the use of the affinities in the definition of the social metric is to interpret  @xcite the affinity as the adjacency matrix of the ( weighted ) social network underlying the population .",
    "we hereby assume a constant threshold @xmath5 for the whole population , but of course one could consider non  homogeneous cases as well .",
    "once the agent _ i _ has been selected and the group @xmath8 has been formed , the involved individuals do interact by possibly updating their opinions and/or affinities .",
    "once in the group , all agents are supposed to listen to and speak to all other agents , therefore every one can perceive a personal _ averaged _  by the mutual affinity ",
    "_ group opinion _ , @xmath9",

    "because the affinity is is general not symmetric , some agents could have been included in the group determined by _",
    "i _ , againsttheir advise ,",
    "hence a second relevant variable is the _ averaged affinity _ that each agent perceives of the group itself   : @xmath15    once the former two quantities have been computed by each agent , we propose the following update scheme : to belong in the largest size group , each agent , would like to come closer to its perceived apopsicentre if it feels himself affine enough to the group : @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] is an activating function , defining the region of trust for effective social interactions , e.g. @xmath18 larger than @xmath19 .    moreover sharing a close opinion ,",

    "the formulation of our model has been inspired by the observation of the way in which the formation mechanisms for social interactions do occur in the real world : a large majority of the processes of formation and evolution of the opinions are driven by group based discussions , such groups are determined by the mutual affinity and/or the shared opinion .",
