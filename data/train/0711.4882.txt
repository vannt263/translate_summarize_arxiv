    "electron transport through a mesoscopic system , e.g. a quantum dot ( qd ) , has been extensively investigated in the last two decades . due to the fact that the size of a mesoscopic device is within the phase coherent length",
    ", the phase of a wave function plays a key role on the electronic transport .",
    "so the transmission amplitude @xmath4 , which describes the electron tunneling through a mesoscopic system , is a complex number .",
    "its magnitude square @xmath5 is the transmission probability which is observable in the measurement of current or conductance .",
    "the transmission phase @xmath6 describes the phase change when an electron tunnels through a device .",
    "this phase @xmath6 is in general lost in the measurement of current or conductance , so that it is difficult to acquire in experiment . using an ab interference ring device , yacoby _ et al . _",
    "@xcite tried , for the first time , to measure the transmission phase @xmath6 through a qd .",
    "couple years later , schuster _",
    "et al_@xcite utilized an open multi - terminal ab ring device to successfully measure the phase @xmath6 . since then , to investigate the transmission phase has generated a great deal of theoretical and experimental interest with a fare amount of efforts focusing in this field .",
    "on the experimental side , for example , buks _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported that controlled decoherence could be achieved in a device with a qd that is capacitively coupled to a quantum point contact in close vicinity .",
    "the phase evolution in the kondo regime was experimentally investigated a few years back,@xcite and was found to be highly sensitive to the onset of kondo correlation .",
    "recently , leturcq _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the magnetic field symmetry and the phase rigidity of the nonlinear conductance in a ab ring . on the other hand ,",
    "the success of these experiments generates a number of theoretical studies . in",
    "early of 1980s , buttiker found the phase rigidity in a two - terminal ab ring device due to the time - reversal symmetry and the current conservation.@xcite after the experiment by schuster _",
    "et al._,@xcite many follow - up theoretical efforts focused on and tried to interpret the measured results of the transmission phase @xmath6 through a qd , in particular , the abrupt lapses of @xmath6 between two adjacent resonances and the similar behavior of @xmath6 for all resonant peaks.@xcite in addition , some works have also studied the transmission phase in the kondo regime,@xcite or with the photon - assisted tunneling process under a time - dependent external field,@xcite etc .",
    "another subject , the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction in a single - molecular qd , has also generated a great deal of interest in recent years .",
    "the phonon - assisted tunneling peaks or steps have been experimentally observed in various single - molecule transistor systems.@xcite park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed phonon - assisted tunneling sub - steps in the i - v curves in a single-@xmath7 transistor device , and those sub - steps are attributed to the coupling of electron and the @xmath7-surface vibration mode . in another experiment by leroy _",
    "et al_.,@xcite the current and the conductance of a suspended individual single - wall nanotube device are measured , and the phonon - assisted sub - peaks on the two sides of the main resonant peak are clearly visible in the differential conductance versus gate voltage , which is due to the radial breathing phonon mode . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the influence of e - ph interaction on the mesoscopic transport is also studied by several groups .",
    "@xcite many interesting results , e.g. the phonon - assisted sub - peaks , etc , are first theoretically predicted , and then experimentally observed .    in this paper , we investigate the transport behavior of a molecular qd system having an e - ph interaction by using the scattering matrix method .",
    "we focus mainly on the transmission phase of the phonon - assisted tunneling sub - peaks , as well as the phonon - induced dephasing process .",
    "the results exhibit that the transmission phase @xmath6 drops between two adjacent ( sub)-peaks and @xmath6 rises again near the position of sub - peaks . in particular , the characteristic of phonon - assisted tunneling process in the transmission phase is much more pronounced and visible than these sub - peaks in the conductance .",
    "afterwards we discuss the dephasing ratio . while at zero temperature and at low bias @xmath8 ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the phonon frequency ) , the electronic transport through the molecular qd is completely coherent because the electron can not absorb or emit phonons under this condition .",
    "however , if at non - zero temperature or at a high bias @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , the dephasing process occurs . in the limit of high bias @xmath11 ( @xmath13 ) , the dephasing ratio goes as square of the e - ph interaction strength @xmath0 in the weak interaction region , but it is linearly dependent on @xmath0 in the strong interaction region .",
    "in addition , we also consider an open ab ring device with a molecular qd embedded in one of its arms , and find that it is feasible to experimentally measure the influence of the e - ph interaction through the transmission phase .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the model and derive the formula of transmission amplitude in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results and their discussions . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the phase measurement by using an open ab ring device . finally , a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "some detailed derivation of the transmission amplitude is given in appendix .",
    "the system under consideration is a molecular qd coupled to left and right leads in the presence of a local phonon mode , and it can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators in the lead @xmath18 and the qd , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operator in the qd . due to large level spacing of the molecular qd ,",
    "only one relevant quantum level @xmath20 is considered .",
    "the electron in the qd is coupled to a single phonon mode @xmath10 , and @xmath0 and @xmath21 describe the strength of the e - ph interaction and the coupling between the qd and the leads , respectively .    in the following ,",
    "we apply the s - matrix scattering formalism to derive the transmission amplitude , the transmission phase and the current . from hamiltonian ( 1 )",
    ", the s matrix can be written as :  @xcite @xmath22 where the single - particle green s function operator @xmath23 is , @xmath24 . by using the @xmath25 matrix",
    ", the final state @xmath26 can be obtained from the initial state @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "considering an initial state @xmath29 , which denotes an electron with energy @xmath30 in the left lead and n phonons in the qd , the final state @xmath26 can be expressed as : @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}[r_m(\\varepsilon_i)\\delta(\\varepsilon_i+n\\omega_0-\\varepsilon_f - m\\omega_0)|\\varepsilon_f , m , l>\\nonumber\\\\ & & + t_m(\\varepsilon_i)\\delta(\\varepsilon_i+n\\omega_0-\\varepsilon_f - m\\omega_0)|\\varepsilon_f , m , r>].\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the transmission amplitude and the reflection amplitude with accompanying absorption or emission of @xmath34 phonons . at zero temperature",
    ", the phonon number @xmath35 in the initial state @xmath27 must be zero and then @xmath36 can be written as ( the detailed derivation is shown in the appendix ) : @xmath37 obviously , @xmath38 describes the amplitude of an elastic tunneling process which is coherent . while @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the amplitude of an inelastic tunneling for emitting @xmath41 phonons .",
    "due to emission of phonons , thus , leaving a trace in the qd for the inelastic tunneling process , an inelastically tunnelled electron loses its phase coherence .",
    "so at zero temperature the transmission phase shift through the qd is :  @xcite @xmath42 from @xmath32 , the total transmission probability ( including the coherent and the non - coherent parts ) through the qd is @xmath43 numerical results and discussions ---------------------------------    in this section , we numerically study the transmission phase @xmath6 and the dephasing ratio @xmath44 . in our numerical calculations ,",
    "the phonon frequency @xmath10 is set as the energy unity ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "notice that the main result of this paper , eq . ( 6 ) , is obtained at zero temperature , and thus so are the numerical results and their discussions .",
    "however , results at low temperature should be similar to that at zero temperature .",
    "1 shows the coherent transmission probability @xmath46 [ namely , @xmath47 and the phase @xmath6 , as a function of renormalized level @xmath48 , which can be tuned by the gate voltage in an experiment .",
    "notice that @xmath46 is proportional to the linear conductance @xmath49 through the qd , @xmath50 .",
    "due to the e - ph interaction , several interesting features are manifested .",
    "in addition to the main peak related to the single level , new satellite sub - peaks appear in the curve of @xmath46-@xmath48 at @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the sub - peaks only exist on the right hand side of the main peak , and their heights increase with the increase of the e - ph coupling strength @xmath0 .",
    "the sub - peak at @xmath53 corresponds to the phonon - assisted tunneling process as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) , in which an incident electron from the left lead first emits a phonon and tunnels to the level @xmath48 , and subsequently reabsorbs a phonon and tunnels forward to the right lead .",
    "since this process does not leave a trace in the qd , it maintains the phase coherence .",
    "meanwhile at zero temperature , there is no phonon in the qd in the initial state and the absorption process can not occur , so that the satellite sub - peaks only exist on the negative @xmath48 side [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] .",
    "next , we study the transmission phase @xmath6 that exhibits a non - monotonic behavior . across the main resonant peak",
    ", @xmath6 continuously rises by a value of @xmath54 .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental findings .",
    "@xcite because of the e - ph interaction , @xmath6 drops between the main peak and the next sub - peak or between two adjacent sub - peaks , and rises again across a sub - peak , such that a dip appears around @xmath55 .",
    "these dips are much more pronounced than those sub - peaks in the transmission probability @xmath46 . for example ,",
    "for @xmath56 the 2-nd phonon - assisted sub - peak is so small that it is hardly visible [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , however even the 4-th dip can be clearly seen [ see fig .",
    "the sensitivity of the transmission phase @xmath6 to the e - ph interaction provides a new way to detect the strength of the e - ph interaction .    in the calculations above , the tunneling coupling strength @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) between the leads and the qd",
    "is set to be quite weak , @xmath59 . with an increase of @xmath57 ,",
    "the phonon - assisted sub - peaks and the main peak in the curve of @xmath46-@xmath48 gradually merge together and become indistinguishable , and the dips in the curve of @xmath6-@xmath48 are also gradually getting smaller ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . while @xmath60 ( e.g. @xmath61 ) , all sub - peaks and all dips are almost invisible .",
    "consequently , in order to experimentally detect the phonon - induced dips of the phase @xmath6 or the phonon - assisted sub - peaks , the coupling strength @xmath57 should be tuned to be less than @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath63 is normally satisfied in the experiments.@xcite    let us study the amplitude @xmath32 ( @xmath64 ) of the inelastic tunneling process .",
    "in this inelastic tunneling process , an incident electron emits @xmath41 phonons while tunneling through the qd .",
    "however it is prohibited when @xmath65 . at small bias case @xmath66 and at zero temperature ,",
    "all inelastic tunneling processes are prohibited and the tunneling through the qd is coherent . on the other hand , with @xmath67 ,",
    "inelastic tunneling processes occur and the tunneling through the qd is partly non - coherent . in the limit of larger bias voltage , @xmath68 , the total dephasing transmission probability @xmath69 is : @xmath70 .",
    "3 shows the dephasing transmission probability @xmath1 ( or @xmath44 ) versus renormalized level @xmath48 and the e - ph interaction strength @xmath0 . while without the e - ph interaction ( namely @xmath71 ) , no inelastic tunneling process happens and thus @xmath72 . when @xmath73 , the inelastic tunneling process occurs and @xmath1 is no longer zero .",
    "a serial of peaks are exhibited in the curve of @xmath1-@xmath48 and the interval between the two adjacent peaks is @xmath10 [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . as is seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) , a higher peak must correspond to a larger value of @xmath0 ( including the peak at @xmath74 ) .",
    "this means that the dephasing probability @xmath1 monotonously increases with the @xmath0 regardless of the position of the renormalized level @xmath48 .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "3(b ) we show the relative dephasing transmission probability @xmath44 versus the e - ph coupling strength @xmath0 in the resonant tunneling region ( namely @xmath75 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is small ( @xmath76 ) , the relative dephasing transmission probability @xmath44 increases parabolically with @xmath0 , but the dephasing probability @xmath44 is found to increase linearly with increasing @xmath0 between the range of @xmath77 . for large @xmath0 case ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 and the dephasing inelastic tunneling processes dominate . in an experiment",
    "the parameter @xmath80 is generally in the range from 0.1 to 1 ,  @xcite though some special devices  @xcite show a big variable range of @xmath81 . in this @xmath82 region , the degree of dephasing is linearly dependent on the e - ph coupling strength .",
    "in sections ii and iii , we only consider a simple device consisting of a qd coupled to two leads .",
    "however , in a real experiment to measure the transmission phase @xmath6 , the device is an open ab ring with a qd embedded in one of the arms.@xcite therefore , it is of experimental relevance to study the open ab ring device in this section .",
    "a qd is embedded in one arm of the ring , and the other arm is the reference arm with the transmission amplitude @xmath83 . due to openness of the open ab ring device , the processes of multi - time circling around the ring is negligible .",
    "note that only elastic tunneling process @xmath84 is in interference with the reference arm .",
    "@xmath85 , defined as the probability that an electron of energy @xmath30 incident from the left lead will be transmitted with energy @xmath86 into the right lead , can therefore be written as : @xmath87 is the magnetic flux inside the ring . in the absence of the reference arm ( namely , @xmath88 )",
    ", @xmath85 is reduced to latexmath:[$t(\\varepsilon_f,\\varepsilon_i ) = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\delta(\\varepsilon_i-\\varepsilon_f - m\\omega_0 )    work by wingreen _",
    "et al . _",

    "finnaly , the differential conductance @xmath95 can obtained from @xmath96 .    based on eq.(10 )",
    ", we show the numerical results of the current @xmath97 flowing through the open ab ring in fig.4 . fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(b ) correspond to small and large bias voltage cases , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the phonon - assisted sub - peaks can be seen on the right hand side of the main peak , and the sub - peak height increases with increasing e - ph coupling strength @xmath0 .",
    "these results of current are similar to those in the previous paper.@xcite    next , we focus on the differential conductance @xmath95 ( @xmath98 ) and its dependence on the renormalized level @xmath48 or on the magnetic flux @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , @xmath48 and @xmath99 can be well controlled and are continuously tunable in an experiment .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath95 is always a periodic function of the magnetic flux @xmath99 with a period of @xmath100 .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) show the linear conductance @xmath95 at zero bias voltage . here a series of phonon - assisted sub - peaks exhibits in the curve of @xmath95 versus @xmath48 , similar to that in the transmission probability @xmath46 [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] because of small value of @xmath83 . besides",
    ", the phonon - assisted tunneling processes can also be observed from the amplitude of the @xmath95 oscillation versus the magnetic flux @xmath99 [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] . while @xmath74 or @xmath101 ( i.e. at the main peak or the 1-st sub - peak ) , the ab oscillation amplitudes are quite large since the phonon - assisted elastic tunneling processes play a role here .",
    "but at the position between two adjacent peaks ( e.g. @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) , the ab oscillation amplitude is quite weak .",
    "when a small bias voltage is applied between the left and right leads , all peaks in the curve of @xmath95-@xmath48 , including the main peak and phonon - assisted sub - peaks , split into two [ see fig .",
    "5(c ) ] , and their positions are at @xmath104 .",
    "the reason is that at these values of @xmath105 , the renormalized level @xmath48 is in line with the left or the right chemical potential @xmath106 , or the distance between @xmath48 and @xmath107 is just @xmath108 .",
    "the behavior of the conductance @xmath95 versus the magnetic flux @xmath99 for small bias is similar with that of the linear conductance [ see figs",
    ". 5(b ) and 5(d ) ] .",
    "note that at zero bias or at small bias ( @xmath109 ) all tunnelings through the qd are completely coherent , and the small amplitude oscillation in @xmath95 is due to the small transmission probability @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we investigate the large bias case ( @xmath12 ) . at large bias",
    "@xmath11 the peaks in the curve of @xmath95 versus @xmath48 clearly split into two with an interval of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , some extra sub - peaks emerge even on the left of the main peak . for example , the sub - peak marked by `` b '' in fig .",
    "5(e ) stands on the left of the main peak at @xmath110 , and their interval is @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , this peak is from the inelastic tunneling process @xmath111 and a phonon is left in the qd with an electron tunneling through the dot .",
    "5(f ) shows the conductance @xmath95 versus the magnetic flux @xmath99 while the level @xmath48 is fixed on the peak positions of fig .",
    "the amplitude of the ab oscillation of the peak `` b '' is very weak , but the amplitudes are quite large for other three peaks .",
    "this gives a proof that the peak `` b '' is indeed from the inelastic tunneling process and the corresponding tunneling electron losses its phase coherent .",
    "since the differential conductance @xmath95 is a periodic function of the magnetic flux @xmath99 , one can make the fourier expansion : @xmath112 . here",
    "the initial phase @xmath113 is a direct experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "let us compare the measured phase @xmath113 with the transmission phase @xmath6 .",
    "6 shows the phase @xmath113 versus @xmath48 for different bias @xmath11 . while at zero bias voltage the characteristics of the phase @xmath113 , including the phonon - induced dips , are completely the same as the transmission phase @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "when a small bias voltage ( e.g. @xmath114 ) is applied between the two leads , the phase @xmath113 changes slightly but can still reflect the transmission phase @xmath6 quantitatively . so at zero or small bias the transmission phase @xmath6 , including the intriguing characteristics due to the e - ph interaction , can be directly observed through the measurement of differential conductance versus the intra - dot level . for a molecular qd device , the phonon frequency @xmath10 is usually from 5mev to 35mev,@xcite so the condition @xmath109 is easily reachable . on the other hand , at large bias case ( e.g. @xmath115 ) , the phase @xmath113 deviates severally from the transmission phase @xmath6 .",
    "in summary , we study the influence of the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction on the transmission phase and the dephasing while electron tunneling through a molecular quantum dot .",
    "it is found that the transmission phase versus the intra - dot level exhibits a non - monotonic behavior , and a pronounced dip emerges when the renormalized level locates at the position of the phonon - assisted sub - peaks . in particular , phonon - induced dips in the transmission phase are much more apparent than the phonon - assisted sub - peaks in the conductance . besides",
    ", phonon - induce dephasing increases monotonically with the e - ph interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "the dephasing probability @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath116 at small @xmath0 , but @xmath3 for large @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the open ab ring device is investigated . at zero bias or small bias ,",
    "the measurement phase from the differential conductance versus the magnetic flux is found to have the same characteristics with the transmission phase , including the phonon - induced dips .",

    "<S> the influence of electron - phonon interaction on the transmission phase shift of an electron passing through a quantum dot is investigated by using the scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission phase versus the intra - dot level shows a serial of phonon - induced dips . </S>",
    "<S> these dips are highly sensitive to electron - phonon interaction strength @xmath0 , and they are much more pronounced than phonon - assisted sub - peaks appeared in the conductance . </S>",
    "<S> phonon - induce dephasing is also studied , and the results show that the dephasing probability @xmath1 monotonically increases with the electron - phonon interaction strength @xmath0 . the dephasing probability @xmath2 for small @xmath0 but @xmath3 at large @xmath0 . </S>"
