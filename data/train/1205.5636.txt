    "inspired by the projection method of the ground states of 2d systems @xcite and the linearized trg method for thermodynamic properties of 1d systems @xcite , we represent the finite temperature density operator of the 2d quantum model with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) closed tensor network ( tn ) that consists of the initial tensor product density operator ( tpdo ) and the 3d brick - wall tn for the evolution along the imaginary time direction .",

    "in accordance with the general definition of the tn s , we define a tn as a network consisting of the product of tensors ( @xmath1 ) and vectors ( @xmath2 ) , as shown in fig .",
