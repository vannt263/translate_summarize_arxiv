    "the cosmic gamma - ray burst distance scale was a mystery until the recent discovery of x - ray afterglows by bepposax , and of optical and radio afterglows from some of these grbs .",
    "these observations have made it possible to estimate the grb distance scale from the redshift of the optical counterparts .",
    "four spectroscopic redshift measurements have now been obtained : z=0.835 for grb970508 ( metzger et al . 1997 ; bloom et al .",
    "1998a ) , z = 3.4 for grb971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) , z= 0.966 for grb980703 ( djorgovski et al . 1998 ) , and z=1.6 for grb990123 ( hjorth et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the nature of the host galaxies in these cases is not clear , although in one case , the host appears to be in an active star - formation phase ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1998 ) . while it is now generally accepted that grbs are at cosmological distances , the picture is clouded by the apparent association of one burst , grb980425 , with a nearby ( z=0.008 ) supernova , sn1998bw , in a barred spiral galaxy , eso184-g82 ( galama et al .",
    "although there is evidence that grbs are not _ generally associated with supernovae ( kippen et al .",
    "1998 ) , it has been argued that perhaps 1% could be ( bloom et al .",
    "similarly , it has been argued that grbs are associated with abell clusters ( kolatt and piran 1996 ; struble and rood 1997 ) and radio - quiet quasars ( schartel et al .",
    "1997 ) . while the latter two associations are probably not valid ( hurley et al .",
    "1999 ) , all these claimed associations serve to demonstrate that the nature of grb host galaxies is not yet well understood . indeed",
    ", the evidence is not inconsistent with the suggestion that short gamma - ray bursts have a different origin from long ones ( pizzichini 1995 ; belli , 1997 ; tavani 1998 ; but see also kouveliotou et al .",
    "1996 and pendleton et al .",
    "counterpart observations in the x - ray , optical , and radio ranges at various times after the bursts will continue to be valuable for unraveling these issues .",
    "_    in this paper , we present rosat soft x - ray observations of four grb error boxes .",
    "the objective of this study was to detect quiescent x - ray counterparts to grb sources .",
    "accordingly , the observations took place years after the bursts .",
    "( at the sensitivity levels of this survey , the fading x - ray counterparts to these bursts would have been undetectable days to a week after the bursts . )",
    "the grb locations were obtained with the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , composed of _",
    "ulysses , batse aboard the _ compton gamma ray observatory , and either the _ pioneer venus orbiter or _ mars observer spacecraft at the times of these bursts .",
    "the error boxes have been published in laros et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) , and the properties of the bursts have appeared in meegan et al .",
    "the bursts were selected for study based on three criteria : their high galactic latitude and/or the error box area ( from which the probability of detecting a random source within the error box can be estimated ) , and the maximum error box dimension ( so that the error box could be covered in a single rosat high resolution imager pointing ) .",
    "table 1 gives the properties of the bursts and the results of the observations .",
    "the batse trigger number ( meegan et al . 1996 ) appears in the first row , and the rosat sequence number in the second .",
    "the galactic latitude and error box area are given in the next two rows .",
    "row 5 gives the approximate 25 - 150 kev fluence , estimated from the _ ulysses observations ; all of the bursts are rather bright ( or they would not have been detected by the relatively small instruments of the ipn ) , and thus , presumably , relatively nearby .",
    "the following row gives the total effective observation time by rosat .",
    "all observations took place with the high resolution imager , in the 0.07 - 2.4 kev energy band .",
    "row 7 gives the elapsed time between the burst and the observation . in this particular study",
    ", no attempt was made to minimize this time interval , as the objective was the study of long - lived , quiescent counterparts .",
    "row 8 indicates whether a source was observed within the ipn error box .",
    "row 9 gives the number of sources in the hri field of view .",
    "row 10 gives the _ a posteriori probability of finding a source in the error box by chance .",
    "it is calculated simply as the number of sources times ratio of the error box area to the area of the hri field of view .",
    "( the number of sources is consistent with the number of background sources expected at these sensitivity levels . ) row 11 gives the hydrogen column density along the line of sight .",
    "the last 3 rows give the upper limits to the 0.1 - 2.4 kev flux of any source in the error box assuming thermal bremsstrahlung , blackbody , and power law spectra , corrected for the foreground column density .",
    "depending on the column density and the assumed spectral form , different spectral parameters may result in upper limits which differ by a factor two to three .",
    "_ _    the rosat data were analyzed using the standard data analysis tools and data cuts . in these observations",
    ", there is presently a boresight error that is generally less than 10 @xmath5 .",
    "as this is much smaller than the error box sizes , and since the boresight - corrected data were not all available at the time of this writing , we have ignored this .",
    "the data selection criteria are given in gruber et al .",
    "the iraf / pros sliding window source detection technique and software were used to identify the sources in each image ( we used a signal to noise ratio of 3 for our source detection criterion ) . to obtain the 3 @xmath2 upper limits , the source counts and background counts were taken from the same image .",
    "the source box center was at the grb error box center .",
    "the background box was centered at a location where it excluded the grb error box and any sources in the field .",
    "the box size was initially chosen to be @xmath6 .",
    "the rosat hri point spread function is such that this box contains 90@xmath7 of the energy of a point source .",
    "the box size was the same for both source and background estimates .",
    "the column density for each grb error box was obtained from the heasarc .",
    "the hri images with the grb error boxes are shown in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "the 3 @xmath2 count upper limit was then converted to flux for three assumed spectral models since the hri does not give spectral information .",
    "for the thermal bremsstrahlung and blackbody models , a temperature kt = 1 kev was assumed .",
    "for the power law model , the assumed photon spectral index was -1 . with the kt or spectral index and the line - of - sight column density , we used pimms ( portable interactive multi - mission simulator , available through the heasarc ) to convert the 3 @xmath2 count rate upper limit to a 0.1 - 2.4 kev 3 @xmath2 flux upper limit .",
    "all of the bursts in table 1 would probably be classified as `` long '' .",
    "one possible exception is grb920325 .",
    "no duration is given for this event in the batse catalog ( meegan et al .",
    "the burst consists of a short ( @xmath8 1 s ) initial spike , but is followed by low - level emission for several seconds .",
    "the next shortest event , grb930706 , has a t@xmath9 duration of 2.7 s , placing it between the `` short '' and `` long '' peaks of the duration distribution , but on the shoulder of the `` long '' bursts .",
    "we therefore assume that these grbs are similar to the four for which redshifts have been measured , and that they originated in or very close to galaxies .",
    "the x - ray flux upper limits may therefore be used to derive lower limits to the distances of the hosts . from this , in turn , we may obtain lower limits on the grb energy .",
    "galaxies display a wide range of x - ray luminosities .",
    "the x - rays from normal galaxies come from individual sources such as binaries and supernova remnants , as well as from a hot phase of the interstellar medium , heated by supernovae ; their x - ray luminosities range from @xmath10 ( fabbiano 1989 ) . the x - ray emission from agn s",
    "is thought to be powered by supermassive black holes ; agn x - ray luminosities range from @xmath11 ( maccacaro et al .",
    "perhaps more relevant to the host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts , studies of faint galaxies ( b @xmath12 23 ) at redshifts 0.1 @xmath8 z @xmath8 0.5 show that they have x - ray luminosities @xmath13 ( roche et al .",
    "these rather large x - ray luminosities are apparently not due to a malmquist bias , since their @xmath14 ratios are an order of magnitude larger than most local galaxies .",
    "finally , studies of star - forming galaxies , whose x - ray emission may be due to massive x - ray binaries , indicate that their luminosities are @xmath15 ( griffiths and padovani 1990 ) .    in an @xmath16 universe , the quiescent x - ray luminosity l@xmath17 , the luminosity distance d@xmath18 , and the observed x - ray flux f@xmath19",
    "are related through @xmath20 where z is the redshift , and the photon spectrum of the quiescent x - ray source is assumed to be a power law with photon index @xmath21 .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by @xmath22 where c is the speed of light and h@xmath17 is the hubble constant .",
    "equations 1 and 2 may be used to derive a lower limit to the redshift of each of the four bursts , assuming a specific galaxy type . from this",
    ", the total gamma - ray energy in the burst may be calculated : @xmath23 where f is the burst fluence , and the spectral shape of the burst is assumed to be a power law with photon index n. in table 2 , distance lower limits to each burst are given for the four galaxy types , for the lower and upper limit to the x - ray luminosity . a lower limit to the total isotropic burst energy",
    "is also calculated .",
    "we have assumed that the x - ray spectrum is given by a power law with @xmath24 and that the grb spectrum is described by a power law with @xmath25 , and have taken h@xmath17=65 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 .",
    "again , different assumptions about spectral parameters , as well as cosmological constants , will result in different limits .",
    "numerous multi - wavelength follow - up observations have been performed on the four grb error boxes in this study , including barthelmy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( schmidt telescope observations ) ; luginbuhl et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( ubvi observations at the usno ) ; hurley et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( extreme ultraviolet observation with the _ euve spacecraft ) ; luginbuhl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( optical observations at usno and ctio ) ; schaefer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( _ hubble space telescope observations in the b , u , and uv bands ) ; larson and mclean ( 1997 ) ( near - infrared observations ) ; schaefer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( ground - based optical observations ) ; and vrba et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( ubvi observations at the usno ) .",
    "although no counterparts were identified in any of these observations , the sensitivities in many cases would have been insufficient to detect the faint galaxies which have been found in later studies by searching at the precisely known positions of the brighter optical transients . except for grb980425 ,",
    "where the association of the galaxy with the grb is still debatable , the nature of the host galaxies found so far is uncertain .",
    "if they are faint or star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 , and if the four bursts in this study have similar hosts , then it is clear from table 2 why no quiescent x - ray sources were detected ; the sensitivity would have allowed the detection of such objects only out to redshifts of @xmath10.2 at best .",
    "_ _    assuming a sensitivity of @xmath27 for a deep axaf or xmm observation , the quiescent x - ray emission from normal , faint , or star - forming galaxies could be detected out to redshifts of 0.3 , 0.8 , and 0.2 , respectively .",
    "it is therefore possible that the quiescent x - ray counterparts to the closer bursts could be detected .",
    "it is also possible that the short grbs originate at smaller distances ( as their number - intensity relation suggests ) , making the x - ray detection of their host galaxies feasible .",
