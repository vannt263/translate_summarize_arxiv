    "this static solution of the scalar model gives the appropriate moving soliton solution with the aid of lorentz transform .",
    "as it was shown in the cited work @xcite , in the case of nonlinear electrodynamics there are the conformity between long - range interaction of solitons and two known long - range interactions of physical particles , that is electromagnetic and gravitational ones .",
    "but the methods which was used for the investigation of soliton long - range interaction are independent of the field model .",

    "an essential space - time nonhomogeneous of soliton solution may provide the necessary symmetry properties for the beam .",

    "we obtain its singular exact soliton solutions propagating with the speed of light and having energy , momentum , and angular momentum which can be calculated for explicit conditions . such solitons will be called the lightlike ones .    then we investigate in detail a lightlike soliton solution having a rotation about the direction of propagation that is twisted lightlike soliton .",

    "we have the simple space - time fourier components , which satisfies the periodic boundary conditions .    in the case of arbitrary volume with cavities ,",
    "the finding of volume modes looks very complicated .",

    "also we take that each soliton in the volume has one of its allowed frequencies .    hereafter up to formulas ( [ 558433091 ] )",
    "we obtain the equilibrium distribution function by soliton frequencies .",
