    "recently , quantum memory for light has been demonstrated in the copenhagen lab @xcite where the setup was almost identical to a previous experiment demonstrating long - lived entanglement of two macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "both schemes involve two cells with macroscopic numbers of cesium atoms whose spins are polarized in antiparallel directions , perpendicular to the direction of light propagation through the cells .",
    "off - resonant interaction between the beam and the atoms causes ac stark shift of the atomic levels and faraday rotation of the light polarization .",
    "it has been shown that the combined effect corresponds to the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) interaction between atomic and light variables @xcite which can be used in many quantum information protocols @xcite . in both schemes @xcite the two samples are placed in a homogeneous magnetic field which causes larmor precession of the atomic spins .",
    "the reason for this is that the polarization rotation is then observed at frequency sidebands sufficiently displaced from the light frequency @xmath0 , which enables us to avoid technical noises .",
    "whereas in the entanglement scheme @xcite the presence of two samples was essential to demonstrate entanglement of two objects , in the memory scheme @xcite it just helps constructing the qnd hamiltonian with the precessing spins : two light modes oscillating at frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 must be somehow matched with two atomic modes , and using two samples does the job .",
    "( were there no technical noises , one could use directly the carrier optical frequency @xmath0 and work with a single memory cell without using magnetic field and larmor precession . )",
    "although the scheme demonstrates the feasibility of a memory preserving quantum features of light pulses , it has some disadvantages .",
    "first , using two vapor cells per each stored mode increases the resources needed .",
    "moreover , each time the light beam crosses the walls of the cell , losses occur which increase the noise .",
    "this could lead to distortion of some quantum features that then could not be recovered with sufficient fidelity .",
    "we propose here a scheme that uses a single vapor cell and still is able to involve the full qnd interaction between atoms and optical signal at a sideband mode .",
    "the working medium and physical parameters chosen for the discussion are similar to those in the copenhagen experiment @xcite , even though the principles are valid for more general atomic systems .",
    "the important tricks are initial pumping of the atoms with a suitable linearly polarized light , and applying magnetic , optical , or microwave pulses to induce nonlinear zeeman or stark splitting of the atomic levels which transform the relevant quadratures .",
    "let us first discuss the principles of the atom - light qnd interaction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "atoms in the cell interact with light pulses traveling in the @xmath3 direction and with a magnetic field in the @xmath4 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ f - scheme1 ] ) .",
    "the atoms are initially pumped into one of the hyperfine levels of the ground electronic state . the magnetic field @xmath5 causes larmor precession of the atomic spins around the @xmath4 axis with frequency @xmath6 .",
    "each pulse has a strong component which is @xmath4 polarized and oscillates at optical frequency @xmath7 and a weak quantum component which is @xmath8-polarized .",
    "the atom - field interaction hamiltonian is @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath4 polarized photons at frequency @xmath0 off resonance of some atomic transition line , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation operators of @xmath8 polarized photons at the sideband frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , @xmath15 is the coherence between the atomic magnetic states @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the relevant hyperfine level with @xmath4 as the quantization axis .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath18 depends on the used isotope and particular transition . as an example , working with cesium pumped into the @xmath19 hyperfine level of the ground electronic state @xmath20 and using light near the d2 line , the coupling is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the dipole moment element of the optical transition related to the spontaneous decay rate @xmath23 by @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the vacuum electric field , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the quantization volume , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the transversal area and duration of the optical pulse , respectively .",
    "the detuning @xmath30 is the frequency difference between the optical field and the given atomic d2 transition and is assumed to be much larger than the hyperfine splitting in that level and much smaller than detuning from any other atomic level .",
    "it is convenient to work with nonmonochromatic modes @xmath31 and @xmath32 , whose field quadratures @xmath33 , @xmath34 are measured using homodyne detection as the cosine and sine signal components oscillating at frequency @xmath35 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hafprime ] ) is simplified when the @xmath10 mode is in a strong coherent state @xmath36 with @xmath37 real and the atoms are initially prepared in one of the extreme states , @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "let us assume that atoms denoted by index 1 are initially pumped into state @xmath38 so that only the coherences @xmath40 and @xmath41 are non - negligible , and atoms denoted by index 2 are initially pumped into state @xmath39 so that only the coherences @xmath42 and @xmath43 are non - negligible .",
    "then after summing over all @xmath44 atoms of each kind , the interaction hamiltonians for the two classes of atoms become @xmath45 here the atomic quadratures are defined as @xmath46 the coupling constant is @xmath47 , with the photon number @xmath48 , and the index @xmath49 denoting individual atoms . since for atoms 1 the populations @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , one can see that @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfy the commutation relation @xmath55=i$ ] , and similarly for atoms 2 , @xmath56=i$ ] .",
    "if the light beam interacts with both classes of atoms , the total hamiltonian @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the quadratures satisfy the cannonical commutation relations @xmath60=i$ ] and @xmath61=i$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ qndtot ] ) describes the qnd interactions in two independent pairs of systems .",
    "the atomic `` @xmath62 '' mode interacts with the light cosine mode and the atomic `` @xmath63 '' mode interacts with the light sine mode .",
    "in contrast , each of the hamiltonians ( [ qnd1 ] ) and ( [ qnd2 ] ) would lead to unwanted intermodal coupling of light modes c and s. thus , with precessing spins one needs two classes of atoms to construct a qnd interaction coupling one atomic mode with one light mode .    in the experiment @xcite these two classes of oppositely polarized atoms were kept separately in two vapor cells .",
    "the initial pumping was achieved by circularly polarized light beams propagating in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "however , there is no principal reason why these two classes of atoms should not share the same cell .",
    "one only has to deal with a few tasks : pump the atoms into a mixture of states @xmath64 , make sure that the coherences in atoms 1 and 2 oscillate with the same frequencies , and make sure that one can rotate the atomic quadratures of each mode on demand .",
    "to prepare a mixture of both atomic classes one can use a light beam propagating in the @xmath3 direction , linearly polarized in the @xmath4 direction and tuned into resonance with the @xmath65 transition ( see fig .",
    "[ f - pumping1 ] ) .",
    "light polarized along the quantization axis couples states with the same magnetic quantum number @xmath16 so that the two extreme states with @xmath66 remain uncoupled and act as dark states with respect to the pump field . if one applies also a repump field driving the atoms out of the remaining hyperfine level ( similarly as in @xcite ) , all atoms finally end up in one of the two dark states . with cesium atoms",
    ", one can drive the transition between the electronic ground state 6@xmath67s@xmath68 and the excited state 6@xmath67p@xmath69 with the d1 line 894.6 nm light .    to avoid coupling of the pumping beam to the @xmath66 states",
    ", one must make sure that the pump light stays sufficiently far from resonance of the neighboring 6@xmath67p@xmath70 state .",
    "this means that one has to take into account doppler broadening of the transition .",
    "fortunately , the doppler linewidth of the room temperature cesium atoms is @xmath71190  mhz @xcite which is much less than the hyperfine splitting of the d1 line @xmath72 1168  mhz .",
    "the occupation probability of the unwanted states @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath74 , which is sufficiently low .",
    "a more serious effect can stem from the fact that during collisions of oppositely polarized atoms the electrons can exchange their spins .",
    "during such a collision the atom can be brougth out of the manifold of states with @xmath19 , and/or , the correlations of its coherences @xmath75 with other atoms in the sample are averaged to zero .",
    "this effect ( absent in samples with all spins oriented in the same direction ) will contribute to the decoherence .",
    "fortunately , each atom has a rather small probability @xmath76 to have such a spin exchanging collision during the relevant time @xmath77 , namely @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the electron spin exchange cross section ( for cesium it is @xmath80 @xmath81 @xcite ) , the density of atoms with opposite polarization is @xmath82 @xmath83 and the speed is @xmath84 m / s . during the interaction time",
    "@xmath85 ms the spin exchange collision probability is thus @xmath86 .",
    "the influence on the atomic quadratures can be found following the line in @xcite : the quadrature mean values are shortened by a fraction @xmath87 and additional fluctuation @xmath87 is added to them . since @xmath88",
    ", states with phase - space features not finer than @xmath76 will not be seriously influenced by the spin exchanging collisions .",
    "in weak magnetic fields the oscillation frequency of coherences between neighboring magnetic states is nearly proportional to @xmath5 and independent of @xmath16 .",
    "however , in stronger fields nonlinear zeeman shift occurs that causes differences between the oscillation frequencies of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , the difference between the neighboring energy levels is up to the second order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 with @xmath93 the magnetic dipole moment and @xmath94 is the hyperfine splitting of the ground state , which for cesium is @xmath959.19  ghz .",
    "the difference of rotation frequencies of the two classes is @xmath96 . assuming the typical light pulse duration @xmath97 1  ms and oscillation frequency @xmath98  khz as in @xcite , one finds that the phase difference between the two coherences accumulated during the evolution would be @xmath99 which is not negligible . in the double - cell scheme",
    "one can solve this problem by tuning the magnetic fields in the two cells differently so that the field difference compensates for the quadratic zeeman shift .",
    "this can not be done in the single cell scheme so that one has to look for another solution .",
    "one option is to work with weaker magnetic fields .",
    "for example , with the larmor frequency @xmath100  khz the quadratic zeeman shift would lead to the accumulated phase difference of @xmath101  mrad which can be neglected .",
    "however , the laser signal on the lower - frequency sidebands can be much noisier than on higher frequencies so that one may prefer staying with stronger magnetic fields .",
    "another option is to use ac stark shift compensating for the nonlinear zeeman shift .",
    "we propose using suitably polarized field detuned from the d1 transitions , e.g. in cesium , 6@xmath67s@xmath102 6@xmath67p@xmath69 and 6@xmath67s@xmath102 6@xmath67p@xmath70 .",
    "note that the signal close to the d2 transition does not interfere with this auxiliary field . as the best candidate appears a field linearly polarized in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the stark shift of the magnetic levels is then @xmath103 where the dipole moment squares are @xmath104 @xmath105 is the detuning of the field with respect to the transition to the hyperfine level @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is the stark - shifting field intensity .",
    "if we denote by @xmath108 the detuning of the field with respect to the center of the two @xmath109 transitions , the shift of the frequencies between the neighboring levels @xmath110/\\hbar$ ] is @xmath111 whereas for tuning between the two d1 transitions to @xmath109 , @xmath112 , the stark shift depends on @xmath16 in the same way as the quadratic zeeman shift , for larger detunings @xmath113 the two shifts ( [ zeemanshift ] ) and ( [ starkshiftpi ] ) have opposite dependences .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 dependent parts of the two shifts cancel each other if the field intensity is @xmath114    when working with additional optical fields , one has to estimate their influence on atomic decoherence by photon scattering .",
    "the scattering rate of photons absorbed and spontaneously reemitted by an atom detuned by @xmath115 from the photon frequency is @xcite @xmath116 where the saturation parameter is @xmath117 and the saturation intensity is @xmath118 .",
    "we have to integrate @xmath119 over @xmath115 with a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath120 and having the half - width @xmath121 . for our values with @xmath98  khz and assuming @xmath122  ghz , the required intensity is @xmath123  mw / cm@xmath67 and would lead to the scattering rate of @xmath125  s@xmath126 which is much less than the estimated scattering rate due to the probe in the copenhagen experiments @xmath127  s@xmath126 @xcite .",
    "this shows that the auxiliary field will not disturb seriously the atomic memory .",
    "one can use microwave field tuned off - resonance with respect to the transition between the two hyperfine levels .",
    "let us assume @xmath128-polarized field with magnetic field polarized in the @xmath4-direction , whose frequency is detuned by @xmath129 from the hyperfine frequency @xmath94 , and whose intensity is @xmath130 .",
    "the energy shift of the @xmath16 state is then @xmath131 where the magnetic dipole moment element between the @xmath16 states of the two hyperfine levels in cesium is @xmath132 , and @xmath93 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the shift of the frequencies between the neighboring levels @xmath133/\\hbar$ ] is @xmath134 the ac zeeman shift ( [ aczeeman ] ) compensates the nonlinear zeeman shift ( [ zeemanshift ] ) for the microwave field intensity @xmath135 if we use for the detuning @xmath129 about ten times the frequency difference between the hyperfine transition with @xmath136 and with @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138  mhz , the intensity with @xmath139  khz should be @xmath140  w / cm@xmath67 .",
    "although the above discussion shows the availability of the qnd hamiltonian ( [ qndtot ] ) , to be useful as a quantum memory medium , one has to be able to manipulate to some extent the atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "an important operation is rotation of the atomic quadratures of each mode @xcite , in our case , e.g. , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and similarly for the `` @xmath63 '' mode . in the two - cell schemes",
    "this is achieved by magnetic pulses acting separately on each atomic sample .",
    "for example , a magnetic @xmath143 pulse in one cell causes the zeeman shift yielding the rotation @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "however , _ oppositely oriented _",
    "magnetic @xmath143 pulse in the other cell would cause the corresponding rotation @xmath146 and @xmath147 which would lead to the desired transformation of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the definition of the collective quadratures @xmath150 and @xmath151 in ( [ xa2 ] ) and ( [ pa2 ] ) means that these quadratures would respond oppositely in weak magnetic fields in comparison to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "thus , if one used the same weak magnetic pulse for the two classes of atoms in the same cell , the two atomic modes would mix : @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , @xmath157 .    to solve this problem",
    "one can take advantage of the frequency difference of the coherences @xmath89 and @xmath90 caused by the nonlinear stationary zeeman effect , by the ac stark shift , and/or by the ac zeeman shift .",
    "when using the nonlinear zeeman effect , one can apply a sufficiently strong magnetic field for a short time . during the magnetic pulse atoms",
    "complete many 2@xmath128 rotations , however atoms in the @xmath158 class would end up half a rotation ahead in comparison to those in the @xmath159 class . to achieve this , one can use a magnetic pulse of duration @xmath77 such that @xmath160 .",
    "if the time is chosen @xmath161  @xmath162s ( i.e. , much shorter than the 1  ms reading and writing pulses ) , one finds that the linear frequency should be @xmath163  mhz corresponding to @xmath164  g. although feasible in principle , it can be technically rather challenging to produce such strong , precisely controlled , short magnetic pulses .",
    "another option is to apply a stark - shifting optical pulse , similarly as in the preceding paragraphs .",
    "the field produces state - dependent energy shift leading to increased frequency difference of the coherences @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "when the pulse duration is @xmath77 , the field intensity should be such that @xmath165 .",
    "( [ starkshiftpi ] ) for a @xmath128 polarized pulse , one finds the condition @xmath166 where the approximation is valid for @xmath167 . as an example , let us consider @xmath122  ghz and @xmath168s , which would require field intensity @xmath169 135 mw / cm@xmath67 .",
    "the number of scattered photons is in this case @xmath170 which is smaller than the number of photons scattered from the information carrying pulses @xmath171 .",
    "note that when increasing the detuning and field intensity , the number of scattered photons approaches its limit @xmath172 .",
    "when a source of suitably polarized microwave field is available , one can take advantage of the @xmath16 dependence of the ac zeeman shift as in eq .",
    "( [ aczeeman ] ) .",
    "if a @xmath128 phase difference between the two atomic classes is to be achieved during time @xmath77 , one needs the microwave field intensity @xmath173 assuming as in the preceding section @xmath174  mhz and @xmath175s we get the required microwave field intensity @xmath176 170  w / cm@xmath67 .",
    "we have shown how a single atomic vapor cell can be used as a quantum memory for light with the quantum signal encoded at two sideband frequencies .",
    "the sideband encoding is required so as to suppress technical noises that would occur if one measures the light signal by integration of the cw homodyne signal over the pulse duration ( typically a millisecond ) .",
    "the two sideband modes must be matched by two atomic modes ; we have shown how to use two atomic coherences in one sample rather than using one cell for each atomic mode .",
    "the single - cell approach could substantially reduce the losses of light occurring at the boundaries between different media ( air , paraffin coated glass walls of the cells , atomic vapor ) and save the resources needed .",
    "the losses would be especially disturbing if squeezed states are to be manipulated : absorption of @xmath177 at each boundary would add @xmath178 of vacuum noise to the signal .",
    "thus , with small losses @xmath179 , if a beam with a perfectly squeezed quadrature crosses four boundaries ( when working with the double - cell scheme ) , the noise added to the squeezed quadrature would be twice as big as when crossing two boundaries ( single cell scheme ) .",
    "the scheme requires selective addressing of atoms in the @xmath158 and @xmath159 manifolds , which react differently to strong stationary magnetic fields ( nonlinear zeeman effect ) , to stark - shifting optical pulses , or to microwave fields ( ac zeeman shift ) .",
    "experimentalists will have to find the best combination of these approaches to trade - off between their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "when applied , the scheme should enhance our capabilities of storing and processing quantum information carried by light .",
