    "it had been conjectured that many critical two - dimensional models from statistical physics are conformally invariant in the scaling limit ; for instance , percolation , ising / potts models , fk percolation or dimers .",

    "cardy @xcite used conformal field theory techniques to predict an explicit formula ( involving a hypergeometric function ) that should describe crossing probabilities of conformal rectangles for critical percolation as a function of the aspect ratio of the rectangle .",
    "carleson pointed out that cardy s formula could be expressed in a much simpler way by choosing another geometric setup , specifically by mapping the rectangle onto an equilateral triangle @xmath0 .",
    "the formula can then be simply described by saying that the probability of a crossing ( in the triangle ) between @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 $ ] is @xmath4 .",
    "smirnov @xcite proved rigorously cardy s formula for critical site percolation on the triangular lattice and his proof uses the global geometry of the equilateral triangle ( more than the local geometry of the triangular lattice ) .    in the present paper , we show that each @xmath5 is in some sense naturally associated to some geometrical normalization in that the formulas corresponding to cardy s formula can again be expressed in a simple way . combining this with the conjectures on continuous limits of various discrete models , this yields precise simple conjectures on some asymptotics for these models in particular geometric setups .",
    "just as percolation may be associated with equilateral triangles , it turns that , for instance , the critical 2d ising model ( and the fk percolation with parameter @xmath6 ) seems to be associated with right - angled isosceles triangles ( because @xmath7 hitting probabilities in such triangles are `` uniform '' ) .",
    "other isosceles triangles correspond to fk percolation with different values of the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 corresponds to isosceles triangle with angle @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , double dimer - models or @xmath11 potts models ( conjectured to correspond to @xmath12 ) seem to be best expressed in strips ( i.e. , domains like @xmath13 $ ] ) , and half - strips ( i.e. , @xmath14 $ ] ) are a favorable geometry for uniform spanning trees .    * acknowledgments . *",

    "now it is easily seen that for any @xmath291 , @xmath292 , if @xmath314 designates the right boundary of a @xmath285 process starting from @xmath301 , then a simple consequence of scaling is the existence of a function @xmath315 such that : @xmath316 moreover , this function is not identically zero if @xmath317 .",
