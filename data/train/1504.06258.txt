    "hybrid structures containing superconducting ( s ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) materials became a focus of nanoelectronic research because of their relevance for spintronics applications as well as their potential impact on fundamental research @xcite .",
    "examples of successful developments include the discoveries of the @xmath1-junction @xcite in s / f / s josephson devices @xcite , of odd - frequency superconductivity @xcite in s / f heterostructures @xcite , and of the indirect josephson effect in s / half - metal / s junctions @xcite .",
    "other recent topics of interest include the study of majorana fermions at interfaces between superconductors and topological insulators @xcite and at edges in superfluid @xmath2he @xcite , and the appearance of pure spin supercurrents in topological superconductors @xcite , and in s / fi - f - fi devices as a result of geometric phases @xcite .",
    "the central subject in many of these studies is to understand how in the case of a superconductor coupled to a ferromagnetic material superconducting correlations penetrate into the ferromagnet , and how magnetic correlations penetrate into the superconductor @xcite . a powerful method to treat such problems",
    "is the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity developed by larkin and ovchinnikov and by eilenberger @xcite . within this theory @xcite the quasiparticle motion",
    "is treated on a classical level , whereas the particle - hole and the spin degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "the transport equation , which is a first order matrix differential equation for the quasiclassical propagator , must be supplemented by physical boundary conditions in order to obtain a unique solution .    whereas for the full microscopic green functions , the gorkov green functions @xcite , such boundary conditions can be readily formulated ( _ e.g. _ in terms of interface scattering matrices or in terms of transfer matrices ) ,",
    "this is a considerably more difficult task for quasiclassical green functions .",
    "in quasiclassical theory only the information about the envelope functions of bloch waves is retained , information about the phases of the waves is however missing .",
    "such envelope amplitudes can show jumps at interfaces , and one complex task is to calculate these jumps without knowing the full microscopic green functions near the interface .",
    "correspondingly , there is a long history of deriving boundary conditions for quasiclassical propagators , both for the eilenberger equations , and their diffusive limit , the usadel equations @xcite .    for ballistic transport , described by the eilenberger equations ,",
    "such boundary conditions were first formulated for spin - inactive interfaces in pioneering work by shelankov and by zaitsev @xcite , who showed the non - trivial fact that these jumps can be calculated using only the envelope functions .",
    "more general formulations were proposed subsequently @xcite , including a formulation in terms of interface scattering matrices by millis , rainer , and sauls @xcite .",
    "all these formulations were implicit in terms of non - linear matrix equations , and problems arose in numerical implementations due to spurious ( unphysical ) additional solutions which must be eliminated .",
    "progress was made with the help of shelankov s projector formalism @xcite , allowing for explicit formulations of boundary conditions in both equilibrium @xcite and non - equilibrium @xcite situations .",
    "further generalizations included spin - active interfaces , formulated for equilibrium @xcite and for non - equilibrium @xcite , and interfaces with diffusive scattering characteristics @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation in terms of quantum mechanical @xmath3-matrices @xcite proved also fruitful @xcite .",
    "the latest formulation , in terms of interface scattering matrices , is able to include non - equilibrium phenomena , interfaces and materials with weak or strong spin polarization , multi - band systems , as well as disordered systems @xcite .    for the diffusive limit",
    "a set of second order matrix differential equations has been derived by usadel @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ballistic case , where boundary conditions have been formulated for a wide set of applications , boundary conditions for the diffusive limit have been formulated so far only in certain limiting cases .",
    "the first formulation is by kupriyanov and lukichev , appropriate for the tunneling limit @xcite .",
    "this was generalized to arbitrary transmission by nazarov @xcite .",
    "a major advance was done by cottet in formulating boundary conditions for usadel equations appropriate for spin - polarized interfaces @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions are valid in the limit of small transmission , spin polarization , and spin - dependent scattering phase shifts ( this term is often used interchangeably with `` spin - mixing angles '' @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent formulations allowed for arbitrary spin polarization , although being restricted to small transmission and spin - dependent scattering @xcite . in ref . @xcite the authors present `` heuristically '' deduced boundary conditions , which coincide with the ones used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we not only present the full derivation of the specific boundary conditions used in refs .",
    "@xcite , but go further and give a full solution of the problem . with this , the long - standing problem of how to generalize nazarov s formula for arbitrary transmission probability @xcite to the case of spin - polarized systems with arbitrary spin polarization and arbitrary spin dependent scattering phases is solved .",
    "our boundary conditions are general enough to allow for non - equilibrium situations within keldysh formalism , as well as for complex interface spin textures .",
    "we reproduce as limiting cases all previously known formulations .",
    "the central quantity in quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite is the quasiclassical green function ( `` propagator '' ) @xmath4 .",
    "it describes quasiparticles with energy @xmath5 ( measured from the fermi level ) and momentum @xmath6 moving along classical trajectories with direction given by the fermi velocity @xmath7 in external potentials and self - consistent fields that are modulated by the slow spatial ( @xmath8 ) and time ( @xmath3 ) coordinates @xcite . the quasiclassical green function is a functional of self - energies @xmath9 , which in general include molecular fields , the superconducting order parameter @xmath10 , impurity scattering , and the external potentials .",

    "the components @xmath81 are matrices in particle - hole space as well as in scattering channel space ( _ e.g. _ scattering channels for ballistic transport would be parameterized by the fermi momenta of incoming and outgoing bloch waves ) .",
    "each element in 2@xmath112 particle hole space is in turn a matrix in combined spin and channel space , i.e. the number of incoming directions ( assumed to be equal to the number of outgoing directions due to particle conservation ) gives the dimension in channel space .",
    "the dimension in spin space is for spin - degenerate channels 2 and for spin - scalar channels 1 .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry is preserved , kramers degeneracy requires that each element of the scattering matrix has a 2x2 spin ( or more general : pseudo - spin ) structure ( as it connects doubly degenerate scattering channels on either side of the interface ) . for spin - polarized interfaces",
    "( _ e.g. _ ferromagnetic or with rashba spin - orbit coupling ) the scattering matrix is not spin - degenerate .",
    "however if the splitting of the spin - degeneracy is on the energy scale of the superconducting gap , it can be neglected within the precision of quasiclassical theory of superconductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lifting of the spin - degeneracy of energy bands is comparable to the fermi energy , the degeneracy of the scattering channels must be lifted as well in order to achieve consistency within quasiclassical theory .",

    "finally , the keldysh structure of these quantities is @xmath102 ( the additional hermitian conjugate in these equations is due to the fact that advanced green functions have the roles of `` incoming '' and `` outgoing '' momentum directions interchanged compared to retarded green functions ; this is similar to the additional hermitian conjugate appearing for hole components in particle - hole space ) .",
    "thus , the keldysh matrix structure for @xmath103 and @xmath104 is trivial ( proportional to unit matrix ) .",
    "the full normal - state scattering matrix is diagonal in particle - hole and in keldysh space , with reflection components @xmath105 and with transmission components @xmath106 note that @xmath107 connects incoming with outgoing bloch waves per definition ( as the scattering matrix does ) .",
    "we will formulate the theory such that all equations are valid on either side of the interface .",
    "this allows us to drop the indices @xmath108 for simplicity of notation by randomly choosing one side of the interface , and denoting quantities on the other side of the interface by underline .",
    "in particular , we will use @xmath109 and so forth [ see figure [ fig : notation](a ) ] . also , from eq .",

    ", we will employ a scattering matrix description , see figure [ fig : notation ] ( c ) , which , on the other hand , requires a similar elimination of drone amplitudes , this time being propagators mixing the two sides of the interface .",
    "however , for an impenetrable interface this latter problem does not arise , a fact we will exploit .    the strategy to derive the needed boundary conditions is to apply a three - step procedure . in the first step , the problem of an impenetrable interface with the auxiliary scattering matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ sv0 ] ) is solved on each side of the interface @xcite . for this step ,",
    "the ballistic solutions for the envelope functions for the gorkov propagators close to the interfaces should be expressed by the solutions @xmath44 of the usadel equation . in a second step , these ballistic solutions ( auxiliary propagators )",
    "are used in order to find the full ballistic solutions for finite transmission by utilizing a @xmath3-matrix technique @xcite . in the third , and final ,",
    "step the matrix current will be derived from the ballistic solutions , which then enters the boundary conditions for the usadel equations .",
    "we will present explicit solutions for all three steps , such that the procedure describes effectively boundary conditions for the solutions of usadel equations on either side of the interface .",
    "we use for the auxiliary propagators the notation @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where the upper index denotes the direction of the fermi velocity . _",
    "incoming _ momenta ( index @xmath115 ) are those with a fermi velocity pointing towards the interface , and _ outgoing _ momenta ( index @xmath116 ) are those with a fermi velocity pointing away from the interface .",
    "we solve first for the auxiliary ballistic propagators fulfilling the impenetrable boundary conditions @xmath117 implying matrix multiplication in the combined [ keldysh ] @xmath11 [ particle - hole ] @xmath11 [ combined scattering - channel and spin ] space .",
    "for diffusive banks , it is necessary to connect the ballistic propagators @xmath118 with the isotropic solutions of the usadel equation , @xmath119 .",
    "the ballistic propagators @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which characterize electronic correlations next to the scattering barrier , depend on the electronic momentum",
    ". however , in the diffusive case , impurity scattering leads to momentum isotropization away from the scattering barrier .",
    "this process occurs in isotropization zones with a thickness corresponding to a few times the inelastic mean free path of the materials , see figure [ fig : notation ] ( a ) .",
    "this scale is itself much smaller than the scale on which the isotropic diffusive green functions evolve in the bulk of the materials , in the framework of the usadel equations .",
    "indeed , the usadel equations involve a superconducting coherence length , which is typically much larger than the elastic mean free path .",
    "therefore , in order to describe disordered hybrid structures with usadel equations , suitable boundary conditions should be expressed in terms of the values of the isotropic green functions @xmath44 and @xmath122 right at the beginning of the isotropization zones .",

    "moreover , @xmath326 and @xmath327 are the normalized components of a possible misaligned barrier moment compared to the magnetization of the half - metal .",

    "the reason for this is that phase - shifts on the half - metallic side are irrelevant on the quasiclassical level , because they are spin - scalar ( only spin-@xmath298 particles have a finite density of states there ) .",
    "on the other hand , the phase - shifts @xmath335 on the superconducting side have two consequences : they are responsible for an @xmath336 spin - triplet component on that side of the interface ( where @xmath337 is the spin vector of the cooper pair ) , and they affect also transmission amplitudes . as a consequence , during transmission",
    "the quantization axis @xmath338 can be rotated into the @xmath339 spin triplet components which are allowed to exist in the half - metal spin - flip processes exist at the interface ( _ e.g. _ due to some misaligned interface moments ) .",

    "another important observation that can be made from the above expression is that a misaligned barrier moment effectively renormalizes the superconducting phase . using spherical coordinates",

    "we perform a singular value decomposition of the reflection and transmission matrices ( with dimensions @xmath367 for @xmath368 , @xmath369 for @xmath370 , @xmath371 for @xmath372 , and @xmath373 for @xmath374 ) @xmath375 here @xmath376 are unitary matrices , and the @xmath377 contain the real and non - negative singular values in the main diagonal and are zero otherwise .",
    "i.e. , @xmath378 and @xmath379 , @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "we assume that the singular values are sorted from smallest to largest in @xmath13 and @xmath382 , and from largest to smallest in @xmath352 and @xmath383 .",
    "we introduce the unitary matrices @xmath384 , @xmath385 @xmath386 , and @xmath387 . in terms of those , unitarity of the matrix @xmath76 requires that ( we denote for simplicity the unit matrices @xmath388 and @xmath389 with the same symbol 1 ; the dimension is clear from the context ) @xmath390 we see that @xmath391 and @xmath392 contain the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices on the right hand sides of the equations , which requires that these eigenvalues coincide with the values in the diagonal matrices @xmath393 , @xmath394 , @xmath395 , and @xmath396 , respectively .",
    "thus , with the sorting arrangement done above , the relations @xmath397 and @xmath398 hold .",

    "in particular , those matrices are block diagonal , with block sizes given by the degeneracy of the singular values in @xmath13 and @xmath382 , respectively .",
    "the remaining unitarity requirements , using the above findings , reduce to @xmath408 that means that for the blocks corresponding to non - zero reflection singular values the above two equations lead to the one condition @xmath409 .",
    "if there are no zero - reflection singular values then , remembering that @xmath404 commutes with @xmath13 and @xmath407 with @xmath382 , @xmath410 the blocks with zero - reflection singular values can be treated separately , and it is easily seen that the singular value decomposition of the scattering matrix has the general form @xmath411 with unitary matrices @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 . the decomposition is not unique .",
    "an important feature of the above representation is that the center matrix is hermitian .",
    "if we only require this property of the central part , but not necessarily diagonality of the @xmath373 matrix @xmath352 , then we can find an entire class of transformations that keep this property .",
    "we define @xmath416 with unitary matrices @xmath417 and @xmath418 .",
    "then @xmath419 where @xmath420 is now an @xmath371 matrix that is not necessarily diagonal anymore .",
    "consider now some special cases .",
    "first , we chose @xmath421 , @xmath422 .",
    "then @xmath423 with @xmath424 gives a polar decomposition of the reflection parts of the scattering matrix @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , @xmath425 , @xmath426 leads to @xmath427 with @xmath428 .",
    "we can also chose a decomposition in the form @xmath429 with @xmath430 , or other decompositions .",
    "these decompositions are unique when there are no zero - reflection singular values .",
    "this means , that under the conditions of no zero - reflection channels @xmath431 and @xmath432 are uniquely defined , as the matrices @xmath88 and @xmath420 are .",
    "the unique unitary matrices @xmath431 and @xmath433 are the surface scattering matrices @xmath86 and @xmath87 , eq . ( [ sv0 ] ) .",
    "we now turn to a useful parameterization of the transmission matrix @xmath88 .",
