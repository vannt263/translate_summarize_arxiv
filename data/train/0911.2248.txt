    "first , the transformation from early- to late - type requires a substantial reservoir of cold gas  the raw material for disk regrowth .",
    "historically , early - type galaxies were thought to be gas - poor @xcite .",
    "subsequent surveys , however , found that the ratio of gas mass to blue luminosity ( @xmath4 ) in early - type galaxies ranges from upper limits of @xmath5 to measured @xmath6 for large atomic gas reservoirs similar to those of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the 70% hi detection rate by @xcite suggests that atomic gas reservoirs are actually relatively common in field early - type galaxies .",
    "recent surveys also find a significant amount of molecular gas ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) in 2878% of early - type galaxies , depending on the survey @xcite .",
    "the large range in cold gas content hints that there may be distinct sub - populations of early - type galaxies  the conventional red and dead early types , and a population that is still accreting gas and forming stars .",
    "in addition to the _ presence _ of cold gas , the distribution of the gas is important in assessing the potential for disk regrowth .",
    "the existence of giant hi disks and rings @xcite , as predicted by simulations of mergers between gas - rich galaxies @xcite , makes it possible for stellar disks to form from already - present gas disks .",

    "kiloparsec - scale disks of regularly rotating molecular gas have also been found in the center of some early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "all these observations suggest that the gas disks around some , possibly most early - type galaxies have reached an equilibrium arrangement suitable for disk growth .",
    "while the presence of cold gas disks in an equilibrium configuration is necessary for stellar disk growth , it does not imply that star formation is actually occurring .",
    "a key question is whether e / s0 galaxies with such disks are currently evolving morphologically , and whether such galaxies constitute a significant fraction of the early - type galaxy population . to answer these questions , one must be able to distinguish between old , gas - poor early - type galaxies and those undergoing morphological transformation via disk regrowth .",

    "there is no ionized gas detection at all for ngc  3522 , so the hi profile for this galaxy indicates the presence of a previously unknown gas disk .    if the gas is in a stable orbit in the disk of a galaxy , it will not necessarily travel inwards towards star forming regions on a short timescale compared to the gas exhaustion time .",
    "depending on the density of the gas , the gas disk may or may not collapse to form stars .",
    "a dense disk of gas could dovetail nicely with either of our star formation scenarios above  it will collapse and form a stellar disk at the rate of the global sfr . if , however , the hi disk is too diffuse and spread out in an extended disk , the gas will continue in circular orbit in a dormant fashion unless it is perturbed by internal instabilities or events such as minor mergers or interactions .",

    "it is possible that some of our sub-@xmath35 blue - sequence e / s0s are in an active , post gas - infall star - forming phase but will eventually become passive early - type galaxies like those observed by @xcite .",
    "some of the differences between the sauron e / s0s and our blue - sequence e / s0s , however , likely arise from the differences between the two samples . while there are some e / s0s below the bimodality mass @xmath139 in the sauron sample , these are in the minority",
    "; in contrast , the disk - building sub - population of blue - sequence e / s0s becomes numerically important only below this mass , and more notably below the threshold mass at @xmath140 ( ) .",
    "it is also possible that the accretion of fresh gas from external sources , as discussed in  [ section.simulations ] , will reignite star formation in some red - sequence e / s0s ( in both samples ) and continue building disks (; @xcite ) .",
    "the high frequency of blue - sequence e / s0s below the threshold mass ( @xmath395% of the general galaxy population and @xmath3925% of e / s0s , ) would be difficult to explain by quenching mergers alone , but could be explained if these systems star - forming phase is either long or episodic .",
    "@xcite recently identified a population of e / s0s that reside on the blue sequence in color vs. stellar mass space , where spiral galaxies typically reside .",
    "blue - sequence e / s0s increase in numbers below the bimodality mass ( @xmath141 ) and especially below the gas richness threshold ( @xmath395@xmath142 ) .",
    "these sub-@xmath35 blue - sequence e / s0s are characterized by fairly regular morphology , and many appear to be rebuilding disks .",
    "blue - sequence e / s0s also fall between red - sequence e / s0s and spirals in the @xmath9-radius and @xmath9-@xmath10 relations , suggesting that they may be a transitional population .    in this paper",
    ", we examined the atomic gas content of blue - sequence e / s0s below @xmath39@xmath35 to determine whether they have large enough gas reservoirs to transform to later - type morphology . in a representative sample drawn from the nearby field galaxy survey",
    ", we find that blue - sequence e / s0s have substantial atomic gas masses in the range of @xmath7@xmath143 , comparable to the gas masses of spiral and irregular galaxies in the same stellar mass range . blue- and red - sequence e / s0s have distinctly different atomic gas - to - stellar mass ratios , with most blue - sequence e / s0s in the range of 0.11.0 and most red - sequence e / s0s @xmath1440.1 .",
    "this suggests significantly greater potential for morphological transformation in blue - sequence e / s0s than red - sequence e / s0s .    combining these atomic gas masses with current rates of star formation",
    ", we find that many of the sub-@xmath35 blue - sequence e / s0s can form new stars in the range of 1060@xmath145 of their current stellar masses within 3 gyr , in both constant ( i.e. , allowing gas infall ) and exponentially declining ( i.e. , closed box ) star formation scenarios , provided that the atomic gas reservoir is available for star formation . in the constant star formation scenario",
    ", we find that about half of the sub-@xmath35 blue - sequence e / s0 systems will exhaust their gas reservoirs in @xmath33 gyr if no fresh gas infall is permitted .    because of the lack of spatial resolution in our hi data",
    ", we can not say for certain that the gas is readily available for star formation .",
    "we find evidence , however , which indicate that fresh gas may be brought inwards and made available for star formation on timescales shorter than the gas exhaustion timescale .",
    "we estimate the dynamical timescale for infall of extra - planar gas to be on average @xmath1441 gyr , shorter than the gas exhaustion time for most of our galaxies . the frequency of inflow for gas trapped in diffuse disks may be dominated by the rate of minor mergers / interactions , which simulations find to occur every 1.4 gyr or less for progenitor mass ratios of 1:100 or smaller @xcite . as evidence of such events",
    ", we find that sub-@xmath35 blue - sequence e / s0s are more often blue - centered than the general galaxy population , where blue - centeredness is measured relative to the typical color gradient of galaxies at a given luminosity .",
    "@xcite find blue - centeredness to correlate with morphological peculiarities and companions , which supports the externally triggered gas inflow scenario . for blue - sequence e / s0s",
    ", we find a relationship between blue - centeredness and variations in specific star formation rates relative to typical reference values , suggesting that such inflows may be episodic and trigger bursts of star formation . in summary",
    ", this work clearly confirms that blue - sequence e / s0s have both the gas reservoirs and the potential for sustained star formation necessary for significant disk growth , consistent with evolution toward later - type morphology if the spatial distribution of the gas is extended . while our sample of 27 blue- and red - sequence e / s0s is sufficient for the analysis presented in this paper , it is important to extend our work to a larger sample of sub-@xmath35 e / s0s for more robust statistics . the multi - wavelength resolve survey underway",
    "@xcite would be an ideal data set for such a study .",
    "active follow - up includes obtaining iram co(10 ) and co(21 ) spectra to quantify the molecular gas content in these galaxies , which may be a large fraction of the gas mass content and further extend the potential for morphological transformation in blue - sequence e / s0s .",
    "we are also obtaining vla hi and carma co(10 ) maps to resolve the distribution of the atomic and molecular gas in blue - sequence e / s0s .",
    "hi maps will allow us to look for extended gas disks , small companions , and/or signs of interactions .",

    "<S> recent work has identified a population of low - redshift e / s0 galaxies that lie on the blue sequence in color vs. stellar mass parameter space , where spiral galaxies typically reside . while high - mass blue - sequence e / s0s often resemble young merger or interaction remnants likely to fade to the red sequence , we focus on blue - sequence e / s0s with lower stellar masses ( @xmath0 a few @xmath1 ) , which are characterized by fairly regular morphologies and low - density field environments where fresh gas infall is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this population may provide an evolutionary link between early - type galaxies and spirals through disk regrowth . focusing on atomic gas reservoirs , we present new gbt hi data for 27 e / s0s on both sequences as well as a complete tabulation of archival hi data for other galaxies in the nearby field galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> normalized to stellar mass , the atomic gas masses for 12 of the 14 blue - sequence e / s0s range from 0.1 to @xmath21.0 , demonstrating that morphological transformation is possible if the detected gas can be converted into stars . </S>",
    "<S> these gas - to - stellar mass ratios are comparable to those of spiral and irregular galaxies and have a similar dependence on stellar mass . assuming that the hi is accessible for star formation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that many of our blue - sequence e / s0s can increase in stellar mass by 1060% in 3 gyr in both of two limiting scenarios , exponentially declining star formation ( i.e. , closed box ) and constant star formation ( i.e. , allowing gas infall ) . in a constant star formation scenario , </S>",
    "<S> about half of the blue - sequence e / s0s require fresh gas infall on a timescale of @xmath33 gyr to avoid exhausting their atomic gas reservoirs and evolving to the red sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that star formation in these galaxies is bursty and likely involves externally triggered gas inflows . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that most blue - sequence e / s0s are indeed capable of substantial stellar disk growth on relatively short timescales . </S>"
