    "when two balls are dropped together , both vertically aligned and hitting the ground at the same time , an interesting rebound effect is obtained .",
    "if the smaller ball is above , it may rise surprisingly high into the air .",
    "this effect may still be enhanced if one drops a chain of balls , ordered by their relative weight , the lightest ball at the top .",
    "this system was already discussed in pedagogical articles more than 30 years ago , assuming perfect and independent elastic collisions between each pair of balls @xcite .",
    "it was considered an attractive and ideal system to study elastic collisions . however",
    ", if the balls are dropped together , all collisions will happen at the same time . because they are not instantaneous",
    ", the final velocity distribution of the balls will be dependent on the particular interactions between them , even in those cases where the interactions are elastic , _ i.e. _ , with no loss of energy . in their beautiful article @xcite , the class of w. g. harter considered at some point non - instantaneous collisions . to study them",
    ", they introduced a simple quasi - linear model , which could be valid if we think not of spheres but of uni - dimensional springs . the dynamical differential equations were solved using an analog computer program .",
    "however , they concluded that the quasi - linear model did not agree with their experimental results , and they proposed a phenomenological non linear model . the interaction field",
    "was then obtained directly from empirical data , by dropping a ball onto a painted flat metal surface from varying heights . in this way",
    "the interaction could be plotted as a function of the spot size , and eventually as a function of the depression of the ball . although the strategy to obtain the non linear interaction was remarkable , the discussion that followed",
    "was not sufficiently developed .",
    "in fact , from the theoretical point of view and as a first approximation , the analysis of the non - instantaneous multiple collisions effect should take into account the interaction between two elastic spheres obeying hooke s law , which is always valid for sufficiently small deformations .",
    "this problem is known in the literature as the hertz contact @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "a system involving multiple collisions between two different elastic spheres , one on top of the other , with the same initial velocity , hitting a planar hard horizontal wall is considered . in section  ii , the results obtained for instantaneous elastic collisions are briefly reviewed .",
    "next , the hertz contact is introduced in the mathematical model of the system . at the end ,",
    "the results of this theoretical analysis are presented .",
    "the main differences between independent and non - instantaneous collisions are outlined and discussed .",
    "consider a system with two elastic spheres , one on top of the other , falling with the same velocity @xmath0 , colliding with the ground , as represented in fig .  1",
    ".    = 20.5pc    assume a very small gap between the spheres , such that all collisions can be treated individually .",
    "first , the lower sphere hits the rigid wall and returns with the same velocity @xmath0 .",
    "next , the spheres collide elastically .",
    "the final velocities @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( of lower and upper sphere respectively ) can be calculated through momentum and energy conservation principle , and are independent of the particular interaction .",
    "if @xmath3 is the spheres mass ratio , we can write : @xmath4 where the positive sign corresponds to the upward orientation .",
    "the upper sphere may rebound with a velocity up to three times greater than its initial one , for a vanishingly small mass ratio .",
    "that is , if its mass is much smaller than the mass of the lower sphere .",
    "in fact , the rebound may be enhanced if we add to this system extra spheres , all falling with the same initial velocity @xmath0 . to study this effect ,",
    "consider first the elastic collision between two spheres with a mass ratio @xmath5 but with different initial velocities .",
    "the upper sphere still moves with a downward velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the lower sphere has now previously collide with another sphere and moves upward with a velocity @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the final velocities are now given by : @xmath8 naturally , equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) are recovered if @xmath9 . for a system with @xmath10 spheres ,",
    "the upper one may achieve a final velocity of @xmath11 , if all mass ratios are vanishingly small .    another interesting limit to this system , for a certain distribution of mass ratios ,",
    "concerns the case for which all lower spheres stop , and only the upper one rises into the air .",
    "in this situation , all initial energy was transmitted to only one sphere . in the simple system composed of only two spheres ,",
    "the lower one has null final velocity for @xmath12 , whereas the upper sphere rebounds to reach twice its initial velocity .",
    "however , if the spheres fall together , the assumption of independent collisions may no longer be accurate .",
    "for the system represented in fig .  1 , both collisions - of the lower sphere with the ground and of the two spheres - will happen at the same time . to obtain the final velocities , after the spheres separation , it is important to know the particular interaction between them . in the following subsections ,",
    "one presents the simplest possible interaction : it will be assumed that all solids respect hooke s law of elasticity , valid for sufficiently small deformations .",
    "the dynamical equations for this model will then be established and solved .",
    "the theory of the elastic contact between solids was first studied by h. hertz , and it can be followed in detail in ref .  @xcite . for two isotropic and homogeneous elastic spheres , with radius of curvature respectively of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see fig .  2 ) , the elastic potential energy @xmath15 depends on the combined deformation @xmath16 as : @xmath17 where the reduced radius @xmath18 and the reduced elastic constant @xmath19 is dependent on the young moduli @xmath20 , @xmath21 and on the poisson coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "it is given by : @xmath24 the young modulus increases with the solid rigidity , whereas the poisson coefficient is typically slightly smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "= 20.5pc    the elastic energy  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is valid for a static deformation .",
    "nevertheless , it can be considered a good approximation for the situation studied in this article if the velocity @xmath0 is much smaller than the sound velocities of the solids involved .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this approximation fits well the experimental potential energy obtained by the class of w. g. harter  @xcite , in the first regime of small ball depressions . for large depressions ,",
    "the energy increased with a greater power of @xmath16 , which is in agreement with the fact that hooke s elastic regime only take into account the first terms of the elastic energy power expansion on the deformation .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the maximum height of deformation and the contact time of two colliding spheres .",
    "suppose @xmath26 is the relative velocity of the spheres before the collision , and @xmath27 their reduced mass .",
    "then , the energy conservation principle reads : @xmath28 the maximum height of deformation occurs when the relative velocity is zero and can be written : @xmath29 the collision time corresponds to the time in which the deformation goes from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and back to @xmath30 again .",
    "it is given by : @xmath32 these are the relevant length and time for elastic collision problems , and they will be useful to write down dimensionless dynamical equations .      for the system represented in fig .  1 ,",
    "the total potential energy is given by the sum : @xmath33 where the first term takes into account the interaction between the first sphere and the rigid ground , with infinite young modulus and radius of curvature , and the second term is the interaction between both spheres .",
    "the deformations depend on the positions @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the centers of the spheres ( the ground defining the reference position ) : @xmath36 the function @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "the equations of motion @xmath40 , ( @xmath41 ) , will simply be written : @xmath42 if one introduces natural units , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are associated with the maximum height of depression and the time of contact between the ground and the first sphere , it is possible to define dimensionless variables .",
    "the equations of motion may be written in a simpler form : @xmath45 they only depend on two parameters , @xmath46 note that @xmath47 is defined as a ratio of the reduced elastic constants and radius .",
    "if the infinite rigidity of the planar wall is taken into account , we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for this system ,",
    "one concludes that @xmath50 .",
    "the set of differential dynamical equations ( [ eq:15 ] ) and ( [ eq:16 ] ) was solved numerically using a simple and standard euler method , for different values of the parameters .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows several solutions found for the positions @xmath34 and @xmath35 as functions of time , starting when the two spheres initially in contact hit the ground with the same velocity @xmath0 , until they separate with constant final velocities @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the axis have arbitrary units .",
    "the solutions were calculated for spheres with the same young modulus and density , but four different mass ratios @xmath51 ( wich were obtained choosing appropriate sphere radii ) .",
    "= 20.5pc    surprisingly , for a very small mass ratio , the spheres have almost the same velocity @xmath52 after the rebound .",
    "this situation contrasts with the results obtained considering independent collisions , for which the maximum velocity gain would be expected .",
    "in fact , if the mass ratio @xmath5 is negligible , it is possible to see from eq .",
    "[ eq:16 ] that the deformation @xmath53 will also be very small , exherting almost no influence in the motion of the lower sphere ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "the latter sphere rebounds with the wall and returns with velocity @xmath54 . since @xmath55",
    ", it may be concluded that @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 , which means that both spheres stick together during the collision as if they were one whole body @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that for mass ratios greater than one ( in the case of the figure with @xmath58 ) the three body collision gets more complex , with the bottom sphere making several rebounds between the ground and the other sphere .",
    "it is important to mention that the final velocities do not depend on the amplitude of the spheres deformations during the collisions . if both spheres were more rigid , but keeping the same ratio @xmath47 , the deformations could be very small , and still the final velocities would be equal to the ones represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the bold lines represent the final velocity distributions @xmath1 and @xmath2 as functions of @xmath59 , for different values of @xmath60 .",
    "the thin lines show the results of equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , considering independent collisions .",
    "= 20.5pc    the independent collisions results are recovered for small values of the ratio @xmath61 , and consequently for small @xmath47 .",
    "this is particularly true for the final velocity distribution of the lower sphere @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath62 , it is possible to see from eq .",
    "[ eq:15 ] that in a first moment , the motion of the lower sphere will depend mainly on its interaction with the wall  the deformation @xmath53 between both spheres will have a negligible contribution when it is compared with the deformation @xmath63 between the lower sphere and the wall . however , if the collision time between both spheres is large enough ( as it is shown in eq .",
    "[ eq:9 ] , the collision time increases for small @xmath47 ) , after the lower sphere - wall interaction , the terms containing the deformation @xmath53 will be the only ones present in the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , the collisions can be considered as almost independent and subsequential . nevertheless ,",
    "as the final velocity @xmath2 is concerned , the convergence does not occur for all values of @xmath5 : it is possible to see in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( @xmath64 ) that the final speed @xmath65 as the mass ratio @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath61 ( or @xmath47 ) increases , small changes can be seen in the final velocity distributions , and the independent collisions approximation is no longer appliable .",
    "these changes are limited because the infinite rigidity assumption requires @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , the velocity distributions for @xmath67 is not very different from the one represented for @xmath68    the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] represent the rebound maximum speed @xmath69 as a function of @xmath50 . on the right , the mass ratio @xmath70 corresponding to the maximum rebound speed",
    "is also plotted .",

    "if @xmath72 , this sphere rebounds twice off the ground , before it reaches the final velocity represented in the figure .",
    "if the ratio between the young moduli increases , the discontinuity changes first its position ( @xmath73 ) , and eventually it disappears ( @xmath74 and larger values ) .",
    "however , these discontinuities will happen again for larger values of @xmath5 , as the lower sphere rebounds more and more in between the ground and the upper sphere .",
    "this curious feature can be seen in fig .",

    "in this article , the influence of the hertz contact on multiple chain collisions was studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the independent collisions approximation is no longer valid for small values of the mass ratio @xmath5 and large values of the rigidity ratio @xmath47 .    to understand the results obtained here , it is important to consider the typical two - body times of collision ( see eq .",

    "the first collision occurs almost instantaneously , and subsequently , the two spheres collide .",
    "thus , the results obtained considering this limit approach the independent collisions results .      despite its complexity , the final velocity distributions @xmath1 and @xmath2 approach each other for large @xmath47 and small @xmath5 . in this limit ( @xmath66 ) , as it was prooved through the analysis of the equations of motion , both spheres behave as if they belonged to the same body , changing their velocities together as they interact with the ground . at the end ,",
