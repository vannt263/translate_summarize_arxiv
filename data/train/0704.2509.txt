    "is well known that multiple antenna systems can offer increased data rate and reliability as compared to single antenna systems when the fading coefficients are known at the receiver . however , in practice , learning the fading coefficients becomes increasingly difficult as either the fading rate or number of transmit antennas increases .",
    "motivated by this problem , in @xcite , a transmission strategy called differential unitary space - time modulation was introduced for the noncoherent mimo channel where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has knowledge of the channel .",
    "essentially , using this strategy the problem of noncoherent space - time coding becomes similar to the problem of coherent space - time coding with the additional requirement for unitary codewords . since the introduction of differential space - time codes , several works including @xcite-@xcite and the references in them have focused along different directions to obtain full diversity differential space - time codes ( dstcs ) .",
    "most of these previous works obtained full diversity dstcs by neglecting the issue of encoding and decoding complexity which are crucial for practically realizing high rate systems .",
    "though few works @xcite-@xcite have addressed this issue partially , there seems to be no systematic construction of high rate full diversity dstcs guided by the requirement for low encoding and decoding complexity .",
    "the differential encoding / decoding setup utilized in @xcite is more general than the differential unitary space - time modulation scheme originally proposed in @xcite in the sense that those originally proposed demand all the codeword matrices to be unitary whereas the generalized one asks for only scaled unitary codeword matrices . in this paper , we design signal sets for the rate-1 linear designs proposed in @xcite thus leading to four - group decodable differential scaled - unitary stbcs with full - diversity .",
    "the main contributions can be summarized as follows :    * the notion of @xmath0-group encodable linear space - time codes is formally introduced and the inter - relationship with @xmath0-group decodable linear space - time codes is made clear . * explicit construction of fully diverse signal sets leading to scaled - unitary codewords is provided for the designs in @xcite for arbitrary transmission rate and dimensions being a power of two .",
    "previous algebraic approaches @xcite involved intensive computations which was code specific and did not permit an explicit closed form solution for arbitrary rate and dimension . * the resulting codes trade off rate and decoding complexity without sacrificing either of them completely .",
    "previous works either sacrifice decoding complexity for higher rate or sacrifice rate for lower decoding complexity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] introduces the notion of @xmath0-group encodable and @xmath0-group decodable linear stbcs and describes its application and significance in the differential encoding / decoding setup . in section [ sec3 ] , the rate one complex symbols per channel use , @xmath1-group decodable design of @xcite is briefly described .",
    "the issues involved in the construction of fully diverse signal sets for these designs so that they are usable as differential scaled - unitary stbcs with full - diversity are highlighted in section [ sec4 ] and one particular class of fully diverse signal sets is explicitly constructed for arbitrary transmission rate in bits / sec / hz . section [ sec5 ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we first introduce the notion of @xmath0-group encodable and @xmath0-group decodable linear stbcs and explain their significance in the context of differential stbcs .",
    "a linear design @xmath2 in @xmath3 real indeterminates or variables @xmath4 is a @xmath5 matrix with entries being a complex linear combination of the variables .",
    "it can be written as @xmath6 where , @xmath7 are called the _ weight matrices_.",
    "a linear stbc @xmath8 is a finite set of @xmath5 complex matrices which can be obtained by taking a linear design @xmath9 and specifying a signal set @xmath10 from which the information vector @xmath11^t$ ] take values from , with the additional condition that @xmath12 .",
    "a linear stbc @xmath13 is said to be @xmath0-group encodable ( or @xmath14 real symbol encodable or @xmath15 complex symbol encodable ) if @xmath0 divides @xmath3 and if @xmath16 where each @xmath17 .",
    "the popular alamouti design along with square qam constellation for each complex symbol is a @xmath1-group encodable linear stbc , since square qam constellation can be realized as a cartesian product of two pam constellations .",
    "consider a mimo channel with @xmath18 transmit antennas and @xmath19 receive antennas .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the @xmath21 channel matrix at time frame channel uses . ]",
    "let @xmath23 be the transmitted @xmath24 matrix at time frame @xmath22 .",
    "then the received matrix at time frame @xmath22 is @xmath25 where , @xmath26 is the additive white gaussian noise at the receiver at time frame @xmath22 .",
    "the differential encoding is performed as follows .",
    "a known unitary codeword @xmath27 is first transmitted to start with .",
    "the transmitted matrix at time frame @xmath22 is then @xmath28 where , @xmath29 is the codeword containing the information at time frame @xmath22 which satisfies @xmath30 . in other words , we restrict the code @xmath8 to contain only scaled unitary matrices . note that the differential stbc schemes in @xcite further restrict all the codewords to be unitary matrices to ensure that the power does not tend to zero or infinity .",
    "however , even if we allow scaled unitary codewords it is possible to ensure that the average transmit power constraint say @xmath31 is met by requiring that @xmath32    for such systems , a near - optimal differential decoder has been utilized in @xcite which detects @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 where , @xmath35 can be estimated from the previous decision @xmath36 note that the channel matrix @xmath37 is not required for decoding @xmath33 .",
    "further , it has been shown @xcite that the code design criteria for full diversity and coding gain is same as in the case of unitary differential stbcs , i.e , the well known rank and determinant criteria .",
    "also note that in general @xmath38 computations are required to perform the decoding .    to reduce the encoding complexity our strategy would be to choose @xmath8 to be a linear stbc .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "now the higher the value of @xmath0 , the lower the encoding complexity .",
    "moreover , decoding @xmath33 is same as decoding the information symbol vector @xmath11^t$ ] . towards obtaining the conditions for low decoding complexity",
    ", we shall first briefly introduce the notion of @xmath0-group decodable linear stbcs @xcite .",
    "though , @xmath0-group decodable stbcs have been studied in previous works @xcite , the strong inter - relationship between encoding complexity and decoding complexity was not highlighted and it was implicitly assumed . further the notion of encoding complexity was not put in formal terms .",
    "suppose we partition the set of weight matrices of @xmath39 into @xmath0-groups , the @xmath40-th group containing @xmath41 matrices and also the information symbol vector as , @xmath42^t$ ] where , @xmath43^t$ ] , then @xmath39 can be written as , @xmath44    minimizing @xmath45 is in general not same as minimizing @xmath46 for each @xmath47 individually .",
    "however if it so happens , then the decoding complexity is reduced by a large amount . note that it is not possible to compute unless the code is @xmath0-group encodable also .",
    "a linear stbc @xmath13 is said to be @xmath0-group decodable ( or @xmath14 real symbol decodable or @xmath15 complex symbol decodable ) if it is @xmath0-group encodable and if its decoding metric in can be simplified as in .",
    "a linear stbc @xmath13 is @xmath0-group decodable if the following two conditions are satisfied .    1",
    ".   @xmath8 is @xmath0-group encodable 2 .",
    "if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the weight matrices of two variables belonging to two different groups , then they should satisfy the following equation @xmath50    proof is straightforward and identical to the proof in @xcite .    in the light of the definition of encoding complexity , for the cayley codes @xcite",
    "if we look at the matrices obtained after applying cayley transform , the encoding complexity is exponential . in this paper",
    ", we have taken the viewpoint of defining encoding complexity of the matrices which are used to perform differential encoding .",
    "moreover , cayley transform requires appropriate computation of matrix inverses .",
    "the differential stbc design problem is to design a linear stbc @xmath13 such that    1 .",
    "all codewords are scaled unitary matrices and the average scale factor should meet the power constraint .",
    "2 .   @xmath3 and @xmath0 are maximized 3 .",
    "@xmath51 is maximized .",
    "we now briefly highlight the various issues involved in satisfying the above stated requirements by illustrating with some examples .",
    "let us consider the golden code for @xmath52 transmit antennas .",
    "it has @xmath53 real variables . for the coherent mimo channel , the signal set used is qam for each complex variable .",
    "hence this code is a @xmath53-group encodable ( since qam is a cartesian product of two pam signal sets ) and @xmath54-group decodable linear stbc and thus has low encoding complexity .",
    "however , if we now impose the requirement for scaled unitary codewords , then we will have to solve for signal sets which will yield scaled unitary codewords inside the division algebra .",
    "although this approach can potentially offer excellent coding gain , it may amount to entangling all the @xmath53-real variables which will make the code @xmath54-group encodable and @xmath54-group decodable .",
    "this approach was recently attempted in @xcite .",
    "[ eg_alamouti ] let us take the example of the alamouti code for @xmath52 transmit antennas .",
    "it has @xmath1 real variables . now",
    "if we choose the signal set to be psk ( points on the unit circle ) for every complex variable , then all the codewords become unitary matrices , since the alamouti code is an orthogonal design . hence",
    "such a code is @xmath52-group encodable as well as @xmath52-group decodable .",
    "further this code also provides full diversity . however , note that if we take square qam to be the signal set for each complex variable , then we get a @xmath1-group encodable ( square qam is a cartesian product of two pam signal sets ) and @xmath1-group decodable full diversity code , but now the codewords are scaled unitary matrices as opposed to unitary matrices .",
    "thus relaxing the codewords to be scaled unitary matrices allows us to lower the encoding and decoding complexity .",
    "the above two examples show that _ the choice of signal sets is crucial in obtaining low encoding and decoding complexity_.",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the construction of a rate - one linear which satisfies the conditions for @xmath1-group decadability .",
    "this construction was first proposed in @xcite .    given a @xmath5 linear design @xmath55 in @xmath3 complex variables",
    "@xmath56 , one can construct a new @xmath57 linear design @xmath58 as follows .",
    "@xmath59\\ ] ] where , the linear design @xmath60 is identical to the linear design @xmath55 except that it is in different variables @xmath61 .",
    "we call this construction as the abba construction. this construction was first introduced in @xcite , albeit only for alamouti design .    given a @xmath5 linear design @xmath55 in @xmath3 complex variables @xmath56",
    ", one can also construct a new @xmath57 linear design @xmath62 as follows .",
    "@xmath63\\ ] ] where , the linear design @xmath60 is identical to the linear design @xmath55 except that it is in different complex variables @xmath61 .",
    "we call this construction as the doubling construction. this construction has also been reported in @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to describe our iterative construction . for @xmath64",
    ", we have the alamouti design .",
    "[ cons_design]@xcite for @xmath65 , consider the linear design @xmath66.$ ] now , to obtain a linear design for @xmath67 , we follow the steps given below .",
    "step 1 : starting with @xmath68 , keep applying abba construction iteratively on it till a @xmath69 linear design @xmath70 is obtained . step 2 : then apply doubling construction on @xmath70 to obtain the required design .",
    "a detailed description of these and the proof that the designs given by the above construction are @xmath1-group decodable is given in @xcite .",
    "now , the design for @xmath1 transmit antennas according to construction [ cons_design ] is @xmath71\\ ] ] and the design for larger number of transmit antennas can also be easily constructed .",
    "in this section , we construct fully diverse signal sets for the linear designs constructed in the previous subsection .",
    "the signal sets should be designed in such a way that the following important requirements are met by the code simultaneously .    1",
    ".   scaled unitary codewords meeting power constraint 2 .",
    "four - group encodable and four - group decodable 3 .",
    "difference of any two different codewords should be full rank ( full diversity )    we shall first illustrate the procedure for construction of signal sets for @xmath1 transmit antennas and then generalize the ideas for any @xmath72 transmit antennas . for the design for @xmath1 transmit antennas we study @xmath73\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 to find out the conditions on the signal sets under which the codewords are scaled unitary matrices .",
    "we see that the signal set should be chosen such that the following condition is satisfied for all the signal points : @xmath76 however , we should be careful to not to disturb @xmath1-group encodability in the process .",
    "hence we first identify the grouping of the variables . according to the construction of @xcite , the four groups are as follows .",
    "@xmath77 the chosen signal sets should be in such a way that there are no joint constraints on variables from different groups .",
    "if that happens , then the code will no longer be @xmath1-group encodable and @xmath1-group decodable .",
    "putting together all the requirements for scaled unitary codewords , we have @xmath78 the above equations can be satisfied without disturbing @xmath1-group encodability as shown below .",
    "@xmath79 where , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are positive real constants . then",
    ", the average power constraint requirement can be met by satisfying the conditions @xmath82    where , without loss of generality we have considered the average power on a symbol to equal @xmath54 .",
    "solutions to are simply points on a hyperbola .",
    "thus a common set of solutions of and can be obtained by taking points on the intersection of circles and hyperbolas .",
    "but we have a third requirement of full diversity which has to be met . for this",
    "we use the structure of the constructed designs .",
    "the constructed designs have the form @xmath83.$ ] it can be shown @xcite that @xmath84 thus we can guarantee full diversity by ensuring that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "just like before , we should be careful not to disturb @xmath1-group encodability in the process .",
    "we take care of that requirement also by satisfying the following conditions : @xmath87 the solution satisfying all the three conditions , and can be found simply by finding the intersection of points on the unit circle @xmath88 with a hyperbola @xmath89 , where @xmath90 on the two dimensional @xmath91 plane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_signal2dimstruct ] .        observe that the hyperbola intersects the circle at four different points .",
    "but the full diversity criterion demands that @xmath92 . after enforcing this condition ,",
    "only two points survive out of the four points",
    ". they can be either the set of points marked * a * or the set of points marked * b * in fig .",
    "[ fig_signal2dimstruct ] .",
    "thus we have obtained a signal set containing @xmath52 points .",
    "if we need more points , we can then invoke the fact that scaled unitary codewords are sufficient .",
    "we can draw more circles ( centered at origin ) with radii such that the average power constraint is met and then find those points intersecting with the hyperbola . more precisely , to get @xmath93 points , draw @xmath94 concentric circles with increasing radii @xmath95 such that @xmath96 then find those points intersecting with the hyperbola @xmath89 where , @xmath97 is a positive number less than @xmath98 . in this manner",
