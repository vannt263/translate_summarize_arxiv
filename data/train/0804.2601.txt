    "probably one of the most astonishing and relevant discoveries of the last decade in theoretical physics was the ads / cft ( anti de sitter / conformal field theory ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this powerful tool makes it possible to get deep insights into the dynamics of strongly interacting gauge theories with a gravity dual in the limit @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of colors and @xmath5 is the t hooft coupling @xmath6 . according to this holographic correspondence it is possible to relate some black - brane configurations in higher dimensions to certain four dimensional conformal quantum field theories ( cft ) at finite temperature .",
    "the thermodynamic properties such as temperature and entropy of the cft can thus be obtained from the corresponding bekenstein definitions for the black - brane . moreover , not only the thermodynamics but also the hydrodynamic behavior of the black - brane horizon can be identified with the cft hydrodynamics . in particular , by using the ads / cft correspondence it has been possible to compute , for a very large class of four dimensional theories with gravity duals , the ratio @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the shear viscosity and @xmath9 is the entropy density , dimensionally both scaling as @xmath10 $ ] in natural units . from the cft point of view , the standard relativistic hydrodynamic equations @xcite , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , the energy momentum tensor , can be understood as the effective theory describing the dynamics of the cft at large distance and time @xcite . following the philosophy of the effective theories it is possible to expand the energy - momentum tensor in powers of the space - time derivatives . to zeroth order",
    "we get the well known ideal fluid equations .",
    "dissipative processes require going to the next order where diffusion coefficients such as the shear viscosity @xmath8 , the bulk viscosity @xmath13 and the heat conductivity @xmath14 appear together with other possible diffusion coefficients @xmath15 . from the linearized equation of motion in momentum space at this order one can get the dispersion relation of the mechanical excitations , which are two transverse modes with @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the energy density and @xmath18 the pressure ) and one sound mode : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of sound .",
    "the imaginary part in the right hand - side entails a damping of the corresponding mode , and its size therefore measures the ability of the fluid to dissipate perturbations .",
    "since for vanishing chemical potential we have the thermodynamic equation @xmath21 , @xmath0 governs the right hand side and is a good way to characterize the intrinsic ability of a system to relax towards equilibrium @xcite , especially for @xmath22 which is , in particular , the case of cft .",
    "how is it possible to compute the diffusion coefficients ?",
    "the traditional way is by using kinetic theory , more precisely the boltzmann equation or its quantum version , the uehling - uhlenbenck equation , written in terms of the elastic cross - sections , and which can be solved by the chapman - enskog method to first order in the perturbation out of equilibrium @xcite . when can we then apply these kinetic theory methods ?",
    "the main condition is that the mean free path must be much larger than the interaction distance , which typically occurs for low density , weakly interacting , systems",
    ". then one can find the well known and somewhat counter - intuitive result establishing that the greater the interaction , the lesser the viscosity .    from a more modern prospective ,",
    "it is possible to use the so called kubo formulae . the corresponding shear viscosity ( for short , viscosity in the following )",
    "can be obtained by analyzing linear response theory and coupling the fluid to gravity by using an appropriate lightly curved space - time background .",
    "then one can find : @xmath24\\rangle   \\right ) \\ .\\ ] ] this equation can be used to compute @xmath0 in the context of the ads / cft correspondence . in order to do that one starts from a cft with gravity dual .",
    "for example for @xmath25 super yang - mills one can consider the metric in five - dimensional ads @xmath26 + \\frac{r^2}{r^2(1-r_0 ^ 4/r^4)}dr^2 \\ .\\ ] ] the dual theory is a cft at temperature @xmath27 equal to the hawking temperature of the black - brane and bekenstein entropy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ( hyper)area of the black - brane horizon located at @xmath30 .",
    "now , following klebanov @xcite , consider a graviton polarized in the x - y direction and propagating perpendiculary to the brane .",
    "the absorption cross - section of the graviton by the brane measures , in the dual cft , the imaginary part of the retarded green s function of the operator coupled to the metric i.e. the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "then it is possible to find : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the graviton absorption cross - section at zero energy .",
    "this cross - section can be computed classically by using linerized einstein equations and it turns out equal to the horizon area so that one finally arrives to the formula shown in eq.([thebound ] ) .",
    "quite remarkable is that the result then does not depend on the particular form of the metric .",
    "it is the same for dp , m2 and m5 branes .",
    "basically the reason is the universality of the graviton absorption cross - section .",
    "from the result for the @xmath0 ratio for theories with a gravity dual , kovtun , son and starinets ( kss ) proposed the conjecture that , for a very wide class of systems , including those that can be described by a sensible ( i.e. ultraviolet complete ) quantum field theory , the above ratio has the lower bound : @xmath33 there are several pieces of evidence supporting this conjecture .",
    "the first one is based on the heisenbeg uncertainty principle and kinetic theory .",
    "the viscosity is proportional to the energy density @xmath17 and the mean free time @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    "the entropy density is proportional to the number density @xmath35 .",
    "therefore @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the average particle energy .",
    "thus , from the heisenberg principle for time - energy , we obtain the bound modulo the numerical constant .",
    "another important hint to establish the bound comes from the computation done by buchel , liu and starinets @xcite where they obtained the leading correction to the @xmath0 parameter in inverse powers of the t hooft coupling using the @xmath38 corrected low energy effective action for the typeiib string theory , dual to the @xmath39 , @xmath40 sym .",
    "they found the beautiful result : @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the riemann @xmath13-function so that @xmath43 is the apry constant .",
    "therefore the correction to the ratio @xmath0 is positive and diverges for the t hooft coupling @xmath5 approaching zero , and saturates the bound for @xmath5 growing to infinity . assuming",
    "a smooth extrapolation between the two regimes one can infer the validity of the bound for any value of @xmath5 . finally , we have knowledge of no fluid that undercomes the bound . for all fluids examined so far ,",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is well above the bound for the range of measured temperatures and preasures .",
    "this includes also superfluid helium and even trapped @xmath44 at strong coupling @xcite .    an obvious consequence of the kss conjecture ( if correct ) , is the absence of perfect fluids in nature , since the entropy density will only vanish at absolute zero .",
    "is this physically acceptable ?",
    "of course , ideal fluids have been a source of interesting paradoxes .    already in non relativistic fluid dynamics",
    "one encounters the dalembert paradox ( an ideal fluid with no boundaries exerts no force on a body moving through it , i.e. there is no lift force ) . from",
    "it follows the umconfortable impossibilityh of flying or swimming .",
    "of course , the difficulty disappears if there are no perfect fluids .    as a more recent conceptual difficulty of ideal fluids",
    ", we recall that it has been pointed out that the accretion of an ideal fluid onto a black hole could violate the generalized second law of thermodynamics @xcite , suggesting a possible connection between this law and the kss bound .    in conclusion",
    ", the existence of a minimum viscosity would put to rest a number of problems in fluid mechanics , so the bound is not unwelcome by theorists .",
    "the 3834 m long relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is operated at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) for , among others , au+au collisions ( a= 197 ) , and can reach a center of mass energy per nucleon of @xmath45 gev with a luminosity @xmath46 .",
    "it has four experiments called star , phenix , brahms and phobos .",
    "we highlight some ( preliminary ) results from rhic :    * thermochemical models describe well the different particle yields fitting to @xmath47 and baryon chemical potential @xmath48 for @xmath49 per nucleon . * from observed transversity and rapidity distributions ,",
    "the bjorken model predicts an energy density at time @xmath50 of @xmath51 whereas the critical density is about @xmath52 , i.e. the matter created may be well above the threshold for quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation . * a surprising amount of collective flow",
    "is observed in the outgoing hadrons @xcite , both in the single particle transverse momentum distribution ( radial flow ) and in the asymmetric azimuthal distribution around the beam axis ( elliptic flow ) .    for our purposes ,",
    "the main conclusions derivable from these preliminary results are :    * fluid dynamics with very low viscosity reproduces the measurements of radial and elliptic flow up to transverse momenta of 1.5 gev . * collective flow is probably generated early in the collision , probably in the qgp phase before hadronization .",
    "the qgp seems to be more strongly interacting than expected on the basis of perturbative qcd and asymptotic freedom ( hence the low viscosity ) .",
    "an alternative exists , fast , instability - driven , equilibration @xcite . *",
    "some preliminary estimations of @xmath0 based on elliptic flow @xcite and transverse momentum correlations @xcite seem to be compatible with value close to 0.08 ( the kss bound ) .",
    "this would make it the most perfect fluid known .",
    "several avenues to theoretically break the kss bound have been pursued .",
    "if one tries to undercome a bound on @xmath0 , the possible strategies are to either decrease the viscosity at fixed entropy density , or to increase the entropy density at fixed viscosity .",
    "we now briefly comment on these attempts and their status .",
    "this possibility was realized already in @xcite and has been exploited in detail in @xcite not without some controversy @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that in principle it could be possible to avoid the kss bound in a non - relativistic system with constant cross section and a large number @xmath53 of non - identical , degenerate particles , by increasing the gibbs mixing entropy .",
    "it is possible that the kss bound applies only to systems that can be obtained from a `` sensible '' ( uv complete ) qft .",
    "is it possible to find a non - relativistic system coming from a sensible qft that violates the kss bound for large degeneracy ? as an interesting example we can consider the case of a massive non linear sigma model ( nlsm ) based on the coset @xmath54 . then in the non relativistic limit it is possible to find @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the @xmath53 degenerated pseudo goldstone bosons , @xmath57 is the nlsm scale parameter , @xmath35 is the particle number density and @xmath5 is the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath58 . the above result is valid only in the region @xmath59 and @xmath60 . inside this region",
    "the kss bound is satisfied provided @xmath53 is not very large , but it fails if @xmath53 is exponentially large .",
    "the nlsm is not an uv complete theory but in principle we have at least two ways to complete it .",
    "first , simply qcd , since the above nlsm is the lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory at the lowest order with @xmath61 for @xmath62 degenerated quarks since @xmath63 .",
    "this corresponds to having three goldstone bosons ( pions ) .",
    "then it would appear that increasing the number of the qcd flavors , which implies increasing the number of goldstone bosons , one could undermine the kss bound according to the formula above .",
    "however this is not the case since , at it is well known , one can not increase the qcd flavor number without changing the sign the derivative of the @xmath64 function at the origin , @xmath65 ( here @xmath53 is the qcd coupling , not the pion degeneracy ) and presumably qcd is not well defined outside the asymptotic freedom regime .",
    "in addition the above formula applies only for nlsm coset @xmath54 whilst the chiral qcd coset is @xmath66 .",
    "both families of cosets meet only for @xmath61 and @xmath62 but not in the general case .",
    "thus the above results does not describe low - energy qcd for @xmath53 different from 3 .",
    "the other possibility for completing the nlsm is by introducing the corresponding liner sigma model ( lsm ) since the nlsm can be considered as the low energy limit of the lsm for large @xmath67 ( higgs ) masses and the lsm is , at least perturbatively a well defined renormalizable qft . in this case , and for the same regime of validity than in the nlsm , we get the same result for @xmath0",
    ". thus , for an exponentially large @xmath53 we can violate the kss bound .",
    "is there any way out for the kss conjecture ? in principle",
    "there is one .",
    "the above computation only considered binary interactions , but even at very small temperatures we have an exponential number of non - elastic processes which make the system metastable with a very weak tendency to relax to a state where the density is fixed by the condition @xmath68 and where the result above does not apply any more . another possibility to keep",
    "the validity of the kss bound is the almost established triviality of the lsm which would ruin this way to complete the nlsm through a _",
    "sensible _ qft theory .",
    "the concept of multiple substitutions in complex molecules , yielding an exponentially ( factorially ) large number of isomers , is illustrated in figure [ fig : ful ] .",
    "although we have not been able to clearly identify a family of currently synthesyzed molecules , because of the complicated interplay of tightness of binding , excluded volume , sublimation temperature , etc .",
    "that vary together with the number of substitutable nodes , the possibility remains a priori .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=192 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]    it is not clear how the argument of ultraviolet completion and a discussion about the completion of the standard model would affect a non - relativistic gas ( the relevant case for most of our physical reality ) . from a practical point of view",
    ", although we know of no fluid that violates the bound , it is not obvious how this empirical fact is tied to the `` weak '' form of the conjecture that requires good uv behavior , since by arguments of scale separation , the low - energy effective theory would be all needed to describe reality to a given precision .",
    "investigations continue .      another possible source of violation of the bound comes from considering changes of the scattering cross - sections in the gas that decrease the viscosity .    from the point of view of the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the bound is saturated for standard general relativity . however , on general grounds , one expects to have higher derivative corrections to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "for example one could consider the case of a theory with a gravity dual described at low energy by a gauss - bonnet gravity action : @xmath69\\ ] ] where @xmath70 . in this case",
    "it is possible to find @xcite : @xmath71 this result is non perturbative in @xmath72 and shows that the bound can be violated for positive @xmath72 .",
    "one could argue that this result is suspicious since it does not make sense for @xmath73 .",
    "however in @xcite it is shown that , in order to avoid microcausality violations in the corresponding cft we need to have @xmath74 this leaves room for violation of the kss bound but requires @xmath75 for the gauss - bonnet theory to be consistent .",
    "however there could be other additional consistency constraints in the theory forcing the @xmath72 parameter to vanish or be negative thus reestablishing the validity of the kss bound .",
    "holographic bound in the meson gas at high temperature are spurious : in this graph we show how the cross section computed within unitarized chiral perturbation theory by means of the inverse amplitude method , respects the bound @xmath1 for all conceivable temperatures that the hadron gas might attain ( right ) .",
    "violations reported are due to an unphysically small ( large ) viscosity ( cross section ) induced by unitarity violations . for comparison",
    ", we show a similar calculation with the unitarized linear sigma model ( left ) that yields the same result .",
    "[ fig : unitarity],title=\"fig:\",height=268 ]    holographic bound in the meson gas at high temperature are spurious : in this graph we show how the cross section computed within unitarized chiral perturbation theory by means of the inverse amplitude method , respects the bound @xmath1 for all conceivable temperatures that the hadron gas might attain ( right ) .",
    "violations reported are due to an unphysically small ( large ) viscosity ( cross section ) induced by unitarity violations . for comparison , we show a similar calculation with the unitarized linear sigma model ( left ) that yields the same result . [",
    "fig : unitarity],title=\"fig:\",height=268 ]    from the qft point of view , a way to decrease the viscosity without affecting the entropy in excess is to increase the interparticle interaction . this has been remarked in the past , in particular in the context of the pion gas .",
    "we however have shown that the method fails because unitarity imposes a bound on the cross - section .",
    "thus , the extrapolation of the low - energy effective theory for pions ( chpt to first or second order ) to higher energies , ceases to be valid when resonances in the meson gas are reached ( @xmath67 , @xmath76 , etc . ) .",
    "a properly unitarized method such as the iam has been reported in reference @xcite and is plotted in figure [ fig : unitarity ] , where we have extended our past calculations to include strange mesons ( @xmath77 , @xmath8 ) and their lowest resonances through the @xmath78 iam @xcite .",
    "recently csernai , kapusta and mclerran @xcite made the observation that , in all systems whose @xmath79 plot has been examined , the minimum of @xmath0 and the liquid - gas phase transition happen at the same temperature .",
    "this fact can be roughly understood because in a gas , as the temperature increases , there is more efficient momentum transport and then the viscosity goes to infinity .",
    "however in a liquid , which can be seen as a mixture of clusters and voids , molecules swap voids less efficiently at low temperature .",
    "then as temperature decreases there are less voids and consequently more shear momentum transport due to adhesivity among layers , so that the viscosity takes also off to infinity .    therefore somewhere between the two phases",
    "the viscosity should have a minimum .",
    "empirically , for standard fluids , @xmath0 is found to reach its minimum at or near the critical temperature .",
    "thus , apparently there is a connection between @xmath0 and the phase transition but we do not have any clear theory of this @xcite .",
    "for example we ignore if there are universal critical exponents for the different kind of phase transitions .",
    "a very interesting possibility is that the same behavior observed in ordinary liquids could also occur in qcd .",
    "if this were the case , an experimental determination of the @xmath0 minimum could give information about the qcd phase transition and whether there is a critical end - point .",
    "this direction has been explored in @xcite .",
    "is expected to have a minimum but not a discontinuity at the predicted cross - over between the hadron phase and the quark and gluon plasma phase .",
    "we have reexamined the computation in the hadron phase with more detailed than past work , but a discontinuity remains , maybe due to the uncertainties in the quark - gluon plasma side .",
    "this observable is a promising tag of a possible critical end point in the qcd phase - diagram .",
    "[ fig : salto],height=288 ]    the hadron - gas phase has been examined with great care by us @xcite and close colleagues @xcite , so that great improvements are not to be expected .",
    "the quark and gluon plasma phase , however , is less known in the strong - coupling regime and requires more work .",
    "the situation is represented in figure [ fig : salto ] . at high baryon chemical potential",
    "one would expect a jump in the ratio @xmath0 ( by analogy with common substances ) at a first order phase transition , but a continuous minimum at low baryon - density where one expects a cross - over .",
    "current computations of @xmath0 from the hadron phase are quite mature , but the quark - gluon plasma has not yet been refined beyond high-@xmath27 perturbation theory .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence makes possible to study new aspects of qft such as viscosity and other hydrodynamic behavior .",
    "the kss bound set a new limit on how perfect a fluid can be coming from holography which was completely unexpected . from the experimental stand point",
    "there is no counter example for this bound . from the rhic data we observe a large amount of collective flow that can be properly described by hydrodynamic models with low viscosity compatible with the kss bound .",
    "some theoretical models suggest that unitarity could be related in some way with the kss bound .",
    "there is a theoretical counter example of the bound in a non - relativistic model with large degeneracy .",
    "however possibly the model is not uv complete because of the triviality of the lsm .",
    "this could be an indication that a more precise formulation of the bound is needed .",
    "some open questions are the following : is the bound correct for some well defined formulation ?",
    "could it be possible to really measure @xmath0 at rhic with precision enough to check the kss bound ?",
    "are there any connections between the kss and the entropy bekenstein bounds ? how are the minima of @xmath0 related to phase transitions ? could it be considered an order parameter ?      * acknowledgements * this work has been partially supported by the dgicyt ( spain ) under grants fpa 2004 - 02602 and fpa 2005 - 02327 and by the universidad complutense / cam , project number 910309 and bsch - pr34/07 - 15875 .",
