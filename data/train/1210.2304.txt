    "the differential emission measure ( dem ) diagnostic technique offers crucial information about the thermal structuring of the solar and stellar atmospheres , providing a measure of the temperature distribution of the plasma along the line of sight ( los ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectrometers are by nature better suited to dem analysis than broad band imagers .",
    "but , because these latter generally offer a higher signal to noise ratio over a larger field of view ( fov ) , dem codes have nevertheless been applied to the three coronal bands of the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) @xcite or the transition region and coronal explorer  ( trace , * ? ?",
    "however , these instruments were shown not to constrain the dem enough to reach conclusive results . in recent years , the multiplication of passbands in instruments such as the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on _ hinode _",
    "@xcite and the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) telescope  @xcite has brought new prospects to reliably estimate the dem simultaneously over a large fov .",
    "case studies of the properties of the inversion using these instruments have been published by e.g. ,  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "building on these results , the central objective of the work presented in this series of papers is to provide a systematic characterization of the dem reconstruction problem to assess both its accuracy and robustness . using our technique ,",
    "the capabilities of a given instrument can be evaluated , and new tools facilitating the dem interpretation are presented .",
    "we illustrate our methodology in the specific case of the six coronal bands of aia , but the same principle can be applied to any set of broad band or spectroscopic measurements .    initially introduced for element abundance measurements ,",
    "then further developed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , the dem formalism has been extensively used in the past decades , on most types of coronal structures , such as polar coronal holes  @xcite , polar plumes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , streamers  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the thermal structuring of the stellar coronae is also investigated using the dem analysis  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the dem is one of the tools commonly used to study the thermal stability of the coronal structures just mentioned , and to diagnose the energy source balancing the observed radiative losses .",
    "for example , it can help to discriminate between steady or impulsive heating models predicting different loop thermal structures  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the approaches is to establish the cross field thermal structure of resolved loops which is then compared to the dem simulated for unresolved multi - stranded and monolitic loops , impulsively or steadily heated .    but",
    "reliably inferring the dem from observations has proved to be a genuine challenge .",
    "the fundamental limitations in the dem inversion have been discussed by , e.g. ,  @xcite , including measurement noises , systematic errors , the width and shape of the contribution functions , and the associated consequences of multiple solutions and limited temperature resolution .",
    "many dem inversion algorithms have been proposed to cope with these limitations , each with its own strengths and weaknesses  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "authors have been attentive early on to estimate the accuracy of the inversions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ".    due to the intrinsic underconstraint of inverse problems and to the inevitable presence of random and systematic measurement errors , multiple physical solutions consistent with the observations exist , even if mathematical uniqueness and stability can be ensured via , e.g. , regularization .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to quantify the amount of knowledge , or ignorance , on the physical parameter of interest by rigorously defining levels of confidence in the possible solutions or classes of solutions that can explain the observations within the uncertainties .",
    "this is a desirable feature for any inversion scheme if it is to be able , for example , to discriminate or even to define , isothermality and multithermality .",
    "in this perspective , we developed a technique to systematically explore the whole space of solutions , in order to determine their respective probabilities and quantify the robustness of the inversion with respect to plasma parameters , random and systematic errors .",
    "we used data simulated with simple dem forms to systematically scan a wide range of plasma conditions , from isothermal to broadly multithermal , and several inversion hypotheses . comparing the dem solutions to the input of the simulations ,",
    "it is possible to quantify the quality of the inversion . following this strategy ,",
    "we are able to completely characterize the statistical properties of the inversion for several parametric dem distributions .",
    "we argue that even though the specifics may vary , the main conclusions concerning the existence of multiple solutions and the ability to distinguish isothermality from multithermality also apply to more generic forms of dem distributions .    in this first paper",
    ", we focus on the response of aia to isothermal plasmas . the properties of the isothermal inversion thus observed will serve as building blocks for the interpretation of the more complex dem solutions studied in the second paper ( hereafter paper ii ) .",

    "a summary introducing the treatment of more generic dem forms is given in conclusion .",
    "under the assumption that the observed plasma is optically thin , integration along the line of sight ( los ) of collisional emission lines and continua produces in the spectral band @xmath1 of an instrument an intensity @xmath2 where @xmath3 , the response of the instrument to a unit volume of plasma of electron number density @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 , is given by @xmath6 the first term of the right member accounts for each spectral line @xmath7 of each ionic species @xmath8 of abundance @xmath9 , and the second term represents the contribution of the continua .",
    "@xmath10 is the spectral sensitivity of the band  @xmath1 of the instrument .",
    "the respective contribution functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the lines and continua contain the physics of the radiation emission processes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can be computed using the relevant atomic data . as long as one considers total line intensities , equations  ( [ eq_1 ] ) and  ( [ eq_2 ] ) are generic and apply to imaging telescopes as well as to spectrometers .",
    "summarizing the original reasoning of  @xcite , since the function @xmath3 is generally weakly dependent on the density and is peaked with temperature , @xmath13 gives a measure of @xmath14 where the integration is now limited to the portions @xmath15 of the los where the temperature is such that significant emission is produced .",
    "if measurements are available at several wavebands , it is possible to plot @xmath14 as a function of the bands peak temperatures .",
    "generalizing this logic into a differential form , and assuming that the element abundances are constant , equation  ( [ eq_1 ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dem , that provides a measure of the amount of emitting plasma as a function of temperature ) .",
    "the dem can also be defined in linear scale as @xmath18 .",

    "as demonstrated by  @xcite , @xmath20 is the mean square electron density over the regions @xmath21 of the los at temperature @xmath5 , weighted by the inverse of the temperature gradients in these regions . the total emission measure ( em )",
    "is obtained by integrating the dem over the temperature @xmath22 solving the dem integral equation  ( [ eq_3 ] ) implies reversing the image acquisition , los integration and photon emission processes to derive the distribution of temperature in the solar corona from observed spectral line intensities",
    ". we will now investigate the properties of this inversion .",
    "let us consider a plasma characterized by a dem @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding intensities observed in @xmath24 spectral bands are noted @xmath25 . in order to solve the dem inverse problem - estimating @xmath26 from the observations -",
    "one uses a criterion @xmath27 that defines the distance between the data @xmath28 and the theoretical intensities @xmath29 computed using equations  ( [ eq_2 ] ) and  ( [ eq_3 ] ) for any dem @xmath30 . by definition",
    "the dem @xmath31 solution of the inversion is the one that minimizes this criterion : @xmath32 since the @xmath28 are affected by measurement noises and the @xmath33 by systematic errors in the calibration and atomic physics , the inversion can yield different solutions @xmath34 of probabilities @xmath35 for a given dem @xmath26 of the plasma .",
    "bayes theorem then gives @xmath36 which is the conditional probability that the plasma has a dem @xmath26 knowing the result @xmath34 of the inversion .",
    "@xmath37 is the total probability of obtaining @xmath34 whatever @xmath26 . in the bayesian framework",
    ", @xmath38 is called the _",
    "prior_. it is uniformly distributed if there is no _ a priori _ information on the dem @xmath26 of the plasma .",
    "conversely , _ a priori _ knowledge or assumptions on the plasma are represented by a varying @xmath38 .",
    "for example , zero probabilities can be assigned to non physical solutions .",
    "@xmath39 contains all the information that can be obtained from a given set of measurements on the real dem @xmath26 of the plasma and as such , it is a desirable quantity to evaluate . indeed ,",
    "if the dem is to be used to discriminate between physical models , as it is for example the case in the coronal heating debate , finding a solution that minimizes the criterion is necessary , but it is not sufficient .",
    "it is also crucial to be able to determine if other solutions are consistent with the uncertainties , what are their respective probabilities , and how much they differ from each other .    in principle , and without _ a priori _ on the plasma , @xmath35 and thus @xmath39 can be estimated for any minimization scheme using monte - carlo simulations  @xcite . for each @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath24 observed @xmath25 are simulated using equations  ( [ eq_2 ] ) and  ( [ eq_3 ] ) and adding photon and instrumental noises .",
    "systematic errors are incorporated to the @xmath33 and the resulting criterion is minimized .",
    "@xmath35 is then evaluated from the @xmath40 solutions @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath40 realizations of the random variables .",
    "but since several @xmath26 can potentially yield the same @xmath34 , the derivation of @xmath39 from equation  ( [ eq_6 ] ) requires to know @xmath41 , the probability to obtain @xmath34 whatever @xmath26 .",
    "this is generally not possible , for it requires the exploration of an infinite number of plasma dems .",
    "this is why dem inversion research often focuses on the minimization part of the problem , @xmath39 being supposed to be well behaved because of the proper choice of _ prior _ and the multiplication of passbands or spectral lines .",
    "however , @xmath39 can be computed if the dem @xmath26 of the plasma can be described by a limited number of parameters . in this case",
    ", one can scan the whole parameter space and use the monte - carlo simulations to estimate @xmath35 for all possible @xmath26 .",
    "the possibility that multiple @xmath26 yield an identical inversion solution @xmath34 being now taken into account , one can determine @xmath41 and thus derive @xmath39 from equation  ( [ eq_6 ] ) .",
    "this limitation of the complexity of the dems that can be considered corresponds to adopting a non - uniform _ prior _ @xmath38 , while probabilistic treatments were justly developed with the opposite objective of relaxing such non - physical assumptions  ( e.g. the mcmc method of * ? ? ?",
    "but rather than the development of a generic dem inversion method , our objective is to study the behaviour of @xmath39 in controlled experiments . and",
    "if the parameterization is properly chosen , the @xmath26 can still represent a variety of plasma conditions , from isothermal to broadly multithermal .",
    "in addition , we did not make any assumption on the number and properties of the spectral bands , nor on the definition of the criterion nor on the algorithm used to minimize it .",
    "the method described to compute @xmath39 can therefore be used to characterize any inversion scheme in the range of physical conditions covered by the chosen @xmath26 distributions .",
    "devising an efficient way to locate the absolute minimum of the criterion is not trivial .",
    "for example , without further assumption , its definition alone does not guarantee that it has a single minimum , so that iterative algorithms may converge to different local minima depending on the initial guess solution .",
    "furthermore , if the value of the minimum itself is a measure of the goodness of fit , it does not provide information on the robustness of the solution .",
    "how well the solution is constrained is instead related to the topography of the minimum and its surroundings ; the minimum may be deep or shallow and wide or narrow with respect to the different parameters describing the dem curve .",
    "the number of dems resulting in significantly different sets of intensities within the dynamic range of an instrument is potentially extremely large .",
    "however , a systematic mapping of the criterion aimed at revealing its minima and their topography is possible if the search is restricted to a subclass of all possible dem forms . indeed ,",
    "if the dem is fully determined by a limited number of parameters , one can regularly sample the parameter space and compute once and for all the corresponding theoretical intensities @xmath29 .",
    "the criterion , i.e. the distance between the @xmath33 and the measured @xmath28 , is thus computable as a function of the dem parameters for any given set of observations .",
    "it is then trivial to find its absolute minimum and the corresponding dem solution @xmath34 , or to visualize it as a function of the dem parameters .",
    "the procedure used to compute @xmath39 is summarized in figure  [ fig : method ] .",
    "the parametric dem forms are described in section  [ sec : dem_models ] .",

    "the only difference between the two conventions is the sign of @xmath45 .",
    "the criterion and therefore the results are identical in both cases . ] to the reference theoretical intensities @xmath42 .",
    "the distributions of random and systematic errors are discussed in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "the detail of the calculation of the @xmath42 is given in section  [ sec : theoretical_intensities ] .",
    "from these , we can either simulate observations @xmath28 by adding measurement noises @xmath43 ( equation  ( [ eq : iobs ] ) ) , or obtain various estimates of the @xmath33 by adding perturbations representing the systematics @xmath45 ( equation  ( [ eq : ith ] ) ) .",

    "finally , @xmath39 is obtained after scanning all possible plasma dems ( section  [ sec : monte - carlo ] ) .",
    "ensuing the discussions of sections  [ sub_sec_2_2 ] and  [ sub_sec_2_3 ] , the @xmath26 and @xmath34 are both constrained to belong to one of the three following classes of dem distributions defined by two or three parameters :    * isothermal @xmath48 where the dem is reduced to a dirac @xmath49 function centred on the temperature @xmath50 .",

    "there is no reason for the solar plasma to follow one of these distributions , nor are they the only possible choices .",
    "but even though they are simple enough to allow a detailed analysis of the properties of the dem inversion , they can nonetheless represent a variety of plasma conditions .",
    "the conclusions drawn can therefore help understand the behaviour of more generic dem forms .",
    "furthermore , since the class of solution dems @xmath34 does not have to be the same as that of the plasma dems @xmath26 , it is possible to investigate the impact of a wrong assumption on the shape of the dem .",

    "this function implements the aia pre - flight calibration as described in  @xcite .",
    "since photon shot noise must be taken into account in the error budget ( section  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) , the @xmath55 must be computed for given exposure times and not per second .",
    "we used the standard aia exposures of 2 s for the 17.1 nm and 19.3 nm bands , and 2.9 s for the others .",
    "the contribution functions are computed using chianti from @xmath62 to @xmath63 in steps of @xmath64 , oversampling the chianti grid by a factor 10 using cubic spline interpolations .",
    "the emission measure varies over a wide range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 in steps of @xmath67 .",
    "the dem width varies linearly in 80 steps from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "this choice of sampling leads to pre - computing @xmath70 groups of 6 aia intensities , which represents easily manageable data cubes .",
    "uncertainties due to random and systematic errors are at the heart of the problem of the dem inversion .",
    "the two affect the observations and their interpretation in different manners  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observations are mostly affected by random errors caused by both poisson photon shot noise and nearly gaussian detection noises like thermal and read noise .",
    "these noises vary randomly from pixel to pixel and from exposure to exposure . on the other hand ,",
    "the errors made on the calibration and atomic physics systematically skew the interpretation of all observed intensities by the same amount and in the same direction .",
    "it is possible to realistically simulate in the @xmath28 the statistical properties of the noises affecting the data .",
    "the reference intensities @xmath42 have units of digital numbers ( dn ) .",
    "the number of electrons collected in each pixel over the exposure time is obtained by multiplying these values by the gains ( in @xmath71 ) of the detectors analog to digital converters listed in ssw .",
    "the number of detected photons is then obtained by dividing the result by the quantum yield of the detector , _ i.e. _ the number of photoelectrons produced per interacting photon where 3.65 is the energy in ev required to create an electron hole pair , @xmath72 is the elementary charge , @xmath73 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath74 is planck s constant .",
    "note that in this calculation we assume that all interacting photons have the same wavelength .",
    "however , since the full width at half maximum of the aia bands is comprised between 0.2 and 1.0 nm , the error made is only a few @xmath75 . ] .",
    "these photon intensities are then perturbed by poisson noise and converted back to photoelectrons .",
    "22 @xmath76 rms of gaussian ccd read noise  @xcite are finally added before conversion to dn .",
    "determining the statistical properties of the systematic errors is more challenging .",
    "the tabulated calibration and atomic physics provides a single estimate of the instrument response @xmath77 , but systematics nonetheless have a probability distribution .",
    "indeed , the calibration is the result of laboratory measurements themselves affected by random and systematic errors .",
    "if we could recalibrate the instrument a number of times in different facilities we would obtain a distribution of instrumental sensitivities @xmath10 , the adopted calibration corresponding to one of them .",
    "likewise , different atomic physics codes will give different estimates of the contribution functions @xmath78 , the chianti output being one of them .",
    "it is however difficult to characterize these two probability distributions .",
    "they are generally implicitly assumed to be gaussian and the adopted values to be the most probable .",
    "but the distributions may in fact be uniform , or asymmetric , or biased , _",
    "etc_.    the calibration involves a complex chain of measurements , the uncertainties of which are difficult to track and estimate .",
    "after independent radiometric calibrations , comparable euv instruments on soho were found to agree only within about 25%  @xcite .",
    "subsequent comparisons could not resolve the discrepancies nor identify their origin in random errors or biases in the individual calibrations .",
    "we can only say that the adopted calibration of every soho instrument introduces a systematic error in the data analysis but without being able to tell how much and in what direction .",
    "it is likely that inter - calibration between aia and other instruments would run into similar limitations .",
    "errors in the contribution functions are a major contributor to the uncertainties  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the properties of the known atomic transitions are derived either from measurements or modelling , they are not infinitely accurate .",
    "missing transitions lead to underestimated contributions functions , as it is the case for the 9.4 nm channel of aia  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the abundances are affected by about 10% uncertainties  @xcite , not taking into account possible local enhancements of high fip elements  @xcite .",
    "these imply that , at least in some cases , the abundances are not constant along the line of sight , as assumed in the dem analysis",
    ". the plasma may not be in ionization balance , in which case the chianti calculations of transition rates are not valid .",
    "the response functions @xmath77 of aia are also not independent from the electron number density , which is one of the assumptions made in deriving the dem expression from equations  ( [ eq_1 ] ) to  ( [ eq_3 ] ) . when using spectrometers , the spectral lines are chosen so that this hypothesis is effectively verified .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : g - vs - n ] the normalized maximum of @xmath79 versus electron number density . in the aia field of view",
    ", @xmath4 can vary from about @xmath80 in coronal holes at @xmath81  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to about @xmath82 in dense coronal loops  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this range ,",
    "only the 9.4 nm band ( solid line ) is completely independent on the density .",
    "the response function of all other bands decreases as the density increases , the variation reaching about 35% for the 17.1 nm band ( short dashed line ) .",
    "since the contribution functions have to be computed for a constant electron number density ( we chose @xmath83 ) , they are respectively under or over - estimated if the observed structures are more or less dense .",
    "the impact can be mitigated if one has independent knowledge of the range of densities on the los , but it nonetheless represents an additional source of uncertainty compared to using density insensitive spectral lines .",
    "finally , these various sources of uncertainties do not affect all spectral bands by the same amount .    rigorously estimating the properties of the probability distributions of the systematic errors would thus require a detailed analysis of the calibration process and of the atomic physics data and models that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in these conditions , we make the simplifying assumption that all systematics are gaussian distributed and unbiased . according to @xcite , uncertainties on the pre - flight instrument calibration are of the order of 25% .",
    "this is thus interpreted as a gaussian probability distribution centred on the tabulated values with a 25% standard deviation .",
    "likewise , we used 25% uncertainty on the atomic physics for all bands , typical of the estimates found in the literature .",
    "calibration and atomic physics uncertainties were added quadratically for a net 35% uncertainty on the response functions @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath33 are thus obtained by adding gaussian random perturbations to the @xmath42 .      since",
    "instrumental noises and systematic errors are assumed to be gaussian distributed , we use a least square criterion @xmath84 normalized to the total standard deviation @xmath85 of the uncertainties in each band .",
    "@xmath85 is obtained by summing quadratically the standard deviations of the four individual contributions : photon noise , read noise , calibration and atomic physics ( section  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) .",
    "the value of the minimum of @xmath27 corresponding to the solution @xmath34 is noted @xmath86    from equations  ( [ eq : ith ] ) and  ( [ eq : iobs ] ) we get @xmath87 if the family of solutions ( dirac , gaussian or top hat ) is identical to that of the plasma dem @xmath26 , then in the absence of noise @xmath88 and the solution @xmath34 given by equation  ( [ eq_5 ] ) is strictly equal to @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the presence of random and systematic errors or if the assumed dem form differs from that of the observed plasma , @xmath89 is not likely to be zero and the corresponding @xmath34 may be different from @xmath26 , for random fluctuations of @xmath43 and @xmath45 can compensate a difference between @xmath90 and @xmath91 . as discussed in section  [ sec : fit_test ] , properly interpreting the value of @xmath89 provides a means of testing the pertinence of a given dem model .",
    "folding equation  ( [ eq : ith_iso ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ith_gauss ] ) or  ( [ eq : ith_hat ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) , we obtain the expression of @xmath27 for the corresponding dem distributions .",
    "given a set of observed intensities and a dem model , the criterion can therefore be easily computed for all possible combinations of the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath50 , and @xmath53 using the @xmath55 tabulated as described in section  [ sec : theoretical_intensities ] .",
    "finding its minimum and thus the solution @xmath34 is simplified to the location of the minimum of the @xmath27 matrix .",
    "this minimization scheme is not fast compared to , e.g. , iterative gradient algorithms , but it ensures that the absolute minimum of the criterion is found whatever its topography .",
    "furthermore , this operation can be efficiently implemented on the graphics processing units ( gpu ) of modern graphics cards by using their cuda capability .",
    "we implemented a scheme in which each gpu core is in charge of computing an element of the @xmath27 matrix , with all gpu cores running in parallel .",

    "integration over @xmath26 gives @xmath41 and using bayes theorem we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "in order to understand the fundamental properties of the dem inversion of the aia data , we first applied the method to investigate the behaviour of the isothermal solutions to simulations of isothermal plasmas . the electron temperatures and emission measures of the plasmas are noted @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the corresponding inverted quantities are noted @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath96 and @xmath97 are stored in matrices of dimension 4 . to maximize the clarity of the results , and since the thermal content of the plasma is the main object of dem analysis , we reduce the number of dimensions by fixing the emission measure of the simulated plasmas to be @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , the probabilities are always presented whatever the emission measure by integrating them over @xmath95 , even though @xmath95 is of course solved for in the inversion process .",
    "the chosen @xmath93 is typical of non flaring active regions  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : valid_bands_iso ] shows as a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 the number of aia bands in which a plasma produces more than 1  dn ( detection threshold ) and less than 11000  dn ( saturation ) .",
    "the left panel is for isothermal plasmas , the right panel for gaussian dems with @xmath99 . at the chosen @xmath93 , and",
    "since we did not implement the detector saturation in our simulations , we always have exploitable signal in all six aia coronal bands , except below a few @xmath100  k. conversely , solar structures outside the white areas produce signal only in some of the six bands , unless spatial or temporal summation is used .",
    "therefore , the results presented in the following sections correspond to optimum conditions outside of which the combination of higher noise and possible lower number of valid bands will always lead to weaker constraints on the dem .",
    "we first present inversion results using only three bands as an illustration of the situation encountered with previous euv imaging telescopes like eit , trace or euvi .",
    "the 17.1  nm and 19.5  nm coronal passbands of eit and trace have direct equivalents in aia , but the 28.4  nm band does not .",
    "after comparison of its isothermal response  ( see , e.g. , figure 9 of * ? ? ? * ) with those of aia ( figure  [ fig : aia_iso_response ] ) , we chose the 21.1  nm band as its closest aia counterpart .",
    "the three bands configuration is also similar to having six bands and a low emission measure plasma . indeed , at @xmath101 and @xmath102  k",
    ", values typical of coronal loops , only three of the six aia coronal bands produce more than 1  dn ( see figure  [ fig : valid_bands_iso ] ) , the others providing only upper limit constraints to the dem .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig:3bands ] shows a map of the probability and @xmath103 . ]",
    "it is worth noting that , as explained in section  [ sub_sec_2_2 ] , @xmath105 and thus @xmath106 could be evaluated only because the limitation to simple parameterized dem forms allowed the computation of @xmath104 .",
    "the plot of @xmath105 ( and thus the horizontal structures in panel ( a ) ) shows that some temperature solutions @xmath94 are more probable than others for any plasma temperature @xmath92 . in the case of real observations ,",
    "this can be misinterpreted as the ubiquitous presence of plasma at the most likely temperatures .",
    "this caveat was already analysed by  @xcite in the case of the 19.5 to 17.3 nm trace band ratio and we will discuss it further in paper ii for multithermal plasmas .    both probability maps exhibit a diagonal from which several branches bifurcate .",
    "below @xmath107  k and above @xmath70  k the diagonal disappears because since the bands have little sensitivity in these regions , the signal is dominated by noises and the inversion output is thus independent from the temperature . the general symmetry with respect to the diagonal reflects the equality @xmath108 .",
    "the diagonal is formed by the solutions @xmath94 that are close to the input @xmath92 , while the branches correspond to significant deviations from the input . in @xmath104 ,",
    "these branches imply that two or more solutions @xmath94 can be found for a same plasma temperature @xmath92 .",
    "conversely , reading horizontally the @xmath106 image , a given temperature solution @xmath94 can be coherent with two or more plasma temperatures @xmath92 .",
    "the ( b ) and ( c ) plots give the probability of the solutions for two plasma temperatures . at @xmath109",
    "k , the solution may be @xmath110  k or @xmath111  k. at the typical coronal temperature @xmath112  k , the inversion can yield @xmath102  k but also @xmath107  k or @xmath70  k. it is thus possible to incorrectly conclude to the presence of cool or hot coronal plasma while observing an average million degree corona .",
    "this ambiguity has far reaching implications since the detection of hot plasma is one of the possible signatures of nano - flares  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since by definition they correspond to the absolute minimum of the criterion , all solutions are fully consistent with the data given the uncertainties .",
    "one or more of the multiple solutions can be rejected only based on additional independent _ a priori _ information .",
    "for example , the high temperature solution corresponds to an emission measure of @xmath113 ( right panel of figure  [ fig : criterion ] ) , which is extremely high considering the present knowledge of the corona .",
    "if no such information is available however , both low and high temperature solutions can still be correctly interpreted as also compatible with a @xmath102  k plasma with the aid of the @xmath114 and @xmath115 probability profiles ( f ) and ( g ) .",
    "the reason for the formation of these branches is illustrated by figure  [ fig : criterion ] . on both panels , the background image is the value of the criterion @xmath27 for a @xmath112  k plasma as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the absolute minimum of the criterion , the arguments of which are the inverted parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( equation  ( [ eq_5 ] ) ) , corresponds to the darkest shade of grey and is marked by a white plus sign .",
    "the criterion is the sum of three components , one per waveband ( equations  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) and  ( [ eq : criterion_dev ] ) ) .",
    "the three superimposed curves are the loci emission measure curves for each band @xmath1 , i.e. the location of the ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) pairs for which the theoretical intensities @xmath33 equal the measured ones @xmath28 . below the loci curves ,",
    "the criterion is almost flat because at lower emission measures the @xmath33 are much smaller than the constant @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , the criterion is dominated by the @xmath116 at high emission measures .",
    "the darkest shades of gray and thus the minimum of the criterion are located between these two regions .",
    "the two panels correspond to two independent realizations of the random and systematic errors .",
    "for each draw , the loci curves are randomly shifted along the @xmath51 axis around their average position . in the absence of errors , the three loci curves would cross in a single point at the plasma temperature @xmath92 , giving a criterion strictly equal to zero . in the left panel , with random and systematic errors",
    "included , they do not intersect at a single point but the non - zero absolute minimum of @xmath117 , where they are the closest together , is around @xmath92 . however , the criterion has two other local minima , around @xmath107  k and around @xmath70  k , where two or three of the loci curves also bundle up . in the right panel , a different random draw shifts the curves closest together around the high temperature local minimum that thus becomes the new absolute minimum . for this @xmath102",
    "k plasma , the inversion thus yields solutions randomly located around the several local minima with respective probabilities given by the profile of figure  [ fig:3bands](c ) .",
    "when scanning the plasma temperatures , the positions of the minima vary , thus building the branches in the probability maps . in addition , depending on their location the minima can be more or less extended along one or the other axes , which results in a varying dispersion around the most probable solutions .",
    "systematic errors are simulated with random variables while they are in fact identical for all measurements .",
    "thus , the computed @xmath118 does not give the probability of solutions @xmath94 for the practical estimates of the calibration and atomic physics .",
    "in reality the output of the inversion is biased towards one or the other of the multiple solutions , but we do not know whether the calibration and atomic physics are under or over - estimated . therefore , in order to deduce the probability that the plasma has a temperature @xmath92 from an inverted temperature @xmath94 , we must account for the probabilities of the systematics as defined in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "the randomization samples their distribution , which ensures that the estimated @xmath119 are the probabilities relevant to interpret @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ fig:6bands ] is the same as figure  [ fig:3bands ] , but now including the six aia coronal bands in the analysis .",
    "some secondary solutions persist at low probabilities but compared to the three bands case , most of the solutions are now concentrated on the diagonal .",
    "this illustrates that the robustness of the inversion process increases with the number of bands or spectral lines .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig:3bands ] quantifies the improvement brought by aia over previous instruments . neglecting the low probability solutions ,",
    "if independent _ a priori _ knowledge justifies the isothermal hypothesis , the six aia bands thus provide an unambiguous determination of the plasma temperature .",
    "the temperature resolution of the inversion can be estimated from the width at half maximum of the diagonal .",
    "it varies over the temperature range between 0.03 and 0.11 @xmath120 .",
    "it is of course be modified if we assumed different uncertainties on the calibration and atomic physics than the ones chosen in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the temperature resolution to the level of uncertainties @xmath85 , from 10 to 55% .",
    "the higher the uncertainties , the lower the temperature resolution and the more probable the secondary solutions . for an estimated temperature @xmath94 of 1  mk",
    ", the temperature resolution of the inversion varies between 0.02 for 10% error and 0.08 @xmath120 for 55% error . in the worst case , for 55% errors , the temperature resolution decreases to @xmath121 for the temperature interval between 0.5 and 0.9 mk . at 1  mk ,",
    "the resolution is proportional to the uncertainty level with a coefficient of 0.15 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "since by definition our method always finds the absolute minimum of the least square criterion of equation  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) , the derived temperature resolution is an intrinsic property of the data and not of the inversion scheme .",
    "it is the result of the combination of the random and systematic errors and the shapes the contribution functions .",
    "its value is directly comparable with the findings of  @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the temperature resolution of the mcmc code of  @xcite applied to isothermal plasmas is 0.05 log @xmath123 .",
    "their tests were made on simulated observations of a @xmath124  k plasma in 45 isolated spectral lines with 20% random errors .",
    "assuming that the mcmc method does converge towards solutions consistent with the limitations of the data , the fact that the temperature resolution is comparable for 6 aia bands and 45 spectral lines suggests that , in the isothermal case , it is driven by the uncertainties level rather than the number of observables .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the isothermal limit of figure 6 of  @xcite .",
    "the probability maps presented in the above sections are valid for a given hypothesis on the plasma dem distribution , but they would be useless without a test of its validity .",
    "the pertinence of the dem model chosen to interpret the observations can be assessed by analyzing the distribution of the sum of squared residuals defined by equations  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) . if applying our inversion scheme to real data , we could compare the resulting residuals to the distribution derived from simulations for a given dem model and thus quantify the probability that the data is consistent with the working hypothesis ( e.g. isothermal or gaussian ) .",
    "the solid line histogram of figure  [ fig : chi2_iso ] shows the distribution of @xmath89 values corresponding to the plots of figure  [ fig:6bands ] .",
    "the distribution is close to a degree  4 @xmath89 distribution ( solid curve ) although not a perfect match , with a peak shifted to the left and an enhanced wing .",
    "the most probable value of the squared residuals is @xmath125 and @xmath126% of them are comprised between 0 and 15 .",
    "whatever the actual plasma dem , any inversion made with the isothermal hypothesis and yielding a @xmath89 value in this range can thus be considered consistent with an isothermal plasma given the uncertainties .",
    "this isothermality test is similar to that recommended by  @xcite , identifying our @xmath89 to their @xmath127 and our maximum acceptable @xmath89 to their @xmath128 .",
    "this does not imply however that isothermality is the only nor the best possible interpretation of the data , for different dems can produce similar @xmath89 values .",
    "the discrimination between dem models will be discussed in paper ii .",
    "the properties of the empirical distribution of squared residuals can be explained as follows . since we simulated observations of a purely isothermal plasma",
    ", an isothermal model can always represent the data .",
    "without errors , there would always be one unique couple ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) corresponding to six intensities perfectly matching the six aia observations , thus giving zero residuals . with errors ,",
    "if we forced the solution ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) to be the input ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , the summed squared residuals resulting from a number of random draws should have by definition the probability density function ( pdf ) of a degree six @xmath89 distribution ( dotted curve of figure  [ fig : chi2_iso ] ) , for we have six independent values of @xmath129 and we normalized the residuals to the standard deviation @xmath85 of the uncertainties .",
    "but since we solve for two parameters ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) by performing a least squares minimization at each realization of the errors , the solution is not exactly the input ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) and we should expect a pdf with two degrees of freedom less ( dashed curve ) . instead of being a pure degree  4 , the observed distribution",
    "is slightly shifted toward a degree 3 because of two factors .",
    "first , the errors are a combination of poisson photon noise and gaussian read noise , while the @xmath89 distribution is defined for standard normal random variables .",
    "second , as discussed below , the six residuals are not completely independent .",
    "figure  [ fig : aia_iso_response ] shows the response functions @xmath59 of the aia bands to isothermal plasmas with electron temperatures from @xmath100 to @xmath130  k for a constant electron number density of @xmath83 . for each band ,",
    "the thick curve is the total response , and the labeled thin curves are the partial responses for the ions that contribute the most for at least one temperature . the fraction of the total response not accounted for by those dominant ions is shown below each main plot .",
    "ionization stages common to several bands are found across the whole range of temperatures .",
    "dominates the response at @xmath131  k in the 17.1  nm , 19.3  nm and 21.1  nm bands . around 1  mk ,",
    "is found in the 17.1  nm , 19.3  nm and 21.1  nm responses , and contributes to the 94  nm , 21.1  nm and 33.5  nm bands . at 2 mk , is common to the 21.1  nm and 33.5  nm bands .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of the aia bands by  @xcite .",
    "because of this redundancy , the response functions tend to have similar shapes in the regions of overlap , resulting in a correlation between the residuals .",
    "by restricting the solutions to functional forms described by a limited number of parameters , we obtained a complete statistical characterization of the dem inversion . even though they are not expected to accurately describe real coronal properties",
    ", these simple dem distributions can nonetheless model a wide range of plasma conditions .",
    "the results presented in this series of papers can thus be fruitfully used to demonstrate many important properties and guide the interpretation of the output of generic dem inversion codes .",
    "we illustrated the method by applying it to the six coronal bands of the aia telescope .",
    "in this first paper , we limited ourselves to isothermal plasmas and isothermal solutions .",
    "the case presented in section  [ sec:3bands ] demonstrates the existence of multiple solutions if the number of bands is limited either by design of the instrument or by lack of signal .",
    "however , since our method provides the respective probabilities of the multiple solutions , it is possible to properly interpret the solutions as compatible with several plasma temperatures . even if some of these properties have been illustrated in case studies , we provide here a systematic analysis of a wide range of plasma parameters .",
    "the computed distribution of squared residuals can be used to test the coherence of real aia data with the isothermal hypothesis .",
    "this type of analysis can also be help to determine the optimum data acquisition parameters for aia ( e.g. spatial binning and exposure time ) ensuring that no secondary solution is present . in section  [ sec:6bands ]",
    ", we showed that , with enough signal , the six aia coronal bands provide a robust reconstruction of isothermal plasmas with a temperature resolution comprised between 0.03 and 0.11 @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison with the three bands case gives a quantification of the improvement brought by the new generation of instruments .",
    "the same method can be applied to other instruments with different response functions and different numbers of bands or spectral lines .",
    "this naturally requires the computation of the corresponding probability matrices and distribution of residuals .",
    "the temperature resolution , and more generally the details of the probability matrices presented in sections  [ sec:3bands ] and  [ sec:6bands ] , depend on the amplitude and distribution of the random and systematic errors .",
    "we found the resolution to be proportional to the uncertainty level ( at 1  mk , @xmath122 ) .",
    "we simulated plasmas with high emission measures typical of active regions . depending on the temperature , either the photon noise or the uncertainties on the calibration and atomic physics dominate .",
    "the illustrated properties of the inversion , from the multiplicity of solutions to the temperature resolution , are thus driven by both random systematic errors . while the photon noise can be reduced by increasing the exposure time or binning the data , reducing the systematics",
    "requires better atomic data and photometric calibration , which is not trivial .",
