    "one of the most enduring problems in modern astrophysics is to explain how the million - degree solar corona is created and sustained .",
    "the corona is a highly non - uniform environment which reflects its magnetic structure and activity .",
    "for example , there are magnetically _ open _ and _ closed _ regions ; in open regions the field lines extend great distances into the heliosphere where they may reconnect with planetary magnetic fields , and in closed regions magnetic loops , line - tied at the solar surface and illuminated by plasma at euv and x - ray temperatures , are observed .",
    "quiet sun regions are associated with relatively weak magnetic fields , whereas active regions , which overlie the sunspots at the surface , have stronger magnetic fields and give rise to a great deal of dynamic and eruptive solar activity .",
    "the magnetic fields are strongest in active region cores , where temperatures can exceed 5  mk . regions of weaker magnetic field are generally associated with lower temperatures and it therefore seems clear that the heating rate must be in some way related to the magnetic field .",
    "the most obvious connection is through heating the plasma via the release of magnetic energy .",
    "this might occur by gradually stressing the magnetic fields threading the corona , building up the energy stored in the field , until the energy is released by reconnection leading to direct heating , bulk motion , and particle acceleration , the latter two ultimately being thermalized via collisional processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for example .",
    "alternatively , alfvn waves propagating along the field lines may interact , leading to energy release and dissipation via resonant processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite provides a more detailed discussion of these and other possibilities .",
    "unfortunately , direct observational signatures of coronal heating are extremely difficult to detect @xcite and so the actual mechanism which raises the coronal plasma to such tremendous temperatures has not yet been identified .",
    "nonetheless there are observational measurements that may provide information concerning the properties of the heating mechanism , such as the timescale over which the release and dissipation of energy must occur , which may in turn yield clues to the physical nature of the mechanism itself . one popular conception of coronal heating is to consider the manner in which a monolithic ( as observed ) coronal loop is heated ; if one assumes that the loop is composed of many thermally isolated , sub - resolution filaments , then the question to be answered concerns how each individual filament is heated .",
    "a single filament is understood to be the thinnest magnetic flux tube with an isothermal cross - section .",
    "there are two broad possibilities for the time - dependence of the heating mechanism for each filament ; either steady or impulsive . in the case of steady heating energy",
    "is released and dissipated at a more or less constant rate , and the mechanism operates for a period of time that is much longer than the cooling timescale . in the case of impulsive heating energy",
    "is released and dissipated on a timescale that is significantly shorter than the cooling timescale . in the former case the filament heats up and eventually reaches some new , hot , hydrostatic equilibrium . in the latter case",
    "the filament heats up and is then allowed to cool and drain .",
    "we will refer to impulsive heating events by the generic term _",
    "nanoflare _ , which is understood to mean any mechanism that gives rise to the impulsive release and dissipation of energy .",
    "an important parameter is the frequency with which nanoflares occur on the same filament .",
    "for example , if a filament is heated and then cools and drains , returning to its initial state before being re - heated , then we refer to this as _ low - frequency _ nanoflare heating",
    ". however , if a filament is heated and then re - heated just a short while into its cooling and draining phase , then we refer to this as _ high - frequency _ nanoflare heating .",
    "we note that steady heating is just the upper limit of high - frequency nanoflare heating , where the delay between successive nanoflares on a single filament is effectively zero .",
    "there has been a great deal of recent interest in one potential diagnostic of the frequency of occurrence of heating events in active region cores : the gradient or slope ( @xmath0 ) of the emission measure ( in @xmath3 space ) between the temperature of peak emission measure and 1  mk @xcite . of the active region cores analysed to date the observationally measured slopes are in the range @xmath4 .",
    "steeper slopes indicate a greater proportion of hot ( e.g. @xmath5  mk ) material relative to warm ( @xmath6  mk ) material and this is consistent with steady heating ( truly steady or high - frequency nanoflare heating ) . in this scenario",
    "most of the sub - resolution filaments are maintained at high temperatures , with relatively few cooling and draining ; consequently there is little warm material .",
    "shallower slopes indicate commensurately more equal proportions of hot and warm material , consistent with low - frequency heating . in this scenario",
    "the filaments are allowed to cool , with the result that there is more warm material than in the steady heating limit .",
    "recent work has focused on determining whether low - frequency nanoflares are consistent with the observed emission measure slopes and what the properties of the individual nanoflares ( e.g. volumetric heating rate , duration ) heating each filament must be , as well as the properties of the loops themselves ( e.g. initial conditions , length ) .",
    "@xcite found that neither low - frequency nanoflares nor steady heating could explain their observed emission measure slopes ( @xmath7 ) , though later observations yielded significantly shallower slopes ( @xmath8 : * ? ? ? * ) which were more consistent with low - frequency heating .",
    "steady heating led to effectively isothermal emission measures which severely underestimated the amount of warm plasma present , especially in diffuse regions where no discrete loops are observed .",
    "@xcite carried out several numerical experiments to study the emission measure slope in the case of heating by low - frequency nanoflares , focusing in particular on the influence of the radiative losses by using different abundance sets in their models .",
    "they found slopes in the range @xmath9 for photospheric abundances and @xmath10 for a coronal abundance set with an enhanced population of low first ionization potential ( fip ) elements ( e.g. iron ) .",
    "@xcite have also discussed the influence of radiative losses on the emission measure slope ; using the most recent atomic data they found steeper emission measure slopes below 2  mk , which they associated with enhanced cooling in the @xmath11  mk range .    in the present work we focus on the heating of active region cores by low - frequency nanoflares and",
    "carry out an extensive survey of the parameter space of possible heating events and loop properties .",
    "in particular , we consider the importance to the emission measure slope of the volumetric heating rate , the duration of the heating @xmath12 , the temporal envelope of the heating profile , the initial conditions in the loop ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and the loop length .",
    "we carry out extremely detailed forward modeling to produce synthetic spectra and use this to calculate the emission measure for each of our numerical experiments . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we describe our modeling approach and the experiments there were carried out .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ results ] and , finally , present a summary of our key results and a number of conclusions concerning heating by low - frequency nanoflares in section  [ summary ] .",
    "our approach to carrying out the numerical experiments and our forward modeling procedure are documented in detail in @xcite . however",
    ", we will provide a brief summary and then focus on what is new here .",
    "we have explored an extensive parameter space of coronal loop and low - frequency nanoflare properties that we believe may be representative of active region core heating , and we present the results from 45 model runs .",
    "a low - frequency nanoflare is defined such that : ( a ) the heating timescale is significantly shorter than the timescale required for the strand to reach a new hydrostatic equilibrium if the increased heat input had remained steady ; and ( b ) the time between each individual heating event on a single strand must be significantly longer than the cooling timescale following heating .",
    "the first five columns of table  [ table1 ] summarize the key loop properties and heating parameter values for each run .",
    "the first column indicates the number assigned to each run , which will be used to reference them as they are discussed in turn .",
    "the second column gives the loop length @xmath15 defined as the distance between the transition region foot - points along the loop .",
    "the computational domain also includes a deep ( many scale heights ) chromosphere at @xmath16 k that is attached to each transition region foot - point in order to provide a source of material to ablate into the corona upon heating and to maintain a stable atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the third and fourth columns describe the properties of the impulsive heating event . @xmath17 and @xmath12 are the peak volumetric heating rate and the duration of heating .",
    "the fifth column gives the total volumetric heating input @xmath18 .",
    "note that the temporal envelope of the heating profile can be square ( @xmath19 ) or triangular ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the first 14 entries in table  [ table1 ] correspond to the 14 numerical experiments that form the basis of @xcite and the remainder were conducted to substantially broaden the parameter space .       in summary ; we can use the loop length and the magnetic field strength to constrain @xmath18 and , of the components of @xmath18 , we can use @xmath21 to constrain @xmath17 and then @xmath22 yields @xmath12 .",
    "our studies show that the emission measure slope is essentially independent of the temporal envelope chosen for the heating and so @xmath12 is the key parameter . for low - frequency nanoflares",
    "we find predicted slopes in the range @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we can place limits on the slope that can be obtained in the case of heating by low - frequency nanoflares .",
    "the emission measure slope coolward of the peak is determined by the strands undergoing radiative cooling and enthalpy - driven draining .",
    "the emission measure in a particular temperature range depends upon two factors : ( a ) the density of the strands as they cool through that range ; and ( b ) the number of strands in that range .",
    "a characteristic emission measure can be calculated by weighting the density - dependent emission measure by the number of strands .",
    "since the number of strands in a particular temperature range depends upon how quickly the plasma cools through that range , @xmath24 , we can write                                                typical values of @xmath42 in the temperature range over which emission measure slopes are calculated are given by @xmath46 @xcite or @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "these yield @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath41 decreases with increasing loop length and to approach @xmath50 would require an unfeasibly long loop for our study .",
    "we are limited to loops of approximately 160  mm in total length to be consistent with active region core scales .",
    "table  2 of @xcite shows that @xmath51 , which yields @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the case of shorter loops table  2 of @xcite",
    "shows that @xmath54 , which yields @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we note that @xcite performed a related analysis and found that @xmath57 .    in consequence",
    ", we conclude that it is not possible for the low - frequency nanoflare scenario to yield emission measure slopes coolward of the peak that exceed these values of @xmath0 , depending upon the radiative loss function . in the case of @xmath58 , approaching @xmath59 would require loops of unphysical length for active region cores .",
    "this explains why our experiments are limited to slopes of about 2.6 , because the maximum length in our study is 160  mm ( @xmath60 for the values of @xmath42 considered ) .",
    "therefore , we determine that low - frequency nanoflares can not explain emission measure slopes in active region cores where @xmath61 .    a partial solution to the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently steep emission measure slopes with low - frequency nanoflares might be found from the super - position of coronal loops .",
    "consider a scenario in which a number of particularly long loops ( @xmath62  mm , for example ) cross the active region core along the observer s line - of - sight , but have foot - points located outside the core .",
    "the contribution to the emission measure of such loops might serve to raise the limit on @xmath0 due to their smaller values of @xmath41 , though they are still bound by the lower limit @xmath50 which yields @xmath63 less than the steepest slopes found by @xcite ( @xmath64 ) and @xcite ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "one might argue that the higher densities of short loops ( shorter than a gravitational scale height ) means they would make the dominant contribution to the line - of - sight emission and hence to @xmath0 , but their radiative lifetimes are also short meaning that fewer strands contribute to the emission in a given temperature range ( equation  [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we might expect long loops and short loops to have similar emission measures .",
    "we can resolve the question of which loops make the dominant contribution by noting that density is strongly dependent on length , and length only enters the weighted emission measure via the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "we have already demonstrated that @xmath63 is smaller for shorter loops and restricted to an upper limit , that lies below many observationally measured values , for longer loops .    in practical terms , then , it seems that to find slopes greater than 2.6 for current radiative loss calculations we must appeal to some other heating scenario .",
    "low - frequency nanoflares are one limit , where the time between heating events on a single strand ( the re - energization timescale ) is longer than the cooling  /  draining timescale .",
    "the opposite limit is steady heating , where the strand has no time to cool before the onset of the next heating event . in order to steepen the slope it is necessary to increase the amount of hot material in the region of @xmath21 relative to the amount of material near 1  mk . in the next paper of this series",
    "we will investigate repeating nanoflares on a single strand , where the re - energization timescale is less than the cooling  /  draining timescale , in order to determine whether this mechanism can maintain enough hot material , relative to cooler material , to explain the steepest observed slopes ( e.g. @xmath66 ) .",
