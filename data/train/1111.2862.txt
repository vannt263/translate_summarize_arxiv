    "it is now established that most bulge - dominated galaxies host central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and that galaxies frequently merge with one another . as a natural consequence",
    ", there must exist a subpopulation of galaxies that harbor two smbhs .",
    "these smbh pairs are observable if they are accreting gas as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , though some may be enshrouded by dust .",
    "the kiloparsec ( kpc ) scale separation dual agns are an intermediate evolutionary stage between the galaxy pairs separated by tens of kpc used as proxies for the merger rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the sub - pc separation binary smbhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) that are expected to produce gravitational waves upon coalescence .",
    "although there are thousands of known galaxy pairs with tens of kpc separations , only a handful of kpc - scale dual agns @xcite , one 100 pc scale agn pair @xcite , and one 10 pc scale agn pair @xcite have been confirmed .",
    "the small number of confirmed dual agns is in conflict with expectations based on the galaxy merger rate and the triggering of gas accretion onto smbhs during mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) . although discoveries of individual dual agn systems continue ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a systematic survey of dual agns is now necessary to close the gap between the observed and expected numbers .",
    "such a systematic survey of dual agns would shed light on drivers of galaxy evolution such as galaxy mergers and smbh growth . as direct observational tracers of galaxy mergers ,",
    "dual agns can be used to estimate the galaxy merger rate .",
    "further , the number of dual smbhs powering agns can set constraints on the activation probability of smbhs in merging galaxies , which is a key parameter in models of the growth of smbhs by gas accretion during galaxy mergers .    with the advent of large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies ,",
    "it is now possible to conduct a systematic census of dual agns .",
    "two dual agn candidates were identified in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey based on their long - slit spectra , which revealed two components of agn - fueled @xmath8emission separated by @xmath1kpc spatially on the sky and a few hundred km s@xmath9 in line - of - sight velocity @xcite .",
    "the velocity separations manifest as double - peaked emission lines in the one - dimensional spectra .",
    "however , the extreme rarity of double - peaked agns demands a larger survey for statistical studies .",
    "recently , 340 unique agns with double - peaked @xmath8were identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these are plausible dual agn candidates , but velocity offsets in agn emission lines can also be produced by narrow - line region ( nlr ) effects such as small - scale ( @xmath11 100 pc ) gas kinematics and outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) or larger - scale agn outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since sdss fiber spectra carry insufficient spatial information , spatially resolved follow - up slit spectroscopy is required to determine both whether the double - peaked emission lines come from spatially distinct regions and what the physical scales of the regions are .",
    "these observations will help constrain which physical mechanisms are producing the double - peaked agn lines and which objects are good candidates for dual agns .",
    "we have obtained follow - up long - slit observations of 81 ( or one - fourth ) of the double - peaked narrow - line agns in sdss using a combination of the kast spectrograph at lick observatory , the double spectrograph at palomar observatory , and the blue channel spectrograph at mmt observatory .",
    "since the orientation of the double emission components on the sky is unknown , we observe each object at two position angles , generally separated by 90@xmath12 , so that we can determine the full spatial separation of the two emission components on the sky as well as their position angle .",
    "we use this information , as well as the spatial extent of the emission and existing multiwavelength observations of the host galaxies , to constrain what mechanisms ( gas rotation , agn outflows and jets , or dual agns ) on what scales ( @xmath13 pc , @xmath1kpc , or @xmath110 kpc ) produce the line profiles , and to identify which objects are the best candidates for dual agns .",
    "we assume a hubble constant @xmath14 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 throughout , and all distances are given in physical ( not comoving ) units .",

    "we obtained long - slit spectroscopy of the 81 double - peaked agns using the kast spectrograph at the lick 3 m telescope ( pixel size @xmath25 ) , the double spectrograph ( dbsp ) on the palomar 5 m telescope ( pixel size @xmath26 for the red detector and @xmath27 for the blue detector ) , and the blue channel spectrograph on the mmt 6.5 m telescope ( pixel size @xmath28 ) .",

    "we observed each target twice , with the slit at two different position angles , in order to determine the orientation of the agn emission components on the plane of the sky .",
    "we typically made observations at the isophotal position angle of the major axis of the object in sdss @xmath21-band photometry and the corresponding orthogonal position angle .",
    "however , if the sdss imaging showed a companion near our target we aligned the position angle to include that companion rather than using the position angle of the galaxy , and at times mechanical constraints on the rotation of the telescope prevented us from observing at a second position angle that was orthogonal to the first .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures in iraf and idl .",
    "in this section we present measurements of the velocity offsets between the redshifted and blueshifted components of the double - peaked @xmath8emission lines in the sdss spectra .",

    "consequently , for completeness and consistency , we measure all of the velocity offsets from the sdss spectra here ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .    for each galaxy , we fit two gaussians to the continuum - subtracted @xmath8emission line profile , which is the emission line with the highest signal - to - noise ratio in our observations .",

    "for each two - dimensional long - slit spectrum , we determine the projected spatial separation between the two @xmath8emission features by measuring the spatial centroid of each emission component individually .",
    "we measure the spatial centroid of an emission component by first centering a 2 @xmath8 ( rest - frame ) wide window on the emission .",
    "next , at each spatial position we sum the flux , weighted by the inverse variance , over all wavelengths within the window .",
    "we place a 10 pixel window around the emission , and define the window s center to be the spatial position where the summed flux is maximum .",
    "we then fit a quadratic to the summed flux to locate a peak , define a narrow window centered on the peak flux , and compute the line centroid within this window .",
    "we derive the error on this spatial centroid by repeatedly adding noise to the spectrum drawn from a gaussian with the variance of the pixels in the window and redoing all centroid measurements .    for a given target ,",
    "we measure the projected spatial separation between the two @xmath8emission components at both position angles observed , and then combine the two spatial separations to yield the spatial offset between the two emission components on the sky and the position angle of their offset .",
    "if observations at position angles @xmath43 and @xmath44 yield spatial separation measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , then the true position angle @xmath47 of the two emission components on the sky is determined through the numerical solution of    @xmath48    with @xmath49 determined above , the spatial separation of the two emission components on the sky is then @xmath50 or equivalently , @xmath51 .",
    "we also classify by eye whether the agn emission components in the long - slit spectra are spatially  compact \" or  extended \" .",
    "we find that each emission feature displays two components , and if both components appear spatially distinct and compact at both position angles observed we label the object  compact \" . if one or both of the components appear spatially extended or diffuse at one or both position angles , we label the object  extended \" .",
    "this type of extended structure is known to be produced by gas kinematics , outflows , or jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though we note it could also be produced by dual agns where one or both of the agns also has visible emission from gas kinematics , outflows , or jets .    we find 47 spatially compact objects and 34 spatially extended objects , corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the sample , respectively .",

    "sections [ multiwavelength ] and [ unusual ] address other observations of our sample and some objects that we find have unusual long - slit spectra ; for results for the complete sample skip to section [ results ] .",
    "in an effort to classify the nature of the double - peaked @xmath8emission lines in sdss spectra , some authors have conducted follow - up observations of subsamples of these objects in optical , near - infrared ( nir ) , radio , and x - ray . these observations aimed to test the dual agn hypothesis by resolving systems with two agns or two stellar components , where the stellar components are presumed to be remnants of the progenitor galaxies from the merger that produced the dual agns . here",
    "we summarize these observations and their overlap with our sample ( see also table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .    the follow - up optical slit spectroscopy and nir imaging of 31 type 2 seyferts with double - peaked @xmath8@xcite includes 14 objects in our sample .",
    "none of our objects exhibit two stellar components in the nir imaging .",
    "however , in three of our objects we measure that the emission components in the long - slit spectra are separated by less than the @xmath52 spatial resolution of the nir imaging , such that stellar nuclei coincident with the emission components would not be spatially resolved in the nir imaging . in the remaining 11 objects , stellar nuclei that are spatially coincident with the double emission components could be resolved in the nir imaging , so either they have no secondary stellar component at these spatial separations , or the secondary stellar nucleus is obscured or too faint to be visible in the nir imaging .",

    "these ifu , ao , and _ hst _ observations include 34 objects in our sample , of which seven show double stellar components in ao .    although position angles between the stellar components are not reported in the literature @xcite , we estimate the position angles for these seven objects based on our best estimates of the bright centroid of each component in the published images . in section  [ ao ] , we compare these position angle estimates , as well as the reported spatial separations , to the position angles and spatial separations measured from our long - slit spectroscopy .    further , very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of 11 type 2 seyferts that have double - peaked @xmath8as well as faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ) detections reveal compact radio emission in only two objects @xcite . one ( sdss j151709.21 + 335324.7 ) of these two galaxies is part of our sample , and this galaxy also has a radio jet that suggests a radio jet - driven outflow produces the double - peaked @xmath8lines @xcite . none of the vlba observations show double radio cores ,",
    "although expanded very large array observations of another double - peaked agn ( not in our sample ) revealed two radio cores that confirmed it as a dual agn system @xcite .",

    "although this galaxy was classified as a double - peaked agn in @xcite , its spectra display triple - peaked narrow lines and single - peaked broad lines ( figure  [ fig : unusual_spectra ] , top ) , a line profile that could be explained by outflows or jets that affect the nlr only .",

    "the distribution of spatial separations indicates that the double - peaked agn emission lines are produced by @xmath1kpc - scale dual agns and/or @xmath1kpc - scale outflows , jets , or rotating gaseous disks , height=336 ]      for observations of this galaxy , we purposefully aligned one of the slit position angles ( @xmath55 ) so that it would include the nearby spiral galaxy to the southwest of the target ( figure  [ fig : unusual_images ] , middle ) .",
    "this spiral galaxy has photometric redshifts from sdss of @xmath56 ( measured with the template fitting method ) and @xmath57 ( measured with a neural network method ) , which are similar to the target galaxy s spectroscopic redshift @xmath58 .",

    "this is suggestive of the type of rich environment that we expect for dual agns , which are created from galaxy mergers .",
    "this galaxy has an interacting companion to the northwest ( figure  [ fig : unusual_images ] , bottom ) , and we aligned one of the slit position angles ( @xmath60 ) to include this companion",
    ". the long - slit spectra show emission features physically linking the two galaxies ( figure  [ fig : unusual_spectra ] , bottom ) , possibly indicating an inflow or outflow of gas between the two galaxies .",
    "this could be an indication of the triggering mechanism that funnels gas onto smbhs during galaxy mergers .",
    "we find that all of the double - peaked agns in our sample exhibit two spatially distinct agn emission components , with projected separations on the sky ranging from hundreds of pc to a few kpc ( the full range is 0.2 @xmath2 kpc @xmath3 5.5 @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "the median separation is 1.1 @xmath2 kpc , and the distributions of separations are similar for the subsamples with spatially compact and spatially extended emission components ( figure  [ fig : kpc_hist ] ) .",
    "we note that , given the 3@xmath31 diameter of an sdss fiber , emission components with separations @xmath61 ( which , for our highest - redshift object , corresponds to @xmath62 @xmath2 kpc ) will not fall within a single sdss fiber .",
    "the range of projected separations we measure indicates that the mechanism or mechanisms producing the double - peaked agn emission lines are neither a very small scale nor a very large scale effect .",
    "hence , the data are not explained by the rotation of gas in disks of sizes @xmath11100 pc , bulk flows of gas on small scales near the galaxy s center , small - scale outflows , or agn pairs or agn outflows with @xmath110 kpc separations .",
    "instead , the spatial separations we measure indicate that the double - peaked agn emission lines in our sample are produced by @xmath1kpc - scale dual agns and/or @xmath1kpc - scale outflows , jets , or rotating gaseous disks .    we note that @xcite identify 30 double - peaked agns with peaks that have symmetric profiles or are nearly equal in flux and suggest that they are the products of rotating gaseous disks .",
    "six of our objects are included in their sample of 30 : sdss j081542.53 + 063522.9 , sdss j084049.47 + 272704.8 , sdss j124813.82 + 362423.6 , + sdss j130724.08 + 460400.9 , sdss j171544.05 + 600835.7 ( which x - ray observations indicate is a dual agn system ; @xcite ) , and sdss j210449.13 - 000919.1 .",

    "the objects with spatially extended emission in the long - slit spectra ( open squares ) have a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0.34 ( where the significance level of its deviation from zero is 0.05 ) , suggesting they may be preferentially produced by agn outflows .",

    "these fractions are more than twice the expectation for a uniform distribution of @xmath63 between 0@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 , indicating that the double agn emission components are preferentially produced in the plane of the host galaxy.,height=336 ]",
    "the correlations between the projected physical separations and line - of - sight velocity separations of the double - peaked agns could help distinguish between different sources of the emission , since dual agns may exhibit different correlations than nlr kinematics in single agn .",
    "if a subset of our sample are dual agns , then the spatial separations and velocity offsets we measure are snapshots of the dual agn dynamics in the stages after the initial galaxy merger but before smbh coalescence . for a fixed , three - dimensional physical separation between dual agns , we might naively expect a larger ( smaller ) line - of - sight velocity for a larger ( smaller ) projected physical separation .",
    "when the orbiting dual agns are oriented almost along the line of sight , the projected physical separation will be small and the bulk of the velocity will be transverse , resulting in a small line - of - sight velocity measurement . in comparison , dual agns with a range of three - dimensional physical separations may wash out any relation between projected physical separation and line - of - sight velocity .",
    "a positive correlation between velocity and physical separation could also result from agn outflows , where a higher- ( lower- ) velocity outflow enables ionized gas to emit @xmath8out to larger ( smaller ) distances from the central agn . in contrast , the opposite correlation should occur for agn jets . if a jet is oriented almost along ( transverse to ) the line of sight , we should measure a large ( small ) line - of - sight velocity but a small ( large ) projected physical separation .    for the full sample , we plot the projected physical separations between the double @xmath8emission components seen in the long - slit spectra against the line - of - sight velocity separations between peaks in the double - peaked @xmath8emission lines in the sdss spectra , and we find that the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is 0.16 and the significance level of its deviation from zero is 0.15 ( figure  [ fig : kpcv ] ) .",
    "this significance level means that there is a 15@xmath24 probability of observing a correlation this strong or stronger in uncorrelated data purely by chance .",
    "however , the correlation strengthens to a spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0.34 ( significance 0.05 ) for the subsample with extended spatial emission and essentially disappears for the subsample with spatially compact emission ( correlation coefficient -0.04 , significance 0.77 ; see section  [ extent ] for a discussion of extended and compact emission ) .",
    "the physical separation - velocity relation thus seems to separate into two populations : the spatially extended agn systems and the spatially compact agn systems .",
    "the spatially extended agn population s correlation of increasing projected physical separation with increasing line - of - sight velocity is inconsistent with our expectations for agn jets .",
    "however , the correlation might be explained if the population s spatially extended emission features are preferentially produced by agn outflows .",
    "the correlation also matches that for dual agns at fixed , three - dimensional separations , but nlr effects would be necessary to explain the spatially extended emission .",
    "the spatially compact agn population s lack of correlation between projected physical separation and line - of - sight velocity could be explained by dual agns with a variety of three - dimensional physical separations .",
    "the spatially compact emission is consistent with the scenario of two compact agns with no extended nlr features .",
    "although the physical separation - velocity relations hint that the spatially extended agns may be preferentially produced by outflowing agns and the spatially compact agns may be preferentially produced by dual agns with a range of three - dimensional physical separations , we stress that additional observations are required for confirmation of dual agns and outflowing agns .",
    "further , the subpopulations of double - peaked agns with spatially compact or spatially extended emission are likely not clearly defined as the products of either dual agns or nlr kinematics , as the emission profile of a double - peaked agn could be produced by a combination of both effects .",
    "our measurements of the position angles of the double emission components can be used to determine their orientations in the host galaxies .",
    "we define @xmath63 as the difference between the isophotal position angle of the major axis of the galaxy ( which is determined from sdss @xmath21-band photometry ) and the position angle of the two agn emission components on the sky ( which we measure as @xmath49 in section  [ measure ] ) .",
    "however , the isophotal position angle of the major axis of the galaxy , and hence @xmath63 , is only a meaningful measurement in systems where the photometry shows the galaxy has some degree of ellipticity .",
    "consequently , we focus only on the 44 of the 81 galaxies in our sample that have ellipticities @xmath68 ( where ellipticities are computed in section  [ ellipticities ] ) .    for these 44 galaxies , we find that the position angle of the two agn emission components on the sky is often aligned with the isophotal position angle of the major axis of the object , such that the difference @xmath63 is close to zero ( figure  [ fig : kpctheta ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath7 ( 14 objects ) of the full sample of 44 galaxies , @xmath65 ( 7 objects ) of the subset with spatially extended emission , and @xmath66 ( 7 objects ) of the subset with spatially compact emission have @xmath63 values that are within a 3@xmath67 deviation from zero .",
    "these fractions are more than twice the expectation for a uniform distribution of @xmath63 : if the errors on @xmath63 remained the same but the @xmath63 values were distributed uniformly between 0@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 , only @xmath69 of the sample would have @xmath63 values within a 3@xmath67 deviation from zero",
    ".    expressed another way , @xmath70 of the 44 galaxies have @xmath71 , which is almost three times the expectation of @xmath72 for a flat distribution of @xmath63 between 0@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 .",
    "in addition , @xmath73 of the 44 galaxies have @xmath74 , which is more than twice the expectation of @xmath75 for a flat distribution of @xmath63 between 0@xmath12 and 90@xmath12 .",
    "alignment of the two agn emission components with the major axis of the object ( or low @xmath63 ) indicates that the emission is produced in the plane of the galaxy , which is consistent with emission produced by dual agns ( whose orbits are driven by the potential of the host galaxy and dynamical friction from the host galaxy stars ; in simulations , @xcite also see alignment of the dual agns with the ellipticities of the host galaxies ) and some agn - driven outflows and jets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . other agn - driven outflows and jets",
    "can be more orthogonal to the host galaxy plane , approaching @xmath76 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we do not anticipate many dual agns at these orientations . based on these expectations , low @xmath63 could be used as a selector for double - peaked agns that are , with additional follow - up observations , more likely to yield detections of dual agns than double - peaked agns with high @xmath63 .",
    "we also plot @xmath63 against the line - of - sight velocity separations between @xmath8emission components , but we find no significant correlation between them .      while all double - peaked agns can be considered candidate dual agns , we attempt to identify observational signatures that select the most promising candidates .",
    "we find that two spatially compact agn emission components , both emission components in the plane of the host galaxy , and two stellar nuclei spatially coincident with the two emission components may be indicators of dual agns . in this way , we can focus limited observational resources for follow - up on the double - peaked agns that are more likely to yield dual agn detections .",
    "we report these promising candidates in sections  [ plane ] and  [ ao ] , but definitive proof of dual agns requires the spatial resolution of x - ray or radio cores associated with each agn ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "since the dynamics of kpc - scale separation dual agns are dominated by the host galaxy potential and dynamical friction from the host galaxy s stars , dual agns should preferentially reside in the plane of the host galaxy . in section",
    "[ align ] , we used this expectation to identify 14 promising dual agn candidates that have double optical agn emission components oriented in the plane of the host galaxy , where the difference in position angles @xmath63 are within 3@xmath67 deviations from zero .",
    "these 14 candidates include seven double - peaked agns with spatially extended emission ( sdss j084049.47 + 272704.8 , sdss j095207.62 + 255257.2 , sdss j160524.59 + 152233.5 , sdss j163316.03 + 262716.3 , sdss j210449.13 - 000919.1 , sdss j225510.12 - 081234.4 , sdss j230442.82 - 093345.3 ) and seven double - peaked agns with spatially compact emission ( sdss j011659.59 - 102539.1 , sdss j080418.23 + 305157.2 , sdss j093024.84 + 343057.3 , sdss j102325.57 + 324348.4 , sdss j144804.17 + 182537.9 , sdss j162939.58 + 240856.0 , sdss j225420.99 - 005134.1 ) .",
    "the seven double - peaked agns with spatially compact emission may be the most promising dual agn candidates of the 14 , since we showed in section  [ xvrelation ] that spatially compact systems may be preferentially produced by dual agns .      of the seven double - peaked agn in our sample that exhibit double stellar components in ao imaging ( section  [ multiwavelength ] )",
    ", we find that three ( sdss j095207.62 + 255257.2 , sdss j115523.74 + 150756.9 , and sdss j123915.40 + 531414.6 ) have double agn emission components with spatial separations and position angles comparable to the spatial separations and position angles between the double stellar components in the corresponding ao image ( figure  [ fig : dual_candidates ] ) . in each case",
    ", the spatial separations are consistent to within our 1@xmath67 errors and the position angles are consistent to @xmath77 , suggesting that the double agn emission components are likely coincident with the double stellar components .",
    "this scenario is a signature of a late - stage galaxy merger in which the stellar remnants of the original progenitor galaxies accompany the two agns as they evolve into a kpc - scale pair .    consequently , these galaxies are three of the most compelling dual agn candidates in our sample",
    ". one of these , sdss j095207.62 + 255257.2 , was also identified as a dual agn candidate by @xcite and @xcite , who both deem it a confirmed dual agn system based on integral - field spectroscopy that shows agn emission coincident with double stellar components in the ao imaging . while double stellar nuclei coincident with double optical or near - infrared agn emission components is strong evidence for dual agns , such a configuration could also be explained by a single agn between the two continuum sources .",
    "in addition , dual agns may not always have double stellar components visible in ao , as is the case for two systems that are strong dual agn candidates based on x - ray and other observations but exhibit only a single source in ao imaging @xcite . in cases like these",
    ", the second stellar component could be hidden by dust obscuration or could be too faint to be within the detection threshold . while the three galaxies discussed here are good candidates for dual agns , additional follow - up observations",
    "are required to confirm or refute them as dual agns .",
    "+   +    we note that sdss j123915.40 + 531414.6 is an unusual case because the two emission features corresponding to the double peaks in the sdss spectrum have a significantly smaller spatial offset ( 1.3 @xmath2 kpc , or 0@xmath7839 ) than the spatial offset between the two stellar components visible in the ao image ( 4.1 @xmath2 kpc , or 1@xmath7824 ; @xcite ) . instead",
    ", we find a third emission component ( labeled b in figure  [ fig : dual_candidates ] , bottom ) between the blueward ( labeled a ) and redward ( labeled c ) features corresponding to the double peaks .",
    "this third emission component has a spatial offset ( @xmath79 @xmath2 kpc , or @xmath80 ) and position angle ( @xmath81 ) relative to the blueward component that is consistent with those of the double stellar components .",
    "note that there is also a fourth emission component ( labeled d ) , visible only in the two - dimensional spectrum taken at position angle @xmath82 , that is @xmath83 from the target galaxy s stellar continuum and may be reflective of an outflow .",
    "the long - slit and ao observations of sdss j123915.40 + 531414.6 suggest it might host a triple agn system or a dual agn system with outflows .",
    "we have obtained follow - up long - slit spectroscopy of 81 double - peaked narrow - line agns in sdss at @xmath0 with lick , palomar , and mmt observatories .",
    "the purpose of these observations was to obtain spatial information about the sources of the agn emission , to aid in distinguishing whether the double - peak morphologies are a result of dual agns , rotating gas in a disk , or agn jets and outflows and on what physical size scales .",
    "we measure the projected spatial separation and position angle of the double agn emission components on the sky , and compare to the orientation of the host galaxy in sdss photometry as well as multiwavelength observations of the double - peaked agns .",
    "our main results are summarized below .",
    "\\1 . in all of the 81 double - peaked agns",
    "we observe , the long - slit spectra reveal double agn emission components with projected separations on the sky of 0.2 @xmath2 kpc @xmath3 5.5 @xmath2 kpc ( median @xmath84 @xmath2 kpc ; figure  [ fig : kpc_hist ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the double - peaked agn emission lines in our sample are produced neither by very small - scale gas rotation and outflows nor by @xmath110 kpc scale agn pairs or outflows . instead , our observations are consistent with the double agn emission components originating in @xmath1kpc - scale dual agns or @xmath1kpc - scale outflows , jets , or rotating gaseous disks .",
    "the double - peaked agns can be divided into two populations : those with double spatially extended emission components whose line - of - sight velocity differences increase with projected physical separation on the sky ( 34/81 , or @xmath6 of our sample ) and those with double spatially compact emission components whose line - of - sight velocity differences are independent of projected physical separation ( 47/81 , or @xmath5 of our sample ) .",
    "the physical separation - velocity trends shown in figure  [ fig : kpcv ] suggest that the spatially extended sample may be preferentially produced by agn outflows ( since higher - velocity outflows can produce @xmath8emission at larger distances ) and the spatially compact sample may be preferentially produced by dual agns with a range of actual three - dimensional separations . consequently , we suggest that double - peaked agns with double , spatially compact emission components may be fruitful targets for dual agn searches .    \\3 . in @xmath7 of the objects in our sample",
    ", we find that the orientations of the double agn emission components on the sky align with the major axis of the host galaxy , such that the differences @xmath63 are within a 3@xmath67 deviation from zero ( figure  [ fig : kpctheta ] ) .",
    "this result is more than double the expectation ( @xmath69 ) for a uniform distribution of @xmath63 .",
    "since dual agns should orbit in the plane of the galaxy , small @xmath63 could be a useful indicator for promising dual agn candidates .",
    "our proposal of small @xmath63 as an indicator for dual agns is supported by simulations that show a strong alignment between the orientations of dual agns and the major axis of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "we identify 17 particularly promising dual agn candidates for follow - up observations .",
    "fourteen double - peaked agns ( listed in section  [ plane ] ) have double agn emission components in the long - slit spectra that are oriented in the plane of their host galaxies , as expected for dual agns . in an additional three double - peaked agns ( listed in section  [ ao ] and shown in figure  [ fig : dual_candidates ] ) , the spatial offset and position angle we measure between the double agn emission components are consistent with the spatial offset and position angle between the double stellar components in ao imaging .",
    "this suggests that the double agn emission components may be coincident with the double stellar components , which is a scenario expected for dual agns .",
    "while the one - dimensional spectra of double - peaked agns alone do not reveal much about the sources of the emission , we have shown that the spatial information about the emission provided by follow - up long - slit observations can help distinguish between between gas rotation , agn outflows and jets , and dual agns on different physical scales . in this way , long - slit observations enable identification of the most compelling dual agn candidates for confirmation via x - ray or radio observations that spatially resolve two agns .",
