    "since the sobol indices can be interpreted as the contribution of each parameter to the variance of @xmath18 , we can thus see that a large part of the variance of @xmath18 is explained by the infection rate per infected partner alone , with a sobol index of 0.59 , and by the transition rate from a fibrosis score of f0/f1 to a score of f2/f3 , with a sobol index of 0.31 .",
    "other parameters contribute only marginally , and particularly linkage to care / loss to follow - up rate , which represent only 4% of the whole variance , according to these results .",
    "+ with the tornado diagram ( obtained in @xcite ) , the most sensitive parameters are the infection rate per infected injecting partner , the transition rate from a fibrosis score of f0/f1 to a score of f2/f3 and the combination of the linkage to care / loss to follow - up rate ( which were varied together to estimate the impact of the uncertainty about the linkage to care of pwid )",
    ". + the sobol indices and tornado diagram indicate the same two first factors ( infection rate per partner and transition rate from f0/f1 to f2/f3 ) that can impact @xmath18 . the tornado diagram , which explores a much smaller region of the parameter space by the way it is constructed , detects more noisy contributions for the other factors .",
    "the latter appear in the tornado in groups that corresponds to similar sobol indices ( linkage to care / ltfu rates , average time to diagnosis and cessation , relative risk of infection , mortality , f2/f3@xmath214f4 ) .",
    "the order of these groups is by decreasing values of the sobol indices .",
    "sensitivity analysis is a key step in modelling studies , in particular in epidemiology . models often have a high number of parameters , which are often seen as degrees of freedom to test scenarii and take into account several interplaying phenomena and factors ... the computation of sobol indices can indicate , among a long list of input parameters , which ones can have an important impact on the outputs .",
    "the classical estimators , like the jansen estimator , require a large amount of requests to the function @xmath22 that generates the output from the inputs .",
    "the reason is that the sobol indices are approximated , in these cases , by quantities involving imbricated sums where parameters vary one by one .",
    "+ the literature on sensitivity analysis focuses on outputs that depend deterministically on the inputs . when there is randomness , it is natural to propose new approximations based on non - parametric estimations that require a lower number of calls to @xmath22 since information brought by simulations with close input parameters can also be used .",
    "no meta - model is requested . numerical study on toy models",
    "show that these estimators can also be used in deterministic settings too .",
    "+ the two estimators that we study are based on two non - parametric regression models : nadaraya - watson regression and wavelet decomposition . for both of them",
    ", we demonstrated that the mse shows an elbow effect . on numerical toy examples",
    ", we obtained a better mse with these estimators than with the jansen estimator of same complexity .",
    "while the estimator using nadaraya - watson seems easier to calibrate , the wavelet regressions are justified as soon as there is a high frequency phenomenon in play .",
    "moreover , when well - calibrated they can overcome some smoothing biases that can appear when the output is very noisy , which is the case in epidemic scenarii where there can be either large outbreaks or quick extinction due to stochasticity , for example .",
    "we follow the scheme of the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite .",
