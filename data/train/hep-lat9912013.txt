    "the talk i delivered at this workshop had substantial overlap with talks i gave at lattice99 @xcite and at chiral99 @xcite . to avoid repetition , this write - up",
    "is restricted to technical points which were neither covered orally , nor in the above mentioned written contributions .",
    "i shall show explicitly how the main formulae one finds today in papers touting a `` new approach '' to the regularization of chiral gauge theories @xcite are directly and straightforwardly derived from the overlap .",
    "thus , there really is no `` new '' approach and there are fewer new results than a superficial reading of the above papers would indicate . whether one likes to start from the ginsparg - wilson @xcite relation or from the overlap one arrives at the same algebraic setup .",
    "the gw relation , by itself , does not guarantee the right dynamics , and one needs to fulfill extra side conditions in order to really get chiral fermions @xcite .",
    "the gw relation became fashionable in january 1998 .",
    "the overlap dirac operator first appeared in @xcite ( posted july , 1997 ) and its connection to the gw relation was pointed out in @xcite ( posted october , 1997 ) .",
    "this write - up consists of a collection of formulae related to overlap chiral fermions on the lattice with their derivations ; each derivation amounts to a little exercise in linear algebra and is quite trivial .",
    "my main objective in putting this summary in print has been stated in the abstract . to be sure ,",
    "let me add that _ some _ new results have indeed been obtained recently : during the last two years a certain amount of progress has taken place on the mathematical question of fine tuning the phase of the overlap to eliminate small gauge breaking effects when anomalies cancel .",
    "our focus is on lattice dirac fermions defined on a four dimensional hypercubic lattice in a background of @xmath0 lattice gauge fields .",
    "these fermions live in a finite complex vector space of even dimension @xmath1 .",
    "elements in this space will be denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "components of these vectors will labeled by combined indices , @xmath3 , with the convention @xmath4 , where @xmath5 label sites , @xmath6 group indices and @xmath7 spinor indices .",
    "operators will be represented by matrices with matrix indices appearing as subscripts .",
    "if only site indices appear the group and spinor indices are to be understood as suppressed .",
    "trace operations either operate on all indices ( @xmath8 ) or only on a restricted set , typically excluding sites ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition to square matrices we shall often employ rectangular ones , dimensioned as ( number of rows ) @xmath10 ( number of columns ) .",
    "two main reflection operators act on the vectors @xmath2 : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "a reflection is a unitary - hermitian operator .",
    "equivalently , one can think about the associated projectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 as fundamental .",
    "the kato @xcite pair @xmath15 and @xmath16 is algebraically characterized @xcite by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where the anticommutator can be viewed as a version of the ginsparg - wilson relation , or a lattice version of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "a central role is played by the overlap dirac operator @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "nothing of principle is lost by setting @xmath20 .",
    "some trivial identities are listed below : @xmath21 in the above one can replace @xmath22 by @xmath23 when the inverse exists .",
    "similar equations , up to signs , are obeyed by @xmath24 .",
    "another trivial identity is @xmath25 . from it",
    "one derives @xmath26 and similarly @xmath27 the inverse of the overlap dirac operator obeys : @xmath28 the last expressions obviously anti - commute with @xmath12 and are anti - hermitian .",
    "a second quantized notation will also be employed when appropriate : we imagine dealing with a system of @xmath1 noninteracting fermions represented by a @xmath29 dimensional fock space .",
    "the elements making up the fock space are superpositions of anti - symmetrized direct products of single particle states obtained using any basis of the original complex n - dimensional space one chooses .",
    "one assumes a standard basis relatively to which standard fermionic creation / annihilation operators @xmath30/@xmath31 are defined .",
    "to distinguish vectors in the fock space from vectors in other spaces we shall use dirac bra - ket notation for second quantized states only .    in the overlap one needs to fill all the negative energy states of @xmath11 .",
    "they generate @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath11 depends on the gauge fields @xmath33 and so do the orthonormal vectors @xmath34 .",
    "similarly one introduces @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . appending a prime",
    ", similar objects are introduced for @xmath12 , but now there is no gauge field dependence and @xmath37",
    ". the dirac sea state corresponding to occupying all @xmath34 single fermion states will be denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "it is convenient to collect all the vectors @xmath34 into an @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 and do the same for similar collections of vectors .",
    "then : @xmath41    starting from identities like @xmath42 we get : @xmath43",
    "pauli s statistics for fermions implies @xmath44 this is the overlap and gives the lattice chiral fermion determinant . by convention , it is associated with right handed weyl fermions ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the inverse of @xmath46 is @xmath47 because @xmath48 .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 can be rewritten in an artificial way to look dependent also explicitly on the overlap dirac operator : @xmath49 the equation holds by taking the factors @xmath12 and @xmath11 in @xmath50 to act left and right respectively .",
    "this is equation ( 18 ) in @xcite .",
    "it is strange that the simpler overlap form is never even mentioned in @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 is not directly equal to the r - fermion propagator , @xmath52 . unlike @xmath46",
    ", @xmath52 is an operator on the original vector space .",
    "since it represents the propagation of @xmath45-weyl fermions but acts in a space that accommodates dirac fermions it is appropriately rank deficient . in the overlap construction ( equation ( 5.19 ) in @xcite ) the propagator is found to be @xmath53 when it exists , @xmath52 has rank @xmath54 and is given by @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 @xmath57 the last expression is equation ( 17 ) in @xcite , but @xmath58 is simpler .    the formula @xmath59 is important because it makes it explicit that @xmath52 transforms covariantly under gauge transformations .",
    "this covariance is self - evident in the second quantized expression in terms of operators .",
    "thus , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a wilson line operator connecting sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 acts only on spinorial indices , is gauge invariant although @xmath65 is generically not . in this aspect",
    "the overlap is different from earlier attempts to put chiral fermions on the lattice , break gauge invariance and restore it subsequently by gauge averaging . in the overlap gauge averaging",
    "can not destroy the perturbative masslessness of the fermions , so , for instance , the counter example of testa @xcite does not apply .    for @xmath66-fermions",
    "we introduce @xmath67 with inverse @xmath68 and propagator @xmath69 , obtained by reversing the signs of @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath70 to better match continuum properties @xcite we define the overlap chiral external propagators @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to replacing @xmath73 by @xmath74 in the second quantized formula ( equation ( 5.22 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "one can take an @xmath45-@xmath66 combination to propagate with @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 anti - commutes with @xmath12 ; however , @xmath77 does not .",
    "the fermion determinant in the vector - like case is @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath79 @xmath80 = e^{\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty { 1 \\over m } \\tr [ p^\\prime ( 1-p)]^m } = \\det [ 1-p^\\prime ( 1-p)].\\ ] ] similarly , one shows @xmath81 @xmath82=\\det [ 1-p(1-p^\\prime)]= \\det [ 1-(1-p^\\prime ) p ] .\\ ] ] comparing the matrix elements between the bases @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the above combinations of projectors with those of @xmath50 we obtain @xmath85 since @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the propagator on internal fermion lines is given by @xmath88 .",
    "only on external fermion lines can one use @xmath89 and preserve na \" i ve chiral symmetry exactly @xcite .",
    "to get currents one computes the first order variation of the chiral determinant with respect to the gauge fields .",
    "the precise form of the variation ( @xmath90 ) is not important here .",
    "the variation can be naturally ( geometrically ) decomposed into two terms @xcite .",
    "@xmath91 to isolate the dependence on the phase choice for @xmath92 into the local last term .",
    "the main point is that because of the phase ambiguity the component of @xmath93 along @xmath92 is not determined by @xmath94 but @xmath95 is . the first term , being phase choice independent can be made to transform covariantly under gauge transformations with an appropriate choice of the variation @xmath90 .",
    "this term is nonlocal in gauge fields and defines the covariant current .",
    "the sum of both terms is also a current and , assuming a single valued ( as a function of the gauge background ) choice of the second quantized states @xmath92 has been made , gives the consistent current with an appropriate choice of @xmath90 .",
    "the difference , denoted by @xmath96 in the continuum @xcite , is the last term .",
    "this last terms is recognized as the berry connection @xcite : under a change of phase @xmath97 it changes additively by @xmath98 , but it contains invariant information in associating a berry phase @xmath99 with every closed contour @xmath100 in gauge field space .",
    "let us now translate back to first quantized language : @xmath101 for simplicity , we assume @xmath102 ( which also implies @xmath103 ) .    the variation of @xmath104 is just @xmath105 which is equal to : @xmath106 the last term can be rewritten as @xmath107 leading to an expression for the covariant current : @xmath108 one should not forget however that @xmath109 is not @xmath110 .",
    "the above equation contains formula ( 21 ) in @xcite . in second quantized notation",
    "we have : @xmath111 so , all we calculated is the bilinear numerical kernel giving the current operator associated with varying the fermion induced effective action in second quantized language . actually , the second quantized form is advantageous in topologically nontrivial backgrounds .",
    "there , to make the expression meaningful one needs to insert some operator of the t hooft vertex type in the numerator ( the denominator is `` canceled '' by the fermion determinant factor ) . thus one can consider correlators between t hooft vertices and covariant currents .    to get the covariant anomaly we choose the variation to be an infinitesimal gauge transformation with parameters @xmath112 at site @xmath62 where @xmath113 labels the @xmath114 hermitian generators @xmath115 acting on the fermions which are in a representation ( possible reducible ) @xmath116 .",
    "the site diagonal matrix @xmath117 represents the transformation in fermion space .",
    "thus , @xmath118 $ ] , reflecting the covariance of @xmath22 .    starting from @xmath119 h^{-1 }",
    "p^\\prime =   $ ] @xmath120 we obtain for the covariant anomaly : @xmath121 in the equations above the tracelessness of @xmath12 in spinor space was used .",
    "the anomaly @xmath122 can also be trivially rewritten as @xmath123 this is equivalent to equation ( 24 ) in @xcite ( there is a factor of two difference stemming from the choice in @xcite to write the gw relation as @xmath124 rather than the overlap form @xmath125 ) . the anomaly equation is meaningful even when @xmath50 is not invertible .    the topological charge @xmath126 in the overlap has been long known @xcite to be given by @xmath127 . since @xmath128 we see the expected relation between the anomaly and the index .",
    "we already introduced berry s connection @xmath129 . under a phase change",
    "@xmath130 @xmath131 , but the associated ( abelian ) berry curvature @xmath132 is unaffected @xcite : @xmath133 the phase freedom of the second quantized state @xmath38 amounts to an arbitrary _ unitary _ @xmath134 rotation among the first quantized states making up the dirac sea . @xmath135 @xmath136 hence @xmath137 , and the rest of @xmath134 is irrelevant .",
    "the intrinsic meaning of berry s curvature is made explicit by expressing it in terms of the projectors only .",
    "the relevant formula is well known @xcite and has been used in @xcite .",
    "start from @xmath138 and expand the right hand side into a sum of four terms .",
    "three of them are symmetric in the @xmath139 indices and the one which is not is @xmath140 . observing that @xmath141",
    "is also symmetric we can replace every @xmath142 by a term @xmath143 , obtaining @xmath144.\\ ] ] this formula , with projectors in the reflections stead , is eq ( 3.21 ) in @xcite .",
    "let us now choose explicit formulae for the variations .",
    "we parameterize the group by real coordinates @xmath145 , so there is one set of @xmath146 for every link : @xmath147 , with the summation convention acting on @xmath148 .",
    "one would rather use vector fields with nicer transformation properties than those of @xmath149 . focusing for the moment on a single copy of the group we opt to use the",
    "globally defined left invariant vector fields @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath151 vector fields represent the lie algebra ( with real structure constants @xmath152 ) acting on the group manifold : @xmath153 = f_{ab}^c i_c ( \\xi ) $ ] .",
    "the main point about the introduction of the real matrix @xmath154 @xcite is that , for an arbitrary group element parameterized by @xmath155 , @xmath156 , we have : @xmath157 this proves that for any two fixed group elements @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath160 showing that gauge transformations act linearly on the covariant currents defined below .",
    "let @xmath161 with @xmath162=f_{ab}^c \\delta_{xy } \\delta_{\\mu\\nu } \\e_c ( x,\\mu ) $ ] .",

    "the above reduces to equation ( 8.1 ) in @xcite .",
    "the gauge group @xmath170 with fermions in non - integral representations is an interesting case because one can take the basic vector space over the reals @xcite .",
    "this makes berry s connection and curvature vanish ; still the state @xmath92 has a sign ambiguity - the @xmath171 bundle of the complex case has been replaced by a @xmath169 bundle . if the @xmath169 bundle is twisted ( like a m \" obius strip ) , one can not find a single valued smooth definition for the states @xmath92",
    ". if one could , the signs of all @xmath92 s would be determined by smoothness up to an irrelevant overall sign .",
    "then , lattice gauge transformations , which can always be smoothly deformed to the identity , could not induce sign changes and the chiral determinant would be gauge invariant .    in the continuum witten @xcite has shown that a gauge invariant formulation for representations @xmath172 is impossible because the space of _ gauge orbits _",
    "( unlike the space of gauge fields ) is multiply connected : there are two classes of closed curves and the chiral determinant when taken round a curve in the nontrivial class can change sign , so is not single valued , making a gauge invariant formulation impossible . a nontrivial curve is obtained from an open path connecting a gauge field configurations to its gauge transform by a gauge transformation which can not be smoothly deformed to unity , and subsequently going to orbit space .    although witten s anomaly is reproduced on the lattice @xcite , the realization can not be by exactly the same mechanism as in the continuum because on the lattice the space of all gauge transformations over the torus is connected ( any lattice gauge transformation can be smoothly deformed to unity ) , while in the continuum it is not and this is the heart of the matter @xcite .",
    "the space of gauge orbits is multiply connected also on the lattice , but this time as a consequence of the space of gauge fields itself being already multiply connected ( unlike in the continuum ) as a result of a necessary gauge invariant excision of backgrounds where @xmath11 can not be unambiguously defined @xcite .",
    "it is well known that berry s phase @xcite is captured by adiabatic hamiltonian evolution .",
    "the quantum mechanical adiabatic theorem states that in the adiabatic limit hamiltonian evolution can be replaced by a geometric evolution with an operator introduced by kato @xcite over forty years ago .",
    "the geometric evolution amounts to parallel transport with berry s connection @xcite . considering a path in gauge field space parameterized by @xmath173",
    "this parallel transport means @xmath174 where we assumed @xmath175 and the dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath176 .",
    "if we set @xmath177 , where the `` time '' argument identifies a gauge field configuration , adiabatic evolution means that at all @xmath176 @xmath178 will be equal to @xmath179 up to phase , the phase of @xmath178 being fixed relatively to that of @xmath179 by the above law of parallel transport .      similarly , observing that @xmath201 , we get @xmath202 \\det { \\cal o}_v ( t),\\ ] ] which is equation ( 31 ) in @xcite .      as long as we focus only on one open path there is no fundamental distinction between @xmath179 and @xmath178 .",
    "but , when we recall the environment in which the path is embedded , it is clear that the states @xmath179 come from a single valued function on the entire space of gauge fields .",
    "the state @xmath178 typically does not return to its initial value when transported round a _ closed _",
    "path @xmath100 in gauge field space .",
    "the extra phase it acquires is berry s phase @xmath203 .",
    "if @xmath204 for any closed curve @xmath100 in gauge field space , a natural global phase choice would be to parallel transport by berry s connection from one fixed point in field space . since the exact structure of the reflection @xmath11 is not important for the continuum limit , but does determine @xmath99 , it is natural to search for a deformation of @xmath11 ( `` improvement '' ) so that @xmath204 for all closed curves @xmath100 .",
    "it can be shown that _",
    "it is impossible _ to find such a deformation if continuum perturbative anomalies _ do not cancel",
    "it is conjectured that if anomalies cancel and the above obstruction is removed a deformed @xmath11 with @xmath205 exists and would permit a gauge invariant phase choice by berry s law of parallel transport @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the above conjectures are compatible with continuum : there , nonabelian anomalies cancel iff one can make the conserved and covariant currents identical , in other words when @xmath96 can be made to vanish . in the overlap framework the role of @xmath96 is played by berry s connection and this motivates the conjectures .",
    "when anomalies do not cancel , the inevitability of nontrivial berry phases was established in @xcite by exhibiting a class of backgrounds on a torus _ in gauge orbit space _ over which berry s curvature generated a two form which was well defined but integrated to a non - zero integer .",
    "the result was in agreement with known continuum formulae for @xmath96 @xcite . in the continuum , once @xmath96 is known ( including normalization ) , the anomalies themselves ( both consistent and covariant ) are completely determined .",
    "the idea to add two continuous directions ( in the case of @xcite these were the two torus coordinates ) to produce integrands that integrate to integers ( which can be non - zero if anomalies do not cancel , as was found in @xcite ) is at the core of section 9 in @xcite .",
    "all recent algebraic relations are identities directly obtainable from the basic overlap formulae .",
    "the one new idea is an approach to look for a gauge variant local functional to be added to the phase of an assumed given smooth section of the initial @xmath171 overlap bundle so that gauge invariance holds when anomalies cancel .",
    "the new approach is an alternative to the older proposal of @xmath206 and mathematically differs in replacing the geometrical framework of @xcite by one based on analysis .",
    "although both approaches include some fine tuning , in @xmath206 the fine tuning is at the level of gauge covariant operators only .",
    "space limitations prevent further discussion .",
