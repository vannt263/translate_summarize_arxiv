    "recently , studies on the semileptonic @xmath10 decays into excited charmed mesons become interesting in both experimental and theoretical sides . experimentally , to precisely measure the branching ratios of the semileptonic @xmath10 meson into the groundstate charmed mesons , it also needs to measure precisely the branching ratios of the semileptonic @xmath10 decays into excited charmed mesons which is the main backgroud for the former decays .",
    "theoretically , it provides additional modes for testing the validity of effective theories , in particular , how good of the spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "the semileptonic @xmath10 decays into excited charmed mesons have been discussed in @xcite based on the framework of the usual heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "where the dependence of decay rates on wave functions was presented in a general form , the authors mainly deal with isgur - wise type function and the @xmath2 order wave functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 which arise from the effective currents .",
    "the wave functions @xmath13 arising from the chromomagnetic term in lagrangian have been neglected , and those arising from the kinematic term in lagrangian have been absorbed into the isgur - wise type function and not been considered separately . the detailed field theoretic calculations on these decays were presented in @xcite , where the isgur - wise type function and @xmath11 , @xmath12 have been evaluated by using the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the transitions between ground and excited state heavy - light mesons within the framework of heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft)@xcite in which both quark and antiquark effective fields with keeping quark - antiquark coupled terms have been considered . in particular , we focus on the semileptonic b decays into the @xmath14 charmed meson doublet ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the spin and parity of the light degrees of freedom in the charmed mesons .",
    "it has been shown that the hqeft can provide a consistent description on both exclusive @xcite and inclusive @xcite decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "it has been seen in these references that the hqeft has many advantages with respect to the usual hqet . in the new framework ,",
    "the values of @xmath17 extracted from both exclusive and inclusive decays show a good agreement ; the bottom hadron life time ratios can be well understood ; @xmath2 order corrections at zero recoil in both exclusive and inclusive decays automatically absent without imposing the equation of motion @xmath18 when the physical observables are presented in terms of heavy hadron masses ; less wave functions are needed ; and there are interesting relations among meson masses and transition wave functions at zero recoil . in the most recent paper @xcite , the decay constants and binding energy of ground state heavy - light mesons as well as transition wave functions among them were studied consistently by using qcd sum rule approach in the framework of hqeft .",
    "it was noticed that the hqeft appears much more reliable than the usual hqet in describing the decays and transitions for the ground state mesons .",
    "particularly , the @xmath2 corrections to the heavy - light meson decay constants were found to be much smaller than the heavy quark mass , so that the scaling law of the decay constants is only slightly broken .",
    "this observation is unlike the usual hqet , which may lead to either the complete break down of the @xmath2 expansion @xcite or a large @xmath2 correction @xcite in evaluating the decay constants .",
    "two transition wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the @xmath2 order have also been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "their zero recoil values agree with those extracted from the ground state meson masses .",
    "our present paper is organized as follows . in sec.[formulation ] , the weak transition matrix elements relevant to @xmath21 decays are studied up to the order of @xmath2 and parameterized by independent universal wave functions . the form factors and decay rates",
    "are then given in terms of those wave functions .",
    "the relevant normalization of the excited mesons is also discussed . in sec.[sumrule ] , using the appropriate interpolating currents for excited heavy mesons , we derive the sum rules for two of the important wave functions concerned at @xmath2 order , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in sec.[analysis ] , we present our numerical results obtained from the sum rule approach .",
