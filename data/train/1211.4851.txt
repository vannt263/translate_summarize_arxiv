    "<S> we verify the extraordinary transmission enhancement and collimation induced by the material loss in anisotropic near - zero permittivity ( enz ) metamaterials , and reveal the physical mechanism of this exotic electromagnetic phenomenon via the iso - frequency contour ( ifc ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate the possibility in realization of such loss enhanced transmission of gaussian beam in realistic silver - germanium multilayered structures by applying full - wave numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , metamaterials with near - zero permittivity ( epsilon - near - zero , enz ) emerge into the focus of the extensive explorations in both theory and engineering due to their anomalous electromagnetic features at microwave and optical frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> enz metamaterials have been widely used in lots of exciting applications , such as directive emission @xcite , electromagnetic energy squeezing and tunneling @xcite , electromagnetic wave phase front shaping @xcite , electromagnetic transparency @xcite , and invisible cloaking @xcite . in the previous work , </S>",
    "<S> it was shown theoretically that in enz media loss can induce transparency , omni - directional collimation , and transmission enhancement due to the interplay between enz and material loss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic loss can even improve the propagation of oblique incident beams @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we verify such abnormal transmission enhancement in anisotropic enz metamaterials with full - wave numerical simulations together with the iso - frequency contour ( ifc ) analysis , and demonstrate the possibility in experimental realization of this phenomenon by using silver - germanium multilayered structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of a plane electromagnetic wave incident upon the flat interface ( along the @xmath0-direction ) between air and an anisotropic enz metamaterial is considered in two - dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity of air is set to be unity , and the principle components of the permittivity tensor for the anisotropic enz metamaterial are denoted as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity @xmath1 is also set to be unity , i.e. , @xmath3 , while the permittivity @xmath2 reads @xmath4 with a near - zero real part @xmath5 and a non - zero imaginary part @xmath6 ( the material loss ) . </S>",
    "<S> regarding a plane electromagnetic wave in tm polarization ( with non - zero field components @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) , the dispersion relation of the anisotropic enz metamaterial reads @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is the wave vector in free space . </S>",
    "<S> the wave vector component @xmath12 is real and determined by the incident wave , while @xmath13 is complex and it is denoted as @xmath14 , with the imaginary part @xmath15 representing the propagation loss . </S>",
    "<S> the iso - frequency contours ( ifcs ) of the anisotropic enz metamaterial can be plotted based on the dispersion relation in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig1 ] displays three different ifcs at the frequency of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) corresponding to different values of permittivity @xmath2 , which has the same real part of @xmath18 , but different material losses : the low loss @xmath19 ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] ) , the moderate loss @xmath20 ( fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , and the high loss @xmath21 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the ifc of @xmath22 is plotted as red solid curve , while the ifc of @xmath23 is plotted as red dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> the circular ifc of air with radius @xmath11 is also plotted as blue solid curve for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the incoming electromagnetic wave in air is represented by the wave vector @xmath24 and the poynting vector @xmath25 , while the electromagnetic wave inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial is represented by the wave vector @xmath26 and the poynting vector @xmath27 . as a particular example , @xmath24 and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> are marked as the incoming electromagnetic wave in air has an incident angle of @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that for the low loss @xmath19 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , the ifc of @xmath22 forms a hyperbolic - like shape , with a very narrow opening toward the @xmath13-direction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the direction of the transmitted power inside the enz varies from normal to nearly parallel to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the high propagating loss , represented by the ifc of @xmath23 prevents the electromagnetic wave from transmitting inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial even at small incident angles . finite element method ( fem ) full - wave simulations are used to illustrate the wave propagation behavior , where a tm polarized gaussian beam is applied to mimic the experimental condition instead of the ideal plane electromagnetic wave . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian beam is represented by the distribution of the @xmath9 component . </S>",
    "<S> four different angles of incidence are calculated , including @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath30 , and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results clearly indicate that for all these angle of incidence , the incoming gaussian beam can not couple into and transmit in the anisotropic enz metamaterial , but reflect back at the interface , which is consistent with the above ifc analysis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a low loss of the anisotropic enz metamaterial along the @xmath31-direction will prevent the transmission due to impedance mismatch . as the material loss is increased to the moderate loss @xmath20 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , the opening of the ifc of @xmath22 toward the @xmath13-direction becomes wider , leading to a flatter curvature . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the corresponding propagating loss for the oblique incidence also decreases due to the increased material loss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , because of the flatter curvature of the ifc of @xmath22 , the incoming electromagnetic wave with small angle of incidence , e.g. , less than @xmath28 , will transmit inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial with the direction nearly normal to the interface , since the poynting vector of the electromagnetic wave should be perpendicular to the ifc of @xmath22 . in the simulations , the gaussian beam can transmit into the anisotropic enz metamaterial with a wide range of the angles of incidence from @xmath29 to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worth noting that the propagation distance of the gaussian beam inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial is limited by its propagation loss , especially for the gaussian beam with large angle of incidence , which is indicated in the ifc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the simulations also show that the wave propagation direction ( indicated by the poynting vector @xmath27 ) of the gaussian beam inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial is different from the direction of its phase velocity ( indicated by the wave vector @xmath26 ) , due to the anisotropic permittivity profile . for the high loss @xmath21 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] , the ifc of @xmath22 becomes almost flat straight lines , which allows the electromagnetic power inside the enz to propagate in the normal direction for a wide range of the incidence angle , for example , the gaussian beam with @xmath32 angle of incidence shown in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively low propagation loss permits a long propagation distance of the transmitted electromagnetic wave inside the anisotropic enz metamaterial . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission is enabled and enhanced by the high loss of the anisotropic enz metamaterial along the @xmath31-direction .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the effective medium theory @xcite , we numerically demonstrate this exotic electromagnetic phenomenon with realistic metal - dielectric multilayered structures , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic enz metamaterial is constructed as a multilayer consisting of alternating thin layers of silver and germanium stacking in the @xmath0-direction . in order to reduce the reflection at the interface </S>",
    "<S> , the multilayered stack is placed on a germanium substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of each sliver - germanium pair ( along the @xmath0-direction ) is @xmath33 , and the effective permittivity of the stack can be represented as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the filling ratio of the silver . </S>",
    "<S> the permittivity of the silver follows the simple drude model @xmath36 with permittivity constant @xmath37 , plasma frequency @xmath38 , and damping rate of bulk silver @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional factor @xmath40 in the simple drude model is used to account for the increased loss due to surface scattering , grain boundary effects in the thin silver film and inhomogeneous broadening in the realistic experiment @xcite . in the simulation , three different values of factor @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> are considered , including @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , which results in three different damping rates : @xmath44 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) , @xmath45 ( fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , and @xmath46 ( fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the permittivity of germanium is @xmath47 @xcite , and the enz frequency , at which @xmath48 , is designed at @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , thus based on eq .   </S>",
    "<S> the filling ratio of the silver is @xmath49 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) , @xmath50 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) and @xmath51 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] ) , with respect to the different damping rates . </S>",
    "<S> a tm polarized gaussian beam at the enz frequency @xmath16 is considered in the simulation , and two angles of incidence , @xmath52 and @xmath29 , are calculated for each damping rate . since lower damping rate leads to smaller material loss @xmath53 along the @xmath31-direction in the multilayered stack , it is clear that the gaussian beam almost can not couple into the silver - germanium multilayer stack and propagate inside for both angles of incident , although there is some optical scattering along the interface due to the layered structures . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is worth mentioning that the gaussian beam splitting phenomenon shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] inside the multilayered stack is caused by the optical nonlocality in enz metamaterials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the damping rate increases , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] , more energy of the gaussian beam can enter into the stack for both angles of incidence , especially for the lower angle of incidence , resulting in a clear demonstration of the loss enhanced transmission in realistic metamaterial structures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the simulation results also indicate that the gaussian beam propagates inside the multilayered stack normal to the interface between the stack and germanium substrate , which agrees well with the above analysis .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have verified the extraordinary transmission enhancement and beam collimation caused by the material loss in anisotropic enz metamaterials through numerical simulations , and explained this phenomenon by applying the ifcs of anisotropic enz metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also revealed the possibility in experimental realization of this phenomenon by using silver - germanium multilayered structures , which will stimulate experimental efforts to fabricate such anisotropic enz metamaterials and characterize this exotic optical phenomenon .    </S>",
