    "the following steps have been taken in generating and analyzing the sirtf images .",
    "the galaxy population in these images was generated in clusters with redshifts ranging from 0 to 10 .",
    "clusters were assumed to form with an exponential distribution of formation times having a mean time of formation corresponding to @xmath3 in an @xmath4 , @xmath5 cosmology .",
    "the density of galaxies has been increased slightly over the value given by schechter in order to match cowie s deep k - band counts .",
    "luminosities and colors evolve using bruzual @xmath1-models with a @xmath1 that depends on galaxy type .",
    "stars were added to the images using the populations used by elias .",
    "brown dwarfs are also included , but because we have assumed only old cold brown dwarfs ( @xmath6 ) , none of the detected sources were brown dwarfs .",
    "of the 32 stars in the field brighter than 0.1 @xmath1jy at 4.7 @xmath1 m , 6 are brown dwarfs , but the brightest is just fainter than the 4.7 @xmath1 m flux limit at 0.6 @xmath1jy .",
    "its 8 @xmath1 m flux is 1.5 @xmath1jy which is under the 8 @xmath1 m limit as well .",
    "note that the color is redder than any of the galaxies that we do detect .",
    "galaxy spectra are based on the spectral energy distributions for ellipticals and spirals by marcia rieke , which were combined with various weights to match bruzual @xmath1-models in the optical .",
    "this allowed us to include the broad ir features due to the h@xmath2 opacity minimum .",
    "this peak at 1.6 @xmath1 m rest wavelength can be seen in the bluing of the 4.7:8 @xmath1 m color at @xmath7 .",
    "800@xmath8800 pixels images covering 5.3333@xmath9 were generated , and then convolved with the sirtf beam .",
    "we assumed the diffraction limit of an 85 cm telescope with a 30% linear obscuration . in order to not exceed the sirtf specification of 50% encircled energy in a 2@xmath10 diameter circle",
    ", this diffraction - limited beam was further convolved with a 1.657@xmath10 fwhm gaussian .    these 800@xmath8800 pixel images with 0.39@xmath10 pixels",
    "were then made into 256@xmath8256 pixel images with 1.17@xmath10 pixels by summing 3@xmath83 blocks of pixels .",
    "this array was sub - stepped across the field in a 3@xmath83 pattern giving a final picture with 768@xmath8768 pixels of size 1.17@xmath10 on 0.39@xmath10 centers .",
    "noise was added to each pixel in this image , using the following noise levels : 3 @xmath1 m , 20.4 njy , corresponding to 2500 seconds ; 4.7 @xmath1 m , 74 njy , corresponding to 2500 seconds ; 6.2 @xmath1 m , 155 njy , corresponding to 10,000 seconds ; and 8 @xmath1 m , 217 njy , corresonding to 10,000 seconds .",
    "because of the 3@xmath83 substepping , a total of 9 frames at each wavelength are needed , giving a total exposure time of 22500 + 22500 + 90000 seconds or 1.6 days for the image shown .",
    "the first step after getting the 3@xmath83 sub - stepped images is to smooth with a 3@xmath83 box .",
    "these images were written out as fits files and displayed by saoimage .",
    "the rgb image was created using a fortran program to convert the intensities into a ppm ( portable pixel map ) file which was converted into a jpeg file using xv , and then printed to a hp deskjet 1200c printer using adobe photoshop .",
    "prints were also obtained using a kodak xl 7700 dye sublimation printer and a polaroid palette film recorder .",
    "the 8 @xmath1 m image was analyzed first .",
    "a baseline was subtracted from the frame .",
    "the level was chosen by finding the smallest range of values that covered 1/4 of the pixels in the frame , and then taking the mean of this range .",
    "this is an approximate way to find the mode of an image .",
    "with the baseline subtracted , a 7 pixel ( 2.73@xmath10 ) diameter circle was scanned across the image .",
    "places where the flux within this circle reached a local maximum over at least a 5@xmath85 pixel square , and with fluxes greater than 3 @xmath11 above the baseline , were identified as 8 @xmath1 m sources and listed .",
    "this list was then truncated at 2 @xmath1jy total flux , yielding 346 sources .",
    "a similar list was constructed at 4.7 @xmath1 m , truncated at 2/3 @xmath1jy total flux .",
    "the source positions found from the 8 @xmath1 m image were replaced by the closest source position from the 4.7 @xmath1 m image in order to get better centroids from the higher snr 4.7 @xmath1 m image .",
    "the flux within a @xmath12 diameter circle was then found in the 3 images at 3 , 4.7 and 8 @xmath1 m , giving the observed colors of the sources .",
    "the ratio of the flux within a 5 pixel ( @xmath13 ) circle to the flux contained within @xmath12 was taken on the 4.7 @xmath1 m image in order to see if source size could be used to separate stars from galaxies using the sirtf beam .",
    "finally we have used the extra knowledge that comes from controlling the simulations to generate three more data per source .",
    "a noiseless 4.7 @xmath1 m image was generated using the same beam convolution and smoothing , as well as a noiseless image of redshift times 4.7 @xmath1 m flux . from these images",
    "we generate the noise - free flux in a 7 pixel circle , @xmath14 $ ] , the noiseless @xmath15/f[2.73^{\\prime\\prime}]$ ] ratio , and the noiseless @xmath16 ratio , which gives us the mean redshift of the light seen in @xmath12 diameter circle centered on the source .",
    "looking at these mean redshifts for the stars in the image suggests that there is about ( 0.5 @xmath1jy)*(@xmath17 unit ) of redshifted 4.7 @xmath1 m flux in the @xmath12 aperture .",
    "thus these images are pushing the confusion limit .",
    "the sirtf image quality is marginal for discriminating between galaxies and stars . the low-@xmath17 clump of sources with high @xmath15/f[2.73^{\\prime\\prime}]$ ] ratios are stars , but several galaxies have higher ratios and thus appear more compact than some of the stars .",
    "fortunately almost all the faint sources in a high latitude deep survey will be galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts using colors out to @xmath18 m appear to be reliable .",
    "there are 40 galaxies with @xmath0 in the sample of 346 sources . sorting the 346 sources by 4.7:8 @xmath1 m color , the 41 reddest sources contain 39 out of these @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the 4.7:8 @xmath1 m color redshift diagram appears to be saturating at @xmath19 .",
    "the 3:4.7 @xmath1 m color saturated at @xmath7 and then became bluer for higher redshifts , so the longer wavelength data is needed for reliable photometric redshifts at high @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath20 sirtf field of view , showing the 8 @xmath1 m image as red , the 4.7 @xmath1 m image as green , and the 3 @xmath1 m image as blue .",
    "the same region with detected sources color coded by redshift .",
    "dark blue for @xmath21 , light blue for @xmath22 , green for @xmath23 , orange for @xmath24 , and red for @xmath25 . a color - color plot showing the 3:4.7 and 4.7:8 colors in magnitudes ( relative to @xmath26 = constant ) for the detected sources , color coded by redshift .",
    "dark blue for @xmath21 , light blue for @xmath22 , green for @xmath23 , orange for @xmath24 , and red for @xmath25 .",
