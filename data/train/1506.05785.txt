    "let @xmath5 be the group @xmath2 ( or @xmath20 ) . in this paper , we study efficient approximations of elements of @xmath5 by different universal subsets of @xmath5 . in the subject of quantum computing ,",
    "this problem arises naturally in the theory of efficient approximations of quantum gates , the elements of @xmath5 .",
    "we refer the reader to [ n ] and the many references cited therein for a comprehensive account of the subject of quantum gates and the larger subject of quantum computing .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",

    "more precisely , the outline of the paper is as follows .      in this section ,",
    "we review briefly the subjects of classical bits and quantum bits .",
    "classical bit _ is a basic unit of information in classical computing , with two possible states , 0 or 1 .",
    "there is an analogous concept to the classical bit in quantum computing , the _ quantum bit _ or _",
    "qubit_. the states of a qubit are represented using _",
    "dirac notation _",
    ", @xmath95 ; the two states are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , called the _",
    "basis states_. different from classical bits , a qubit can be in a state other that @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "when we measure the state of a qubit , we get @xmath98 with probability @xmath100 , and @xmath99 with probability @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "a qubit is a linear combination of states , often called superpositions , denoted by @xmath103 :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 , and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , a qubit s state is a unit vector in @xmath106 .",
    "a _ quantum gates _ are the quantum computing s equivalent to a classical computing s logic gate .",
    "it is an operation that acts linearly on a qubit .",
    "since qubits can be represented as unit vectors in @xmath106 , quantum gates can be thought of as linear maps from @xmath106 to @xmath106 .",
    "for example ,    @xmath107    is a 1-qubit quantum gate .",
    "because it must be linear , a quantum gate can be represented by a matrix with complex coefficients . for a single qubit ,",
    "it is a @xmath108 matrix . because qubits must be unit vectors , the results of applying a quantum gate to a qubit ,",
    "must also be a unit vector .",
    "this implies that the matrix representing a quantum gate must be unitary .",
    "thus , @xmath20 represents all possible quantum gates that act on a single qubit up to some unimportant constants .",
    "when working with complex space , for a @xmath110 , define @xmath111 as the matrix obtained by transposing and then complex conjugating @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "then , a @xmath113 matrix @xmath86 is called _ unitary _ if it satisfies the condition    @xmath114    all unitary matrices in @xmath115 form a group called _ unitary group _ , denoted by @xmath109 :    @xmath116    for example , @xmath117 , since @xmath118 , and @xmath119      a @xmath113 matrix @xmath86 is called _ special unitary _ if it is a unitary matrix with @xmath121 . then , all special unitary matrices form a group called _ special unitary group _ denoted by @xmath120    @xmath122    for example , to find the general form of a @xmath113 matrix @xmath123 , let @xmath124 .",

    "that is @xmath128 .",
    "hence ,    @xmath129    hence , for @xmath126 , @xmath86 is in the form of    @xmath130    where @xmath131 .",
    "if we set @xmath132 and @xmath133 , then the matrix @xmath86 becomes ,    @xmath134    since @xmath131 , we have    @xmath135    then , @xmath136 is a point on the unit 3-sphere in @xmath137 .",
    "hence , each @xmath138 corresponds to a point @xmath136 on @xmath15 .",
    "this is a bijective and continuous map .",
    "hence ,    @xmath139      recall that the @xmath142 of a group @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath143 , is defined as the set of elements which commute with all elements of the group :    @xmath144    the _ projective unitary group _ , denoted by @xmath140 is defined as the unitary group @xmath109 quotient by its center :    @xmath145    similarly , the _ projective special unitary group _ , denoted by @xmath141 is defined as the unitary group @xmath120 quotient by its center :    @xmath146    to find the relation between @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we need to consider the second isomorphism theorem .    _",

    ", 1-qubit quantum gates can be represented by the group @xmath1 ( or @xmath20 ) up to some unimportant constants .",
    "hence , the problem of constructing an efficient universal subset of quantum gates can be reduced to finding an efficient universal subset of @xmath5 .",
