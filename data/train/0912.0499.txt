    "the disentanglement between perturbative and non perturbative effects in qcd has been a major enterprise in the last three decades since the sum rules technique was first suggested  @xcite .",
    "while short distance radiative corrections are perturbatively computable and are characterized by a smooth logarithmic dependence on the relevant energy scale , non perturbative effects manifest as a stronger power - like dependence and in terms of vacuum expectation values of local and low dimensional gauge invariant operators .",
    "although the underlying quark - gluon dynamics should determine the relative strength of perturbative and non perturbative contributions unambiguously , up till now these condensates have been treated _ de facto _ as independent parameters , unrelated to the first few terms of the perturbative series . during many years",
    "renormalons have been viewed as a bridge between perturbative and non perturbative physics  ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a review ) . in a recent paper narison and zakharov  @xcite",
    "have conjectured a quite different scenario , namely a duality between condensates and perturbative contributions .",
    "this duality concerns the properties of large order perturbative series which involves an expansion in the strong running coupling constant @xmath0 , and it establishes that they are dual to non perturbative power corrections , i.e. powers of @xmath1 . at the practical level , this means that if one considers a short perturbative series then one should add the leading power correction by hand .",
    "only when one uses long perturbative series there is no reason to add power corrections .",
    "the confirmation of this conjecture might pave the way for practical approaches where condensates are required ; the need of allowed and forbidden local condensates would be justified because of a lack of a complete perturbative series to all orders .",
    "this is quite timely since in many applications at zero temperature and finite temperature the phenomenological need for power corrections involving dimension-2 operators is overwhelming .",
    "the zero temperature example _ par excellence _ is given by the heavy @xmath2 potential , where the string tension , a dimension-2 object not related to any local gauge invariant operator , appears as the unequivocal signal of confinement .",
    "there have been speculations on the appearance of dimension 2 contributions to the average plaquette  @xcite .",
    "recent lattice calculations  @xcite computing the average plaquette in lattice field theory up to 20-th order do not yet see the onset of renormalon physics ; a mild geometric type perturbative series which successfully reconstructs the full result , is observed instead .",
    "while high momenta at zero temperature probes the theory in the asymptotically free region , we note that a parallel discussion for finite temperature @xmath3 above the deconfinement phase transition might be carried out .",
    "however , the explicit breaking of lorentz invariance triggered by the privileged heat bath reference frame makes the theoretical discussion much more involved  @xcite . at finite temperature",
    "the recent discovery of inverse temperature power corrections from relatively old lattice data becomes evident from plots in @xmath4 and has been quite impressive and rather unexpected .",
    "they can effectively be explained by a dimension two condensate , starting from the polyakov loop  @xcite , the heavy quark - antiquark free energy in  @xcite as well as the trace anomaly and qcd equation of state in  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of course",
    ", it would be quite interesting to determine whether these thermal power corrections are dual , in the sense of narison and zakharov , to a long perturbative series .",
    "the present paper addresses this important issue .",
    "while the duality conjecture might eventually be tested more convincingly in the future , we suggest an alternative approach where some quantitative insight may also be gathered both at zero and finite temperature from confronting current lattice and perturbative results .",
    "basically , the idea is quite simple . given that the only scale entering the perturbative series to any order is @xmath5 , in a fit to lattice data containing _ both _ perturbation theory and condensates we should observe 1 ) smaller contributions from condensate at increasing perturbative orders and 2 ) a rather strong statistical correlation between @xmath6 and the dimensionful condensates .    in the present paper",
    "we pursue this idea to check with the accessible theoretical information and lattice data the validity of the duality conjecture . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qqpot ] we deal first with the more familiar quark - antiquark potential at zero temperature , where we indeed observe , within uncertainties , the expected correlations .",
    "this not only supports the perturbative - power duality but also qualifies the correlation method as a handy tool to study the duality elsewhere .",
    "we are interested to do so at finite temperature above the deconfinement phase transition for the polyakov loop in section  [ sec : polyakov_loop ] and the trace anomaly in section  [ sec : trace_anomaly ] . as a useful guideline we use the finite temperature model where",
    "non perturbative thermal power corrections are driven by a dimension 2 gluon condensate in the dimensionally reduced theory  @xcite .",
    "while the model might be improved , taken at face value it provides a unified and coherent description of gluodynamics lattice data using the _ same _ values of condensates within estimated errors .",
    "it therefore provides an ideal playground to search for possible correlations in the sense of the above mentioned duality .",
    "our points are best exemplified with the ( zero temperature ) heavy quark - antiquark potential within a perturbative expansion for which many efforts have been devoted . nowadays",
    "the perturbative series are partially known up to order @xmath7 in the weyl or temporal gauge , @xmath8 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in either case",
    "it is known that this perturbative computation can only reproduce lattice data at small separations , and fails for @xmath9 .",
    "the cornell potential is a phenomenological version of this potential and it gives a good overall description of the lattice data  @xcite for all separations .",
    "it reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the qcd coupling constant , which is considered as a constant , i.e. no running , and @xmath12 is the string tension term .",
    "the coulomb term corresponds to the leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "the linear term follows from quarkonium phenomenology , and it is widely accepted that it can not follow from a perturbative computation .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the perturbative potential is not complete , and should be extended with a linear term put by hand , i.e. @xmath13 because the accepted separation between perturbative and non perturbative contributions , one is tempted to identify the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in this section",
    "it will be shown that this identification might not be correct , in line with ref .",
    "@xcite , and in fact there is a mixing between power - like corrections and the perturbative series .",
    "this means that eventually @xmath16 . in order to provide further convincing evidence that this might happen",
    ", we will analyze lattice data for the heavy @xmath2 potential from ref .",
    "@xcite using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cornell ] ) and ( [ eq : vqqpert ] ) .",
    "two kinds of fits are considered . in the first ones ,",
    "a distance interval is sought where the perturbative expansion works well .",
    "as expected , this corresponds to taking a sufficiently small distance region , namely , @xmath17 .",
    "this regime follows from the requirement that the fitted @xmath14 is compatible with zero within errors .",
    "the second type of fits use all distances of lattice data , @xmath18 . in both cases an additive constant",
    "is allowed in the potential , chosen so that the fit reproduces exactly a point of lattice data at an intermediate distance @xmath19 .",
    "it has been checked that the conclusions are unchanged when this parameter is also included in the fit .    .",
    "fit , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : vqqpert ] ) , of heavy @xmath2 potential lattice data from ref .",
    "the fit is performed in the interval @xmath20 for the tree level , and in the full interval of lattice data , @xmath21 , for the rest .",
    "the intervals are chosen so that @xmath22 . at three level",
    ", the correlation coefficient refers to @xmath23 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a large correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or @xmath5 ) is found even at 1-loop order .",
    "in addition , the effect of a smaller contribution from @xmath24 at increasing perturbative orders is rather clear in the htl scheme .",
    "once again , the correlation between dimension 2 and dimension 4 condensates turns out to be strong .",
    "is confirmed when other lattice data are used  @xcite , but this result seems to be anomalous in view of table  [ tab : anomalyhtl1 ] . nevertheless at this order a high correlation between @xmath26 and @xmath25 , @xmath27 , is found . ]",
    "we have proposed to study statistical correlations between perturbative series and power corrections when analyzing lattice qcd results as a way to probe quantitatively the duality proposed by narison and zakharov in ref .",
    "we have found that the effects of this duality start feeling at leading order in perturbation theory , because even at this order the correlations are very strong .",
    "we have performed an analysis for the heavy @xmath2 potential at zero temperature , and for several observables in the deconfined regime of thermal qcd , for which power corrections were derived in previous works . as a byproduct",
    ", we have addressed the important question on the finding of inverse power corrections at finite temperature above the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "our analysis dissolves the apparent contradiction between the real existence of thermal @xmath4 power corrections in the lattice results and the persistent failure of perturbation theory to a given finite order to reproduce them ; these two extremely disjoint scenarios are actually complementary and strongly interrelated .",
    "the present correlation study can be extended to other cases where the condensate - perturbative duality might be expected .",
    "a very extreme situation corresponds to just use power corrections and no perturbation theory at all .",
    "this could be considered the starting point of the analysis , where some `` non perturbative '' physics would be expected .",
    "another extreme situation requires a complete knowledge of perturbation theory to all orders , a certainly unrealistic situation .",
    "for the situation in - between note that to observe a decreasing condensate for increasing orders in perturbation theory it is not at all trivial as it depends on the behavior of the perturbative expansion . on the other hand , _ showing _ that the residual condensate actually vanishes when _ all _ terms in perturbation theory are taken into account seems to us as difficult as solving qcd exactly ."
