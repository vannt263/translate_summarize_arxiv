    "for the general case of @xmath1 transition into a combination of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) states one can write the sk , sno cc and sno nc rates as r^el_sk & = & f_b p_ee + f_b r p_ea , [ two ] + r^cc_sno & = & f_b p_ee , [ three ] + r^nc_sno & = & f_b ( p_ee + p_ea ) , [ four ] where @xmath16 and @xmath31 denote the probabilities folded with the detector response function @xcite and averaged over energy . to extract a model independent bound on @xmath16 one has to ensure an equality of the response functions which amounts to slight adjustment of the sk threshold energy and the rate @xcite .",
    "our approach is slightly different .",
    "we treat @xmath16 to be effectively energy independent .",
    "the sk spectrum data indicates a flat probability down to 5 mev @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by sno @xcite which now has a threshold of 5 mev for kinetic energy of the observed electron .",
    "hence we consider this assumption as justified and expect the results to be insensitive to the differences in the response functions .",
    "it should be noted here that in cotrast to the sno cc events their nc events correspond to a neutrino energy threshold of 2.2 mev .",
    "however it is clear from eq .",
    "( 5 ) that for a @xmath1 to @xmath28 transition there is no reason to expect any energy dependence in @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand for the general case of @xmath1 transition into a combination of @xmath28 and @xmath30 our approach effectively assumes @xmath33 to be energy independent down to 2.2 mev .",
    "a comparison of the current values @xmath19 with @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it constitutes a 5.3@xmath34 signal for transition to a state containing an active neutrino component or alternatively a 5.3@xmath34 signal against a pure sterile solution .",
    "next we consider the general case where @xmath1 goes to a mixed state = @xmath35",
    ". then one can write @xmath36 ) . substituting this in the equations ( [ two ] ) and ( [ four ] ) and eliminating @xmath16 using equation ( [ three ] )",
    "one gets the following set of equations for @xmath24 and @xmath37 @xcite ^2(f_b - r^cc_sno ) & = & ( r^el_sk - r^cc_snc)/r , [ five ] + ^2(f_b - r^cc_sno ) & = & r^nc_sno - r^cc_sno .",
    "[ six ] we treat @xmath37 as a model parameter . and for different input values of @xmath37 we determine the central value and the @xmath38 and @xmath39 ranges of @xmath24 by taking a weighted average of the equations ( [ five ] ) and ( [ six ] ) .",
    "the corresponding curves are presented in fig .",
    "2 . combining the 2 @xmath34 lower limit of @xmath24 from this fit with the @xmath39 upper limit from the ssm ( vertical lines )",
    "gives a lower limit of @xmath37 @xmath40 0.45 i.e. the probability of the active component is @xmath40 45% .",
    "note that there is no upper limit on this quantity - i.e. the data is perfectly compatible with @xmath1 transition into purely active neutrinos .    assuming transition into purely active neutrinos ( @xmath41 ) we show in fig .",
    "3 the @xmath38 and @xmath39 contours in the @xmath42 plane from the combinations sk+snocc and sk+snocc+snonc .",
    "the inclusion of the nc rate narrows down the ranges of @xmath24 and @xmath16 .",
    "the error in @xmath24 after the inclusion of nc data is about half the size of the corresponding error from ssm as is seen from fig .",
    "in this section we present the results of our @xmath43 analysis of solar neutrino rates and sk spectrum data in the framework of two flavour oscillation of @xmath1 to an active flavour .",
    "we use the standard techniques described in our earlier papers @xcite excepting for the fact that instead of the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath19 we now fit the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0 flux normalisation gets cancelled from these ratios and the analysis becomes independent of the large ( 16 - 20% ) ssm uncertainty associated with this .",
    "we include in our global analyses the 1496 day sk zenith angle spectra @xcite .",
    "since we use both sk rate and sk spectrum data we keep a free normalisation factor for the sk spectrum .",
    "this amounts to taking the information on total rates from the sk rates data and the information of the spectral shape from the sk spectrum data .",
    "the sno cc and nc rates have a large anticorrelation .",
    "we have taken into account this correlation between the measured sno rates in our global analyses .",
    "further details of this fitting method can be found in @xcite . in table 2",
    "we present the best - fit parameters , @xmath45 and goodness of fit ( gof ) .",
    "the best - fit comes in the high(lma ) region as before @xcite .",
    "however as is seen from fig .",
    "4a the incorporation of the nc data narrows down the allowed regions , and in particular the low region becomes much smaller .",
    "we have also performed an alternative @xmath43 fit to the rates of table 1 @xcite along with the 1496 day sk spectra @xcite , keeping @xmath24 as a free parameter . even though we allow @xmath24 to vary freely the nc data serves to control @xmath24 within a range determined by its error . as we see from table 2 and fig . 4b",
    "the results of this fit are very similar to the previous case .",
    "the best fit comes from the high(lma ) region , while no allowed region is obtained for the low solution at the 99% cl level .",
    "maximal mixing is seen to be disallowed at the @xmath3 level . to illustrate the impact of the nc rate on the oscillation solutions we have repeated the free @xmath24 fit without this rate .",
    "the results are shown in fig 4c .",
    "evidently the nc data plays a pivotal role in constraining the oscillation solutions , particularly in the low / qvo region , which is allowed only at the @xmath3 level .",
    "it puts an upper bound on the @xmath46 in the lma region and rules out maximal mixing .",
    "the first sno nc data constitutes a 5.3@xmath34 signal for transition into a state containing an active neutrino component .",
    "the inclusion of this data puts much tighter constraints on @xmath24 and @xmath16 from a model independent analysis involving active neutrinos as compared to the sno cc / sk combination . in this paper",
    "we have discussed two useful strategies , of incorporating the nc data in the global @xmath43 analysis of rates and spectrum data , by which one can avoid the large @xmath0 flux uncertainty from the ssm .",
    "+ @xmath47 we fit the ratios of the sk elastic and sno cc rates w.r.t the nc rate , from which the @xmath24 cancels out .",
    "+ @xmath47 we fit the rates by keeping @xmath24 as a free parameter , where the inclusion of the sno nc rate (= @xmath24 ) serves to control this parameter .",
    "both the analyses give very similar results .",
    "they clearly favour the high(lma ) solution , while a limited region of the low solution is also acceptable at the @xmath3 level .",
    "the maximal mixing solution is disfavoured at the @xmath3 level . as more data",
    "accumulate one expects a substantial reduction in the error bar of the sno nc rate , resulting in further tightening of the allowed regions of neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "+   + _ note added _ : the paper @xcite appeared on the net after completion of our work . in the region of overlap",
    "our results agree with theirs as well as with the updated version of @xcite . it may be added here that the sno cc and nc rates given in table 1 are obtained assuming undistorted energy spectra above 5 mev , which for transitions to active neutrinos has good empirical justification as mentioned above .",
