    "the use of cryptography to secure elections was first suggested by chaum in 1981 in a highly influential paper on anonymous communications @xcite .",
    "chaum described new cryptographic primitives , or building blocks , and proposed various applications for these , including the possibility of conducting remote electronic elections .",
    "this idea proved popular in the academic research community , and , over the next two decades , a multitude of voting systems appeared in the literature , a handful of which resulted in actual prototype solutions @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , research in this domain was , for the most part , confined to academia and progressed independent of developments in real - world election technology .    in the last fifteen years",
    "however the situation has dramatically altered .",
    "research in securing elections has received a significant boost because of two main reasons : first , the gridlock in the us presidential election of 2000 between george w. bush and al gore cast a spotlight on the deficiencies of the us voting infrastructure where voters faced considerable difficulties in casting votes due to confusing ballot designs and punch card voting machines @xcite .",
    "this flurry of national attention led to passage of the help america vote act ( hava ) in 2002 which , among other provisions , allocated generous funding for research to improve voting technology @xcite .",
    "second , multiple investigations in recent years have highlighted glaring reliability and security issues in electronic voting machines which render them vulnerable to hackers and compromise the integrity of elections @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "indeed , there have been numerous documented instances of voting machines inexplicably malfunctioning during live elections , flipping candidate votes , or randomly adding and subtracting candidate votes . since then , academic research interest in securing elections has soared , and prompted the formation of dedicated conferences and journals and research organizations @xcite @xcite .    this renewed focus has led to the development of a new type of voting system with * end - to - end verifiable ( e2e ) security * properties .",
    "this highly promising advance , due to individual efforts by chaum @xcite and neff @xcite in 2004 , harmonizes theoretical research innovation with the ground realities of election administration to provide strong guarantees on the integrity of elections .",
    "we describe next a typical usage scenario which encapsulates the spirit of e2e voting systems .    on election day ,",
    "our voter , alice goes to the polling station to cast her vote .",
    "she identifies herself to polling staff as a legitimate voter and is guided to a private booth with a voting machine , where she chooses her candidate on the touchscreen .",
    "the machine issues her a _ receipt _ , which is essentially a cryptographically masked copy of her vote .",
    "in the booth , alice can also verify , either visually , or by challenging the machine , that her vote was * cast as intended * , i.e. the cryptographic obfuscation does indeed represent her chosen candidate and not another . after polls close , the system posts copies of all receipts on a public bulletin board or website where alice confirms that her vote has been * recorded as cast * , i.e. her receipt is included in the lot and it matches the physical copy she has in her hand . in the final step ,",
    "all receipts on the website are processed in a series of cryptographic computations to yield the election result .",
    "the algorithms and parameters for these operations are specified on the website , and any technically - minded person , including alice herself , can therefore verify that her own vote was * tallied as recorded * and that the tally is indeed correct .",
    "this scenario is starkly different from the current state of real - world elections where alice has to implicitly trust the voting system and its administrators for the credibility of the election .",
    "dishonest polling staff have been known to manipulate election results . furthermore , the internal operations of voting machines are opaque to alice and she has no assurance that the machine is actually doing what it is supposed to .",
    "e2e voting systems , on the other hand , preclude trust in personnel and machines and make the voter herself an active participant in auditing the election at every step and certifying its result . if a voting machine loses alice s vote or switches it to another candidate , her receipt on the website will reflect this change and alice can file a complaint , using her own physical copy as evidence . if polling staff tamper with the final tally , any third party running the tallying or verification algorithm on their own computers will pick up on it . furthermore , since alice s receipt is an obfuscation of her choice , she can not use it to convince a third party of how she voted , thereby thwarting vote - selling and coercion .",
    "we provide here a comprehensive high - level introduction to the field of e2e voting .",
    "the writing is aimed at the layman with little knowledge of cryptography and attempts to communicate a clear and intuitive appreciation of e2e voting systems .",
    "this chapter is organized as follows : we introduce security properties of voting systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : securitypropertiesofvotingsystems ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cryptosystems]-[sec : noncryptosystems ] , we summarize the workings of some twenty of the most influential e2e voting systems , classified into four distinct categories , as per their reliance on cryptography ( cryptographic and non - cryptographic systems ) , ballot format ( physical and electronic ballots ) , and mode of voting ( precinct - based and remote voting ) .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of open challenges to mainstream deployment of e2e voting systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : wayforward ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we describe key security properties characterizing e2e voting systems . many of these properties are intimately related whereas others are in direct conflict .",
    "the merits of a system are typically assessed on the basis of what properties it provides and how successfully their inherent conflicts are harmonized within the system .      the privacy of the vote is widely recognized as a fundamental human right and is enshrined in article 21 of the universal declaration of human rights @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind this , dating back to ancient greece and rome @xcite , is that if outside parties become privy to a voter s choice , it opens the door to bribery and intimidation , ultimately corrupting the electoral process .",
    "vote - buying was not uncommon in the western world up until the last century @xcite and still persists in some developing countries @xcite @xcite .",
    "likewise , voters may be intimidated by criminals , local politicians , or even family members , to vote a certain way .",
    "these fears directly motivated the notion of the _ secret ballot _ , which is typically implemented nowadays by providing the voter a private voting booth at the polling station .",
    "her ballot bears no distinguishing marks and her vote is cast in the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , making it very difficult , if not impossible , to ascertain her choice .",
    "in contrast , voting systems in the early research literature ( such as @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) explicitly maintained the voter - ballot linkage by issuing the voter a receipt enabling her to track her vote on a public bulletin board . in 1994 , benaloh and tuinstra @xcite ( and independently , niemi and renvall @xcite ) pointed out that this strategy allowed the voter to prove her vote to third party after the election , thereby facilitating vote - buying and coercion .",
    "the authors introduced the notion of _ receipt - freeness _ which proved influential and several voting systems that followed ( such as @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) dispensed with receipts entirely , focussing instead on ensuring transparency and integrity of the tallying operations .",
    "however , in 2004 , chaum @xcite re - introduced the use of receipts , with the important distinction that the contents of the receipt are cryptographically masked , thereby maintaining the voter s privacy .",
    "juels , catalano and jakobsson @xcite in 2005 argued that a coercer may yet influence a voter s choice without explicit knowledge of her vote , and described three such modes of coercion : the coercer may prevent the voter from voting , he may appropriate her voting credentials , or force her to vote for a candidate at random .",
    "the exact difference between receipt - freeness and coercion resistance is a subtle one @xcite : in receipt - freeness , the coercer is assumed to be restricted to observing the election and using evidence provided by a cooperating voter . in the case of coercion resistance ,",
    "the coercer is more powerful , and may craft specific votes for the voter to cast or even interact with her in some way while she is voting .",
    "juels et al .",
    "proposed a solution to defend against these threats which we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : jcjandcivitas ] .",
    "researchers have therefore progressively refined notions of vote privacy over the years into the following key properties :    * * ballot secrecy * : the voting system must not reveal who the voter voted for . * * receipt - freeness * : the voting system should not give the voter any evidence to prove to a third party how she voted .",
    "* * coercion - resistance * : the voter should be able to cast a vote for her intended choice even while appearing to cooperate with a coercer .",
    "intuitively , we see that each property encapsulates the previous one : coercion - resistance implies receipt - freeness which in turn implies ballot secrecy .      in real - world elections , the voter has to implicitly trust voting machines and polling staff for the integrity of the elections .",
    "typically there are ancillary processes in place to improve voter confidence in results , such as exit polls , random audits , and opening the tallying process to the public . on the other hand , voting systems in the research literature attempt to minimize the voter s dependence on personnel and machines , and use cryptography to provide ironclad guarantees on election integrity .",
    "sako and kilian @xcite distinguished between two forms of verifiability :    * * individual verifiability * : a voter can verify that her vote is included in the set of all cast votes .",
    "* * universal verifiability * : an observer can verify that the tally has been correctly computed from the set of all cast votes .",
    "e2e voting systems recast the notion of verifiability in terms of three core steps :    * * cast - as - intended * : the voter can verify the voting system correctly marked her candidate choice on the ballot . * * recorded - as - cast * : the voter can verify that her vote was correctly recorded by the voting system . *",
    "* tallied - as - recorded * : the voter can verify that her vote was counted as recorded .",
    "this translates as follows : the voter first confirms the system has correctly encrypted her vote .",
    "she then tracks her vote on the bulletin board using her receipt and confirms that it is correctly recorded .",
    "integrity of the result is ensured by rigorously auditing the tallying process and requiring the system to publish cryptographic proofs of correct operation .",
    "this three - step verification therefore covers the entire life cycle of the vote , and the voter can be confident that if there is any tampering or breakdown in the system it will be discovered in one of the checks .",
    "these two conceptions of verifiability are also linked : in most e2e voting systems , cast - as - intended and recorded - as - cast checks are verified by the voter , i.e. together they provide individual verifiability , whereas the tallied - as - recorded step may be undertaken by voters and observers alike , i.e. it provides universal verifiability .",
    "we list here certain additional properties also vitally important in voting systems :    * * eligibility verifiability * : an observer can verify that each vote in the set of all cast votes was cast by an eligible voter .",
    "* * accountability * : in case vote verification fails at some stage , possibly due to error or fraud , the voter should be able to conclusively prove that it failed to the relevant authorities , without compromising the secrecy of her ballot . * * robustness * : the system should be robust to a certain degree of malfunction or corruption and still deliver correct results .",
    "a small number of misbehaving voters or system failures should not disrupt the election .",
    "* * usability * : the system should enable voters to cast their votes easily and effectively . * * accessability * : the system provides equal opportunity for access and participation ( including guarantees on vote privacy and verifiability ) to voters with disabilities .",
    "several of the key properties described thus far conflict with each other in subtle ways , resulting in a variety of technical and legal challenges .",
    "for instance , as noted in the discussion on receipt - freeness , vote privacy clashes with vote verifiability .",
    "if a voter can successfully prove her vote to a third party outside the polling station , she could easily sell her vote or be coerced into voting for a certain candidate .",
    "a detailed treatment of this tension between verifiability and privacy in voting systems may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is a tension between vote verifiability and usability . requiring voters to verify their vote negatively impacts usability by adding extra steps to the process , which may prove confusing for the voter @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental trials have noted that only a very small percentage of voters actually verify their vote @xcite @xcite , which may critically undermine the security guarantees of these voting systems .",
    "we discuss these issues in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : usability ] .",
    "accessability also conflicts with vote privacy .",
    "adapting voting systems to provide audio / visual aids or human assistance for voters with disabilities may create situations where the voter s candidate choice is revealed to a third party .",
    "likewise , deploying voting systems for remote scenarios , such as postal or internet voting , while significantly more convenient compared to in - person voting at polling stations , results in a marked deterioration in vote privacy @xcite . in her home the voter is not guaranteed privacy and is also vulnerable to coercion .",
    "faced with such situations , designers of voting systems typically incorporate technological remedies or procedural safeguards into the system , prioritise certain security requirements over others , or perhaps even focus on satisfying certain properties in a weaker form .",
    "we encounter several such examples in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we describe notable e2e voting systems which rely on cryptography to guarantee e2e verifiability .",
    "these systems are further categorized depending on the ballot format they support : _ physical ballots _ (",
    "i.e. paper ballots ) as opposed to _ electronic ballots _ , and their mode of deployment , for _ precinct - based voting _",
    "( i.e. in - person voting at polling stations ) versus _ remote voting_.    there is considerable cross - fertilization across categories .",
    "many systems incorporate common cryptographic primitives and procedural innovations . furthermore , several systems share a common lineage and design philosophy which we have attempted to highlight in our presentation .",
    "we have also included certain systems which provide only a subset of e2e security properties , i.e. they are not strictly e2e verifiable , but nevertheless make an important contribution to the field .",
    "this category comprises precinct - based systems in which the tally is computed from receipts of paper ballots which voters mark by hand or using a machine .",
    "these systems are directly descended from votegrity , and prominent examples include scantegrity and prt  voter , which have been deployed in politically binding elections .",
    "votegrity @xcite was invented by chaum in 2004 and is one of the very first and most influential e2e voting systems .",
    "votegrity uses visual cryptography to render the verification process more intelligible to the layman .    in * visual cryptography",
    "* @xcite , an image is split into multiple shares , such that individual shares do not yield any meaningful information about the original image and appear to contain random information . however , when the shares are overlaid the original image is reconstructed . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : visualcrypto ] for the case of two shares , each pixel symbol is subdivided into four sub - pixels . when the shares are superimposed , identical pixels on both layers result in a semi - transparent or _ white _ pixel , whereas",
    ", if the two pixels are different , the resulting pixel will be opaque or _",
    "black_. individual pixels on a layer reveal no information about the final result .",
    "vote processing in votegrity is undertaken by a group of election trustees . *",
    "public - key cryptography * is employed to maintain voter privacy and integrity of the tally . in this paradigm ,",
    "each trustee possesses two keys , a _",
    "key he uses for data encryption and which is publicly posted , for example , on the election website or in a directory , and a _ private _",
    "key used for decryption , which he keeps strictly private .",
    "these two keys are mutually related such that any entity can use the trustee s public key to encrypt data but only the trustee himself can decrypt it since he alone owns the corresponding private key .",
    "many security protocols , including voting systems , specify multiple trustees to diffuse responsibility and trust . in this case , a system s security , may only be compromised if all trustees secretly collude .",
    "trustees are therefore typically chosen such that they are mutually distrusting , i.e. they may belong to competing political parties and include activists and members of citizen groups .    on election day , alice casts her vote at her local polling station .",
    "she enters her candidate choice on a voting machine , and presses a button , and a printer attached to the machine prints patterns on two strips of paper using visual cryptography .",
    "these strips are presented superimposed under a custom viewfinder , and the voter s choice is clearly visible .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : visualcryptovote ] depicts a vote for _",
    "pixels on both strips are generated using a pseudo - random function , i.e. the patterns on the individual images appear random to an observer but are actually generated in a deterministic manner .",
    "the voting machine also imprints a serial number and some validating information on both strips .",
    "alice randomly chooses one of the strips as a receipt to take home .",
    "the machine shreds the other strip , issues the chosen strip to alice , and saves a digital image of it to memory .    after polls close , the system publishes all saved voter receipts on a public bulletin board or website .",
    "alice can locate her receipt using the serial number and verify that the digital image and validating information matches with her physical receipt .",
    "if there is any discrepancy , i.e. if the online receipt is missing or if the two versions do not match , she can initiate an inquiry with election authorities .",
    "votegrity s key breakthrough is this new role of the receipt .",
    "the printed information includes character strings which appear random to an observer but are actually a digital encoding of data which enables election trustees to fully reconstruct both original strips , and thereby the vote itself .",
    "when the voting machine generates the strips , it encrypts a digital copy of the visual patterns on both using the trustees public keys , and this encryption , or _ ciphertext _ , is then printed on the receipt .",
    "the encryption may be understood with the analogy of an onion , where the vote is successively encapsulated in multiple skins or layers of encryption , each corresponding to a particular trustee . in the public - key paradigm",
    "only trustees can decrypt a vote by applying their private keys individually to remove corresponding layers of encryption .",
    "the system decrypts cast votes in a privacy - preserving and verifiable manner using * decryption mixes*. a mix , invented by chaum @xcite , is essentially a _ permutation box _ which accepts multiple data items , removes a layer of encryption , shuffles the items , and outputs them .",
    "a * mixnet * consists of multiple such mixes connected together in cascading order such that the outputs of one feed into the next , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chaummixnet ] .",
    "a mixnet effectively obscures the link between an input and an output and is a key ingredient in various anonymous communications protocols .",
    "each mix is operated by an individual election trustee .",
    "all receipts on the bulletin board are fed into the mixnet .",
    "the first mix strips the serial numbers from the receipts in addition to decryption and shuffling .",
    "each mix removes a layer of encryption from the ciphertexts , figuratively peeling the onion , using the private key of the trustee operating the mix .",
    "the final result is a set of fully decrypted , or _",
    "plaintext _ ,",
    "votes stripped of any identifying information regarding the voter .",
    "these votes are then tallied in a straightforward manner .",
    "each mix processes its batch privately .",
    "alice can be assured her vote is secret as revealing it would require all the trustees collude to track her vote across each mix .",
    "however , there is still the issue of integrity : alice can not be sure the mixes are correctly processing the receipts and not altering them in transit .",
    "chaum suggests election authorities publicly audit the mixes using a technique known as * randomized partial checking * @xcite .",
    "the key idea is very simple : after tallying is concluded , each mix is forced to reveal a randomly chosen selection of half its inputs and outputs .",
    "these are posted on the bulletin board so that any observer can verify that the mix decrypted and mixed the items correctly .",
    "if a mix tampers with a single vote , there is a 50% chance it will get caught in a random check .",
    "the odds of being detected increase with every additional vote the mix manipulates , and would be close to a 100% if a mix manipulates enough votes to influence a large - scale election .",
    "however , while it is essential that mixes be subjected to this check , it is also vital that no receipt on the bulletin board be traced through the mixes to a plaintext vote .",
    "this is accomplished by selecting input - output links in an exclusory manner such that no _ end - to - end _ path across the mixnet is revealed .",
    "for example , considering the first two mixes in fig .",
    "[ fig : chaummixnet ] , using dashed lines to denote unmasked links , we see that paths revealed in one mix are kept strictly private in the adjacent mix .",
    "now that the entire system has been described , we discuss the security properties it offers : when alice casts her vote , she can visually verify that the printer correctly printed her candidate choice . furthermore",
    ", each strip is digitally signed by the voting machine . * digital signatures * are cryptographic equivalents of real signatures and have legal standing in several countries . in this case",
    ", the voting machine itself has a public / private key pair and their role is reversed : the machine s private key is used to mathematically compute a`signature ' on the information on the receipt .",
    "this is a string of data which any observer can easily verify using the voting machine s public key ( available via the bulletin board or in a public directory ) .",
    "successful verification is undeniable proof of origin , as only the machine possesses the private key responsible for the signature . in case of a dispute ,",
    "a digital signature is thus non - repudiable proof that the receipt was issued by a legitimate voting machine .    by digitally signing each strip ,",
    "the machine may therefore be considered to have _ committed _ itself to both strips .",
    "alice then chooses one layer at random to take home .",
    "if the machine were to cheat and put fraudulent information on single strips for a significant number of voters , it would be detected with very high probability .    outside the polling station",
    ", alice can verify , using the public keys of the trustees , that the ciphertext on the receipt is indeed a correct encryption of the visual pattern on her receipt .",
    "this gives her high assurance that her vote was cast as she intended .",
    "she can ensure the system correctly recorded her vote by verifying her physical receipt on the bulletin board . when mixing and tallying are undertaken ,",
    "the inputs and outputs of every mix are publicly posted on the bulletin board .",
    "any observer , including alice , can monitor the random checks on the mixnets and confirm the results .",
    "randomized partial checking is well - suited to audit elections as it does not rely on complex cryptography and is therefore efficient and relatively easier for the voter to appreciate .",
    "any observer can verify the final tally for themselves by adding up all the decrypted votes .",
    "furthermore , none of the information on the receipt or the bulletin board leaks any knowledge of the contents of alice s vote which a third party may exploit to bribe or intimidate her . the visual image on her receipt is incomprehensible without the second strip which the voting machine shredded during the vote - casting phase , and theoretically it could represent a vote for _ any _ candidate .    in short , alice",
    "can now audit the election at every key stage herself and need not trust election authorities for election integrity .",
    "furthermore , election verifiability is independent of underlying infrastructure such as voting machines or vendor software .",
    "technically - minded voters can create ( and distribute ) software to perform the necessary verifications using the information on their receipts and the bulletin board .",
    "votegrity has proved immensely influential and inaugurated new directions for research in secure elections .",
    "several systems the followed borrow the basic receipt - and - mixnet template and improve on practical aspects .",
    "we consider these next .",
    "prt  voter @xcite , initially proposed by ryan in 2005 as a variant of votegrity @xcite , was later developed into an independent system by chaum , ryan , and schneider @xcite .",
    "we provide a brief overview .",
    "prt  voter replaces votegrity s visual cryptography element with a paper ballot and randomized candidate ordering .",
    "the ballot , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pretballot ] , is detachable into two halves along the perforated line in the middle .",
    "the left half lists candidates in randomized order . the right half has corresponding marking spaces and a random - looking string of alphanumeric characters , referred to as the _ onion _ , printed at the bottom .",
    "the onion encodes the permutation of candidate names on the specific ballot relative to a standard _",
    "canonical _ ordering , encased in multiple layers of encryption using the public keys of the election trustees , as in votegrity .",
    "the workings of the system are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pretprocess ] .",
    "to vote , alice marks her candidate choice on the ballot , detaches the two halves and shreds the left side with the candidate ordering .",
    "she then scans the right - hand side and takes it home as her receipt .",
    "after polls close , all scanned receipts are posted on the bulletin board where alice can verify her vote is correctly recorded .",
    "however , she can not prove her choice to a third party with just the right half of the ballot since her mark could potentially correspond to any candidate .",
    "vote processing is analogous to votegrity .",
    "all receipts on the bulletin board are passed through a series of mixes operated by election trustees who use their private keys to successively peel the onion , thereby reconstructing the voter s choice as per the canonical candidate ordering .",
    "the mixing process is audited using randomized partial checking .",
    "the reconstructed votes are tallied in a straightforward manner .",
    "verification needs to be performed on another front as well : voters need assurance that ballots are well - formed , i.e. the onions in the lower right half of the ballot correctly encrypt the randomization of candidates on the ballots .",
    "prt  voter includes a step allowing alice to audit her ballot in the polling booth by requesting the system to decrypt the onions and prove that they correspond to the candidate ordering .",
    "audited ballots do not count towards the tally and are discarded and alice may audit as many ballots as she likes until she is satisfied the system is not cheating and then cast her actual vote .",
    "the authors also recommend that election authorities publicly audit a set of ballots prior to the election to create public confidence .",
    "a sufficiently sized random sampling of ballots should be picked , making it very hard for a malicious party to distribute large numbers of malformed ballots without detection .",
    "after polls close , any leftover ballots should be similarly audited for greater confidence .",
    "prt  voter is one of the most prominent e2e voting systems and extensive work has been done in maintaining and extending it .",
    "notable contributions include adapting prt  voter for different electoral systems @xcite @xcite and voting scenarios @xcite , enhancing its usability @xcite @xcite @xcite , and implementing the system @xcite .",
    "a variant of prt  voter was used in binding state elections in the australian state of victoria in 2014 @xcite @xcite .",
    "punchscan @xcite , invented by chaum in 2006 , is especially suited for elections where rules mandate a uniform candidate ordering on ballots .",
    "punchscan takes inspiration from votegrity s notion of layers and randomizes voter choices on the ballot .",
    "the latter innovation is in contrast to prt  voter s approach where the candidate ordering is randomized on ballots .    the punchscan ballot , shown in fig .  [ fig : punchscanballot ] , consists of two layers . the top layer has the candidate names ordered using numbers or letters ( _ a , b , c , d _ , etc . ) and a set of holes at the bottom .",
    "the lower layer contains a random ordering of the same letters .",
    "when the layers are overlaid , the letters are visible through the holes . in the polling booth , alice marks her choice , using a marker to daub the appropriate hole , thereby marking both layers at the same time .",
    "the layers are then separated . when considered individually",
    ", the top layer only indicates which hole she chose , whereas the lower indicates the letter she selected , and both layers are needed by a viewer to discern her candidate choice .",
    "alice randomly picks one layer to cast and shreds the other .",
    "she retains a copy of the cast layer as her receipt .",
    "vote processing is similar to the systems described earlier .",
    "when polls close , alice can check the bulletin board to verify that her vote was recorded as cast .",
    "the ballot serial number , printed in the top right corner on both layers of the ballot , encodes encrypted information which enables election trustees to determine the voter s choice .",
    "punchscan replaces the back - end decryption mixnet of earlier systems with an anonymizing database referred to as the _",
    "punchboard_.    the punchboard consists of three interlinked tables .",
    "the first one lists all markable options on all created ballots whereas the last lists the candidate corresponding to each option .",
    "for instance , for fig .",
    "[ fig : punchscanballot ] , the first table will list an entry for the third option which corresponds to a vote for _ nihilist _ in the last table .",
    "however , the direct links between entries on these these two tables are shuffled via an intermediate table and the shuffling pattern is masked using encryption .",
    "this is conceptually similar to how a mix randomizes its inputs but is far more efficient as votes do not have to be encrypted and decrypted multiple times . instead the system transmits the marks on each receipt over the set of secret paths directly to the appropriate candidates , incrementing their vote count accordingly .",
    "the punchboard and ballots are generated by election trustees prior to the election and their configuration is kept strictly secret .",
    "a preliminary audit is conducted in which half the ballots are randomly picked and publicly revealed along with the corresponding paths in the punchboard .",
    "any party can verify that votes cast on these ballots would most certainly have been routed to the right candidates and thereby derive confidence in the system .",
    "audited ballots are then destroyed and the remaining half used in the polls . after tallying concludes ,",
    "the punchboard is again audited using randomized partial checking , i.e. each path is partially decrypted to prove the system is operating correctly without revealing any end - to - end paths in the process .",
    "some attacks have been discovered against punchscan @xcite and corresponding procedural safeguards have been recommended .",
    "other notable research contributions include adapting punchscan for remote scenarios @xcite , reducing opportunities for privacy violation @xcite , and merging prt  voter and punchscan for stronger privacy @xcite .",
    "punchscan source code was released under an open - source license and the system was trialled in elections of the university of ottawa s graduate students association in 2007 @xcite .",
    "punchscan was later merged into the scantegrity voting system .",
    "scantegrity @xcite , developed in 2008 by a team of researchers including david chaum and ron rivest , enhances existing real - world voting systems with e2e verifiability .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that infrastructure , such as optical scan technology , is already widely deployed and voters are familiar with its usage .    the scantegrity ballot , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scantegrityballot ] , lists the candidates with randomly picked code letters assigned to each .",

    "similar to punchscan , every code letter on every ballot translates to a vote for a specific candidate in an anonymizing database , in this case referred to as the _ switchboard_. votes are routed accordingly over encrypted paths in a privacy - preserving and auditable manner .",

    "the experience led to further modifications to the system to incorporate features requested by voters and election officials , resulting in scantegrity iii @xcite .      in a paper",
    "in 2006 , adida and rivest @xcite noted that mixnets entail complicated mixing and auditing protocols , and require the voter to have faith that election trustees will not collude to subvert the election . to address these shortcomings , they invented scratch & vote ( s&v ) , which combines the user - friendly voting experience of prt  voter with the backend simplicity of homomorphic encryption .",
    "ballots are encrypted using * homomorphic encryption * , a cryptographic primitive which enables them to be tabulated while still in encrypted form .",
    "the result of a homomorphic addition on a set of ciphertexts is equivalent to an addition operation performed on the set of plaintexts .",
    "only the result of the addition operation is decrypted , thereby preserving the individual voter s privacy .",
    "homomorphic encryption was first applied to electronic voting in 1985 by josh benaloh in his landmark work @xcite @xcite and is a key ingredient in several voting systems that follow .    to provide voters with further security assurances , s&v distributes the corresponding decryption key among multiple election trustees using threshold cryptography , thereby minimizing risk of abuse of cryptographic credentials . * threshold cryptography * @xcite is conceptually similar to visual cryptography ( discussed earlier in sec .",
    "[ sec : votegrity ] ) in that a decryption key is mathematically split into several shares which are distributed among mutually distrusting trustees .",
    "the decryption therefore requires the explicit cooperation of a threshold amount of these trustees , and at no time does any party possess the complete key .    furthermore , vote encryption is also * probabilistic*. in public - key cryptosystems , we recall that the public key used for encryption is not secret , it is accessible to everyone .",
    "if alice s vote were therefore encrypted in a deterministic manner , an attacker could easily mount a * brute - force attack * to deduce it , i.e. he could use the trustees public keys to encrypt every possible voting option on alice s ballot and compare the ciphertexts thus generated with those printed on alice s receipt or on the bulletin board .",
    "probabilistic encryption techniques insert random numbers into the encryption algorithm so that every encryption operation on the same plaintext yields different ciphertexts .",
    "these random numbers are large enough that they can not be simply guessed and they are kept strictly secret .",
    "probabilistic encryption is important in several security protocols and is used in all the voting systems described in this chapter reliant on encryption , including the ones described earlier .",
    "the reason for highlighting its use here is that , in s&v , the probabilistic nature of the encryption plays a vital role in the vote verification process .        the s&v ballot , depicted in fig .  [ fig : scratchvoteballot ] , detaches into three parts .",
    "the left half lists candidate names in randomized order .",
    "the right side bears corresponding markable spaces and a barcode",

    "any party can therefore scratch off this surface to reveal the random numbers , use them to independently encrypt the candidate choices , and compare it with the barcode data , thereby confirming that the ballot is correctly formed .    at the polling station ,",
    "every voter is handed two ballots , one to audit and one to cast .",
    "alice randomly selects one , removes the scratch surface and verifies that the candidate ordering corresponds to the barcode data .",
    "the authors note that voters generally do not possess the technical expertise to perform this check and suggest that trusted helper organizations may assist them at the polls by providing equipment and guidance . removing the scratch surface also invalidates the ballot and it can no longer be used .",
    "alice then proceeds to cast her vote with the second ballot , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scratchvoteballot ] . in a manner similar to prt  voter",
    ", she marks her chosen candidate , removes and discards the left side , and hands the ballot to a member of polling staff .",
    "he ensures the scratch surface on the ballot is intact , and detaches and destroys it without revealing the underlying content .",
    "this step is vital as knowledge of the random numbers would allow a coercer to reconstruct alice s vote from her receipt .",
    "the ballot , now consisting only of the voter mark and the barcode , is cast .",
    "alice is issued a scanned copy as a receipt .",
    "after polls close , alice can verify on the bulletin board that her vote is correctly recorded . to tabulate results ,",
    "election staff examine each cast ballot and extract the particular ciphertext from the barcode corresponding to the voter s mark .",
    "this ciphertext is essentially an encrypted electronic ballot where the underlying plaintext assigns a ` 1 ' to the candidate of the voter s choice and ` 0 ' for all others .",
    "an addition operation is performed over all extracted ciphertexts such that the the ones and zeros assigned to candidates in the individual votes are directly summed up .",
    "election trustees then engage in a protocol to decrypt the result using their individual shares of the decryption key , and post cryptographic proofs of correct decryption on the bulletin board .",
    "any observer can easily download the contents of the bulletin board and run his own checks to verify that votes have been correctly summed and decrypted .",
    "individual votes are never decrypted , thereby maintaining voter privacy .",
    "adida and rivest also present extensions to this basic scheme , including steps to adapt s&v to a punchscan ballot , facilitate multiple races , and include larger numbers of candidates .",
    "they discuss procedural missteps and attacks which weaken the security of s&v and note that these are common to systems like prt  voter and punchscan , where ballots are filled out by hand .",
    "this category consists of systems where electronic votes are cast and tallied in a precinct - based setting .",
    "systems in this category are characterized by inventive combinations of various cryptographic primitives and include influential systems such as markpledge and the notion of voter initiated auditing .",
    "markpledge @xcite , invented by neff in 2004 , is , alongside chaum s votegrity , one of the earliest e2e voting systems .",
    "the key innovation of this system is a novel front - end protocol allowing voters to directly challenge voting machines in the polling booth to prove that they are encrypting votes correctly .    on the markpledge ballot ,",
    "each candidate is assigned a row of _ indexes _ denoted by pairs of bits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : markpledge ] .",
    "a _ no _ vote is denoted by dissimilar combinations such as ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) , and a _ yes _ vote is denoted by a pairs of similar bits , ( 1,1 ) or ( 0,0 ) .",
    "when alice chooses a candidate , the voting machine will assign her chosen candidate a _ yes _ vote and _ no _ votes to all the rest .",
    "the machine then individually encrypts every bit in each index on the ballot and displays on - screen a _ commitment _ for the chosen candidate .",
    "this commitment is essentially a bitstring , a series of bits where each individual bit corresponds to the _ yes / no _ content of each index , i.e. _ both _",
    "ciphertext bits for the chosen candidate .",
    "for example , the commitment 1,1,0, ... ,1 for _ anarchist _ ( encoded in an alphanumeric format as _ dir8 _ ) implies that the bits , as depicted , are ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,1 ) , ( 0,0), ... ,(1,1 ) which are all _ yes _ combinations whereas all other candidates are assigned _ no _ combinations .    as in scratch & vote ,",
    "a probabilistic encryption technique is used to encrypt votes .",
    "once the machine has encrypted her vote , alice can challenge it by making it reveal the randomness used in encrypting either the right or the left bit of indexes ( but not both ) for all candidates .",
    "this process is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : markpledge ] . alice s challenge consists of a bitstring , where a 0 denotes bits on the left - hand side and 1 denotes bits on the right - hand side .",
    "alice can thus confirm that each revealed bit matches with the commitment displayed earlier by the machine .",
    "the machine can not predict beforehand which bits alice will choose , and if it has tampered with her vote ( by encrypting _ no _ bit combinations for her candidate of choice ) , there is a very high probability that the deception will be revealed in the bits that alice forces the machine to unmask .",
    "this mechanism assures alice that the machine has encrypted her vote correctly and that her vote is cast as intended .",
    "once the challenge is concluded , the machine then generates _ no _ votes for all other candidates on the ballot with the important innovation that it populates alice s chosen right / left bit positions to make it appear that they are _",
    "yes _ votes .",
    "all this information , including encrypted indexes , the machine s commitment , alice s challenge , and the random elements are printed on alice s receipt in the form of short strings of alphanumeric characters , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : markpledgereceipt ] .",
    "after polls close , all receipts are posted on the bulletin board and voters can confirm that their votes are correctly recorded .",
    "votes are decrypted and tallied using mixnets in an auditable process similar to schemes described earlier in section  [ sec : precinctbasedvotingwithphysicalballots ] .",
    "alice only needs to ensure that the commitment string the machine originally displayed is printed next to the candidate of her choice ( i.e. _ dir8 _ for _ anarchist _ in this case ) and she has to retain this string in memory for a short period while challenging the machine .",
    "a coercer , examining her receipt at a later time , will only see _ yes",
    "_ votes for every candidate , and will be unable to deduce her actual vote .",
    "alice alone can differentiate her original _ yes _",
    "vote from a fake yes vote , due to the challenge interaction in the privacy of the polling booth , but is unable to prove it to a third party .",
    "this is also the reason that the machine only decrypts the right or left bit position , and not both , during a challenge : if alice were to record the randomness used to encrypt both bits of an index , she could easily prove her vote to a third party .",
    "markpledge is analyzed in greater detail by adida and neff @xcite who propose that _ helper organizations _ , consisting of political party members or activist groups , assist the voter with more detailed verification checks .",
    "joaquim and ribeiro suggest a mechanism to make the markpledge cast - as - intended verification process faster and more efficient @xcite .",

    "random numbers are generated , grouped such that each candidate is assigned one set of _ n _ numbers ) .",
    "these numbers , referred to as _ dummy votes _ , are kept secret , but the trustees publicly commit to them on the bulletin board before elections using a commitment scheme .",
    "a * commitment scheme * is a cryptographic primitive which enables a party to publicly commit to a chosen secret without revealing it until a later time .",

    "no one else can open the box .",
    "commitment schemes are also _ binding _ in the sense that the prover can not alter the contents of the box without being detected by the verifier . in our case",

    "every time a vote is cast for a certain candidate , all other candidates are assigned dummy votes . in this way , a dummy vote initially allocated to the chosen candidate in the pool of dummy votes is not used .",
    "therefore , the final tally can be computed by examining this pool and the candidate with the largest number of unused dummy votes is the winner of the election .    however , election trustees need to prove that voting machines correctly allocated the dummy votes to candidates .",
    "moreover , this needs to be accomplished without publicly differentiating between dummy votes and voter - generated random numbers on receipts , else voter privacy would be compromised .",
    "first , election trustees publish the list of unused dummy votes on the bulletin board alongside their respective commitments and the corresponding reveal information .",
    "next , the trustees publish cryptographic proofs testifying to the integrity of the receipts , i.e. each receipt contains exactly one voter - generated random number , each dummy vote used in the elections was correctly allocated by the machines , and it was used only once .",
    "these proofs can be verified by any observer and do not reveal any information which may enable him to identify dummy votes and voter - generated random numbers .",
    "alice verifies her vote was cast as intended by ensuring the random number she generates in the voting booth is assigned to the candidate of her choice on her receipt .",
    "she ensures her vote is recorded correctly by verifying her receipt on the bulletin board .",
    "her privacy is preserved and she is protected from coercion as the newly generated random number assigned to her candidate is indistinguishable from the dummy votes assigned to the other candidates on the receipt .",

    "in contrast to this approach , in 2006 , josh benaloh introduced the notion of * voter initiated auditing * @xcite @xcite @xcite to give the voter immediate confidence that her vote has been correctly cast . in this paradigm ,",
    "when alice chooses her candidate , the voting machine prints an encryption of the vote on her receipt but does not dispense it . instead , the machine asks alice whether she wishes to _ cast _ the vote or _ challenge _ it .",

    "if alice is uncertain that the machine has encrypted her vote correctly , she can challenge it to prove it is honest ( this step is often referred to as a ` benaloh ' challenge ) .",
    "the machine then prints on the receipt , alongside the encrypted vote , the contents of alice s ballot and the randomness used to generate the encryption .",
    "this data allows alice , or any other party , to replicate the encryption step independently using the election public key , as described earlier in section  [ sec : scratchandvote ] .",

    "adder is suited to both small and large - scale elections , as well as surveys and data collection applications .",
    "adder includes a preliminary setup phase in which multiple election trustees engage in a cryptographic protocol to create a public key for the election which is then published on the election website .",
    "the corresponding decryption key is distributed among the trustees using threshold cryptography .",
    "to vote , alice navigates her web browser to the election website , logs in using voting credentials which identify her as an eligible voter , and downloads the election public key .",
    "alice makes her candidate choice and her web browser then generates and encrypts her vote using the election public key and computes and appends a proof of well - formedness .",
    "all encrypted votes received by the system are posted on an online bulletin board , where voters can verify they have been correctly recorded .",
    "after polls close , an addition operation is performed over all the encrypted votes on the bulletin board .",
    "election trustees then publicly provide partial decryption information using their individual shares of the decryption key , which enable the server to decrypt the tally .",
    "all intermediate computations are posted on the bulletin board .",
    "adder s security properties are fairly intuitive : the voter encrypts and transmits her own vote and can later verify it is correctly recorded on the bulletin board .",
    "privacy is ensured because individual votes can not be decrypted unless a threshold amount of these election trustees collude .",
    "voters and observers alike can audit the tallying and decryption process by accessing the bulletin board and verifying each step .    however , adder is vulnerable to critical security issues common to internet voting systems .",
    "the first is the * untrusted terminal problem * : it is trivially easy for malicious software on alice s computer to leak knowledge of her vote or switch her vote to another candidate without her knowledge , and she can not detect this by examining the ciphertext .",
    "second , physical privacy can not be guaranteed .",
    "someone may be standing at alice s shoulder while she votes .",
    "furthermore , a coercer , such as a political activist or a family member , may force her to vote a particular way .",

    "the system designed by juels , catalano and jakobsson in 2005 , commonly referred to as jcj @xcite , is notable in that it is the first online voting scheme to offer a high level of coercion - resistance .",
    "jcj combines various cryptographic primitives in a novel protocol that has proved very influential in the research literature .",
    "jcj assumes that prior to elections , there is an in - person voter registration phase , conducted in a trusted and private environment , where alice receives a voting credential from the election registrar .",
    "this credential is her proof of eligibility and can be used to vote in several different elections . after the registration phase concludes , the registrar publishes an encrypted list of all voting credentials on the bulletin board .",
    "alice then uses a public algorithm to generate any number of _ fake _ credentials which are indistinguishable from her real one to a third party .",
    "she can use these to cast votes under coercion or even freely yield these to coercers to vote on her behalf .",
    "votes cast using fake credentials will show up on the bulletin board as legitimate cast votes but will ultimately be rejected by the system prior to tallying .",
    "it is assumed the coercer is not monitoring alice for the entire duration of the election and she gets some private moments to vote using her real credential",

    "alice s vote includes her candidate choice and her voting credential and is encrypted with the public key of the election trustees .",

    "after polls close , all vote ciphertexts received by the system are published onto the bulletin board where alice can verify that hers was correctly recorded .",
    "election trustees then process votes on the bulletin board .",
    "vote proofs are examined and malformed votes or those with unusable credentials are discarded . a * plaintext equivalence test * is used to check if multiple votes have been cast using the same credential .",

    "no direct information about the credentials or votes themselves is revealed in this test , i.e. voter identities and candidate choices are still secret .",
    "if multiple votes using the same credential are identified , they may be processed according to some _ revoting _ policy such that only one vote per credential is actually counted .",
    "for instance , only the most recent vote could be retained and all others using the same credential could be eliminated",
    ".    however , this batch still contains votes cast using fake credentials which have to be identified and discarded .",
    "all votes are passed through a * re - encryption mixnet*. as opposed to decryption mixes ( described earlier in sec .",
    "[ sec : votegrity ] ) which peel off layers of encryption from the vote , re - encryption mixes instead simply inject fresh randomness into the ciphertext .",
    "this _ re - randomization _ generates a batch of completely new ciphertexts which are still encryptions of the original plaintext data , i.e. votes and credentials .",
    "these new ciphertexts are then shuffled and output .",
    "the plaintext equivalence test is then again run , this time to compare the encrypted credential in each new ciphertext with the encrypted list of valid voting credentials published by the election authority prior to the election .",
    "all votes with fake credentials can then be identified and discarded by the system without revealing the credentials themselves .",
    "leftover votes are then decrypted and tallied in a straightforward manner to yield the election result .",
    "the equivalence tests and the mixing and tallying processes are conducted in a publicly verifiable manner , and all intermediate results are posted on the bulletin board where observers can audit them for correctness . this mix - and - compare process is what gives jcj the property of coercion - resistance .",
    "the re - encryption mixnet effectively breaks the association between cast votes and counted votes such that a coercer has no way of determining if the credential he holds is real or fake and if the vote he cast was included in the final tally or not .",
    "however jcj has a key disadvantage : the processing time and computation costs of this scheme are very high because compute - intensive plaintext equivalence tests need to be performed for every vote .",
    "there have been several suggestions in the literature to optimize this process , including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "trivitas @xcite adapts civitas to further simplify the non - intuitive and complex verifiability process for the layman voter by introducing the notion of _ trial votes_. these are cast alongside regular votes , and are processed in much the same way , except that trial votes are decrypted and revealed at different stages , enabling the voter to derive strong confidence that her actual vote is being correctly handled .",

    "each code sheet bears a unique ballot i d .        to vote , alice logs onto the system , and inputs the i d on her code sheet , followed by the vote code for the candidate of her choice .",
    "for example , she would type in _ 2168 _ to vote for _ anarchist_. the system responds with the corresponding acknowledgement code , in this case , _ 854269_. since the codes are randomly assigned and known only to alice and the trustees , a malware on her computer or an attacker eavesdropping on network traffic can not deduce her vote nor alter it in any meaningful way without being detected . furthermore , alice s vote code assures the trustees that they are communicating with alice herself , since it should be difficult for an attacker to procure her code sheet .",
    "likewise , if alice receives the correct acknowledgement code , she can be certain her vote was correctly received by the trustees and not an attacker masquerading as a trustee . if either party enters a wrong code , the protocol fails .",
    "after polls close , ballot ids for all votes received by the system are published on the bulletin board and alice can check that hers is included in the list .",
    "decryption mixnets are then used to anonymize votes prior to tallying , similar to votegrity and prt  voter , and the process is likewise audited using randomized partial checking .",
    "the bulletin board does not display vote receipts otherwise it would be trivially easy for alice to prove her vote to a third party using her code sheet .",

    "aperio has inspired an electronic counterpart , eperio @xcite , which employs cryptographic primitives to similarly verify votes against commitment lists .",
    "another system , hash - only verification ( _ hover _ ) @xcite , uses this verification approach in conjunction with the scantegrity optical - scan system to reduce reliance on election trustees and make the voting system intelligible to non - technical voters .",
    "as described thus far , considerable work has been done on developing e2e voting systems and reconciling theoretical notions with practical realities .",
    "however , to fully transition these systems into the real world , a host of pressing technical issues , usability concerns , and legal dilemmas still need to be resolved . in this section ,",
    "we briefly overview progress and outstanding challenges in these domains .",
    "as often happens when prototyping theoretical systems , the implementation itself may introduce security flaws .",
    "karlof et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed two systems , votegrity and markpledge , and described several scenarios where voter privacy and election integrity may be compromised by exploiting flaws in how the systems were built .",
    "for instance , malicious software on voting machines could encrypt votes in a manner that surreptitiously leaks information regarding the voter s candidate choice .",
    "malicious voting machines may sabotage an election by issuing large numbers of forged or invalid receipts .",
    "large scale attacks would be detected but may negatively impacting public confidence in the system . human factors also need to be considered .",
    "for instance , voters who do not intend to verify their votes may discard their receipts on polling premises where a poll worker could collect them and later manipulate the corresponding votes without fear of detection .",
    "researchers have presented various practical guidelines to implementing voting systems : karlof et al .",
    "advocate a * systems approach * @xcite which essentially states that security analyses of such systems should not examine system components in isolation but consider the entire system and how the individual parts interact with each other .",
    "bruck et al .",
    "strongly caution against  all - at - once \" approaches @xcite to building voting equipment where diverse functionality is bundled together into the same hardware components .",
    "they propose a highly * modular architecture * , dubbed _",
    "frog voting _ , which clearly partitions processes such as voter registration , vote recording , casting , tallying , and auditing , thereby reducing complexity , simplifying certification , and encouraging incremental innovation .",
    "rivest and wack have proposed the principle of * software independence * @xcite urging that the integrity of election results should not be dependent on the software used by the system .",
    "popoveniuc et al .",
    "@xcite also detail a series of security checks which ensure e2e verifiability properties of a voting system .",
    "a second major direction of research has been to improve individual components of voting systems .",
    "there is a significant body of work on * securing electronic voting machines*. for instance , researchers have proposed the use of trusted hardware , i.e. specialized tamper - proof chips which protect cryptographic credentials and guarantee that voting machines run trusted software @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "researchers have also identified critical security properties that voting machines must ensure , and proposed corresponding solutions @xcite @xcite .",
    "another key component in e2e voting systems is the * public bulletin board * and various solutions have been put forward to implement it @xcite @xcite and make it robust against attacks @xcite @xcite .",
    "* online voting * has also received considerable attention",
    ". proposed methods to defeat hackers and malware include the use of visual cryptography techniques @xcite , captchas @xcite , voice recognition @xcite , and deploying assistive handheld devices @xcite .",
    "however , voter privacy and coercion concerns still persist .",
    "unfortunately , most of these solutions have been proposed piecemeal and it is unclear if and how they will fit together .",
    "there have been very few attempts , like votebox ( described earlier in sec .",
    "[ sec : votebox ] ) , to harmonize these various innovations in the context of a complete e2e voting system .",
    "substantial work is still needed in this domain before e2e voting systems are deployed for mainstream use .",
    "the importance of usability for a voting system can not be emphasized enough and usability oftentimes conflicts with security properties .",
    "ensuring system usability is also complicated by the fact that elections occur only rarely and voters must be able to vote with near 100% success while having little or no experience or training on that voting system .",
    "this problem also extends to poll workers and election officials who may have limited technical expertise and experience regarding certain systems . for these reasons ,",
    "the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) has advocated a broad all - encompassing perspective to study usability within the context of the complete voting system , including the physical environment , the voting product , the ballot , the voter , and all personnel involved in the process @xcite .    at this particular stage in the development of e2e voting systems , the central usability concerns are whether voters can successfully cast their votes using these systems , and more importantly , whether or not they are able to undertake the verification process .",
    "regarding vote casting , evidence suggests that certain design features of these systems are problematic . in one study , the ballot design of prt  voter , requiring voters to shred half of their ballot to ensure vote privacy caused confusion @xcite . a preliminary study involving helios , prt  voter , and scantegrity ii found that a significant number of voters failed to cast a vote with each system @xcite .",
    "troublingly , many of those voters thought they had in fact successfully cast a vote .",
    "it also took almost twice as long to cast a ballot as with a traditional paper - based system .",
    "individual vote verification is a new and novel concept for voters and adds a layer of complexity .",
    "critically , voters are active participants in auditing the election and certifying its results , and if , for whatever reason they are unable to verify their votes , the system s security guarantees become mute and the system is not auditable .",
    "recent testing and ` live ' applications of e2e systems have resulted not just in consistently low rates of voter verification but even lower rates for those who actually report discrepancies @xcite @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to two reasons .",
    "first , voters do not see the need to verify their vote .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that * trust - transference * from election authorities to voter does not happen . as",
    "olembo et al .",
    "@xcite discovered , voters may initially verify their vote out of curiosity , but after continued use of the system , they establish trust in the system and verification is deemed unnecessary . in line with this conclusion , recent usability testing involving helios and a galois - designed prototype based on star - vote , found that participants had a tacit level of trust in any voting system provided it was officially branded e.g. _ jurisdiction x official election website _ @xcite .",
    "the participants considered verification unnecessary if a voting system met this basic criterion .",
    "the second concern is complexity .",
    "the verification process of helios has repeatedly been found to be difficult @xcite @xcite .",
    "the reasons may be technical or even that the voters may not understand what to do since the verification language is not related to prior voting experience on their part .",
    "research suggests that terms like `` audit '' , `` verifiability '' , or `` ballot fingerprint '' lack clarity for voters , cause confusion , and do not engender trust in the voting system @xcite .",
    "this is critical as voters need to understand the necessity of verification to be motivated to invest the extra effort in verifying their vote .",
    "the intuition behind verification also needs to be effectively communicated .",
    "as schneider et al .",
    "discovered in their study concerning prt  voter , simply confirming that an encrypted vote on a bulletin board corresponded to a receipt did not provide sufficient security guarantees for voters themselves @xcite .",
    "several technical solutions have been proposed in the literature , including simplifying security elements or enhancing voting systems to facilitate individual vote verification @xcite @xcite , bundling multiple receipts to enable mass verification @xcite , or involving third parties in the process , such as activist groups or helper organizations , @xcite @xcite , but these require further study from a usability perspective .",
    "overall , research in the usability of e2e voting systems is still in an early stage and significant work is needed to demonstrate that these systems are accessible to non - expert users while simultaneously maintaining the desired security properties .",
    "it is a common perception that numerous attempts to introduce new voting technology , for example in britain , finland , ireland , and quebec , have failed in large part due to the absence of a comprehensive supporting legal framework @xcite . indeed , many of the issues regarding new voting technologies are not due to the technology itself , but rather the lack of ancillary processes that establish trust in the voting system . a new paradigm , like e2e voting , requires legislators to craft an appropriate legal framework that embeds election norms and details administrative procedures to address risks , problems , and threats .",
    "this includes aspects such as testing requirements , implementation instructions , and processes for problem resolution .",
    "a useful guiding principle in constructing a legal framework is that of * functional equivalence*. any new legal framework must essentially function in an equivalent way to the legal framework for existing voting systems , i.e. the new framework must be at least as good , if not better , than the old one . towards this end , legislators need to identify the distinct purposes served by existing voting systems and ensure that new rules also address the same needs .",
    "applying this criterion to e2e voting systems requires consideration that current electoral values and community expectations are preserved , while making specific legislative changes to ensure that voting experiences using e2e voting systems are as good as or better than existing procedures .",
    "another overarching concept is that of * nondiscrimination * @xcite .",
    "a new legal framework should not have the unintended consequence of discriminating against any voter .",
    "for instance , in the united states , any electronic technology , including voting equipment , needs to be section 508 compliant @xcite , i.e. it must attempt to fully accommodate disability groups . if e2e voting systems can not successfully cater to certain voter groups , legislation must set out clear alternatives to avoid discriminatory legal challenges .",
    "a good example is the case of absentee voting , where eligibility requirements are defined , permitting certain groups to cast their votes remotely .",
    "furthermore , legislation should not unduly limit technological choices to certain vendors or technology in cases where a better technology or solution exists .",
    "excessive detail in legislation can inhibit innovation and create legal _ technology locks _ @xcite .",
    "an additional function of a legal framework is to * minimize and mediate error and risk*. no electoral mechanism , be it electronic or paper , is ever absolutely secure from every possible error or risk , and the greater question is whether the regulatory framework provides voters and political stakeholders confidence that risk is minimized and contingencies are in place to cover the range of possible circumstances .    regarding specific properties to be included in legislation , schwartz and grice detail the following * normative values * addressing electronic voting systems @xcite :    * accessibility and facilitate reasonable accommodation * voter anonymity *",
    "fairness * accurate and prompt results * comprehensible and transparent processes * system security and risk assessment * detection of problems and remedial contingencies * legislative certainty and finality * effective and independent oversight * cost justification and efficiency    many of these values could be embedded into a legal framework in the form of technological choices within the specifications of an e2e voting system .",
    "for instance , to deter coercion , voters may be permitted to change or update their vote once it has been cast , as is the case of elections in estonia @xcite .",
    "similarly , if multiple modes of voting are available , legislation may specify that an electronic vote can be revoked if the voter casts a paper ballot .",
    "other technological specifications that may be considered election norms include the capability to detect undervotes and overvotes on marked ballots prior to casting and the ability to cast a blank ballot as a protest vote without it being considered technically invalid .",
    "it should be recognized that constructing a legal framework involves trade - offs between competing norms .",
    "an illustrative example is the case of dutch voters and the rijnland internet election system ( ries ) @xcite , an online voting system used for the rijnland district water board elections in 2004 . in the interest of transparency ,",
    "most of the ries technology was made open - source .",
    "ries provides a degree of verifiability but weak privacy . upon voting ,",
    "the system generated a technical code , enabling voters to verify their vote was included in the tally .",
    "however , if a voter disclosed her code , any third party could determine her actual vote . in terms of norms , therefore , transparency trumped voter privacy . whereas this particular example may not directly apply to most e2e voting systems , where cryptography obfuscates the contents of the voter receipt , it is indicative of the conflicts legislators will have to wrestle with in preparing a legal framework for these new systems .      broadly speaking , uptake of a new voting system depends on how successfully it incorporates existing election norms , and equally importantly , how effectively this perception is communicated to voters .",
    "research on internet voting lists four factors which may serve as a good starting point to discuss the uptake of e2e voting systems @xcite .",
    "these are security , privacy , accountability , and economic feasibility .    regarding security and privacy , in sec .",
    "[ sec : securitypropertiesofvotingsystems ] we have already motivated the fundamental requirement for voting systems to ensure vote privacy and election integrity . however , security also needs to be considered in terms of * reliability * , i.e. how a system isolates and reacts to failure .",
    "while a comprehensive legal framework will considerably ameliorate failure reaction , a voting system should be designed so that there is no single point of failure . as a risk assessment of large - scale events notes @xcite : ` if failure in one part of an information system can cause failure in other interconnected parts , then the system is susceptible to cascade failure ' .",
    "furthermore , in the words of pieters and becker @xcite : `` it is not only important that a system is reliable , it is also important that people believe that the system is reliable . ''",
    "fostering a common understanding of the risks associated with a voting system may actually advance acceptance .",
    "risk exists even in paper - based elections but these are generally known , accepted , and tolerated risks .",
    "transparency and accountability are key to minimizing risk , and risk perception , by detailing and perhaps even publicly demonstrating potential risks and corresponding remedies .",
    "the legal framework should require the electoral authority to establish a set of procedures and tests to be completed before the voting system goes live .",
    "additionally , procedures should be legislated that provide solutions for potential risks and these should be updated before each election to ensure protection against new threats or vulnerabilities .",
    "moreover , comprehensive and high quality voter instruction is critical to uptake of a new system and typically falls under the auspices of the legal framework ensuring equal access .",
    "voter education is particularly important for a new paradigm like e2e voting .",
    "these systems are radically different from existing systems that voters are accustomed to , the intuition behind certain procedural steps may not be immediately clear , and they have been known to confuse voters @xcite @xcite @xcite . furthermore , these systems task voters with the extra responsibility of vote verification , the necessity of which needs to be adequately explained and motivated .",
    "dissemination of this instruction can take many forms , including programs to educate the general public about e2e voting systems via various media , supplying user - friendly instructions , public demonstrations of the technology , and maintaining phone help - lines to walk voters through the voting and verification processes .",
    "in this chapter we have undertaken a comprehensive introduction to the burgeoning field of end - to - end verifiable voting .",
    "we have traced the development of privacy and verifiability properties in the literature and described the workings of current state - of - the - art e2e voting systems . in our classification , we have attempted to track the intellectual evolution of these systems and highlight the key cryptographic and procedural techniques employed by their designers to harmonize security and usability concerns .",
    "we have also discussed current challenges to the deployment of these systems , consisting of outstanding technical , legal , and usability issues .",
    "advances in e2e verifiable voting have the potential to restore trust in elections and improve democratic processes in society and , for that reason , we believe that the importance of these developments must not be underestimated .",
    "our intention , in writing this chapter , has been to make the important innovations in this field accessible to a wider audience .",
    "we hope our work serves as a useful resource in this regard and assists in the future development of e2e voting .",
