    "( hd 161797 = hip 86974 = wds 17465 + 2743 ) is the third closest quadruple star system to the sun @xcite at a distance of 8.3 pc @xcite .",
    "the system consists of the g5iv primary @xcite surrounded by several m dwarfs .",
    "the closest companion is the ab component , which has long been known from astrometric variations of the primary @xcite and from radial velocity ( rv ) variations @xcite .",
    "the companion was first imaged by @xcite with the adaptive optics ( ao ) system on the 2.5 m telescope at mt .",
    "wilson observatory .",
    "there is also the bc pair , which is separated from the primary by 35  and is a pair of m dwarfs in a 43.127@xmath20.013 yr period @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite concluded that the pair was physically bound to @xmath0  her due to common proper motion .",
    "there is also a wider d component with a separation of several hundred arcseconds , which is also an m dwarf .",
    "@xcite concluded that this is not a physical companion because the proper motion differs dramatically from that of the primary .",
    "while binary stars are common , 50%@xmath24% of f6-g2 stars have companions @xcite , quadruples are much less common .",
    "quadruples come in two major catagories , 3@xmath41 systems , where a fourth star orbits a triple system in a wide orbit and , 2 + 2 systems , which consist of two binaries orbiting a common center of mass .",
    "her is the latter type , which is the more common type @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that 10% of nearby solar - type stellar binaries were actually 2 + 2 quadruples and this is likely linked to stellar system formation processes .",
    "the @xmath0 her system is one of the best - studied 2 + 2 quadrupole systems ; therefore it serves as an archetype for understanding stellar system formation .",
    "improving the characterization of this system is the motivation for this analysis .",
    "the primary star in the system exhibits solar - like oscillations @xcite and these have been used to measure the mass of the primary @xcite using asteroseimology ( see section [ orbit_analysis ] ) .",
    "a mass determination from an orbital analysis will serve as a useful crosscheck between these two techniques and can be used to improve the theoretical modeling of observed oscillation frequencies @xcite .    the nature of the @xmath0  her ab companion has been discussed for over 20 years .",
    "most indications are that it is an m - dwarf , but there are persistent possibilities that it is substellar .",
    "@xcite used a monte carlo technique to compute probability density functions of the mass of the close companion to @xmath0  her  a based on limited rv data and hypothetical , future , single measurements of the angular separation .",
    "the study concluded that if the separation was 14 then the companion would have a probable mass on the boundary between substellar and stellar .",
    "the angular separation measurements of @xcite fell at the boundary between the two regimes . from the computed @xmath5-band magnitude of the companion",
    ", they determined that the companion had to be redder than an m5v and could be substellar as @xcite suggested .",
    "@xcite also observed the companion in the near - infrared with the mt .",
    "wilson ao system .",
    "they were able to measure the photometry of the companion in @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters . using the _ ri _ photometry from @xcite and their _",
    "hk _ photometry and model atmospheres they conclude that the mass should be @xmath80.13 @xmath9 ( equivalent to an m5v ; @xcite ) .",
    "they note that the _ ri _ photometry is anomalously bright compared to the model , though the near - infrared photometry agreed with the models to within the error bars .",
    "they concluded that the companion is stellar .",
    "@xcite observed the system with the mmt in the mid - infrared and estimated the spectral class of the companion to be m4@xmath21 . combining their results with that of @xcite",
    ", they computed the ( _ k_-_m _ ) color and noted that it was too red for an m4v star , but was similar to an early t - dwarf . with the possibility that the companion was a brown dwarf , we set out to resolve the prior conflicting color information and determine its spectral type with near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "we also collected multi - epoch astrometry to compute an resolved orbit for the system , allowing for the estimation of the individual masses of the objects .",
    "we observed @xmath0  her at the advanced electro - optical system ( aeos ) 3.6 m telescope with the site ao system and the visible imager ( visim ) camera @xcite on two separate dates : 2003 july 6 and 2005 april 24 . both data sets consist of 1000 frames using a bessel _ i_-band filter .",
    "after collection , any saturated frames were discarded and the remaining frames were debiased , dark subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "the frames were weighted by their peak pixel , which is proportional to their strehl ratio and then co - added using a shift - and - add routine .",
    "the resulting image was analyzed with the program _",
    "fitstars _ @xcite .",
    "the 2005 image is shown in figure [ images]b .",
    "error bars on the astrometry and photometry were assigned using the method in @xcite .",
    "the extracted astrometry and differential photometry are given in table [ astrometry ] .",
    "the table lists the our new results as well as prior measures of the system .",
    "the table gives the ut besselian date of the observation , the measured position angle ( @xmath10 ) , the measured separation ( @xmath11 ) , the differential magnitude and the filter used for the observation .",
    "the final column is either the instrument that was used for the observation or a reference if it was a literature result .",
    "the table does not include null results from the literature .",
    "we used the project 1640 ( p1640 ) coronagraph @xcite mounted on the palm-3000 ao system @xcite at the palomar 5 m telescope to observe @xmath0  her three times in 2012 and 2015 . during the observations",
    "the primary was placed behind the occulting disk .",
    "the first 2012 data set used the astrometric grid spots @xcite , allowing the measurement of the astrometry of the companion even though the primary is occulted by the coronagraph .",
    "two nights later on 2012 june 14 ut , we collected an additional data set , but this time the astrometric grid spot was not used and we were unable to measure the astrometry of this data set .",
    "our final observation was on 2015 march 31 ut and it used the astrometric grid spots .",
    "all the data were reduced using the project 1640 data reduction pipeline described in @xcite . since then",
    ", a few upgrades have been made to the pipeline that reduce lenslet - lenslet cross talk .",
    "the pipeline processing produces an image of the object in each of 32 wavebands , resulting in a data cube .",
    "the astrometric grid spots produce four spots on each frame of the data cube .",
    "the location of the spots is dependent on the wavelength of the frame . to measure the astrometry",
    "we fit a gaussian to each of the four astrometric grid spots .",
    "then we identified the location of the primary by fitting lines to the vertical and the horizontal spots .",
    "the primary is located where these two lines intersect .",
    "the final astrometry is the average of all the astrometry measured from 29 of the data slices from both of the image cubes with grid spots .",
    "we only use 29 image slices because several images in the atmospheric water bands did not produce meaningful results due to poor signal .",
    "the plate scale and position angle offset of the detector were computed from observations of calibration binaries taken during each observing run .",
    "the astrometry is presented in table [ astrometry ] .",
    "we also collected near - ir images of the system on multiple dates using the pharo near - infrared camera @xcite .",
    "like p1640 , pharo is also mounted on the palm-3000 ao system on the 5  m hale telescope .",
    "we collected data on 29 august 2013 ut , 14 may 2014 ut and 31 march 2015 ut . all observations used the 25  field of view with a pixel scale of 25 mas pixel@xmath12 .",
    "the observations used a variety of near - ir filters .",
    "after collection , each frame was debiased , sky subtracted , and flat fielded .",
    "we again used the @xmath13 algorithm to measure the astrometry and photometry of the binary and assigned error bars using the technique described in @xcite    we also examined archival pharo observations .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath0  her in 2002 june with pharo in coronagraphic mode in _ ks _ filter .",
    "it was not originally detected with the automated detection algorithm due to nearby residual light from the central star s characteristic `` waffle pattern '' , which the algorithm interpreted as a high noise level in that localized region of the image .",
    "a visual inspection of the archival image clearly shows the companion .",
    "the companion s relative astrometry was extracted by visual inspection .",
    "uncertainties were dominated by the ability to determine the center star s position behind the coronagraphic mask .",
    "we conservatively assigned a 2 pixel ( 008 ) uncertainty in the center star s position ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we located images of @xmath0  her aa , ab in the archives of the keck ii telescope .",
    "the keck ii data were collected with nirspec s slit camera ( scam ) @xcite in ao mode on 2001 may 15 ut with the nirspec-7 filter with a central wavelength of 2.222  and a fwhm of 0.805 .",
    "we were unable to identify any calibration data for scam for the 2001 data .",
    "in the images the star was placed in different positions across the image . to calibrate the images",
    ", we fit a plane to each image and subtracted it off .",
    "we then subtracted off a median of all the deplaned images .",

    "this was estimated from multiple epochs of low - resolution near - infrared spectra of the companion .",
    "in addition we have computed a combined visual and spectroscopic orbit for the system , producing a mass estimate for the secondary which is in agreement with the expected mass of a m4v star .",
    "much of the previous confusion about the stellar versus sub - stellar nature of @xmath0  her ab comes from combining photometric results from different observations .",
    "while that is normally a fine practice , in this case it proved to be a problem .",
    "the near - infrared photometry of @xcite appears to be incorrect as it does not agree with the numerous pharo observations in h and ks nor the nirspec / scam observation at 2.2 .",
    "yet their estimate of the spectral type of the companion from h - k color agrees with ours from near - infrared spectroscopy . it may be that there was an offset in the photometry from both filters",
    "this would also explain the anomalous @xmath29 color computed by @xcite from their mid - ir data combined with the @xcite near - infrared photometry , which they reported as too red for a m4v star .",
    "we have computed a preliminary orbit for the @xmath0  her aa , ab binary .",
    "a continuing effort is needed to collect additional astrometric and radial velocity measurements of the system to improve the orbit determination .",
    "additional rv data in the near future would be especially useful as the system has most likely just undergone an inflection point in the rv curve .",
    "additional data will produce a more accurate estimate of the masses of the two stars .",
    "the mass of the primary can then be compared against the mass of the primary measured from asteroseimology .",
    "combining independent observations with asteroseismology is crucial to advance progress in the theoretical modeling of observed oscillation frequencies , and the validation of asteroseismic relations to derive fundamental stellar properties @xcite .",
