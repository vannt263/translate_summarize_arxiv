    "we now have several methods at our disposal for probing the expansion history of the universe , but none better than the use of type ia supernovae ( perlmutter et al . 1998 , 1999 ;",
    "garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; riess et al . 1998 ) . producing a relatively well - known luminosity ,",
    "these events function as reasonable standard candles , under the assumption that the power of both near and distant events can be standardized with the same luminosity versus color and light - curve shape relationships .    over the past decade ,",
    "the combined efforts of several groups have led to an impressive accumulation of events and an ever improving quality of individual measurements .",
    "more recently , kowalski et al . ( 2008 ) devised a framework for analyzing such data sets in a homogeneous manner , creating an evolving compilation currently known as the union2.1 sample ( see suzuki et al .",
    "2012 for its most recent incarnation ) , which contains 580 supernova detections . at the highest redshifts ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the hubble space telescope plays a key role , not only in discovering new events , but also in providing high - precision optical and near - ir lightcurves ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "2004 ; kuznetsova et al . 2008 ; dawson et al . 2009 ) .",
    "while at lower redshifts , extensive surveys from the ground continue to grow the sample at a sustainably high rate ( see references cited in suzuki et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "these events constrain cosmological parameters through a comparison of their apparent luminosities with those predicted by models over a range of redshifts .",
    "the key point of this exercise is that models with different expansion histories predict specific ( and presumably distinguishable ) distance vs. redshift relationships , which one may match to the observations for a comparative analysis .",
    "the consensus today appears to be that @xmath1cdm offers the best explanation for the redshift - luminosity distribution seen in these events , and observational work is now focused primarily on refining the fits to improve the precision with which the model parameters are determined .    when these efforts are viewed through the prism of a more comprehensive cosmological study , however , the situation is not quite so simple .",
    "the reason is that although @xmath1cdm does very well in accounting for the properties of type ia supernovae , it does poorly in attempts to explain several other equally important observations , particularly the angular distribution of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the clustering of matter .",
    "for example , the angular correlation function of the cmb is so different from what @xmath1cdm predicts that the probability of it providing the correct expansion history of the universe near recombination is less than @xmath5@xmath6 ( copi et al .",
    "2009 ; melia 2012b ) . and insofar as the matter distribution",
    "is concerned , @xmath1cdm predicts a distribution profile that changes with scale , seemingly at odds with the observed near universal power - law seen everywhere below the bao scale ( @xmath7 mpc ) , leading watson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to categorize it as a  cosmic coincidence . \"",
    "this disparity is the principal topic we wish to address in this paper , with a particular emphasis on what the @xmath3 universe has to say about the universal expansion implied by the type ia supernova data . as we have shown in earlier papers ( see , e.g. , melia 2007 , 2012a , 2012b , 2012c , 2012d ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) , and summarized in  2 below",
    ", the @xmath3 universe is more effective than @xmath1cdm in accounting for the properties of the cmb .",
    "this raises the question of whether @xmath1cdm is really revealing something different about the local universe  as opposed to what happened much earlier , closer to the time of last scattering  or whether it is possible for us to understand how and why it may simply be mimicking the expansion history suggested by the @xmath3 universe at low redshifts .",
    "this is not an easy question to address , principally because of the enormous amount of work that goes into first establishing the supernova magnitudes , and then carefully fitting the data using the comprehensive set of parameters available to @xmath1cdm . as we shall see in  3 below , part of the problem",
    "is that the distance moduli themselves can not be determined completely independently of the assumed model .",
    "this leads to the unpalatable situation in which the data tend to be somewhat compliant , producing slightly better fits for the input model than might otherwise occur if they were completely model independent . but",
    "even with these complications , we will show below that @xmath1cdm appears to fit the supernova data well because its seven free parameters allow it to relax to the @xmath3 universe at low redshifts . in other words",
    ", we suggest that fits to the union2.1 sample can not , by themselves , distinguish between @xmath1cdm and the @xmath3 universe .",
    "the preponderance of evidence therefore rests with the cmb , which appears to favor the @xmath3 cosmology .",
    "the @xmath3 universe is an frw cosmology that adheres very closely to the restrictions imposed on the theory by the cosmological principle and weyl s postulate ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) .",
    "most people realize that adopting the cosmological principle means we assume the universe is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "but many do nt know that this is only a statement about the structure of the universe at any given cosmic time @xmath8 . in order to complete the rationale for the frw form of the metric",
    ", one also needs to know how the time slices at different @xmath8 relate to each other . in other words , one needs to know whether or not the cosmological principle is maintained from one era to the next . and",
    "this is where weyl s postulate becomes essential , for it introduces the equally important assumption about how the various worldlines propagate forwards in time .",
    "weyl s postulate says that no two worldlines in the hubble flow ever cross . small , local crossings are , of course , always possible , and we understand that these are due to small departures from an overall hubble expansion .",
    "but on large scales , the assumption that worldlines never cross places a severe restriction on how the distance between any two points can change with time .",
    "this is the origin of the relationship between the so - called proper distance @xmath9 in frw cosmologies and the universal expansion factor @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 , in terms of the unchanging co - moving distance @xmath12 .",
    "but what has not been recognized until recently is that when these two basic tenets are taken seriously , they force the gravitational horizon @xmath13 ( more commonly known as the hubble radius ) to always equal @xmath14 .",
    "( the proof of this is straightforward and may be found , e.g. , in melia & shevchuk 2012 , and in the more pedagogical treatment of melia 2012a . )",
    "it is not difficult to see that this equality in turn forces the expansion rate to be constant , so the expansion factor @xmath10 appearing in the friedmann equations must be @xmath15 ( utilizing the convention that @xmath16 today ) , where @xmath17 is the current age of the universe .    over the past several decades",
    ", @xmath1cdm has developed into a comprehensive description of nature , which nonetheless is not entirely consistent with this approach .",
    "instead , @xmath1cdm assumes a set of primary constituents ( radiation , matter , and an unspecified dark energy ) , and adopts a partitioning among these components that is not theoretically well motivated .",
    "@xmath1cdm is therefore an empirical cosmology , deriving many of its traits from observations . the problem with this , however , is that the observations are quite varied and cover disparate properties of the universe , some early in its history ( as seen in the fossilized cmb ) and others more recently ( such as the formation of large - scale structure and the aforementioned distribution of type ia supernovae ) .    in recent work ,",
    "we have demonstrated why this approach may be useful in establishing a basis for theoretical cosmology , but why in the end @xmath1cdm essentially remains an approximation to the more precise theory embodied in the @xmath3 universe .",
    "what is lacking in @xmath1cdm is the overall equation of state , @xmath18 , linking the total pressure @xmath19 and the total energy density @xmath20 .",
    "this simple relationship is required when the cosmological principle and the weyl postulate are adopted together . in consequence ,",
    "@xmath1cdm may  fit \" the data in certain restricted redshift ranges , but it fails in other limits .",
    "for example , @xmath13 in @xmath1cdm fluctuates about the mean it would otherwise always have ( since it must always be equal to @xmath14 ) , leading to the awkward situation in which the value of @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 today , but in order to achieve this  coincidence \" , the universe had to decelerate early on , followed by a more recent acceleration that exactly balanced out the effects of its slowing down at the beginning . in    4 and 5",
    ", we shall see how this balancing act functions in a more quantitative manner ( particularly when fitting the type ia supernova data ) , and we shall actually learn that the cancellation is even more contrived than it seems at first blush .",
    "the problems with @xmath1cdm begin right at the outset because of its implied deceleration just after the big bang .",
    "this slowing down brings it into direct conflict with the near uniformity of the cmb data ( see , e.g. , melia 2012a ) , requiring the introduction of an ad hoc inflationary phase to rescue it . as shown in melia ( 2012b ) , however",
    ", the recent assessment of the observed angular correlation function @xmath23 in the cmb simply does not support any kind of inflationary scenario .",
    "we showed in that paper that , whereas @xmath1cdm fails to account for the observed shape of @xmath23particularly the absence of any correlation at angles greater than @xmath5@xmath24the @xmath3 universe explains where @xmath23 attains its minimum value ( at @xmath25 ) , the correlation amplitude @xmath26 at that angle and , most importantly , why there is no angular correlation at large angles .",
    "the chief ingredient in @xmath1cdm responsible for this failure to account for the properties of @xmath23 is inflation , which would have expanded all fluctuations to very large scales . instead",
    ", the @xmath3 universe did not undergo such an accelerated expansion , so its largest fluctuations are limited to the size of the gravitational horizon @xmath27 at the time of last scattering .",
    "to be completely fair to the standard model , however , we also point out that in spite of its failure to account for the distribution of large - scale fluctuations in the cmb , it does very well in explaining the large-@xmath28 power spectrum associated with fluctuations on scales below @xmath29 . and",
    "recent observations provide an even more convincing confirmation of the large-@xmath28 spectrum predicted by @xmath1cdm ( see , e.g. , hlozek et al .",
    "more work needs to be carried out to fully understand this disparity .",
    "it could be that unlike the sachs - wolfe effect , the physical processes ( such as acoustic fluctuations ) influencing the small - scale behavior are much less dependent on the expansion scenario .",
    "there is a hint that this may be happening from the analysis of scott et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who demonstrated that the same large-@xmath28 power spectrum can result from rather different cosmological models .",
    "the cmb carries significant weight in determining which of the candidate models accounts for the universal expansion , and here we have a situation in which @xmath1cdm can not explain the near uniformity of the cmb across the sky without inflation , yet with inflation it can not account for the anisotropy of the cmb on large scales .",
    "this distinction alone already demonstrates the superiority of the @xmath30 universe over @xmath1cdm , insofar as the interpretation of the cmb observations is concerned .",
    "but this is only one of several crucial tests affirming the conclusion that @xmath1cdm is only an approximation to the more precise @xmath3 universe . here",
    "are several other reasons :    @xmath31 the @xmath3 universe explains why it makes sense to infer a planck mass scale in the early universe by equating the schwarzschild radius to the compton wavelength . in @xmath1cdm",
    "there is no justifiable reason why a delimiting gravitational horizon should be invoked in an otherwise infinite universe ( see melia 2012a for a more pedagogical explanation ) .",
    "@xmath31 the @xmath3 universe explains why @xmath32 today ( because they are always equal ) . in @xmath1cdm ,",
    "this equality is just one of many coincidences . as we shall see in subsequent sections of this paper",
    ", this awkwardness will become apparent in how the free parameters in @xmath1cdm must be manipulated in order to fit the type ia supernova data ( see , e.g. , figure  4 ) .",
    "@xmath31 the @xmath3 universe explains how opposite sides of the cmb could have been in equilibrium at the time ( @xmath33 years ) of recombination , without the need to introduce an ad hoc period of inflation .",
    "inflation may be useful for other reasons , but it does not appear to be necessary in order to solve a non - existent  horizon problem \" ( melia 2012d ) .",
    "@xmath31 the @xmath3 universe explains why there is no apparent length scale below the bao wavelength ( @xmath7 mpc ) in the observed matter correlation function . in their exhaustive study , watson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) concluded that the observed power - law galaxy correlation function below the bao is simply not consistent with the predictions of @xmath1cdm , which requires different clustering profiles of matter on different spatial scales .",
    "these authors suggested , therefore , that the galaxy correlation function must be a  cosmic coincidence . \" but this is not the case in the @xmath3 universe because this cosmology does not possess a jeans length ( melia & shevchuk 2012 ) .",
    "since @xmath18 , the active gravitational mass ( @xmath34 ) in the @xmath3 universe is zero , so fluctuations grow as a result of ( negative ) pressure only , without any delimiting spatial scale .",
    "@xmath31 the fact that @xmath20 is partitioned into @xmath35 matter and @xmath36 dark energy is a mystery in @xmath1cdm .",
    "but in the @xmath3 universe , it is clear why @xmath37 must be @xmath35 , because when one forces @xmath20 to have the specific constituents @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , only the value @xmath41 will permit the universe to evolve in just the right way to satisfy the condition @xmath32 today .",
    "this condition is always satisfied in the @xmath3 universe , but not in @xmath1cdm . yet",
    "the observations today must be consistent with this constraint imposed by the cosmological principle and the weyl postulate , so all the other evolutionary aspects of the @xmath1cdm cosmology must comply with this requirement .",
    "@xmath31 the observed near alignment of the cmb quadrupole and octopole moments is a statistically significant anomaly for @xmath1cdm , but merely lies within statistically reasonable expectations in the @xmath3 universe ( melia 2012c ) .",
    "this again has to do with the finite fluctuation size , limited by the gravitational horizon @xmath27 at the time of last scattering .",
    "let us now briefly review the contents of the union2.1 sample , and summarize the key steps taken during its assembly . as the samples have grown and become better calibrated , evidence has emerged for a correlation between host galaxy properties and sn luminosities , after corrections are made for lightcurve width and sn color ( hicken et al .",
    "for example , type ia supernovae in early - type galaxies appear to be brighter ( by about @xmath42 mag ) than their counterparts in galaxies of later type .",
    "a similar relationship appears to exist between hubble residuals and host galaxy mass ( kelly et al .",
    "2010 ; sullivan et al . 2010",
    "; lampeitl et al .",
    "uncorrected , such relationships can lead to significant systematic error in determining the best fit cosmology .",
    "additional sources of uncertainty arise for astrophysical reasons , including the color correction that must be applied to sn luminosities .",
    "the so - called redder - fainter relation apparently arises from at least two mechanisms : extinction from interstellar dust , and probably some intrinsic relation between color and luminosity produced by the explosion itself or by the surrounding medium .",
    "it is difficult to justify the argument that this redder - fainter relationship should behave in the same way at all redshifts , but there s little else one can do because the two effects are very difficult to disentangle ( see , e.g. , suzuki 2012 ) .    combining the many available datasets into a single compilation ( the union2.1 sample ) has obvious advantages , treating all supernovae on an equal footing and using the same lightcurve fitting , but this process brings its own set of possible errors , including the fact that the systematics may be different among the various datasets . as we shall see shortly , this multitude of uncertainties makes it impossible to determine the supernova luminosities without some prior assumption about the underlying cosmological model .",
    "the procedure for determining each individual type ia supernova luminosity requires a fit to the lightcurve using three parameters ( aside from those arising in the cosmological model itself ) .",
    "these are ( 1 ) an overall normalization , @xmath43 , to the time dependent spectral energy distribution of the supernova , ( 2 ) the deviation , @xmath44 , from the average lightcurve shape , and ( 3 ) the deviation , @xmath45 , from the mean type ia supernova @xmath46 color .",
    "these three parameters , along with the assumed host mass , are then combined to form the distance modulus @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the integrated @xmath49-band flux at maximum light , @xmath50 is the absolute @xmath49-band magnitude of a type ia supernova with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . also , @xmath54 is the threshold host - galaxy mass used for the mass - dependent correction , and @xmath55 is a probability function assigning a probability that the true mass , @xmath56 , is less than the threshold value , when an actual mass measurement @xmath57 is made .",
    "it is quite evident that the task of accurately determining @xmath58 for each individual supernova is arduous indeed .",
    "the supernova cosmology project calls the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath50  nuisance \" parameters , because they can not be evaluated independently of the assumed cosmology .",
    "they must be fitted simultaneously with the other cosmological parameters , e.g. , emerging from @xmath1cdm .",
    "but this is quite a serious problem that can not be ignored , e.g. , when comparing the overall fits to the data with @xmath1cdm and the @xmath3 universe ( or any other cosmology , for that matter ) because , as we have already alluded to above , this procedure makes the data at least somewhat compliant to the assumed cosmological model .",
    "the best fit cosmology is determined by an iterative @xmath62-minimization of the function @xmath63 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_{\\rm lc}^2 + \\sigma_{\\rm ext}^2+\\sigma_{\\rm sample}^2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 stands for all the cosmological parameters that define the fitted model ( with the exception of the hubble constant @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath67 is the propagated error from the covariance matrix of the lightcurve fits . the uncertainties due to host galaxy peculiar velocities , galactic extinction corrections , and gravitational lensing are included in @xmath68 ( which is evidently of order @xmath69 mag ) , and @xmath70 is a floating dispersion term containing sample - dependent systematic errors . its value is obtained by setting the reduced @xmath62 to unity for each sample in the compilation . for the union2.1 catalog ,",
    "@xmath70 is approximately @xmath71 mag ( suzuki et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the luminosity distance is defined by the relation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the expansion factor at the present cosmic time @xmath17 , @xmath74 is the comoving distance to the source , and @xmath75 is the time at which the source at @xmath74 emitted the light we see today . in @xmath1cdm ,",
    "the density is comprised of three primary components , @xmath76 where , following convention , @xmath38 is the density due to radiation , @xmath39 is the matter density and @xmath40 represents dark energy , usually assumed to be a cosmological constant @xmath1 . dividing through by the critical density today , @xmath77 we may write @xmath78 where , in obvious notation , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .    in a spatially flat universe ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "@xmath83 , so if we assume that @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 constant then , from the geodesic equation , @xmath87 we get @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 . and changing the variable of integration to @xmath91 , we find that in @xmath1cdm @xmath92    figure  1 shows the union2.1 sample of 580 type ia supernovae , along with the best fit @xmath1cdm model , in which dark energy is a cosmological constant , @xmath1 , its equation - of - state parameter is @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "as is well known by now , the theoretical fit is excellent .",
    "in addition , for these best - fit parameters , the expansion of the universe switched from deceleration to acceleration at @xmath95 , which corresponds to a look - back time ( in the context of @xmath1cdm ) of @xmath96 gyr , roughly half the current age of the universe .",
    "equality between @xmath39 and @xmath40 occurred later , at @xmath97 , corresponding to a look - back time of about @xmath98 gyr .",
    "however , the purpose of this paper is not so much to demonstrate this well known result but , rather , to see if our suggested resolution of the disparity between the predictions of @xmath1cdm and the cmb observations is also consistent with the cosmological expansion implied by the type ia supernova data .",
    "since the @xmath3 universe is superior to @xmath1cdm in at least some fitting of the cmb data , the question now is whether it can also account for the measured expansion at lower redshifts .    for the @xmath3 universe",
    ", we have @xmath99 from which we get @xmath100 and with @xmath101 it is easy to see that @xmath102 ( where we have also used the fact that @xmath103 ) .    in carrying out a fit to the data",
    ", we note that the chosen value of the hubble constant @xmath65 is not independent of @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , one can vary either of these parameters , but not both separately . therefore , if we allow @xmath50 to remain a member of the set of variables optimized to find the  best - fit \" supernova luminosities ( as described in   3 above ) , then the @xmath3 universe has no free parameters . in contrast",
    ", @xmath1cdm has several , depending on how one chooses to treat dark energy .",
    "these include the value of @xmath37 and possibly the equation - of - state parameter @xmath104 , if dark energy is not a pure cosmological constant . in @xmath1cdm ,",
    "these parameters affect the location of the universe s transition from deceleration to acceleration , and the location where @xmath105 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to carry out a complete best - fit minimization of @xmath106 for the @xmath3 universe , which would require an optimization of all the parameters , including @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , among others .",
    "instead , we will adopt the parameters identified by the supernova cosmology project as the best - fit values for the @xmath1cdm model shown in figure  1 , save for one variable ",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , we will still determine a best fit to the data using the @xmath3 cosmology , but only by minimizing @xmath106 with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "this is not ideal , of course , because the fit would be even better , were we to allow all of the available parameters to vary , but even this very simplified approach is sufficient to prove our point and it is easy to digest , so it should suffice for now .    the @xmath3 distance profile is compared to the union2.1 data in figure  2 .",
    "the optimization procedure we have just described results in a ",
    "best - fit \" value for @xmath50 that is @xmath107 mag greater than that obtained with @xmath1cdm .",
    "however , for this illustration , all the other parameters are identical to those calculated for @xmath1cdm ( resulting in the fit shown in figure  1 ) . for completeness",
    ", we also show the hubble diagram residuals corresponding to the @xmath3 cosmology in figure  3 .",
    "the fits are so similar that even if there were nt any direct relationship between the two cosmologies , one would have to suspect that there exists yet another  cosmic coincidence \" in @xmath1cdm .",
    "but we will now argue that in fact this is not a coincidence  that @xmath1cdm is merely relaxing to the @xmath3 universe when all of its parameters are optimized to fit the data . to help with this discussion ,",
    "let us look at the two distance vs. redshift profiles side by side in figure  4 .",
    "several characteristics of this comparison are rather striking .",
    "first , the two curves are virtually identical , and not only at low redshifts , but all the way out to @xmath108 or more .",
    "they differ slightly around @xmath109 , which should not be surprising given that the two luminosity distances ( equations  9 and 13 ) depend quite differently on the assumed parameters . yet , with all the possible deviations one might have expected between these two formulations with increasing @xmath110 , one instead sees that @xmath1cdm is forced to track @xmath3 over the entire redshift range .",
    "second , a big deal is made of the fact that in @xmath1cdm , the cosmological expansion switched from deceleration to acceleration at about half its current age . that in itself is a rather strange coincidence .",
    "do we really live at such a special time that we are privileged to have seen the universe decelerate for half of its existence and then accelerate for the other half , but in such a perfect balance that the two effects exactly canceled out ?",
    "the reasonable answer to this question is clearly no .",
    "and we can see in figure  4 what must be happening .",
    "since the @xmath3 constraint is imposed on the universe by the cosmological principle and the weyl postulate , even in @xmath1cdm the cosmological distance scale must comply globally with this condition .",
    "so if the imperfect formulation of @xmath66 in equation  9 first forces a decelerated expansion , a compensating acceleration must take place later in order to reduce the overall cosmological expansion back to @xmath3 as @xmath111 .",
    "but if the @xmath3 curve should be the best fit to the data , why does @xmath1cdm provide such a good fit to the union2.1 sample , even at @xmath112 ?",
    "we suggest that the problem lies with the so - called  nuisance \" variables used to determine the supernova luminosities .",
    "when @xmath1cdm is fit to the data , these variables are optimized along with the other parameters defining the cosmological model ( what we called @xmath64 in   3 ) . with so much flexibility ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath50 )",
    ", the distance moduli can not be determined without the assumption of an underlying cosmology . and if @xmath106 is minimized by varying all of the parameters simultaneously , it should not be surprising to see the data complying with the model .",
    "a very important contribution to this discussion was made recently by seikel & schwarz ( 2009 ) , who improved the analysis of type ia sn data by eliminating some of the uncertainties arising from specific model fitting . instead of performing a routine @xmath113 fit using equation  ( 2 ) , they considered the redshift dependence of the quantity @xmath114 averaged over redshift bins .",
    "each @xmath114 is defined to be the difference between the measured distance modulus of event @xmath115 and the value it would have had at that redshift if the luminosity distance were calculated assuming no universal acceleration , i.e. , if it were given by equation  ( 13 ) .",
    "their goal was simply to ascertain whether or not the average @xmath116 is greater than zero  the  null \" hypothesis . a positive value would be taken as evidence of recent acceleration . by comparing these quantities at redshifts greater than 0.1 to those below , their goal was to remove as many systematic uncertainties as possible , while at the same time not restricting their analysis to any particular model .",
    "the attractive feature of this approach is that one needs only to demonstrate that @xmath117 for acceleration to have occurred , without relying on fits with a particular cosmology .",
    "interestingly , their principal conclusion was that acceleration emerges only if one includes the events at @xmath118 .",
    "quite significantly , the evidence for acceleration dramatically ( to use their own terminology ) decreases if sne with @xmath118 are not used for the test . in their careful assessment of this effect , they pointed out that a redshift of 0.1 corresponds approximately to a distance of about 400 mpc , the size of the largest observed structures in the universe .",
    "in other words , the evidence for acceleration emerges only when one includes events associated with a length scale over which the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy is probably not justified .",
    "having said this , it must be pointed out that although their approach appears to be superior to the simple @xmath113 fitting given in equation  ( 2 ) , it nonetheless also suffers from the problem we have been describing ",
    "the model - dependence of the reduced data .",
    "their @xmath114 are the differences between the measured distance moduli @xmath119 and the values these would have at the same redshift in a non - accelerated universe .",
    "unfortunately , in order to measure @xmath119 , one must pre - assume a cosmology . as described in   3 , for",
    "otherwise it is not possible to determine the 4 nuisance parameters .",
    "and when one adopts a particular cosmology , optimizing its free parameters via the fitting procedure , the nuisance parameters are themselves optimized to comply with that particular cosmology .",
    "the values of @xmath119 used by seikel & schwarz ( 2009 ) were therefore not model - independent , as they assumed .",
    "instead , they had already been optimized for @xmath1cdm , ensuring that they would show at least some vestige of acceleration relative to the null case .",
    "their work is useful nonetheless because they were apparently able to at least eliminate some of the systematic errors , and in so doing , demonstrate quite compellingly that the elimination of events associated with the inhomogeneous portion of the local universe greatly decreases the evidence for acceleration .    in any fitting procedure , whether it be a direct @xmath113 fit according to equation  ( 2 ) , or a more sophisticated approach based on seikel & schwarz s null hypothesis , what is clearly needed is a careful reduction of the data using the very same cosmology being tested .",
    "it is not correct to optimize the nuisance parameters using one model and then use them to test the predictions of another .",
    "it is our hope that such an exercise will be carried out soon for a direct comparison between @xmath1cdm and the @xmath3 universe .",
    "the analysis of type ia supernova data over the past decade has been one of the most notable success stories in cosmology . these are arguably the most reliable standard candles we have to date and offer us an unparalleled opportunity of studying the cosmological expansion , at least out to a redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "the consensus today appears to be that @xmath1cdm offers the best explanation for the luminosity - distance relationship seen in these events , and many believe that what remains to be done is simply to refine the best - fit values of the parameters that define this model",
    ".    one may therefore question the value of re - examining the merit of @xmath1cdm in these studies , and it would be difficult to justify re - testing the basic theory , were it not for the significant incompatibility emerging between the standard model and other equally important observations , such as the cmb anisotropies mapped by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this paper",
    ", we have documented several compelling reasons for believing that @xmath1cdm does not provide an accurate representation of the cosmological expansion , at least not at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it has therefore been essential to re - analyze the type ia supernova data in light of the cosmology ( the @xmath3 universe ) that best represents the universe s dynamical evolution at early times .    by directly comparing the distance - relationship in @xmath1cdm with that predicted by the @xmath3 universe , and each with the union2.1 sample , we have demonstrated that the two theories produce virtually indistinguishable profiles .",
    "if these were not related , such a close empirical kinship would suggest the emergence of yet another  cosmic coincidence \" in @xmath1cdm .",
    "instead , the fact that the best fit parameters compel @xmath1cdm to track @xmath3 so closely suggests that the former cosmology is an approximation to the latter , and relaxes to it as best as the formulation in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath104 allows it to .",
    "but because the relaxation is not perfect , @xmath1cdm accelerates in certain regions and decelerates in others , though always precisely balanced in order to guarantee a net zero acceleration over the age of the universe .",
    "were it not for the constraint imposed on the gravitational radius by the cosmological principle and the weyl postulate , this balancing act would be one more cosmic coincidence , as would the fact that the switch from deceleration to acceleration occurs at the mid - point of the universe s existence , endowing us with the remarkable privilege of viewing this transition at a very special time  one that occurs once , and once only , in the entire history of the universe .    through this exercise ,",
    "we have also highlighted the fact that the data themselves can not be determined independently of the assumed cosmological model .",
    "the fact that the supernova luminosities must be evaluated by optimizing 4 parameters simultaneously with those in the adopted model means that the resultant data are compliant to the implied cosmology .",
    "though this approach is highly unpalatable , there does nt seem to be any reasonable alternative at this time .",
    "however , the dependence of the data on the assumed model suggests that one should not ignore the model - dependent data reduction in any comparative studies between competing theories .",
    "it would therefore be highly desirable to carry out a full fitting analysis of the union2.1 sample using the @xmath30 universe , on par with the efforts already undertaken for @xmath1cdm",
    ". only then can we see whether the type ia supernova data reveal a cosmological expansion at low redshifts consistent with the dynamics implied by the cmb anisotropies , or whether they do in fact demonstrate a different behavior at early and late times in the universe s history ."
