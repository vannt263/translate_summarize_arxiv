    "@xcite@xcite where also an extensive list of references can be found , we will focus on the scaling law , called geometrical scaling ( gs ) , which has been introduced in the context of dis @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that gs is also exhibited by the @xmath3 spectra at the lhc @xcite@xcite .",
    "an onset of gs in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies has been reported in ref .  @xcite . at low bjorken @xmath4 proton",
    "is characterized by an intermediate energy scale @xmath5  called saturation scale @xcite  defined as the border line between dense and dilute gluonic systems within a proton ( for review see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for the present study , however , the details of saturation are not of primary interest , it is the very existence of @xmath5 which is of importance .",
    "here we present analysis of three different pieces of data which exhibit both emergence and violation of geometrical scaling . in sect .",
    "[ method ] we briefly describe the method used to assess the existence of gs . secondly , in sect .",
    "[ dis ] we describe our recent analysis  @xcite of combined hera data @xcite where it has been shown that gs in dis works very well up to relatively large @xmath6 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ pplhc ] , on the example of the cms @xmath1 spectra in central rapidity @xcite , we show that gs can be extended to hadronic collisions . for particles produced at non - zero rapidities , one ( larger ) bjorken @xmath7 may leave the domain of gs , _ i.e. _ @xmath8 , and violation of gs should appear . in sect .",
    "[ ppna61 ] we present analysis of very recent pp data from na61/shine experiment at cern @xcite and show that gs is indeed violated once rapidity is increased .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "geometrical scaling hypothesis means that some observable @xmath9 that in principle depends on two independent kinematical variables , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in fact depends only on a specific combination of them denoted as @xmath12 : @xmath13 here function @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ gsdef ] ) is a dimensionless function of scaling variable @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the saturation scale .",
    "here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are free parameters which can be extracted from the data within some specific model for @xmath9 , and exponent @xmath19 is a dynamical quantity of the order of @xmath20 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall test the hypothesis whether different pieces of data can be described by formula ( [ gsdef ] ) with _ constant _ @xmath19 , and what is the kinematical range where gs is working satisfactorily .    in view of eq .",
    "( [ gsdef ] ) observables @xmath21 for different @xmath22 s should fall on one universal curve , if evaluated not in terms of @xmath23 but in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "this means in turn that ratios @xmath24 should be equal to unity independently of @xmath12 . here for some @xmath25 we pick up all @xmath26 which have at least two overlapping points in @xmath11 .    for @xmath27 points of the same @xmath23 but different @xmath10 s correspond in general to different @xmath12 s .",
    "therefore one has to interpolate @xmath28 to @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .    by tuning @xmath19",
    "one can make @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . in order to find optimal value @xmath33 that minimizes deviations of ratios ( [ rxdef ] ) from unity we form",
    "the chi - square measure@xmath34 where the sum over @xmath35 extends over all points of given @xmath22 that have overlap with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is a number of such points .",
    "in the case of dis the relevant scaling observable is @xmath38 cross section and variable @xmath10 is simply bjorken @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ xlamlog ] we present 3-d plot of @xmath39 which has been found by minimizing ( [ chix1 ] ) .     obtained by minimization of eq .",
    "( [ chix1]).,width=302 ]    qualitatively , gs is given by the independence of @xmath40 on bjorken @xmath10 and by the requirement that the pertinent value of @xmath41 should be small ( for the discussion of the latter see refs .",
