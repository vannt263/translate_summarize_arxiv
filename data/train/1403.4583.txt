    "an interference channel ( ic ) is a model for communication between multiple transmitter receiver ( tx - rx ) pairs that share a common communication medium .",
    "each transmitter wishes to communicate specific information to its corresponding receiver .",
    "since the tx - rx pairs share a common communication medium , every user s signal causes interference to every other user .",
    "communication over an ic is therefore facilitated by a coding technique that manages interference efficiently , in addition to combating channel noise .",

    "the technique of aligning interference is based on carefully choosing codebooks such that the interfering signals _",

    "the single - letter distributions induced by the codes are uniform , resulting in achievability of rates corresponding to only uniform distributions .",

    "it is natural to ask whether the technique of interference alignment is applicable to only additive ic s ?",
    "more generally , do codes endowed with structure enable alignment and thereby facilitate communication over ic s that are not additive ?",
    "this article addresses these questions .",
    "in particular , we develop a coding technique based on a new ensemble of codes - partitioned coset codes ( pcc ) - possessing algebraic and empirical properties to enable alignment over arbitrary discrete memoryless ic s with three receivers ( @xmath0ic ) .",
    "we analyze the performance of the proposed coding technique to derive a new achievable rate region for the @xmath0ic .",

    "thirdly , we develop coding techniques over looser algebraic objects such as abelian groups .",
    "these elements enable us to derive a new achievable rate region for the general @xmath0ic in terms of single - letter information theoretic quantities .",
