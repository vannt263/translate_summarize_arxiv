    "they act in parallel as an ensemble of _ almost independent _ quantum molecules - microcomputers . in so doing the nuclear spins of an individual molecule",
    "are described by mixed state density matrix of _ reduced quantum ensemble . _",

    "the output oscillating voltage @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is magnetic flux produced by resonant spins in the coil ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 is solenoid inductance of the resonance counter , @xmath25 is volume of the solenoid , @xmath26 is the number and @xmath27 is area of coil turns , @xmath28 is the _ quality factor _ of resonance counter for parallel connected resistance @xmath29 ( fig .  1 ) . for resonance condition @xmath30 .",
    "the maximum nuclear spin read - out magnetization @xmath31 ( the liquid sample is considered here to be a continuous medium and to have volume @xmath32 at _ optimum resonance condition _ is defined by the amplitude of rf field @xmath33 @xcite ( see also ( 20 ) below ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is maximum equilibrium nuclear magnetization , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are effective transverse and longitudinal relaxation times , @xmath12 is number of resonant nuclear spins ( one in a molecule ) in volume @xmath25 .",
    "parameter @xmath38 is the maximum probability of the full nuclear polarization in pseudo - pure state @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "it may be estimated by the difference of equilibrium population between the lowest and the highest energy states . for nearly homonuclear @xmath13 spin system",
    "@xcite it is : @xmath40 in the high temperature limit @xmath41 we have @xmath42 , that is , the signal amplitude _ exponentially drops _ with the number of qubits , but it _ does not _ drop for @xmath43 when @xmath44 ( the pure ground nuclear spin quantum state ) .",

    "an additional increase of read - out nmr signal may be obtained in paramagnetic liquids using the endor technique .",
    "it is generally believed that for the liquid bulk - ensemble quantum computers a _ limiting value _ is @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "there are five basic criteria for realization of a _ large - scale nmr quantum computer _ , which can outperform all traditional classical computers @xcite :    1 .   for any physical system , which presents large - scale quantum register ,",
    "the necessary number of qubits in quantum register must be @xmath66 .",
    "+ one such example of this register is solid - state homonuclear system , in which nuclear spin containing identical atoms are housed at regular intervals in a natural or an artificial solid - state structure .",
    "2 .   there is a need to provide the conditions for preparation of initial basic quantum register state . for a many - qubit solid - state nmr quantum computer",
    "the quantum register state initializing can be obtained by going to _ extra - low nuclear spin temperature _ ( @xmath67 at fields of order of several tesla ) .",
    "the decoherence time of qubit states @xmath68 should be at least up to @xmath69 times longer than the ` clock time ' , that is value of order of several seconds for nmr quantum computers . _ the decoherence suppression is one of the important problems _ in realization of a large - scale quantum computers .",
    "there is a need to perform during a decoherence time a set of quantum logic operations determined by a logic unitary transformation .",
    "this set should contain certain set of the one - qubit and two - qubits operations are shielded from random errors .",
    "the electromagnetic pulses that control the quantum operation should be performed with an accuracy of better than @xmath70@xmath71 .",
    "there is a need to provide _ accurate and sensitive read - out measurements of the qubit states_. this is another of the important and hard problems .",
    "the design of solid - state nmr quantum computers was proposed by b. kane in @xcite .",
    "it was suggested to use a semiconductor mos structure on a @xmath72 spinless substrate , in a near - surface layer whose stable phosphorus isotopes @xmath0 , acting as donors , are implanted in the form of a regular chain .",
    "these donors have a nuclear spin @xmath4 and substitute for silicon atoms at the lattice sites , producing shallow impurity states .",
    "the number of donors or the qubit number @xmath13 in such a quasi - one - dimensional _ artificial ` molecule ' _ may be arbitrary large .",
    "it is suggested an _",
    "individual _ nuclear spin  qubits electrical control and measurement of qubit states through the use of special gate structures .",
    "the experimental implementation of kane s scheme is undertaken now in australian centre for quantum computer technology @xcite .",
    "however , there are four essential difficulties in implementing this quantum computer :    1 .   first of all",
    ", signal from the spin of an individual atom is very small and _ high sensitive single - spin measurements _ are required .",
    "2 .   for initialization of nuclear spin",
    "states it is required to use _ very low nuclear spin temperature _ ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is required to use regular donors and gates arrangement with high precision in _",
    "nanometer scale_. 4 .",
    "it is necessary to suppress the _ decoherence _ of quantum states defined by _ fluctuations _ of gate voltage .    as an alternative , we proposed the variant of _ an ensemble silicon - based quantum computer _ @xcite .",
    "one would expect that with the ensemble approach , where many independent ` molecules ' of kane s type work simultaneously , the measurements would be greatly simplified . here",
    "we will give some further development of this scheme .",
    "in this case , unlike the structure suggested in @xcite , gates @xmath74 and @xmath75 form a chain of narrow ( @xmath76 ) and long strips along which donor atoms at @xmath77 distant from each other are placed ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , they form a _",
    "regular _ structure of the planar silicon topology type .",
    "the structure of two qubit cells for three ensemble component .    the separation between neighboring donor atoms in si , as in kane s scheme , must be @xmath78 . in this case",
    "the interqubit interaction is controlled by gates @xmath75 .",
    "the depth of donor @xmath79 is @xmath80 . for @xmath81",
    "the exchange spin interaction between electrons of donor atoms disposed along the strip gates ( @xmath82axis ) is negligibly small .",
    "hence , such a system breaks down into an ensemble of near - independent kane s artificial ` molecule ' , whose electronic spins at temperature @xmath83 are initially fully aligned with the field of several tesla ( @xmath84 ) . as in case of liquids ,",
    "the nuclear spin states of individual kane s chain-`molecule ' will be described by density matrix of reduced quantum ensemble .",
    "access to individual qubits will be replaced by simultaneous access to related qubits in all ` molecules ' of ensemble .",
    "the linear qubit density in the artificial ` molecules ' is @xmath85 qubits on micrometer .",
    "for the realization of considered structure , as well as of the kane s scheme , _ the nanotechnology _ with resolution of the order of @xmath86 1 nm is also needed .    for _",
    "the initializing _ of all nuclear spin - qubit quantum states ( fully polarized nuclear spins ) there is a need to attain , for the time being , nuclear spin temperature @xmath87 .",
    "an output signal in this system , as in liquids , will be proportional to the number of ` molecules ' or donor atoms @xmath12 ( component number of our ensemble ) in the chain along axis @xmath88 . in the following the lower value of @xmath12",
    "will be estimated .",
    "the electron - nuclear spin hamiltonian for a donor atom @xmath0 has the form @xmath89 four energy levels of which are given by the well - known breit - rabi formula .",
    "for @xmath4 , @xmath90 ( the @xmath91axis is parallel to @xmath92 this formula is written as @xmath93 where constant of hyperfine interaction @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , if @xmath98 or @xmath99 , if @xmath100 ( here @xmath101 and @xmath102 are @xmath91projections of electron and nuclear spins accordingly ) .",
    "the energy level scheme is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for the energy of the ground spin state , @xmath100 and @xmath99 ,",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath103 for the next , excited energy state , @xmath98 , @xmath104 we have @xmath105 thus , the energy difference between the two lower states of the nuclear spin ( the resonant qubit frequency ) , that interacts with an electron , whose state remains unchanged , is described in simple terms @xmath106 for @xmath107 : @xmath108 for @xmath0 donor atoms @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 . in magnetic field",

    "the transitions with frequencies @xmath115 in the first approximation are _",
    "the states @xmath120 in @xmath121 basis are @xmath122 the diagonal matrix elements of nuclear magnetization @xmath123 per one donor atom for two lower energy states will be determined by @xmath124 the probabilities of the @xmath125qubit lowest and highest energy fully filling states for the same electron spin state @xmath126 , which correspond , as noted above , to the maximum probability of the nuclear polarization in pseudo - pure state , are : @xmath127 the possible maximum nuclear magnetization @xmath35 ( the populations of states @xmath128 and @xmath129 is negligible for @xmath130 is @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 we obtain ( compare with ( [ 3 ] ) ) @xmath134 but for very low temperatures ( @xmath135 ) we have the _ full nuclear polarization _ @xmath136 and @xmath44 .",
    "transitions between two lower states are induced by a rf magnetic field , applied at a frequency resonant @xmath137 .",
    "the rabi resonance frequency @xmath138 , which is defined by matrix elements of spin interaction hamiltonian with the external rf field @xmath7 @xmath139can be found from @xmath140 for the amplitude of effective rf field , acting on nuclear spin , @xmath141 we obtain @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the amplitude of circularly polarized field component .",
    "the rabi frequency has the maximum value for @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and monotonically reduces to value for the insulated nuclear spin ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath147 . from the rate of quantum operation standpoint it is desirable to operate in relatively weak fields @xcite , at which @xmath148 or @xmath149 .    in this case from ( [ 23 ] ) we will obtain @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the _ gain factor_. under these conditions rf field operates through the transverse component of electronic polarization . for magnetic fields",
    "@xmath112 we have the value @xmath152 , and for @xmath153 we have the value @xmath154 .",
    "the gain effect involves an increase of nmr signal and rabi frequency .",
    "this effect was indicated previously by k. valiev in @xcite .    in the pulse technique",
    "this effect makes it possible _ to decrease the length of pulse _ and along with it the times of logic operation performing .",
    "moreover , the computer operations , owing to this effect , can be performed at lower rf fields . at last",
    ", it permits to _ reduce the rf field influence _ on the operation of neighboring semiconductor devices .    to describe the nuclear dynamics for the two low - lying level systems being discussed ( @xmath133 ) , we can write the following bloch - type equation with only two effective relaxation times : @xmath155 - \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{x}}\\mathbf{i}\\mathbf+ m_{\\mathrm{y}}\\mathbf{j}}{t_{\\perp \\mathrm{i } } } - \\frac{(m_{\\mathrm{z } } - m_{\\mathrm{zm}})\\mathbf{k}}{t_{\\parallel\\mathrm{i } } } , \\label{25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath156 , @xmath11 are orthogonal unit vectors ( fig .  1 ) , @xmath35 is defined as ( [ 19 ] ) , @xmath157 it follows from it that the value of maximum nuclear read - out magnetization in nmr signal has here for @xmath158 , that is again for @xmath159 .",
    "hence , the read - out _ nmr signal can not be increased _ through the gain effect over its maximum value , that corresponds to @xmath160 .",
    "for the realization of an ensemble silicon quantum register we propose a variant of planar scheme @xcite , that , as an example , contains @xmath161 in parallel acting identical blocks , each has @xmath162 in parallel connected @xmath125qubit kane s linear ` molecules ' .",
    "this scheme is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "let the sample be the silicon ( @xmath72 ) plate of thickness 0.1 cm .",
    "for the full number of computers-`molecules ' in ensemble @xmath163 , the volume of sample and also of solenoid is @xmath164 ( the filling factor is assumed for simplicity to be one ) .",

    "the broad and narrow lines denote the @xmath74 and @xmath75 gates .",
    "the read - out signal from such _ ensemble in parallel acting _ chains , as distinct from liquid prototype , for full nuclear polarization or , what is the same , for nuclear spin temperatures @xmath166 has instead of the small factor in intensity of the nmr signal of type @xmath167 the factor @xmath44 .",
    "the nmr signal from our sample within a non - essential factor is the same as from macroscopic sample ( see appendix @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , with the expressions ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) and @xmath171 we will obtain as an estimation for maximum signal to noise ratio @xmath172 it is believed that for low temperatures @xmath173 . the effective volume of one ` molecule ' for @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 we receive that the read - out signal in our scheme may be _",

    "3 ) .    consequently , by the use of standard nmr and additional of endor techniques _ the first main difficulty _ of kane s scheme can be overcome .",
    "the electron and nuclear _ longitudinal relaxation times _ for the _ allowed _ transitions in four energy level system of phosphorus doped silicon have been extensively investigated experimentally in @xcite . for the allowed transitions with frequency @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( fig .",

    "the _ extremely long relaxation times _ of the electron and nuclear spins imply that the required initializing of nuclear quantum states ( full nuclear _ nonequilibrium polarizations _ ) can be attained by deep cooling of short duration of _ only nuclear spin system _ to @xmath197 without deep cooling of the lattice .",
    "there is the possibility to reach it at the _ indirect cooling _ of nuclear spin system by means of _ dynamic nuclear spin polarization techniques_@xcite .",
    "one such method of dynamic nuclear spin polarization for donor atoms is based on the saturation by _ the microwave pumping of the forbidden transition _ ( frequency @xmath115 in fig .",
