    "the lowest detectable surface brightnesses of galaxies are , in practical terms , a function of survey depth @xcite . low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are known to exist at all sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and across all environments , from the field @xcite to the local group @xcite to massive clusters such as virgo and coma @xcite . when compared to high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) of either similar luminosity or effective radius , the integrated number density of lsbgs surpasses that of hsbgs @xcite",
    ". and , as advances in instrumentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and methodology allow observations to push down to ever lower surface brightness limits , the diversity of the low surface brightness universe is continuously unveiled .",
    "recently , a population of ultra diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) featuring extremely low central surface brightnesses ( @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) and large effective radii ( @xmath8 kpc ) was identified in the outskirts of the coma cluster by @xcite ; and subsequent searches in the virgo @xcite and fornax @xcite clusters revealed similar ( though less numerous ) populations .",
    "@xcite measured the stellar velocity dispersion of dragonfly 44 ( coma - df44,hereafter df44 ) , one of the largest udgs in the coma cluster , and showed that the dark matter fraction within the effective radius is @xmath9% .",
    "similarly , globular cluster counts in two other udgs @xmath10 dragonfly 17 ( coma - df17 , hereafter df17 ) in coma @xcite and vcc 1287 in virgo @xcite @xmath10 indicate that these are systems with unusually high total mass - to - light ( or total - to - stellar mass ) ratios for their masses . while it seems clear that all three of these galaxies are underluminous for their total mass ( or globular cluster count ) , udgs do _ not _ all have the same mass .",
    "df44 is likely hosted by a massive ( @xmath11 ) dark matter halo , whereas the other two udg host halos are less massive , with reported estimates between @xmath12 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is not yet understood how udgs form , but considering that udgs are empirically defined solely on the basis of their size and surface brightness , it is reasonable to expect that multiple formation mechanisms may be at play .",
    "the udgs vcc 1287 , dragonfly 44 , and dragonfly 17 seem to be `` failed '' galaxies that are underluminous for their mass @xcite .",
    "there could plausibly be additional , fundamentally different systems that fall into the udg category as well .",
    "@xcite suggest , for example , that dwarf galaxies residing in dark matter halos with high spin have large sizes ( and thus low surface brightnesses ) and would therefore be observationally classified as udgs .",
    "any such objects are likely distinct from df44 , df17 and vcc 1287 , however , as all three of these galaxies are large and underluminous relative to their globular cluster systems .",
    "finally , some udgs could also be normal dwarfs disrupting in harsh cluster environments @xcite , analogous to disrupting dsphs in the local group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to mass measurements , understanding udgs and their properties as a function of environment is key to determining how and where udgs form . this is a nontrivial task , however , as the low surface brightness nature of udgs means that obtaining reliable distance measurements ranges from difficult to nearly impossible . @xcite",
    "obtained spectroscopic redshifts of seven field lsbgs , two of which are large enough and faint enough to qualify as udgs .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite measured the distances to relatively nearby ( and likely disrupting ) udgs associated with the spiral galaxy ngc 253 and the massive elliptical ngc 5128 ( cen a ) , respectively , via the tip of the red giant branch method .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite were able to spectroscopically confirm the presence of udgs in low density regions .    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence for the existence of udgs in a group environment .",
    "we use @xmath3 observations to constrain the distances to seven previously identified lsbgs @xcite , and find that four of the seven must lie at distances @xmath13 mpc .",
    "the lower limits on distance translate into minimum sizes , and we classify these galaxies as udgs .",
    "we assess the likely environment of the sample and discuss the implications of a population of group udgs .",
    "the diffuse galaxies examined in this work were originally discovered in data taken by the dragonfly telephoto array @xcite , in a field centered on the nearby spiral galaxy m101 ( @xcite ; we note that the galaxies are also visible in images taken on @xmath14 m amateur telescopes by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "dragonfly is a robotic , refracting telescope designed specifically for the detection of extended , extremely low surface brightness optical emission .",
    "the raw data frames were taken in the spring of 2013 , for a total of @xmath15 hours .",
    "full details of data collection and the data reduction pipeline are given in @xcite and @xcite . in brief",
    ", we obtain calibration frames each night and apply these to the individual frames . we model and correct for a sky gradient produced by changes in the sky background with zenith distance with a second order polynomial after aggressively masking all objects in the frame .    the final reduced images are constructed from @xmath16-band and @xmath17-band frames , and have a limiting surface brightness of @xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath2 and @xmath19 mag arcsec@xmath2 when measured in @xmath20 boxes .",
    "star - subtracted images were also required for a robust detection of low surface brightness galaxies @xcite ; these were produced using a custom pipeline that builds and applies an empirical , spatially varying composite psf ( described in detail in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the optical colors , luminosities , and morphologies of the seven lsbgs are consistent with being satellite galaxies associated with m101 itself ; and , as described in @xcite , none possess the large - scale wispy structure characteristic of galactic cirrus ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can not derive their distances from dragonfly photometry alone , however .",
    "we therefore obtained follow - up data with @xmath3 , as the higher spatial resolution ( @xmath21 arcsec pixel@xmath22 ) should provide photometry of resolved stars in each of these galaxies if they are in fact members of the m101 group ( at a distance modulus of @xmath23 , or @xmath24 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath3 data were obtained through the @xmath3 program 13682 and consist of acs / wfc imaging .",
    "each galaxy was observed for @xmath25 orbits with both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 filters .",
    "the data were reduced with the default @xmath3 reduction pipeline , and the drizzled @xmath3 images ( generated with ` astrodrizzle ` from the indivual calibrated images ) for the seven galaxies are shown in figure [ hstfig ] .",
    "we find a remarkable , qualitative difference between the galaxies .",
    "three are resolved into hundreds of stars , as expected for a distance of @xmath28 mpc .",
    "these three galaxies ( df1 , df2 , and df3 in the @xcite nomenclature ) are described in a companion paper ( danieli et al .",
    "2016 , submitted )",
    ". however , the remaining four ( df4 , df5 , df6 and df7 ) are , at first inspection , _ undetected _ in our @xmath3 imaging .",
    "the differences between the resolved and unresolved galaxies is illustrated in figure [ ptsourcefig ] .",
    "we select df3 and df4 as example galaxies , as they have nearly identical central surface brightness and size ( table [ paramstable ] ) . despite this ,",
    "when we examine the images at full @xmath3 resolution and the associated distributions of point sources detected with dolphot ( from danieli et al . )",
    ", df3 emerges as a clear overdensity while df4 appears to be an empty image .",
    "these two galaxies are representative of the differences between the two subsets of galaxies . only after binning and smoothing",
    "can we infer the presence of large , diffuse objects in the images of df4-df7 @xmath10 although df5-df7 are better visually described as large scale background variations than obvious objects ( see figure [ hstfig ] ) .",
    "figure [ cutoutsdf ] displays greyscale images of all four unresolved galaxies ( as observed with dragonfly ) ; color images of the central @xmath29 arcsec of each field , created from @xmath3 @xmath26 and @xmath27 data , are shown in figure [ cutoutshst ] .",
    "the fact that these four galaxies do not resolve into stars raises the question of whether our detection algorithm picked up noise peaks or artifacts in the dragonfly data .",
    "this is particularly a concern for df6 and df7 , which are not significantly detected with @xmath3 even after binning and smoothing .",
    "fortunately , the m101 field has excellent additional datasets which settle this question .",
    "the field has deep , public cfht imaging obtained in the context of the canada - france - hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtls * ? ? ?",
    "we obtained the reduced data from the cfht archive ; the data were processed first with the standard ` elixir ` @xcite software and then with the ` theli ` data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "the exposure times were 2500 s per filter .",
    "the cfht images of the four galaxies are shown in figure [ cutoutscfht ] .",
    "all four objects are clearly detected , and a comparison between figures [ cutoutsdf ] and [ cutoutscfht ] shows that their morphologies are consistent between the two datasets .",
    "figure [ datafig ] demonstrates that the apparent sizes of the galaxies are somewhat dependent on the dataset , however .",
    "in particular , df5 is the largest of the dragonfly - detected sample , but the smallest of the cfhtls - detected sample .",
    "the low spatial resolution of dragonfly could , in principle , result in an overestimated size if unresolved background structures are erroneously included in the light of the galaxy in question .",
    "dragonfly is optimized to detect spatially - extended emission , however , so another possibility is that the cfhtls data is less sensitive to the extremely diffuse outskirts of the galaxies .    as a test",
    ", we bin the cfht data to match the spatial resolution of dragonfly ( approximately @xmath30 pixels ) and then median - smooth with a kernel of @xmath31 pixels to enhance the low surface brightness outskirts ( figure [ binnedfig ] ) .",
    "the dragonfly data were also median - smoothed for consistency .",
    "after binning and smoothing , df5 is still smaller in the cfht image than in the dragonfly image .",
    "however , we can see that this process has indeed increased the flux at large radii , indicating that the most likely culprit is either the surface brightness limits of the cfht data or possibly an overestimate of the background level during sky subtraction .",
    "we therefore adopt the values of surface brightness , structure and sizes measured in the dragonfly data for the remainder of this paper .    ]",

    "thus far , the growing observational census for the udg population suggests that udgs are preferentially associated with massive early - type galaxies , with the presence of cluster udgs in particular becoming increasingly well documented @xcite .",
    "additional evidence in support of this picture comes from @xcite , who found that the non - nucleated lsbg population in fornax has a projected spatial distribution that clusters around the locations of giant ellipticals ( we note however , that their sample contains very few udgs ) ; from @xcite , who showed that the number density of udgs in clusters is correlated with cluster halo mass ; and from @xcite who reported that udgs tend to be located within large - scale structures",
    ".    examples of udgs with either established @xcite or implied @xcite lower density environments do exist , however . and ,",
    "recently , they have even been associated with spiral galaxies @xmath10 specifically in the cases of and xix in the local group @xcite and scl - mm - dw2 in the ngc 253 group @xcite .    to quantify the population of udgs in group environments , we compare the number of known udgs to the number of bright ( @xmath59 ) group members .",

    "although it is unclear based on this small sample whether we should necessarily expect a tight correlation between the number of bright members and the number of udgs in a given environment , these numbers do suggest that there should be at least one observable udg per nearby group .",
    "key questions regarding the udg population include : is this a stable population , or are we witnessing their disruption and the subsequent buildup of intragroup and intracluster light ? if they are stable , how can such diffuse galaxies survive ?",
    "the three cluster udgs @xmath10 df44 , df17 and vcc 1287 @xmath10 that have been studied in detail thus far have all been shown to have very high mass - to - light ratios in their central regions @xcite .",
    "all three have globular cluster systems ( and , in the case of df44 , a stellar velocity dispersion ) that are typical of galaxies in relatively massive dark matter halos , and a stellar component that is significantly underluminous . in combination with their ( undisturbed ) spheroidal morphologies and old stellar populations , these galaxies",
    "can potentially be thought of as `` failed '' @xmath64 or dwarf galaxies that lost their gas early on ( e.g. , by ram pressure stripping , * ? ? ?",
    "an alternate explanation is that some udgs are either the descendants of classical ( bulgeless ) lsbgs , which are thought to reside in massive , low density dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or , possibly , `` almost - darks '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that fell into denser environments . in this scenario , the colors and morphologies of the otherwise slowly - evolving lsbgs @xcite could be explained by an accelerated evolution induced by interactions with neighbors in high density environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that although the most diffuse and extended lsbgs are fated to disrupt in cluster environments ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , others will simply lose the majority of their halo mass ( and up to @xmath65% of their stellar mass ) and transform into spheroidal systems with low central surface densities and large effective radii .",
    "this particular scenario is ruled out for df44 , df17 and vcc 1287 , as lsbgs have been shown to contain `` normal '' globular cluster populations when compared to hsbgs at similar luminosity @xcite and if the galaxy had lost ( and redistributed ) enough mass to transform into a spheroidal udg , it should have also lost a substantial fraction of its globular clusters .",
    "it could , however , potentially explain udgs with depleted globular cluster systems .",
    "it is worth noting that the local group analog of the group and cluster udgs is and xix @xcite , a dwarf satellite of m31 that is known to be disrupting @xcite .",
    "the udgs recently identified around cen a and ngc 253 by @xcite and @xcite show evidence for disruption as well , in the form of extended , prominent tidal tails and an elongation towards the the central massive galaxy , respectively .",
    "@xcite also reported that one of the three udgs that they identified in the virgo cluster ( vlsb - a ) is disrupting , as indicated by its elongated structure . additionally , the apparent absence of udgs in the central regions of the coma cluster @xcite could be straightforwardly explained if udgs were unable to survive at small cluster - centric distances ; and @xcite find that the radial number density distribution of udgs in eight clusters is consistent with a lack of udgs within @xmath66 kpc of the cluster centers .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that ngc 5485 itself is enveloped by several tidal features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the four group udgs presented here are unstable and tidally disrupting , then we should expect to see this reflected in their morphologies . as discussed in section [ morph ] ,",
    "df4 is highly distorted , with a boomerang - like appearance . df6 and df7 are elongated , although not obviously pointed towards the group center ( this is not ruled out , however , considering projection effects ) .",
    "this would appear to be at odds with the round morphologies and apparently regular appearance of cluster udgs ( the average axis ratio for the coma sample is @xmath67 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed analysis morphologies of cluster udgs is beyond the scope of this work , but we are investigating this in a separate paper ( mowla et al . , in preparation ) .    in figure [ udgprops ]",
    ", we show the size , axis ratio , and central surface brightness of every known udg reported here as well as in the literature .",
    "unlike figure [ theplot ] , this time we show _ only _ those udgs with measured distances ( or upper limits ) ; that is , if the discovery paper assumed a distance or association with a background object , we do not include those data points .",
    "the udgs in this work and in the literature are represented by stars and circles , respectively , and symbols with black borders highlight the udgs that have been reported to be disrupting .",
    "we note that there is an apparent clustering of the disrupting udgs seen in the lower left panel ( in the axis ratio @xmath10 surface brightness plane ) , such that they tend to inhabit the lowest surface brightness regime ( @xmath68 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) and , while they cover a wide range in axis ratios , the majority have @xmath69 .",
    "intruigingly , the roundest udg in our small sample @xmath10 df5 @xmath10 also has the largest projected distance from the group center ( see figures [ fovcolor ] and [ grouppos ] ) . if df5 is _ not _ associated with the ngc 5485 group , it could be an example of an isolated udg .",
    "the identification of a population of field udgs would provide critical clues to their formation .",
    "regardless of whether udgs are stable or on the brink of disruption , the fact that we observe these galaxies residing in groups suggests that group pre - processing may play a significant role in their formation and subsequent arrival in clusters @xcite ; in this case we expect that future searches of nearby groups will turn up comparable populations of udgs .",
    "we have presented follow - up @xmath3/acs observations of four lsbgs discovered in @xcite ; the other three resolved galaxies are presented in danieli et al .",
    "( 2016 , submitted ) .",
    "we placed lower distance limits of @xmath46 mpc based on the lack of resolved stars in the @xmath3 imaging . given that the distance to the udgs rules out the possibility of a m101 group membership",
    ", we consider that they are instead part of the background ngc 5473 / 5485 group , located at @xmath5 mpc .",
    "the projected positions of the udgs are distributed evenly around the center of the group , consistent with this picture . at this distance ,",
    "the galaxies have effective radii of @xmath6 kpc , and the large physical sizes combined with the low central surface brightnesses ( @xmath70 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) qualifies them as udgs .    moving forward",
    ", it will be critical to expand the census of known udgs even further , particular to lower density environments .",
    "the identification of group udgs is perhaps not surprising given their apparent ubiquity in clusters , although finding four in a single group is remarkable given that there are only three ( with measured distances ) known in the virgo cluster thus far .",
    "the morphologies of the group udgs are , on average , more complex than the morphologies of cluster udgs . if a significant fraction of the udg population is comprised of puffed - up dwarfs , then it is possible that we are witnessing that transformation happening .",
