    "likewise , an understanding of the atoms and molecules does not require knowledge of quarks or even of nuclear physics , for that matter .",
    "the reductionist s hope is that _ the principles _ governing all phenomena stem from a fundamental underlying theory which , in turn , would enable us to derive seemingly fundamental concepts from a deeper origin .",
    "the derivation of the empirical laws governing the behaviour of ideal gases from kinetic theory provides a simple illustration of this .",
    "a different example is the derivation of the stefan - boltzmnn law for the emissive power of a blackbody ( which also enables us to write stefan s constant in terms of the more fundamental planck s constant ) .",

    "continuing in this vein , we may hope that in the future , some of the many disparate parameters of the standard model which has been remarkably successful in describing data up to distance scales down to ( 100  gev)@xmath4 , will be derived from an underlying ( more ) fundamental theory that includes a detailed description of new degrees of freedom with mass scales ( much ) higher than 100  gev .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that realizing such a top - down program may prove very difficult , even in principle , because the low energy theory may turn out to be sensitive to physics at all energy scales .",
    "although most of us implicitly assume that very high energy scale degrees of freedom decouple from low energy physics , it remains logically possible that this may not be the case .",
    "it could , for instance , be that the multiplicity of massive states grows so rapidly with mass , that even though the effect of any individual state is negligible , their collective effect remains at low energy . in this case",
    ", one would have to know the detailed physics at all energy scales to realize the top - down program .",
    "the other possibility is that low energy physics is insensitive to the details of high scale physics because the effects of the latter are suppressed by a power of the high scale @xmath5 .",
    "this view provides a rationale for the success that renormalizable relativisitic quantum field theories have enjoyed in the describing strong and electro - weak phenomena today , and makes a strong case that any mass scale associated with unknown degrees of freedom lies well above the highest energies accessible today , so that the effect of non - renormalizable operators is sufficiently suppressed .",
    "there is , however , an associated issue , brought to the forefront by the discovery of the first ( seemingly ) elementary spin - zero particle at the cern collider with attributes remarkably consistent with those of the higgs boson of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "although , as we just said , low energy phenomena are essentially independent of @xmath5 , the _ dimensionful _ parameters of the _ renormalized _ theory are generally speaking sensitive to the high scale @xmath5 , and hence to the physics at high energy scales .",
    "for instance , in a generic quantum field theory , the radiative corrections to the squared mass of an elementary spin - zero particle take the form , m_^2 - m_0 ^ 2 = c_1 ^2 + c_2 m_low^2 ( ) + c_3 m_low^2 .",

    "fine - tuning in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is seemingly exacerbated because experiments at the lhc have discovered a sm - like higgs boson with a mass at 125 - 126  gev , well beyond its tree - level upper bound @xmath36 .",
    "radiative corrections can readily accommodate this , but only with top squark masses beyond the tev scale along with large mixing@xcite .",

    ", we adopt the nuhm2 model cases from table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite that resulted in low values of @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , we have have : @xmath94 @xmath95    table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that a change of @xmath961% in the gut scale values of @xmath64 caused @xmath3 to alter by @xmath97% .",
    "this had led us to suggest that if there was an underlying meta - theory in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 were tightly correlated instead of being independent parameters as in the nuhm2 model , this underlying theory might not be fine - tuned .",
    "in the nuhm2 model , case a yields @xmath98 and @xmath99 , while for case b we have @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we immediately see that since @xmath3 is two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath70 , in order to check whether the correlations indeed reduce @xmath70 to ( near ) @xmath3 , the former would need to be computed to better than the percent level .",
    "this precludes the use of semi - analytic 1-loop expressions ( [ eq : mhu ] ) that ignore two loop effects and also evaluate the coefficients for a fixed value of @xmath75 for the computation of @xmath70 . using ( [ eq : mhu ] ) ( as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite ) will be reliable .",
    "only when the cancellation between the various terms approach the percent level will this procedure become suspect .",
    "] we clearly need a different procedure to evaluate @xmath70 in the meta - theory in which various nuhm2 parameters are correlated ; _",
    "i.e. _ , the meta - theory has fewer independent parameters than contained in the nuhm2 parameter set .",
    "we use the following multi - step procedure based on isajet@xcite for a reliable evaluation of @xmath70 :    1 .",
    "since the sensitivity coefficients needed for the evaluation of @xmath70 depend on gut - scale parameters , for the nuhm2 point of interest ( for which isajet uses the weak scale values of @xmath54 and @xmath83 as inputs ) , we first evaluate @xmath102 and @xmath103 using two - loop renormalization group evolution instead of the one - loop semi - analytic formulae mentioned above",
    "we have created a program that uses these gut - scale values of higgs parameters together with other gut - scale susy parameters to iteratively evaluate the susy spectrum .",
    "for this code , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are outputs that ( nearly ) coincide with the input value of @xmath104 and the observed value of @xmath105 .",
    "we use the gut - scale values of gauge and yukawa couplings from the last iteration for this calculation .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are also re - evaluated .",
    "3 .   to evaluate the sensitivity coefficients that enter the computation of @xmath70",
    ", we now incrementally change each of the _ independent _ gut - scale input parameters one - by - one ( keeping all other parameters fixed ) and reevaluate @xmath38 .",
    "the sensitivity coefficient is then obtained using @xmath106 .",
    "the largest of the sensitivity coefficients is taken as @xmath70 . within the nuhm2 model ,",
    "the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 are all independent , and so each one of these has a sensitivity coefficient that enters the evaluation of @xmath70 . as noted",
    ", this gives @xmath109 and @xmath100 for cases a and b , respectively . the situation is quite different if the nuhm2 arises from a meta - theory in which the parameters are correlated as described below .",
    "4 .   next , motivated by our earlier studies , we imagine that the nuhm2 is derived from a meta - model in which @xmath80 is not an independent parameter but is fixed in terms of @xmath79 by @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .",
    "this correlation reduces @xmath112 contributions to @xmath41 and simultaneously raises @xmath113 to its observed value  @xcite . in the meta - model , the sensitivity coefficient corresponding to @xmath80",
    "should not be included during the evaluation of @xmath70 because @xmath80 is not an independent parameter .",
    "for the two cases that we examined ( and likely over much of parameter space ) , the value of @xmath70 was fixed by sensitivity coefficients other than @xmath114 , and so remains unchanged from its value in the nuhm2 model .",
    "recalling that the adjustment of the gut - scale value of @xmath64 was key to obtaining a low value of @xmath3 in the nuhm2 framework @xcite , we assume that , like @xmath80 , @xmath115 is also not an independent parameter in the meta - theory . since the sensitivity to @xmath102 was dominant in the nuhm2 model , viewing this as a dependent parameter can dramatically reduce @xmath70 . taking @xmath116 with @xmath117 ( 1.70 ) in case a ( case b ) reduces @xmath70 by about an order of magnitude . 6 .   finally , if we assume that the gaugino masses are also not independent but given by @xmath118 with @xmath119 ( 0.25 ) in case a ( case b ) , @xmath70 drops by another order of magnitude .",
    "we emphasize that the spectrum and , in fact , all phenomenological predictions of this meta - theory will be identical to those of the nuhm2 model with the same parameters .",
    "the impact of these correlations between the parameters of the meta - theory on @xmath70 is illustrated in table  [ tab : correl ] .",
    ".values of @xmath70 for the two cases of the nuhm2 model introduced in the text .",
    "the first row shows the value of @xmath70 without any correlations ; in the second row we take @xmath80 and @xmath102 to be determined by @xmath79 with @xmath120 for case a , and 1.70 for case b , with @xmath121 for both cases . in the third row",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath74 is also determined by @xmath79 with @xmath122 ( 0.25 ) for case a ( case b ) .",
    "the last row shows the value of @xmath3 .",
    "[ tab : correl ] [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that for an integrated luminosity in excess of @xmath123  fb@xmath4 the greatest reach will be obtained via the ssdb channel if we assume gaugino mass unification .",
    "more importantly , the ssdb channel provides a novel way to search for a susy signal in _ any natural model of supersymmetry _ since , as we have emphasized , the @xmath54 parameter needs to be small . in this case , there may be striking confirmatory signals in the @xmath124 and soft - trilepton channels in addition to the much - discussed clean trilepton signal from wino pair production .      because light higgsinos are @xmath125 doublets , they necessarily have sizeable couplings to the @xmath126 boson , and so should be copiously produced in @xmath127 colliders , unless their production is kinematically suppressed . since small",
    "@xmath104 is necessary for naturalness , electron - positron linear colliders that are being envisioned for construction are the obvious facility for definitive searches for natural susy .",
    "the issue , of course , is whether in light of the small visible energy release in higgsino decays it is possible to pull out the higgsino signal above sm backgrounds .    here , we report preliminary results from an on - going study @xcite of higgsino signals at an electron - positron linear collider with a centre - of - mass energy of 250  gev ( ilc250 ) that is seriously being considered for construction in japan . for this study ,",
    "we have chosen the nuhm2 point with @xmath128  gev , @xmath129  gev , @xmath130  gev with @xmath131 .",
    "this case has gluinos and squarks beyond the current lhc reach ( though it should be possible to find gluino and even wino signals at lhc14 ) , and has @xmath132  gev , @xmath133  gev and @xmath134  gev , with @xmath135 .",
    "we view this point ( ilc1 ) as an `` easy case study '' because of the rather large mass gap .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath136 production processes typically have visible energies near 250  gev , except when neutrino daughters from the decay of produced parents take away a large energy .",
    "in contrast , the signal has a visible energy smaller than 50  gev . except for a small contribution from the tail of the @xmath137 production ,",
    "the @xmath136 backgounds are efficiently removed by a cut on @xmath138 .",
    "much more relevant are backgrounds from `` two - photon '' processes , @xmath139 where the final state electrons and positrons carry off the bulk of the energy and are lost down the beam - pipe . however , except when @xmath140 these events are back - to - back in the transverse plane and have very low @xmath141 . after the additional cut @xmath142  gev , the signal from @xmath143 production is readily visible in the @xmath144 channel with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath4 , where jets and leptons are defined to have transverse energies bigger than 5  gev .",
    "beam polarization is not necessary for this .",
    "the signal from neutralino production or @xmath145 has a much smaller cross section as the coupling of the higgsinos to @xmath126 is dynamically suppressed @xcite . ] via @xmath146 is also detectable with additional cuts @xmath147  gev , @xmath148 , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . for this study ,",
    "90% electron beam polarization is required .",
    "notice that despite the small leptonic branching ratio for @xmath149 decay , the signal is best seen via the leptonic decay of @xmath149 .",
    "this is because hadronic decays of @xmath149 lead mostly to single jet event topologies .    ref .",
    "@xcite also examines a more challenging case , for a point along the model - line ( [ eq : mline ] ) with @xmath150  tev .",
    "this yields @xmath151  gev , and a mass gap with the neutralino of just @xmath152  gev .",
    "this point is chosen because it has @xmath153 , close to what we consider the maximum for naturalness , and a mass gap that is near the minimum , consistent with naturalness considerations . for this case ,",
    "gluinos and all squarks ( and likely also winos ) are beyond the lhc14 reach .    for the heavier @xmath154 and @xmath149 mass for this case ,",
    "we have performed a study taking @xmath155  gev , just below the @xmath156 threshold .",
    "if the ilc is constructed , and its energy upgraded to study the top quark threshold , we expect that there will surely be an ilc run close to this energy .",
    "the smaller mass gap leads to events with even less visible energy than in the ilc1 case study just discussed . in this case , requiring @xmath157  gev along with cuts on @xmath141 and various jet and lepton angles in the transverse plane suffices to make the background negligible , and render the signal observable at the @xmath158 level @xcite . indeed , since there may well be no visible signal at lhc14 in this difficult scenario , the ilc could well be a discovery machine for susy !    although we have not performed a parameter space scan , the fact that the signal can be extracted even in this nearly maximally difficult rns case strongly suggests that higgsino signal will be observable at an @xmath127 collider provided of course that the higgsinos are kinematically accessible and that electron beam polarization is available ( for the neutralino signal ) .",
    "in fact , we are curently investigating the prospects for mass measurements .",
    "since the lsp is likely higgsino - like in _ all _ models with natural supersymmetry , it will annihilate rapidly ( via its large coupling to the @xmath126 boson , and also via @xmath159-channel higgsino exchange processes ) in the early universe . as a result , in natural supersymmetry",
    "the measured cold dark matter density can not arise solely from _ thermally produced higgsinos _",
    "( remember that these are lighter than @xmath160  gev ) in standard big bang cosmology .",
    "dark matter is thus likely to be multi - component .",
    "what is very interesting , however , is that because naturalness considerations also impose and upper bound on @xmath161 and corresponding limits on electroweak gaugino masses ( via gaugino mass unification ) , _ the thermal higgsino relic density can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "_ indeed , within the rns framework , @xmath162 must be between @xmath163 , as shown by baer , barger and mickleson @xcite .",
    "this has important implications for dm detection experiments .",
    "specifically , ton - size direct detection experiments such as xe-1ton that probe the spin - independent nucleon lsp cross section at the @xmath164  pb level will be sensitive to entire range of the expected higgsino fraction .",
    "thus , the outcome of these experiments will have important ramifications for naturalness .",
    "naturalness is a measure of how sensitive low energy masses and couplings are to the dynamics at hierarchically separated energy scales , and so is an attribute of the underlying high scale theory .",
    "the dynamics of the sm shows us that the higgs boson mass exhibits quadratic senstive to masses of new , heavy particles , if these couple to the higgs boson .",
    "this sensitivity is correspondingly reduced if these particles have very weak couplings to the higgs sector , or couple only indirectly at the multi - loop level . in theories that incorporate weak scale supersymmetry ,",
    "the quadratic sensitivity to the masses of particles at very high scales is reduced to logarithmic sensitivity . in all these considerations ,",
    "we agree with most discussions of naturalness and fine - tuning in much of the literature .    where we evidently differ from many authors is that we allow for the possibility that model parameters that appear independent from our low energy perspective may really correlated within the as yet undiscovered underlying theory .",
    "these correlations , as we have argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] , can easily change the fine - tuning measure by a couple of orders of magnitude : our toy illustrations show that a theory that appears to be fine - tuned at parts per ten thousand may actually be fine - tuned at the few percent level .",
    "ignoring these parameter correlations is what leads to stringent limits on top squarks that are usually advertized as the hallmark of natural supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed , the measures @xmath52 and @xmath70 defined in sec .  [ sec : measures ] both incorporate the sensitivity of @xmath38 to the physics of new particles at the high scale .",
    "however , the effect of parameter correlations is most simply encoded into @xmath70 , but is technically difficult to incorporate into @xmath52 , because the coefficients @xmath165 in ( [ eq : hsft ] ) can not easily be written in terms of the model parameters in a simple way .    whether or not a theory is ( or is not ) natural",
    "clearly depends on how very heavy particles couple to weak scale particles .",
    "this is a question of dynamics , and so can not be answered by just looking at the weak scale spectrum of the theory .",
    "for this reason , we can not regard @xmath0 ( which is essentially fixed by the spectrum ) introduced in ( [ eq : delew ] ) as a measure of fine - tuning in the theory , in sharp contrast to the considerations in ref .  @xcite . despite this , we agree with both ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that fine - tuning considerations using the weak scale theory is very useful , albeit for different reasons from these authors .",
    "we find that @xmath3 is extremely useful because it serves as a bound on @xmath70 , the true fine - tuning measure : see eq .",
    "( [ eq : inequal ] ) .",
    "any model that leads to a large value of @xmath3 is certainly fine - tuned .",
    "a small value of @xmath3 in some region of model parameter space does not guarantee the model is not fine - tuned .",
    "however , it leaves open the possibility that parameter correlations required to zero in on this special part of parameter space will , one day , be obtained from a more fundamental underlying framework .",
    "evaluation of @xmath70 with these parameter correlations incorporated , will then yield a value ( close to ) @xmath3",
    ". however , until such time that we have such a theory , it is useful to examine the low @xmath3 regions of the parameter space of phenomenologically promising models because these serve as surrogates for an underlying theory with low fine - tuning , as explained at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] .",
    "the rns framework which , by construction , has a low value of @xmath3 , provides an explicit realization of such a program .",
    "since many phenomenological results are sensitive to just the spectrum , these can be abstracted from the rns model .",
    "rns phenomenology is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phen ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pan ] , we show the @xmath166 plane of the nuhm2 model with large @xmath79 together with contours of @xmath3 .",

    "we show the region accessible to lhc8 gluino pair searches ( solid blue contour ) , and the region accessible to lhc14 searches with 300  fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity ( dashed and dot - dashed contours ) .",
    "we also show the reach of various ilc machines for higgsino pair production ( black contours ) .",
    "the very light - shaded ( green ) region has @xmath172 .",

    ", we note that @xmath173.,width=377 ]    above and to the right of the @xmath174 contour , we regard the spectrum to be fine - tuned since the fine - tuning _ must be _ worse than @xmath175% .",
    "the light - shaded ( green ) region is where the thermal higgsino relic density is smaller than its measured value , with the balance being made up by something else .",
    "the dashed line shows the lhc14 reach via the canonical search for gluinos , while the dot - dashed line shows our projection via searches in the novel ssdb channel discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : lhc ] .",
    "we see that lhc searches will , by themselves , not be able to cover the entire parameter space with @xmath176 .",
    "the remainder of this parameter space should be accessible , via a search for higgsinos at an @xmath127 collider operating at @xmath177  gev .    to sum up",
    ", we stress that the fact that low scale physics is only logarithmically ( and not quadratically ) sensitive to the scale of ultra - violet physics remains a very attractive feature of softly broken susy models .",
    "the fact that it is possible to find phenomenologically viable models with low @xmath3 leads us to speculate that our understanding of uv physics is incomplete , and that there might be hs models with the necessary parameter correlations that will lead to comparably low values of the true fine - tuning parameter @xmath70 .",
