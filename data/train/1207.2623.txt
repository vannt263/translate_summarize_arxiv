    "molecule - based magnets present an intriguing field of materials due to their combination of magnetism with various other physical phenomena .",
    "specifically , those materials which exhibit photomagnetic properties provide a vast potential for technological applications . in recent years , prussian blue analogues ( pbas )",
    "have piqued the interest of the molecular magnetism community due to their range of magnetic properties .",
    "although examples exist that are known to order magnetically at or above room temperature @xcite , the feature that distinguishes a particularly appealing subset of pbas is the phenomenon of a charge - transfer - induced spin transition ( ctist ) @xcite , which is linked with that of persistent photoinduced magnetism ( ppim ) @xcite . when these properties are combined with long - range magnetic order , the potential for information storage applications begins to emerge .",
    "a quintessential example of such a material is the cofe - pba , a@xmath9co[fe(cn)@xmath1@xmath10h@xmath3o , where a is a monovalent alkali cation .",
    "cofe - pbas are well - known to exhibit a photoinduced ctist up to a temperature of @xmath11  k @xcite , as well as a similar photoinduced transition within the hysteresis of the thermal ctist near , and even at , room temperature for certain stoichiometries @xcite .",
    "however , these photoinduced effects are weaker above @xmath12  k , which is the critical temperature , @xmath13 , for the long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "the fact that the photoeffect in the cofe - pba is also structural in nature has been utilized to effect an increase in the temperature at which photocontrol is possible , by incorporating this material into heterostructures @xcite with pbas having higher ordering temperatures and known to be pressure - sensitive @xcite . to guide work pursuing room temperature photocontrolled magnetism",
    ", we seek a deeper fundametntal understanding of the mechanism leading to these novel effects in the heterostructures , focusing here on quantifying the amount of material , in the non - photoactive layers , affected by this photoinduced strain from the cofe - pba .        in the present study ,",
    "core ( * b * ) and core - shell ( * ba * ) particles of pbas ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , composed of shells of k@xmath0ni[cr(cn)@xmath1@xmath2h@xmath3o ( * a * ) , which orders ferromagnetically with @xmath4  k , surrounding bulk cores of rb@xmath5co[fe(cn)@xmath1@xmath6h@xmath3o ( * b * ) , which is photoactive and orders ferrimagnetically with @xmath7  k , have been investigated .",
    "below @xmath4  k of the shell , these samples exhibit a persistent photoinduced decrease in low - field susceptibility , similar to those results from other core - shell particles @xcite and analogous * aba * heterostructured films @xcite .",
    "this net decrease is attributed to the photoinduced lattice expansion in the * b * layer , which generates a strain - induced decrease in the magnetization of the * a * layer , similar to a pressure - induced decrease observed by others in a pure * a*-like material , attributed to spin - canting @xcite . upon further examination",
    ", the core - shell susceptibility data also reveal a significant portion of the * a * material whose superexchange , @xmath8 , is perturbed with the application of this photoinduced strain from the * b * material .",
    "k@xmath14cr(cn)@xmath15 was synthesized by treating aqueous solutions of potassium cyanide with crcl@xmath16h@xmath3o and was used after recrystallization from methanol @xcite .",
    "deionized water used in synthetic procedures was obtained from a barnstead nanopure .",
    "all of the other reagents were purchased from sigma - aldrich or fisher - acros and were used without further purification .",

    "the synthesis of the core particles was performed at room temperature .",
    "an aqueous solution ( @xmath18  ml ) of cocl@xmath19h@xmath3o ( @xmath20  mmol , @xmath21  mm ) , and an equal volume of an aqueous solution containing k@xmath14fe(cn)@xmath15 ( @xmath22  mmol , @xmath23  mm ) were simultaneously added dropwise to @xmath24  ml of nanopure water . to substitute the rb cation , rbcl ( @xmath25  mmol , @xmath26  mm ) was included in the cocl@xmath3 solution .",
    "the final solution was kept under vigorous stirring for one hour after all additions were complete .",
    "the particles were subsequently filtered under vacuum using a @xmath17 m filter before being washed with ultrapure water and redispersed in @xmath18  ml of water for use in the next step . to isolate the particles , instead of water ,",
    "the particles were concentrated by centrifugation and dried under a flow of air .    to prepare the core - shell particles , the previously synthesized core particles solution was diluted with water to 400 ml . an aqueous solution ( @xmath27  ml ) of nicl@xmath19h@xmath3o ( @xmath28  mmol , @xmath29  mm ) and an aqueous solution ( @xmath27  ml ) of k@xmath14cr(cn)@xmath15 ( @xmath30  mmol , @xmath31  mm ) were added dropwise ( @xmath32  ml / hour , peristaltic pump ) under stirring at room temperature .",

    "energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) was performed with an oxford instruments eds x - ray microanalysis system coupled to the tem .",

    "powder samples were mixed with kbr and pressed into pellets under @xmath12  mpa .",
    "scans ( typically 64 ) were performed between @xmath41 and @xmath42  @xmath43 , in the region of the cn stretching bands , with a precision of @xmath44  @xmath43 .",
    "corresponding scans of a pure kbr pellet were taken as the background measurement .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed on a quantum design mpms xl-7 superconducting interference device ( squid ) magnetometer using a homemade fiber optic sample rod with a bundle of 10 optical fibers to bring light into the sample space @xcite .",
    "powder samples were spread between two pieces of transparent tape and held in transparent drinking straws directly below the optical fibers .",
    "visible white light was supplied by a @xmath11  w tungsten - halogen lamp located at room temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of the low - field susceptibility was measured in an applied field of @xmath18  g while warming the sample from base temperature , @xmath35  k. isothermal magnetization was measured at @xmath35  k while sweeping the field between @xmath45  kg and @xmath46  kg . all light state measurements were performed subsequent to 8 hours of isothermal irradiation at @xmath47  k , after irradiation had been ceased .",
    "the sample was then cooled again to base temperature , where the same protocol that was used for the dark state measurements was repeated to acquire the light state data set .    , of the * ba * sample near the transition temperature of the * a * constituent , where the shoulder between @xmath48  k and @xmath49",
    "k is indicative of the shift in @xmath13 due to the photoinduced strain .",
    "the bottom left inset shows the untreated susceptibility , @xmath50 , in the dark and light states .",
    "the top right inset shows @xmath51 over the entire range of temperatures.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the tem images reveal contrast between core and shell in the * ba * particles not present for the pure * b * particles ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "additionally , eds line scans of individual particles show co and fe content concentrated in the cores , with ni and cr content predominately occupying the edges @xcite . the ftir spectra display a new cn stretching frequency , near @xmath52  @xmath43 , arising after addition of the * a * shell , consistent with observations for the pure * a * material .",
    "powder xrd patterns also present two distinct lattice constants consistent with the single - phase * b * and * a * materials , respectively , while only the * b * phase is exhibited in the core particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the low - field susceptibility of the * ba * sample exhibits a persistent photoinduced decrease ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "although the * b * material is a well - established photomagnet @xcite , these heterostructures invert the sign of the effect in addition to increasing the temperature of photocontrol @xcite .",
    "this photoeffect possesses a significant magnitude up to @xmath53 k of the * a * material , attributed to a strain - induced canting of the * a * spins , similar to pressure - induced effects in a similar material @xcite .",
    "additionally , a subtle shoulder near the @xmath13 of the * a * material emerges in the photoinduced decrease , @xmath51 , indicating a shift in the superexchange of some portion of the shell . in order to quantify the amount of affected material , the derivative of the susceptibility was taken and normalized to the same area , in the range @xmath47  k to @xmath54  k , for each data set ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the validity of normalizing the light and dark data sets to equal areas is substantiated by the corresponding saturation magnetizations , which indicate no loss of spins upon irradiation .",
    "thus , taking the area under these curves to represent the total number of spins in the shell , this area must remain constant for a given sample between the dark and light states . upon inspection of these derivatives , an aspect of the effect not immediately obvious in the raw data ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] inset ) becomes apparent .",
    "namely , the magnetic transition of the * a * material sharpens significantly when the * b * material is transitioned to the light state . again",
    ", this observation indicates that a significant portion of the * a * material experiences a change in its superexchange .",
    ", in the dark and light states near the transition temperature of the * a * constituent .",
    "the inset shows @xmath55 over the entire range of temperatures.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    guided by these observations , we apply a simple model of the shell comprising two distinct regions : an inner , strain - sensitive interface region and an outer , rigid bulk - like region , which remains unaffected by switching between the dark and light states . taking these regions to represent distinct superexchange values , the areas under the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , representing the total number of spins in the shell constituent , must account for these two regions .",
    "fitting these curves with two peaks , corresponding to the two assumed superexchange values , provides a measure of the percentage of the shell in each region .",
    "the bulk - like value is taken to be the higher @xmath13 , which does not shift , and this value remains constant between the fits , while the total area is constrained to unity .",
    "these fits reveal 50% of the material with each @xmath13 , where the bulk - like material has @xmath56  k and the strained material has @xmath57  k shifting to @xmath58  k , which is closer to that attributed to the bulk .",
    "the direction of this shift may be explained phenomenologically in the following manner . upon cooling ,",
    "the * b * material undergoes a lattice contraction from a @xmath59    lattice constant to @xmath60   , thus stretching the * a * lattice near the interface . with irradiation ,",
    "the * b * lattice again expands to its room temperature size of @xmath59   , allowing the interfacial * a * lattice to relax closer to its bulk state .",
    "by analyzing the first derivative of the susceptibilities in the dark and light states of the * ba * particles , we have quantified the amount of the * a * material affected by the strain arising from the photinduced expansion of the * b * lattice . although the shift in superexchange is found to be small ( @xmath61 k ) , nearly _",
    "half _ of the volume of the * a * shell experiences this superexchange perturbation upon photoswitching the * b * core .",
    "a forthcoming report will detail the investigation of the same cores with increasing shell thicknesses .",
