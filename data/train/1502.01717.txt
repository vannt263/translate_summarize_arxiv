    "<S> details of this vibronic model and the corresponding feynman diagrams for the spectral components n11 and r31 are discussed in the supplementary note  2 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate how an excitonic system within a noisy environment can exhibit long - lasting coherent features : the observed long - lived oscillations are the result of coherent interaction of excitonic bands with an underdamped , quasi - resonant vibration . </S>",
    "<S> this vibronic mechanism requires the vibrational dissipation rate @xmath61 to be much slower than the electronic decoherence rate @xmath54 , which is the case for c8o3 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in electronic and vibrational decoherence rates can be rationalized from the fact that excitons and vibrations are related to the motion of electrons and nuclei , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lower mass of electrons as compared to nuclei makes excitons more mobile and therefore more sensitive to environmental fluctuations , such as local electric fields , than vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the vibronic mixing leading to long - lived beating signals in 2d - es is described by a vibronic coupling that induces coherent energy exchange between excitons and quasi - resonant vibrations ( see supplementary note  2 for further details ) : @xmath82 this implies that the vibronic coupling not only induces long - lasting electronic excited - state coherences , but also can mediate population transfer between excitonic bands . in a combination with thermal relaxation of exciton populations , </S>",
    "<S> the vibronic coupling may further enhance exciton population transfer and as a result could , in principle , have functional relevance in exciton transport@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the different decoherence rates @xmath83 of bands 1 and 3 lead to different amplitudes of the short - lived beating signals in n11 and r31 ( figs.3**b * * and * c * ) , which are determined by the prefactors @xmath60 and @xmath75 , respectively . the lower decoherence rate of band 1 can be explained by band 1 being localized on the inner layer , while band 3 is delocalized over both the inner and outer layers@xcite . as shown by the response functions for n11 and r31 , the overall strength of the beating signals is proportional to the inverse of the electronic decoherence rates . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore expected that the beating signal amplitude would diminish with an increase of the decoherence rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for n22 , where the physical situation in terms of exciton - vibrational resonance ( @xmath84 ) is equivalent to n11 ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial difference is that band 2 has a higher decoherence rate than band 1 , as band 2 is localized on the outer layer exposed to solvent@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the broader linewidth of band 2 in absorption and 2d spectra . </S>",
    "<S> using an estimated value of @xmath86 , the presented theory predicts the strength of n22 to be @xmath39 of n11 ( see supplementary note  2 ) , which is in line with the experimental observations ( fig.2**f * * ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the experimentally observed long - lived beating signals , induced by vibronic mixing , require adequately low electronic decoherence rates , highlighting that resonance between exciton energy splitting and vibrational frequency alone is not sufficient@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the presented vibronic model achieves quantitative agreement with the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the constraints imposed by the observed asymmetric decoherence rates @xmath83 and fast relaxation of exciton population in c8o3 on sub - picosecond timescales@xcite rule out incoherent models , where long - lived oscillations are sustained by markovian correlated fluctuations ( see supplementary note  3 for a detailed analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> this further supports our conclusion that the observed experimental data provide evidence for vibronic mixing being the mechanism at play in our system .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that our results do not imply that correlated fluctuations can be universally ruled out , as this mechanism could be in place in certain pigment - protein complexes . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of correlated fluctuations has been developed for photosynthetic complexes where pigments are embedded in a protein scaffold . </S>",
    "<S> the protein has been considered as the potential source of correlated fluctuations in natural light harvesters@xcite . for c8o3 , a structural frame such as a protein scaffold is absent and therefore correlated fluctuations are unlikely to induce long - lived oscillatory 2d - signals , which is in line with our observations .     </S>",

    "<S> the vibronic states @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the vibrational ground and first excited state of an electronic state @xmath89 , respectively , with the single index states @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 denoting the electronic ground state and bands 1 and 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton energy splitting @xmath93 between bands 1 and 3 is quasi - resonant with the vibrational frequency @xmath14 , where the detuning is denoted by @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton - vibrational coupling between uncoupled states @xmath44 and @xmath45 leads to vibronic eigenstates @xmath95 and @xmath96 , each of which is a superposition of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , leading to an energy - level shifting by @xmath62 . * </S>",

    "<S> we have verified , theoretically and experimentally , that coherent vibronic coupling in the electronic excited - state manifold is responsible for the long - lived beating signals observed in 2d spectra of an artificial light harvester . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively simple electronic and vibrational structure of the investigated molecular aggregate along with its macroscopic alignment allowed us to rule out the presence of correlated fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the specific geometry of our system allowed us to gain further insights by illustrating the conditions under which intra - pigment vibrations can prolong electronic coherent effects . </S>",
    "<S> the moderately low decoherence rate of band 1 , localized on the inner layer and protected from solvent , is the basis for exciton - vibrational coupling as the source of long - lived beating signals . the outer band 2 , even though resonantly coupled to a vibration , exhibits a higher decoherence rate and therefore fails to produce observable oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the mere resonance between excitons and vibrations does _ not _ suffice to explain long - lived beating signals . </S>",
    "<S> an adequately low electronic decoherence rate , determined by the interaction between system and bath , is an equally important prerequisite .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of vibronic coupling on energy transport in molecular aggregates has been extensively studied in the past , as recently reviewed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vibronic coupling has recently gained new interest ( see ref.@xcite for a recent tutorial overview ) , as it was suggested as a feasible mechanism to explain long - lived oscillations in the 2d spectra of several natural light harvesting complexes and a photosynthetic reaction center@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of exciton - vibrational resonance is readily satisfied in such systems , given their numerous excitonic bands and rich vibrational structures . </S>",
    "<S> incoherent models based upon correlated fluctuations were not ruled out though . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides a quantum mechanical foundation for enhanced energy transfer based on vibronic coupling . </S>",
