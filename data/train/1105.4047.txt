    "this work is continuing our efforts in studying the detailed chemical composition of stars in open clusters ( tautvaiien et al .  2000 , 2005 ;",
    "mikolaitis et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "open clusters have several very valuable features : they ensemble stars with a common age , initial chemical composition , and distance ; they are distributed across the entire galactic disc and span a wide range of ages ; stars inside a cluster are in different evolutionary stages .",
    "this makes open clusters valuable sources of information in many areas of astrophysical investigations .    in this work ,",
    "our target of investigation is the open cluster ngc2506 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the galactic orbit of this cluster was determined by carraro & chiosi ( 1994 ) .",
    "it was found that the orbit of ngc2506 has a small eccentricity ( @xmath8 ) and epicyclical amplitude ( @xmath9  kpc ) , suggesting that it has not moved far away from the site of formation .",
    "the orbit remains confined at radial distances between 10.7 and 11.6  kpc , and along the @xmath10-direction does not extend beyond 0.6  kpc .",
    "since the first studies by van der bergh & sher ( 1960 ) and purgathofer ( 1964 ) , ngc2506 has quite many references in the literature . relative proper motions for 724 stars in the region of ngc2506 have been determined and probabilities of membership derived by chiu & van altena ( 1981 ) . according to the recent studies , ngc2506 is a mildly elongated cluster containing about 1090 stars ( chen , chen & shu 2004 ) , its generally accepted age is @xmath11  gyr ( marconi et al .",
    "1997 ) , the turn - off mass @xmath12 ( carretta et al",
    ".  2004 , hereafter c04 ) , its galactocentric and heliocentric distances are @xmath13  kpc and @xmath14  kpc respectively ( bragaglia & tosi 2006 ) .",
    "a high resolution spectroscopic observation of ngc2506 has been obtained already 30 years ago by geisler ( 1984 ) . for the star 22012 , a surprisingly low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath15@xmath16 )",
    "was determined and [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] were found to be rather large ( 0.8  dex ) .",
    "metallicity determinations using washington system photometry were also presented for this cluster in the same paper , with value of @xmath17  dex using the @xmath18 colour index and of @xmath19  dex using @xmath20 . later photometric observations of this cluster indicated quite a low metallicity as well .",
    "a value of @xmath3}=-0.55 $ ] relative to the hyades was determined from @xmath21 and ddo photoelectric photometry and @xmath22 and @xmath23 photographic photometry by mcclure , twarog & forrester ( 1981 ) . using the same observational data and a new calibration , piatti , claria & abadi ( 1995 ) have determined @xmath3}=-0.48 $ ] . from washington photoelectric photometry",
    "@xmath3}=-0.58 $ ] was determined by geisler , claria & minniti ( 1992 ) .",
    "however , a higher metal abundance of @xmath24  dex was obtained from high resolution spectroscopy by c04 , as averaged from two stars .    in this work",
    ", we analysed four stars in ngc2506 observed by c04 . using a carefully selected line - list",
    ", we redetermined the main atmospheric parameters , derived abundances of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and nitrogen , which will contribute to the expansion of a database on abundances of mixing - sensitive chemical elements in open clusters .",
    "the degree of mixing in stars largely depends on their masses and metallicities .",
    "the available number of open clusters investigated so far is far from sufficient in order to make reliable models of stellar evolution ( charbonnel & lagarde 2010 , mikolaitis et al .  2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "the data on abundances of heavier chemical elements in ngc2506 will be used to study time evolution of abundances in the galactic disc within the bologna open cluster chemical evolution ( bocce ) study ( bragaglia & tosi 2006 ; carretta , bragaglia & gratton 2007 ) .",
    "the spectra of four stars ( ngc2506 438 , 443 , 456 and 459 ) were obtained with the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) mounted at the 1.5  m telescope in la silla ( chile ) by c04 .",
    "two stars ( 438 and 443 ) belong to the red clump , the star 456 is a first - ascent giant , and the star 459 is an red giant branch ( rgb)-tip giant ( see fig .  1 for the colour - magnitude diagram of ngc2506 with these stars indicated ) .",
    "small portions of the spectra are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath27 and the full wavelength range is @xmath28 37008600 .",
    "the spectrum of rgb - tip star 459 has the highest signal - to - noise ratio @xmath29 , while s / n of the spectrum of star 456 , which lies below the clump , is only 35 .",
    "the log of observations and s / n for individual stars are presented in the paper by c04 .",
    "epsf    =    since the s / n ratios of stellar spectra observed in this cluster were much lower than in the other open clusters observed by c04 and investigated in our previous papers ( mikolaitis et al .  2010 , 2011 ) , we decided to try to redetermine the main atmospheric parameters of stars in ngc2506 using more strictly selected lines .",
    "effective temperature , surface gravity and microturbulent velocity were derived using traditional spectroscopic criteria .",
    "the preliminary values of effective temperatures were derived using @xmath30 colour indices and the temperature calibration by alonso , arribas & martinez - roger ( 2001 ) . the interstellar reddening value @xmath31 , as averaged from four determinations ( marconi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ; kim et al .",
    "2001 ; and dias et al .",
    "2002 ) , was taken into account .",
    "the spectroscopic effective temperatures were derived by minimizing a slope of the abundances obtained from neutral fei lines with respect to the excitation potential .",
    "differences between the photometric and spectroscopic effective temperatures did not exceed 100  k. the gravities ( log  @xmath32 ) were derived by forcing measured neutral and ionised iron lines to yield the same [ fe / h ] value by adjusting the model gravity .",
    "the microturbulent velocities were determined by forcing fei abundances to be independent of the equivalent widths of lines .",
    "the atlas models with overshooting were used for an analysis of the spectra .",
    "spectral lines were restricted to the spectral range 55008000 in order to minimize problems of line crowding and difficulties in the continuum tracing in the blue region .",
    "after the careful selection , the number of fei lines initially analysed by c04 was reduced from 137102 to 4749 in the brighter stars and from 83 to 35 in the fainter star ngc2506 456 .",
    "the number of feii lines was reduced from 1310 to 65 , respectively .",
    "this allowed us to minimize the scatter and increase the accuracy of the abundance and stellar atmospheric parameter determinations .",
    "the determined atmospheric parameters and iron abundances for the observed stars in ngc2506 are presented in table  1 .",
