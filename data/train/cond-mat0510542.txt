    "the substitutional insertion of a point defect impurity into an otherwise perfect host crystal will typically modify the spectrum of the @xmath0 normal modes of the crystal,@xcite leading in certain circumstances ( such as the insertion of impurities which are lighter in mass than the host atoms which they replace or which are more strongly coupled to the host crystal atoms than the ones they replace ) to the generation of modes with frequencies which lie beyond the band maximum @xmath1 of the crystal .",
    "such modes will not be plane waves which propagate throughout the crystal , but will instead fall off exponentially fast away from the defect site and thus be localized to it .",
    "moreover , with the rest of the crystal atoms not participating appreciably in such localized modes , the intensity of the defect in such modes will be @xmath2 times larger than the intensity it would otherwise have had in a crystal plane wave mode , to thus give the localized mode enough intensity to render it observable .",
    "while such modes could be of relevance for phenomena such as the @xmath3 effect associated with the insertion of @xmath3 active defects into host crystals , historical recoil - free fraction @xmath3 studies only involved an averaging over all the lattice modes of the system , to thereby only allow one to infer the possible presence of localized modes indirectly .",
    "however , with the advent of dedicated synchrotron rings it became possible to monitor @xmath3 active systems mode by mode directly ; and via nuclear resonant inelastic x - ray scattering studies , modes lying beyond the host crystal phonon band maximum have now explicitly been seen in the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 systems.@xcite consequently , knowing whether the insertion of a defect into pure crystal hosts might generate localized modes can be of great value for such studies .    in this paper",
    "we use a very straightforward trace technique to enable us to identify some very general conditions under which such localized modes can be produced .",
    "we shall restrict our study to the most straightforward case of single point defects which are substitutionally inserted in the three primitive simple , body - centered and face - centered cubic crystals ( these specific cases being amongst the most commonly experimentally studied ones ) , though with our approach being quite generic , it could in principle be adapted to encompass other crystal structures as well if desired .",
    "we shall provide results for various combinations of mass and force - constant changes , some which are specific to nearest - neighbor force - constants and some of which are general to all - neighbor force - constants . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the trace condition on which all of our results are based , with the provided relation ( eq . ( [ 15 ] ) below ) being an exact , all - neighbor relation which permits an arbitrary mass change ( @xmath6 replaced by @xmath7 ) at the defect site and arbitrary force - constant changes between the defect atom and any other atom in the entire crystal , despite which the resulting relation only involves the self - force constant @xmath8 at the defect site and the change @xmath9 in it . in sec .",
    "iii we apply our trace condition to the case of an isotopic substitution where the only change is that in the mass at the defect site , to show that while having a lighter impurity ( @xmath10 ) is necessary for the generation of a localized mode , it is the condition @xmath11 which is the sufficient one . in secs .",
    "iv and v we apply our trace condition to some straightforward nearest - neighbor force - constant change cases for which there are extremely simple exact analytic solutions to the impurity problem ( some typical examples of which being crystals with force - constants which are central or which are isotropic ) , to find that for all of them the sufficient condition for localized mode production by force - constant changes alone is given as the requirement that @xmath12 be greater than @xmath13 . finally in sec .",

    "( [ 47 ] ) being continuous , the change on the left - hand side must be continuous as well .",
    "consequently , with the transition from curve @xmath126 to curve @xmath139 needing to also be continuous , the lowest impure crystal eigenfrequency must then have continuously traversed the lowest lying of the pure crystal asymptotes on its way , with the lowest lying pure crystal eigenfrequency then being an impure crystal eigenfrequency at the point at which the asymptote is reached .",
    "since @xmath71 is infinite at any pure crystal eigenfrequency , for such a pure crystal eigenfrequency to also be a mode of the impure crystal , @xmath123 must equally be infinite at the pure crystal eigenfrequency , and it indeed is in this particular case since an increase in mass and an increase in force - constant act oppositely in @xmath69 , to thereby allow @xmath69 to indeed vanish at the lowest pure crystal eigenfrequency .    an alternate way to modify the curve @xmath126 is not to change the mass at the defect site at all , but to keep @xmath7 fixed at @xmath6 and to instead start to allow an @xmath9 which is already bigger than @xmath8 to get even bigger .",
    "such an increase will cause all of the impure crystal eigenfrequencies of fig .",

    "( [ 48 ] ) that in the force - constant change case no matter what value we allow for @xmath145 , the perturbed eigenmodes are unable to ever leave their respective frequency compartments .    despite this",
    "though , since @xmath146 does have asymptotes , it can be expected that @xmath146 would change sign on its way between adjacent asymptotes ( though it could drop to some minimum and then go back to the next asymptote without ever changing sign ) , and thus we can anticipate that there will be some frequencies at which @xmath146 can take an assigned value equal to one . at such frequencies the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) would then diverge , and since @xmath146 ( and thus @xmath71 ) is not itself diverging at those points , such points would not be solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) , but would instead be points between pure crystal eigenfrequencies at which the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) would undergo a discontinuity .",
    "now while such a discontinuity can not take the eigenmode out of its frequency compartment , if the discontinuity is to have any effect at all , its only possible one would be to move the eigenmode out of the @xmath120 mode sector determinant altogether . specifically ,",
    "unlike the case of a perturbation of a central force - constant crystal where the @xmath120 sector determinant accounts for all of the perturbed crystal eigenmodes , once we introduce non - central force - constants we have to consider the possibility that eigenmodes could move into the determinantal blocks of @xmath172 which are associated with the other irreducible octahedral representations of the cluster as given in eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "however , recalling that all such eigenmodes are also controlled by eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , and recalling that all the pure lattice green s functions which appear in eq .",

    "( [ 15 ] ) is a sum over all of the modes of the crystal and not just over those associated with the @xmath120 sector alone ( a sum that thus includes the entire cluster of eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) anyway ) , and since we are only making a small change on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) , when the eigenmodes do move to other irreducible representations , they can still only move to equivalent compartments with the same frequency ranges as the ones they started in . as such then , independent of which specific sector the modes actually find themselves in after crossing any @xmath173 discontinuity , they could only cross into the same frequency compartments they were already in .    however , once the eigenmodes have moved out of the @xmath120 sector , they would then be in some other irreducible @xmath118 representation where the @xmath120 mode eq .",
    "( [ 48 ] ) would not apply . hence in these other representations additional changes in @xmath145 ( beyond the ones needed to first bring the force - constant dependent @xmath146 of eq .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) to one ) could perhaps then move the eigenmodes into adjacent compartments .",
    "however , for that to happen the eigenmodes would have to cross the pure crystal asymptotes , with those particular eigenmodes then needing to be common eigenmodes of both the pure and impure crystals at the requisite value of @xmath145 .",
    "however , in order for an eigenmode to be an eigenmode at all , the eigenmode would need to be at a zero of the full @xmath172 , i.e. it would not only need to be at a zero of the determinantal block of some particular irreducible sector , but also to not give an infinite value to any of the other blocks which multiply the given determinantal block of interest in the full @xmath172 of the full crystal .",
    "however , inspection of the @xmath120 mode @xmath143 of eq .",
    "( [ 42 ] ) shows that it is actually divergent at a pure crystal eigenmode ( where it diverges as @xmath174 ) , and thus once there is no asymptote crossing in the @xmath120 mode sector , there can not be any in any other irreducible representation either . thus regardless of whether or not the @xmath173 discontinuities take the impure crystal eigenmodes out of the @xmath120 sector , the modes can not leave the frequency compartments they were already in when @xmath145 was zero .",
    "hence if a mode already was in the compartment which lies beyond the pure crystal maximum eigenfrequency when the parameter @xmath145 was equal to zero , the mode will remain beyond the band no matter how @xmath145 might then vary .",
    "moreover the in - band modes will remain in which ever compartments they had been in when @xmath145 was zero .",
    "we thus recognize two specific consequences of switching @xmath145 on , namely that modes have to stay within their respective @xmath175 compartments , but that they are no longer prevented from traversing the zeroes of @xmath71 .",
    "thus suppose we start off with a central force - constant crystal with @xmath175 and @xmath129 , and with @xmath176 conveniently set right at the threshold value of @xmath13 , and then slowly switch @xmath145 on .",
    "the in - band modes could now move up or down , moving to no lower than the immediately previous pure crystal eigenmodes ( net shift of the in - band mode @xmath88 $ ] of down to @xmath177 ) , or moving upwards possibly as far as the next immediate pure crystal asymptotes ( net shift of up to @xmath178).@xcite then regardless of what value @xmath145 may actually take and regardless of which particular irreducible representation any specific eigenmode may actually lie in , eq .",
    "( [ 41 ] ) will nonetheless still hold when there is no mass change since the trace is taken over the entire set of irreducible @xmath118 representations and not just over the @xmath120 mode .",
    "on recalling that @xmath179 for a nearest - neighbor crystal , we see that the necessary condition that @xmath180 be positive is given by having the in - band modes move down as far as they possibly can , to thereby require @xmath9 to be positive , while the sufficient condition is given by having the in - band modes move up by as far as they possibly can , viz . @xmath181 with the condition that @xmath140 be greater than two thus being sufficient to guarantee the generation of localized modes by force - constant changes alone in an arbitrary nearest - neighbor cubic crystal .",
    "to proceed beyond nearest neighbors is also not straightforward as no exact analog of eqs .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) is currently known .",

    "( [ 20 ] ) would be much larger , and even though more pure lattice green s functions would be required , nonetheless every single one of these green s functions would still have exactly the same asymptote and compartment structure as @xmath71 .",
    "thus if we start at the eigenmodes of a general nearest - neighbor crystal with non - zero @xmath145 and @xmath129 and slowly start to increase the strength of the non - nearest neighbor force - constants ( central or otherwise ) , we would again be constrained by the same set of pure crystal compartments in exactly the same way as before ( save that there would be yet more irreducible representations of @xmath118 to migrate to  with all of them also contributing to the left - hand side of the trace condition ) , to again allow us to infer that even in the most general possible case imaginable ( arbitrary central and non - central force - constants and arbitrary number of participating neighbors ) , in the absence of any change in mass , the condition @xmath183 would still be sufficient to guarantee localized modes.@xcite              the force - constants yielded by potentials for which @xmath185 is zero when the atoms are in their equilibrium positions are referred to as being central , while those associated with potentials which obey @xmath186 at equilibrium are referred to as being isotropic .    even though @xmath153 involves a @xmath0-dimensional sum on both @xmath54 and @xmath187 , the @xmath188 term in the expression for @xmath153 only permits the @xmath187 sum to contribute once , since in the basis in which @xmath189 is diagonalized we can choose the polarization vectors @xmath190 so that only one polarization eigenvector has a non - zero @xmath40 component .",
    "the function @xmath153 thus only possesses @xmath2 poles , poles then also possessed by @xmath191 and @xmath192 as well , with the full @xmath0 dimensionality of the eigenfrequencies then being recovered via the existence of eigenmode equations for all three of @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 in eq .",
