    "galaxy growth is one of the fundamental processes linking structure formation and the observable universe .",
    "the connection between the evolution of ( dark matter - dominated ) structures and the `` baryon physics '' of galaxy formation is the `` holy grail '' of extragalactic astrophysics . galaxy mergers lead both to the mixing of the stellar component already in place in the progenitors , and to gas inflows that provide newly formed stars . in particular , massive galaxies are one of the best targets to put these processes to the test . at present ,",
    "the most widely accepted theory for the formation of massive galaxies relies on a two - step scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an early stage of collapse and efficient star formation _ in - situ _ builds the core of massive galaxies , whereas the outer regions are populated by stars formed _ ex situ _ , incorporated in the galaxy during subsequent merging events .",
    "this theoretical scenario was motivated by the observations of compact , massive galaxies at high redshift ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in contrast with their more extended counterparts at lower redshift .",
    "studies of the stellar populations in these compact systems reveal a growth mechanism driven by the accretion of the stellar components of companion galaxies through merging , ruling out significant levels of in situ star formation during this growth phase @xcite .",
    "simulations provide grounds for this interpretation @xcite , although there are still important aspects , such as the radial gradients in the age and chemical composition of the populations within galaxies , that require more work . whilst the outer regions of massive galaxies are expected to originate mostly from minor mergers @xcite",
    ", the old stellar ages found in the outskirts of massive early - type galaxies @xcite reveal an important environment - related effect on the progenitor ( minor - merging ) systems .",
    "the stellar populations of satellites located dynamically close to massive galaxies are expected to be incorporated into the merged system .",
    "therefore , a simple but effective way to study merging systems is based on samples of galaxies involving very close pairs in projected distance and relative velocity , i.e. those that would be expected to merge within a relatively short time ( see , e.g * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , serving as a low - resolution ( r@xmath350 ) spectrograph . the age of the populations in galaxies dynamically close to massive galaxies was found to obey the same mass - age relationship as galaxies in the field .",
    "that study was complete down to a 1:30 stellar mass ratio , suggesting that such a scenario would not be compatible with the flat age gradients found in massive etgs , unless the net mass fraction provided by minor mergers was small .",
    "furthermore , a number count analysis supported the idea that mass ratios closer to @xmath31:3 dominate this growth channel in massive galaxies .",
    "an extension of this study to a very large sample of low - z galaxies from sdss @xcite confirmed that mass ratios in the region 1:5 are more important than minor merging systems ( typically defined by mass ratios below 1:10 ) .",
    "this project focuses on a more accurate determination of the properties of stellar populations , taking advantage of the high density of optical spectra available in gama ( with respect to sdss ) to build a catalogue of galaxy spectra comprising dynamically close pairs with at least one massive galaxy ( the dr2 gama catalogue already includes over 15,000 galaxies with stellar mass above @xmath0m@xmath1 ) .",
    "these pairs are the progenitors of merged systems , and via comparisons with numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is possible to derive the actual merger rates as a function of the mass ratio .",

    ". this paper aims at measuring the properties of the stellar populations of the merger progenitors with respect to stellar mass , mass ratio , and environment .",
    "the targeted close pairs are expected to merge at later times , mixing up their stellar populations .",
    "depending on the dynamical characteristics of the system ( mainly the merger mass ratio ) , it is possible to infer the properties of the radial gradients of stellar population properties in massive galaxies at later times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this work complements the recent gama - based study of @xcite , devoted to the trends of star formation diagnostics in close pairs .",

    "note lower mass galaxies dominate the sample at low redshift and at lower srsic indices . regarding the size of the galaxy with respect to the fibre size",

    "the preparation of the stacked spectra follows the same methodology as for the satellite sample (   [ ssec : stack ] ) , although the adopted fiducial velocity dispersion is 250kms@xmath7 . in ( a )",
    "the balmer line indices show a trend towards older populations in galaxies with a satellite ( red ) , consistent with the higher 4000  break . the trend appears stronger in d@xmath30(4000 ) .",
    "one could expect this result from the fact that balmer indices are mostly sensitive to recent episodes of formation ( within @xmath601 - 2gyr ) , whereas d@xmath30(4000 ) varies over a wider range of stellar ages ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the interpretation of the 4000  break index gets more complicated in old populations such as those expected in massive galaxies , where the degeneracy with respect to metallicity is more pronounced .",
    "the metallicity indices mgb and [ mgfe]@xmath55 also show an increased strength in those primary galaxies with a nearby satellite , whereas @xmath56fe@xmath57 does not show any variation . in ( b and c ) , segregated with respect to group mass , some differences are apparent , although weaker , except for cn2 , which has a pronounced variation with the luminosity - weighted halo masses .",

    "the metallicity differences ( through mgb and [ mgfe]@xmath55 ) are also weak , with differences between the methodology used to derive halo masses .",

    "[ fig : cenews ] may suggest an overall [ mg / fe ] enhancement in massive galaxies with a satellite . following the simple proxy of [ mg / fe ] presented in @xcite , namely comparing the total metallicity when constraining the populations using either mgb or @xmath56fe@xmath57 as a metallicity indicator ( instead of [ mgfe]@xmath55 ) , gives an overall enhanced population of the primary galaxies around [ mg / fe]@xmath68dex , but no discernible difference  within error bars  between the stacks of primary galaxies with and without satellites .",
    "we expect the observed variations in mgb and @xmath56fe@xmath57 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cenews ] , to be caused by a complex combination of age , metallicity and [ mg / fe ] differences .",
    "the weaker trends in the group - selected stacks may be representative , but this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , leaving it to future work .",
    "our results provide an independent approach to the evolution of close galaxy pairs with respect to @xcite , who focused on star formation diagnostics , rather than on the underlying stellar populations .",
    "they found star formation to be suppressed in secondary galaxies involving minor mergers .",
    "this is equivalent to the older populations found in satellites around the most massive primary galaxies ( red lines at the low - mass end in figs .",
    "[ fig : ews ] and [ fig : age ] ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that stellar populations provide a cumulative ( integral ) picture of the past star formation history , whereas a star formation diagnostic gives the `` instantaneous '' ( differential ) version of the same process , more specifically within the last @xmath3100myr . therefore , the study of @xcite is more sensitive to recent events triggering star formation , whereas this work reveals a deeper connection with environment over longer timescales ( @xmath69gyr ) .",
    "these results are also consistent with the radial gradients found in massive early - type galaxies , with a dominant old and metal - poor component in the outer regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "taking advantage of the uniform spatial completeness of the gama survey , we select a sample of dynamically close pairs involving at least one massive ( stellar mass @xmath70m@xmath1 ) galaxy , over the redshift range @xmath2 .",
    "the study focuses on the stellar populations of the satellite galaxies through a targeted set of spectral features .",
    "since the populations in the primary and secondary galaxies will eventually merge , this study provides insight on the dominant growth channel of massive galaxies during the so - called `` second '' , ex - situ phase . due to",
    "the s / n and flux calibration characteristics of the gama / aat spectra , the analysis is based on a continuum - subtracted version of the data , stacking individual spectra according to two parameters : a `` local '' observable  the stellar mass of the satellite , and an environment - related observable , using either the mass of the primary galaxy , or the group ( i.e. dark matter halo ) mass .",
    "in addition to the well - known local trend between age / metallicity and galaxy mass , we find a significant environmental trend in the stellar populations , so that _ at fixed mass _ , satellite galaxies linked to more massive primary galaxies appear older .",
    "this trend is especially apparent at the low mass end of our sample ( satellite mass @xmath4m@xmath1 ) , where the ssp - equivalent age differences are @xmath312gyr .",
    "this age difference decreases towards the more massive satellites , and it is most significant when considering either the mass of the primary or the group mass as the environment - related parameter .",
    "the data can not disentangle the effect between these two .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to the recent study of close pairs using star formation diagnostics @xcite , this work focuses on the stellar populations , providing insight into the star formation processes over longer timescales .",
    "the consistency of these results reinforce the idea that galaxy - related processes due to the primary must play an important role on the observed differences , and that the trends with respect to group halo mass may be inherited from the intrinsic correlation between the two",
    ". therefore , our results are consistent with the general picture of galactic conformity @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy is robustly found as the main indicator of the properties of its underlying stellar populations .",
    "however , at fixed stellar mass , the population of satellite galaxies have more in common with the corresponding central in its group . in this work",
    ", this conformity appears in the age of the stellar populations : if the primary galaxy is older ( roughly more massive ) , the age of the secondary is older than that of another secondary _ with the same stellar mass _ , orbiting a less massive , thus younger , primary .",
    "such a result is also consistent with the observed lack of age gradients in giant early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "these observational trends should provide useful constraints for numerical simulations of galaxy formation , where the internal age and metallicity gradients are very sensitive to the sub - grid physics ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
