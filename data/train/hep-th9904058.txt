    "random matrices are useful for a wide range of physical problems . in particular",
    ", they can be related to two - dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields with a non - zero central charge @xmath1 @xcite . while @xmath2 models are relatively well understood",
    ", the @xmath3 domain remains almost totally unknown : there is a @xmath4 `` barrier '' . when studying @xmath5 models , we are led to consider multi - matrix models @xcite which are often non - trivial .",
    "one class of difficult matrix models corresponds to the @xmath6-state potts model ( in short : potts-@xmath6 ) on a random surface .",
    "this model is a @xmath6-matrix model where all the matrices are coupled to each other , thus making difficult the use of usual techniques such as the saddle point or the orthogonal polynomials method .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7 limit corresponds to @xmath8 , thus , by solving potts-@xmath6 models , we shall gain a new understanding of the @xmath4 barrier .    in this letter , we show that , contrary to what was previously thought , one can use the loop equations to solve the potts-3 random matrix model , and we find that the resolvent ( which generates many of the operators of the problem ) obeys an algebraic equation that we write explicitely .",
    "we also show that this method applies when one adds branching interactions ( gluing of surfaces , also called `` branched polymers '' ) @xcite and we derive the critical line of this extended model .",
    "the extension to the model with branching interactions and the study of its phase diagram is necessary to verify @xcite s conjecture about the @xmath4 transition .",
    "finally , we apply the method to the potts-@xmath0 matrix model , which corresponds to @xmath9 .",
    "as this work was approaching its completion , a paper appeared on the dilute potts model @xcite , which partially overlaps our present work . in this article",
    ", the author also has an algebraic equation for the conventional potts-3 model . here",
    ", we go further as we consider the potts-3 + branching interactions model .",
    "moreover , his method is quite different : while he uses analytical considerations on the resolvents and large-@xmath10 techniques , we solve our model by the loop equations method , which can be extended to finite @xmath10 problems and is also more adapted to the use of renormalization group techniques @xcite .",
    "let us define :    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14 .",
    "we shall also use later the notation @xmath15 + @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 hermitean matrices .",
    "@xmath25 is a general two - variable function , and will mainly appear through its partial derivatives @xmath26 and @xmath27 with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "if these are constants , then we recover the conventional potts-3 model ( no branching interactions ) .",
    "this model was given partial solution by j.m .",
    "daul @xcite , by considering the analytic structure of the resolvents .",
    "he had its critical point and its associated critical exponent .",
    "he did not know , however , if the resolvent obeyed an algebraic equation .",
    "we shall give here the expression of this equation for the conventional and extended potts-@xmath30 model .",
    "we also derive the critical line of the extended model and check it corresponds to daul s result in the particular case of the conventional model .",
    "+ let us note , for convenience : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 can be @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "this trace is non - zero if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the expectation value of @xmath40 : @xmath41 a trace will be said to be `` of degree @xmath42 '' if there are @xmath42 matrices @xmath16 in it .",
    "for example , the above trace is of degree @xmath43 .",
    "+ let us now use the method of the equations of motion ( or loop equations ) . if we make the infinitesimal change of variables in @xmath44 : @xmath45 with @xmath46 then we obtain the expression of the general equations of motion : @xmath47    the first three terms come from the transformation of @xmath48 , and the last one , from the jacobian of the transformation .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) relates any expectation value of trace containing a quadratic term ( i.e. a @xmath49 term ) to expectation values of traces of lower degrees .",
    "the problem is that we do not have any recursion relation for more general expectation values like @xmath50 where all the @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , when one wants to compute even a very simple trace : for example @xmath52 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , one obtains , @xmath53 $ ] steps later , a @xmath54 $ ] degree complicated trace which does not contain quadratic terms any more .",
    "thus , the recursion stops there .",
    "in fact , this problem can be overcome by a very simple idea : one uses the invariance of traces by cyclic permutations to get rid of the @xmath55 degree term in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "then , one obtains relations between general traces , and it is thus possible to compute the expectation values of any trace in function of the first ones .",
    "let us see now how this idea applies to the computation of the resolvent .",
    "we denote : @xmath56 @xmath57 is the usual resolvent . using the change of variables : @xmath58 we obtain the equation : @xmath59 similarly , @xmath60 yields : @xmath61 and , by the means of similar changes in variables , we have the equations : @xmath62 @xmath63    these equations alone are not sufficient to compute @xmath64 . indeed ,",
    "if we intend to calculate @xmath64 , we generate the function @xmath65 ( eq .  ( [ e10 ] ) ) .",
    "then , in turn , we generate the function @xmath66 ( eq .  ( [ e12 ] ) ) and so on .    as for @xmath67 functions containing a @xmath37 ( i.e. a @xmath49 term ) such as @xmath68 , they are easy to deal with : we know how to compute traces containing @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath69 , will be seen as @xmath70 .",
    "then the change in variables : @xmath71 yields ( @xmath72 for symmetry reasons ) @xmath73 and similar changes in variables lead to the equations : @xmath74 @xmath75    but , to compute @xmath76 , as mentionned in the comments to eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , we have to substract two different changes in variables and use cyclicity of traces : @xmath77\\ ] ] yields : @xmath78 this equation , as we know how to compute @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , relates @xmath76 to @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 allows us to relate similarly @xmath83 to @xmath85 .",
    "then @xmath86 allows us to relate @xmath87 to @xmath88 , and we have @xmath89 as the roles of @xmath90 and @xmath19 are completely symmetric .",
    "+ finally , as a result of these operations , we have : @xmath91 where @xmath92 only contains easy to compute @xmath67 functions .",
    "we can then write an equation for @xmath83 and thus for @xmath76 which only involves @xmath67 functions that we either already know or are able to compute similarly as was done during the two first steps of the procedure .",
    "+ that way , our set of equations is closed , and we obtain a degree five algebraic equation for @xmath64 .",
    "this expression applies to general expressions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for the exact expression of this equation see appendix a. the equation only contains four unknown parameters : @xmath93    these parameters are also those that would be involved if we used the renormalisation group method @xcite to compute the potts-3 model .",
    "the renormalization group flows would relate the conventional potts-3 to the potts-3 + branching interactions model , with arbitrary @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; but the presence of @xmath94 shows us it would also be related to the dilute potts-3 model , where one has a @xmath95 term .",
    "finally , the @xmath96 term shows us it may also be related to more complicated quartic models .",
    "+ we are now going to derive from our equation the critical behaviour and critical line of the model when @xmath97 and @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "this is the most common type of extension of a matrix model to branching interactions .",
    "the values of the unknown parameters given in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) are fixed by the physical constraint that the resolvent has only one physical cut which corresponds to the support of the eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "then , one can study the critical behaviour of the model .",
    "it is easy to look for the potts critical line .",
    "indeed , the scaling behaviour of the resolvent is then , if we denote the physical cut of @xmath67 as @xmath98 $ ] : @xmath99 the corresponding exponent @xmath100 is @xmath101 , which corresponds to the @xmath102 central charge of the model .    rather than looking for the resolvent for any values of the coupling constants ,",
    "it is easier to search for the resolvent only on this critical line where the presence of the @xmath103 exponent leads to simple conditions on the derivatives of the algebraic equation .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath104    let us note here that , when @xmath105 ( no branching interactions ) we recover the potts-3 bicritical point which agrees with daul s result @xcite :    @xmath106    thus , we have shown that the resolvent for the model of potts-@xmath30 plus branching interactions obeys a degree five algebraic equation .",
    "we have found the critical line and exponent of this extended model .",
    "this extends the results of daul @xcite who had only derived the position of the critical point and exponent of the conventional model .",
    "finally , let us recall that , in a recent paper @xcite , p. zinn - justin obtains independently algebraic equations for similar problems .",
    "his method , though , does not involve loop equations , and is rather in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "moreover , it does not address the problem of branching interactions and thus overlaps our results only in the case of the conventional potts-3 model .",
    "we are now going to briefly derive the solution for the potts-@xmath0 model , from the equations of motion point of view .",
    "the purpose of this part is mainly to show the efficiency of our method on this @xmath107 model .",
    "this model was previously studied by wexler in @xcite .",
    "let us denote @xmath108 ,   and  @xmath109 .",
    "+ we shall define the potts - q partition function as @xmath110 @xmath48 is of order @xmath6 when @xmath111 .",
    "first , let us use the equations of motion to relate @xmath112 let us also denote : @xmath113    @xmath114 @xmath115 we can get rid of @xmath116 since , when @xmath117 , @xmath116 remains finite , thus @xmath118 . this is sufficient to relate @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath120 is easy to compute when @xmath121 .",
    "+ let us briefly summarize this computation : we calculate the value of @xmath122 in the @xmath123 limit .",
    "first : @xmath124 ( recall that all the @xmath125 play the same role ) .",
    "if we now separate the first @xmath126 matrices from the remaining @xmath127 ( with @xmath128 ) , and suppose there is a saddle point for the eigenvalues of @xmath129 , then this saddle point is ( in the @xmath130 limit ) independent from the matrices @xmath131 .",
    "then , in this limit , up to a change in variables : @xmath132 , we have @xmath126 independent matrice @xmath133 .",
    "each of them has the partition function @xmath134 as @xmath135 , we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the expectation value obtained with the partition function @xmath138 ( cf eq .",
    "( [ vevc ] ) ) .",
    "+ the matrices @xmath139 all play the same part , and @xmath140 , thus    @xmath141    this must give us @xmath142 , provided we calculate @xmath143 in function of @xmath142 .",
    "this is a solvable problem , but it is much faster to note that @xmath144 is solution .",
    "thus , @xmath145 , and @xmath120 is simply @xmath146 .",
    "+ this gives us immediately the solution for @xmath119 : it obeys a second order equation and reads : @xmath147    the potts-@xmath0 plus branched polymers model is thus very similar to an ordinary pure gravity model . as previously , we compute the parameter @xmath148 by imposing that the resolvent @xmath119 has only one physical cut . the model is critical when @xmath119 behaves as @xmath149 , @xmath150 being a constant , and the critical point verifies ( as in @xcite ) :    @xmath151    let us note finally that the loop equations method used here is appropriate for the renormalization group method of @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that it is possible to solve the potts-3 and potts-@xmath0 models on two - dimensional random lattices through the method of the equations of motion .",
    "we have obtained a closed set of loop equations for the potts-3 model , which was thought to be impossible .",
    "we have shown that the potts-3 resolvent obeys an order five equation , and this new knowledge opens the door to the calculation of expectation values of the operators of the model .",
    "we have extended the potts-3 conventional model to potts-3 plus branching interactions , and given the general algebraic equation and the potts critical line of this model .",
    "finally , we have shown our method also applies successfully to another potts model : the potts-@xmath0 model . while we were working on these models with added branching interactions , though , we had a discussion with p. zinn - justin where it appeared he had another method to solve potts-3 ( and even potts-4 ) matrix model @xcite with dilution terms .",
    "he also obtains algebraic equations for the resolvents .",
    "however , our method is different and , since it relies on the use of the equations of motion , it seems more adapted to the renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have treated potts + branched polymers models in order to compare low @xmath6 to large @xmath6 critical lines and , if possible , renormalization group flows .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( potts-@xmath0 is a @xmath154 model ) models , and we would like to verify if f. david s conjecture @xcite , applied to such models , is right .",
    "this work is still in progress , in particular for large @xmath6 potts + branched polymers models .",
    "we hope to generalize soon our method to more general potts-@xmath6 models , in particular for large-@xmath6 potts + branching interactions models .",
    "here is the degree five equation for the resolvent of this model , where @xmath155 is related to @xmath156 by @xmath157 . + @xmath158 + note that @xmath26 and @xmath27 may depend , in the most general case , on @xmath159 and @xmath160 , the latter being related to @xmath148 through the equation of motion : @xmath161 . in this article , we have computed explicitely the critical line for the particular case of @xmath27 constant and @xmath162 .",
