    "provide unique information on the properties of the system .",
    "based on the geometry provided by the transit light curve(s ) , the inclination , the physical radius and mass , therefore the density and the surface gravity can be derived , in addition to the mass of the planet .",
    "moreover , the time between successive transits can be measured with an exceedingly high accuracy ( @xmath3  ",
    "@xmath4 , relative to the period ) .",
    "the detection of long  term transit timing variations can be used to learn more beyond the properties of the parent - star system @xcite .",

    "secular variations in the semimajor axis ( and therefore in the transit timing ) are also predicted on the time scale of stellar life due to the anisotropic light redistribution ( a.k.a .",
    "yarkovski - effect , see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite has shown that tep observations can in principle also test the gravitoelectric correction of gr by measuring the radial velocity amplitude and transiting periodicity simultaneously , in order to verify that the third kepler s law requires a semimajor axis dependent correction .    in a pioneer study , @xcite derived the modification of the observed time period between successive transits @xmath1 , called transit timing variations ( ttvs ) , caused by the standard periastron precession due to gr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the perturbations of other planets if present .",
    "recently , @xcite have extended these studies and estimated the precision of precession rate measurements for long  term mock observations of eccentric transiting extrasolar planets ( eteps ) .",
    "both studies restricted to small eccentricities . at that time , the existence of close eccentric planets was known only through radial velocity measurements , and no eteps had been observed . since their publication , four transiting extrasolar planets have been discovered with significant eccentricity : xo-3 @xcite , hd  147506 ( a.k.a .",

    "therefore it is now possible , for the first time , to make specific predictions for future , long  term measurements of periastron precession effects for real exoplanetary systems .    in this paper",
    "we determine the precision by which repeated long ",
    "term future etep observations will be able to detect the periastron precession rate for existing systems .",
    "in addition to ttvs , i.e. the slow modulation of @xmath1 considered previously @xcite , the periastron precession also changes the time durations @xmath0 of individual transits .",
    "we examine whether these transit duration variations ( tdvs ) can be used to improve the sensitivity of periastron precession measurements .",
    "we estimate the precession rate measurement precision for long term repeated observations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the known eteps .",
    "since several of the observed eteps have large eccentricities , we derive expressions for both ttvs and tdvs which are applicable for arbitrary eccentricities .",
    "we estimate whether future observations of currently known eteps will be able to reach the sensitivity necessary to test the prediction of gr , using existing or planned space - borne instruments .",
    "we refer the reader to a recent independent study by @xcite , of precession rates in eccentric transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "the next section of this paper introduces the geometrical description which is the basis of our calculations , and derives the expected transit timings and durations for planets orbiting a star with an arbitrarily large eccentricity . in   [ s : realsystems ] , we utilize our results for the confirmed four etep systems , and give predictions for future observations of periastron precession with space - borne observations .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in   [ s : summary ] .",
    "the reference frame used for the description of exoplanetary systems as well as for binary / multiple stellar systems is fixed to the sky : the plane of the sky is defined by the @xmath5 while @xmath6 points towards to north .",
    "for planetary transit observations , the line - of - sight lies close to the orbital plane , i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "the orbit is given by cartesian coordinates @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is parallel to @xmath9 and @xmath10 oriented toward the observer ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the lagrange vector or eccentricity vector is given in these coordinates as @xmath11 .",
    "let us define the angle @xmath12 as the angle relative to @xmath8 in the orbital plane at the instance of the transit . from the definitions of @xmath7",
    ", observing from earth is equivalent to setting @xmath13 .",
    "now let us denote the mean longitude of the planet at the instance of the transit by @xmath14 . for a circular orbit , @xmath15 . from its standard definition in celestial mechanics ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive the mean longitude for arbitrary eccentricities ( see ) .",
    "the result is @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the components of the eccentricity vector relative to the line - of - sight , @xmath19 is the oblateness of the orbit , and @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise . plugging in the observed values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , provides a simple way of calculating the mean longitude of the orbit for an arbitrary transit observation . note that this formalism omits the direct usage of the mean anomaly , true anomaly and eccentric anomaly which have no meanings for @xmath25 .",
    "all of our derived formulae are based on the well  behaved parameters @xmath14 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and therefore are valid for arbitrary eccentricities .    in the following subsections ,",

    "the first four eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems have been discovered during 2007 .",
    "the precession of an eccentric orbit causes variations both in the transit timings and transit durations .",
    "we estimated the significance of measuring the corresponding observable effects compared to the inevitable precession rate of general relativity .",
    "we applied these calculations to predict the significance of measuring the effect for the four known eccentric transiting planetary systems .",
    "our calculations show that a space - borne telescope is adequate to detect the change in the transit durations to a high significance better than the gr periastron precession rate within a 3    4 year timespan ( in a continuous observing mode ) . the same kind of instruments would need more than a decade to detect the corresponding transit time variations to this sensitivity even for the most optimistic known system .",
    "the corot mission has already found two transiting planets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and there are two known planets in the planned field - of - view of the kepler mission ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that if an _ eccentric _ transiting planet is found in the kepler or corot field , these missions will be able to measure the periastron precession rate to a very high significance within their mission lifetime or with the support of ground - based observations on a longer time scale .",
    "this will provide an independent test of the theory of general relativity and will also be useful for testing for the presence of other planets in these systems .",
