    "this is of particular interest for the development of technologies based on quantum mechanics as the environment can , for example , destroy the quantum coherence between different parts of the device and thus completely spoil its functionalities .",
    "various quantum systems affected by dissipative processes have been studied in solid - state physics  @xcite , atomic and molecular physics  @xcite and quantum optics  @xcite . however , at the moment , a complete understanding of the physics of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems coupled to an environment is lacking . in recent years , due to rapid technological progress ,",

    "the system under study is a collection of ultracold atoms in a double well potential under the influence of a dissipative process . as a warm - up ,",
    "we first consider a double well loaded with only two atoms .",
    "this exercise will help us gain a deeper analytical understanding of the combined effect of interaction and dissipation , and show that this interplay leads to a marked slowing down of the decoherence process .",
    "we then study a system with many atoms and demonstrate that the increased complexity of the system results in the emergence of a regime where coherence decays algebraically .",

    "the best starting point is to study a double well loaded with two atoms as this limit can be solved analytically .",

    "an experimental observation of this effect was reported in @xcite .",
    "when the interaction is the dominant energy scale ( for large @xmath8 and large @xmath58 ) , we analytically find that @xmath59 similarly to the quantum zeno regime , here too the decay is strongly suppressed .",

    "we gain deeper insight into the large interaction @xmath67 and/or large dissipation regime @xmath68 via an adiabatic elimination technique  @xcite .",
    "the main idea behind this method is that at long times the dynamics is dominated by the diagonal elements of @xmath15 which dictate the full quantum dynamics .",
    "in fact , their evolution relates to the hopping parameter @xmath6 , the smallest parameter in the system , and connects the diagonal and the off - diagonal elements .",
    "however , the off - diagonal elements evolve very quickly , with a dephasing due to the interaction @xmath7 and/or a fast exponential decay due to @xmath19 . hence , the evolution of the off - diagonal terms can be integrated out and we are left with a coarse - grained evolution for the whole system .",
    "more precisely let us take , for example , the evolution of @xmath69 from ( [ eq : eqrho ] ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath70 here it should be noted that @xmath71 , being far from the diagonal , is much smaller and decays even faster .",

    "( [ eq : ae4a ] ) shows consistently that @xmath50 is the steady state , ( [ eq : ae4b ] ) refers to the slow decaying anti - symmetric solution , which decays at a rate @xmath75 but is not relevant for our dynamics , and the last equation , ( [ eq : ae4c ] ) , represents the symmetric slowest decaying state with a rate @xmath76 from ( [ eq : lqzi ] ) , we derive both the quantum zeno behavior of ( [ eq : lqz ] ) and the `` interaction impeded decoherence '' behavior ( [ eq : li ] ) in their respective regimes ( small and large interactions limits ) .    using ( [ eq : ae2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ae3 ] ) , we compute , at any given time , the coherence of the system knowing only the terms on the diagonal . in particular , the coherence of the slowest decaying state @xmath52 is given by @xmath77 which is proportional to @xmath7 when it is small compared to @xmath78 , and inversely proportional to @xmath7 when it is the dominant energy scale .",
    "thus the large interaction strengths affect the coherence in two ways : @xmath7 lowers the coherence of the slowest decaying state , but at the same time reduces the decay rate @xmath51 .",
    "we now want to understand how the dynamics is altered by the presence of many atoms . as for the two atom case",
    "the interaction was found to play a crucial role in the dynamics , we can expect that the presence of many interacting atoms will affect the dynamics even more dramatically .",
    "we first present a perturbative study at short times highlighting the subtle role played by interactions , we then cover in detail the strongly interacting regime where coherence decays algebraically with time .      to illustrate how interaction influences decoherence , we study perturbatively the time evolution of the coherence .",

    "however , due to the finite interaction strength , the short time evolution is slowed down as @xmath7 opposes the effect of @xmath19 .",
    "this constitutes a first glimpse into the role played by interactions . in the following",
    ", we derive an expression for the decay of the coherence @xmath89 at large times and for a large number of atoms .",

    "this particular case is for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath100 . ]",
    "we observe that the matrix elements corresponding to large density imbalance between the left and right sites , for example @xmath104 or @xmath105 , are much more populated than those with balanced configurations , for example @xmath106 . for a large interaction strength , states with strong imbalance",
    "are highly energetic and thus populating them requires the dissipation to provide a tremendous amount of energy . moreover , in order to populate the state @xmath107 , with @xmath108 large , it is necessary to first populate state @xmath109 which in turns necessitates a long time .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of bosonic atoms in a double well potential under the influence of dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of dissipation is to destroy quantum coherence and to drive the system towards a unique steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the atom - atom interaction affects the decoherence process . </S>",
    "<S> we use a systematic approach considering different atomic densities . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for two atoms , the interaction already strongly suppresses decoherence : a phenomenon we refer to as `` interaction impeded decoherence '' . for many atoms , </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the increased complexity of the system , the nature of the decoherence process is dramatically altered giving rise to an algebraic instead of exponential decay . </S>"
