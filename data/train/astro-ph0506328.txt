    "the energy spectra of blazars has two components .",
    "one component extends from the radio to the x - ray band , while the other is in the gamma ray range .",
    "low energy photons are interpreted to be a result of synchrotron emission by accelerated high energy electrons , and high energy photons are interpreted to be resulted of inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron emission by high energy electrons .",
    "there are two types of blazars , the bl lac type and the qso type .",
    "the bl lac is of two types : high frequency bl lac ( hbl ) and low frequency bl lac ( lbl ) , where the names correspond to the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission and that of the inverse compton emission occur in the radio band and xray band for lbl and in the x - ray band and tev band for hbl .",
    "the tev gamma ray flux of hbls mkn421 and mkn501 are usually lower than that of the crab nebula . in 1997",

    "kranich  @xcite studied both the hegra and asm data during this flare with a fourier analysis and obtained a 22.5 day periodicity with a chance probability of 0.028 for the hegra data and a 22.5 day periodicity with a chance probability of 0.047 for the asm data .",

    "however , he uses an unreliable model of the 1/f noise for deducing a chance probability .",
    "he fitted a raw power spectra to obtain a model of the 1/f noise without discussing model reliability .",

    "we obtain a lower chance probability than kranich  @xcite by an order .",
    "we obtain an error of the periodicity by considering an effect of the 1/f noise and found that the three results are same with a newly estimated error .",
    "we study the stability of the periodicity and analyze an energy spectra of the x - ray satellite _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) during this flare , in order to set a limit on an origin of the periodicity .",
    "we obtained the hegra data  @xcite in 1997 as a form of ( a mjd , flux , an error of flux ) .",

    "we also use a span mjd 50300 - 50900 for the asm data because the asm data is plentiful and we require more than 10 cycles for increasing a reliability of a periodicity .",

    "we fitted each distribution of periodicities with a gaussian and obtain a 1 sigma statistical error of the periodicity .",

    "we estimated an error of a periodicity for a fourier analysis , as described in the previous section : we show this in figure 13 .",
    "we found that the periodicity is unstable with a 3.4 sigma significance .",
    "we create a phase diagram of a photon index for the 23.6 day periodicity , that is , a periodicity for the asm data in mjd 50300 - 50900 , as shown in figure 14 . a clear relation between a photon index and a phase can be observed .",

    "there is an energy spectral change by a synchrotron cooling : however , the time scale is about @xmath54 s  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed relation is related to another physics .",

    "there is an index change from @xmath59 to 0.2 .",
    "we obtain a photon index 2.345@xmath600.015 at a phase of 0.0 and found a negative index with ( 2.345 - 2.000)/0.015=23 sigma significance .",
    "we also obtain a photon index 1.874@xmath600.0084 at a phase of 0.8 and found a positive index with ( 2.000 - 1.874)/0.0084 = 15 sigma significance .",
    "the pca is sensitive to energy from 3 kev to 20 kev .",
    "a negative index means that a peak energy of the synchrotron emission is below 3 kev , and the positive index means that a peak energy of the synchrotron emission is above 20 kev .",
    "therefore , a change in the index from a negative value to a positive value means that the peak energy of the synchrotron emission moves from a low energy to a high energy .",

    "we found that the three results are the same with a newly estimated error . we confirm a 1/f noise in a frequency - power diagram and obtain a chance probability of 4.88@xmath0 for a periodicity in the hegra data by considering a 1/f noise :",
    "this is more significant than the previous result by an order .",
    "we obtain the 23 day periodicity with more than 10 cycles for the asm data .",
    "we also obtain the same periodicity with an epoch folding method for the hegra and asm data .",
    "therefore , we strongly suggest the existence of the 23 day periodicity . we confirm that the phase diagrams of the hegra and asm data are broad .",
    "we found that a width of the periodicity is as narrow as @xmath53 .",
    "we divided the hegra data into two , analyzed these data with a fourier method , and found that a periodicity is unstable with a 3.4 sigma significance .",
    "we analyzed an x - ray energy spectra of mkn501 during this flare and found that a combination of three physical parameters  a magnetic field , a lorentz factor , and a beaming factor  is related to the periodicity and is changed during this flare by @xmath65 .",
