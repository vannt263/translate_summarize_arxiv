    "since the discovery of the low temperature phase transition in npo@xmath1 at @xmath8  k almost fifty years ago , @xcite the magnetic properties of this compound represent a challenge for theoretical interpretation .",
    "@xcite npo@xmath1 and its neighbor in the actinide series , uo@xmath1 , @xcite are both crystallized in the cubic fluorite ( caf@xmath1 ) structure in the high temperature phase .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibilities of these compounds is suggestive for a nel transition to an antiferromagnetic state .",
    "@xcite however , while it was found that uo@xmath1 orders antiferromagnetically ( @xmath9  k ) with 1.74@xmath10/u atom , @xcite no magnetic ordering @xcite was confirmed for npo@xmath1 ( see for a review ref .  ) . as follows from mssbauer experiments @xcite",
    "the upper limit on the magnetic moments of np in the ordered phase is only 0.01@xmath10/np .",
    "this implies almost a complete quenching of the 3.0@xmath10 magnetic moment of np , which it exhibits in the paramagnetic high temperature phase .",
    "the demagnetization of np magnetic moments seems to be incompatible with the widely accepted viewpoint that the np cations are in the tetravalent valence state , np@xmath11 , with three localized 5f electrons left at each neptunium site . with the @xmath4 configuration , np becomes a kramers ion having a magnetic doublet ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) or quadruplet ( @xmath14 ) ground state .",
    "because of this , a divergent susceptibility at @xmath15 will be present in any model of the phase transition .",
    "@xcite    to describe the disappearance of magnetic moments of np at @xmath16 santini and amoretti put forward an idea of a magnetic octupole order parameter , @xcite which on one hand , is not invariant under time reversal symmetry and , on the other hand , is different from the magnetic dipolar order parameter which brings about the ordinary magnetic ordering .",
    "the idea of breaking down of kramers degeneracy by the magnetic octupole seems to be the only solution in the framework of the @xmath4 model . @xcite",
    "an alternative explanation was offered by friedt _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "they suggested that the magnetic anomaly in npo@xmath1 could be explained by a splitting of the ground state @xmath14 quadruplet of cubic symmetry into two doublets in the crystal field of lower symmetry of the ordered phase .",
    "the splitting was ascribed to an internal distortion of the oxygen sublattice at @xmath17 .",
    "this viewpoint was inspired by the experimental observation that the phase transition in uo@xmath1 is accompanied by an internal distortion of the oxygen cube that surrounds the u cation , @xcite while the external cubic structure of uranium dioxides survives the transition .",
    "however , the mechanism mainly weakens the magnetic response from the np sites at 20  k , while the @xmath15 divergence of magnetic susceptibility still persists in the model in contradistinction with experiment .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , no evidence for an internal or external crystallographic distortion in npo@xmath1 has been found by synchrotron experiments .",
    "@xcite thus , the phase transition in npo@xmath1 appears to be isostructural like the @xmath18 phase transition in elemental cerium @xcite ( @xmath19  k ) or the isostructural expansion in ybincu@xmath20 at @xmath21  k. @xcite it is worth mentioning that _ in all these compounds the phase transition is accompanied by a loss of magnetic moments in the ordered phase .",
    "_    however , very recent resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) experiments at the np @xmath22 and @xmath23 edges in npo@xmath1 indicated an unexpected result : the phase transition is not isostructural . @xcite in the low temperature phase a long range order of np electric quadrupoles was revealed by the growth of superlattice bragg peaks .",
    "@xcite the space symmetry of the ordered phase was identified as @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the symmetry lowering is a special one .",
    "the centers of mass positions of neptunium and oxygen remain in the cubic caf@xmath1 structure as in the high temperature phase . however , electronic quadrupoles of the np sites have four different orientations , which allows us to distinguish four different sublattices of np cations .",
    "@xcite    this experimental finding gives rise to a question of correlations between structural and magnetic properties in solids , which we have investigated theoretically in our model of the @xmath18 phase transition in ce .",
    "@xcite unlike npo@xmath1 , pristine cerium is a metal and the phase transition there at normal pressure is accompanied by a huge volume change .",
    "@xcite the volume anomaly in npo@xmath1 ( contraction ) is only 0.018% .",
    "@xcite however , the disappearance of the magnetic moments and the  isostructural \" character of the phase transition makes them similar . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to notice that in our model for ce we have predicted the @xmath3 space symmetry for the ordered @xmath24 phase @xcite which is very close to the @xmath2 structure reported for npo@xmath1 in ref .  .",
    "the active irreducible representation also belongs to the @xmath25 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "while the existence of superstructure reflections for @xmath24-ce remains an open question which has to be investigated experimentally , @xcite here we want to apply our theoretical concepts for the study of the crystal- and mean - field in neptunium dioxide .",
    "we will use the technique of multipole expansion of the coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite the multipole expansion represents a unified description of the crystal field effects and atomic term splitting .",
    "the intrasite coulomb repulsion which is responsible for hund s rules , the spin - orbit coupling and the crystal field effects are included on equal footing .",
    "( for a single site the technique is equivalent to the classical description of atomic terms .",
    "@xcite ) in order to calculate the corresponding electronic spectra we use many slater determinants , which indicates that our scheme is a genuine many electron approach @xcite corresponding to the configuration interaction ( ci ) .",
    "( notice that ordinarily used single - determinant hartree - fock approach is not sufficient for these purposes ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the triple-@xmath0 structures ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) of the ordered phases and derive the selection rules for resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) experiments . in sec .",
    "iii we describe our method for treating local electron configurations at neptunium sites .",
    "next ( sec .",
    "iv ) we examine thoroughly the case of three localized @xmath26 electrons . in sec .",
    "v we generalize the @xmath4 model by including the multipole interactions with a valence electron which is present instantaneously on a np site .",
    "we show that in the framework of this extended model the disappearance of the magnetic moments can be understood and ascribed to the trigonal symmetry lowering at 25  k. our conclusions are summarized in sec .  vi .",
    "in this section we discuss the allowed space groups of the low temperature phase of npo@xmath1 .",
    "our considerations here are based on a general group theoretical approach which is independent of the model assumptions .    in the disordered phase ( @xmath27  k )",
    "the crystal structure is cubic ( @xmath28 ) and the site group is @xmath29 .",
    "the electron density of neptunium is given by the spherically symmetric component ( @xmath30 ) and the cubic harmonics @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "there is no contribution to the density from the quadrupole functions @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "( here and below we work with the real spherical harmonics with the phase definition of ref .  . ) at @xmath38  k the transition to a new phase sets in .",
    "the new phase was characterized as a triple-@xmath39 antiferro- quadrupolar ordering of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) electric quadrupoles at the np sites .",
    "@xcite    in real space the ordering is characterized by four different sublattices of the simple cubic structure .",
    "we label these sublattices which contain the sites ( 0,0,0 ) @xmath42(0,1,1 ) , @xmath42(1,0,1 ) and @xmath42(1,1,0 ) by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the most significant feature of the ordered phase is the existence of only one three - fold axis of symmetry @xmath45 at each np site which is also a cube diagonal .",
    "the only quadrupole function compatible with the symmetry lowering is @xmath46 in the coordinate system where the @xmath47-axis coincides with one of the three - fold axes ( cube diagonals ) : @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 $ ] , and @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "consequently , there are four such functions which are given by    @xmath52    the spherical harmonics @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 belong to a three - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath40 of @xmath29 .",
    "they are proportional to the cartesian components @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .    in ref .",
    "the space group of the ordered phase was identified as @xmath2 ( no .",
    "224 , ref .  ) .",
    "the corresponding ordering of @xmath59 functions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc ] , left panel .",
    "however , a close examination reveals that there is another possibility which was not considered by the authors of ref .  .",
    "this is the @xmath3 structure ( no .",
    "205 of ref .  )",
    "depicted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_struc ] .",
    "the @xmath3 structure also realizes a triple-@xmath39 quadrupolar order , the site symmetry of the np sites is @xmath60 .",
    "the problem of finding the appropriate space group can be simplified to the task of distributing four orientational functions @xmath59 among four distinct sublattices",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 . keeping the three - fold rotation symmetry about the @xmath48 $ ] axis and @xmath61 for the first sublattice",
    ", we distinguish only three different choices here .",
    "the first is when @xmath62 @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "this gives the @xmath2 structure , fig .",
    "[ fig_struc ] , left panel .",
    "another assignment is @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "this scheme corresponds to the @xmath3 structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc ] , right panel .",
    "the third choice is @xmath71 @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "this is simply another variant ( or domain ) of the @xmath3 structure .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "we are analyzing the symmetry lowering and the condensation schemes at the @xmath25 point of the bz of the fcc lattice , which involves the density components of the @xmath40 symmetry . in both cases ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) the triple-@xmath39 mode which drives the structural phase transition belongs to the @xmath25 point of bz @xmath75 , and involves the three arms of the latter , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "to describe the three quadrupolar components @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 at site @xmath82 we introduce the functions @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and consider their fourier transforms , @xmath85 where the position vector @xmath86 runs over @xmath87 sites of the face centered cubic ( fcc ) neptunium lattice .",
    "the little group of @xmath75 is @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . at @xmath90 the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 belong to the @xmath93 small representation , while the function @xmath94 belong to the @xmath95 small representation .",
    "consequently , we distinguish two different irreducible representations of the space group @xmath28 .",
    "the first one , @xmath96 in notations of stokes and hatch , @xcite comprises six orientational functions , with two functions from every arm of @xmath75 .",
    "the functions are @xmath97 , @xmath98 ; @xmath99 , @xmath100 ; @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the second irreducible representation , @xmath103 , has only three components , with one function from each arm of @xmath75 , namely @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . for the symmetry lowering to the @xmath2 structure",
    "we obtain the following condensation scheme : @xmath107 here @xmath108 stand for a quantum and thermal average and @xmath109 is the order parameter amplitude .",
    "the @xmath103 active representation corresponds to the irreducible star @xmath110 and the loaded one - dimensional representation @xmath111 in kovalev s notation .",
    "@xcite there are four domains for the @xmath2 structure .",
    "the condensation scheme for the @xmath3 structure is given by @xmath112 here again @xmath113 is the order parameter amplitude .",
    "this condensation scheme corresponds to a domain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_struc ] , and there are eight possible domains of @xmath3 . in particular , there is a domain @xmath71 which we have already considered before ( @xmath114 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ) when we analyzed the variants of distribution of @xmath59 over four sublattices .",
    "this domain is obtained as a result of the following symmetry breaking @xmath115 previously the symmetry change @xmath116 has been considered in a number of publications , refs .  .",
    "the @xmath96 active representation is defined by the star @xmath110 and the loaded two - dimensional representation @xmath117 in kovalev s notation .",
    "@xcite    although the two structures look similar there is one very important difference between them . _",
    "the @xmath3 ordering corresponds to an effective attraction of the quadrupoles , while the @xmath2 ordering results in a repulsive interaction between them , _ see appendix a for details .",
    "this is the main reason why the @xmath3 structure ( but not @xmath2 ) is found in many molecular solids such as h@xmath1 , n@xmath1,@xcite nao@xmath1,@xcite and c@xmath118.@xcite here we speak about the direct bilinear electronic quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "however , in case of npo@xmath1 there are indirect ( superexchange @xcite ) interactions via oxygen which may lead to an effective attraction and therefore , the @xmath2 structure can not be ruled out . nevertheless , the @xmath3 space group is a good candidate for the symmetry of the ordered phase of npo@xmath1 .",
    "provided that the superexchange interaction remains the same for two structures , the @xmath3 symmetry becomes preferable .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at first the symmetry of the ordered phase of the pristine c@xmath118 molecular crystal was identified as @xmath119.@xcite only later it was corrected and proved to be @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we formulate the technique of multipole expansion of the coulomb interaction and use it to study the crystal electric field and mean field for a number of neptunium many electron configurations ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) on _ ab initio _ level . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the crystal field is rather small ( 50 - 150  k ) . the direct quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between neighboring neptunium sites is weak and can not drive the structural phase transition at 25  k. we have introduced an effective ( enhanced ) quadrupole interaction and considered the interplay between it and the crystal electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of both interactions on the transition temperature has been investigated in detail for the @xmath4 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the importance of the intrasite multipole interaction between three localized electrons ( @xmath4 ) and a valence electron on a neptunium site . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this interaction combined with the symmetry lowering at 25  k may be responsible for the loss of the magnetic moments in the ordered phase of npo@xmath1 . </S>"
