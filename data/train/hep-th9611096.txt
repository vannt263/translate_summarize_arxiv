    "in quantum chromodynamic some field configurations can be interesting for phenomenological bag theory being used for an explanation of quarks confinement .",
    "these configurations have to satisfy to the @xmath0 yang - mills equations and to confine inside itself the quark . for this purpose",
    "the @xmath1 magnetic bags have been constructed in ref s @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where it has been shown that they can contain the fermions in some compact surface . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been also shown that the quantum particles with gauge charge can be confined only inside the domain of the @xmath1 yang - mills field configuration with infinite energy .",
    "recently the spherically symmetric solutions for the @xmath1 yang - mills equations , which are analogous to the black hole gravitational configurations , are founded in ref s @xcite , @xcite .    in this article",
    "i want to show that the classical solutions of the @xmath0 yang - mills theory can have the confining properties and some solutions can be considered as a single quark ( color charge ) and a string ( flux tube ) between two quarks . to do this",
    "we examine the spherically and cylindrically symmetric cases .",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath0 gauge field we take as in @xcite :    [ 1 ] @xmath2    here @xmath3 are the gell - mann matrixes ; @xmath4 is color index ; latin indexes @xmath5 are the space indexes ; @xmath6 ; @xmath7 are the spherically coordinate system . substituting eq s ( [ 1 ] ) in the yang - mills equations : @xmath8 we receive the following @xmath0 equations system for @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions :    [ 3 ] @xmath11    this set of equations is very difficult even for numerical investigations . we will investigate a more simpler case when only two functions are nonzero .",
    "it is easy to see that there can be only three cases .",
    "the first case is well - known monopole case by @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "let us examine the two another interesting cases .",
    "in this case we have @xmath14 condition .",
    "then , the set ( [ 3 ] ) has the following view :    [ 4 ] @xmath15    we seek the solutions which are regular at origin and infinity .",
    "this means that the solution at origin @xmath16 can be expanded into a series :    [ 5 ] @xmath17    after substitution of eq s ( [ 5 ] ) into eq s ( [ 4 ] ) we receive that @xmath18 and @xmath19 coefficients are arbitrary . on the infinity",
    "we seek solutions as a following series :    [ 6 ] @xmath20    analogously , the substitution of eq s ( [ 6 ] ) into eqs([4 ] ) shows that @xmath21 and @xmath22 coefficients are also arbitrary .",
    "the numerical integration of the set ( [ 4 ] ) with initial date ( [ 5 ] ) shows that the solution is singular @xmath23 by some @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the approximate analytical solution near the singularity has the following form : @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 is some constant .",
    "the numerical integration of the set ( [ 4 ] ) with initial data ( [ 6 ] ) shows that here , too , the point @xmath28 exists in which the solution is singular : @xmath29 . in this case",
    "the approximate analytical solution near the @xmath30 point has the following view : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 is also some constant .    selecting coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( or @xmath21 and @xmath22 )",
    ", one can achieve the execution of @xmath34 condition .",
    "the according solution of the set ( [ 4 ] ) ( function @xmath35 ) is presented on fig.1 by @xmath36 .",
    "the graph of @xmath37 function is practically the same .",
    "this solution is a bag with singular walls by @xmath38 .",
    "the similar solution for the @xmath1 gauge field is received in @xcite .      here",
    "we examine @xmath39 case .",
    "the case @xmath40 is analogous .",
    "now the input equations have the following form :    [ 9 ] @xmath41    we seek the regular solution near @xmath16 point . the eq s ( [ 9 ] ) demand that @xmath42 and @xmath43 functions have the following view at origin @xmath16",
    ":    [ 10 ] @xmath44    the numerical integration of eq s ( [ 9 ] ) is displayed on fig.2,3 .",
    "the asymptotical behaviour of received solution @xmath45 is as follows :    [ 11 ] @xmath46 , \\label{11:2}\\\\ 3a^2 & = & \\alpha(\\alpha + 1 ) .",
    "\\label{11:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath47 is dimensionless radius ; @xmath48 are some constants ; @xmath49 . for our potential @xmath50",
    "we have the following nonzero color `` magnetic '' and `` electric '' fields :    [ 12 ] @xmath51    here for eq s ( [ 12:1 ] ) , ( [ 12:2 ] ) and ( [ 12:3 ] ) the color index @xmath52 and for eq s ( [ 12:4 ] ) , ( [ 12:5 ] ) and ( [ 12:6 ] ) @xmath53 . analyzing the asymptotical behaviour of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 fields",
    "we see that they are the strongly oscillating fields .",
    "it is interesting that the radial components of the `` magnetic '' and `` electric '' fields drop to zero variously at infinity :    [ 13 ] @xmath56    among all the ( [ 12 ] ) fields only the radial components of `` electric '' fields are nonoscillating . from eq s ( [ 11 ] ) we see that our solution has the oscillating part ( [ 11:1 ] ) and confining potential ( [ 11:2 ] ) .",
    "it is necessary to mark that obtained solution is solution with arbitrary initial condition , whereas the monopole solution is a special case of the initial condition .",
    "this allows to make a conclusion that the general spherically symmetric solution in the classical yang - mills theory has the confining properties .",
    "although , at the same time there are the oscillating potential , `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields .",
    "the expression for an energy density has the following view : @xmath57 this function is displayed on the fig.3 .",
    "we note the asymptotical form of the energy density followed from ( [ 12 ] ) condition : @xmath58 in the first approximation @xmath59 is nonoscillating on the infinity .",
    "the asymptotical form of @xmath59 leads to that the energy of such solution is infinity .",
    "it is very interesting what happens after quantization .",
    "it is very possible that such procedure smooths these strongly oscillating @xmath0 gauge field . in this case",
    "we will have only nonoscillating confining potential ( [ 11:2 ] ) and moreover , also nonoscillating energy density defined according to ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "what is the physical meaning of this solution ?",
    "it is possible that it is analogous to the coulomb potential in electrostatics .",
    "but an electron can exist in empty space while a quark is not observable in a free state .",
    "therefore , the obtained solution can describe the color charge - `` quark '' .",
    "the quotation marks indicate that we examine the simplified eq s ( [ 4 ] ) instead of complete eq s ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that these two solutions have the fundamental difference among themselves .",
    "the electron has a singularity at origin by @xmath16 , but the `` quark '' at infinity by @xmath60 . in the second case such field configuration has the confining properties .",
    "it should be also noted that this solution has the asymptotical freedom property since at origin @xmath16 the gauge potential @xmath61 .",
    "let us write down the potential as follows :    [ 16 ] @xmath62    here we introduce the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath63 . the color index @xmath53 corresponds to the chosen @xmath64 inclusion .",
    "the yang - mills equations for potential ( [ 16 ] ) are :    [ 17 ] @xmath65    let us examine the simplest case @xmath66 . in this case equation",
    "set is :    [ 18 ] @xmath67    at origin @xmath68 the solution has the following form :    [ 19 ] @xmath69    substituting eqs([19 ] ) into ( [ 18 ] ) system we find that :    [ 20 ] @xmath70    the numerical integration is shown on fig.2,4 .",
    "it can be also shown that asymptotical behaviour of @xmath71 function and energy density @xmath59 is :    [ 21 ] @xmath72 , \\label{21:1}\\\\ v & \\approx & \\sqrt{2 } \\frac{\\sin \\left ( x^2 + \\phi _ 1 \\right ) } { x } , \\label{21:2}\\\\ \\epsilon & \\propto & f'^2 + v'^2 + f^2v^2 \\approx const , \\label{21:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath73 is dimensionless radius ; @xmath74 are some constants .",
    "again we have the confining potential @xmath75 and strongly oscillating potential @xmath76 .",
    "thus , this solution is a hollow or hump ( in accordance with relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 value ) on the background of the constant energy density . on account of its cylindrical symmetry",
    "we can call this solution as a `` string '' .",
    "the quotation marks indicate that this is the string from energetically point of view , not from potential @xmath50 and field @xmath79 point of view .",
    "it can be expected that after quantization the oscillating functions will vanish and only confining potential and constant energy density will stay .",
    "it can be supposed that the obtained solution describes the classical gauge field between two `` quarks '' .",
    "this must be verified using the lattice calculations ( nonperturbative quantization ) .",
    "thus , we receive the classical solutions of the @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "these solutions show us that the confinement is a general property in the classical @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "they are the typical solutions for the ( [ 3 ] ) set since @xmath80 constants are arbitrary . in contradiction of this",
    "the monopole solution is the exceptional solution .",
    "it has the finite energy whereas the typical solutions ( obtained here ) have infinite potential at infinity , infinite energy and consequently the confining properties .",
    "the confining solutions of this kind have the strong oscillating component of gauge potential , `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields . but",
    "it can be expected that these are only the classical properties vanishing in quantum theory .",
    "it can be supposed that the received here solutions have the physical significance : the spherically symmetric case describes either a bag confining the quantum test particle or a classical single `` quark '' ; the cylindrically symmetric case describes a classical field distribution between two `` quarks '' .    in second and third cases ,",
    "the situation greatly differs from that what happens with electron .",
    "an isolated electron exists in nature and it generates the electric field decreases at infinity .",
    "an isolated quark does not exist in nature .",
    "it is possible that it forms the confining field distribution .",
    "the two interacted electrons generate electric field appearing as a superposition of electric field from two electrons .",
    "the two quarks generate the string .",
    "it can be supposed that the gauge `` string '' obtained above is a classical model of such field distribution .",
    "it appears as a string on the background of the field with constant energy density . just the same it should be remarked that here we have also the strong oscillating fields .",
    "these fields maybe will be excluded by quantization .",
