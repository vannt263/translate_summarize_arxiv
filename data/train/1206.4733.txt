    "in the past few years , there has been a rapid progress in the field of topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators have the helically - spin - polarized surface states with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac dispersion , which are observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "tis not only offer an exciting playground for fundamental physics , but also have a variety of potential applications ranging from spintronics @xcite to quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the experiments show that the fermi level is often lifted to the conduction band , thus making the topological surface states less relevant for the properties of real materials @xcite . in part",
    ", this motivated the study of the thin films of tis , where the fermi level , bulk gap and the hybridization between the opposite surface states can be tuned @xcite .",
    "a number of intriguing effects for the ti films were predicted in the case where the top and bottom surfaces interact @xcite . in the ultra - thin limit",
    ", a gap opens in the surface states electronic spectrum due to hybridization between the opposite surfaces @xcite .",
    "while most papers study the in - plane transport properties of the surface states , here we study the tunneling conductance @xmath0 per unit area across the ultra - thin ti film in the presence of a parallel magnetic field @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : film ] ) . the in - plane magnetic field results in a relative shift of the dirac cones of the surface states in momentum space , as discussed in related works on graphene bilayer @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the spectrum of graphene , the spectrum of the ti thin film remains gapped until a critical value of the magnetic field is achieved @xcite .",
    "motivated by the original measurements of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 for a gaas bilayer by eisenstein et al .",
    "@xcite , here we calculate the tunneling conductance for a ti film as a function of the parallel magnetic field . in contrast to other systems , the spin structure of the electronic spectrum for the surface states of ti results in unusual dependence of the tunneling conductance on @xmath1 . in a recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "the authors observed a strong @xmath1 dependence of the out - of - plane current in a film of bi@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "the predicted theoretical dependence @xmath0 vs @xmath1 is in qualitative agreement with the experimental curve .",
    "in addition , we predict that the spin polarization of the tunneling current is proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath4 spin polarization can be achieved for an experimentally accessible strength of the magnetic field .",
    "in a parallel magnetic field @xmath1 . the surface states @xmath5 and @xmath6 shown in red and blue overlap and couple when the thickness @xmath7 is comparable with the decay length @xmath8 of the surface state . ]",
    "let us consider a film of ti , which has two states @xmath5 and @xmath6 localized at the opposite surfaces of the film , as shown in red and blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : film ] .",
    "while the wave functions are localized in the @xmath9 direction , electrons are free to move parallel to the surface , so the in - plane momentum @xmath10 is a good quantum number . for clarity of consideration ,",
    "we model the surface states by the simple rashba hamiltonians @xmath11 different signs @xmath12 correspond to the surface states @xmath5 and @xmath6 and describe the unit rashba vectors @xmath13 , which are collinear with the normals to the corresponding surfaces .",

    "( [ heigenstate ] ) describe the helical spin - momentum locking with the spin polarization perpendicular to the momentum @xmath20",
    "so the helicity  ( [ helical ] ) is opposite for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands . because of the minus sign for @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ h12 ] ) , the bands @xmath24 are energetically - inverted , and , so , the helicities for the opposite surface states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are opposite for a fixed energy .",
    "the wave functions of the surface states @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay into the bulk and have a finite decay length @xmath8 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "so , when the thickness of the film @xmath7 becomes comparable with the decay length @xmath25 , there is a finite coupling between the surface states @xmath26 , which we assume to be proportional to the unit matrix in the spin space .",
    "so , the ti film can be modeled by a @xmath27 hamiltonian @xmath28 , which acts on the 4-component wave function @xmath29 @xmath30 this hamiltonian was also used in ref .",
    "@xcite for description of a thin film .",

    ", the peierls substitution @xmath43 transforms the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) into @xmath44 the zeeman term can be included in the definition of @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "notice that the parallel magnetic field leads to the opposite momentum shifts @xmath46 on the opposite surfaces located at @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , consider an electron traveling between the surfaces with the classical velocity @xmath48 in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "then , the lorentz force @xmath49 results in the in - plane momentum change @xmath50 between the opposite surfaces .",
    "so , in the limit @xmath51 , the spectrum of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamq ] ) is given by the two shifted dirac cones @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shiftedcones ] .",
    "a similar shift of the dirac cones was discussed for graphene multilayer due to a parallel magnetic field @xcite and for a twisted graphene bilayer @xcite . in general , when @xmath32 is not small , the spectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ hamq ] ) was calculated in ref .",

    "( [ sigmageneral ] )  and  ( [ momentumspace ] ) , let us first calculate the tunneling conductance @xmath68 for the charge current @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the fermi momentum . according to eq .",
    "( [ sigmaparallel ] ) , the tunneling current is carried by the electrons that have the in - plane momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to the intersection points of the shifted fermi circles @xmath40 , as shown by the thick dots in fig .",

    "let us first consider the case where is no spin - momentum locking , so @xmath72 and eq .  ( [ sigmaparallel ] ) gives @xmath73 the tunneling conductance @xmath74 diverges at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport](a ) . for a small magnetic field @xmath77 ,",

    "[ fig : shiftedcones](b ) , and the tunneling conductance is large again .",
    "once @xmath80 , the two fermi circles separate , and the tunneling conductance drops to zero . the experimental curve of the tunneling conductance for a gaas bilayer @xcite shows behavior similar to eq .",

    "( [ sigmaparallel ] ) arising from the spinor eigenstates  ( [ heigenstate ] ) of the rashba hamiltonian  ( [ h ] ) .",

    "the form - factor @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ sigmaparallel ] ) takes into account an overlap between the spinors on the different fermi circles and is equal to @xmath84 .",

    "( [ sigmaparallel0 ] ) @xmath86 the tunneling conductance given by eq .",
    "( [ sigmaparallel1 ] ) is plotted by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport](a ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath87 , the tunneling conductance @xmath88 is suppressed as @xmath89 , because spin polarizations of the fermi circles are opposite at the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as shown in fig  [ fig : transport](b ) on the left .",
    "this is a signature of the opposite spin helicity of the fermi circles and thus may be used as a way to detect it . for @xmath45 near @xmath90 , however , the spin configurations are almost aligned , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport](b ) , so , @xmath74 and @xmath91 become equal .",
    "the non - trivial spin structure of the fermi circles not only modifies the tunneling current , but also makes it spin - polarized .",
    "let us define spin polarization as the ratio of the spin current over the charge current @xmath92 where the second equation follows from the definition of the conductance . using the property",
    "that the eigenstates  ( [ heigenstate ] ) have the well - defined spin orientation  ( [ helical ] ) , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ sigmageneral ] ) @xmath93 so , the spin polarization of the tunneling current is determined by the vector sum of the spin directions at the momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 . indeed , in the process of tunneling , the electrons with the in - plane momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 move from the `` blue '' to `` red '' fermi circle , carrying the total spin , which is a vector sum of the spins at the momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ spinpolarization ] ) .",
    "the helical spin configuration  ( [ helical ] ) is such that the net spin polarization @xmath94 is parallel and proportional to @xmath95 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the spins at the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 are opposite , and the spin polarization of the tunneling current vanishes . at @xmath76 ,",
    "the spins at the points @xmath38 and @xmath39 are collinear and the tunneling current is fully spin - polarized .",
    "also , notice that the electron tunneling at @xmath38 changes the spin polarization from the `` blue '' to `` red '' arrow , thus creating a torque @xmath96 in @xmath97 direction .",
    "however , the torque is opposite at @xmath39 , so the net torque is zero .",
    "let us estimate the critical magnetic field @xmath1 where the fermi circles almost detach , i.e. , where @xmath76 .",

    "an intriguing strong negative magnetoresistance effect was reported for the sn - doped films of bi@xmath2te@xmath3 in ref .",
    "@xcite . a weak in - plane magnetic field less than 1",
    "t causes a large drop of the out - of - plane resistance @xmath103 as shown in fig .",
