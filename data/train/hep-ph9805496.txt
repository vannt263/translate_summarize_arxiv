    "[ total ] , the term in brackets in ( [ diffractive ] ) is identified as the @xmath14 total cross section , @xmath18 where we have used @xmath19 , since it was found experimentally that @xmath12 is independent of @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the remaining factor in ( [ diffractive ] ) , namely @xmath21 where @xmath22 , is interpreted as the  pomeron flux \" .",
    "thus , @xmath4 diffraction dissociation can be viewed as a process in which pomerons emitted by one of the protons interact with the other proton  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath23 represents the proton form factor , which is obtained from elastic scattering . at small @xmath20 , @xmath24  @xcite",
    "however , this simple exponential expression underestimates the cross section at large @xmath20 .",

    ", the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath34 violates the unitarity based froissart bound , which states that the total cross section can not rise faster than @xmath35 .",
    "unitarity is also violated by the @xmath36-dependence of the ratio @xmath37 , which eventually exceeds the black disc bound of one half ( @xmath38 ) , as well as by the @xmath36-dependence of the integrated diffractive cross section , which increases with @xmath36 as @xmath39 and therefore grows faster than the total cross section .",
    "for both the elastic and total cross sections , unitarization can be achieved by eikonalizing the elastic amplitude  @xcite , which takes into account rescattering effects .",
    "attempts to introduce rescattering in the diffractive amplitude by including cuts  @xcite or by eikonalization  @xcite have met with moderate success . through such efforts ,",
    "however , it has become clear that these  shadowing effects \" or ",
    "screening corrections \" affect mainly the normalization of the diffractive amplitude , leaving the form of the @xmath40 dependence almost unchanged .",
    "this feature is clearly present in the data , as demonstrated by the cdf collaboration  @xcite in comparing their measured diffractive differential @xmath41 cross sections at @xmath42546 and 1800 gev with @xmath4 cross sections at @xmath43 gev .    motivated by these theoretical results and by the trend observed in the data , a phenomenological approach to unitarization of the diffractive amplitude",
    "was proposed  @xcite based on  renormalizing \" the pomeron flux by requiring its integral over all @xmath44 and @xmath20 to saturate at unity .",
    "such a renormalization , which corresponds to _ a maximum _ of one pomeron per proton , leads to interpreting the pomeron flux as a probability density simply describing the @xmath44 and @xmath20 distributions of the exchanged pomeron in a diffractive process ( see details in section 3 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the hypothesis of flux renormalization provides a good description not only of the s - dependence of the total integrated sd cross section , as was already shown in  @xcite , but also of the differential @xmath40 ( or @xmath44 ) and @xmath20 distributions .",
    "specifically , we show that for @xmath45 gev@xmath17 ( above the resonance region ) and @xmath46 ( the coherence region  @xcite ) , all available data for @xmath47 at small @xmath20 can be described by a renormalized triple - pomeron exchange amplitude , plus a non - diffractive contribution from a  reggeized \" pion exchange amplitude , whose normalization is fixed at the value determined from charge exchange experiments , @xmath48 .",
    "a good fit to the data is obtained using only _ one free parameter _ ,",
    "namely the triple - pomeron coupling , @xmath49 .    we also show that the @xmath0 cross section at small @xmath44 displays a striking scaling behavior , namely @xmath50 , where the coefficient @xmath51 is @xmath36-independent over six orders of magnitude .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath39 dependence expected from the standard triple - pomeron amplitude represents an increase of a factor of @xmath52 between @xmath53 and 1800 gev .",
    "this scaling behavior is predicted by the renormalized flux hypothesis and provides a stringent and successful test of its validity .",
    "in section 2 we present and discuss the data we use in this paper ; in section 3 we describe our phenomenological approach in fitting the data using the pomeron flux renormalization and pion exchange models ; in section 4 we present the results of our fits to data ; in section 5 we present the case for a scaling law in diffraction ; and in section 6 we make some concluding remarks on factorization and scaling in soft diffraction .",

    "the factor of @xmath65 does not appear in reference  @xcite and is introduced here to account for the fact that we refer to the cross section for @xmath56 and do not include that for @xmath66 , as was done by cdf .",

    "1a and 1b was converted to an absolute cross section by convoluting the analytic cdf formula for the differential cross section with the @xmath20-acceptance function and with the gaussian @xmath44-resolution function using a normalization that reproduces the mc histogram .",

    "thus , once the detector experimental resolution is accounted for , the low @xmath44 ( or equivalently , the low @xmath76 ) cross section is _ completely compatible _ with that expected from extrapolating the cross section from the region of @xmath77 @xmath78 into the resolution dominated very low-@xmath44 region using the triple - pomeron differential cross section",

    "the data lie higher than the extrapolation of the solid - line fits from the larger @xmath44-values ( see figs .",
    "this effect is completely accounted for by the smearing effect of the @xmath44-resolution , which also accounts for the values of the cross sections in the unphysical negative @xmath44-regions , as seen in figs .",

    "we now return to the question of the slopes @xmath86 of the @xmath20-distributions ( see table  1 ) .",

    "the 1800 gev value is close to 4.6 , within error , but the 546 gev slope is significantly larger than 4.6 gev@xmath31 .",
    "the discrepancy between the slope value measured by cdf at @xmath91 gev and the expected value of @xmath92 gev@xmath31 may be explained by the very short @xmath20-range of the experimental measurement . in the region of low @xmath44 , where pomeron exchange is dominant ,",
    "the detector had reasonable acceptance only within the region @xmath93 gev@xmath17 .",
    "thus , the slope could not be measured accurately .",
    "the quoted error in the measured slope is the standard deviation calculated keeping all other parameters fixed at their best - fit values .",
    "the large correlation coefficients  @xcite between the error of the cdf best - fit parameter @xmath86 and other fit parameters indicate that a good fit to the data within the @xmath20-region of the measurement could have been obtained with a different value of @xmath86 , and correspondingly different value of the other parameters , subject to the constraint that the integrated cross section over the @xmath20-range of the measurement remain the same .",
    "since @xmath79 gev@xmath17 corresponds approximately to the cross - section - weighted mean value of @xmath20 in the region @xmath94 , the value of the differential cross sections at @xmath79 gev@xmath17 is insensitive to a change in @xmath86 .      at @xmath42546 ( 1800 )",

    "the renormalization of the triple - pomeron amplitude consists in dividing the pomeron flux of the standard regge - theory amplitude by its integral over all available phase space in @xmath44 and @xmath20 .",
    "such a division provides an unambiguous normalization of the pomeron flux , since the energy scale factor , @xmath16 , which is implicit in the definition of the pomeron proton coupling @xmath247 that determines the normalization for the standard flux , drops out .",
    "thus , the renormalized pomeron flux depends _ only _ on the value of @xmath248 and on the pomeron trajectory , which is obtained from fits to elastic and total cross sections .",

    "the scaling of the pomeron flux to its integral represents a scaling law in diffraction , which unitarizes the diffractive amplitude at the expense of factorization .",
    "a spectacular graphical representation of this scaling is provided by the experimental differential @xmath250 distribution as a function of @xmath114 for energies from @xmath206=14 to 1800 gev .",
    "this distribution shows a clear @xmath251 behavior , which is independent of @xmath36 over six orders of magnitude , in agreement with expectations from the flux renormalization hypothesis and contrary to the @xmath187 behavior expected from the standard theory based on factorization .",
