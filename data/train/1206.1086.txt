    "as the core of a massive star collapses , electron capture ( ec ) on protons ( free or within nuclei ) reduces the electron fraction , @xmath1 , and releases neutrinos that stream from the core . at densities near @xmath2 , the mean - free path for neutrinos of mean energy becomes comparable to the size of the core and the neutrinos become `` trapped . ''",
    "the trapping of neutrinos effectively halts the deleptonization ( reduction of @xmath1 ) of the core as the emission of neutrinos through ec is balanced by reabsorption of the neutrinos on neutrons ( either free or within nuclei ) .",
    "neutrino opacity regulates the deleptonization and sets the minimum core @xmath3 ( @xmath1 plus the neutrino fraction , @xmath4 ) , which controls the size of the homologous inner core , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when the density in the core exceeds nuclear density , the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) stiffens , and a bounce shock forms at the sonic point that defines the edge of the homologous core .",
    "the expanding shock loses energy to neutrino emission and nuclear dissociation and stalls .",
    "the neutrino weak interactions ( emission , absorption , and scattering ) regulate energy loss by the prompt shock to neutrino radiation and thus affect the stalling of the shock .",
    "the revival of the stalled shock by neutrino heating is likewise regulated by the neutrino opacities . as for photons in stellar atmospheres",
    ", we can define `` neutrinospheres , '' where the neutrinos of each species and energy effectively decouple from the matter in the stellar core .",
    "the neutrinosphere radii , @xmath6 , are dependent on both flavor and energy with @xmath7 larger than @xmath8 because of the increased number of weak interaction channels for @xmath9  ( neutral and charged current ) .",
    "the neutrinosphere radii increase with increasing neutrino energy due to the larger opacities for higher energy neutrinos .",
    "the emission temperatures at the various neutrinospheres effectively set the flux of neutrinos in each energy  species group and therefore the spectrum of neutrinos available for absorption in the semi - transparent heating , or `` gain , '' region between the proto - neutron star and the shock .",
    "non - isoenergetic scattering ( nis ) changes the energy and direction of the neutrinos , each of which plays an important role in all phases of the supernova evolution .",
    "scattering to a lower energy can change the neutrino s environment from opaque to semi - transparent and allow a neutrino that would otherwise be trapped to escape , both increasing the luminosity of neutrinos available for absorption in the gain region above the core and enhancing lepton escape from the core .",
    "the earliest models of neutrino heating in core - collapse supernovae by @xcite included only emission by electron capture and redeposited half of the energy lost to core neutrino emission in the layers above the proto - neutron star , driving a powerful explosion of the outer layers of the star .",
    "subsequent spherically symmetric models included more detailed treatment of neutrino transport to revive the shock : gray diffusion @xcite , two - fluid schemes @xcite , multi - group flux - limited diffusion @xcite , and boltzmann transport @xcite .",

    "we retain at minimum the b85-formulation of scattering on nucleons and nuclei and emission and absorption on nucleons and nuclei to ensure that the total opacity is not radically changed .",
    "while the differences found among the tests of opacity removal are generally consistent with prior single - opacity studies , we find that opacity changes in the context of a detailed opacity set can have different impacts than changing the same opacity in a less complete opacity set .",

    "we see a different behavior , with nes being the more important nis opacity .",
    "the breakout burst @xmath52 is approximately 480  @xmath45  for models without nes ( base - nones , base - nonis ) and approximately 405  @xmath45  for models with nes ( base , base - isnp ) .",
    "the same grouping applies for @xmath50 , which is up to 2  higher during breakout and up to 1  higher before bounce for models without nes .",
    "the breakout burst represents the passage of the shock through the neutrinospheres , and the material above the shock is primarily composed of heavy nuclei .",
    "therefore , scattering on free nucleons is of less importance to the neutrino spectrum during breakout .",
    "the electrons above the shock downscatter the energies of the escaping neutrinos and lower the @xmath50  and , therefore , the total luminosity .",
    "the most dramatic difference seen in these models is in the quantity @xmath53  ( figure  [ fig : baseavgen ] , dashed lines ) , with significant differences across all the models . at 150  ms post - bounce the increase in @xmath53 relative to the base  model is approximately 0.5 and 1.5  , respectively , for models base - nones  and base - isnp , while the increase is nearly 7  for model base - nonis , with all nis scatterings removed .",
    "this demonstrates the non - linear nature of the opacity changes .",
    "energy lost by @xmath38  via scattering thermalizes the spectra of @xmath38  reducing @xmath53 and serves as an important source of heating between the @xmath38- and @xmath9-neutrinospheres .",
    "( see section  [ sec : pair ] for further discussion . ) in model base - nonis  there are no scattering processes remaining to thermalize the spectrum of @xmath38  after emission .",
    "nis from either nucleons or electrons is enough to significantly lower @xmath53 , with both required for the full effect .",
    "the lack of variation in @xmath54 after breakout for these models demonstrates that absorption followed by emission plays the role of an `` effective downscattering '' in thermalizing the neutrino spectra .",
    "the lack of effects at bounce from reduced nis opacities stands in contrast to the results of @xcite who used an earlier version of our code with the same nes opacity .",
    "therefore , we repeated our nis subtraction experiments with the lmsh ec table replaced by the ipa ec of @xcite that @xcite used .",

    "the spectra for the ipa ec models ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , orange lines ) are consistent with previously reported collapse - phase spectra @xcite .    in the independent particle approximation ,",
    "nuclear ec is completely shut - off when the mean neutron number @xmath71 , which occurs at densities above @xmath72 , constituting much of the core collapse .",
    "therefore , in the ipa ec models ( ipa , ipa - nonis ) all of the @xmath9  emission in regions with density exceeding @xmath72 arises from electron capture on free protons , which are relatively rare , and results in a slower overall rate of @xmath9  emission and core deleptonization .",
    "( pair emission is correspondingly low during collapse as we shall discuss in section  [ sec : pair ] . )",
    "the lmsh ec implementation emits neutrinos with a lower mean energy than the capture on protons , which dominates the total capture rate in the ipa models at densities above @xmath72 , and fills the low energy spectra which is underpopulated by ec on protons @xcite , which we can see by comparing the spectral evolution of the models without nis opacities for the lmsh ec ( base - nonis ) and ipa ec ( ipa - nonis ) . with ipa ec , the low - energy spectrum",
    "can only be filled by energy downscattering by nis opacities , which efficiently fill the low - energy spectrum for model ipa .",
    "using the lmsh ec fills the low - energy @xmath9  spectrum directly without energy downscattering ( model base - nonis ) , so we do not see an enhancement in neutrino escape through the less opaque neutrino `` window '' at lower energies when nis opacities are included , like we do for the ipa ec models .    scattering on nuclei is the dominant contributor to total opacity during collapse and identical in all of our models .",
    "once the low - energy phase space is filled , deleptonization is controlled by the total opacity , and thus there are no discernible differences in the deleptonization among the lmsh ec models presented in section  [ sec : basenis ] . for the ipa ec models presented in section  [ sec : ipanis ] ,",
    "changes to the filling of the low - energy phase space , do affect the net escape after trapping begins .",
    "the differences between the models with the full set of nis opacities ( base , ipa ) are a consequence of differences in ec before trapping occurs @xcite .    after considering the effects of compression due to variation in central density on the temperature and the change in entropy profiles due changes in @xmath55  among the models plotted in figure  [ fig : bounce ] , there is likely an additional small increase in temperature and entropy inside the shock for models that include ipa ec and nes ( orange lines ) .",
    "this small thermal increase is likely due to energy gained by the fluid from the scattering of @xmath9  by electrons as can be seen in difference between the model ipa  and model ipa - nonis  spectra in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the lack of similar effects on the entropy and temperature by changes in scattering on models using the lmsh ec , suggests ( as does the lack of impact on the spectra during collapse ) that the nis has very little impact on @xmath9  during collapse when utilizing the more complete lmsh ec implementation .      to test the two sources of @xmath9  ( @xmath46 ) emission via electron ( positron ) capture and the inverse neutrino absorption in the modern opacity set of model base , we replaced them with their @xcite equivalents for ec on nuclei ( model ipa ) and ec on free nucleons ( model base - b85ea - np ) . at bounce",
    "( figure  [ fig : bounce ] ) , the change in nucleon ec produces no discernible difference between models base  and base - b85ea - np , but changing the nuclear ec produces the largest differences at bounce of any single opacity replacement tested in this paper . as noted by @xcite , the ipa ec ( model ipa ) results in less deleptonization , as the ipa turns off completely where the heavy nuclei have neutron numbers @xmath73 , of the inner core relative to using the lmsh ec ( model base ) leading to higher @xmath1 , @xmath3 , density , pressure , and temperature inside the bounce shock .",
    "the ipa ec also results in higher deleptonization and stronger collapse _ outside _ the bounce shock , which can be seen in the lower @xmath1 , higher density , and higher infall velocities for model ipa  outside the bounce shock ( figure  [ fig : bounce ] ) where the stronger ipa for low density does not shut off .",
    "this will increase the ram pressure as the shock passes through the fe - core .",
    "the shock forms at 0.554  @xmath36  in model ipa  and 0.430  @xmath36  in model base , and the shallower shock launch results in a more vigorous launch of the shock for model ipa  ( figure  [ fig : abemshock ] ) .",
    "approximately 70  ms after bounce the shock trajectories of the two nuclear ec models cross ( as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to higher ram pressure from higher density and infall velocities in the outer core of model ipa  induced by stronger deleptonization .",
    "the shock trajectories of models base  and ipa  cross again late in our simulations , with the net effect that the shock position of model ipa  is flatter during the epoch when we should expect multidimensional effects to become important . in the model using the b85 nucleon ec ( base - b85ea - np ) , the shock radius trails that in the base  model slightly , with the deficit reaching 5  km by the end of our simulations at 150  ms post - bounce .",
    "this deficit in shock radius for model base - b85ea - np  is reflected in an @xmath74 lower @xmath9- and @xmath46-luminosity during the accretion phase relative to model base , with a small ( 15  @xmath45 ) decrease in the breakout @xmath9-luminosity .",
    "the shallower bounce shock of model ipa  also results in a breakout @xmath9-luminosity burst that peaks sooner and higher ( by @xmath75 ) than the lmsh ec model ( base ) , and then drops sooner creating a narrower breakout peak .",
    "model ipa  shows a higher @xmath38-luminosity from bounce to approximately 80  ms post - bounce . with no discernible differences in @xmath53  outside the narrow peak during breakout ( figure  [ fig : abemavgen ] ) , the higher luminosity of model base - b85ea - np  implies it is emitting more @xmath38@xmath39-pairs than the other models .",
    "the @xmath59  for all models is essentially identical for each neutrino species during the accretion epoch , with sharper and narrower peaks for model ipa  during breakout , owing to the shallower and rapidly moving shock . before bounce ,",
    "model ipa  shows a 12  higher @xmath50 , reflecting the shift of the high - energy tail seen in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] and discussed in section  [ sec : ecnis ] .      to test the effect of pair opacities on the supernova models , we compare the base  model to models omitting @xmath0 annihilation ( base - noeppair ) , bremsstrahlung ( base - nobrems ) , and both ( base - nopair ) pair sources . without any pair sources model",
    "base - nopair  also lacks @xmath38@xmath39 . at bounce",
    "there are no distinguishable differences among these models , which is consistent with the lack of thermal @xmath0 pairs to annihilate and free nucleons for bremsstrahlung .",
    "the shock trajectories for the models with missing pair opacities begin to deviate from model base  approximately 40  ms after bounce ( figure  [ fig : pairshock ] ) , with the model base - noeppair  shock extending to 183  km , the model base - nobrems  shock extending to 163  km , and the model base - nopair   shock extending to 185  km .",
    "these are the only models in this paper that exceed the maximum shock extent of the base  model at 161  km .",
    "( see table  [ tab : models ] . )",
    "comparison of these models shows that @xmath0 annihilation is much more important to the shock propagation than bremsstrahlung .    unlike the previous comparisons , where accretion - phase shock differences are correlated with @xmath9- and @xmath46-luminosities , the luminosities ( figure  [ fig : pairlumin ] ) for these models are _ anti - correlated _ with the shock radii .",

    "the only source of @xmath9  is electron capture on protons and of @xmath46  is positron capture on neutrons . as in the case of the ec  nis interplay ( section  [ sec : ecnis ] ) , the non - linearity of pair opacity effects on the emission of @xmath9@xmath46  is clear . for both luminosity and rms energy the removal of bremsstrahlung",
    "had only a minor impact when @xmath0-annihilation was present .",
    "however , when @xmath0-annihilation was absent , the removal of bremsstrahlung had a significant impact on both .",
    "previous studies @xcite have stressed the importance of bremsstrahlung as a neutrino - pair source . @xcite",
    "plotted ( see their figures  2122 ) each opacity for all neutrino species at two energies for two post - bounce epochs within our study range and found that bremsstrahlung was the dominant pair - source _ in the proto - neutron star _ , but @xmath0 annihilation became dominant starting somewhere outside the neutrinosphere in each case .",
    "the @xmath38@xmath39  emission rates for our models are consistent with that finding , being higher in the inner core for the bremsstrahlung - including models ( base , base - noeppair ) than the model without bremsstrahlung ( base - nobrems ) .",
    "stationary transport studies @xcite have found bremsstrahlung to be more important than @xmath0 annihilation to the emitted flux and thermalization rate of @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "stationary transport studies drive toward a global equilibrium that is never reached during the dynamic shock revival phase and can overemphasize the region below the neutrinospheres where bremsstrahlung is dominant .",
    "a more relevant comparison is with the dynamic models of @xcite computed with and without bremsstrahlung like our models , though with different progenitor , base opacities , code , etc .",
    "@xcite find that the total luminosity for all heavy lepton neutrinos , @xmath76 , increases by 810  @xmath45  starting from about 30  ms after bounce onward .",
    "our models are consistent with this change , showing an increase of 2  @xmath45  for _ each _ of the four heavy lepton ( anti)neutrino species during the same epoch . the proportionate increase due to adding bremsstrahlung does appear larger for the @xcite models as their model without bremsstrahlung has roughly half the neutrino luminosity for each species as our base - nobrems  model .",
    "much of the difference can be attributed to our use of nucleon nis and gr with the rest due to other differences between the opacities , progenitors , and codes . at later epochs ,",
    "beyond the effective use of spherical models , the diffusion of core @xmath38@xmath39  to the neutrinospheres may enhance the relative contribution of bremsstrahlung to the luminosity .",
    "removing pair sources reduces cooling by @xmath38@xmath39  emission during the accretion phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : pairheat ] shows the net heating rate for models base  and base - noeppair  at 30  ms after bounce , with the net cooling for @xmath38@xmath39  emission shown as dashed lines .",
    "for the base  model , the cooling by @xmath38@xmath39  emission dominates the radiative heat budget between 25 and 40  km , with about half of the cooling returned back to the local thermal pool by nis on @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "( in both of these models the full set of nis opacities are available for thermalization during scattering . ) when @xmath0-annihilation is removed ( base - noeppair , red lines ) , both the pair cooling and related nis heating are reduced and shifted deeper into the core .",
    "the lower effective cooling by @xmath38@xmath39-pairs in model base - noeppair  results in more thermal energy being available to support the shock and a larger shock radius . emission of @xmath9@xmath46-pairs is suppressed by the largely filled @xmath9  phase space .",
    "in this paper we have systematically examined the effects of each of the updated opacities in our modernized opacity set over the initial 150  ms post - bounce , spherically symmetric phase of core - collapse supernovae . to summarize our primary findings : ( 1 ) during collapse , electron capture on heavy nuclei dominates the emission of neutrinos and the deleptonization of the core . if modern ec rates are used with a detailed nse composition , as in lmsh or @xcite , the direct emission of low - energy neutrinos obviates the need for nes to fill the low - energy portion of the neutrino spectrum .",

( 4 ) during the accretion phase , nucleon nis enhances the @xmath9@xmath46-luminosities , net heating , and drives the shock further out , enhancing the potential of shock revival by multidimensional effects .",
    "( 5 ) cooling by @xmath38@xmath39-pair emission from @xmath0-annihilation removes energy from the system that could otherwise be used to revive the shock .",
