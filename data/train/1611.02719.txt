    "high precision electroweak measurements have been used extensively to test the standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "the sm successfully describes the results of most particle and nuclear physics experiments and it is believed that any deviation from its predictions would indicate the existence of new physics .",
    "lepton universality being a key characteristics of the sm , the @xmath6 @xmath7 decay , which is the simplest leptonic decay among the @xmath8 decay channels , is therefore one of the best channels to perform such tests .",
    "any violation of lepton universality clearly indicates the existence of new physics beyond the sm . by measuring the ratio of leptonic decay widths of the charged kaon , @xmath1 , defined as",
    "@xmath9    the @xmath10 hadronic form factor cancels out and the sensitivity to new physics is greatly enhanced by the helicity suppression in @xmath11 .",
    "the sm prediction can be determined with very high precision ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , giving a value of    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a radiative correction due the internal bremsstrahlung process ( ib ) which , by definition , contributes to @xmath1 ( unlike the structure dependent process ( sd ) ) . a minimal super - symmetric ( susy )",
    "extension of the sm ( mssm ) with r - parity conservation has recently been considered as a candidate for new physics to be tested by @xmath1  @xcite . in the case of @xmath10 , in addition to the @xmath15 exchange , a charged higgs - mediated susy lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) contribution can be enhanced if accompanied by the emission of a @xmath16 neutrino .",
    "this effect can be described as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the mass of the charged higgs and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the term induced by the exchange of a bino and a slepton .",
    "taking @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev , would yield to a value of @xmath24 .",
    "it is therefore possible to reach a contribution at the percent level due to possible lfv enhancements arising in susy models . +     from ( a ) sm and ( b ) lfv susy .",
    "a charged higgs - mediated lfv susy contribution can be strongly enhanced by the emission of a @xmath16 neutrino.,width=529 ]    recent in - flight decay experiments , such as kloe  @xcite and na62  @xcite , have measured the @xmath1 ratio leading to a current world average of @xmath25 .",
    "the e36 experiment at the japan proton accelerator complex ( j - parc ) by the trek ( time reversal experiment with kaons ) collaboration aims to provide a competitive measurement of @xmath1 with different systematics .",
    "the e36 experiment , which is part of the trek program at j - parc , was set up and fully commissioned at the k1.1br kaon beam line between fall 2014 and spring 2015 .",
    "the data collection was completed by the end of 2015 using an upgraded version of the kek - ps e246 12-sector superconducting toroidal spectrometer  @xcite used in a previous t - violation experiment at kek  @xcite .",
    "the incoming @xmath4 is tagged by the fitch cherenkov counter before stopping and decaying in the active target , which consists of 256 scintillating fibers ( @xmath26  mm@xmath27 ) oriented in the direction of the beam , providing a precise kaon stop location in the transverse plane . wrapped around the fiber target is a spiral fiber tracker ( sft ) , which consists of two pairs of scintillating fiber ribbons of opposite helicity bundled together around the target , providing the longitudinal coordinate of the outgoing decay particles  @xcite .",
    "this target+sft system is surrounded by 12 time - of - flight counters ( tof1 ) and 12 aerogel  @xcite counters ( ac ) aligned with the 12 sectors of the toroidal spectrometer and forms the `` central detector '' .",
    "+ a highy segmented ( 768 crystals ) large acceptance csi(tl ) photon calorimeter barrel covering about 75% of the total solid angle is used to identify and correct for structure dependent ( sd ) background events .",
    "the calorimeter features 12 holes ( known as `` muon holes '' ) aligned with the sectors of the spectrometer allowing charged particles , such as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to be momentum analyzed by tracking with the multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) c2 , c3 and c4 . at the exit of each magnet sector ,",
    "another set of fast scintillator detectors ( ttc and tof2 ) and lead glass counters ( pgc )  @xcite provides both trigger signals and @xmath31 particle identification .",
    "three particle identification systems allow to redundantly distinguish between positrons , muons and pions .",
    "the threshold aerogel cherenkov ( ac ) counters sensitive to positrons surround the target bundle , the time - of - flight ( tof ) is measured between scintillators near the target ( tof1 ) and in each gap ( tof2 ) , and lead glass counters ( pgc ) are located at the end of each gap to identify positrons by their shower .",
    "+ the @xmath30 detection efficiency is estimated to be greater than 98% for the aerogel ( ac ) and the lead glass ( pgc ) counters and the mis - identification probability to be about 3% and 4% respectively .",
    "the typical path length between tof1 and tof2 is about 250  cm and the time of flight is determined with a resolution of 200  ps ; the time difference between @xmath30 and @xmath32 at @xmath33  mev/@xmath34 along this path being approximately 500  ps .",
    "+ figure 3 shows the particle momentum from tracking as a function of the adc pulse height for ac ( top left panel ) and for pgc ( top right panel ) .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the momentum versus the squared mass from the time - of - flight analysis . after applying threshold cuts in ac and pgc adcs ,",
    "the remaining events are shown in the bottom right panel where @xmath35 is suppressed , @xmath36 strongly reduced , and a clear separation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 events is observed .",
    "the expected @xmath11 region is circled . + it is important to note that the analysis of the e36 experiment data is at an early stage and that these results are very preliminary .",
    "refinements of the particle identification method are being implemented and further improvements are expected .",
