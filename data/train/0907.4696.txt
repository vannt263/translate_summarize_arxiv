    "the invariant mass spectrum of dielectrons measured during the 2006 rhic run , after combinatorial background subtraction ( figure [ invmass_fit ] ) reveals peaks corresponding to the , and @xmath0(1s,2s,3s ) quarkonia states .",
    "the continuum spectrum is well described by correlated heavy flavour ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and drell - yan contributions estimated using a pythia simulation @xcite , including the detector acceptance and efficiencies .",
    "the differential cross section shown in figure [ jpsi_psip ] is the first @xmath4-dependent result for an excited charmonium state at rhic .",

    "upcoming  dependent @xmath10 measurements for the forward rapidity will be important to clarify whether the s - channel cut csm describes the data at forward rapidity or not . given the current uncertainties , one can not rule out the possibility of zero polarization , as expected by the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite .",

    "the rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 cross section , adding the preliminary results released at qm06 @xcite , can be used to test production models for bottomonium and estimate the total cross section . given the smaller relativistic contributions , nrqcd calculations for @xmath0 at rhic are supposed to be more reliable than for charmonium .",
