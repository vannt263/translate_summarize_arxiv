    "in recent years , the exploration of temperature variation of the field - cooled cool - down ( fcc ) magnetization ( @xmath0 ) measurements at low fields in a variety of superconductors @xcite have revealed characteristics which have been ascribed to the phenomenon of surface superconductivity @xcite .",
    "many interesting features reported in the @xmath0 responses at different fields in a weakly - pinned single crystal of a low @xmath1 ( @xmath12k ) superconductor , ca@xmath2rh@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite , include the occurrence of anomalous paramagnetic magnetization _ a _ _ la _ paramagnetic meissner effect ( pme ) , modulations overriding pme like response , intersection of the @xmath0 curves for different field values across a field interval at a characteristic temperature @xmath13 , below the onset temperature , @xmath1 , of superconducting response , etc .",
    "investigations in the low field regime in ca@xmath2rh@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite had also revealed a concave curvature in the temperature dependence of the upper critical field line ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) near its @xmath16 , which was conjectured to reflect the persistence of superconductivity at the surface @xcite at low fields , up to third critical field @xmath17 values , which were well beyond the notional second critical fields , @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath15 values at low field were thus argued to represent the temperatures at which the superconductivity nucleated only on the surface , whereas the temperature @xmath13 was identified as the temperature below which the superconductivity permeated into the interior of the single crystal of ca@xmath2rh@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we have recently explored @xcite the vortex phase diagram in a single crystal of another low @xmath1 superconducting compound , ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 , which is isostructural to ca@xmath2rh@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the dc magnetization data ( @xmath19 ) in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite revealed a long tail surviving beyond the irreversibility field / temperature ( @xmath20/@xmath21 ) , in contrast to the anticipated linear variation of @xmath11 ( or @xmath22 ) as a function of @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) up to the end of the superconducting region .",
    "the experimental values of the upper critical field / superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath18/@xmath1 ) in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 were found to be significantly higher than those which can be ascertained following the mean field description @xcite of equilibrium magnetization in a type - ii superconductor .",
    "a field - temperature line , viz . , ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) , was drawn in the vortex phase diagram of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite , which runs parallel to the @xmath14 line .",
    "the two field - temperature lines , ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) and @xmath14 , intersect the temperature axis at @xmath25k and @xmath26k , respectively in ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 . in an attempt to comprehend the underlying physics prevailing in the region bounded between the ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) and ( @xmath18,@xmath1 ) lines in the vortex phase diagram of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4",

    "7 , ahead ] , we now present new results of dc magnetization measurements in the said region in this compound .",
    "we have observed anomalous paramagnetic signals , below @xmath1 , in the field - cooled cool - down magnetization @xmath0 measurements .",
    "these paramagnetic signals display path dependence , i.e. , at a given ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) value , one can observe multiplicity in response .",
    "the paramagnetic peaks in @xmath22 curves also imbibe modulations .",
    "the said features in @xmath0 behaviour observed in the current investigations can be ascribed to the occurrence of multi - quanta ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) vortex states at the onset of surface superconductivity and various transitions amongst multi - quanta states before the emergence of ( single quantum , @xmath10 ) abrikosov flux lines .",
    "the nature of isothermal m - h scans in the close proximity of @xmath1 lend further support to the notion of multi - quanta states in the domain of surface superconductivity in the crystal of ca@xmath2ir@xmath3sn@xmath4 under study .",
    "the single crystal specimen chosen for the present investigation is the same that was employed in ref .",
    "the direction of magnetic field was maintained parallel to the plane of the platelet shaped sample , i.e. , normal to its smallest dimension ( i.e. , thickness ) .",
    "the amplitude of vibration of the sample for the dc magnetization measurements performed using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) was kept low ( @xmath27 mm ) for most of the runs .",
    "the magnetization was recorded in the same instrument as utilized in ref .",

    "anomalous paramagnetic signals can be noticed in the @xmath0 curves for @xmath28 .",
    "the inset ( a ) illustrates @xmath0 responses at @xmath29oe , @xmath30oe and @xmath31oe in the range @xmath32k@xmath33k .",

    "figure  1 illustrates the temperature dependences of field - cooled cool - down magnetization responses , @xmath0 , for various fields ( @xmath34oe ) , as indicated .",
    "magnetization values were recorded while cooling the crystal from a temperature @xmath35 in the presence of a chosen value of applied magnetic field . considering the presence of a remnant field appearing ( when the current is set to zero ) in the superconducting magnet of the squid - vsm , we initially attempted to estimate its magnitude and polarity by a procedure described ahead .",
    "starting from a higher ( say ) positive value , we set the current in the superconducting magnet to zero .",
    "we anticipate a remnant field in the superconducting magnet , whose sign and value depend on the history of current in the magnet .",
    "we start the process of recording the magnetization data by selecting a given remnant field , whose precise value , we do not know apriori .",
    "we noticed that the @xmath0 curve in the superconducting state remained positive down to the lowest temperature for @xmath36 , which indicated that the starting remnant field was of negative polarity .",
    "we then progressively increased the applied magnetic field towards higher positive values by incrementing magnet current in small steps , and measured @xmath0 responses at each selected field value .",
    "it was found that the saturated value of the @xmath0 curves ( see the nearly temperature - independent @xmath37 values below about @xmath38k in the inset panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "1 ) crossed over to the negative side after displaying an anomalous ( paramagnetic ) positive peak , just below @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "main panel of fig .  1 )",
    ", when the set value of applied field in magnet was @xmath39oe .",
    "we thus reckoned that the initial remnant field in the magnet was near @xmath40 oe in the series of @xmath37 measurements performed , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "1 . keeping this estimate of remnant field in view , we arrived at the effective values of the magnetic field corresponding to each of the @xmath0 curves in fig .  1 .",
    "note that the @xmath0 response for @xmath29oe ( cf .",
    "inset panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "1 ) displays a usual ( i.e. , diamagnetic behaviour ) superconducting transition occurring at about @xmath41k ( i.e. , there is no apparent anomalous paramagnetic magnetization feature at @xmath29oe ) .",
    "however , on enhancing the field values from negative to positive side gradually , an anomalous positive ( i.e. , paramagnetic ) magnetization just below @xmath1 becomes apparent and such a behaviour was seen to persist for higher positive fields upto about @xmath42koe ( the magnetization curve for @xmath43koe is though not displayed in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we also checked for the presence of the anomalous ( paramagnetic ) feature if the applied field is increased to higher negative values , starting from the negative value of the remanant field of the magnet .",
    "we noted that the anomalous pme like feature was not present for large negative fields .",
    "it is emphasised that the nomenclature positive or negative for field is arbitrary ; the so called positive and negative signs of the field produced by the magnet are just the phase reversed signs . to satisfy ourselves , we repeated the record of the entire @xmath0 data by beginning the process of measurements , on obtaining remanant field of positive polarity instead of negative value in the main panel of fig .  1 .    to reiterate , after setting the current ( in the magnet ) once again to zero from the higher negative values ( instead of higher positive values as earlier ) , we recorded the @xmath0 data , which remained negative ( i.e. , diamagnetic ) for @xmath44 , and confirmed the remnant field to be of positive polarity .",
    "thereafter , we gradually incremented the field from notional zero value ( i.e. , remenant field ) to higher negative values and recorded the @xmath0 data at each field value .",
    "the @xmath0 responses now show the behavior , which is ( nearly ) a mirror image of those obtained earlier with the magnet having initial remnant field of negative polarity ( see inset panel ( b ) of fig",
    "the anomalous ( negative ) peak in @xmath0 curves can now be noticed only for the negative fields , whereas no such peak ( i.e. , paramagnetic ) feature could be observed for the positive fields . here also , the paramagnetic nature is not seen if the applied magnetic field is increased to higher positive values .",
    "it is now instructive to note that irrespective of the magnet history , the @xmath0 response initially displays a usual diamagnetic transition across the superconducting transition ( cf .",
    "@xmath0 curve for @xmath29oe in the main panel and the inset panel ( a ) of fig .  1 ,",
    "and for @xmath45 oe in the inset panel ( b ) ) for zero current in the magnet . however , gradually reversing the sign of the field , from positive to negative or _ vice - versa _ , results in the above mentioned anomalous features in @xmath0 plots .",
    "we are thus lead to surmise that there is no difference between the positive and negative fields in the context of the anomalous peak feature as it can be reproduced for both the signs of the field , by simply reversing the initial magnet condition ( i.e. , the sign of the remnant field ) .",
    "such an exercise had not been carried out while reporting similar results in ca@xmath2rh@xmath3sn@xmath4 in ref .",
    "@xcite and perhaps had led to an erroneous surmise as if the sign of earths field had some influence in determining the asymmetry between two signs of the applied field .",
    "it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of encountering the anomalous paramagnetic feature in @xmath0 curves ( fig .",
    "1 ) in some other circumstances , say , via further change(s ) in the experimental conditions .",
    "usually , the magnitude of the remnant field gets reduced significantly by reducing the current in the magnet to zero value in an oscillating mode option of the current source . following this alternative ,",
    "the magnet current was sequentially reduced to zero in an oscillating mode from a high value of positive field : @xmath46koe @xmath31koe @xmath43koe @xmath30oe ( we designate this condition of remanant field as the remanant state - a ) .",
    "we then recorded the @xmath0 responses as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) . the remnant field in the state -",
    "a was independently reckoned to be about @xmath47oe .",
    "the applied magnetic field was then increased from this remanant value to higher positive values in small steps .",
    "the paramagnetic peak in magnetization could be observed for a few field values in close proximity of the zero field , however , the peak height is substantially suppressed as compared to the corresponding values in fig .  1 .",
    "we then reversed the initial state of the magnet by setting the current such that the reduction in field in an oscillating mode goes through the sequence : @xmath48koe @xmath49koe @xmath50koe @xmath30oe ( designated as the remanant state - b ) .",
    "the remnant field was found to be @xmath51oe on this occasion .",
    "@xmath0 curves were then recorded ( cf .",
    "2(b ) ) by increasing the current from zero value to higher negative values in small steps .",
    "it is apparent that the behavior of @xmath0 curves in fig .",

    "responses at various fields with the initial condition of the magnet in ( a ) state - a ( achieved by oscillating the field and creating a small value of remnant field of negative polarity ) and ( b ) state - b ( oscillating the field and creating a small value of remnant field with positive polarity ) .",

    "2(a ) and for @xmath58oe obtained in the state - b from fig .",

    "these two curves , in the inset panel were expected to overlap , however , they showed significant differences , with a paramagnetic peak present in one case below @xmath1 .",

    "3(b ) can be seen to be different .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 at @xmath60oe obtained in the state - a also exibits undulations just below @xmath1 which is well depicted by the encircled portion of this curve in the main panel of fig .",
    "however , such large undulations are not prominently seen in the other two curves ( @xmath54(@xmath67oe , a ) and @xmath69(@xmath70oe , b ) ) in fig .",
    "the curious metastability and non - uniqueness observed in @xmath0 data ( fig .",
    "3 ) motivated us to seek information on the homogeneity of the magnetic field inside the superconducting magnet .",
    "a superconducting specimen moving in an inhomogeneous field can yield erroneous magnetization values @xcite , as the magnetization of the sample changes to counter the inhomogeneity in the field while moving .",
    "we decided to record the field profiles ( i.e. , field variation vs distance traversed on the axis of the magnet ) , using the flux gate option in squid - vsm of quantum design inc .",
    ", usa . since the said flux gate option does not operate in an environment where the field value is more than @xmath71oe , the field profiles for remnant states obtained in fig .",
    "1 could not be traced .",
    "hence , we prepared the magnet in the states a and b ( where remanant field magnitude is expected to be less than @xmath31oe ) .",
    "we recorded the field profiles ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) in these two states ( where the remnant fields are negative and positive , respectively ) as a function of distance ( @xmath72 ) from the centre of the gradiometer coil of squid - vsm .",
    "we have also plotted in the inset panel of fig .",

    "the field inhomogeneity experienced by the sample over a scan length of @xmath76 mm is found to be negligibly small ( @xmath77oe ) , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "it is important to note that we had maintained the amplitude of sample vibration to be @xmath78 mm for the curves plotted in figs .",
    "in addition , even for higher amplitudes ( @xmath79 mm ) , the maximum value of the field inhomegeneity ( @xmath73 ) is about @xmath80moe .",
    "this prompted us to record the @xmath0 curves by varying the amplitudes of vibration in a chosen fixed field ( @xmath81oe in fig .",

    "also , the magnetization response can be seen to be oscillating in the range @xmath88k@xmath87 , as apparent from fig .",
    "it is pertinent to note that the path dependence in @xmath0 ( inset panel of fig .",
    "4(b ) ) is not an attribute of the field inhomogeneity in the magnet of squid - vsm , as we have already examined in fig .",
    "4(a ) that the @xmath73 values over scan length of up to @xmath32 mm are not sufficient to change the @xmath89 values so drastically below the @xmath1 .",
