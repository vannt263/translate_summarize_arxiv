    "it is generally accepted that the chiral symmetry breaking and confining normal hadronic matter will traverse into chiral symmetry restored and deconfining hot dense quark matter ( qgp ) at high temperature or under high density .",

    "this new matter can also be created in high energy heavy ion colliders .",
    "one of the main purposes of lhc is to create qgp , probe its properties and chart the phase diagram of qcd .",
    "physicists have spent tens of years to try to plot the phase diagram from theoretical and numerical analysis .",
    "a prevalent viewpoint is that this diagram has a critical end point which connects a crossover line for higher temperature and lower chemical potential and a first order transition line for lower temperature and higher chemical potential @xcite .",
    "charting the phase diagram , testing the existence of cep and locating its position is one of the most active field in high energy physics .",
    "benefiting from the improvement of computer technology , lattice qcd has been the most important means of studying non - perturbative qcd .",
    "many works based on this tool indicate the existence and give the position of cep @xcite . but lattice qcd still can not give a convincing result because of the notorious fermion sign problem , so the calculations based on effective theories of qcd are also irreplaceable nowadays .",
    "for example , the njl model is used in many works on chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "the existence of cep is also shown and its probable position is estimated , too . but among these works , someone gives the phase diagram not completely consistent with the popular viewpoint , i. e. a two phase coexisting domain might replace the first order transition line @xcite .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) is another continuum approach , which has been proved to be a useful theoretical tool in the study related to confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the study of the chiral phase diagram with this tool is also present in recent years @xcite .",

    "the dyson - schwinger equations consist of an infinite tower of integral equations correlated with each other .",

    "there are two qualitative requirements for the effective gluon propagator in dse approach .",

    "second , this gluon propagator should lead to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the obtained quark propagator has no particle - like poles on the timelike @xmath6 axis(so that quarks are confined ) . in other words , the physical input of the effective gluon propagator must ensure that the dse has the features of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking simultaneously .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the chiral phase transition of qcd at finite temperature and density by using the rank-2 confining separable gluon propagator model in the framework of dyson - schwinger equations . </S>",
    "<S> the critical end point is located at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the first order phase transition might not end at one point , but experiences a two - phase coexisting meta - stable state . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the results in the previous literature is given .    </S>",
