    "species - area laws quantify the relation between area and the number of species found in that area and represent one of the most robust biodiversity patterns @xcite .",
    "clearly , larger areas harbor a greater number of species , but the increase occurs in a remarkably orderly way @xcite .",
    "typically , empirical species - area curves display an inverted @xmath0-shape : at small ( local ) and very large ( continental ) areas ( @xmath1 ) the number of species ( @xmath2 ) increases in a relatively steep ( nearly linear ) way with the area , while the increase is shallower at intermediate areas @xcite .",
    "whilst the two extreme regimes are relatively easy to rationalize , the intermediate one remains intriguing and has attracted much attention ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several fitting formulas have been proposed to describe collected data @xcite , among which , the most widely adopted are the logarithmic law @xmath3 @xcite and the power - law relation @xcite @xmath4 data from many field studies tend to slightly favor the power law fit ( [ eq : sar ] ) with values of the exponent @xmath5 showing a dependence on environmental variables , e.g. , the latitude @xcite .",
    "moreover , body - size seems to be an important factor in shaping sars : with some provisos on possible biases due to undersampling or taxa identification @xcite , species - area curves for microorganisms are typically shallower than those of larger organisms @xcite .",
    "different hypothesis have been put forward for the reduced spatial diversification of microorganisms ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) : enhanced dispersal rates due to large population sizes and short generation times , decreased local diversification due to low extinction rates ( owing to large population sizes ) , and to low speciation rates ( because of horizontal gene transfer and imperfect isolation ) . despite the role of the local population size in determining the mechanisms above ,",
    "the effect of its variations has not been tested ( to the best of our knowledge ) in the context of individual based models .    along with empirical studies ,",
    "theoretical efforts have been devoted to identify ecological mechanisms responsible for shaping species - area curves @xcite .",
    "examples of these mechanisms include trade - off and interspecific competition @xcite , or predator - prey dynamics @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the _ neutral theory _",
    "@xcite emphasizes the role of _ stochastic _ mechanisms such as demographic processes , able by themselves to generate nontrivial diversity patterns .",
    "in particular , neutral models incorporate processes such as colonization , dispersal , and speciation and assume , in contrast with the _ niche _ paradigm @xcite , that all individuals , regardless of the species they belong to , have the same prospects of death , reproduction , etc .",
    "_ spatially implicit _ neutral models have been shown to produce species abundance distributions ( sads ) in remarkable good agreement with empirical data @xcite .",
    "this suggests that they capture the essence of general and robust community - level properties or , at least , promotes neutral theories to suitable null - models @xcite .",
    "etienne et al.@xcite showed that sads remain unaltered when breaking hubbell s @xcite `` zero - sum assumption '' , postulating that the community size is strictly kept constant by resource saturation .",
    "then , the question arises of whether the spatial distribution of species is equally robust upon modifying other `` details '' of the underlying neutral theory ? ( see @xcite ) . if not , what are the relevant ecological mechanisms / forces that , implemented in a neutral model , are relevant for shaping the sars and thus the value of @xmath5 as .",
    "for example , what is the relevance of body - size ?",
    "_ spatially explicit _",
    "neutral models generate species - area curves very similar qualitatively and , to some extent , quantitatively , to empirical ones .",
    "they display power - law behaviors with an exponent @xmath5 in a realistic range @xcite .",
    "species - area curves in spatially explicit neutral models are mainly shaped by the interplay of dispersal limitation and speciation @xcite .",
    "in particular , for finite ranged dispersal kernels , regardless their specific form , the actual value of @xmath5 is mainly determined by the speciation rate @xcite , which is however difficult ( or impossible ) to estimate .",
    "sensitive variations of the exponent value , at fixed speciation rate , have been observed when the dispersal process couples distant locations in the ecosystem , e.g. by considering fat tailed distributions @xcite .",
    "the influence of other factors was investigated by chave et al .",
    "@xcite who mainly focused on violations of the neutral assumptions , e.g. , by introducing trade - offs .    in this paper , we study the effect of varying the number of individuals that can live at a single ecosystem site on the species - area curves generated by neutral spatial models .",
    "we consider two kinds of variations : allowing for large _ local population sizes _ , by letting each site host many individuals , as appropriate for describing communities of microorganisms connected by dispersal , and allowing for empty sites , i.e. changing the level of _ habitat saturation_.    to explore these possibilities , we present extensive simulations of the stepping stone model ( ssm ) @xcite , which incorporates variable local population size by increasing the number of allowed individuals per site , and the multispecies ( or multitype ) contact process ( mcp ) @xcite , which is suited to study non saturated habitats .",
    "these models have been not thoroughly explored before in the context of spatial neutral theory : in particular , the mcp , discussed by durrett and levin @xcite , was not , to the best of our knowledge , previously simulated .",
    "the ssm is popular in the context of population genetics but its predictions for species area laws have not been explored before . to complete the picture",
    ", we compare the species - area relationships generated by the above models with those for the multispecies voter model ( mvm ) , which is possibly the most studied spatially explicit neutral model @xcite .",
    "we remark that the term `` voter model '' is often used to denote the model with nearest - neighbor dispersal among sites . in this paper",
    ", we use the same name also when more general dispersal kernels are considered .",
    "common to all the above models is that individuals of different species are placed at the sites of a two - dimensional lattice and evolve according to basic demographic processes such as birth , death , migration , and speciation .",
    "however , important differences also exist .",
    "while the mvm and ssm describe saturated habitats with a constant density of individuals , the mcp describes fragmented systems where the density of individuals is irregular both in space and time , with the presence of gaps .",
    "the models differ also in the number of allowed individuals per site . in the mvm and",
    "mcp each site can hosts one individual at most , as appropriate to describe large organisms , such as trees . in the ssm",
    ", each site represents a local community of @xmath6 individuals , making the model more suitable to describe , e.g. , patches of microorganisms connected by migration @xcite .",
    "indeed , as discussed by fenchel and finlay @xcite , comparing larger and smaller organisms is essentially equivalent to compare organisms with smaller and with larger population sizes , respectively .",
    "for instance , it has been estimated that one gram of typical soil can host @xmath7 bacteria @xcite .",
    "we conclude that together with speciation rate and the dispersion kernel the size of the local population is an important shaping factor for neutral predictions on species spatial distributions and , hence , on sar curves . on the other hand , mild violations of habitat saturation ",
    "i.e. not as extreme as to break the space into isolated regions  have little effect on the slope of sar curves on scales larger than the typical size of the gaps .",
    "we now present the three aforementioned spatially - explicit neutral models and discuss afterward their main similarities and differences .",
    "the section is organized as follows . in the three first subsections we introduce and motivate the models that will be the subject of our study .",
    "then we discuss their similarities , differences and numerical implementation .",
    "the last subsection is devoted to a discussion of the effect of the choice of the dispersal kernel .",
    "the multispecies voter model is a spatial generalization of the infinite allele moran model used in population genetics ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "each site of a square lattice is always occupied by a single individual : the habitat is thus saturated . at each time step , a randomly chosen individual on the lattice",
    "is killed and immediately replaced : with probability @xmath8 , by a randomly chosen copy of one of the nearest neighbors ( dispersal event ) ; with probability @xmath9 , by an individual from a new species ( speciation event ) . when @xmath10 , any species will eventually go extinct ; speciation events compensate extinctions so that a dynamical equilibrium eventually sets in @xcite .      in the previous model ,",
    "each lattice site hosts a single individual , as appropriate when modeling , e.g. a forest , where each site represents the space occupied by a single tree . in such cases ,",
    "the limiting resources are indeed strongly related to space , so that it is reasonable to model competition by simply assuming that when an individual dies , a vacant site is left to be occupied by another individual .",
    "conversely , microorganisms , such as small eukaryotes or bacteria , are often present in very large numbers below a scale in which one can assume that all individuals share the same pool of resources . therefore , it is more appropriate to think of the habitat as subdivided into small patches , connected by migration and each hosting a large population of individuals that directly compete with each other @xcite .",
    "such a setting is even more relevant when the habitat is physically divided into patches , so that moving from a patch to another is more difficult than moving within a patch , like in the case of an island chain or of soil fragmented in different soil grains . @xcite .    in this perspective , the stepping stone model , originally introduced in population genetics @xcite , straightforwardly generalizes the mvm by allowing each site to host a fixed ( but arbitrary ) number , @xmath6 , of individuals . at each time",
    "step an individual is randomly selected , killed and then replaced : with probability @xmath8 by the offspring of an existing individual or , with probability @xmath9 by an individual of a new species . in the former case , the parent is chosen with probability @xmath11 among the remaining @xmath12 individuals residing at the same site and with probability @xmath13 among those at a randomly chosen nearest neighbor site . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the ssm recovers the mvm with ( as detailed in appendix s2 ) @xmath9 substituted by @xmath15 , which is the effective speciation - to - diffusion ratio in the ssm .",
    "note that , in general , as dispersal occurs every @xmath16 time steps and not at every time step as in the other models , one can show that comparison should be done equating @xmath15 ( speciation - to - migration rate ) to the value of @xmath9 used in the other models ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .      in the mvm ,",
    "gaps left by deaths are immediately filled by newborns leading to habitat saturation .",
    "this is tantamount to assuming reproduction rates infinitely larger than death rates @xcite . in the contact process",
    "@xcite , this assumption is relaxed and gaps can survive for arbitrarily large times",
    ". in particular , each individual dies at rate @xmath17 and reproduces at rate @xmath18 giving rise to a newborn at a randomly chosen neighbor site . as each site can not host more than one individual , attempted reproduction is successful only if an empty neighbor is chosen .",
    "when reproduction is successful , the newborn belongs to the parent species with probability @xmath8 and to a new species with probability @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the relevant parameters are the speciation rate @xmath9 and the birth - to - death ratio @xmath19 , controlling the fraction of occupied sites in steady state conditions . for large @xmath20 , gaps are small and infrequent : in the limit @xmath21 the mcp recovers the mvm @xcite .",
    "conversely , lowering @xmath20 results in an unsaturated habitat with larger and longer - lived gaps . finally , at @xmath22 , i.e. the cp critical point @xcite , births become too infrequent , leading to global extinction .",
    "we now discuss the main similarities and differences among the above models , as summarized in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "a key feature is the maximum number of individuals allowed at each site : @xmath23 for the mvm and the mcp , @xmath6 for the ssm .",
    "while the mvm and the ssm describe a saturated habitat , in the mcp , as sites can be empty , the habitat is not saturated . in all models ,",
    "diversification is implemented as point speciation @xcite , which of course should not be regarded as a realistic speciation mechanism but rather as an effective one @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", the speciation rate @xmath9 has to be interpreted as a normalized rate ( speciation over death rate ) .",
    "moreover , as said above , due to the different dispersal rule , in ssm the proper quantity to set up a comparison with the other two models is the speciation to migration ratio @xmath15 .",

    "one of the main advantage of this method is that numerical simulations are virtually free from boundary effect problems as if simulating a portion of an infinite landscape @xcite .",
    "details on the coalescing random walk analogy , the resulting numerical scheme and analytical estimates are discussed in appendices s1 ,",
    "s2 and s3 .",
    "unfortunately , such reformulation does not easily extend to the multitype contact process , which was simulated by means of a standard algorithm @xcite adapted to the multitype case . in this case , periodic boundary conditions have been employed and tests to minimize possible finite size effects performed .",
    "appendix s4 details the numerical scheme .    to close this section",
    ", we remind that , while in this paper we restricted our comparison to models in which competitive interactions among individuals are present , recently , odwyer and green @xcite introduced a model in which individuals do not compete ( so that species are independent ) . in this case",
    "the number of individuals per site is unrestricted ; the advantage of this simplifying assumption is that it allows for a full analytical treatment of the problem .",
    "the above models have an additional degree of freedom related to the choice of the dispersal kernel , which is , in general , important to reproduce sar curves similar to empirical ones .",
    "in particular , nearest neighbor ( nn ) kernels generate biphasic sar curves rather than triphasic ones @xcite , because the steep - growth regime at small areas can not be reproduced .",
    "to observe triphasic @xmath0-shaped sar , similar to empirical ones , requires more general ( finite - range ) dispersal kernels , acting on several sites .",
    "moreover , the resulting sar curves do not depend on the shape of the kernel but only on its range @xcite .",
    "fat - tailed dispersal kernels could also be considered to model some dispersal mechanisms found in nature , and have been found to quantitatively influence sars both in terms of the extension of the intermediate range and in terms of the exponent @xmath5 values @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we mostly explored the behavior of the species - area curves by implementing the above described models with the nearest - neighbor kernel .",
    "this choice is mainly dictated by its simplicity and by the costs of simulating the ssm with large lattices ( as necessary if more general kernels are used ) when the local population size becomes large . moreover , for the mvm , at small areas sar curves obtained with nn - kernel approximatively behave as power laws and qualitatively match the behavior of the intermediate ( power law ) regime of more general kernels @xcite .",
    "however , to test the robustness of our main findings against the kernel choice we also performed simulations by employing a finite - range square kernel : a killed individual at a given site can be replaced by any of the individuals present in a square centered at that site and having side @xmath24 .",
    "we remind that for the mvm , as soon as @xmath25 , @xmath5 does not depend on @xmath26 and the entire curve can be rescaled @xcite . for this reason tests",
    "have been performed at @xmath27 .",
    "the speciation rate @xmath9 determines most features of neutral species - area curves , in particular , the interesting power - law regime eq .",
    "( [ eq : sar ] ) @xcite . therefore , to discriminate the influence of the different ecological mechanisms incorporated in the models , we will compare species - area curves obtained by the above introduced models at equal @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath9 ( and the dispersal kernel ) are fixed , the mvm is fully specified , while the ssm and the mcp need additional parameters to be set .",
    "as previously shown , both the ssm and the mcp reduce to the mvm for @xmath14 and large birth over death rate ratio ( @xmath28 ) , respectively .",
    "hence , to stay away from this limit , we allowed for a large local community size for the ssm by choosing @xmath29 with migration probability @xmath30 ( holding @xmath31 equal to @xmath9 in the other models , as specified above ) , and considered habitat unsaturated conditions for the mcp by choosing @xmath32 , ensuring that only @xmath33 of the available sites are occupied .    to compare species - area curves generated by the three models",

    "a second and more appropriate choice is to put less weight on areas with a smaller number of individuals , where the number of observed species is statistically biased to be small . in particular , by denoting with @xmath102 the number individuals present in the area @xmath103 , we define the `` weighted average '' ( which was used in fig .  [ fig : sarcompare ] ) as @xmath104    sar curves for different values of @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp]a and [ fig : cp]b for weighted and unweighted averages , respectively . for large @xmath20 , the dependence on the averaging protocol ( if any ) is mild , while it is strong for small values of @xmath20 .",
    "the strongest effects are observed at small areas , where bare averages eq .",
    "( [ blind ] ) are influenced the most by local densities .",
    "this effect is demonstrated in the inset of fig  [ fig : cp]a , where the black line is simply the fraction @xmath105 of regions of area @xmath1 occupied by at least one individual ( of any species ) . for small areas ,",
    "the weighted average becomes very shallow without any signature of power - law behavior ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : sarcompare ] ) .",
    "conversely , the bare average almost coincides with @xmath105 , demonstrating its lack of sensitivity to the presence of more than one species at small scales . at larger scales , where @xmath106 , the two averages coincide .",
    "in contrast with weighted averages and similarly to the other models in fig .  [",
    "fig : sarcompare ] , the local slopes of bare averages display a parabolic intermediate range with a well defined minimum , from which we can extract an estimate of exponent @xmath5 .",
    "fig  [ fig : cp]b shows @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 for @xmath32 ; formula ( [ eq : fit ] ) fits well these data , yielding values of @xmath5 being larger that those for the mvm and the ssm .",
    "however , as detailed in appendix s5 , in this case the interpretations of these exponents is problematic as the power - law can be induced by the spatial fluctuations of the density of individuals rather than by species distribution .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effect of changing the level of habitat saturation and the local population size on spatial neutral models .",
    "we have shown that species - area laws quantitatively depend on these ecological features , which go beyond the previously explored variations due to long - ranged dispersal kernels @xcite .",
    "spatially explicit neutral models thus seem to be much richer in structure than spatially implicit ones , where the species - abundance distribution seems to be insensitive to implementation details . moreover , the observed variations of sars suggest that spatial neutral theories can explain part of the variability of the exponent @xmath5 observed in nature .",
    "in spatially explicit neutral models , sar curves typically display a range of scales where they are well approximated by the power law ( [ eq : sar ] ) , in particular at small scales for nn - kernels and at intermediate scales for finite range kernels .",
    "we have shown that , generally , the inverse exponent @xmath48 is very well described as a linear function of @xmath49 , the logarithm of the rate of the introduction of new species @xmath9 .",
    "the same kind of behavior was analytically confirmed in an exactly solvable neutral model @xcite .",
    "however , the coefficients of this linear relation and thus the actual value of @xmath5 are sensitive to the ecological factors implemented in the model .",
    "the logarithmic behavior is a general and robust feature related to two common features of all neutral models discussed here : species originate with one individual ( point speciation mode ) and then diffuse in space . altering the speciation mechanisms in spatially implicit models affects some aspects of sads @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting , in the future , to study how different speciation modes reflect into the spatial variation of biodiversity , a program which just started in the context of spatial models ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the context of the models considered in this paper , assuming that variations in @xmath5 are caused by @xmath9 variability among different taxa ,",
    "amounts to say that the diversification rate per capita per generation increases at increasing body mass @xcite .",
    "while this possibility can not be completely ruled out ( owing mostly to the difficulty of estimating such rates ) , organisms such as bacteria are characterized by high mutation rates and genetic plasticity , rather suggesting a higher rate of differentiation even when considered at the individual level .",
    "relaxing the hypothesis of _ habitat saturation _",
    "as occurs in the multispecies contact process does not greatly modify the behavior of species - areas curves with respect to the saturated case i.e . the multispecies voter model , unless the habitat becomes too fragmented . in the latter case ,",
    "species - area curves strongly depend on the sampling procedure .",
    "in particular , using `` weighted averages '' ( which weight to the sampled area proportionally to the population it hosts ) the contact process generates sars convex in log - log scale , with no clearly detectable power - law regime .",
    "conversely , allowing for variations in the _ local population size _",
    "as occurs in the stepping stone model leads to a monotonic decrease of the exponent @xmath5 as the number of individuals per site @xmath6 is increased . for large values of @xmath6",
    "we numerically found a reduction in the exponent @xmath5 up to a factor @xmath107 with respect to the @xmath14 , voter model , value .",
    "our analytical estimate ( [ eq : analytics ] ) suggests that this factor can be actually larger ( up to a factor @xmath108 ) when the community size @xmath6 becomes very large .",
    "this is a quite remarkable result in view of the fact that microorganisms , for which a description in terms of very large local communities is appropriate @xcite , do actually spatially structure themselves with shallow taxa - area laws @xcite characterized by smaller values of @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , a recent review @xcite reports results for salt - marsh bacteria , marine diatoms , arid soil fungi , and marine ciliates and shows that , in contiguous habitats , @xmath5-values for all these categories are roughly the half as those for larger animals and plants , in surprisingly good agreement with our results .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the reduced diversification of microorganism has been sometimes ascribed to the possibility of long distance dispersal @xcite .",
    "however , numerical results of ref.@xcite show that distant dispersal events increase rather than decrease the local slope in the intermediate regime and thus the value of the exponent @xmath5 ( while the local slope at larger scales decreases ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that large distance dispersal events can in the absence of additional mechanisms account for the observed small value of the exponents in microbial communities .    more generally , the spatial variation of biodiversity observed in the stepping stone model suggests an explanation for the observed `` cosmopolitan '' behavior of microorganisms @xcite , where relatively small areas are found to contain significant fractions of the species known in the entire globe .",
    "this phenomenon is remarkably well captured by the ssm where , upon increasing the local population size , each site tends to contain a considerable fraction of the entire biodiversity found in a large area . in conclusion ,",
    "the results obtained with the stepping stone model add mathematical support , within the neutral theory framework , to large population sizes being one of the mechanisms for the shallower sar curves observed in microorganisms ( as put forward by fenchel and finally @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the ssm shows that having a large population size , within a well mixed patch , provides a buffer to local extinctions and enhances the local fixations time , making inter - patch migration more effective and the whole ecosystem closer to a panmictic population with , consequently , a lowered spatial diversification .",
    "* appendix s1 *    * dual representation of voter and stepping stone models *    to compute sar - curves , one needs to generate several spatial configurations of the different models and average over them .",
    "generating such configurations amounts to identify , at a certain ( long ) time @xmath109 , to which species the individuals residing at each lattice site belong to .",
    "a straightforward algorithm is to evolve the system from time @xmath110 to time @xmath109 according to the dynamical rules described in the main text . for the multispecies voter model ( mvm ) and stepping stone model ( ssm ) an alternative strategy exists , that is to employ the so - called dual dynamics",
    "this idea stems from the work of liggett @xcite , who recognized the relation between the voter model without speciation ( @xmath90 ) and a system of coalescing random walkers moving backward in time , and from the coalescent theory introduced by kingman @xcite in the context of population genetics .",
    "let us start by briefly recalling the dual representation for the voter model . in the voter model",
    "an individual creates a replica of itself at a randomly chosen nearest neighbor site . in the backward picture ,",
    "the sequence of _ ancestors _ of any given individual , existing at time @xmath109 , is seen as a random walk moving backward in time on the lattice .",
    "if , at a certain time @xmath111 , two random walkers meet at a site , the corresponding two individuals have a common ancestor and thus belong to the same species .",
    "hence , for times , @xmath112 the two walkers _ coalesce _ into one . as a consequence , as time evolves backward , the number of walkers is progressively reduced .",
    "introducing a non - vanishing speciation rate , @xmath9 , corresponds to annihilating random walkers at the same rate , i.e. to terminating backward paths . in this way",
    ", the voter model with speciation or multispecies voter model ( mvm ) turns out to be _ dual _ to a system of diffusing and annihilating random walkers moving backward in time .",
    "the dual representation allows for understanding some properties of the mvm and ssm in terms of diffusive processes @xcite , and for deriving analytical predictions ( see appendix s3 ) .",
    "moreover , it suggests efficient algorithms for numerical simulations . for the mvm",
    ", details of such algorithms can be found in @xcite , while details of our own results for the dual theory of the ssm , together with a description of an efficient algorithm for computer simulations , are described in the next subsection .",
    "* appendix s2 *    * dual algorithm for the stepping stone model *    the dual process of the ssm is constructed by following the same idea as that for the mvm ( appendix s1 ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the ssm each site can host @xmath6 individuals , and reproduction events can happen either at the same site with probability @xmath113 or at a neighbor site with probability @xmath13 . in the backward picture",
    ", each site contains @xmath6 compartments , hosting at maximum one walker each .",
    "the dynamics starts by placing a walker at each compartment of a @xmath114 square - lattice , resulting in @xmath115 walkers . as for the mvm",
    ", the walkers move backward in time coalescing and annihilating .",
    "the only difference here is that coalescence occur only if the walkers end up in the same compartment within the same site .",
    "more specifically , the dual algorithm is implemented as follows . at each time step , a walker is randomly picked , and : * ( i ) * killed with probability @xmath9 .",
    "then , the number of species @xmath2 ( set to zero at the beginning ) is incremented by one unit and assigned to the dead walker , which is removed from the pool of alive walkers ( @xmath116 decreased by one ) . *",
    "( ii ) * with probability @xmath117 , the walker moves : * ( iia ) * with probability @xmath113 , it moves to a randomly chosen compartment among the other @xmath12 belonging to the same site .",
    "if it was occupied , coalescence takes place , and one of the two coalesced walkers is removed from the list of alive walkers ( @xmath116 decreased by one ) . *",
    "( iib ) * with probability @xmath13 , it moves to a randomly chosen compartment of any of the neighbor sites .",
    "if such compartment was occupied , coalescence occurs as in * ( iia * ) .",
    "each simulation ends when a single walker remains alive ( @xmath118 ) ; this is then killed as in * ( i)*. then , the stored information about the coalescing and annihilating events for each walker allows the genealogy of each individual to be reconstructed and thus we can assign a species to each individual , compartments by compartments and site by site .",
    "the mvm corresponds to @xmath119 . with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , events * ( iia ) * correspond to time steps in which walkers do not move , leading to a time rescaling with respect to the @xmath122 case .",
    "this clarifies why the effective speciation - to - diffusion ratio , @xmath123 , is the appropriate parameter to compare the ssm with the mvm .",
    "simulations based on the backward dynamics present a number of advantages . as both annihilation and coalescence events decrease the number of walkers , the computation speeds up also when @xmath9 is very small ( where the bottleneck becomes the speed of the random number generator ) .",
    "when there are many alive walkers ( i.e. at the beginning ) , the slowest operation is to search for the collision / coalescence partner * ( ii ) * ; this search is made efficient by means of a look - up table .",
    "moreover , simulations are free of finite - size boundary effects .",
    "as walkers can move in the whole plane , they effectively sample a portion of size @xmath114 of an infinite system .",
    "this means that , to explore the power - law intermediate regime of sar - curves , there is no need to consider huge systems to avoid finite - size effects , at variance with the forward dynamics ( as discussed in appendix s4 for the mcp ) .",
    "finally , there is no need to wait for a statistically steady state to establish , as is the case for the forward dynamics . in the dual representation ,",
    "each simulation generates , by construction , a statistically stationary configuration .",
    "as annihilating and coalescing events are independent , one could in principle perform simulations at @xmath90 , and perform killing ( speciation ) a posteriori by pruning the list of coalescences . in this way one could use the same realization of the coalescing random walks to increase the statistics by averaging over different speciation histories .",
    "this is a standard procedure in population genetics @xcite , and can also be implemented in this context @xcite .",
    "here we did not implemented such a procedure owing to its memory requirements for large @xmath6 values and large lattice sizes .",
    "* appendix s3 *    * estimates for @xmath5 in the mvm and the ssm *    the backward dynamics can also be used to obtain analytical estimates for @xmath5 . before deriving the new results for the ssm , we sketch the original idea developed for the mvm in refs.@xcite .",
    "the timescale for a new species to appear , i.e. the typical time for walkers to annihilate in the dual representation , is @xmath124 .",
    "walkers diffuse in space and thus after a time @xmath109 , on average , they move a distance @xmath125 from their origin .",
    "this means that , associated with @xmath126 , there is a characteristic spatial scale @xmath127 .",
    "given a sample of area @xmath128 , the number of species present in the sample @xmath129 is given by the total number of annihilated walkers , which can be estimated as follows .",
    "in a two - dimensional system of coalescing walkers , with short range dispersal and without annihilation , the density of walkers decreases asymptotically as @xcite @xmath130 the annihilation rate at time @xmath109 can be estimated as the annihilation rate per walker , @xmath9 , times the average number of walkers at time @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath131 .",
    "its time integral gives the total number of annihilations ( the distribution of annihilations is poissonian ) , so that @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the time at which the asymptotic scaling relation sets in .",
    "we assume @xmath134 and drop the dependence on @xmath133 in the above expression .",
    "moreover , the number of annihilations happening for times larger than @xmath126 is bounded and can be neglected @xcite . finally , the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ walkerarg ] ) assumes the number of annihilations being negligible compared to the number of coalescences , i.e. @xmath9 is very small .",

    "let us now discuss the ssm .",
    "in this case , two different regimes @xmath138 and @xmath139 should be distinguished . in the former ,",
    "all walkers at any given site typically coalesce intra - site before having the time to jump to neighboring sites , so that essentially no inter - site coalescences occur before all walkers at any site coalesce into just one .",
    "once this has happened , the system becomes voter - like , and one can repeat the calculation above , but with the diffusion time replaced by an effective one being @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , one retrieves the result ( [ z1 ] ) with @xmath9 replaced by the speciation to migration ratio : @xmath15 .    in the opposite limit @xmath139 ,",
    "intra - site coalescence is limited by diffusion and by the size of the local population @xmath6 ( after the initial stage , when the density of walkers has decreased , many compartments at the same site will be empty so that when two walkers land on the same site , the probability for them to coalesce is very small ) .",
    "since walkers wander for long times before coalescing , we make the simplifying assumption that all couples of walkers within an area @xmath141 have the same chance to coalesce , regardless of their initial separation . in other terms",
    ", we assume that the population living patches of size smaller than @xmath142 is well mixed .",
