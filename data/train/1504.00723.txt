    "motivated by the knill - laflamme - milburn scheme for scalable quantum computing with linear optics @xcite , in recent years the field of quantum interference and entanglement with photonic qubits has grown rapidly @xcite .",
    "small numbers of entangled photons have been generated with stimulated parametric down - conversion @xcite and used for implementing various quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "more recently , several considerable methods for revealing macroscopic entangled states are reported with linear optics , such as by combining a single photon and a coherent beam on a beam splitter @xcite , amplifying and deamplifying a two - mode single photon entangled state @xcite , and so on . for quantum entanglement of a large number of photons @xcite , however , whether its fundamental principle or experimental demonstration is still a difficult and subtle task .",
    "a cross - kerr nonlinear medium is capable of inducing an interaction between the photons @xcite , although its strength is very small for all experiments reported to date @xcite .",
    "based on these weak nonlinearities one can implement photon - number quantum nondemolition measurement @xcite , entanglement detection @xcite , quantum logic gates @xcite , and miltiphoton entanglement @xcite . since the nonlinearities are extremely weak , it seems natural to improve experimental methods so as to produce large enough nonlinear phase shifts and then follow the previous schemes without bound in the limit of weak nonlinearities .",
    "on the other hand , with current technology , it is also important to explore quantum circuit in the regime of weak nonlinearities for quantum information processing @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the exploration of photon - number entangled states using weak nonlinearities . for each photon number @xmath0 , we show a quantum circuit to evolve two - mode signal photons , ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems ( i.e. , from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) . in the regime of weak nonlinearities ,",
    "more importantly , we consider the maximal phase shift induced in the process of interaction between photons satisfying @xmath3 . moreover , in the absence of decoherence , we analyze error probability caused by the final homodyne measurement .",
    "in fock space , consider an arbitrary two - mode @xmath0-photon - number state @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are complex parameters satisfying the normalization condition @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , @xmath0-photon number state ( 1 ) includes some canonical entangled number states @xcite , such as single - photon entangled state and the noon state .",
    "theoretically , state ( 1 ) can be conditionally produced by letting @xmath0 photons pass through a beam splitter and the two spatial modes @xmath9 , @xmath5 correspond to two outputs of beam splitter . throughout the subsequent context ,",
    "let @xmath10-m$ ] with @xmath11 $ ] and we replace @xmath12 by @xmath13 for simplicity .",
    "for a given photon number @xmath0 , we next show a method to detect the states @xmath13 by using weak nonlinearities .",
    "suppose there exist @xmath0 photons traveling through two spatial modes @xmath9 and @xmath5 , namely signal modes ; and we introduce a coherent state @xmath14 in probe mode ; let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be respective phase shifts on the coherent probe beam according to the two signal modes , as shown in fig.1 . in order to avoid inducing @xmath17 in the interacting process",
    "we herein introduce a single phase gate , i.e. , @xmath18 . after an @xmath19 homodyne measurement on the probe beam plus appropriate local phase shift operation @xmath20 on one of the signal modes using classical feed - forward information , at last",
    ", the original state can be projected into one of the photon - number entangled states @xmath13 .",
    "photons traveling through two spatial modes @xmath9 and @xmath5 ( say signal modes ) .",
    "@xmath21 is a coherent state in probe mode . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respective phase shifts on the coherent probe beam with several weak cross - kerr nonlinearities .",
    "@xmath22 is a single phase gate used to evolve coherent state .",
    "@xmath20 represents a phase shift on one of the signal modes based on the classical feed - forward information.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    we now describe our method in details . for @xmath0",
    "is even , after the interaction between the photons and the action of the phase gate , the combined system @xmath23 evolves as @xmath24.\\ ] ] after the @xmath19 homodyne measurement on the probe beam @xcite , the signal photons become @xmath25 } \\}(a_{m}\\texttt{e}^{-\\texttt{i}\\phi _ { m}(x ) } |n/2+m , n/2-m\\rangle_{s_1s_2 } + b_{m}\\texttt{e}^{\\texttt{i}\\phi _ { m}(x ) } |n/2-m , n/2+m\\rangle_{s_1s_2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 \\ { { x - 2\\alpha \\cos [ m(n-1 ) \\theta ] } \\ } \\bmod 2\\pi$ ] , @xmath28 .",
    "the functions @xmath29 } \\}$ ] , @xmath30 , are respective gaussian curves with peaks located at @xmath31 $ ] and these curves correspond to the probability amplitudes associated with the outputs of the signal photons .",
    "@xmath20 are respective phase shift operations corresponding to the values of the @xmath19 homodyne measurement .",
    "the midpoints between two neighboring peaks are designated as @xmath32   + \\cos [ ( n/2-k)(n-1)\\theta ] } \\}$ ] , @xmath33 .",
    "note that with these @xmath34 midpoint values @xmath35 , one can separate results of the homodyne measurement into @xmath36 intervals and then the input state can be projected into one of the states @xmath13 up to a phase shift operation @xmath37 on one of the signal modes .",
    "clearly , for @xmath38 we observe immediately the output state @xmath39 ; for @xmath40 , we obtain the states @xmath41 ; and for @xmath42 we obtain the state @xmath43 .",
    "considering there exist small overlaps between two neighboring curves , the error probabilities are thus given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45   - \\cos [ ( n/2-k)(n-1)\\theta ] } \\ } \\approx ( n-2k-1)(n-1)^2\\alpha { \\theta ^2}$ ] are the distances of two nearby peaks .    similarly , for @xmath0 is odd , the combined system then evolves as @xmath46.\\ ] ] after the measurement on the probe beam , the signal photons become @xmath47\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times[a_{m}\\texttt{e}^{-\\texttt{i}\\phi_{(2m+1)/2}(x)}|(n+1)/2+m,(n-1)/2-m\\rangle_{s_1s_2 } + b_{m}\\texttt{e}^{\\texttt{i}\\phi _ { ( 2m+1)/2}(x)}|(n-1)/2-m,(n+1)/2+m\\rangle_{s_1s_2}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in order to simplify the notations we make use of the same expressions as the case of even @xmath0 for the functions @xmath48\\}$ ] and @xmath49 .",
    "the peaks of gaussian curves locate at @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "then , we can derive the same results of the midpoints @xmath35 between two neighboring peaks and the distances @xmath51 separated by two nearby peaks .",
    "by now , in the regime of weak kerr nonlinearities we have described the evolution of @xmath0 photon combined system .",
    "we next discuss some intriguing applications of the exploration of photon - number entangled states .",
    "in many quantum measurements for linear optical quantum computation , one should always attempt to detect the signal photons and then project them into a desired subspace . surprisingly , for a given photon number @xmath0 , the setup in our scheme can be used for these processes based on postselection and classical feed - forward ( an additional manipulation ) .",
    "so , a direct application of the present scheme leads to an entangling gate for the states @xmath52\\}$ ] , and especially , for @xmath53 it yields one of the maximally entangled number states @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that the present scheme is suitable for constructing two - qubit polarization parity gate ( see fig.2 in ref.@xcite ) , discriminating between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , nondestructively ( see fig.1 in ref.@xcite , also see fig.2 in ref.@xcite ) , and so on .",
    "another important application of the present scheme is as an analyzer for the states @xmath57 . consider a state belonging to the set of states @xmath57 in signal modes .",
    "after the evolution of a series of optical devices followed by an @xmath19 homodyne measurement on the probe beam , based on the value of the measurement one can infer immediately what the input must have been with a small error probability .",
    "then , a conditional phase shift operation on one of the modes is necessary to restore the output state to that identified .",
    "in other words , the suggested analyzer of the states @xmath57 is nondestructive and thus the unconsumed signal photons can be recycled for further use .",
    "note that the cross - kerr nonlinearities are extremely weak and the order of magnitude of them is only @xmath58 even by using electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite . in the present scheme ,",
    "let @xmath59 and then obtain @xmath60}/2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , by applying an appropriate coherent probe beam the present scheme can has a small enough error probability and then be realized in a nearly deterministic manner . given @xmath61 with @xmath62 , for example , then we have @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , let @xmath1 and mean photon numbers of coherent state @xmath64 , then the above value of error probability holds . also , when @xmath65 and letting @xmath66 we can also have the given error probability .    in summary , we show an architecture of exploration of photon - number entangled states using weak nonlinearities . also , we suggest some interesting applications of the present scheme and analyze its error probabilities .",
    "the present scheme has two remarkable advantages .",
    "first , our scheme is feasible with the current experimental technology , because there is no large phase shift ( @xmath17 with @xmath67 , for example ) in the interacting process with weak kerr nonlinearities and then the strength of the nonlinearities we required are orders of magnitude in current practice .",
    "second , by analyzing the error probability we show that our scheme works in a nearly deterministic way .",
