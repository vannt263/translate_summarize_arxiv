    "the production of heavy @xmath1 quarkonia has the potential of offering valuable insights into qcd dynamics , complementary to those given by open heavy flavor production . in both cases",
    ", the creation of the heavy quark pair requires an initial parton collision of hardness @xmath2 .",
    "most of the time the heavy quarks hadronize independently of each other and are incorporated into separate hadrons .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem exploits the conservation of probability in the hadronization process to express the total heavy quark production cross section in terms of target and projectile parton distributions and a perturbative subprocess cross section such as @xmath3 .",
    "the quarkonium cross section is a small fraction of the open flavor one and is thus not constrained by the standard qcd factorization theorems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is plausible that the initial creation of the heavy quarks is governed by the usual parton distributions and hard subprocess cross sections , with the invariant mass of the @xmath1 pair constrained to be close to threshold . before the quarkonium emerges in the final state there can , however , be further interactions which , due to the relatively low binding energy , can either `` make or break '' the bound state .",
    "quarkonium studies can thus give new information about the environment of hard production , from the creation of the heavy quark pair until its `` freeze - out '' .",
    "the quantum numbers of the quarkonium state furthermore impose restrictions on its interactions .",
    "thus states with negative charge conjugation ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) or total spin @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) require the @xmath1 pair to interact at least once after its creation via @xmath8 .",
    "despite an impressive amount of data on the production of several quarkonium states with a variety of beams and targets we still have a poor understanding of the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "thus quarkonia can not yet live up to their potential as ` thermometers ' of @xmath9 collisions , where @xmath10 , hadron or nucleus .",
    "rather , it appears that we need simultaneous studies and comparisons of several processes to gain insight into the production dynamics .",
    "we will now summarize the successes and failures of the color singlet model @xcite , which we consider as a guideline for understanding the nature of the quarkonium production dynamics .",
    "in the color singlet model ( csm ) , the @xmath1 pair is directly prepared with the proper quantum numbers in the initial hard subprocess and further interactions are assumed to be absent .",
    "the quarkonium production amplitude is then given by the overlap of the non - relativistic wave function with that of the @xmath1 pair .",
    "this model at nlo correctly predicts the normalization and momentum dependence of the @xmath4 photoproduction rate @xcite .",
    "while the absolute normalization of the csm prediction is uncertain by a factor of @xmath11 there appears to be no need for any additional production mechanism , for longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the comparison with leptoproduction data @xcite is less conclusive since only lo csm calculations exist .",
    "the csm underestimates the directly produced @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadroproduction rates by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this is true both at low @xmath14 ( fixed target ) @xcite and at high @xmath15 ( collider ) @xcite data .",
    "similar discrepancies for the @xmath16 states  @xcite indicate that the anomalous enhancement does not decrease quickly with increasing quark mass .",
    "the inelastic cross section ratio @xmath17 is similar in photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite and consistent with the value @xmath18 expected in the csm  @xcite .",
    "the ratio does not depend on @xmath19 in the projectile fragmentation region and is independent of the nuclear target size in @xmath20 collisions .",
    "the csm thus underestimates the @xmath4 and @xmath5 hadroproduction cross sections , as well as that of the @xmath7 @xcite , by similar large factors .",
    "the quantum numbers of these charmonium states require final - state gluon emission in the csm , @xmath21",
    ". this emission is not required for the @xmath22 where the csm cross section @xmath23 is only a factor @xmath24 below the hadroproduction data @xcite .    in the csm , @xmath25 photoproduction is suppressed by a power of @xmath26 compared to the @xmath27 and @xmath5 production rates .",
    "one indeed observes a smaller value of the @xmath28 ratio in photoproduction  @xcite than in hadroproduction  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of agreements and discrepancies between the csm and quarkonium data led to the comover enhancement scenario of quarkonium production  @xcite .",
    "hadroproduced @xmath1 pairs are created within a comoving color field and form @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 through gluon _ absorption _ rather than emission , enhancing the cross section relative to the csm since the pair gains rather than loses energy and momentum .",
    "the @xmath22 cross section is not as strongly influenced since no gluon needs to be absorbed or emitted .",
    "most importantly , such a mechanism is consistent with the success of the csm in photoproduction since no color fields are expected in the photon fragmentation region , @xmath29 .     in qed ; ( b ) hadroproduction of a @xmath30 pair , _ e.g. _  @xmath31 ; and ( c ) photoproduction of a @xmath30 pair , @xmath32 . the creation of a comoving color field is specific to hadroproduction , ( b).,width=226 ]    the effect of a comoving color field is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ comofield ] .",
    "light charged particles carry gauge fields which are radiated in high energy annihilations into a heavy particle pair . in @xmath33 annihilations ,",
    "the photon fields pass through each other and materialize as forward bremsstrahlung , fig .",
    "[ comofield](a ) . in @xmath0 , on the other hand , the self - interaction of the color field can also result in the creation of a gluon field at intermediate rapidities , fig .",
    "[ comofield](b ) . hadroproduced @xmath1 pairs",
    "thus find themselves surrounded by a color field .",
    "we postulate that interactions between the @xmath1 pair and this comoving field are important in quarkonium hadroproduction . in direct photoproduction",
    ", the incoming photon does not carry any color field and the @xmath1 pair is left in a field - free environment after the collision , fig .",
    "[ comofield](c ) .",
    "the proposed rescattering thus does not affect photoproduction .",
    "the importance of rescattering effects in hadroproduction as compared to photoproduction is also suggested by data on open charm production . hadroproduced @xmath34 pairs are almost uncorrelated in azimuthal angle @xcite , at odds with standard qcd descriptions .",
    "photoproduced pairs on the other hand , emerge nearly back - to - back @xcite , following the charm quarks of the underlying @xmath35 process .",
    "since the hardness of the gluons radiated in the creation process increases with quark mass , the rescattering effect persists for bottomonium . due to the short timescale of the radiation",
    "the heavy quark pair remains in a compact configuration during rescattering and overlaps with the quarkonium wave function at the origin .",
    "the successful csm result for @xmath17  @xcite is thus preserved .",
    "the @xmath1 pair may also interact with the more distant projectile spectators after it has expanded and formed quarkonium .",
    "such spectator interactions are more frequent for nuclear projectiles and can cause the breakup ( absorption ) of the bound state .",
    "this conventional mechanism of quarkonium suppression in nuclei is thus fully compatible with , but distinct from , interactions with the comoving color field .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of the ces using pqcd to calculate the interaction between the @xmath1 and the comoving field . while we find consistency with data , quantitative predictions depend on the structure of the comoving field .",
    "hence tests of the ces must rely on its generic features which we discuss below .",
    "the ces distinguishes three proper timescales in quarkonium production :    * @xmath36 , the @xmath1 pair production time ; * @xmath37 , the dglap scale over which the comoving field is created and interacts with the @xmath1 pair ; * @xmath38 , while rescattering with comoving spectators may occur .    in the following we will consider quarkonium production at @xmath39 . in quarkonium production at @xmath40 , a large @xmath41 parton is first created on a timescale @xmath42 , typically through @xmath43 .",
    "the virtual gluon then fragments , @xmath44 , in proper time @xmath45 . thus high @xmath41 quarkonium production",
    "is also based on the ces @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 pair is created in a standard parton subprocess , typically @xmath0 , at a time scale @xmath36 .",
    "this first stage is common to other theoretical approaches such as the color evaporation model ( cem )  @xcite and non - relativistic qcd  @xcite , here referred to as the color octet model ( com ) .",
    "the momentum distribution of the @xmath1 is determined by the product of projectile @xmath46 and target @xmath47 parton distributions , such as @xmath48 where @xmath49 may be a lepton , photon , hadron or nucleus .",
    "this production process is consistent with the quarkonium data .    according to pqcd the @xmath1 is dominantly produced in a color octet , @xmath50 configuration , close to threshold .",
    "such a state can obtain the quarkonium quantum numbers through a further interaction which flips a heavy quark spin and turns the pair into a color singlet .",
    "the amplitude for processes of this type are suppressed by the factor @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the momentum scale of the interaction .",
    "the various theoretical approaches differ in the scale assumed for @xmath52 .",
    "csm : here @xmath53 .",
    "thus @xmath4 production proceeds via the emission of a hard gluon in the primary process , @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath22 is produced without gluon emission , @xmath55 , through a subdominant @xmath56 color singlet production amplitude .",
    "com : the @xmath1 quantum numbers are changed via gluon emission at the bound state momentum scale @xmath57 .",
    "this corresponds to an expansion in powers of the bound state velocity @xmath58 , introducing nonperturbative matrix elements that are fit to data .",
    "cem : here @xmath59 .",
    "soft interactions are postulated to change the @xmath1 quantum numbers with probabilities that are specific for each quarkonium state but independent of kinematics , projectile and target .",
    "ces : the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 are changed in perturbative interactions with a comoving field at scale @xmath60 , as described below .",
    "the scale @xmath37 refers to the time in which collinear bremsstrahlung , the source of qcd scaling violations , is emitted in the heavy quark creation process @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath61 characterizes the effective hardness of logarithmic integrals of the type @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the factorization scale .",
    "we stress that @xmath61 is an intermediate but still perturbative scale , @xmath64 , which grows with @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 pair acquires the quarkonium quantum numbers over the perturbative timescale @xmath37 is a feature of the ces and distinguishes it from other approaches . at this time , the pair is still compact and couples to quarkonia via the bound state wavefunction at the origin or its derivative(s ) . thus no new parameters are introduced in this transition . however , the interactions of the @xmath1 pair depend on the properties of the comoving color field such as the intensity and polarization",
    ". quantitative predictions in the ces are only possible when the dependence on the comoving field is weak",
    ".    ratios of radially excited quarkonia , such as @xmath17 , are insensitive to the comoving field and are thus expected to be process - independent when absorption on spectators at later times can be ignored , see below .",
    "the fact that this ratio is observed to be roughly universal @xcite is one of the main motivations for the ces .",
    "even the measured variations of the ratio in different reactions agree with expectations , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of its systematics in elastic and inelastic photoproduction , leptoproduction and hadroproduction at low and high @xmath41 .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 is measured to be @xmath67 in pion - induced  @xcite and @xmath68 in proton - induced  @xcite reactions .",
    "the csm underestimates this ratio  @xcite as well as that of  @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "the rescattering contribution increases @xmath70 and @xmath71 , enhancing the above ratios .",
    "the quarkonium cross section can be influenced by rescattering effects in both the target and projectile fragmentation regions . for definiteness",
    ", we assume the charmonium is produced in the projectile fragmentation region , @xmath72 .    the nuclear target dependence is usually parametrized as @xmath73 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath74 and obeys feynman scaling , _ ie .",
    "_ , @xmath75 decreases with  @xmath19 rather than with the momentum fraction  @xmath76 of the target parton  @xcite .",
    "the comparison with lepton pair production in the drell - yan process shows that the @xmath4 nuclear suppression can not be attributed to shadowing of parton distributions in the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath77-dependence is thus difficult to explain in the csm , com and cem approaches .    in the feynman scaling regime",
    ", we may assume that the @xmath1 pair energy is high enough to remain compact while traversing the target .",
    "the relative transverse momentum of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 could increase as a result of rescattering in the target , thus suppressing the binding probability .",
    "however , this explanation is unlikely in view of the absence of nuclear suppression in photoproduction  @xcite .    in the ces ,",
    "the nuclear target suppression is ascribable to absorption of the comoving color field in the target nucleus .",
    "this field is emitted by a projectile parton with transverse size @xmath37 , larger than the size , @xmath80 , of the @xmath1 pair .",
    "due to lorentz time dilation , the field is emitted long before reaching the target and reinteracts with the @xmath1 long after passing the target .",
    "absorption of the comoving field in the target implies suppression of @xmath4 production in the ces . at high energies",
    ", we have @xmath81 , which explains the feynman scaling of this effect .",
    "moreover , as @xmath19 increases , less energy is available to be radiated to the gluon field which therefore becomes softer , further increasing its absorption in the target and thus the nuclear suppression .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the fact that the nuclear target suppression of the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 is found to be the same for @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "it also predicts that the suppression will be similar for @xmath7 production . on the other hand ,",
    "the nuclear target suppression should be _ reduced _ for @xmath22 since a substantial fraction is directly produced without a comoving field .",
    "a measurement of @xmath83 in the projectile fragmentation region would thus constitute an important test of the ces .    in a glauber picture of the nuclear suppression ,",
    "a relatively large value for the absorption cross section is required , @xmath84 .",
    "we interpret this value as the joint cross section of the @xmath1 pair and the comoving field , thus of order @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath61 scales with @xmath65 , we expect less nuclear absorbtion for the @xmath16 states than for the @xmath86 , as observed experimentally  @xcite .      by the time , @xmath87 fm , that the @xmath1 pair encounters comoving projectile spectators , the pair has already expanded and is distributed according to the quarkonium wave function .",
    "the spectator rescattering effects are thus independent of the quarkonium formation process .",
    "larger and more loosely bound charmonia are more easily broken up by secondary scattering .",
    "hence the @xmath25 and @xmath5 cross sections should be depleted compared to that of the @xmath4 .",
    "likewise bottomonium is generally less affected by spectator interactions than charmonium .",
    "spectator interactions at large enough @xmath19 are likely to be unimportant for hadron projectiles judging from the approximate universality of the @xmath17 ratio in photo- and hadroproduction .",
    "the lower ratio seen in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite , on the other hand , is most naturally explained by absorption on spectators .",
    "it would be important to confirm this by also measuring the ratio in @xmath88 scattering .",
    "data on quarkonium production have proved challenging for qcd models .",
    "the richness of the observed phenomena indicates that quarkonium cross sections are indeed sensitive to the environment of the hard qcd scattering .",
    "we may , however , only be able to decipher its message through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of several species of quarkonia produced with a variety of beams and targets in a range of kinematic conditions .",
    "it is thus useful to begin by asking fairly general questions about the production mechanism before fitting detailed models to data .",
    "this is the spirit of the comover enhancement scenario that we have discussed here , motivated by apparent regularities of the data and general theoretical constraints .",
