    "<S> cause nuclear spins to polarize via hyperfine interaction@xcite . in fractional qh systems near spin - polarized / unpolarized transition , the hyperfine interaction also takes part in the dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp)@xcite .    on the other hand , when electron spins are polarized , the hyperfine interaction generate an effective magnetic field for nuclear spins . as a result , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) frequency </S>",
    "<S> is shifted depending on the electron spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency shift is referred to as the knight shift . </S>",
    "<S> since the knight shift is proportional to the electron spin polarization , studies on the knight shift revealed electron spin properties in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) that had not been accessed by conventional transport measurements ; for example , finite - size skyrmions@xcite and domain structures with different spin configuration in fractional qh systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a new method for electrical polarization of nuclear spins and for detection of the knight shift will have a potential to uncover novel spin - dependent phenomena in qh systems .    in this paper , we report electrical polarization of nuclear spins and all - electric measurements of the knight shift in a breakdown regime of odd - integer quantum hall effect . when an applied electric current exceeds a critical current @xmath0 of qhe breakdown , electrons are excited to the upper landau subband with the opposite spin polarity . </S>",
    "<S> the flip of electron spin @xmath1 flops nuclear spin @xmath2 through the hyperfine interaction , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hyperfine constant . as a result , nuclear spins are polarized along the external magnetic field @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the dnp accelerates the qhe breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> since the dnp is induced in the bulk part of the 2deg in this method , the dnp can be utilized as a probe for knight shift measurements in the bulk part of qh conductor .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments were performed using a 20-@xmath12m - wide hall - bar device fabricated from a wafer of gaas / al@xmath13ga@xmath14as single heterostructure with 2deg . </S>",

    "<S> finally , the filling factor is set back to @xmath32 = 1.1 and the time evolution of @xmath20 is recorded . by repeating the above procedure with different @xmath31 , an nmr spectrum ( @xmath20-@xmath31 curve ) is obtained .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0 and 0.99 . </S>",
    "<S> the traces are shifted vertically for clarity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the above procedure at various @xmath30 between @xmath30 = 0 and 2 , and the nmr spectra of @xmath33ga are obtained as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ knightshift ] . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr frequencies are different from each other depending on @xmath30 . in the case of @xmath30 = 0 ( depletion ) , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spins are not affected by electron spins . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the nmr frequency for @xmath34 is equal to the intrinsic nmr frequency of @xmath33ga without knight shift . in the cases of @xmath30 @xmath35 0 , the nmr frequencies depend on the electron spin polarization because the nuclear spins interact with electrons in qh states of @xmath30 during rf - field application . in the nmr spectrum for @xmath30 = 0.99 , where the electron spins are fully polaried </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance dip appears at @xmath31 = 40.2067 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency gives the largest shift 14.3 khz from the nmr frequency @xmath31 = 40.2210 mhz for @xmath30 = 0 . in the spectrum for @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> = 1.98 , where both up - spin and down - spin subbands of the lowest landau level are equally occupied , the knight shift of the nmr frequency is almost zero . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the values of the knight shift are reasonable as compared with the knight shift reported in earlier works@xcite .    at intermediate filling factors </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 = 0.91 and 1.31 , the nmr spectra exhibit double - dip structures . </S>",
    "<S> the higher frequency dips appear at frequencies close to the nmr frequency for @xmath30 = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr spectra with two resonant frequencies recall the `` dispersive - line - shape spectrum '' observed in quantum hall states near @xmath26 = 0.9 and 1.1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the physical interpretation of the double - dip structure is not known yet , it suggest the coexistence of electron systems with different spin polarization . </S>"
