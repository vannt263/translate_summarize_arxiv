    "the observation of a d - wave superconducting gap in the high-@xmath6 cuprate superconductors suggests @xcite that strong correlations are responsible for their unconventional properties and superconducting behavior .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath7 model is one of the simplest effective models proposed @xcite to describe the low energy physics of these materials , @xmath8 the electrons are hopping between nearest neighbor sites of a square lattice leading to a kinetic energy term ( first term of [ htj ] ) as well as an exchange energy due to their spin interaction ( second term ) , where @xmath9 denotes the spin at site @xmath10 : @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath13 stands for a pair of nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath14 operates only in the subspace where there are no doubly occupied sites , which can be formally implemented by a gutzwiller projector ( see later ) . in the following we set @xmath15 ( unless specified otherwise ) and we adopt a generic value of @xmath16 throughout the paper . because of the particle - hole symmetry in the square lattice the sign of @xmath17 does not play any role .",
    "although this model is formulated in a very simple form , the nature of the quantum correlations makes its physics very rich , and even the ground state of the @xmath7 hamiltonian was not yet characterized for finite doping and large cluster size .",
    "however , the @xmath7 model was investigated extensively by unbiased numerical techniques @xcite as well as by mean - field @xcite and variational monte - carlo approaches @xcite .",
    "all approaches found a d - wave superconducting phase and a phase diagram which accounts for most of the experimental features of the high-@xmath6 cuprates@xcite . in the limit of vanishing doping ( half - filling ) ,",
    "such a state can be viewed as an ( insulating ) resonating valence bond ( rvb ) or _ spin liquid _ state .",
    "in fact , such a state can also be written ( after a simple gauge transformation ) as a staggered flux state ( sfp ) @xcite , i.e. can be mapped to a problem of free fermions hopping on a square lattice thread by a staggered magnetic field .    upon finite doping , although such a degeneracy breaks down , the sfp remains a competitive ( non - superconducting ) candidate with respect to the d - wave rvb superconductor @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was proposed by p.a .",
    "lee and collaborators @xcite that such a state bears many of the unconventional properties of the pseudo - gap _ normal _ phase of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "this simple mapping connecting a free fermion problem on a square lattice under magnetic field  @xcite to a correlated wave - function ( see later for details ) also enabled to construct more exotic flux states ( named as _ commensurate flux states _ ) where the fictitious flux could be uniform and commensurate with the particle density  @xcite . in this particular case",
    ", the unit - cell of the tight - binding problem is directly related to the rational value of the commensurate flux .    with",
    "an increasing number of materials and novel experimental techniques of constantly improving resolution , novel features in the global phase diagram of high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductors have emerged .",
    "one of the most striking is the observation , in some systems , of a form of local electronic ordering , especially around @xmath5 hole doping .",
    "indeed , recent scanning tunnelling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) experiments of underdoped bi@xmath18sr@xmath18cacu@xmath18o@xmath19 ( bsco ) in the pseudogap state have shown evidence of _ energy - independent _ real - space modulations of the low - energy density of states ( dos )  @xcite with a spatial period close to four lattice spacings .",
    "a similar spatial variation of the electronic states has also been observed in the pseudogap phase of ca@xmath20na@xmath21cuo@xmath18cl@xmath18 single crystals ( @xmath22 ) by similar stm / sts techniques  @xcite .",
    "although it is not clear yet whether such phenomena are either generic features or really happening in the bulk of the system , they nevertheless raise important theoretical questions about the stability of such structures in the framework of our microscopic strongly correlated models .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the stability and the properties of new inhomogeneous phases ( which may compete in certain conditions with the d - wave superconducting rvb state ) by extending the previous mean - field and variational treatments of the rvb theory .",
    "in addition , we shall also consider an extension of the simple @xmath7 model , the @xmath1 model , containing a coulomb repulsion term written as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron density ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 electrons on a @xmath27-site cluster ) .",
    "generically , we assume a screened coulomb potential : @xmath28 where we will consider two typical values @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] and where the distance @xmath31 is defined ( to minimize finite size effects ) as the",
    "_ periodized _ distance on the torus @xcite .",
    "the influence of this extra repulsive term in the competition between the d - wave rvb state and some inhomogeneous phases is quite subtle and will be discussed in the following .    to illustrate our future strategy ,",
    "let us recall in more details the simple basis of the rvb theory .",
    "it is based on a mean - field hamiltonian which is of bcs type , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant variational parameter and @xmath34 is a nearest neighbor d - wave pairing ( with opposite signs on the vertical and horizontal bonds ) and @xmath35 is the chemical potential . as a matter of fact , the bcs mean - field hamiltonian can be obtained after a mean - field decoupling of the @xmath7 model , where the decoupled exchange energy leads to the @xmath33 and @xmath34 order parameters . in this respect , we expect that the bcs wave - function is a good starting point to approximate the ground state of the @xmath7 model",
    ". however , such a wave - function obviously does not fulfill the constraint of no - doubly occupied site ( as in the @xmath7 model ) .",
    "this can be easily achieved , at least at the formal level , by applying the full gutzwiller operator  @xcite @xmath36 to the bcs wave - function @xmath37 : @xmath38 the main difficulty to deal with projected wave - functions is to treat correctly the gutzwiller projection @xmath39 .",
    "this can be done numerically using a conceptually exact variational monte carlo ( vmc ) technique  @xcite on large clusters .",
    "it has been shown that the magnetic energy of the variational rvb state at half - filling is very close to the best exact estimate for the heisenberg model .",
    "such a scheme also provides , at finite doping , a semi - quantitative understanding of the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors and of their experimental properties .",
    "novel results using a vmc technique associated to inhomogeneous wave - functions will be presented in section  [ sec : vmc ] .",
    "another route to deal with the gutzwiller projection is to use a _ renormalized mean - field ( mf ) theory _",
    "@xcite in which the kinetic and superexchange energies are renormalized by different doping - dependent factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "further mean - field treatments of the interaction term can then be accomplished in the particle - particle ( superconducting ) channel .",
    "crucial , now well established , experimental observations such as the existence of a pseudo - gap and nodal quasi - particles and the large renormalization of the drude weight are remarkably well explained by this early mf rvb theory  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this approach  @xcite will be followed in section  [ sec : mf ] to investigate inhomogeneous structures with checkerboard patterns involving a decoupling in the particle - hole channel . as ( re- ) emphasized recently by anderson and coworkers  @xcite , this general procedure , via the effective mf hamiltonian , leads to a slater determinant @xmath42 from which a correlated wave - function @xmath43 can be constructed and investigated by vmc .",
    "since the mf approach offers a reliable _ guide _ to construct translational symmetry - breaking projected variational wave - functions , we will present first the mf approach in section  [ sec : mf ] before the more involved vmc calculations in section  [ sec : vmc ] .",
    "we start first with the simplest approach where the action of the gutzwiller projector @xmath39 is approximately taken care of using a gutzwiller approximation scheme  @xcite .",
    "we generalize the mf approach of ref .  , to allow for non - uniform site and bond densities .",
    "recently , such a procedure was followed in ref .   to determine under which conditions a @xmath4 superstructure might be stable for hole doping close to @xmath5 .",
    "we extend this investigation to arbitrary small doping and other kinds of supercells .",
    "in particular , we shall also consider 45-degree tilted supercells such as @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the weakly doped antiferromagnet is described here by the renormalized @xmath7 model hamiltonian , @xmath47 where the local constraints of no doubly occupied sites are replaced by statistical gutzwiller weights @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the hole doping .",
    "a typical value of @xmath16 is assumed hereafter .",
    "decoupling in both particle - hole and ( singlet ) particle - particle channels can be considered simultaneously leading to the following mf hamiltonian , @xmath51 where the previous gutzwiller weights have been expressed in terms of local fugacities @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the local hole density @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , to allow for small non - uniform charge modulations  @xcite . the bogoliubov - de gennes",
    "self - consistency conditions are implemented as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    in principle",
    ", this mf treatment allows a description of modulated phases with _ coexisting _ superconducting order , namely supersolid phases .",
    "previous investigations  @xcite failed to stabilize such phases in the case of the _ pure _ 2d square lattice ( i.e. defect - free ) .",
    "moreover , in this section , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath59 .",
    "the case where both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are non - zero is left for a future work , where the effect of a defect , such as for instance a vortex , will be studied .    in the case of finite @xmath62 ,",
    "the on - site terms @xmath63 may vary spatially as @xmath64 , where @xmath35 is the chemical potential and @xmath65 are on - site energies which are self - consistently given by , @xmath66 in that case , a constant @xmath67 has to be added to the mf energy .",
    "note that we assume here a _ fixed _ chemical potential @xmath35 . in a recent work @xcite , additional degrees of freedom where assumed ( for @xmath68 ) implementing an unconstrained minimization with respect to the on - site fugacities .",
    "however , we believe that the energy gain is too small to be really conclusive ( certainly below the accuracy one can expect from such a simple mf approach ) .",
    "we argue that we can safely neglect the spatial variation of @xmath35 in first approximation , and this will be confirmed by the more accurate vmc calculations in section  [ sec : vmc ] .",
    "incidently , ref .   emphasizes a deep connection between the stability of checkerboard structures  @xcite and the instability of the sfp due to nesting properties of some parts of its fermi surface @xcite .      in principle , the mean - field equations could be solved in real space on large clusters allowing for arbitrary modulations of the self - consistent parameters . in practice , such a procedure is not feasible since the number of degrees of freedom involved is too large .",
    "we therefore follow a different strategy . first , we assume fixed ( square shaped ) supercells and a given symmetry within the super - cell ( typically invariance under 90-degrees rotations ) to reduce substantially the number of parameters to optimize .",
    "incidently , the assumed periodicity allows us to conveniently rewrite the meanfield equations in fourier space using a reduced brillouin zone with a very small mesh . in this way",
    ", we can converge to either an absolute or a local minimum .",
    "therefore , in a second step , the mf energies of the various solutions are compared in order to draw an overall phase diagram .",
    "unit - cell used in both the mf approach and the variational wave - function .",
    "note the existence of 6 independent bonds ( bold bonds ) , that for convenience are labelled from @xmath69 , and of 3 _ a priori _ non - equivalent sites .",
    "the center of the dashed plaquette is the center of the ( assumed ) @xmath70 symmetry .",
    "other sizes of the same type of structure are considered in the mf case , respectively : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 unit cells . ]    in previous mf calculations  @xcite , stability of an inhomogeneous solution with the @xmath4 unit - cell shown in fig .",
    "[ cell ] was found around @xmath74 .",
    "here , we investigate its stability for arbitrary doping and extend the calculation to another possible competing solution with a twice - larger ( square ) unit - cell containing 32 sites .",
    "the general solutions with different phases and/or amplitudes on the independent links will be refered to as bond - order ( bo ) phases  @xcite .",
    "motivated by experiments  @xcite , a @xmath70 symmetry of the inhomogeneous patterns around a central plaquette will again be assumed for both cases .",
    "note that such a feature greatly reduces the number of variational parameters and hence speeds up the convergence of the mf equations . starting from a central plaquette , like in fig .",
    "[ cell ] , a larger @xmath3 unit - cell ( not shown ) can easily be constructed with 10 non - equivalent bonds ( with both independent real and imaginary parts ) and _ a priori _ 6 non - equivalent sites .",
    "note that this new unit - cell is now tilted by 45 degrees .    at this point , it is important to realize that patterns with a smaller number of non - equivalent bonds or sites are in fact subsets of the more general modulated structures described above .",
    "for example , the sfp is obviously a special case of such patterns , where all the @xmath75 are equal in magnitude with a phase oriented to form staggered currents , and where all the sites are equivalent .",
    "this example clearly indicates that the actual structure obtained after full convergence of the mf equations could have _ higher _ symmetry than the one postulated in the initial configuration which assumes a random choice for all independent parameters",
    ". in particular , the equilibrium unit - cell could be smaller than the original one and contain a fraction ( @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) of it .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ meanfield_phase ] showing two phase diagrams produced by using different initial conditions , namely @xmath78 ( top ) and @xmath73 ( bottom ) unit - cells .",
    "both diagrams show consistently the emergence of the sfp at dopings around @xmath79 and a _ plaquette _ phase ( @xmath71 unit - cell with two types of bonds ) at very small doping  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a phase with a @xmath80 super - cell is obtained for a specific range of doping and @xmath62 ( see fig .  [ meanfield_phase ] on the top ) .",
    "interestingly enough , all these bo phases can be seen as _ bond - modulated sfp _ with 2 , 4 , 8 and up to 16 non - equivalent ( staggered ) plaquettes of slightly different amplitudes .",
    "this would be consistent with the sfp instability scenario  @xcite which suggests that the wavevector of the modulation should vary continuously with the doping .",
    "although this picture might hold when @xmath68 , our results show that the system prefers some peculiar spatial periodicities ( like the ones investigated here ) that definitely take place at moderate @xmath62 .     lattice ( for @xmath81 ) vs hole doping @xmath50 and repulsion @xmath62 ( in units of @xmath82 ) .",

    ", the @xmath4 checkerboard state is very competitive w.r.t .",
    "therefore , it makes it a strong candidate to be realized either in the true ground state of the model , or present as very low excited state  @xcite .",
    "in fact , considering such small energy differences , it is clear that an accurate comparison is beyond the accuracy of the mf approach .",
    "we therefore move to the _ approximation - free _ way of implementing the gutzwiller projection with the vmc technique , that allows a detailed comparison between these variational homogeneous and inhomogeneous states .",
    "motivated by the previous mean - field results we have carried out extensive variational monte carlo simulations . in this approach , the action of the gutzwiller projection operator is taken care of exactly , although one has to deal with finite clusters . in order to get rid of discontinuities in the d - wave rvb wave - function , we consider ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions along @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . as a matter of fact",

    "however , the energy was found to be minimized for all the @xmath63 equal to the same value in the range @xmath102 $ ] and for the two parameters @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , we find that strong charge ordered wave - functions are not stabilized in this model  @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the @xmath78 unit - cell where all independent variational parameters are to be determined from an energy minimization .",
    "this is motivated both by experiments  @xcite and by the previous mf results showing the particular stability of such a structure ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we also impose that the phases and amplitudes respect the @xmath70 symmetry within the unit - cell ( with respect to the center of the middle plaquette , see fig .  [ cell ] ) , reducing the numbers of independent links to @xmath103 . to avoid spurious degeneracies of the mf wave - functions related to multiple choices of the filling of the discrete k - vectors in the brillouin zone ( at the fermi surface ) , we add very small random phases and amplitudes ( @xmath104 ) on all the links in the @xmath105 unit cell .",
    "let us note that commensurate flux phase ( cfp ) are also candidate for this special @xmath5 doping .",
    "in a previous study , a subtle choice of the phases @xmath100 ( corresponding to a gauge choice in the corresponding hofstadter problem  @xcite ) was proposed @xcite , which allows to write the @xmath106 flux per plaquette wave - function within the same proposed unit - cell  @xcite and is also expected to lead to a better kinetic energy than the landau gauge ( in the landau gauge the unit - cell would be a line of @xmath107 sites ) .",
    "however , we have found that the cfp wave - functions turned out _ not _ to be competitive for our set of parameters @xmath62 , due to their quite poor kinetic energy , although they have very good coulomb and exchange energies .",
    "we argue that such cfp wave - functions would become relevant in the large coulomb and/or @xmath82 regimes ( see table  [ energies ] ) .    in order to further improve the energy",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     nevertheless , we observe that the difference in energy between the bond - order wave - function and the staggered flux phase remains very small .",
    "we show in table [ data ] the order parameters measured after the projection for the @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 wave - functions .",
    "as expected the @xmath128 and the @xmath129 wave - functions are homogenous within the unit - cell .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath130 wave - function shows significant modulations ( expected to be measurable experimentally ) of the various bond variables w.r.t their values in the homogeneous sfp . in fig .",
    "[ bo_sfp_etot ] we show the small energy difference ( see scale ) between the two wave - functions .",
    "interestingly , the difference is increasing with the strength of the potential .",
    "we notice that the two wave - functions correspond to two nearby local minima of the energy functional at zero coulomb potential ( see fig .",
    "[ barrier ] ) , which are very close in energy ( the @xmath130 wave - function is slightly lower in energy than the @xmath129 ) and are separated by a quite small energy barrier . note that in fig .",
    "[ barrier ] we consider the variational bond order parameters and not the projected quantities .    when the repulsion is switched on",
    ", the height of the energy barrier increases and the @xmath129 wave - function does not correspond anymore to the second local minima .",
    "indeed , when @xmath131 the second local energy minima _ shifts _ continuously from the point corresponding to the simple @xmath129 wave - function .",
    "the metastable wave - function lying at this second local minima is a weak bond - order ( sfp - like ) wave - function that preserves better the large kinetic energy while still being able to optimize better the coulomb energy than the homogeneous sfp .",
    "moreover , to understand better the stabilization of the bo - modulated staggered flux wave - functions w.r.t the homogeneous one , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ sfp_bo ] the difference in the respective kinetic energy , the exchange energy and the coulomb energy of the @xmath129 and @xmath130 wave - functions .",
    "we conclude that the two wave - functions , although qualitatively similar ( they both exhibit an underlying staggered flux pattern ) , bear quantitative differences : the staggered flux phase ( slightly ) better optimizes the kinetic energy whereas the bond - order wave - function ( slightly ) better optimizes the coulomb and exchange energies so that a small overall energy gain is in favor of the modulated phase .",
    "therefore , we unambiguously conclude that , generically , bond - order modulations should spontaneously appear on top of the staggered flux pattern for moderate doping .    finally , we emphasize that the bond - order wave - function is not stabilized by the coulomb repulsion alone ( like for a usual electronic wigner cristal ) exhibiting coexisting bond order and ( small ) charge density wave . moreover , the variational parameters @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ mf_hamilt ] ) are found after minimizing the projected energy to be set to equal values on every site of the unit - cell .",
    "let us also emphasize that the bond - order wave - function is not superconducting as proposed in some scenarios  @xcite . in the actual variational framework , we do not consider bond - order wave - function embedded in a sea of d - wave spin singlet pairs .    in fact",
    ", we do not expect a bulk d - wave rvb state to be stable at large coulomb repulsion ( because of its very poor coulomb energy ) nor a bulk _",
    "static _ checkerboard sfp at too small coulomb energy .",
    "however , for moderate coulomb repulsion for which the d - wave rvb remains globally stable , sizeable regions of checkerboard sfp could be easily nucleated e.g. by defects .",
    "this issue will be addressed using renormalized mf theory in a future work .",
    "an extension of our vmc study with simultaneous inhomogeneous bond - order and singlet pair order parameters ( as required to treat such a problem ) is difficult and also left for a future work .",
    "note also that low - energy _ dynamic fluctuations _ of checkerboard ( and sfp ) characters could also exist within the d - wave rvb state but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the properties of the @xmath130 staggered flux wave - function are summarized in fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] showing the real and imaginary parts of the measured hopping term @xmath132 between every nearest neighbor sites of our candidate @xmath130 wave - function .",
    "we also present the exchange term on each bonds of the lattice , and the local on - site charge density .",
    "we find that the bond - order wave - function has both ( spin - spin ) bond density wave and ( small ) charge density wave components .",
    "nonetheless , the charge modulations are very small ( the maximum charge deviation from the mean on - site charge is of the order of @xmath133 ) , and the charge density is a little bit larger in the center of the unit - cell . as expected , the @xmath129 has homogeneous hopping and exchange bonds within the unit - cell .",
    "therefore , we conclude that after projection the modulated variational wave - function differs quantitatively from the uniform one : the @xmath130 staggered flux wave - function is quite inhomogeneous ( although with a very small charge modulation ) leading to an increased magnetic energy gain while still preserving a competitive kinetic energy , a characteristic of the homogeneous @xmath129 wave - function .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we have investigated the @xmath134 model using both mean - field calculations as well as more involved variational monte - carlo calculations .",
    "both approaches have provided strong evidence that bond - order wave - functions ( of underlying staggered flux character ) are stabilized at zero and finite coulomb repulsion for doping close to @xmath5 . in particular ,",
    "variational monte - carlo calculations show that a bond modulation appears spontaneously on top of the staggered flux phase .",
    "this is in agreement with the work of wang et al .",
    "@xcite predicting an instability of staggered flux type .",
    "we have also shown that the modulated and homogeneous sfp , although nearby in parameter space , are nevertheless separated from each other by a small energy barrier .",
    "while both staggered flux wave - functions provide an optimal kinetic energy , the bond - modulated one exhibits a small extra gain of the exchange energy . on the other hand",
    ", a short range coulomb repulsion favors both staggered flux wave - function w.r.t the d - wave rvb superconductors and brings them close in energy .    finally , it would be interesting to study if the checkerboard pattern could spontaneously appear in the vicinity of a vortex in the mixed phase of the cuprates .",
    "such an issue could be addressed by studying the @xmath134 model on a square lattice extending our variational scheme to include _ simultaneously _ nearest neighbor pairing and bond modulated staggered currents .",
    "it is expected that , while the pairing is suppressed in the vicinity of the vortex , the checkerboard pattern might be variationally stabilized in this region .",
