    "it is a fact of equilibrium statistical - mechanical life that if one wishes to establish the thermodynamics of a model system it is necessary to calculate its partition function . when dealing with _",
    "nonequilibrium _ stationary states ( for example those that carry a current ) it is not obvious that the object analogous to the equilibrium partition function , namely an appropriately defined normalisation of the stationary distribution , encodes the thermodynamics in a similar way .    by now the lee - yang zeros of such a normalisation for a number of nonequilibrium steady states have been studied in the complex plane of the microscopically irreversible transition rates that define a particular model . in particular ,",
    "various one - dimensional driven diffusive systems @xcite , reaction - diffusion processes @xcite and an urn model for the separation of sand @xcite have been investigated and , in each case , the zeros approach the real axis at the appropriate transition points ( aspects of this work have been reviewed in @xcite ) . furthermore , the locus ( i.e. , impact angle ) and density of the zeros near the transition point correspond to the order of the phase transition ( defined in physical terms according to whether there is , e.g. , phase coexistence or a diverging correlation length ) in exactly the same way as for the equilibrium systems long ago considered by lee and yang @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of these various analyses is that the role of the _ equilibrium _ fugacities in the lee - yang approach is taken up by the _",
    "transition rates present in the model .",
    "the aim of this work is to explore this connection more deeply , the main result being that one can find equilibrium models with the same phase behaviour as the original nonequilibrium model , but within which the transition rates are transparently fugacities .    at a rather abstract level , this phenomenon can be understood in terms of a graph - theoretic description of the microscopic process @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "one considers a graph in which each vertex corresponds to a microscopic configuration and directed edges to the transitions permitted in an elementary timestep .",
    "a representation of the steady - state normalisation can then be shown to coincide with the generating function of spanning in - trees on this graph @xcite .",
    "explicitly , if the microscopic transition rates ( or , in a discrete - time process , transition probabilities ) are drawn from the set @xmath0 , the normalisation @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 in which @xmath3 counts the number of spanning in - trees on the graph of configurations with @xmath4 edges corresponding to a transition that occurs with rate @xmath5 .",
    "thus the rates @xmath5 act as fugacities that control the amount to which various classes of spanning in - tree contribute to the overall normalisation .",
    "one can see there is the possibility for different classes of trees to dominate the normalisation as the fugacities that weight the trees are varied .",
    "one may conjecture that such changes correspond to thermodynamic phase transitions in the microscopic model .",
    "the representation of the normalisation ( [ trees ] ) is appealing in that it is uniquely defined for any stochastic process with a single steady state and polynomial in the variables @xmath5 . in principle",
    ", this form can be obtained by summing the principal minors derived from the matrix of transition rates , wherein each summand corresponds to the steady - state weight of a particular configuration @xcite . in practice , however , evaluation of the determinants involved is intractable , and in the cases where nonequilibrium steady - state distributions have been obtained via specialised methods , one typically finds polynomials that are lower in degree than ( [ trees ] ) .",
    "we believe that in these cases , the two distributions are related by a factor common to all the configurational weights which does not develop any nonanalyticities in the thermodynamic limit . in this instance , a lee - yang analysis gives the same results independently of the form of the normalisation studied and therefore we do not worry unduly that the normalisation is generally not uniquely defined .",
    "a greater difficulty with expressions of the form ( [ trees ] ) is that the relationship between fugacities and physical observables is unclear .",
    "recently , however , brak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite elucidated the connection for the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) with open boundaries , a model that was solved exactly and independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there , the ( reduced ) normalisation of the asep was related to the partition function of an equilibrium surface model in which the two transition rates associated with the boundaries turn out to be fugacities conjugate to the densities of surface contacts with the horizontal axis from above and below .",
    "thus for this model , there is an interpretation of the normalisation from which the thermodynamics can be extracted using standard equilibrium statistical mechanical techniques .",
    "this result raises the question of whether the relationship between nonequilibrium transition rates and equilibrium fugacities extends to other nonequilibrium steady states . in this work",
    "we investigate this question by revisiting another exactly - solved variant of the asep , namely that with _ parallel _",
    "lattice updates @xcite .",
    "whereas the case with a random - sequential updating scheme , referred to above , was introduced to model the kinetics of biopolymerisation @xcite , the parallel version arises as a special case of the nagel - schreckenberg model of traffic flow @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the phase transitions in the model s steady state can be related to traffic jamming .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of the parallel - update asep along with some key results .",
    "in addition to the two boundary parameters of the random - sequential variant , there is a further quantity , @xmath6 , which relates to the degree of parallelism in the dynamics .",
    "this gives rise to a normalisation with a considerably more complicated structure than that for the random - sequential asep .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to check that the lee - yang zeros of this normalisation correctly reproduce the known phase behaviour for the model in the complex plane of the defining transition probabilities . this being the case , we move on to establish partition functions for equilibrium surfaces or , equivalently , random walks on two different lattices that have the same thermodynamic phase behaviour as the parallel - update asep ( and thence jamming in its guise as a traffic model ) . in each case",
    "the extra parameter , @xmath6 , generalises the surfaces or walks obtained for the random - sequential asep in a physically meaningful way . in one case , @xmath6 is a fugacity related to the density of horizontal segments of walks on a triangular lattice and in the other it is related to the density of peaks on the surface . in order to obtain these results",
    "we find that it is of great benefit to consider a _ grand - canonical _ ensemble in which the system size is a quantity exhibiting equilibrium fluctuations about its mean . by considering the general equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the surfaces ,",
    "we are able to gain a further insight into the robustness of the phase diagram for the asep under different microscopic updating schemes .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with parallel dynamics are as shown schematically in fig .  1 and defined as follows .",
    "particles are introduced with probability @xmath7 in each timestep at the start of a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath8 sites ( if the first site is empty ) and leave with probability @xmath9 at the other end .",
    "they can hop with probability @xmath6 one unit to the right if that space is empty ( or remain still with probability @xmath10 ) , otherwise if the space to the right is blocked they remain stationary .",
    "the update is applied to all particles simultaneously in contrast to the random sequential update scheme .",
    "nevertheless , the latter is recovered in the limit @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the size of each timestep ) if @xmath7 and @xmath9 are rescaled to remain proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "dynamics of the asep .",
    "the arrow labels indicate the probabilities with which the corresponding transitions occur ; site labels are also indicated .",
    "note that the moves are conducted in parallel . ]",
    "quantities such as the current and density correlation functions for the asep with fully parallel dynamics ( @xmath13 ) were first worked out by tilstra and ernst @xcite .",
    "although a cluster approximation was used , the results obtained were believed to be correct in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this claim was subsequently confirmed in the independent works of @xcite and @xcite which employed two different matrix product anstze @xcite to yield exact results for general @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , these calculations provide the representations of the normalisation required for the present work .",

    "a normalisation is then obtained through @xmath20 as remarked in the introduction , the weights are defined only up to an overall scale . in the calculations of @xcite , a reduced form of the full expression ( [ trees ] )",

    "the phase diagram can be extracted by considering the large @xmath8 behaviour of @xmath25 and @xmath38 , either directly or from the asymptotics of the grand - canonical generating functions . in the parallel case using the latter approach @xcite we can see that the leading singularities in ( [ thfinal ] ) come from the poles at @xmath39 , @xmath40 in the low- and high - density phases respectively , or from the square root singularity , @xmath41 in the maximal current phase .",

    "where the main features to remark upon are the second - order transition lines at @xmath7 or @xmath45 and the first - order line , depicted in bold , @xmath46 . in addition , the mean field solution is exact along the dotted locus @xmath47 .",
    "the region in which both @xmath7 and @xmath48 are greater than @xmath49 is a maximal current phase , that with @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a low - density phase , and that with @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a high - density phase .",
    "there are additional transitions within these phases in which the bulk remains the same but the boundary profiles change and these occur at @xmath7 or @xmath54 . in a similar vein",
    "the phase diagram for the random sequential updates asep shows a maximal current phase for @xmath7 and @xmath55 separated from high- and low - density phases by second order transition lines @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "there , the high- and low - density phases are separated by a first - order line @xmath58 .",
    "it has been observed that , for non - equilibrium systems , a possible equivalent of the reduced free energy might be given by @xmath59 since for parallel - update dynamics the singularities of ( [ thfinal ] ) determine the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients @xmath25 , we can see that these will simply be given by @xmath60 for random sequential updates the singularities in ( [ gcasepz ] ) give @xmath61 where @xmath62 is similarly defined as @xmath63 .",
    "it has been suggested that for the random sequential update asep and other similar non - equilibrium models the lee - yang picture of equilibrium phase transitions @xcite might still apply @xcite .",
    "the starting point of lee and yang s work was the consideration of how the non - analyticity characteristic of a phase transition appear given that the partition function is a polynomial on finite lattices or graphs .",
    "the form of the reduced free energy makes it clear that any non - analyticities are associated with zeros of the partition function when the appropriate fugacities ( e.g. @xmath64 for a spin model in field ) are extended into the complex plane . in general , for a lattice with @xmath8 sites , the partition function can be written as a polynomial in the fugacity , @xmath65 where the degree of the polynomial is proportional to @xmath8 . as the polynomial may be completely expressed in terms of its zeros , @xmath66 ,",
    "so too may the ( reduced ) finite - size free energy : @xmath67 in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath68 , the zeros move in to pinch the real axis at the transition point ( or points ) and the entire phase structure of the model is determined by their limiting locus and density . from ( [ blb ] ) , one has @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents some set of curves , or possibly regions , in the complex @xmath71-plane on which the zeros have support and @xmath72 is the density of the zeros there .",
    "the expressions for the reduced free energy for the asep allow a direct determination of the locus of partition function zeros .",
    "in general , the partition function zeros delineate the boundaries of different phases since they give the loci along which the free energy is singular , signalling a phase transition . in the lee - yang approach",
    "one considers an extension to complex parameters , so the free energy , @xmath73 , becomes a complex quantity , @xmath74 , which is the metastable free energy per unit volume in the various phases given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 characterising the free energy when phase @xmath77 is stable .",
    "the loci of zeros are then determined by demanding @xmath78 for adjacent phases @xmath79 .",
    "since we have @xmath80 for the various phases of the parallel - update asep , we can immediately see that the locus of zeros for the first - order transition will be determined by latexmath:[\\ ] ] for those values of @xmath154 and @xmath204 where the physical requirement @xmath205 holds .",
    "one can check that the inequality @xmath206 is automatically true whenever @xmath207 is satisfied .",
    "the latter condition , however , is violated when @xmath208 .",
    "then the free energy is minimised at some point on the boundary of the physical part of the @xmath209-plane .",
    "it is easily verified that this point has @xmath210 ( i.e.  total desorption of the path ) and a peak density @xmath211 one then finds that in all phases the free energy takes the form @xmath212 using these results together with the definitions ( [ wa ] ) and ( [ wb ] ) , one recovers the expressions for the asep free energy given in section  [ zeros ] .",
    "this provides explicit confirmation that the peak - weighted one - transit walk and the parallel - update asep are thermodynamically equivalent , despite the fact the grand - canonical partition function of the latter does not agree exactly with that for the asep ( [ zpeak ] ) which has additional factors in its numerator .",
    "the reason for the equivalence is that these factors describe a small , fixed number of additional excursions which contribute only to the subextensive part of the entropy , and hence become irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the lee - yang theory of partition function zeros has been shown to apply to the asep with parallel - update dynamics , correctly pinpointing the first- and second - order transition lines in the model in the complex plane of transition probabilities .",
    "this fact suggests that there is an interpretation of these transition rates as equilibrium fugacities .",
    "indeed , we were able to make the correspondence concrete by mapping the normalisation of the asep onto partition functions for equilibrium path problems .",
    "we found that for parallel updates there were several possible path transcriptions , including two types of adsorbing paths on a triangular lattice and a class of peak - weighted paths on the rotated square lattice . in all cases",
    "the appropriate scaling limit recovered the one - transit walk associated with the random sequential update asep .",
    "the benefit of finding such mappings is twofold .",
    "first one sees quite clearly why a lee - yang analysis of a nonequilibrium normalisation should be appropriate in the complex plane of transition rates or probabilities : under the mapping to an equilibrium model , one finds that they _ are _ fugacities .",
    "secondly , standard techniques from equilibrium statistical mechanics can be used to learn about the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium models .",
    "for example , we showed that the structure of the phase diagram for one - transit walks is essentially unchanged when an additional fugacity associated with the shape of the excursions is introduced . in turn , this provides an explanation as to why parallelising the dynamics of the asep does not unduly change its phase behaviour .",
    "this phenomenon can also be understood in terms of an extremal current principle for driven diffusive processes @xcite .",
    "this is suggestive that that the equilibrium walk picture explored in the present work is applicable to a wider range of processes to those studied so far .",
    "conversely , other nonequilibrium systems are known to be equivalent to equilibrium models ( such as the `` raise and peel '' interface model @xcite ) so one might expect lee - yang theory to apply to these also .",
    "meanwhile , we note that the path equivalences have also been utilised to calculate density fluctuations in the asep through a suitable interpretation of the corresponding matrix - product expressions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we focussed on equilibrium models that are _ thermodynamically equivalent _ to the asep with parallel - update dynamics . at the start of section  [ teem ] we defined this equivalence to exist when the extensive parts of the free energies ( defined for the nonequilibrium case as the logarithm of the normalisation ) coincide for the two models .",
    "in practice , this meant that the equilibrium surface models we described had partition functions that differed from the normalisation of the asep .",
    "this is reflected in , e.g. , nontrivial numerator factors in the grand - canonical normalisations ( [ ztriangle1 ] ) , ( [ ztriangle2 ] ) and ( [ zpeak ] ) .",
    "these factors did not concern us here , since we were interested only in the thermodynamic phase behaviour of the models : if one wishes to consider _ finite - sized _ systems , one should take care to include them .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that even for finite - sized systems , the loci of zeros of the normalisation obtained from an `` artificial '' grand - canonical generating function constructed from the denominator alone are similar to those obtained using the full expressions .    thus far , our analyses ( and related calculations in @xcite ) have relied on the prior existence of solutions for the nonequilibrium steady states under consideration .",
    "this is , of course , an unsatisfactory state of affairs , and ideally we would like to be able to establish the path equivalences _ directly _ from the definition of the microscopic process .",
    "we suggest , admittedly speculatively , that the extremely compact forms of the grand - canonical normalisations for the asep suggest that such an enterprise may be possible ( though no small challenge ) .",
    "in particular , such a study might yield a new way to determine nonequilibrium steady - state distributions . as a first step towards this goal",
    ", it would be of interest to investigate other nonequilibrium states for which thermodynamically equivalent equilibrium models have not yet been derived .",
    "chief among these is the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) @xcite in which particles may hop to the left as well as to the right across the lattice .",
    "when the left and right hop rates are equal , there is an additional transition to a phase in which there is a zero current in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if one could understand this transition from an equilibrium statistical mechanical point of view , it would give further weight to the growing evidence that phase transitions in equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states are two sides of same coin .",
