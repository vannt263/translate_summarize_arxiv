    "the charge exchange ( cx ) process may be a large contributor to the x - ray emission of many astrophysical environments such as comets , supernova remnants , the heliosphere , astrospheres of stars , and generally , highly ionized regions of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in modeling cx emission ,",
    "the availability of atomic data for charge exchange is often insufficient thus hindering the completeness and validity of present models .",
    "therefore , working at the interface of atomic and molecular physics with astrophysics , we have applied quantum defect methods , the landau - zener theory of charge exchange , and a cascade model for x - ray emission to show that not only can charge exchange calculations be performed , but that they must be considered in the x - ray spectroscopy of many astrophysical environments .",
    "+ charge exchange collisions occur when a projectile ion captures an electron from a target neutral species . in this work",
    ", we consider only single electron capture ( sec ) .",
    "this process is given generally by equation ( 1 ) where @xmath7 denotes the projectile ion with charge @xmath8 and @xmath9 denotes the target species , @xmath10 while @xmath0 and @xmath6 are the principal and orbital angular momentum of the captured electron , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the total spin and total orbital electron angular momenta of the product ion .",
    "the multi - channel landau - zener ( mclz ) approach is applied to generate @xmath0-resolved , @xmath1-resolved , and total cross sections for charge exchange .",
    "the mclz level of theory is not the most advanced framework as compared to other methods such as quantum - mechanical molecular - orbital close - coupling ( qmocc ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the power of mclz calculations can be seen in its quick computation time relative to other techniques and the implications and quick resolution that such a tool could bring to the current lack of atomic and molecular data necessary for the astrophysical modeling for many systems . here",
    ", we also validate our theoretical spectra for fe xxv and fe xxvi with molecular nitrogen charge exchange collisions by comparison to experimental spectra given in @xcite .",
    "atomic units are used throughout , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the foundation for the multi - channel landau - zener theory begins by examining the initial and final channels of the collision system .",
    "the initial channel is characterized by the interaction between the projectile ion , with charge @xmath13 , and target species prior to collision .",
    "this interaction is modeled by equation ( 2 ) where the potential energy of the channel is given as a function of internuclear distance @xmath14 , @xmath15 where coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 are estimated in @xcite . the second term represents a polarization interaction between the projectile and target , with @xmath18 being the dipole polarizability of the neutral target , whereas the first term accounts for the repulsive nature of the system at small internuclear distances .",
    "the final channel @xmath19 of the collision system is a coulombic repulsion interaction because the two product species are of positive charge .",
    "therefore , a simple coulomb repulsion potential is used , @xmath20 where , @xmath21 is the charge of the projectile after the collision and @xmath22 is the final charge of the target . for sec between an ion and neutral , @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 term is the energy released as a result of the charge exchange process and is precisely the sum of 1 ) the difference in ionization potentials of the product ion and the target species , and 2 ) the excitation energy of the product ion .",
    "the charge exchange probability is defined in terms of the transition from the initial channel to the final channel .",
    "the internuclear distance at which this transition can occur is referred to as the avoided crossing , @xmath25 .",
    "the avoided crossing distances are estimated by setting the initial and final potential curves equal to one another .",
    "these avoided crossings are used as input parameters in calculating the energy difference , @xmath26 , of the adiabatic potential at @xmath25 .",
    "we estimate @xmath26 using the olson - salop - tauljberg adaptation @xcite displayed in equation ( 4 ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath13 , and @xmath29 are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the charge exchange probability is thus dependent on three parameters : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the absolute value of the difference in slopes between the initial and final potential curves , @xmath30 . for a simple , 2-channel system ,",
    "the charge exchange probability is given as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given in @xcite as @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the radial component of the relative velocity of the collision @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , we compute multi - channel collision probabilities using the @xcite relation for all allowed product ion states . the possible product states are determined following the wigner - witmer rules @xcite for the angular momenta of the molecular channels and for channels connected to the initial channel via nonadiabatic radial coupling .",
    "therefore , this probability computation becomes complicated with increasing number of product ion states , which increases with @xmath13 , and may result in long computation times . finally , with these probabilities , we compute cross sections for charge exchange by considering the probability , collision energy , and all partial waves , @xmath36 , of the collision system , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the wave vector for relative motion in the initial channel @xmath39",
    ".      for bare ion collision systems , the product ion with a newly captured electron has @xmath6-states that are degenerate within a given @xmath0-state .",
    "the landau - zener theory requires that avoided crossing distances are well separated .",
    "therefore , we must apply @xmath6-distribution models to mclz @xmath0-resolved cross sections for bare ion collision systems .",
    "the _ statistical _ @xmath6-distribution discussed in @xcite is given by , @xmath40 and is recommended for collision energies @xmath41 10 kev / u . the _ low energy _ @xmath6-distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is given by , @xmath42^{2}}{(n+\\ell)!(n-1-\\ell)!},\\ ] ] and is recommended for collision energies @xmath43 10 - 100 ev / u .",
    "two other @xmath6-distribution models , obtained from and adopted in the atomdb charge exchange ( acx , * ? ? ? * ) model , are tested .",
    "we refer to them as the _ separable _ distribution , as displayed in equation ( 11 ) , and the _ modified low energy _ distribution given in equation ( 12 ) , @xmath44\\ ] ] and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that equation ( 12 ) gives a zero population for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) states and that equation ( 11 ) is the only distribution dependent on incident ion charge .",
    "none of the distribution functions have an explicit collision energy dependence .",
    "after charge exchange , the product ion is unstable as the electron is captured into a highly excited state .",
    "therefore , the charged ion stabilizes by emitting a photon .",
    "the photon energies associated with such cascading events range from the extreme uv to the x - ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum since the largest radiative probabilities correspond to decay to the ground state . using @xmath1-resolved cross sections ,",
    "the cascade model for x - ray emission assumes that atomic levels are populated based on their relative cross sections for electron capture into associated states . using this data alongside transition probabilities",
    ", the cascade model tracks the evolution of the electron s cascade from its highly - energetic state to stability by considering every possible transition that obeys the dipole selection rules @xmath48 and @xmath49 . forbidden and intercombination transitions from the triplet @xmath50 levels of he - like ions are also included . by considering all possible routes for this cascade and the initial population of states",
    ", one can compute theoretical emission lines for charge exchange induced x - ray emission , assuming an optically thin plasma , following the approach of @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compare such theoretical spectra for fe  xxv and fe  xxvi , that utilize the mclz @xmath51-resolved cross sections , to the experimental spectra obtained with the electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) experiment of @xcite .",
    "it is essential to consider all possible final channels of a given collision system and to have detailed knowledge of their excitation energies in order to properly identify avoided crossing locations , and ultimately , the @xcite probability relations .",
    "therefore , excitation energies are gathered in order to determine the @xmath24 values pertinent in the avoided crossing estimates . however , the main source for these excitation energies , the nist atomic spectra database ( @xcite ) , is often missing states  especially high - lying rydberg levels .",
    "therefore , we have employed quantum defect theory , which basically modifies the rydberg formula through an introduced quantum defect , @xmath52 . in an effort to approximate excitation energies for all states that must be considered for charge exchange to create he - like fe@xmath53 , we have devised a strategy to establish trends in quantum defect parameters . with these trends ,",
    "quantum defect theory estimates energy levels via the modified rydberg formula ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , equation ( 13 ) , where the parameters of the calculation are the following : ionization potential ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath0-level , @xmath6-level , and @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath55 also depends on the parameter @xmath56 resulting in the relations @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] the strategy employed in estimating the unknown energy levels is by finding trends in the parameter @xmath56 from available data .",
    "we apply these trends to high - lying rydberg - levels to estimate @xmath56 and ultimately , @xmath60 .",
    "until this point , we have generalized the method to compute the charge exchange cross sections and resulting x - ray spectra for a given cx collision system .",
    "now , we will display the results in applying this methodology to the two exemplary cases of fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 cx collisions .",
    "these charge exchange calculations were chosen for three reasons .",
    "first , the high charge of the fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 systems ( i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ) presents computational difficulties as more final channels ( final product ion states ) must be considered for the collision system .",
    "the dominant @xmath0-capture channel is given approximately by @xmath63 ; within each @xmath0 level , the number of @xmath6 levels is equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "because mclz calculations typically include all product ion states from n=1 to @xmath64 + 3 , the total number of channels roughly scales as @xmath65 or increases with charge as @xmath66 .",
    "this results in the charge exchange probability expression becoming much more complicated , as seen in the @xcite probability relations , and ultimately stress tests the mclz code .",
    "such a calculation using a more advanced method ( e.g. , qmocc ) would require more than 100 molecular channels and 1000s of nonadiabatic coupling elements ; such a calculation is not currently feasible .",
    "second , the presence of experimental x - ray emission data for these systems made these collisions an attractive option as it presents an opportunity to compare theoretical spectra to experiment . finally , the astrophysical relevance of fe xxv and fe xxvi emission in the galactic center and ridge @xcite makes these calculations useful for astrophysical modelers of these regions as charge exchange may be a dominant process .",
    "therefore , it is with this motivation that total , @xmath0-resolved , @xmath6-resolved , and @xmath11-resolved cross sections were calculated for fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 collisions with h , he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co.      to begin studying fe@xmath3 bare ion collisions , wigner - witmer rules are applied to determine possible product channels for the collision .",
    "these rules , based on electronic angular momentum conservation principles , indicate that the initial channel for fe@xmath3 colliding with h is a @xmath67 , while for all other targets it is a @xmath68 state .",
    "all product fe@xmath2 ions are doublets with a total electron spin @xmath69 ( which we drop in the notation for fe xxvi ) . with this information",
    "we perform landau - zener approximations to obtain total , @xmath0-resolved , and @xmath70-resolved cross sections .",
    "first , we examine the total cross sections for the collision systems of fe@xmath3 with various targets in figure 1 .",
    "one of these collision systems alone would take a significant amount of cpu months to calculate with more complex theories such as qmocc  and at only one collision energy .",
    "because of this effective landau - zener technique , total cross sections for fe@xmath3 collisions with h , he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co  for collision energies from 0.001 ev / u to 100 kev / u  are computed and quickly show an interesting trend that with increasing ionization potential of the target , we see decreasing total cross sections for collision energies @xmath41 10 ev / u .",
    "in addition to total cross sections , we can also investigate @xmath0-resolved cross sections .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , mclz calculations show that the electron capture into @xmath0 = 12 , 13 , and 14 generate the largest cross sections for fe@xmath3 collisions with n@xmath5 for energies applicable for the ebit experiment , @xmath71 10 ev / u . for systems of more astrophysical relevance , such as collisions with h and he at energies around 1 kev / u , figures 3 and 4 show that dominant capture is into @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "these dominant capture results are in good agreement with the @xcite ebit study .",
    "for instance , @xcite states that classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) calculations predict @xmath74 for single electron capture between fe@xmath3 and he to be @xmath75 , whereas their experiment observed @xmath76 and 12 .",
    "as shown in the mclz calculations in figure 4 , around @xmath71 10 ev / u @xmath77 and 12 ; thus , mclz theoretical results are in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "further , observed @xmath74 values from the ebit study for fe@xmath3 collisions with n@xmath5 and h@xmath5 are @xmath78 .",
    "mclz calculations again agree with experiment , as shown in figures 2 and 5 , respectively with @xmath74 predicted to be 13 or 14 .",
    "ctmc calculations have been previously performed for several fe@xmath3 charge exchange collisions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , total ctmc sec cross sections are in excellent agreement with mclz total cross sections for fe@xmath3 collisions with h. similarly , in figures 4 and 5 , ctmc results are compared to mclz for fe@xmath3 collisions with he and h@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "for both of these collisions , mclz predicts somewhat larger total cross sections than does ctmc .",
    "it is expected that the ctmc method will not be reliable for collision energies @xmath43 10 kev / u due to the neglect of tunneling effects , while mclz calculations do not perform well for incident energies @xmath41 5 kev / u @xcite .",
    "an @xmath70-resolved cross section analysis is performed in figure 6 to compare the various @xmath6-distribution models .",
    "it is worth noting that the distributions depicted in figure 6 apply to all fe@xmath3 charge exchange collisions with no restriction to collision energy or target .",
    "this universality is a downfall of the distribution models as they are independent of any parameters corresponding to these important factors .",
    "we see variance in each @xmath6-distribution model ; therefore , it is difficult to suggest which model is recommended until applying these various distributions to the cascade model for x - ray emission and comparing theoretical spectra to experimental data .",
    "therefore , by applying the various @xmath70-resolved cross sections to populate atomic levels , theoretical spectra are obtained and displayed in figure 7 for fe@xmath3 and n@xmath5 charge exchange collisions . in the same figure ,",
    "the experimental spectrum for the system is given as extracted from the ebit experiment @xcite which shows a strong peak near 9220 ev due to the ly@xmath52 ( @xmath79 ) and ly@xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) transitions .",
    "the intensity of this line is nearly as strong as ly@xmath18 at 6958 ev . to simulate the experimental conditions",
    ", we adopted the low - energy @xmath6-distribution function for mclz @xmath0-resolved cross sections at 10 ev / u which results in a line intensity at 9220 ev more than a factor of 2 smaller than the experiment ( normalizing to ly@xmath18 and assuming a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) line width of 150 ev ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for 100 ev / u .",
    "theoretical spectra using ctmc cross sections for fe@xmath3 + h show a similar behavior , but with an even smaller intensity at 9220 ev @xcite . to produce a strong line near 9220 ev",
    "requires large charge exchange cross sections to the 13@xmath82 and 14@xmath82 , but figure 6 indicates that the low - energy distribution peaks at @xmath83 .",
    "all other distributions peak at even larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "we postulate that to get agreement with the ebit high-@xmath0 emission peak that the cross sections to @xmath82-states should be enhanced . as a numerical experiment",
    ", we constructed an ad hoc @xmath6-distribution function @xmath84 in which @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is added to @xmath87 to preserve the normalization and @xmath88 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ shifted low - energy _",
    "( sl1 ) distribution .",
    "applying sl1 in the cascade / x - ray model gives the sl1 spectrum at 10 ev / u which is shown in figure 7 to be in better agreement with the ebit result .",
    "sl1 does underestimate ly@xmath28 and ly@xmath89 , but further manipulation of the distribution function is not warranted given the uncertainties in the experimental spectra .",
    "rather than presenting the spectra for all of the collision systems studied , table 1 gives line ratios for x - ray emission resulting from sec collisions between fe@xmath3 and h , he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co at three representative collision energies 10 , 100 , and 1000  ev / u . these line ratios were obtained by applying the low energy distribution ( equation 10 ) to mclz @xmath0-resolved cross sections and implementing the results into the x - ray cascade model .",
    "the line ratio depicts the ratio between a specific emission line and the @xmath90 line .      as was discussed for fe xxvi , product ion states",
    "must first be determined for the he - like fe@xmath53 which are produced following charge exchange with fe@xmath2 .",
    "as determined by wigner - witmer rules , fe@xmath2 collisions with h correlate to two molecular manifolds , @xmath68 and @xmath91 , which connect via radial couplings to molecular states of the same symmetry of the asymptotic product states of fe@xmath53 + h@xmath92 .",
    "as spin - changing collisions are forbidden , singlet and triplet mclz calculations are performed separately with the singlet cross sections weighted by an approach probability factor of @xmath93 , while the triplets are weighted by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , collisions with helium , molecular hydrogen , molecular nitrogen , water , and carbon monoxide correlate to doublet molecular states with both fe@xmath53 singlet and triplet states considered in a single mclz calculation . because both singlets and triplets must be considered , quantum defect theory is applied to estimate energies for all missing states of fe@xmath53 .",
    "all fe@xmath53 singlets states and their corresponding energies , as calculated by our implementation of quantum defect theory , are shown in figure 8 and compared to available nist data as well as energies estimated by the cloudy spectral synthesis code @xcite , which also implements a version of the quantum defect method . including all possible outgoing channels",
    "quickly makes the computation time significantly longer . in comparing the total cross sections for fe xxv collisions for multiple targets",
    ", we again see the interesting trend that with increasing ionization potential of the target , the total cross section decreases for collision energies @xmath41 10 ev / u as shown in figure 9 .",
    "cross sections at the @xmath0-resolved level for each collision system are also computed . in figure 10 , we display the @xmath0-resolved cross sections for fe@xmath2 collisions with n@xmath5 . around @xmath71 10",
    "ev / u , which we again anticipate being representative of ebit conditions , we see that dominant capture occurs into @xmath95 .",
    "again , we illustrate that dominant capture occurs into states for which energies are not supplied by nist .",
    "thus , we see that through the quantum defect method , we can rapidly estimate the energies of these high - lying rydberg states that assume vital roles in the fe@xmath2 charge exchange process . for astrophysical conditions",
    "@xmath71 1 kev / u , figures 11 and 12 display @xmath0-resolved cross sections for fe@xmath2 collisions with h and he , respectively .",
    "dominant capture for these processes occurs into @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "charge exchange collisions with h - like projectile ions result in non - degenerate product ions .",
    "thus , the use of @xmath6-distribution functions is not required nor recommended .",
    "however , it is commonplace for astrophysical modelers to incorporate such distribution functions for all charge exchange collisions  even those with multielectron product ions due to the general lack of such data @xcite .",
    "therefore , in figure 13 , we compare the results from @xmath51-resolved cross sections via mclz to @xmath96-resolved distribution functions for fe@xmath2 collisions with n@xmath5 . in this figure ,",
    "the three dominant @xmath0-levels for the collision are shown at three different energies .",
    "after comparing the distributions , we see that the low energy distribution function compares best to the explicit mclz calculations",
    ". when performing similar analyses to the distributions resulting from fe@xmath2 cx collisions with h , he , h@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co , some of the distributions tend towards the low energy modification function or the separable function .",
    "however , again , although it is not recommended , if one _ does _ use a distribution function for non - bare projectile ion charge exchange collisions , we suggest using the low energy distribution function , as given by equation ( 10 ) , in most cases . using the cascade model and @xmath51-resolved cross sections ,",
    "we obtain theoretical x - ray spectra as given by figure 14 for fe@xmath2 collisions with n@xmath5 with a fwhm of 150 ev .",
    "these theoretical spectra are shown alongside the @xcite fe xxv ebit experiment .",
    "we see reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra ; however , all theoretical models overestimate the experimental intensity of the k@xmath28 and higher lines with the overestimation increasing slightly with collision energy . as the k@xmath28 and",
    "higher lines originate only from fe@xmath53 singlet states , the comparison suggests that the mclz calculation predicts cross sections to @xmath97 with @xmath98 that are somewhat too large .",
    "again , we include line ratios for the various fe@xmath2 collision systems .",
    "mclz @xmath51-resolved cross sections were applied in the x - ray cascade model to obtain these ratios .",
    "table 2 gives the line ratios for x - ray emission resulting from sec collisions between fe@xmath2 and h , he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co at the same representative collision energies used in table 1 .",
    "here , the line ratios depict the ratio between a specific emission line and the @xmath99 resonant line .",
    "another useful diagnostic is the _ g_-ratio which is the ratio between the sum of the forbidden and intercombination line intensities to that of the resonant line @xcite .",
    "figure 15 displays the _",
    "g_-ratios as a function of collision energy for emission resulting from the studied fe@xmath2 single electron capture processes",
    ". also included in figure 15 are the _",
    "g_-ratio results presented in @xcite pertaining to electron impact excitation ( eie , or so - called thermal excitation ) for a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) , as well as the _",
    "g_-ratio for photoionization equilibrium ( pie ) or a recombining photoionized plasma @xcite .",
    "mclz charge exchange cross sections and their implementation into the x - ray cascade model yield similar @xmath100 among he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co targets with only a slight increase with collision energy . these fall near the maximum eie @xmath101-ratio which occurs for electron temperatures of @xmath7110@xmath102  k @xcite .",
    "conversely , the _ g_-ratio for fe@xmath2 and h charge exchange is @xmath713.7 , similar to the values obtained for a recombining plasma ( pie ) with an electron temperature of 10@xmath102  k @xcite .    unfortunately , the resolution of the ebit measurement was insufficient to resolve the individual k@xmath18 components to determine a @xmath101-ratio .",
    "however , it is possible to estimate the @xmath101-ratio from knowledge of the k@xmath18 line centroid . for fe@xmath2 collisions with n@xmath5 at 10 , 100 , and 1000 ev / u ,",
    "the centroids using the mclz cross sections are predicted to be 6686.3 , 6685.3 , and 6684.0 ev , respectively .",
    "these can be compared to the measured values for charge exchange , @xmath103 ev ( ebit beam off ) , and eie , @xmath104 ev ( ebit beam on ) @xcite . from the experimental centroid , we estimate @xmath105 , depending on the assumed relative forbidden and intercombination line intensities .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the computed @xmath101-ratios from the mclz calculations of 0.82 , 0.92 , and 1.05 for 10 , 100 , and 1000 ev / u , respectively .",
    "the total theoretical spectrum , sum of fe xxv and xxvi , is compared to the total ebit experimental spectrum in figure 16 .",
    "this total theoretical spectrum utilizes the shifted low energy ( sl1 ) distribution as discussed for fe@xmath3 collisions with n@xmath5 and the @xmath51-resolved cross sections for fe@xmath2 collisions with n@xmath5 . by summing the two theoretical spectra and eliminating any need for extraction of the associated product ion s contribution to the emission",
    ", we see excellent agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "figure 17 compiles all theoretical total and individual spectra with corresponding emission lines and the total experimental spectra with associated fe xxv and extracted fe xxvi from @xcite . from this figure",
    ", we can see each ion s contribution , theoretically and experimentally , to the overall spectra and the very good agreement overall for this system of two highly - charged ions .",
    "a number of approximations were required in both the cross section calculations and the x - ray spectra models .",
    "they are of such a magnitude that it is not meaningful to attempt to estimate the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "five main approximations are inherent in the current mclz calculations : i ) the splitting in the adiabatic potentials at the avoiding - crossing locations ( equation 4 ) , ii ) the adoption of the mclz probability formalism of @xcite , iii ) for h - like product ions , the adoption of an @xmath6-distribution model , iv ) for he - like product ions , the estimation of missing rydberg energies with the quantum defect approach , and v ) the neglect of multielectron capture ( mec ) processes . of these",

    "only long - range avoided - crossings are considered .",
    "the @xcite model can not treat short - range avoided - crossings which are usually highly endoergic . as a consequence , the cross sections for the highest @xmath0 , those which fall - off as @xmath106 for all energies , will be lower - limits for the highest collision energies . mec processes",
    "v ) also can not be treated with the sec mclz probability model . @xcite",
    "argue that mec processes do not play a significant role for these systems . on the other hand , in a combined experimental / theoretical study of ne@xmath107 collisions with he ,",
    "ne , and ar , @xcite find that mec could contribute from @xmath7110 - 50% of the x - ray spectrum with the fraction increasing with the number of electrons in the target .    in the cascade / x - ray emission models",
    ", we have assumed a low - density plasma environment in which only single collision events occur and the plasma is optically thin .",
    "optical depth effects and/or multiple collisions may become important thus modifying the predicted line ratios in high density environments .",
    "in addition , as detailed above , the cross sections were only computed for sec so that no mec effects are included in the x - ray spectra or line ratios .",
    "fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 charge exchange collisions with multiple targets were studied because of their astrophysical relevance in the galactic center , the galactic ridge , and other environments ; the computational difficulty that such highly charged systems ensued ; and the presence of experimental data for comparison .",
    "theoretical studies using quantum defect theory and the multi - channel landau - zener approach were able to compute , with ease , @xmath51-resolved cross sections for fe@xmath2 and fe@xmath3 collisions with h , he , h@xmath5 , n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co. this is the first time , to our knowledge , that mclz calculations have been performed for these systems . further , to our knowledge , this is the first time that such calculations have been performed altogether for fe@xmath3 collisions with n@xmath5 , h@xmath5o , and co and fe@xmath2 collisions with all targets considered in this work . with this new data and approach , comparisons of total fe xxv and fe xxvi theoretical spectra to total experimental ebit spectra demonstrate very good agreement . through the simplicity of the mclz method ,",
    "this data was generated quickly and robustly thus allowing interesting trends to be identified .",
    "namely , with increasing ionization potential of the target , we see decreasing total cross sections for collision energies @xmath41 10 ev / u .",
