    "belief change and belief merging have been topics of interest in artificial intelligence for three decades @xcite .",

    "mostly , the question tackled in these works is `` how should rationality postulates and change operators be adapted to ensure that the result of belief change belongs to a given fragment ? '' .",
    "surprisingly , the question concerning the extent to which the result of a belief change operation can deviate from the fragment under consideration has been neglected so far . in order to tackle this question , we focus here on a certain form of reverse merging",

    "arbitrary _ knowledge base @xmath0 and some ic - merging ( i.e.  merging with integrity constraint , see @xcite ) , operator @xmath1 can we find a profile @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ a tuple of knowledge bases , and a constraint @xmath3 , both from a given _ fragment _ of classical logic , such that @xmath4 yields a result equivalent to @xmath0 ?",
    "in other words , we are interested in seeing if @xmath0 can be distributed into knowledge bases of simpler structure , such that the task of merging allows for a reconstruction of the original knowledge .",
    "we call this operation _ knowledge distribution_.    studying the concept of knowledge distribution can be motivated from different points of view .",
    "first , consider a scenario where the storage devices have limited expressibility , for instance , databases or logic programs .",
    "our analysis will show which merging operators are required to reconstruct arbitrary knowledge stored in such a set of limited devices .",
    "second , distribution can also be understood as a tool to hide information ; only users who know the used merging operator ( which thus acts as an encryption key ) are able to faithfully retrieve the distributed knowledge . given the high complexity of belief change ( even for revision in `` simple '' fragments like @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ) , brute - force attack to guess the merging operator is unthinkable .",
    "finally , from the theoretical perspective our results shed light on the power of different merging operators when applied to profiles from certain fragments .",
    "in particular , our results show that merging @xmath7 formulas via the hamming - distance based operator @xmath8 does not need additional care , since the result is guaranteed to stay in the fragment .",

    "we want to decompose arbitrary bases into a fragment - profile .",
    "recent work by liberatore has also addressed a form of meta - reasoning over belief change operators . in @xcite ,",

    ". finally , even if our approach may seem related to _ knowledge compilation _ ( kc ) @xcite , both methods are in fact conceptually different .",

    "consider the vectors @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "our claim is that @xmath290 . to see why , notice that the elements in @xmath291 form a complete subset lattice with @xmath292 and @xmath293 as the top and bottom elements , respectively .",
    "let us write @xmath294 .",
    "this lattice has @xmath295 elements , and the maximum distance of two elements in it is @xmath296 .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath297 is the vector of distances between @xmath73 and every other element in this lattice , except itself and @xmath298 .",
    "a similar consideration holds for @xmath299 .",
    "hence @xmath297 and @xmath299 are vectors of length @xmath300 whose elements are @xmath301 .",
    "we can actually count how many times each number appears in @xmath297 and @xmath299 .",
    "the number of interpretations in the lattice that are at distance of 1 from @xmath73 ( and @xmath298 ) is @xmath302 : thus , @xmath303 appears @xmath302 times in @xmath297 ( and @xmath299 ) .",
    "the number of interpretations that are at distance 2 from @xmath73 ( and @xmath298 ) is @xmath304 , thus @xmath305 appears @xmath304 times in @xmath297 and @xmath299 .",
    "we iterate this argument for every distance , up to 1 .",
    "it is then easy to see that , based on these considerations , @xmath297 and @xmath299 are equal when sorted in descending order .",
    "our conclusion follows from this .",
    "we show that every knowledge base @xmath0 can be distributed in the fragment @xmath52 .",
    "even a single @xmath52 knowledge base is enough to represent @xmath0 . before giving the general result , we sketch the idea via an example .",
    "let @xmath0 be a kb with @xmath306 .",
    "we observe that @xmath0 is not @xmath52-expressible since @xmath307 .",

    "we use @xmath3 such that @xmath312 and get distances @xmath316 here , each line gives the distance between a model of @xmath3 and a model of @xmath10 ( @xmath317 columns ) , or between a model of @xmath3 and @xmath10 ( @xmath318 column ) .",
    "the key observation is that pairs from @xmath308 as used in @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath319 give minimal distances @xmath53 while the remaining interpretation @xmath320 , which corresponds to the closure of @xmath0 , contains all three new atoms ( since @xmath321).@xmath130    [ theorem : krom - representability ] any kb @xmath0 is @xmath52-simplifiable w.r.t .",

    "we have to show that for any kb @xmath0 , there exists an @xmath52-kb @xmath10 and a formula @xmath323 such that @xmath324 .",
    "if @xmath0 is @xmath52-expressible , the result is due to proposition  [ prop : clear ] .",

    "consider a set of new atoms @xmath326 , and for each @xmath327 , let @xmath328 .",
    "we define the @xmath52-kb @xmath10 and @xmath311 such that @xmath329 let @xmath330 .",
    "we first show that for each @xmath331 , @xmath332 . indeed , for any triple @xmath333 , such that @xmath334 , we observe that @xmath335 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath336 , @xmath332 .",
    "recall that @xmath337 .",
    "it follows quite easily that each further interpretation @xmath338 , also satisfies @xmath332 .",
    "this shows that each model of @xmath10 contains at least @xmath339 atoms from @xmath340 .",

    "in this paper we have proposed the notion of distributability and we have studied the properties of several merging operators with respect to different fragments of propositional logic .",

    "symbol @xmath444 means we know that some non - trivial knowledge bases can be distributed , and finally @xmath445 means that some , but not all , non - trivial bases can be simplified .",
    "interestingly , the picture emerging from table  [ table : summary ] is that merging operators behave quite differently depending on the distance and aggregation function employed , in a way that does not lend itself to simple categorization .",
    "for instance , our results on simplifiability imply that using dalal revision to @xmath59 kbs never takes us outside the @xmath7 fragment ; applying the same revision operator to @xmath52 kbs can produce any kb in @xmath14 ; and applying it to @xmath49 kbs can produce some , though not all possible kbs .",
    "several questions are still open for future work .",
    "we plan to study the exact characterization of what can ( and can not ) be distributed , in order to replace the symbols @xmath444 and @xmath445 in the previous table .",
    "other merging operators can also be integrated to our study .",
    "some of our results on distributability require the addition of new atoms to the interpretations .",
    "we want to determine whether similar results can be obtained without modifying the set of propositional variables , in particular for the @xmath6 fragment .",
    "we are also interested in the number of knowledge bases needed to distribute knowledge : given an integer @xmath166 , a knowledge base @xmath0 and a merging operator @xmath1 , is it possible to distribute @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath1 such that the resulting profile contains at most @xmath166 knowledge bases ? this paper was a first step to understand the limits of distributability ; the actual construction of the profile and complexity of this process are important questions that will be tackled in future research .",
