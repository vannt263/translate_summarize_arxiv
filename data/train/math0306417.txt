    "a particular consequence is that the projection onto the positive quadrant @xmath15^d } f(\\xi ) \\operatorname   e^{ix \\cdot\\xi } \\ ; d\\xi\\ ] ] is a bounded operator on all @xmath13 , as it is merely a tensor product of the one dimensional projections .    a rectangle in @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "define the fourier restriction operator to be @xmath17 this projection operator is bounded on all @xmath13 , with constant bounded independently of @xmath1 . to see this ,",
    "define the modulation operators by @xmath18 observe that for @xmath19 , the interval @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 .",
    "hence this projection is uniformly bounded . by taking linear combinations of projections of this type ,",
    "we can obtain the @xmath22 boundedness of any projection operator @xmath23 , for rectangles @xmath24 .",

    "we adopt a ` time - frequency ' approach to the theorem , inspired in part by the author s joint work with christoph thiele @xcite .. the same pattern is adopted for the multiplier questions .",

    "an initial version of these notes was prepared while in residence at the schrdinger institute of vienna austria .",
    "the paper has been improved by the efforts of a conscientious referee .",
    "in this setting , we give the proof in one dimension , as it is very much easier in this case .",
    "in addition , some of the ideas in this case will extend immediately to the higher dimensional case .",

''    to conclude the theorem as stated , one method uses an extension of the boundedness of the hilbert transform to a vector valued setting .",
    "the particular form needed concerns the extension of the hilbert transform to functions taking values in @xmath74 spaces .",
    "in particular , we have the inequalities @xmath75 vector valued inequalities are strongly linked to weighted inequalities , and one of the standard approaches to these inequalities depends upon the beautiful inequality of c.  fefferman and e.m .",
    "stein @xcite @xmath76 the implied constant depends only on @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "while we stated this for the hilbert transform , it is important for our purposes to further note that this inequality continues to hold for a wide range of caldern  zygmund operators , including those that occur in ( [ e.k ] ) .",
    "this is an observation that goes back to j.  schwartz @xcite , with many extensions , especially that of benedek , caldern and panzone @xcite .",
    "the proof that ( [ e.weighted ] ) implies ( [ e.vectorh ] ) follows .",
    "note that we need only prove the vector valued estimates for @xmath79 , as the remaining estimates follow by duality , namely the dual estimate of @xmath80 is @xmath81 , in which the primes denote the conjugate index , @xmath82 .",
    "the cases of @xmath83 are trivial . for @xmath84 , and @xmath85 of norm one",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath86 to do so , by duality , we can take @xmath87 of norm one , and estimate @xmath88 provided we take @xmath89 .",
    "now , the fourier projection onto an interval @xmath24 can be obtained as a linear combination of modulations of the hilbert transform . using this",
    ", one sees that the estimate ( [ e.vectorh ] ) extends to the fourier projections onto intervals .",
    "namely , we have the estimate @xmath90 this is valid for all collections of intervals @xmath2 . applying it to ( [ e.smoothlp ] ) , with @xmath91 , and using the fact that @xmath92 proves the upper half of the inequalities of .lpineq/ , which what we wanted .    for our subsequent use",
    ", we note that the vector valued extension of the hilbert transform depends upon structural estimates that continue to hold for a wide variety of caldern  zygmund kernels .",
    "in particular , the littlewood  paley inequalities also admit a vector valued extension , @xmath93      we begin the main line of argument for rubio de francia s inequality in one dimension .",
    "the first step , found by rubio de francia @xcite , is a reduction of the general case to one in which one can square function by a smoother object .",
    "say that a collection of intervals @xmath2 is _",
    "well distributed _ if @xmath94 thus , after dilating the intervals in the collection of a factor of ( say ) @xmath95 , at most @xmath96 intervals can intersect .",
    "the well distributed collections allow one to smooth out @xmath97 , just as one does @xmath98}$ ] in the proof of the classical littlewood  paley inequality .",
    "the main fact we should observe here is that    [ l.wellsuffice ] for each collection of intervals @xmath2 , we can define a well distributed collection @xmath99 for which @xmath100    the argument here depends upon inequalities for vector valued singular integral operators .",
