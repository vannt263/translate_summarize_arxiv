    "motion camouflage is a stealth strategy employed by various visual insects and animals to achieve prey capture , mating or territorial combat . in one type of motion camouflage ,",
    "the predator camouflages itself against a fixed background object so that the prey observes no relative motion between the predator and the fixed object . in the other type of motion camouflage ,",
    "the predator approaches the prey such that from the point of view of the prey , the predator always appears to be at the same bearing .",
    "( in this case , we say that the object against which the predator is camouflaged is the point at infinity . ) for background on motion camouflage , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "motion camouflage behavior in insects is described in @xcite ( based on earlier work in @xcite on hoverflies ) and in @xcite ( for dragonflies ) .",
    "related themes in insect vision and flight control are also found in @xcite .",
    "the essential features of motion camouflage are not limited to visual insects .",
    "recent work on the neuroethology of insect - capture behavior in echolocating bats reveals a strategy geometrically indistinguishable from motion camouflage , referred to as the `` constant absolute target direction '' ( catd ) strategy @xcite .",
    "because the bat under study , _ eptesicus fuscus _ , hunts at night , there is no reason to suppose that camouflage ( i.e. , misleading its prey s visual system ) is the bat s goal in using the catd strategy . in this paper , we are concerned with describing in the simplest possible , biologically plausible way _ how _ the motion camouflage or catd strategy can be achieved using feedback control .",
    "this is a small first step toward understanding the much more difficult question of _ why _ an animal like the bat _ eptesicus fuscus _ uses such a strategy .",
    "what sets this work apart is the structured approach used to derive feedback laws for motion control in three dimensions .",
    "we model the pursuer ( i.e. , predator ) and evader ( i.e. , prey ) as point particles subject to curvature ( steering ) control .",
    "although the speeds of the particles may vary , this variation is considered to result primarily from flight conditions the animal experiences - not primarily as a result of explicit speed control for purposes of achieving motion camouflage .",
    "indeed , the feedback law we derive for motion camouflage is well - defined for constant - speed motion .",
    "however , for comparing the theoretical feedback law to the experimentally - derived bat trajectory data , it is useful to retain speed variability in the model , since speed variations on the order of 50 percent are observed as the bat maneuvers .",
    "this focus on systematic formulation and analysis of biologically plausible feedback laws for motion camouflage is a distinguishing feature of our work .",
    "for example , in @xcite motion camouflage trajectories are studied , but without explicitly providing feedback laws which give rise to them .",
    "in @xcite , feedback using neural networks is used to achieve motion camouflage , but our approach has the advantage of giving an explicit form and straightforward physical interpretation for the feedback control law",
    ".    in earlier work , motion camouflage in the planar setting was studied , and a feedback law to achieve motion camouflage was derived @xcite .",
    "the name given to the feedback law was _ motion camouflage proportional guidance _ ( mcpg ) . here",
    ", we extend this work by formulating the problem in three dimensions and generalizing the feedback law to the three dimensional setting .",
    "the key is to describe the particle trajectories using natural frenet frames @xcite - the same approach demonstrated successfully in the context of formation control for constant - speed particles @xcite .",
    "this formulation can also be used to describe missile guidance , specifically , pure proportional navigation guidance ( ppng ) @xcite , cleanly in three dimensions .",
    "for concreteness , we consider the problem of motion camouflage in which the predator ( which we refer to as the `` pursuer '' ) attempts to intercept the prey ( which we refer to as the `` evader '' ) while appearing to the prey as though it is always at the same bearing ( i.e. , motion camouflaged against the point at infinity ) .",

    "we model the pursuer and evader as point particles , and use natural frames and curvature controls to describe their motion , because this is a simple model for which we can derive both physical intuition and concrete control laws .",
    "flying insects and animals ( also unmanned aerial vehicles ) have limited maneuverability and must maintain sufficient airspeed to stay aloft , so modeling them in this way is physically reasonable , at least for some range of flight conditions .    note that the forces supplied by the curvature controls are perpendicular to the instantaneous direction of motion , and therefore do not change the speed : these forces are _ gyroscopic _ forces . however , in ( [ pursuer3d ] ) and ( [ evader3d ] ) we do allow for the possibility of speed variations , as well .      motion camouflage with respect to the point at infinity",

    "in the biological context , one direction being pursued is the interpretation of three - dimensional trajectory data taken from experiments in which a bat , _ eptesicus fuscus _ , pursues a flying praying mantis ( whose hearing organ is disabled so that its trajectory is not influenced by the presence of the bat ) .",
    "the hypothesis that the bat uses an mcpg strategy during the capture phase of its engagement with the mantis is currently being tested using experimental data collected in the auditory neuroethology laboratory at the university of maryland ( http://www.bsos.umd.edu/psyc/batlab ) .",
    "this work represents part of a larger program to understand sensory - motor processing and feedback in biological model systems .",
    "another aspect of motion camouflage currently under study is discovering feedback laws for motion camouflage with respect to a finite point ( as opposed to the point at infinity ) .",
    "in finite - point motion camouflage , the pursuer uses a fixed object as camouflage as it approaches the evader , and this strategy also appears to be biologically revelant .",
    "various scenarios for motion camouflage involving teams of pursuers are also of interest , particularly in combination with formation - control laws based on gyroscopic interactions @xcite .",
    "some possible scenarios for team motion camouflage appear in @xcite ."
