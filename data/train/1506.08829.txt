    "hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation typically model gas cooling by tabulating the cooling rate as a function of gas properties such as the density and temperature , under certain assumptions .",
    "for example , the simplest approach , as used in some of the first cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is to assume that the gas has primordial abundances and is in collisional ionisation equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "@xcite also included the effects of metal - line cooling , computing cooling curves in cie for a range of metallicities .",
    "another effect that can be important for gas cooling is the presence of a photoionising uv radiation field , which can change the ionisation balance and heat the gas .",
    "@xcite showed that an extragalactic uv background ( uvb ) can suppress the cooling rate in a primordial plasma , thereby inhibiting the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite implemented primordial radiative cooling in the presence of a uvb in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "@xcite considered the impact that a photoionising uvb has on cooling rates in the presence of metals .",
    "they showed that photoionisation can suppress the cooling rate by up to an order of magnitude at temperatures and densities typical of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "they also showed that variations in relative abundances from their solar values can change the cooling rate by a factor of a few .",
    "@xcite tabulated the cooling rate from 11 elements separately in the presence of the redshift - dependent uvb of @xcite , and these tables have been used in several cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of metal cooling and uv radiation are particularly important below @xmath10 , as cooling from atomic hydrogen becomes inefficient at such temperatures . in primordial gas ,",
    "the only major coolants are h@xmath2 and hd ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these molecules can easily be dissociated by lyman - werner radiation ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "if metals are present , efficient cooling can continue down to @xmath12 via fine - structure line emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , the presence of uv radiation will hinder cooling to such low temperatures , as it heats the gas via photoionisation and photoelectric heating from dust grains , the latter of which also depends on metallicity .",
    "metallicity and uv radiation therefore influence the transition from the warm ( @xmath13 ) to the cold ( @xmath14 ) gas phase .",
    "@xcite investigated the warm - to - cold transition by calculating the minimum pressure , and hence the minimum density , at which a cold phase can exist in pressure equilibrium with a warm phase , as a function of uv intensity , metallicity , dust abundance and ionisation rate from cosmic rays and extreme uv ( euv)/x - ray radiation ( see their equations 33 - 35 ) .",
    "this minimum density increases with decreasing metallicity and increasing uv intensity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the critical surface density above which a cold ism phase can form in a galactic disc increases with decreasing metallicity and increasing uv intensity ( see his equation 23 ) .",
    "he additionally showed that the formation of a cold phase can trigger gravitational instabilities , due to the lower velocity dispersion in cold gas .",
    "metallicity and uv radiation can thus affect the star forming properties of galaxies , in particular the threshold surface density below which star formation is unable to proceed .",
    "the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen also depends on metallicity and uv radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of the above approaches assume that the gas is in chemical ( including ionisation ) equilibrium , or in other words , that the abundances of individual ions and molecules have reached an equilibrium or steady state",
    ". however , this assumption may not be valid if the dynamical or cooling time - scale of the gas is short compared to the chemical time - scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or if the uv radiation field is varying on time - scales shorter than the chemical time - scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry has been shown to affect cooling rates in certain idealised scenarios .",
    "for example , in collisionally ionised gas that is cooling either isobarically or isochorically , the cooling rate computed self - consistently from non - equilibrium abundances is suppressed at temperatures @xmath15 compared to gas in cie ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . @xcite investigated non - equilibrium ionisation and cooling in the presence of a photoionising radiation field , and they showed that the uvb reduces the non - equilibrium effects , although the cooling rates at @xmath15 are still suppressed with respect to chemical equilibrium .",
    "@xcite showed that , at temperatures below @xmath10 , the direction of the non - equilibrium effects is reversed and the cooling rates are enhanced , due to an increase in the electron abundance compared to equilibrium .",
    "these studies considered special cases of a plasma that is cooling at constant density or pressure .",
    "@xcite compared equilibrium and non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling in high - resolution simulations of a turbulent medium , in a box @xmath16 across .",
    "they found that non - equilibrium chemistry did have a noticeable , albeit fairly small , effect on the gas temperature in their simulations .",
    "@xcite applied a treatment for non - equilibrium cooling to simulations of a supernova remnant , and showed that the evolution of the supernova remnant is sensitive to non - equilibrium effects .",
    "however , it remains to be seen whether such non - equilibrium effects will be relevant on galactic scales .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effects of metallicity , uv radiation and non - equilibrium chemistry on galaxy formation .",
    "we run a series of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies with stellar and total halo masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the simulations use a resolution of @xmath1 per particle and a gravitational force softening of @xmath19 , which is sufficient to resolve the warm - to - cold transition .",
    "we consider a range of metallicities , @xmath20 , and a range of uv radiation fields that span nearly three orders of magnitude in hi photoionisation rate : the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) of @xcite , ten per cent of the @xcite isrf and the redshift zero extragalactic uv background ( uvb ) of @xcite .",
    "we include a local prescription for self - shielding by gas and dust , and we also consider a model without self - shielding for comparison .",
    "we first run these simulations with the temperature and chemical abundances of the gas evolved using the non - equilibrium chemical model of @xcite , which follows the ionisation states of 11 elements that are important for the gas cooling rate , along with the abundances of 20 molecular species , including h@xmath2 and co. we then compare these to simulations evolved using cooling rates tabulated in chemical equilibrium .",
    "in addition to the dynamical impact on the galaxy due to the effects on the cooling rate , non - equilibrium chemistry can also affect observable diagnostics of individual chemical species , e.g. in the presence of a fluctuating uv field @xcite , or in the presence of supersonic turbulence @xcite . to investigate how non - equilibrium chemistry can affect observable emission on galactic scales , we perform radiative transfer calculations in post - processing to compute line emission from cii and co.",
    "we then compare the intensity of line emission computed from non - equilibrium abundances to that computed assuming chemical equilibrium .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ models_section ]",
    "we describe the hydrodynamic methods and subgrid physics models used in our simulations .",
    "we present our simulations in section  [ simulations ] , where we discuss the initial conditions ( [ ic_section ] ) , morphologies and star formation rates ( [ sf_section ] ) , outflow properties ( [ outflows_section ] ) , and the phase structure of the ism ( [ phase_structure ] ) .",
    "we compute the observable line emission from cii and co in section  [ line_emission ] , and we summarise our main results in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our simulations were run using a modified version of the tree / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget3 ( last described in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations were solved using the set of numerical methods known as anarchy , which includes many of the latest improvements to the standard sph implementation . in particular",
    ", anarchy uses the pressure - entropy formulation of sph , derived by @xcite ; the artificial viscosity switch of @xcite ; a switch for artificial conduction , similar to that used in @xcite ; the time - step limiters of @xcite ; and the @xmath21 @xcite kernel .",
    "anarchy will be described in more detail in dalla vecchia ( in preparation ) ; see also appendix a of @xcite for a description of the implementation of anarchy in the cosmological simulations that were run for the eagle project , which is identical to the anarchy implementation that we use here .",
    "we use prescriptions to model physical processes that are unresolved in our simulations , including the chemical evolution of ions and molecules , radiative cooling , star formation and stellar feedback .",
    "these subgrid models are summarised below .",
    "we use the chemical model of @xcite to evolve the chemical abundances of 157 species , including all ionisation states of the 11 elements that are most important for cooling and 20 molecular species , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , oh , h@xmath24o , c@xmath2 , o@xmath2 , hco@xmath25 , ch , ch@xmath2 , ch@xmath23 , co , ch@xmath25 , ch@xmath22 , oh@xmath25 , h@xmath2o@xmath25 , h@xmath26o@xmath25 , co@xmath25 , hoc@xmath25 , o@xmath22 . ] .",
    "the gas temperature is evolved using radiative cooling and heating rates calculated from the non - equilibrium abundances .",
    "this gives us a set of 158 differential equations ( 157 chemical rate equations and the energy equation ) , which we integrate over each hydrodynamic timestep for each gas particle .",
    "we integrate these differential equations using the backward difference formula method and newton iteration in cvode ( from the sundials suite of non - linear differential / algebraic equation solvers ) , using a relative tolerance of @xmath27 and an absolute tolerance of @xmath28 .",
    "we summarise the main chemical and thermal processes that are included in our model below .",
    "we include collisional ionisation , radiative and di - electronic recombinations and charge transfer reactions .",
    "the formation of molecular hydrogen occurs on dust grains , using equation 18 of @xcite with a dust temperature @xmath29 , as well as via gas phase reactions .",
    "we also include cosmic ray ionisations , assuming a primary ionisation rate of atomic hydrogen due to cosmic rays of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the primary ionisation rates of other species due to cosmic rays are then scaled to this value using the ratios in the umist database @xcite where available , or using the equations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite otherwise .",
    "we include secondary ionisations of hi and hei from cosmic rays using the tables of @xcite , assuming a typical mean primary electron energy of @xmath31 .",
    ".properties of the uv radiation fields considered in this paper . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the presence of the @xcite isrf ( ref and hiz ) , we find that the mean @xmath6 factor decreases by a factor @xmath7 when we use non - equilibrium abundances . at lower radiation field strengths ( lowisrf and uvb ) ,",
    "the effect of non - equilibrium chemistry on the mean @xmath6 factor is much smaller ( e.g. @xmath32 per cent in the uvb runs ) .",
    "nevertheless , we saw in fig .",
    "[ line_noneq_fig ] that the mean co intensity for weaker radiation fields is lower , by a factor of @xmath33 , when we use non - equilibrium abundances than in equilibrium .",
    "we also find fewer pixels with @xmath34 above the detection threshold of @xmath35 when we use non - equilibrium abundances in these examples .",
    "if we find fewer pixels with detectable co emission when we use non - equilibrium abundances , we might also expect this to have an impact on the fraction of co - dark molecular gas , i.e. molecular hydrogen that is not traced by co emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calculated the co dark fraction in the simulations ref , hiz , lowisrf and uvb .",
    "this is the mass of h@xmath2 in pixels with @xmath36 divided by the mass of h@xmath2 in all pixels of the co map . for each simulation",
    ", we averaged this co dark fraction over ten snapshots taken at intervals of 100 myr .",
    "when we use h@xmath2 abundances and co maps in non - equilibrium , the co dark fraction is @xmath37 in these four simulations , with no strong dependence on metallicity or uv radiation field .",
    "however , when we set the abundances to chemical equilibrium , the co dark fraction in the uvb and lowisrf runs decreases to 0.63 and 0.59 , respectively . in the ref and hiz",
    "runs , the effect of non - equilibrium chemistry is weaker , as the co dark fraction only changes by ten per cent when we use equilibrium abundances .",
    "@xcite used theoretical models of molecular clouds to determine the co dark fraction for different cloud masses and uv radiation fields .",
    "they found an almost constant co dark fraction of 0.3 , although they only considered individual clouds , whereas we compute the co dark fraction over the disc of the galaxy , including diffuse gas .",
    "@xcite simulated four milky way - type galaxies with different gas surface densities and uv radiation fields .",
    "they found co dark fractions of @xmath38 . the highest values that they found are consistent with our simulations , although they also found that increasing the strength of the uv radiation field by a factor of 10 increases the co dark fraction by a factor of @xmath39 .",
    "we do not find any strong dependence on uv radiation field in our simulations .",
    "we have run a series of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies with a virial mass @xmath40 and stellar mass @xmath0 .",
    "the models use a resolution of @xmath1 per gas particle and a gravitational force resolution of @xmath19 , and were run with a modified version of the sph code gadget3 .",
    "we included a treatment for the full non - equilibrium chemical evolution of ions and molecules ( 157 species in total ) , along with gas cooling rates computed self - consistently from these non - equilibrium abundances @xcite , and we compared these to simulations evolved using cooling rates in chemical equilibrium .",
    "our simulations were run at a fixed metallicity and in the presence of a uniform uv radiation field , with a local prescription for self - shielding by gas and dust .",
    "we covered a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , and different uv radiation fields that span nearly three orders of magnitude in hi photoionisation rate ( the @xcite isrf , ten per cent of the @xcite isrf , and the redshift zero uvb of @xcite ; see table  [ uv_table ] ) , and we also repeated the runs with the @xcite uvb without self - shielding .",
    "our goal was to investigate the effects of metallicity , radiation field and non - equilibrium chemistry , which have all been demonstrated to affect gas cooling rates , in simulations of galaxy evolution .",
    "there are two aspects to the impact of these effects .",
    "firstly , how the changes in gas cooling rates affect the evolution of the galaxy , and secondly , how observable tracers of individual chemical species are affected .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .   in simulations at higher",
    "metallicity , and for weaker uv radiation fields , gas can more easily cool to a cold ( @xmath44 ) , star forming ism phase , due to increased metal - line cooling and reduced uv heating respectively .",
    "we thus find higher star formation rates in these cases , by two orders of magnitude and a factor @xmath45 for the different metallicities and different radiation fields , respectively , that we consider here ( fig .",
    "[ sfh ] ) .",
    "in particular , the gas surface density threshold below which star formation is cut off decreases with increasing metallicity and decreasing uv radiation field ( fig .",
    "[ ks ] ) , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "we find higher mass outflow rates at higher metallicity ( by two orders of magnitude ) and for weaker radiation fields ( by a factor @xmath45 ) , due to the higher star formation rates ( fig .",
    "[ radial_outflows_fig ] ) . however , the average mass loading factor ( i.e. the ratio of outflow to star formation rates ) , measured at @xmath46 , is @xmath47 , regardless of metallicity or radiation field .",
    "3 .   the mass loading factor , @xmath48 , measured @xmath49 above and below the disc decreases with increasing gas surface density , @xmath50 , following approximately a power - law , @xmath51 ( fig .  [ mass_loading_fig ] ) . at fixed @xmath50 ,",
    "the mass loading factor increases with decreasing metallicity and increasing radiation field strength .",
    "4 .   non - equilibrium cooling does not strongly affect the total star formation rate of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ sfh ] ) .",
    "the initial rise in mass outflow rate in the first @xmath52 of the simulation is sometimes more gradual when we use equilibrium cooling , compared to the non - equilibrium runs ( fig .",
    "[ radial_outflows_fig ] ) .",
    "however , apart from this initial difference , non - equilibrium cooling does not strongly affect the outflow properties . 5 .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry does have a large effect on the chemical make - up of outflowing gas ( fig .",
    "[ h2_outflow_fig ] ) .",
    "for example , in our reference run ( black curves in fig .",
    "[ h2_outflow_fig ] ) , we find on average @xmath53 of h@xmath2 outflowing with a vertical velocity of @xmath3 if we use non - equilibrium abundances , compared to @xmath54 if we assume chemical equilibrium .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry therefore enhances the mass of outflowing h@xmath2 by a factor @xmath4 in this example .",
    "this has important implications for modelling molecular outflows in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies .",
    "we investigated where in the temperature - density plane molecular hydrogen is out of equilibrium ( fig .",
    "[ noneqratio_h2_fig ] ) .",
    "h@xmath2 can be enhanced , by up to six orders of magnitude , in gas that was previously in molecular clouds at higher densities but has since been disrupted .",
    "we also find regions , around @xmath55 , where h@xmath2 is underabundant , by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this is due to gas that is starting to form molecular clouds , but has not yet had enough time to fully form h@xmath2 .",
    "7 .   using the publicly available monte - carlo radiative transfer code radmc-3d , we performed radiative transfer calculations on our simulations in post - processing to compute the line emission from cii and co. cii emission from the @xmath56 line is stronger at higher metallicity and for stronger radiation fields ( fig .",
    "[ cii_emission_fig ] ) , while co emission from the @xmath57 line is stronger at higher metallicity and for weaker radiation fields ( fig .  [ co_emission_fig ] ) . 8 .",
    "cii emission is generally unaffected by non - equilibrium chemistry , whereas co emission is affected by a factor of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ line_noneq_fig ] ) . however , the co emission can be either higher or lower in non - equilibrium , since , similarly to h@xmath2 , the co abundance can be either enhanced or suppressed .",
    "this also affects the mean @xmath6 conversion factor between co line intensity and h@xmath2 column density ( equation  [ co_equation ] ) that we measure in the simulations , by up to a factor @xmath7 ( table .",
    "[ xco_table ] ) . 9",
    ".   non - equilibrium chemistry also affects the fraction of co - dark molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. the fraction of molecular hydrogen that is not traced by observable co emission .",
    "for example , in our ` lowisrf ' run , we find @xmath58 per cent of the h@xmath2 mass in the central @xmath59 of the disc lies in pixels with @xmath36 if we use non - equilibrium abundances , compared to @xmath60 per cent if we assume chemical equilibrium .    to summarise",
    ", we have demonstrated that metallicity and uv radiation affect the global properties of galaxies , such as their star formation rates , and the observable signatures of individual chemical species .",
    "in contrast , non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling generally do not strongly affect the global properties of galaxies , although they do affect the observable diagnostics , particularly in molecular gas .    to investigate",
    "how sensitive these results are to the resolution of the simulations , we also repeated the ref simulation twice , with a mass resolution a factor of four higher and lower than our fiducial resolution of @xmath1 .",
    "we find that our results are mostly unaffected by resolution over the range that we test here .",
    "in particular , the star formation rates ( fig .  [ sfh ] ) are similar at the three different resolutions , although the low resolution run shows a smoother star formation history with no strong bursts . the mass loading factors of the outflows ( fig .",
    "[ mass_loading_fig ] ) are also similar at different resolutions .",
    "the mass of outflowing molecular hydrogen ( fig .",
    "[ h2_outflow_fig ] ) is similar at our fiducial and high resolutions , although the low resolution run shows less difference between non - equilibrium and equilibrium in the molecular outflows .",
    "however , there are several important caveats that we need to highlight that may mean that we have underestimated the importance of non - equilibrium chemistry in these simulations .",
    "firstly , we simulate isolated galaxies that do not include cosmological processes such as galaxy mergers and accretion of gas onto the galaxy .",
    "we might expect that such processes could enhance the non - equilibrium effects .",
    "for example , during and immediately after a merger , the ism will evolve rapidly as it re - distributes its gas in the temperature - density plane .",
    "this could potentially drive chemical abundances further out of equilibrium . to investigate the importance of such processes for the chemistry",
    ", we could repeat this study using cosmological zoomed simulations of individual galaxy haloes .    secondly , turbulence in the ism can also drive chemical abundances out of equilibrium .",
    "for example , @xcite recently presented a series of high - resolution simulations of the turbulent ism .",
    "they showed that the steady - state ion abundances at the end of their simulations can be out of equilibrium by several orders of magnitude at high mach numbers .",
    "if , as expected , we do not fully resolve such small - scale turbulence in our simulations , then we are likely to underestimate the importance of non - equilibrium chemistry .",
    "thirdly , chemical abundances can also be driven out of equilibrium by a fluctuating radiation field .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that the abundances of metal ions in the circumgalactic medium can be affected by the presence of an agn even after the agn has turned off , as it takes a long time for the ions to recombine . in our simulations",
    ", we apply a local prescription for self - shielding of the radiation field by gas and dust , which does vary with position and time .",
    "however , we apply the self - shielding to a constant , uniform radiation field . in reality",
    ", the uv radiation from young stars will fluctuate as new stars are born , existing stars age and gas particles move in relation to the stars .",
    "this may drive additional non - equilibrium effects that we do not capture in our current simulations .",
    "furthermore , since we have shown that uv radiation affects the global properties of galaxies , the inclusion of a fluctuating radiation field will also influence the galaxy directly , in addition to any non - equilibrium effects that it may drive .",
    "likewise , it will also be important to include fluctuations in metallicity due to chemical enrichment from stars , which are not included in the fixed - metallicity models that we present here .",
    "we are very grateful to volker springel for sharing gadget3 and his inital conditions code , and to claudio dalla vecchia for allowing us to use anarchy .",

    "<S> we present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the models use a resolution of @xmath1 per particle and include a treatment for the full non - equilibrium chemical evolution of ions and molecules ( 157 species in total ) , along with gas cooling rates computed self - consistently using the non - equilibrium abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these to simulations evolved using cooling rates calculated assuming chemical ( including ionisation ) equilibrium , and we consider a wide range of metallicities and uv radiation fields , including a local prescription for self - shielding by gas and dust . </S>",
    "<S> we find higher star formation rates and stronger outflows at higher metallicity and for weaker radiation fields , as gas can more easily cool to a cold ( few hundred kelvin ) star forming phase under such conditions . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to variations in the metallicity and the radiation field , non - equilibrium chemistry generally has no strong effect on the total star formation rates or outflow properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important for modelling molecular outflows . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mass of h@xmath2 outflowing with velocities @xmath3 is enhanced by a factor @xmath4 in non - equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the observable line emission from cii and co. both are stronger at higher metallicity , while cii and co emission are higher for stronger and weaker radiation fields respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cii is generally unaffected by non - equilibrium chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> however , emission from co varies by a factor of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for the mean @xmath6 conversion factor between co emission and h@xmath2 column density , which we find is lowered by up to a factor @xmath7 in non - equilibrium , and for the fraction of co - dark molecular gas .    </S>",
