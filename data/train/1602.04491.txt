    "asteroid families are the outcome of high - velocity collisions between asteroids .",
    "if the fragments of collisions have speeds exceeding the escape velocity from the parent body , they may be ejected and form a swarm around the main body ( or , in case of a catastrophic collision , around the family barycenter ) .",
    "since the terminal ejection speeds are only a fraction of the orbital speed of most main belt bodies , the fragments are not ejected far and may be identified by the fact that they form clusters in the domain of proper elements @xmath1 ( or proper frequencies @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a description of the methods used to obtain proper elements and frequencies ) , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the asteroids proper semi - major axis , eccentricity , and inclination , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the proper mean - motion , frequency of precession of the longitudes of pericenter , and of the node , respectively @xcite .",
    "theoretically , ejection speeds of asteroid family members could be estimated from the distribution in proper elements @xmath1 using gaussequations @xcite , provided that both the true anomaly and the argument of perihelion of the family parent body are known ( or estimated ) . in practice ,",
    "several gravitational and non - gravitational effects , such as resonant dynamics @xcite , close encounters with massive asteroids @xcite , and the yarkovsky effect @xcite can change proper elements of asteroid families , so that information on the original ejection speeds is sometimes lost , especially for older , more dynamically evolved groups .",
    "recently , however , @xcite , based on arguments on the current shape of the distribution in @xmath9 of the koronis family , suggested that information on the component of the ejection velocity that is perpendicular to the orbital plane ( @xmath0 ) may still be available for this family , at least in part   and @xmath5 distributions , such as for instance the datura and lorre clusters .",
    "here however we focus our attention on a relatively old family , to check whatever information may still available for more evolved groups . ] . in this work",
    "we extend the analysis of the previous paper , and try for the first time to obtain estimates of the original spread of the ejection velocity field for the koronis group , based on the _ eccentricity and inclination _ distributions , rather than on the semi - major axis one , as previously attempted @xcite . by performing long - term simulations of fictitious koronis members",
    ", we were able to evaluate the effect that dynamics may have had on the inclination distribution , and to estimate what the original distribution should have been , so allowing us to obtain a value of the spread in ejection speeds .",
    "this paper is so divided : in sect .",
    "[ sec : fam_ide ] we identify the koronis family and its halo , and we verify what is the current dispersion of the family in proper @xmath4 and @xmath10 . in sect .",
    "[ sec : loc_dyn ] we study the effect that the local dynamics may have had on the orbital evolution of koronis family members , and determine to which extent the original distribution in @xmath4 and @xmath10 have been preserved . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ej_field ] we estimate what was the original dispersion of the koronis family in proper inclination , determine how the spread in original inclination depended on the family members sizes , and estimate what was the magnitude of the family original ejection velocity field . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the koronis family is located in a relatively dynamically quiet region , where , with the exception of the @xmath11 secular resonance , a pericenter resonance that mostly modifies asteroid eccentricities , no other major mean - motion or secular resonance exists @xcite .",
    "the long - term dynamics of the koronis family should therefore had had a minor influence in the spreading in proper @xmath5 of members of the family , as we will also further investigate later on in this paper . despite being a relatively old family ( 2.65 gyr at most if one use standard values for the parameters describing the yarkovsky force @xcite , see @xcite and references therein for more detail on this age estimate ) , the current dispersion in proper @xmath5 of koronis family members could therefore still contain traces of information on the original ejection speeds @xcite .",
    "to investigate this hypothesis , we first obtained an estimate of the current family members .",
    "we used data published in @xcite for the koronis family using the hierarchical clustering method @xcite , and a velocity cutoff of 45 m / s in the @xmath1 domain ( see table 2 in @xcite for further details ) . since there are two subfamilies inside the koronis group , the karin cluster ( @xcite ) and the koronis 2 family @xcite , we eliminated these two subgroups from the list of koronis members .",
    "this left us with a sample of 5163 objects , out of the original 5949 members of the whole koronis and subfamilies sample .    to eliminate possible interlopers",
    ", we used the classification method of @xcite that employs sloan digital sky survey - moving object catalog data , fourth release ( sdss - moc4 hereafter , @xcite to compute @xmath12 slope and @xmath13 colors , and data from the three major photometric / spectroscopic surveys : ecas , eight - color asteroid analysis , @xcite , smass , small main belt spectroscopic survey , @xcite , and s3os2 , small solar system objects spectroscopic survey , @xcite .",
    "we obtained 896 observations in the sdss - moc4 catalog , and taxonomical information for 507 individual asteroids in the revised koronis family ( i.e. , the koronis family , less the two sub - families of karin and koronis 2 ) .",
    "we found 3 c - type , 8 d - type , 29 x - type , 109 l - type , 259 s - type , 98 k - type , and 1 a - type object , respectively .",
    "our results confirm the analysis of @xcite : the koronis family is an s - complex group , with a small percentage ( 40 objects , 7.9% of the available sample ) of c - complex interlopers .",
    "this is further confirmed by the values of geometric albedos @xmath14 from the wise mission @xcite for local asteroids . out of the 507 asteroids with taxonomical information ,",
    "284 have data in the wise dataset .",

    "rather then being a real characteristics of the koronis family , we believe that this is an artifact caused by the method used to identify the family in proper element domain . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ) may fail to identify the periphery , or halo , of some large families such as eos and koronis . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we used the sloan and wise data to identify objects in the vicinity of the hcm koronis family with a s - complex taxonomy .",

    "we are consistent with the method of other authors ( @xcite ) , that also did not considered populations of asteroids with @xmath30 km to avoid small - number statistics issues . for the sake of brevity , we will define the @xmath31 and @xmath17  km size bins as @xmath32 , and @xmath18 populations , respectively .",
    "we eliminated asteroids with proper @xmath33 au to avoid including objects that crossed the @xmath16 secular resonance and other local mean - motion resonances . to estimate the contribution of background objects to the sdss koronis family , following the approach of @xcite we counted the number of s - complex objects in boxes in the @xmath23 and @xmath34 planes , limited in @xmath3 by the 5j:-2a mean - motion resonance and @xmath15 au , and in @xmath4 and @xmath10 by the center of the distribution plus 4 @xmath35 values of the real family as the minimum value , and this quantity plus the length of the distribution in @xmath4 and @xmath10 of the real family as the maximum value .",

    "to better understand the importance of the local web of mean - motion and secular resonances , we obtained dynamical maps in the domain of synthetic proper @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the method of @xcite .",

    "no major secular resonances appear in the @xmath24 plane . in the @xmath23 plane , however , one can notice the strong effect of the @xmath47 secular resonance , that appears as an inclined band at @xmath48  au .",
    "to check if all important secular resonances were identified in the dynamical maps , we also computed the orbital location of all secular resonances whose combination of proper @xmath7 and @xmath8 is within the values covered by the koronis family , and checked the number of likely resonators @xcite for each resonance ( likely resonators are defined as the objects whose combination of asteroidal proper frequencies is within @xmath49 arcsec / yr from the resonance center . for the case of the @xmath50 resonance , this would correspond to @xmath51 arcsec / yr ; the actual threshold may vary for higher order resonances , but the 0.3 arcsec / yr boundary usually provide a good first order of magnitude criteria ) .",
    "not all likely resonators are in librating states , but the number of these objects may provide a first clue on the dynamical strength of each resonance .    table  [ table : sec_res ] shows the results for the two secular resonances with a number of likely resonators larger than 1 : the @xmath52 resonance , already described in the seminal paper of @xcite , and the @xmath53 @xmath54type resonance , that is near the 7j:-3a mean - motion resonance and has therefore a limited importance in affecting the dynamical evolution of the koronis group .",

    "we believe this is an acceptable trade - off . but explaining the current distribution in proper @xmath4 of the koronis family certainly remain a challenge for future research . a few particles interacted with the @xmath59 nodal resonance near the 7j:-3a mean - motion resonance and were scattered to higher values of inclination , as a result .    to compute how much local dynamics influenced the dispersion in proper @xmath4 and @xmath10 , we calculated the time behavior of the standard deviation of @xmath60 and @xmath61 $ ] for all 502 particles .",

    "it has been assumed that the spread of the original ejection velocity field ( and therefore of @xmath4 and @xmath9 , @xcite ) should actually be inversely proportional to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "here we show that this is actually the case for the koronis family .",
    "* we studied how the local dynamics may have affected the original distribution in proper @xmath4 and @xmath9 of the koronis family by obtaining dynamical maps of the koronis orbital region , and by performing numerical integrations of a fictitious family with the @xmath55 integrator of @xcite .",
    "local dynamics for the whole family affects more eccentricities than inclination : about all of the current spread in eccentricity could be caused by dynamical effects .",
    "conversely , up to 50% of the current spread in inclination can be original .",
    "* we estimated the original dispersion of the koronis family in proper eccentricity and inclination , assuming that changes caused by dynamical processes and by the initial velocity distribution can be summed as two independent random variables . estimated values of the @xmath57 parameter describing the initial spread of the koronis family should be of the order of 80 m / s , and compatible with what previously found with yarko - yorp methods to fit the koronis family semi - major axis distribution ( 70 m / s ) .",
    "overall , for the first time we obtained estimates of the @xmath57 parameter describing the initial spread of the koronis family using the _ inclination _ distribution , rather than the semi - major axis one , as previously attempted .",
    "our results suggests that i ) the initial spread in ejection velocity might indeed be inversely dependent on the asteroid sizes , as previously assumed by other authors @xcite , and ii ) values of @xmath57 could be compatible with what previously obtained by using yarko - yorp methods to fit the semi - major axis distribution of the koronis family . extending this analysis to other families identified in @xcite as good candidates for not being too much affected by dynamical evolution ,",
