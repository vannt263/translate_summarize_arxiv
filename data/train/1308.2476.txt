    "recent advanced solar observations suggest that plasmoids are ejected from reconnection sites in the solar corona both away and toward the sun during coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , or solar eruptions @xcite . stemming from these observations",
    ", we can assume that the cme s current sheet is not a single layer of enhanced current density , but it contains many fine structures within , including multiple reconnection x - points @xcite . since the majority of space plasma systems are collisionless , it is important to study the reconnection dynamics via the kinetic approach .",
    "the complexity of the underlying physics limits kinetic models and simulations of reconnection in these space environments to relatively small regions ( size of ion - inertia length ) , which are currently under resolved with the existing observational facilities .",
    "the collisional theory , however , can still be used in numerous space plasma physics circumstances in order to calculate the reconnection rate , as well as the rate at which the magnetic energy is dissipated .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) reconnection solutions exist where the rate of reconnection is largely independent of the magnitude of the electric resistivity @xcite . in physical circumstances high lundquist numbers ( @xmath4 ) , existing numerical simulations",
    "have already demonstrated that a single reconnecting current sheet can break up into multiple interacting reconnection sites even on the mhd scale @xcite .",
    "it was also found that , should the aspect ratio of the secondary current sheet exceed some critical value ( @xmath5 ) , then higher orders of magnetic islands ( or o - points ) and thinner current sheets begin to develop @xcite . as a result",
    ", the local value of current density at the x - points and the global reconnection rate can be increased significantly during the reconnection process involving plasmoid instabilities .",
    "this yields fast reconnection dynamics in the physical environment of the solar corona , as required to explain solar observations of flares and cmes .    in the majority of existing mhd numerical studies of plasmoid instabilities , for simplicity",
    ", the magnetic diffusivity coefficient is assumed to be either uniform , or a function of position . for collisional space plasma on the mhd scale",
    ", it is well established , however , that the magnetic diffusivity varies with the plasma temperature approximately as : @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "since the plasma temperature in reconnecting current sheets is generally not uniform ( varies with time and location ) , studying the reconnection process with a realistic , temperature - dependent magnetic diffusion is very important .",
    "furthermore , the effects of thermal conduction on the reconnection dynamics in current sheets have also been ignored in the existing numerical 2-d ( and 3-d ) mhd models .",
    "some previous studies , however , indicate that this term could be very important @xcite , should the temperature and its spatial gradient be high enough in the underlying physical environment , such as that of the solar corona .    in this paper , we investigate numerically the physical effects of temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity and anisotropic thermal conduction on the evolution of plasmoid instabilities in reconnecting current sheets in the low solar corona .",
    "we analyze in great detail the spatial and temporal evolution of the current density , magnetic flux , reconnection rate , and temperature structure of reconnecting current sheet during the development of plasmoid instability process .",
    "the energy conversion process is also studied in great length and compared in the cases with and without thermal conduction .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",

    "this is not true , however , for simulations that include the thermal conduction . from the expression of the heat conduction term , one can see that the physical values of the normalization units , along with the temperature gradient , determine the importance of this physical process .",

    "since the kinetic gas pressure is related to the magnetic pressure by @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the initial plasma @xmath65 at the @xmath17-boundary .",

    "the initial equilibrium mass density and temperature can be derived as : @xmath69    in order to trigger plasmoid instabilities in the current sheet , we impose small initial perturbations for the magnetic field of the kind : @xmath70 @xmath71 in our simulations , we used a constant value of @xmath72 .",
    "the introduced perturbation has a half - period in the @xmath17-direction and a full period in the @xmath20-direction .",
    "this type of perturbation yields the development of tearing - mode instabilities in the current sheet and it produces a large primary magnetic island .",
    "eventually , a much thinner sweet - parker - type current sheet develops , and secondary magnetic islands appear if the lundquist number is sufficiently large ( @xmath73 ) . in all our simulations",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath20-direction and neumann boundary conditions in the the @xmath17-direction .",
    "we have simulated five different physical scenarios ( models m0-m4 hereafter ) , which are discussed in this paper . in models m0 and m1 , the magnetic diffusivity is considered to be uniform everywhere . in models m2-m4 , the lundquist number scales with the temperature as @xmath74 .",
    "we choose @xmath75 in order to make the lundquist number sufficiently high to yield the occurrence secondary plasmoid instabilities in the current sheet . the heat conducting term is included in models m1 , m3 and m4 , and the choice of the normalization units affects the significance of thermal conduction in the these cases .",
    "table 1 summarizes the five different models .",

    "the magnetic field is of the order of @xmath79  t , and the mass density is around 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath80 , so that the value of @xmath81 in the real solar corona could be close to , or even greater than the value of @xmath82 calculated for all the models . for the choice of normalization units in cases m1 and m3",
    ", we find that the magnitude of the cross - field thermal conduction coefficient is around @xmath83 times smaller than the parallel one at the boundaries @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the thermal conduction , however , is nearly isotropic initially in the middle of the current sheet , because the magnetic field is weak there .",
    "we perform the simulations on a base - level cartesian grid of @xmath86 .",
    "the highest refinement level in our simulations is 10 , which corresponds to a grid resolution of @xmath87 . in order to ensure that this resolution is sufficient ,",
    "we have carried out convergence studies starting with twice lower resolution . in specific",
    ", we have tested the case m3 by setting the highest refinement level equal to 9 , which corresponds to a grid resolution of @xmath88 .",
    "we find that the reconnection rate is very similar in both the high and the low resolution run .",
    "in this paper , the time - dependent reconnection rate is defined as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the magnetic flux functions at the main reconnection @xmath0-point ( where the separatrices separating the two open field line regions intersect ) and the @xmath92-point . here , the magnetic flux function is defined through the relations : @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath92-point is always inside the primary island , and the corresponding @xmath91 is the minimum value of @xmath95 over the whole simulation domain . in the case when there are several @xmath0-points , the one which has the maximum value of @xmath95 dictates the reconnection rate .",
    "calculated this way , the reconnection rate is the global one over the entire reconnecting current sheet .    while analyzing the data , we find the following key observations .",
    "first , the temperature increases with time at the center of the current sheet , especially at the reconnection @xmath0-point in the beginning .",
    "since the plasma is ejected away from the @xmath0-point during the development of plasmoid instability process , an increasing amount of hot plasma gets trapped inside the magnetic islands .",
    "the location of maximum temperature is sometimes found not to be at the reconnection @xmath0-point , but inside the secondary islands .",
    "the temperature in the current sheet region , however , is always higher than in the inflow region .",
    "once can see this characteristic evolution of the temperature in fig .",
    "1 and fig .  2 .    for a temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity ( @xmath96 )",
    ", @xmath28 decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) illustrate the distributions of the current density and the magnetic flux at different time instants for the case of uniform magnetic diffusivity ( m0 ) , and the case of temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity ( m2 ) , respectively . since the initial temperature , @xmath97 ,",
    "is set to 0.1 in all the cases we have simulated here , the initial value of magnetic diffusivity is the same in all cases . as the plasmoid instability develops with time in the case m2 , the magnetic diffusivity inside the current sheet decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this makes the initial thick harris sheet evolve into a thinner sweet - parker current sheet , when compared with the m0 case ( with uniform magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "there also appear more secondary islands and thinner secondary current sheets in the case m2 than in the case m0 .",
    "the maximum current density at the @xmath0-point in the case m2 can increase to higher values during the secondary instabilities . at the same time , however , the reconnection rate and the maximum temperature in the simulation domain are somewhat smaller than in the case m0 .",
    "these key observations can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "3(a ) , fig .",
    "3(b ) , fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "according to the normalization units chosen for cases m1 and m3 , the ion - inertia length is calculated to be around @xmath98  m in these models .",
    "the narrowest width of the secondary current sheets can reach around 0.001 in our simulations , which corresponds to @xmath99  m in the real space .",
    "this is much greater than the ion - inertia length , meaning that our simulations are in the collisional regime .",
    "therefore , the adopted form of temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity is well justified in our models .    in the following",
    "we discuss the physical effects of thermal conduction on the development of the plasmoid instabilities .",
    "the numerical results for the reconnection rate , the current density distribution , the temperature distribution , and the energy conversion are presented and compared for the cases with and without thermal conduction .    in the case with uniform magnetic diffusivity ( m1 )",
    ", the heat conduction ( see table 1 for characteristic parameters ) does not affect significantly the evolution of the plasmoid instability .",
    "the reconnection rate , the distribution of the current density , and the magnetic field structure at each time step for the case m1 are very similar to those for the case m0 .",
    "the cases m2 , m3 , and m4 have the same form of magnetic diffusivity , which evolves with temperature as @xmath3 .",
    "the thermal conduction term , however , is switched on only in cases m3 and m4 ( and turned off for m2 ) .",
    "also , the normalization units are the same in the cases m1 and m3 , unlike the case m4 where the normalization units for magnetic field strength and mass density are chosen smaller .",
    "this makes the value of @xmath82 greater in the case m4 than in the cases m1 and m3 , which is why the thermal conduction effects more pronounced in the former .",
    "we find that the spatial and temporal evolution of the current density and the magnetic flux to be almost identical for the cases m2-m4 prior to the occurrence of secondary magnetic islands . as the plasma temperature and its gradient increase in the current sheet during secondary instability processes ,",
    "the heat conduction effects become more pronounced in the case m4 than in the other cases .",
    "as far as the time - dependent current - sheet structure and reconnection rate are concerned , one can see in fig .",
    "3(b ) and fig .",
    "3(c ) that the secondary current sheets are thinner in the case m3 than in the case m2 at the same time instant .",
    "we also find that in the former case the maximum current density at the reconnection @xmath0-point increases up to a value is twice greater than in the latter case .",
    "4(a ) reveals that the reconnection rate is also almost twice greater in the case m3 than in the case m2 during the later stages of the secondary instability process . in the case of m4",
    ", the reconnection rate can increase to an even higher value compared to the cases m2-m3 . as seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , when there are secondary plasmoids present in the current sheet , the temperature distribution along the current sheet is not smooth anymore , and there are several temperature peaks inside the secondary plasmoids .",
    "this makes the temperature gradients along the current sheet become large enough to render the heat conduction important .",
    "this leads to a further increase in the reconnection rate , as seen in the case of m4 .    in order to demonstrate the significance of thermal conduction",
    ", we calculate the characteristic time - scale of heat conduction , @xmath100 along the current sheet in the case m3 at @xmath101 . here , @xmath102 is the thermal energy density , @xmath33 is the field - aligned thermal conduction coefficient , and @xmath103 is the second derivative of plasma temperature .",
    "we find that @xmath104 is significantly shorter ( @xmath105 ) than the alfvn crossing time at the reconnection @xmath0-point locations , as well as the @xmath92-point locations than elsewhere in the current sheet",
    ". note , however , that at the locations of the @xmath92-points the temperature gradient is across the magnetic field , meaning that it is @xmath34 that determines the @xmath104 in the above expression . since @xmath106",
    ", the thermal conduction will be inefficient in getting heat out of the plasmoids , hence their plasma temperature will grow in time . when comparing the cases with and without thermal conduction , we find that the significance of this process is in lowering the plasma temperature ( and heat content ) at the locations of the @xmath1points , while increasing the temperature ( and heat content ) of the adjacent plasmoids ( or the @xmath2point locations ) .",
    "the drop in temperature at the locations of the @xmath1points means higher value of the magnetic diffusion coefficient ( @xmath107 ) there , hence : ( i ) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy ; and , ( ii ) enhanced reconnection rate , as in the case m4 .",
    "we find that in the temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity cases , the plasma temperature increases from 0.1 ( initially ) to around 0.25 inside the current sheet region , which leads to a decrease in the magnetic diffusivity by a factor of 4 from its initial value of @xmath108 down to @xmath109 .",
    "as the temperature rises at the locations of the @xmath1points , however , the effects of thermal conduction increase , leading to a drop in plasma temperature on a characteristic time - scale of @xmath104 , which is shorter than the characteristic time of magnetic diffusion , @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 is the characteristic size of the diffusion region ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the drop in temperature at the @xmath1points results in an enhanced @xmath28 therein which , in turn , leads to a decrease in @xmath112 .",
    "this negative - feedback - loop proceeds until @xmath112 becomes comparable with @xmath104 , which is achieved at enhanced values of @xmath28 .",
    "this ultimately leads to an enhanced reconnection rate at the @xmath1points due to the presence of thermal conduction .",
    "this is also the reason why the thermal conduction is more effective in the case m3 with temperature - dependent resistivity than in the case m1 with uniform resistivity .",
    "the time - dependent temperature distributions in the cases m2 and m3 are found to be different during the later stages of the secondary instability process .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "1(b ) , fig .",
    "1(c ) , fig .",
    "2(a ) , and fig .",
    "2(b ) that the plasma temperature distributions inside the current sheet for these two cases are almost identical prior to the secondary islands appearance . from the discussion above , the appearance of secondary islands enhances the effects of thermal conduction , as in the case m3 , which makes the temperature distribution along the current sheet different than that in the case without thermal conduction ( case m2 ) .",
    "the first and the second plots from left to right in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) reveal the temperature distribution for the case m2 and the case m3 , respectively , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in these figures , one can see that the hot plasma trapped in the primary plasmoid is more spread out in the @xmath17-direction ( at the same @xmath20 location ) in the case m3 than in the case m2 at @xmath114 .",
    "the third plots to the right in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) show the temperature distribution in the @xmath17-direction at @xmath115 for the case m2 and the case m3 , respectively . during the time period from @xmath116 to @xmath114 ,",
    "the highest temperature region spreads out in the @xmath17-direction to a larger extent in the case m3 than in the case m2 .",
    "this is because a thermal , front - like structure propagates away from the center - line of the current sheet along the x - axis in the case m3 .",
    "the enhanced heat content ( and plasma pressure ) inside the plasmoid ( more enhanced in the case m3 than in the case m2 due to the heat conduction ) causes a new pressure balance to be reached at a greater width of the plasmoid in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "note here that we have utilized anisotropic thermal conduction in the models discussed here , and the cross - field conduction coefficient ( @xmath34 ) is much smaller than the field - aligned conduction coefficient ( @xmath33 ) inside the entire current sheet .",
    "we find that @xmath34 is comparable in value to @xmath33 ( and hence isotropic ) only inside a narrow region ranging from @xmath117 to @xmath118 where the magnetic field is negligible .",
    "the width of this region is even more narrower that the width of the secondary current sheets that are present in our models .",
    "therefore , the heat conduction is anisotropic almost everywhere in the simulation domain , and it changes the distribution of plasma temperature only along the magnetic field .",
    "this is the reason why the heat can not be conducted away in the direction perpendicular to the current sheet .    in order to quantify the differences between the cases with ( m3 ) and without ( m2 ) thermal conduction during the development of plasmoid instabilities , we calculate the various energy contents ( and fluxes ) inside the region given by : @xmath119 and @xmath120 . due to the non - vanishing energy fluxes through the boundaries at @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,",
    "the total magnetic , thermal , and kinetic energy inside this region changes in time during the plasmoid instability process .",
    "the magnetic , thermal , and kinetic energy flowing into this region through the boundaries at @xmath121 and @xmath122 from the beginning of the simulation ( @xmath123 ) to time @xmath124 is denoted as @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "( note that these quantities may have negative signs if energy flows out of the region . )",

    "the first part comes from the inward enthalpy flux through the boundaries at @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the second part comes from the thermal conduction effects in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "the integral calculations of the different types of energy fluxes have been performed in idl .",
    "we have doubled the spatial and temporal resolutions to check the results and make sure that they have converged . in fig .",
    "6(a ) we show the time - dependent evolution of the different kinds of energy fluxes through the @xmath17-boundaries .",
    "one can see that a substantial amount of magnetic energy flows into the region during the period from @xmath123 to @xmath146 during the development of the plasmoid instability process . on the contrary",
    ", we find that a relatively smaller amount of thermal and kinetic energy have flown into the region for the same time period . fig .",
    "6(b ) reveals that the thermal energy conducted out of this region in the @xmath17-direction due to the thermal conduction can be ignored in the case m3 .",
    "the thermal energy flux in the @xmath17-direction is basically brought in by the enthalpy flux from the inflow region .",
    "fig.7(a ) , fig.7(b ) , and fig.7(c ) visualize the time - evolution of the dissipated magnetic energy , the generated thermal energy , and the generated kinetic energy , respectively , for the cases m2 and m3 . in these figures , one can see that the dissipated magnetic energy is not always increasing with time , but it decreases slightly from @xmath147 to @xmath148 .",
    "that is because the advection of magnetic flux from the inflow region is more dominant that the dissipation of magnetic flux during this time period , which leads to the slight increase in magnetic energy during this time period .",
    "we find that the generated thermal energy increases monotonically with time during the secondary instability process .",
    "the generated kinetic energy is much less than the generated thermal energy during the entire instability process , and we find that the former is not always increasing with time . in the cases m2 and m3 there are several peaks in the kinetic energy from @xmath149 to @xmath150 , with the maximum peak reached at around @xmath151 ( before the secondary instabilities occur ) .",
    "therefore , there is more kinetic energy generated during the primary tearing instability process than during the secondary instability process . in other words ,",
    "some portion of the generated kinetic energy has been converted to other forms of energy ( thermal ) after @xmath151 .",
    "the magnetic energy is found to be dissipated faster in the case m3 than in the case m2 during the later stages of the secondary instability process .",
    "there is also more thermal energy generated in the case m3 than in the case m2 during the advanced stages of secondary instabilities .",
    "the secondary peaks seen in the case m3 are more pronounced ( higher amplitude ) than in the case m2 .",
    "although approximately 99% of the magnetic energy has been eventually transformed into thermal energy , we find that the energy conversion process during the development of the plasmoid instabilities is rather complex .",
    "another key result is that there has been more magnetic energy transformed into thermal and kinetic energy in the case m3 than in the case m2 , because the reconnection rate is higher in the former ( see discussion above ) .",
    "this demonstrates once again that the thermal conduction acts to accelerates the reconnection rate during the plasmoid instabilities process .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the physical effects of temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity and anisotropic thermal conduction on the dynamics of plasmoid instabilities in reconnecting current sheets in the environment of the solar corona .",
    "we have conducted five numerical experiments in 2-d mhd systems , as presented in table  1 .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are summarized below .",
    "first , we have found that the plasma temperature in the current sheet region increases with time and it becomes greater than that in the inflow region .",
    "second , as secondary magnetic islands appear , the highest temperature is not always found at the reconnection @xmath0-points , but also inside the secondary islands .",
    "one of the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction is to decrease the temperature of the reconnecting @xmath1points and transfer the heat into the @xmath2points , the plasmoids , where it gets trapped .",
    "third , in the cases with temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath96 , the decrease in plasma temperature at the @xmath1points leads to : ( i ) increase in the magnetic diffusivity until the characteristic time for magnetic diffusion becomes comparable to that of thermal conduction ; ( ii ) increase in the reconnection rate ; and , ( iii ) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy and kinetic energy of bulk motions .",
    "these results provide further explanation of the rapid release of magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy seen during flares and cmes .",
    "we conclude that the consideration of anisotropic thermal conduction and spitzer - type , temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity , as in the real solar corona , are crucially important for explaining the occurrence of fast reconnection during solar eruptions .    we have also investigated the energy budget of the reconnecting current sheets during the primary and the secondary instability processes .",
    "we have found that the magnetic energy is converted more efficiently into thermal and kinetic energy during the later stages of secondary instability process , and that the conversion process is rather complex then .    in the future",
    ", we would like to implement open boundary conditions in the @xmath20-direction along the current sheet , and to introduce a guide field in the third dimension .",
    "the former is necessary in order to let the heat flow leave through boundary without being reflected back in .",
    "the inclusion of guide magnetic field is also important , because it will enable us to investigate how the heat trapped inside the plasmoids ( @xmath92-points ) is carried away by the thermal conduction in the direction of the guide field .",
    "this type of study was not possible in the current version of the models .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate , by means of two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations , the impact of temperature - dependent resistivity and thermal conduction on the development of plasmoid instabilities in reconnecting current sheets in the solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the plasma temperature in the current sheet region increases with time and it becomes greater than that in the inflow region . </S>",
    "<S> as secondary magnetic islands appear , the highest temperature is not always found at the reconnection @xmath0-points , but also inside the secondary islands . </S>",
    "<S> one of the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction is to decrease the temperature of the reconnecting @xmath1points and transfer the heat into the @xmath2points , the plasmoids , where it gets trapped . in the cases with temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity , @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in plasma temperature at the @xmath1points leads to : ( i ) increase in the magnetic diffusivity until the characteristic time for magnetic diffusion becomes comparable to that of thermal conduction ; ( ii ) increase in the reconnection rate ; and , ( iii ) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy and kinetic energy of bulk motions . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide further explanation of the rapid release of magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy seen during flares and coronal mass ejections . in this work , we demonstrate that the consideration of anisotropic thermal conduction and spitzer - type , temperature - dependent magnetic diffusivity , as in the real solar corona , are crucially important for explaining the occurrence of fast reconnection during solar eruptions . </S>"
