    "recent advances in the manipulation of nanostructures have enabled the fabrication of reduced - dimensional quantum systems with novel geometry @xcite .",
    "the understanding of their basic properties and the accurate modeling of their electronic structures are of vital importance for the manufacture of nanodevices and their applications . from the theoretical viewpoints ,",
    "the peculiar features exhibited by quantum systems confined to low - dimensional curved geometry are of interest .",
    "these peculiarities arise from an interplay between geometry and quantum physics ; in fact , when the electron is strongly confined to a smoothly curved surface , it experiences an effective potential energy whose magnitude depends on the local curvatures along the surface @xcite . due to this curvature effect",
    ", the electrons can not move around freely on the surface even in the absence of impurities or other interacting entities .",
    "this implies that the quantum transport of low - dimensional nanostructures can be controlled by altering the local geometric curvature .    in the present work",
    ", we theoretically investigate the curvature effect on the quantum properties of electrons confined to a cylindrical surface .",
    "the local deformation of the cylindrical surface significantly affected the spatial profile of the electron eigenstates in the lowest - energy region .",
    "this indicates the occurrence of a curvature - induced alteration in the ballistic electron transport in nanoscale cylindrical surfaces .",
    "in quantum mechanics , the motion of quantum particles constrained to a two - dimensional curved surface is described by one of the two formalisms given below .",
    "one is the intrinsic quantization approach , in which the motion is constrained to the surface a priori ; namely , a classical hamiltonian is firstly constructed from coordinates and momentum intrinsic to the surface , following which the system is quantized canonically .",
    "the other is the confining potential approach , in which the particle is assumed to be confined by a strong force that acts normal to the curved surface . in this approach , the quantization of the motion perpendicular to the curved surface results in an effective potential that depends on the local surface curvature . among the two formalisms , we employ the latter one since it offers a physically more realistic model of quantum confinement to curved surfaces .",
    "( in fact , in any real physical system , constrained motion is the result of a strong confining force . )",
    "it is mentioned that the confining potential approach was initially suggested by da costa @xcite ; it has been successfully applied to quantum mechanical problems involving novel geometries @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a three - dimensional curvilinear coordinate .",
    "this allows the parameterization of a curved surface of interest by @xmath1 .",
    "then , a point @xmath2 in this space can be determined through the relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector normal to the curved surface .",
    "we now introduce a confining potential @xmath5 . after a proper limiting procedure @xcite",
    ", the potential becomes @xmath6 if @xmath7 and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "this allows us to separate the @xmath9 dependence in the hamiltonian of the confined system and eventually provides the schrdinger equation for curved surfaces : @xmath10 \\sigma = e\\sigma , \\label{eq02}\\ ] ] where , @xmath11 \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad g^{ij } = [ g_{ij}]^{-1}.\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "the occurrence of the non - trivial potential term , @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) , is a direct consequence of the quantization of the motion normal to the surface .",
    "it is emphasized that this potential term depends only on the local surface geometry and not on the mass or charge of the particle .",

    "it is noteworthy that , due to the rotational symmetry of the surfaces , the schrdinger equation ( [ eq02 ] ) can be further simplified by means of the variable - separation method .",
    "this is seen by substituting @xmath23 into eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) , with the definition @xmath24 then , we obtain the reduced schrdinger equation for @xmath25 as @xmath26 = \\epsilon \\eta(z ) , \\label{eq06}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 + h(z)^2-d(z)-\\frac{m^2}{r(z)^2 } , \\label{eq07}\\ ] ] and @xmath28 consequently , the problem is reduced to solving the differential equatioin ( 8) with respect to @xmath29 . by observing the @xmath22- and @xmath17- dependences of @xmath29 , we can clarify the curvature effect on the electronic structures of deformed cylindrical surfaces .      in the actual calculations in eq .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) , we have employed the tight - binding approximation ; i.e. , the continuous variable @xmath16 is discretized into a set of discrete numbers @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) with an equiseparation @xmath32 . the resulting difference equation is @xmath33 where the constant @xmath34 denotes the hopping energy between neighboring sites in an undeformed region .",
    "nonzero surface curvature at the deformed region manifest itself in spatial modulation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 given in eq .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 and @xmath38 if the cylinder in question is flat ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the differential equation ( 13 ) applies to real deformed cylindrical nanosurfaces in which the surface density of constituents ( atoms or molecules ) is homogeneous over the whole surface . in other words ,",
    "the separation @xmath40 of neighboring constituents needs to assume nearly constant so that the hopping energy remains to be constant .",
    "this condition , however , may violate when an external deformation against the original flat cylindrical surface is magnified . in the latter case ,",
    "deformation - induced change in @xmath40 can be taken into account by rewriting eq .",

    "( 14 ) reduces to eq .",

    "hence , by examining the dependence of @xmath56 on the geometric parameters @xmath22 and @xmath17 , we obtain an understanding of the geometric effect on the electron system on cylindrical surfaces .",

    "( 13 ) ) , while in the two right panels , the spatial variation of @xmath42 is taken into account ( see eq .",
    "henceforth , we refer to the two models described by eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) as models a and model b , respectively .",
    "we see from the four panels that the ground - state eigenfunction may be strongly bounded ( dark region ) or may extend over the entire system ( light region ) depending on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "we first consider the result of model a ; it is evident that in both the cases of @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "2(a ) ) and @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) , the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath56 is completely different in the regions @xmath18 ( bulging deformation ) and @xmath19 ( constricted deformation ) . with @xmath52 , for instance , @xmath56 for @xmath18 tends to increase with @xmath22 and eventually becomes equal to the system length @xmath50 at @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates that the ground - state becomes extended ( @xmath59 ) when reforming the bulging part to be more stretched in the direction of the @xmath16-axis . on the other hand , @xmath56 for @xmath19",
    "is almost invariant with regard to changes in @xmath22 , and its value is always smaller than @xmath50 . as summarized , ( i ) the crossover behaviour of @xmath56 from the bounded to extended states",
    "is observed only in the case of bulging deformation ( @xmath18 ) , and within this range , ( ii ) the magnitude of @xmath56 for a fixed @xmath17 rapidly increases at @xmath60 .",
    "these two findings suggest the possibility of controlling the ballistic electron transport in cylindrical nanostructures by introducing a subtle geometric deformation .    a similar crossover behaviour of @xmath56 was observed in the case of @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast to the case of @xmath52 , the crossover occurs for negative @xmath17 , not for positive .",
    "in fact , we have confirmed that when @xmath61 , the extended low - energy states occur only at @xmath62 , which is in contrast to the case of @xmath52 , where the extended states occur only at @xmath63 .",
    "this difference as well as the global behavior of @xmath64 depicted in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(c ) can be accounted for by considering the contribution from each term in the expression for @xmath65 ( see eq .  ( 9 ) ) ; detailed analyses will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    while the localization length @xmath56 in the model a is responsive to the variations of @xmath22 and @xmath17 , that in model b exhibits only a slight dependence on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) for @xmath52 and fig .",
    "2(d ) for @xmath53 .",
    "in both cases , @xmath56 decreases rather slowly with an increase @xmath22 and @xmath17 , which implies that a geometric deformation has almost no contribution to determining the spatial profiles of the eigenstates .       of the ground - state with @xmath52 for model",

    "3(c)-(f ) , where @xmath54 is taken as units of energy .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) that the wavefunction for model a is extended at @xmath68 , whereas it is spatially bounded around the deformed region ( @xmath69 ) at @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , this behavior is completely consistent with the contour plot of @xmath56 depicted in fig .",
    "in contrast , the wavefunction corresponding to model b exhibits almost no variance in its spatial profile for a different value of @xmath22 ; it is fairly extended along the @xmath16-axis with a low ( almost negligible ) amplitude around the deformed region .    the disappearance of the bound state in model b is qualitatively understood by observing the @xmath16-dependence of the off - diagonal elements @xmath71 , as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) . in both plots , double - well structures",
    "whose bottoms are located at @xmath72 appear .",
    "it is noteworthy that the magnitude of the double well of model b is larger than that of model a. this is because in the model b , the value of the hopping energy @xmath42 at @xmath72 becomes smaller than @xmath54 , since the separation @xmath40 becomes larger than @xmath32 ( see eq .",
    "then , the quantum hopping across point @xmath73 is slightly weak ; thus , the wavefunction in model b tends to have a finite amplitude only within the undeformed region ( @xmath74 ) in order to make the energy lower . as a consequence , the geometric deformation in model b neither engenders spatially bounded eigenstates as done in model a nor contributes significantly to the spatial profile of the lowest - energy eigenstates",
    "this scenario indicates that the low - energy bound states observed in model a are difficult to realize by inducing an external mechanical deformation to a flat cylindrical conducting surface .",
    "we emphasize that the abovementioned findings regarding model b serve as a complementary result to the existing studies of the geometric effect on the electron transport in cylindrical surfaces , where the geometric conditions to realize the bound states were considered @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effect of local geometric deformation on the electronic states that are strongly confined to a thin cylindrical surface .",
    "the spatial profile of the square amplitude of the lowest - energy eigenstates were numerically evaluated by the tight - binding approach ; this was followed by the extraction the localization length of the eigenstate as a function of the geometric parameters @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "the results indicate that , under certain conditions , a subtle geometric deformation could induce a drastic change in the ballistic electron transport along nanoscale cylindrical surfaces .",
