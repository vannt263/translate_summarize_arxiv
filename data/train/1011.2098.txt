    "it has been known since the advent of mathematical optics @xcite that lenses with certain curvature and/or a spatially varying refractive index allow for focussed images .",
    "indeed , the simplest example of a convergent lens is a curved piece of silica which bends light according to the snell - descartes laws of refraction at curved air / glass interface .",
    "however , such a lens is necessarily of a convex shape . on the contrary",
    ", a medium with a continuously changing refractive index can act as a flat convergent lens : gradient - index optics is indeed the branch of optics covering optical effects produced by a gradual variation of the refractive index of a material with the famous paradigm of the maxwell fisheye , first published by james clerck maxwell in 1854 under the pseudonym of charles anthony swainson @xcite , but however still of current interest @xcite .",
    "a continuously refracting index can also create optical illusions known as mirages : in the desert , these are due to the variation of refractive index between the hot , less dense air at the surface of the road , and the denser cool air above it .",
    "the variation in temperature ( and thus density ) of the air actually causes a gradient in its refractive index , causing it to increase with height .",
    "this index gradient causes anomalous refraction of light rays ( at a shallow angle to the road ) from the sky , bending them into eye of the viewer , with their apparent location being the road s surface .",
    "similar effects occur at the surface of the sea , and are known as fata morgana , after the name of the fairy in the arthurian legend who lifted castles over lakes .",
    "inverted optics include perfect lenses via negative refraction @xcite , that can also be designed using transformational optics by mapping the image plane onto the source plane , which causes a negative ( possibly spatially varying ) refractive index @xcite .",
    "maybe the most stricking example of an optical illusion is the invisibility cloak independently proposed by pendry , schurig and smith , and leonhardt @xcite , which can steer light around an object which is then invisible to an external observer ( however , light emanating from this object is itself confined within the invisibility cloak ! ) .",
    "the underlying mechanism of such cloaks relies upon a mirage effect , since a source located inside the coating seems to radiate from a shifted location @xcite .",
    "this coating actually consists of a meta - material whose physical properties are deduced from a coordinate transformation in the maxwell system , and this viewpoint allows for a refreshed analysis of geodesics of light in complex media , since the maxwell equations retain their form under geometric changes and the only thing to do in the transformed coordinates is to replace the original medium ( often isotropic homogeneous ) by an anisotropic heterogeneous medium @xcite ( a meta - material ) .",
    "such geometric transforms are very useful in computational electromagnetism to model unbounded @xcite and twisted @xcite domains in the context of optical fibres .",
    "however , the physical interest in transformational optics has been fuelled by potential applications in the design of meta - materials , while the electrical engineering community has used geometric transforms as a mean to simplify numerical models involving large or thin domains for the past thirty years .",
    "coming back to the invisibility cloak , the anisotropy and the heterogeneity of the parameters of its coat work as a deformation of the optical space around the object .",
    "the first experimental validation @xcite of these theoretical considerations was given , a few months after the proposals of pendry et al . , and leonhardt were released in the press .",
    "a copper cylinder was indeed made invisible to an incident plane wave at @xmath0 ghz as predicted by the numerical simulations .",
    "this markedly enhance our capabilities to manipulate light , even in the extreme near field limit @xcite .",
    "however , such cloaks suffer from an inherent narrow bandwidth as their transformation optics design leads to singular tensors on the frontier of the invisibility region which is a consequence of tearing apart the metric when one makes a hole in optical space ( obtained by blowing up a point @xcite ) .",
    "physically , light has to curve its trajectory around the hole ( or invisibility region ) ; hence , to match the phase of a wave propagating in homogeneous space , it must travel faster . to remove the cloak s singularity , xiang et al . proposed to consider the blowup of a segment instead of a point @xcite , but this cloak only works for certain directions .",
    "on the other hand , leonhardt and tyc considered a stereographic projection of a virtual hyper - sphere in a four dimensional space @xcite , which bears some resemblance with the construction of a maxwell fisheye .",
    "as an alternative to non - singular cloaking li and pendry proposed a one - to - one geometric transform from a flat to a curved ground : their invisibility carpet @xcite is by essence non singular and thus broadband .",
    "this proposal led to a rapid experimental progress in the construction of two - dimensional carpets approaching optical frequencies @xcite .    another way to make",
    "cloaks broadband is to approximate their parameters using a homogenization approach , which leads to nearly ideal cloaking @xcite , as it does not rely upon locally resonant elements . in 2008 ,",
    "some of us @xcite demonstrated broadband cloaking of transverse electric waves using a micro - structured metallic cloak in the micro - wave regime .",
    "this naturally prompts the question of whether , at optical frequencies , an object lying onto a metal film could be cloaked from a propagating surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) .",
    "the less than usual physics of the transmission of light through holes small compared with the wavelength is has given rise to a vast amount of literature following the 1998 paper by ebbesen et al .",
    "@xcite , but some heralding earlier work combining both theory and experiment is less well known @xcite .",
    "martin - moreno and garcia - vidal further showed in 2004 that one can manipulate surface plasmon ad libitum via homogenization of structured surfaces @xcite . in the same vein , pioneering approaches to invisibility relying upon plasmonic metamaterials have already led to fascinating results @xcite .",
    "these include plasmonic shells with a suitable out - of - phase polarizability in order to compensate the scattering from the knowledge of the electromagnetic parameters of the object to be hidden , and external cloaking , whereby a plasmonic resonance cancels the external field at the location of a set of electric dipoles .",
    "recently , baumeier et al . have demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that it is possible to reduce significantly the scattering of an object by a spp , when it is surrounded by two concentric rings of point scatterers @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we would like to extend the control of electromagnetic fields using tools of geometric transforms to the area of surface plasmons . to do this , we adopt the general form for the time - harmonic electric and magnetic field , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the angular frequency and @xmath6 is the time variable .",
    "we then consider the time - harmonic maxwell s equations in the initial space coordinates ( x , y , z ) :    @xmath7    where the tensors of permittivity and permeability @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the original ( possibly heterogeneous anisotropic ) medium .    in the transformed coordinate system ( u , v , w )",
    ", the structure of the maxwell equations is preserved :    @xmath10    but we note that the space derivatives are now taken with respect to the transformed coordinates ( hence , the transformed gradient @xmath11 ) , and obviously the permittivity and permeability tensors @xmath12 and @xmath13 should have new expressions .",
    "an elegant way to identify the tensors is to consider the jacobian matrix @xmath14 associated with the change of co - ordinate system :    @xmath15    it follows that @xcite the transformation rule for the tensors is : @xmath16 with :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the determinent of the jacobian matrix .",
    "when the original permittivity and permeability matrices are scalar , their transformed counterparts are given by : @xmath19    we now wish to apply this general rule to the case of a transverse magnetic ( @xmath20-polarized ) spp propagating in the positive @xmath21 direction at the interface @xmath22 between metal ( @xmath23 ) and air ( @xmath24 ) : @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath27 has the usual drude form in the metal(@xmath23 ) , for which @xmath28 is the plasma frequency ( @xmath29 thz ) of the _ free electron gas _ and @xmath30 is a characteristic collision frequency of about @xmath31 thz @xcite .",
    "moreover , the upper medium is described by spatially varying tensors of permittivity @xmath12 and permeability @xmath13 which for simplicity are assumed to be represented in a diagonal basis i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the surface polariton at such an anisotropic interface takes the following form @xcite @xmath34 spps are bound to the interface , hence do not belong to the radiative spectrum ( unlike leaky waves ) .",
    "in the present section we show numerically that one can control the spp field using transformational plasmonics .",
    "a review of transformations leading to arbitrary carpets , concentrators and rotators is presented .",
    "so far , such a mathematical derivation of the spp dispersion relation seems fairly abstract .",
    "however , we now wish to analyse the interaction of this spp with a specific anisotropic heterogeneous structure , in the present case a three - dimensional invisibility carpet @xcite , deduced from the following geometric transformation :    @xmath35    importantly , we note that this material is not only heterogeneous anisotropic but also magnetic , which seems a far technological reach .",
    "however , these constraints can be further relaxed using some quasi - conformal grids in the spirit of li and pendry s work for two - dimensional carpets @xcite .",
    "here @xmath36 is a stretched coordinate .",
    "it is easily seen that this linear geometric transform maps the surface @xmath37 of the horizontal plan @xmath38 onto the surface @xmath39 , and it leaves the surface @xmath40 unchanged .",
    "the surfaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assumed to be differentiable , and this ensures that the carpet wo nt display any singularity on its inner boundary .    the symmetric tensors @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fully described by five non vanishing entries in a cartesian basis :    [ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and with @xmath45 the jacobian matrix of the transformation .",
    "furthermore , the derivatives of @xmath46 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by : @xmath49 the purpose of the next section is to show that such carpets work equally well for electromagnetic and plasmonic fields , as is intuitively the case when looking at the limit of ray optics , see figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] : this is due to the fact that the transformed medium is valid for any field solution of the maxwell s equations ( which is obviously the case for spps ) .",
    "[ fig3a ]    we now wish to apply the recipe for the design of 3d carpets to specific geometrical transformations in order to hide gaussian and conical shaped bumps on a metallic surface .",
    "we first present the projection of the conical surface on the flat surface , as this case is more intuitive .",
    "the geometric transform used in such a design is as follows : @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    we report in figure [ fig3a ] the finite element computations which exemplify the role played by the carpet in the control of the spp wavefront .",
    "[ fig3b ]    we now present the projection of the conical surface on the flat surface , as this case is less intuitive . for this , we consider two surfaces @xmath41 and @xmath42 which describe the inner and outer boundaries of the carpet : @xmath53    explicit expressions for the partial derivatives are @xmath54    we report the finite element computations in figure [ fig3b ] .",
    "we can see that control of electromagnetic and plasmonic fields is achieved for both the smooth ( gaussian ) and rough ( conical shaped ) bumps .",
    "we emphasize that these numerical results are non - intuitive as the scattering by a conical shaped surface is one of the hardest cases to handle . in order to see this ,",
    "let us remind some classical result of singularity theory for a sector ( the two - dimensional counterpart of a conical shaped domain ) .",
    "let us consider the laplace problem in a semi - infinite sector bounded by two edges @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 which we can express in polar coordinates : @xmath58 and let us assume that dirichlet boundary conditions on the edges @xmath59 .",
    "using separation of variables , we find that @xmath60    it is well - known @xcite that if @xmath61 is square integrable , then @xmath62 is of finite energy , that is @xmath63    therefore , we need to ensure that the following expressions are finite : @xmath64 @xmath65    we note that @xmath66 is finite if and only if @xmath67 . this condition is not met for @xmath68 .",
    "hence , all coefficients @xmath69 vanish in ( [ fousect ] ) .",
    "the solution of the dirichlet problem is thus given by : @xmath70    from this expression , we can see that the field @xmath62 is singular near the tip of the sector i.e. when @xmath71 is close to zero .",
    "similar expresions hold for a conical shaped region in the three - dimensional case .",
    "however , when the sector / conical shaped region is filled with an heterogeneous anisotropic medium ( for instance deduced from a geometric transform ) , the laplace problem reads as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a matrix - valued function .",
    "the solution @xmath62 is now very different from above , and its behaviour around the tip of the sector / conical shaped region therefore changes dramatically .",
    "this simple analysis exemplifies the role of the transformed medium in the regularization of the field scattered by a conical shaped bump surrounded by a carpet .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that we can also launch a spp on a cylindrical surface using the transformational optics approach in order to guide smoothly the spp which propagates on a flat metal surface to the top of a cylindrical bump lying on the surface .",
    "more precisely , the transformed medium consists of two parts : on one hand , the quarter of a sphere ( shown in pink color in figure [ fig4 ] ) requires the following transform : @xmath74    on the other hand , the cylindrical part ( shown in yellow color in figure [ fig4 ] ) requires the following transform : @xmath75    we depict in figure [ fig4 ] the typical trajectory for a spp launched on the tubular surface surrounded by the carpet consisting of these two parts .",
    "we report in figure [ fig5 ] the associated finite element computations .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]      in this section we consider an arbitrary shaped rotator described as follows : @xmath76 one can see in figure [ fig7](b ) that the spp is smoothly rotated within the rotator . moreover , the concentrator is itself invisible for spps as the wavefronts are unperturbed outside this metamaterial .",
    "[ fig6 ]    more precisely , we consider the geometric transform : @xmath77 + @xmath78 + @xmath79 +      in this section we consider an arbitrary shaped concentrator described as follows : @xmath80 one can see in figure [ fig7](a ) that the spp is smoothly squeezed within the concentrator .",
    "moreover , the concentrator is itself invisible for spps as the wavefronts are unperturbed outside this metamaterial .",
    "[ fig7 ]    more precisely , we consider the following geometric transform : @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83 :    @xmath84    @xmath85 :    @xmath86",
    "[ fig8 ]    in order to illustrate analytically the control of the evanescent component of the spp , we consider the case of a curved surface which is invariant along the @xmath21-direction , see figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "following the paper by della valle and longhi @xcite where a detailed discussion of the role played by the geometric potential on the spp envelope in the direction of propagation led to the evolution equation : @xmath87 in the case of two isotropic media .",
    "della valle and longhi used a two - scale asymptotic expansion in the electromagnetic field , assuming that the local curvature of the interface is small , i.e. @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a small positive parameter .",
    "importanttly , the asymptotic expansions are assumed as follows : @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 i.e. for p- and s - field components .",
    "moreover , the corrective terms are functions of the slow variable @xmath94 .",
    "the former authors obtain a hierarchy of auxilliary equations at successive powers of @xmath90 . at the leading order @xmath95 , they retrieve the usual effective index of the spp : @xmath96 and proceed with the interface conditions for the field to obtain the asymptotic expansion of the decay length : @xmath97 where the corrective terms @xmath98 undergo some oscillations on the slow spatial scale @xmath99 .",
    "regarding the penetration depth of the spp in the 2 media , della valle and longhi deduce the following expression : @xmath100 from the solvability condition : @xmath101 at order @xmath102 .",
    "we performed a similar analysis for a transformed ( anisotropic heterogeneous ) medium above the curved surface .",
    "the transformed medium is assummed to be described by diagonal tensors of permittivity and permeability @xmath103 where the geometric potential is given by : @xmath104    in the local coordinate basis , we obtain the same evolution equation , with a new effective index @xmath105 where the geometric potential is now given by : @xmath106",
    "we have demonstrated the full control of surface plasmon polariton propagation by extending the transformational optics tools to the area of plasmonics .",
    "we have shown that we can markedly reduce the scattering of spp on a bumped surface thanks to invisibility carpets whose design is the same as for an out - of - plane electromagnetic field incident upon the metal surface .",

    "<S> transformational optics allow for a markedly enhanced control of the electromagnetic wave trajectories within metamaterials with interesting applications ranging from perfect lenses to invisibility cloaks , carpets , concentrators and rotators . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a review of curved anisotropic heterogeneous meta - surfaces designed using the tool of transformational plasmonics , in order to achieve a similar control for surface plasmon polaritons in cylindrical and conical carpets , as well as cylindrical cloaks , concentrators and rotators of a non - convex cross - section . </S>",
