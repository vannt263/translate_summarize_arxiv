    "scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) @xcite is an experimental technique that probes the reaction of confined electron system to perturbation introduced by the charge of atomic force microscope tip that sweeps above the sample area .",
    "the sgm technique has been applied to a number of systems , including quantum point contacts @xcite , currents in the quantum hall regime @xcite , quantum rings @xcite , and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the quantum dots that are studied with sgm include the closed ones @xcite , in which the transport is governed by the coulomb blockade of the current .",
    "the potential of the tip changes the energy of the confined system in an extent that depends on the local charge density .",
    "the energy shift can be experimentally measured which allows for the read - out of the confined charge density distribution @xcite . on the other hand , open quantum dots @xcite",
    "are strongly coupled to the reservoirs , the flow of the current is never strictly blocked , and the tip potential only modifies the conductance . according to the landauer - bttiker theory the coherent conductance is determined by the properties of fermi level wave functions @xcite . in particular , the conductance maps of systems based on quantum point contacts are generally well correlated to the current flow at the fermi level @xcite . for open quantum dots and",
    "quantum rings the sgm signal was attributed @xcite to the electron density at the fermi level called the local density of states ( ldos ) . according to the semi - classical wkb approximation the perturbation  due to the tip for instance ",
    "changes locally the electron wavelength .",
    "the wavelength modulation should have the largest effect in the areas of large ldos and thus the latter should be resolved in conductance maps .",
    "arguments against interpretation of conductance maps as images of the current flow or ldos in the absence of the tip were risen along with formulation of the lippmann - schwinger theory of sgm @xcite . in terms of the perturbation theory @xcite",
    "the corrections to conductance due to the tip are non - local as expressed by the wave function which is a global field .",
    "interference effects introduced by the tip are observed in sgm experiments with quantum point contacts @xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss the interpretation of the @xmath0 mapping for the quantum dot side - attached to a conducting channel .",
    "we develop the results of our previous study @xcite for a cavity strongly coupled to the channel and a single mode transport which indicated that the ldos and @xmath0 maps are clearly correlated only at fano resonances @xcite . here , we study a quantum dot with variable opening ( coupling ) to the channel .",
    "we focus on the limit of a weak point - like perturbation . in this way",
    "we determine the best possible spatial resolution of conductance maps and its possibly maximal correlation with the unperturbed local density of states . in quantum dots that are strongly coupled to the channel ,",
    "the sgm map is usually far from ldos even for the weak point - like perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , we find that for weakly coupled quantum dots the sgm conductance maps are highly correlated to the ldos for any fermi energy .",
    "we explain this finding and indicate the experimental conditions in which sgm measurements precisely probe the local density of states .",

    "let us explain why the ldos is resolved by @xmath0 maps for any @xmath53 when the dot is weakly coupled to the channel .",
    "for this purpose it is convenient to return to the single - subband ( @xmath49 ) result of fig .",

    "[ 4w](a , b ) ] . for @xmath66",

    " not only the probability density is identical for both incidences but also the wave function inside the quantum dot becomes the same @xmath67 ( with precision to a phase ) .",
    "thus the matrix element of the perturbation theory @xmath68 [ see eq .",
    "( 10 ) ] becomes proportional to the probability density and it perfectly matches the ldos which explains the central finding of the present work .    for @xmath69 the conditions for the binary values of @xmath70 can be recognized by the @xmath71 dependence .",
    "we have @xmath1 subbands carrying the current in the main channel of the system [ fig . 1 ] . in the discussed regime the connection to the quantum dot can only transmit the current in a single mode . hence , the electron transfer probability summed over the incident subbands [ eq . ( 2 ) ] should vary then between @xmath72 and @xmath1 .",

    "8(a ) ] and @xmath18 [ fig .",
    "10(b ) ] subbands at the fermi level .",
    "let us comment on the experimental feasibility of the ldos mapping for the weak coupling regime discussed in the present paper .",
    "the open quantum dots connected to electron reservoirs are routinely produced by gating @xcite , etching @xcite , of surface oxidation @xcite techniques .",
    "the open dots @xcite have usually size between 200 nm and 1 @xmath74 m , i.e. of the order of the dimension discussed in the present paper .",
    "the dot needs to be connected to the reservoirs by a narrow channel . for low fermi energy a channel of 80",
    "nm is narrow enough . for higher fermi energies we discussed channels of width as small as 16 nm .",
    "such narrow channels can be defined with the surface oxidation technique that uses the afm tip to deposit the oxide on specific locations of the sample .",
    "formation of quantum wires of width as small as 4 nm by this technique was reported @xcite . for good resolution of the @xmath0 maps",
    "the ratio of the size of the dot to the width of the tip should be the largest .",
    "the correlation of the @xmath0 maps to the ldos depends only on the width of the connection and stays high when the quantum dot size is increased .",
    "figure [ ost ] shows the ldos to @xmath0 map correlation factor for the quantum dot size increased to 600 nm @xmath7 600 nm and @xmath56 nm . for @xmath53 below @xmath75 mev the connection has a single conducting channel and @xmath51 exhibits the binary dependence on the energy as for the case of the smaller dot ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . on the other hand , the ldos mapping can only be realized provided that the quantum dot size is smaller than the coherence length .",
    "the direct measurements @xcite of the phase coherence length in the gaas two - dimensional electron gas . indicate that the phase coherence length depends on the temperature @xmath50 as a @xmath76 function , and at @xmath77 mk the length is of the order of 1 @xmath74 m .",
    "the present results show that the @xmath0 map to ldos correlation factor is a strongly varying function of the energy .",
    "besides the coherence length the temperature affects also the spread of the fermi level . for @xmath77 mk , the spread",
    "@xmath78 is of the order of 10 @xmath74ev .",
    "this value is of the order of the width of resonances [ see fig .",
    "however , outside the resonances for the weak coupling , i.e. in conditions where ldos can be mapped for any @xmath53 , variation of the transfer probability , the correlation factor and finally the ldos with the fermi energy is much slower , so the ldos imaging by @xmath0 measurements should be within the reach of the experiment .",
    "we have studied the conductance response of an open quantum dot to a short range perturbation that scans the surface of the system in the context of mapping the local density of states .",
    "the study covered up to @xmath18 subbands at the fermi level and was supported by the analysis of the density of states localized in the quantum dot on the energy scale .",
    "the latter turns out to determine the contrast of the sgm conductance maps and the sign of the correlation coefficient @xmath51 between the conductance maps and ldos : the sign of @xmath51 is always opposite to the sign of derivative @xmath59 .",
    "we have found that for weak coupling of the quantum dot to the channel , the correlation coefficient of ldos to @xmath0 maps @xmath51 takes binary values , which are close to either -1 or 1 for any @xmath53 . for strongly coupled quantum dots ( large values of @xmath4 )  the dependence of @xmath70 is no longer binary , but @xmath70 tends to @xmath54 at the resonances  for energies corresponding to the dot localized quasi - bound states .",
    "we conclude that for weak coupling of the dot to the channel the tip does not seem to interfere with the scattering wave functions . in the conditions of weak coupling ,",
    "the tip  when localized near the maximum of ldos  tunes the scattering conditions to or away of an extremal value of @xmath50 .",
    "we have explained that these special conditions  when ldos can be extracted from @xmath0 maps for an arbitrary fermi energy ",
    "appear when the connection of the channel to the quantum dot allows only a single transport mode to pass from the channel to the dot .",
    "then , the wave functions inside the quantum dot for both incidence directions are the same up to a phase factor .",
    "this implies that ldos and conductance maps become identical for a delta - like tip potential .",
    "we have indicated that an experimental signature of these conditions is the conductance changing between @xmath2 and @xmath1 in units of @xmath79 as the fermi energy is changed .",
