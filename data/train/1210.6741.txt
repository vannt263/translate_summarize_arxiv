    "in @xcite , a paper that plays a role in these notes , siebenmann mused that his work was initiated at a time when ` respectable ' geometric topology was necessarily compact .",
    "that attitude has long since faded ; today s topological landscape is filled with research in which noncompact spaces are the primary objects .",
    "even so , past traditions have impacted today s topologists , many of whom developed their mathematical tastes when noncompactness was viewed more as a nuisance than an area for exploration . for that and",
    "other reasons , many useful ideas and techniques have been slow to enter the mainstream .",
    "one goal of this set of notes is to provide quick and intuitive access to some of those results and methods by weaving them together with more commonly used approaches , well - known examples , and current research . in this way , we attempt to present a coherent theory of ends  that will be useful to mathematicians with a variety of interests .",
    "numerous topics included here are fundamental to manifold topology and geometric group theory : whitehead and davis manifolds , stallings characterization of euclidean spaces , siebenmann s thesis , chapman and siebenmann s @xmath0-compactification theorem , the freudenthal - hopf - stallings theorem on ends of groups , and applications of the gromov boundary to group theory  to name just a few .",
    "we hope these notes give the reader a better appreciation for some of that work .",
    "many other results and ideas presented here are relatively new or still under development : generalizations of siebenmann s thesis , bestvina s @xmath0-structures on groups , use of @xmath0-boundaries in manifold topology , and applications of boundaries to non - hyperbolic groups , are among those discussed .",
    "there is much room for additional work on these topics ; the natural path of our discussion will bring us near to a number of interesting open problems .",
    "the style of these notes is to provide a lot of motivating examples .",
    "key definitions are presented in a rigorous manner  often preceded by a non - rigorous , but ( hopefully ) intuitive introduction .",
    "proofs or sketches of proofs are included for many of the fundamental results , while many others are left as exercises .",
    "we have not let issues of mathematical rigor prevent the discussion of important or interesting work .",
    "if a theorem or example is relevant , we try to include it , even when the proof is too long or deep for these pages . when possible , an outline or key portions of an argument are provided  with implied encouragement for the reader to dig deeper .",
    "these notes originated in a series of four one - hour lectures given at the workshop on _ geometrical methods in high - dimensional topology _",
    ", _ _ hosted by ohio state university in the spring of 2011 .",
    "notes from those talks were expanded into a one - semester topics course at the university of wisconsin - milwaukee in the fall of that year .",
    "the author expresses his appreciation to workshop organizers jean - francois lafont and ian leary for the opportunity to speak , and acknowledges all fellow participants in the osu workshop and the uwm graduate students in the follow - up course ; their feedback and encouragement were invaluable .",
    "special thanks go to greg friedman and the anonymous referee who read the initial version of this document , pointed out numerous errors , and made many useful suggestions for improving both the mathematics and the presentation .",
    "finally , thanks to my son phillip guilbault who created most of the figures in this document .",
    "a fundamental concept in the study of noncompact spaces is the number of ends . for example , the real line has two ends , the plane has one end , and the uniformly trivalent tree @xmath1 has infinitely many ends .",
    "counting ends has proven remarkably useful , but certainly there is more  after all , there is a qualitative difference between the single end of the ray @xmath2 and that of @xmath3 .",
    "this provides an idea : if , in the topological tradition of counting things , one can ( somehow ) use the @xmath4- or @xmath5-functors to measure the number of ends , then maybe the @xmath6- and @xmath7-functors ( or , for that matter @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , can be used in a similar manner to measure other properties of those ends .",
    "turning that idea into actual mathematics ",
    "the end invariants  of a space  then using those invariants to solve real problems , is one focus of the early portions of these notes .",
    "another approach to confronting noncompact spaces is to compactify .",
    "the 1-point compactification of @xmath10 is a circle and the 1-point compactification of @xmath3 a @xmath11-sphere .",
    "a better  compactification of @xmath10 adds one point to each end , to obtain a closed interval  a space that resembles the line far more than does the circle .",
    "this is a special case of end - point compactification , whereby a single point is added to each end of a space . under that procedure",
    ", an entire cantor set is added to @xmath1 , resulting in a compact , but still tree - like object .",
    "unfortunately , the end - point compactification of @xmath3 again yields a @xmath11-sphere . from the point of view of preserving fundamental properties ,",
    "a far better compactification of @xmath3 adds an entire circle at infinity .",
    "this is a prototypical @xmath0-compactification , with the circle as the @xmath0-boundary .",
    "( the end - point compactifications of @xmath10 and @xmath1 are also @xmath0-compactifications . )",
    "the topic of @xmath0-compactification and @xmath0-boundaries is a central theme in the latter half of these notes .",
    "shape theory is an area of topology developed for studying compact spaces with bad local properties , so it may seem odd that shapes  is one of three topics mentioned in the title of an article devoted to _ noncompact _ spaces with _",
    "nice _ local properties .",
    "this is not a mistake !",
    "as it turns out , the tools of shape theory are easily adaptable to the study of ends  and the connection is not just a similarity in approaches . frequently , the shape of an appropriately chosen compactum precisely captures the illusive topology at the end of a space .",
    "in addition , shape theory plays a clarifying role by connecting end invariants hinted at in paragraph one of this introduction to the @xmath0-boundaries mentioned in paragraph two . to those who know just enough about shape theory to judge it too messy and set - theoretical for use in manifold topology or geometric group theory ( a belief briefly shared by this author ) , patience is encouraged . at the level of generality required for our purposes ,",
    "shape theory is actually quite elegant and geometric . in fact , very little set - theoretic topology is involved ",
    "instead spaces with bad properties are quickly replaced by simplicial and cw complexes , where techniques are clean and intuitive .",
    "a working knowledge of shape theory is one subgoal of these notes .      throughout this article ,",
    "all spaces are separable metric .",
    "compactum _ is a compact space .",
    "_ _ we often restrict attention to _ absolute neighborhood retracts _ ( or _ anrs_)a particularly nice class of spaces , whose most notable property is local contractibility . in these notes ,",
    "anrs are required to be locally compact .",
    "notable examples of anrs are : manifolds , locally finite polyhedra , locally finite cw complexes , proper cat(0 ) spaces , and hilbert cube manifolds . due to their unavoidable importance , a short appendix with precise definitions and fundamental results about anrs has been included .",
    "readers anxious get started can safely begin , by viewing anr  as a common label for the examples just mentioned .",
    "an _ absolute retract _ ( or ar ) is a contractible anr , while an _ enr _ [ resp .",
    ", _ er _ ] is a finite - dimensional anr [ resp . ,",
    "the unmodified term _ manifold _ means finite - dimensional manifold .",
    "a manifold is _ closed _ if it is compact and has no boundary and _ open _ if it is noncompact with no boundary ; if neither is specified , boundary is permitted . for convenience ,",
    "all manifolds are assumed to be piecewise - linear ( pl ) ; in other words , they may be viewed as simplicial complexes in which all links are pl homeomorphic to spheres of appropriate dimensions",
    ". a primary application of pl topology will be the casual use of general position and regular neighborhoods . a good source for that material",
    "is @xcite .",
    "nearly all that we do can be accomplished for smooth or topological manifolds as well ; readers with expertise in those categories will have little trouble making the necessary adjustments .",
    "hilbert cube manifolds are entirely different objects .",

    "hilbert cube manifold _ if each @xmath14 has a neighborhood homeomorphic to @xmath15 .",
    "like anrs , hilbert cube manifolds play an unavoidably key role in portions of these notes .",
    "for that reason , we have included a short and simple appendix on hilbert cube manifolds .",

    "compared to the possibilities presented by a closed universe ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the @xmath39 manifold@xmath40 ) , the idea of a contractible open universe seems rather disappointing , especially to a topologist primed for the ultimate example on which to employ his / her tools .",
