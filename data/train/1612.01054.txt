    "the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere , which is responsible for solar eruptions @xcite , originates from the tachocline at the bottom of the convection zone , and rises up buoyantly out of the solar surface .",
    "because of the antisymmetry of the coriolis force , the magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere often display symmetry or antisymmetry between the northern and the southern hemispheres , i.e. , the @xmath3-effect .",
    "a typical example is the joy s law @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the interaction between the buoyant flux tubes and the turbulent convection zone may weaken any hemispheric preference , i.e. , the @xmath4-effect @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are other effects such as the surface motions and magnetic diffusion . as a result",
    ", the strength of the hemispheric preference is expected to vary for different proxies of the magnetic topology .",
    "for example , in terms of the current helicity , it was found that about @xmath5 of active regions follow the hemispheric rule @xcite , i.e. , the helicity is negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere . in terms of the sunspot whorls , although as high as 80% of the h@xmath3 whorls were found to be counterclockwise ( measured inwardly ) in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "however , it was noticed that only a small fraction of sunspots show a vortical structure @xcite , and most sunspot whorls include both clockwise and counterclockwise h@xmath3 fibrils @xcite .",
    "a similar complex situation happens to the x - ray sigmoids @xcite , since they suffer from projection effects and even potential magnetic fields may also have similar shapes .",
    "another important proxy of the magnetic topology is the chirality of filament channels and their overlying coronal arcade , as proposed by @xcite . here",
    "the chirality of a filament channel is defined to be dextral / sinistral if the axial magnetic field of the filament is to the right / left when viewed from the positive polarity side of the filament channel .",
    "the chirality of filament channels originates from several sources , e.g. , the twist of the magnetic field before emerging into the solar atmosphere , the interaction between two neighboring flux systems , and solar surface motions @xcite .",
    "these sources are further divided into 8 mechanisms , each of which produces the chirality pattern consistent and/or inconsistent with the hemispheric rule @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the percentage of solar filaments which follow the hemispheric rule . with a sample of 73 quiescent filaments , they found that @xmath080% of them were either dextral ( with negative helicity ) in the northern hemisphere or sinistral ( with positive helicity ) in the southern hemisphere . in their paper",
    ", they also proposed a rule , called martin s rule hereafter , i.e. , a dextral filament has right - bearing barbs , whereas a sinistral filament has left - bearing barbs .",
    "with such a one - to - one correspondence , one can immediately determine the chirality of a filament by looking at the h@xmath3 image without the help of vector magnetograms . applying this rule to the h@xmath3 images during 20002001",
    ", @xcite confirmed that @xmath083@xmath6 of the quiescent filament follow the hemispheric rule of helicity .",
    "compared to quiescent filaments , active - region filaments seem to have a weaker hemispheric preference in helicity .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that only @xmath076@xmath7 of active - region filaments follow the hemispheric rule .",
    "as an extreme result , @xcite stated that active - region filaments do not obey the hemispheric rule , with nearly half filaments being dextral or sinistral in each hemisphere .",
    "one might argue that the contradictory results between @xcite and @xcite are due to the small sample , e.g. , only 31 filaments in the former . however , later investigations with bigger samples also led to opposing conclusions .",
    "for example , with 123 filaments , @xcite found that 82% of all filaments follow the hemispheric rule , whereas @xcite identified the chirality of 658 filaments with an automated detection method , and found that only 68% of them obey the hemispheric rule .",
    "such a result of weak preference might be due to the limited resolution of the h@xmath3 full - disk observations so that the automated method can not work well .",
    "what is even worse , @xcite claimed that the hemispheric preference seems to disappear or reverse during parts of the declining phase .",
    "the discrepancy between different researchers might be partly attributed to their chirality identification method , where the filament chirality is determined by the bearing sense of the filament barbs according to martin s rule .",
    "the resulting statistics is contaminated by three factors : ( 1 ) projection effects : a left - bearing barb might be falsely identified to be right - bearing due to the projection effects . this problem becomes more serious as the filament is closer to the solar limb ; ( 2 ) limitation of martin s rule : as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , martin s rule is applicable to the filaments supported by a magnetic flux rope only . for filaments which are supported by a",
    "magnetic sheared arcade , the correspondence between the filament chirality and the bearing sense of the filament barbs would be opposite to the martin s rule ; ( 3 ) multi - sampling : the typical lifetime of a filament is weeks or even months .",
    "therefore , some filaments might be counted several times depending on their lifetime . in order to determine the strength of the hemispheric preference of the filament chirality , a better chirality identification method should be applied .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed to use the  coronal cells \" in the extreme ultra - violet ( euv ) images of the sun along with photospheric magnetograms to determine the chirality of the filament channel .",
    "this method is applicable when the coronal cells are clear .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed an indirect method to determine the chirality of a filament without the help of vector magnetograms , which is independent of the magnetic type of the filament , i.e. , of normal - polarity or inverse - polarity .",
    "this method is based on the observational fact that when a filament erupts , parts of the cold plasmas drain down along the two legs of the supporting magnetic field lines and impact the solar surface , forming two conjugate draining sites @xcite . with respect to the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) or the filament spine ,",
    "the conjugate draining sites are either left - skewed or right - skewed , corresponding to dextral or sinistral chirality , respectively .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is that the draining sites are well separated and are close to the solar surface ( i.e. , not suspended in the corona as the filament barbs ) , which do not suffer from the projection effects .",
    "moreover , only the erupting stage of a filament is considered , by which a filament is sampled only once .",
    "in this paper , we attempt to apply this new method to examine the strength of the hemispheric preference of filament chirality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the data sample and the chirality identification method are described in  [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the results are presented in ",
    "[ sec3 ] , which are discussed in  [ sec4 ] before a summary in  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) mission provides high - resolution euv images and magnetograms , which are observed by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ? * ) and the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi , * ? ? ? * ) , respectively . since its launch in early 2010 ,",
    "the satellite has been monitoring the sun continuously , covering both the rising and the beginning of the declining phases of solar cycle 24 .",
    "solar activities , including filament eruptions , were routinely recorded by the heliophysics event knowledgebase ( hek , * ? ? ? * ) . from 2010 may 13 to 2015 december 31 , there are more than 1000 erupting filaments / prominences",
    ". roughly half of these events are prominences above or behind the limb @xcite . with all these events excluded , 576 filaments are found to erupt on the disk . among these events , only 5 erupting filaments have no clear draining sites .",
    "therefore , a total of 571 erupting filaments are selected as our sample .",
    "the _ sdo_/aia observes the sun in seven euv and three uv channels with a pixel size of @xmath8 and a high time cadence of 12 s. in this study we use the 304  , 171  , and 193   bandpasses in order to trace the filament eruptions and the brightenings associated with the filament drainage .",
    "these filament eruptions are also monitored by the _ global oscillation network group _ ( _ gong _ ) in h@xmath3 @xcite , where filament barbs can be clearly recognized in many of them .",
    "when a filament erupts , generally two draining sites are visible in euv images , and the filament chirality can be identified by the method proposed by @xcite , i.e. , the chirality of a filament is dextral when the draining sites are left - skewed , or sinistral when the draining sites are right - skewed .",
    "the application of this method is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] and explained as follows : the top panels are the sketch maps of the cases with left skew of the draining sites ( panel a , corresponding to dextral chirality ) and right skew of the draining sites ( panel e , corresponding to sinistral chirality ) , respectively , where the dashed lines mark the magnetic pil , the shaded areas represent the filament spine , and the two circles in each panel mark the euv brightenings associated with the filament drainage .",
    "panels ( b  c ) display the evolution of an erupting filament with dextral chirality , whereas panels ( f  g ) display the evolution of an erupting filament with sinistral chirality . to apply this method , we first check the _ sdo_/aia images to obtain the locations of the brightenings associated with the filament draining , as marked by the circles in panels ( c ) and ( g ) of figure [ fig1 ] . in many cases , the skew of the draining sites",
    "can then be determined . in some cases where the filament is curved and the two draining sites are too close to the magnetic pil",
    ", we mark the locations of the draining sites on the _ sdo_/hmi magnetogram , as shown by figure [ fig1](d , h ) . here",
    "the magnetogram is derotated to the time of the euv images . with the correspondence of the draining sites and the magnetic polarities",
    ", we can easily determine the skew of the draining sites , and hence the chirality of the filament .",
    "it is noted that our chirality identification method works well even when only one draining site is visible @xcite .",
    "the validity of this chirality identification method is confirmed with small samples by @xcite and @xcite who found that the results are in accordance with the vector magnetograms , the skew of the twin dimmings and the skew of flaring loops after filament eruption . for a large sample like the one in this paper",
    ", we also checked the chilarity determined by the skew of the associated flaring loops in all the disk events , which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is found that the results obtained by the two methods are exactly the same .",
    "it is also noted that the bright draining sites of erupting filaments would not be confused with flaring patches since the brightening is preceded by the dark draining filament materials , as indicated by figures 3 and 7 in @xcite .",
    "for all the events in our sample , we trace the draining filament materials to determine the bright draining sites .",
    "with the method described in  [ sec2 ] , the chirality of 571 erupting filaments is then determined .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] plots the chirality distribution of these filaments , where the horizontal axis is the time and the vertical axis is the latitude . in this panel ,",
    "the blue diamonds correspond to the filaments with dextral chirality ( hence negative helicity ) , and the red diamonds represent the filaments with sinistral chirality ( hence positive helicity ) .",
    "it is found that 307 out of 324 , i.e. , 94.8% , filaments in the northern hemisphere have negative helicity , and 216 out of 247 , i.e. , 87.4% , filaments in the southern hemisphere have positive helicity . put together ,",
    "91.6% of our sample of erupting filaments follow the hemispheric rule of helicity sign .    in comparison , we apply martin s rule to the same sample , i.e. , to examine the sign of helicity based on the bearing sense of the filament barbs , which are observed by _ gong",
    "_ h@xmath3 telescopes . among the 571 filaments ,",
    "7 events are not visible in h@xmath3 . following @xcite and @xcite , for the remaining 564 filaments",
    ", the sign of helicity is assigned to be negative / positive when the filament barbs are predominantly right - bearing / left - bearing .",
    "the resulting distribution of the helicity sign is displayed in the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] with the same coordinates as the top panel .",
    "similar to the top panel , the blue diamonds correspond to the filaments with dextral chirality ( hence negative helicity ) , and the red diamonds represent the filaments with sinistral chirality ( hence positive helicity ) . among all the 564 h@xmath3 filaments , it is found that 211 out of 322 , i.e. , 65.5% , of the filaments in the northern hemisphere have negative helicity , and 152 out of 242 , i.e. , 62.8% , filaments in the southern hemisphere have positive helicity .",
    "it should be noted that 76 filaments in the northern hemisphere and 66 filaments in the southern hemisphere have no discernable barbs .",
    "if we exclude all the h@xmath3 filaments without identifiable barbs , it is found that 85.8% of the filaments in the northern hemisphere have negative helicity , and 86.4% of the filaments in the southern hemisphere have positive helicity . as a whole ,",
    "86.0% of all the filaments with clear barbs follow the hemispheric rule of helicity sign , which is 5.6% less than the value obtained by our method using the filament draining sites .",
    "following @xcite , we divide the filaments in our sample into three types , i.e. , ( 1 ) quiescent ones , which are located in quiet regions with relatively weaker magnetic field , ( 2 ) intermediate ones with one end in an active region and the other in the quiet region , and ( 3 ) active - region ones , which are located inside an active region .",
    "it is found that among the 571 filaments , there are 379 quiescent filaments , 100 intermediate filaments , and 92 active - region filaments .",
    "their time - latitude diagrams of the helicity sign are displayed in three rows of figure [ fig3 ] , respectively , where the blue diamonds correspond to negative helicity , whereas the red diamonds to positive helicity .",
    "it is shown that the strength of the hemispheric rule is 93% for the quiescent filaments , 95% for the intermediate filaments , and 83% for the active - region filaments , respectively .",
    "on the right side of each row , we sum up the corresponding type of filaments with time and plot their latitude distribution in histograms .",
    "it is revealed that each type of the filaments have a bimodal distribution in latitude . whereas the quiescent filaments are distributed more broadly in latitude , the other two types are more concentrated in low latitudes .",
    "it is also seen that the quiescent and the intermediate filaments that are against the hemispheric rule are concentrated near the equator , whereas the active - region filaments that are against the hemispheric rule are concentrated near the latitude of @xmath020@xmath9 in each hemisphere .",
    "it has been argued that the solar dynamo processes generate well - organized symmetric or antisymmetric magnetic patterns over the two hemispheres of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "important parameters characterizing the magnetic topology are the helicity and handedness or chirality , which can be quantified from vector magnetograms and imaging observations . as a result",
    ", a hemispheric rule was revealed , i.e. , the helicity tends to be negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere .",
    "however , the strength of the hemispheric rule changes with different proxies and even with different samples . as summarized by @xcite ,",
    "the strength lies in the range @xmath062%82% for sunspot whorls @xcite , @xmath060%82% for vector magnetograms of active regions @xcite , @xmath064%87% for x - ray sigmoids @xcite , @xmath055%76% for active - region filaments @xcite , and @xmath082%84% for quiescent and intermediate filaments @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , for all these proxies , the sign of helicity or chirality may be mis - identified for different reasons , e.g. , projection effects , faraday rotation , and so on @xcite . in terms of the filament chirality , the traditional identification method is based on martin s rule , i.e. , right - bearing barbs correspond to dextral chirality , and left - bearing barbs correspond to sinistral chirality @xcite . however , as pointed out by @xcite , the martin s rule is valid only for the inverse - polarity filaments , i.e. , those magnetically supported by a flux rope . for normal - polarity filaments ,",
    "i.e. , those supported by a sheared arcade , however , the one - to - one correspondence is opposite , i.e. , right - bearing barbs correspond to sinistral chirality , whereas left - bearing barbs correspond to dextral chirality .",
    "therefore , when the martin s rule is applied to a normal - polarity filament , its chirality would be mis - identified . in order to estimate the strength of the hemispheric rule of filament chirality , in this paper we applied a new method proposed by @xcite , which is based on the skew of the filament draining sites .",
    "it is found that 523 out of 571 , i.e. , 91.6% , erupting filaments during 20102015 follow the hemispheric rule .",
    "we further divided these filaments into quiescent , intermediate , and active - region types , and found that the strength of the hemispheric rule is 93% for the quiescent filaments , 95% for the intermediate filaments , and 83% for the active - region filaments , respectively .",
    "compared to the previous studies @xcite , our estimates of the strength for the quiescent and the intermediate filaments are slightly higher , but our estimate of the strength for the active - region filaments is remarkably higher .    in order to more quantitatively",
    "compare our result with those obtained using martin s rule , we also applied the martin s rule to all our filament events .",
    "the bearing sense of the filament barbs is judged by the h@xmath3 images observed by the _ gong _ network .",
    "it is found that there are no h@xmath3 observations for 7 events . for the remaining 564 filaments , 363 ,",
    "i.e. , 64.3% , filaments follow the hemispheric rule .",
    "it should be noted that among the 564 filaments , 142 , i.e. , 25.2% , of them have no clear barbs , hence their chirality can not be determined by the martin s rule .",
    "if we exclude these filaments , then 86.0% of all the filaments with clear barbs follow the hemispheric rule .",
    "such a value is about 5.6% smaller than our estimate using filament draining sites .",
    "compared to some of the previous studies , our statistics shows a significantly stronger hemispheric preference of filament chirality , i.e. , dextral in the northern hemisphere and sinistral in the southern hemisphere .",
    "for the quiescent filaments , @xcite analyzed 73 filaments and found that the strength of the hemispheric rule is 82% .",
    "later , @xcite analyzed 1436 filaments , which leads to similar strength , i.e. , 83% .",
    "however , our estimate is as high as 93% . for the intermediate filaments",
    ", @xcite found that the strength of the hemispheric rule is 84% .",
    "however , our estimate is up to 95% . for the active - region filaments , whereas @xcite estimated the strength of the hemispheric rule to be 76% , @xcite claimed that there is no hemispheric preference .",
    "however , we found that 83% of the active - region filaments follow the hemispheric rule .",
    "the reason for the remarkable difference is probably that the previous authors used the bearing sense of filament barbs to determine the chirality of the filaments , which would lead to misidentification of chirality when the filament is of the normal - polarity type , i.e. , the corresponding magnetic configuration is a sheared arcade .",
    "that is to say , we can not judge the chirality of a filament by the bearing sense of its barbs @xcite , nor can we judge the chirality by the magnetic polarities of the two endpoints of a filament @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the chirality can be visually determined by other patterns , such as the skew of the filament draining sites @xcite , the skew of coronal loops or flaring loops @xcite , and the skew of the twin dimmings upon filament eruptions @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the hemispheric rule might be time - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the results were divergent . in terms of the current helicity ,",
    "the violation of the hemispheric rule was claimed to happen in any phase of a solar cycle .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite claimed that the hemispheric rule might be opposite near solar minimum .",
    "however , @xcite found that the hemispheric rule is opposite during the rising phase of solar cycle 23 . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite suggested that the violation of the hemispheric rule happens in the declining phase of solar cycle 23 .    in terms of the filament chirality",
    ", @xcite theoretically predicted that the hemispheric rule may disappear during the declining phase of a solar cycle .",
    "@xcite applied an automated method to a big sample of filaments from 2001 to 2012 .",
    "as a preliminary result , they showed that the hemispheric rule waxes and wanes .",
    "it is strongly present in 20012002 around solar maximum , but reverses in 20062007 , which was approaching solar minimum . at other times , it is wholly absent .",
    "again , they determined the filament chirality by the martin s rule , which is valid only for the filaments that are magnetically supported by a flux rope according to @xcite .    in this paper , we used the filament draining sites to determine the filament chirality . a quick look at our results in figure [ fig3 ] immediately gives an impression that the hemispheric rule of the filament chirality roughly holds well from 2010 to 2015 . in order to check the cyclic evolution of the strength of the hemispheric rule , we calculate @xmath10 , the percentage of the filaments which follow the hemispheric rule each year , and plot its evolution in figure [ fig4 ] , where the top panel compares the strength of the hemispheric rule of all the filaments ( _ connected red squares _ ) with the smoothed sunspot number @xcite , and the bottom panel compares the strength of the hemispheric rule among quiescent filaments ( _ red squares _ ) , intermediate filaments ( _ green squares _ ) , and active - region filaments ( _ blue squares _ ) .",
    "it can be seen that as a whole , the filament chirality follows the hemispheric rule very well , and the strength is @xmath090% in the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , though slightly decreases to @xmath087% during the solar maximum and the declining phase . after dividing these filaments into three types , it is then found that the strength of the quiescent filaments decreases slightly from @xmath097% in the rising phase to @xmath085% in the declining phase , whereas the strength of the intermediate filaments keeps a high value around @xmath1 from 2010 to 2015 .",
    "only the active - region filaments show significant variations . their strength of the hemispheric rule rises from @xmath063% to @xmath095% in the rising phase , and keeps a high value @xmath2 during the declining phase .",
    "however , during a period from 2013 june to 2014 january , which is around the solar maximum , the hemispheric preference totally vanishes . as seen from figure [ fig3 ] , whereas no active - region filaments erupt in the northern hemisphere during this period ( marked by the two vertical dashed lines in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) , there are equal active - region filaments with dextral and sinistral chirality in the southern hemisphere . during this period",
    ", the sunspot area in the southern hemisphere reaches its highest peak in solar cycle 24 , whereas the sunspot area in the northern hemisphere reaches a local minimum @xcite .",
    "similar to our result , @xcite also found that the fraction of active regions with reversed helicity sign is higher near the solar maximum of solar cycle 22 .",
    "we are still not sure whether the absence of the hemispheric rule of the active - region filaments ( and hence the corresponding active regions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) near solar maximum happens every solar cycle . however , it is interesting to notice that active regions that do not follow the hemispheric rule are generally more productive in solar flares @xcite .",
    "magnetic measurements indicate that solar filaments can be divided into ( 1 ) inverse - polarity filaments , whose magnetic field component perpendicular to the magnetic pil is opposite to what expected from the photospheric magnetograms , and ( 2 ) normal - polarity filaments , whose magnetic orientation is the same as expected from the photospheric magnetograms @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the two types of filaments are described by the kr model @xcite and the ks model @xcite , respectively .",
    "the former corresponds to a flux rope , whereas the latter corresponds to a sheared arcade .",
    "the original 2-dimensional models were later extended to 3-dimensions @xcite . with solar filaments being the progenitor of coronal mass ejections ( cmes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is natural to think that the pre - eruption magnetic structure is a flux rope in some cme events , and a sheared arcade in other events @xcite , which was confirmed by @xcite in observations .",
    "however , we are still lacking the information on the percentage of the two types of solar filaments .    in 1980s",
    ", efforts were made to measure the magnetic field of solar prominences @xcite . according to @xcite , @xmath025% of their @xmath11900 measurements in a sample of 120 prominences",
    "correspond to the normal - polarity configuration .",
    "however , as they discussed in their paper , such a ratio is biased by several selection effects .",
    "besides , there are different numbers of measurements for different prominences . with their result ,",
    "we still do not know how many prominences have the normal - polarity configuration .",
    "unfortunately , there were no systematic measurements of magnetic field for filaments / prominences in order to distinguish between inverse - polarity and normal - polarity configurations .",
    "however , recently @xcite proposed an indirect method to distinguish the two types of magnetic configurations , i.e. , a dextral / sinistral filament with right-/left - bearing barbs respectively has an inverse - polarity configuration , whereas a dextral / sinistral filament with left-/right - bearing barbs respectively has a normal - polarity configuration .",
    "this method can be summarized as follows : the filaments which obey martin s rule have the inverse - polarity configuration , whereas the filaments which disobey martin s rule have the normal - polarity configuration . in order to check the percentage of each type of filaments",
    ", we apply this method to our sample of 571 erupting filaments .",
    "considering that 142 filaments have no clear barbs , we scrutinize the high - resolution _ sdo_/aia images to examine the bearing sense of the filament threads rather than the filament barbs , since filament threads are more reliable than filament barbs in determining the bearing direction @xcite . with the filament threads not identifiable in 7 filaments ,",
    "we finally get a sample of 564 filaments , including 372 quiescent filaments , 100 intermediate filaments , and 92 active - region filaments .",
    "it is found that martin s rule and our new chirality identification method agree with each other for 503 out of 564 , i.e. , 89% , filaments , i.e. , these filaments are magnetically supported by a flux rope , therefore are inverse - polarity filaments ; however , martin s rule and our new method do not agree with each other for 61 out of 564 , i.e. , 11% , filaments , i.e. , they are magnetically supported by a sheared arcade , therefore are normal - polarity filaments . among the 61 normal - polarity filaments ,",
    "there are 15 quiescent filaments , 9 intermediate filaments , and 37 active - region filaments . in another word , among our sample , 37 out of 92 , i.e. , 40% , active - region filaments are of the normal - polarity type , 9 out of 100 , i.e. , 9% , intermediate filaments are of the normal - polarity type , and 15 out of 372 , i.e. , 4% , quiescent filaments are of the normal - polarity type .",
    "these results are illustrated by the diagrams in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "it is noted here that in h@xmath3 images , many filaments may have co - existing left - bearing and right - bearing barbs .",
    "some are real , as discussed by @xcite , others might be due to projection effects . in this section",
    ", we used filament threads to check the bearing sense , instead .",
    "it is found that only 6 filaments have co - existing left - bearing and right - bearing barbs .",
    "we take the dominant sense for each filament .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the minority threads in each filament are generally located near one end of the spine , and remain intact upon eruption .",
    "in this paper , we performed statistical analyses on the chirality and the magnetic configurations ( inverse - polarity versus normal polarity ) of the solar filaments which erupt on disk from 2010 may 13 to 2015 december 31 , covering both the rising phase and the beginning of the declining phases of solar cycle 24 .",
    "the chirality is determined by an indirect method proposed by @xcite , i.e. , left-/right - skewed drainage corresponds to the dextral / sinistral chirality , respectively .",
    "the determination of the magnetic configuration is also based on a method proposed by @xcite , i.e. , those filaments that follow the martin s rule @xcite are of the inverse - polarity type , and those that disobey martin s rule are of the normal - polarity type . by studying a sample of 571 filaments",
    ", we obtained the following results :    \\(1 ) about 94.8% of the filaments in the northern hemisphere have negative helicity , and 87.4% of the filaments in the southern hemisphere have positive helicity , indicating a significant hemispheric preference of helicity . as a whole ,",
    "91.6% of our sample of erupting filaments follow the hemispheric rule of helicity sign . with the improved method in determining the filament chirality , the strength of the hemispheric rule is higher than previous studies . it should be noted that the statistical result is based on the erupting filaments .",
    "those filaments which do not erupt during the disk passage are not included in our sample .",
