    "the transmission amplitude @xmath23 is generally complex .",
    "here we formulate the scattering matrix of edge states in the setup of fig .  4a , and derive the conductance @xmath163 .",
    "the edge fermions at four ends of the sample are denoted by @xmath253 and @xmath254 as shown in fig .",
    "4a . with transmission coefficient @xmath23 and reflection coefficient @xmath147 at the point contact",
    ", the scattering matrix @xmath255 due to the point contact is @xmath256 upon basis transformation from majorana fermions to charged fermions on qah edges , we have @xmath257 based on which the normal / andreev transmission / reflection probabilities are given as @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 .",
    "according to the generalized landauer - bttiker formula , the conductance defined in the main text is @xmath261 note that the conductance @xmath163 merely depends on the real part of majorana transmission coefficient @xmath23 , physically it is due to the fact that charged fermions are treated as combinations of majorana fermions with transmissions @xmath23 and perfect transmission @xmath262 .",
    "in this section we analyze the temperature dependence of majorana transmission coefficient @xmath23 by renormalization group technique in detail  @xcite . specifically , we focus on its real part @xmath263 , since it is directly related to the conductance @xmath92 .",
    "our starting point is the action for the model in eq .",
    "( [ tunnel_model ] ) of the paper , @xmath264.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the majorana tunneling occurs locally at @xmath265 , the scaling dimension of the tunneling strength @xmath164 vanishes , i.e. @xmath266=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 is invariant when the temperature @xmath170 of the system changes , and so does the transmission coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath23 comes from higher irrelevant terms at the point contact .",
    "the leading irrelevant term is a four fermion interaction of the following form : @xmath267 it represents the tunneling of one pair of majorana fermions from one edge to the other .",
    "the scaling dimension of @xmath174 is @xmath268=-3 $ ] , hence it is irrelevant and scales as @xmath269 when @xmath270 .",
    "increasing the temperature @xmath170 will enhance the effective interaction strength @xmath174 , which affects the transmission coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath271 to the transmission coefficient @xmath23 can be calculated perturbatively as follows .",
    "suppose both @xmath164 and @xmath174 are small , so that perturbation theory can be used .",
    "we shall regard @xmath272 and @xmath271 given above as the perturbation .",
    "consider an in - state @xmath273 of majorana fermion @xmath234 , and a transmitted out - state @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the system ground state .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath23 is then given by @xmath276 where @xmath277 stands for the time ordering .",
    "the zero - order @xmath278 is simply @xmath279 .",
    "the first - order contribution @xmath280 is @xmath281 since @xmath282 is odd in @xmath234 and @xmath235 , its first - order contribution vanishes .",
    "the second term of @xmath271 is purely imaginary and therefore does not contribute to the conductance @xmath163 .",
    "the second - order correction @xmath283 the @xmath284 term gives a constant contribution @xmath285 , in agreement with calculations in appendix b. the cross term @xmath286 vanishes because it is odd in @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "the @xmath287 term results in a temperature dependent correction to the real part of transmission coefficient @xmath23 as @xmath288 therefore , the transmission coefficient @xmath23 generically decreases as temperature @xmath170 increases .",
    "when the temperature @xmath170 is above a characteristic temperature @xmath289 , the interaction @xmath174 at the point contact dominates , so that @xmath23 becomes small and @xmath147 becomes large . in this case , the above perturbative treatment is no longer valid .",
    "however , this case can be effectively viewed as a breaking up of original majorana edge states @xmath234 and @xmath235 and a remerge of them into two new majorana edge states @xmath290 and @xmath291 on the left and right of the point contact , and of the two tscs merging into a single tsc . in the temperature range @xmath292",
    ", we can do a perturbation calculation about the high temperature fixed point before the superconducting phase is destroyed .",
    "this scenario is very similar with our setup in fig .  1a , except that the two edges are brought together at the point contact .",
    "since the region between the edges in this case is a sc , there are both fermion tunnelings and vortex tunnelings between edges  @xcite .",
    "the effective action for this point contact is @xmath293,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath294 and @xmath295 are the vortex operators on edges with a scaling dimension @xmath296=[\\sigma_2]=1/16 $ ] .",
    "dimension counting renders @xmath297=0 $ ] and @xmath298=7/8 $ ] , so the vortex - vortex tunneling is the most relevant .",
    "therefore , at a high temperature @xmath170 , the vortex - vortex tunneling term gives the temperature dependence of transmission coefficient @xmath23 @xmath299 the power - law relation is valid above a characteristic temperature @xmath300 , provided the sc gap @xmath301 is much higher .",
    "in fact , this confirms the robustness of the half - quantized plateau . for in the setup with reasonable finite temperature ,",
    "the edges are far away from each other , so the tunneling strengths including @xmath180 are sufficiently tiny , resulting in an extremely low @xmath302 .",
