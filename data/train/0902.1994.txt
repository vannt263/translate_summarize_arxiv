    "this metric does not change its form under the coordinate transformation : @xmath4 and is galilean for @xmath5 .",
    "therefore it is also galilean for @xmath6 , describing an einstein - rosen bridge ( wormhole ) : two schwarzschild solutions to the einstein field equations ( a black hole and white hole ) connected at the singular ( @xmath7 ) surface @xmath8 ( common event horizon ) @xcite .",

    "the spacetime given by the metric ( [ interv1 ] ) for @xmath13 is regarded by an observer at @xmath11 as the interior of a black hole .",
    "because of the invariance of the metric ( [ interv1 ] ) under the transformation ( [ transf ] ) , this interior is an image of the other exterior sheet .",
    "this situation is analogous to the method of image charges for spheres in electrostatics , where the interaction between an electric charge situated at a distance @xmath14 from the center of a conducting sphere of radius @xmath15 is equivalent to the interaction of the same charge with a charge of the opposite sign situated inside this sphere at a distance @xmath16 from its center @xcite .",

    "iii , the proper time @xmath21 of the particle coincides with @xmath118 , so @xmath118 has the meaning of the physical coordinate time of a white hole ( region iii ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath85 in the radial geodesic motion of a massive particle into an einstein - rosen black hole is given by @xmath119 the segment @xmath120 corresponds to the motion from @xmath19 ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) to @xmath8 ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) , and the segment @xmath125 corresponds to the motion from @xmath8 ( @xmath126 , @xmath124 ; the slope @xmath91 is continuous at the horizon as we go from point @xmath105 to @xmath112 ) to @xmath127 ( @xmath128 , @xmath122 ) . therefore crossing the einstein - rosen bridge is possible if we regard rindler s elliptic identification of the two antipodal future event horizons as physical .",
    "the particle enters region iii ( with no possibility of coming back to region i ) , which has no curvature singularities and is mathematically equivalent to the asymptotically flat exterior of a white hole @xcite .",
    "the particle s proper time does not end in this region , but extends to infinity .",
    "the difference in the character of the radial motion inside the event horizon between an einstein - rosen black hole and a schwarzschild black hole indicates that the two black hole solutions are physically different with regard to the nature of the interior sheet and equivalent with regard to the nature of the static exterior sheet ( region i ) . for an einstein - rosen black hole with rindler s elliptic identification of the two antipodal future event horizons the interior ( from the point of view of a distant observer ; it really is the exterior region iii ) is static , while for a schwarzschild black hole the interior ( region ii ) is nonstatic .",
    "rindler s identification also guarantees that the einstein - rosen bridge is a stable solution to the gravitational field equations ; without this identification the bridge would be unstable @xcite .",
    "another difference between a schwarzschild black hole and an einstein - rosen black hole comes from the integral of the time - time component of the gravitational energy - momentum pseudotensor ( either einstein or landau - lifshitz ) over the interior hypersurface , i.e. the total energy of the system @xcite .",
    "this energy equals the sensible physical value @xmath129 for an einstein - rosen black hole , but diverges for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "although the construction of the einstein - rosen bridge in the kruskal coordinates through rindler s elliptic identification of the two antipodal future event horizons may seem artificial , the necessity for rindler s identification to avoid the particle s motion to the central singularity may be related to a singular behavior of the kruskal metric in the minkowski limit @xmath130 . however , the kruskal coordinates are advantageous in describing the einstein - rosen bridge because the surface @xmath8 is regular ( @xmath131 ) in these coordinates .",
    "the schwarzschild black hole solution , singular at the center , does not exist in isotropic coordinates , while the einstein - rosen bridge ( wormhole ) geometry , regular everywhere , can be built in the schwarzschild coordinates by gluing together two schwarzschild exterior sheets at their common event horizon @xcite . while the schwarzschild metric is the spherically symmetric solution to the einstein field equations in vacuum",
    "if we solve these equations using the schwarzschild coordinates , the einstein - rosen bridge is the spherically symmetric solution to the einstein field equations if we solve these equations using isotropic coordinates for a source which is vacuum everywhere except at the surface @xmath8 .",
    "it has been shown that the einstein - rosen bridge metric ( [ interv1 ] ) is not a solution of the vacuum einstein equations but it requires the presence of a nonzero energy - momentum tensor source @xmath132 that is divergent and violates the energy conditions at the throat of the wormhole @xcite .",
    "this metric satisfies the levi - civita identity , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the laplace - beltrami operator @xcite .",
    "this identity gives for ( [ interv1 ] ) : @xmath135 the curvature scalar at the throat of such a wormhole acquires a similar delta - function contribution .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the delta - function matter source in the einstein - rosen bridge at @xmath8 is a lightlike brane self - consistently interacting with gravity .",
    "both black hole solutions are mathematically legitimate , and only experiment or observation can reveal the nature of the infalling radial motion of a particle into a physical black hole . since the two solutions are indistinguishable for distant observers , which can see only the exterior sheet , the nature of the interior of a physical black hole can not be satisfactorily determined , unless an observer enters or resides in the interior region . this condition would be satisfied if our universe were the interior of a black hole existing in a bigger universe @xcite . because einstein s general theory of relativity does not choose a time orientation , if a black hole can form from the gravitational collapse of matter through an event horizon in the future then the reverse process also possible",
    "such a process would describe an exploding white hole : matter emerging from an event horizon in the past , like the expanding universe .",
    "scenarios in which the universe was born from the interior of an einstein - rosen black hole may avoid many of the problems of the standard big - bang cosmology and the black hole information - loss problem @xcite . these scenarios , involving gravitational collapse of a sphere of dust in isotropic coordinates , and generalization of the results of the present letter to schwarzschild - de sitter and kerr black holes will be the subjects of further study .",
