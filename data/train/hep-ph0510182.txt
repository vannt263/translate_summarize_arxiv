    "during the last several years the physics of neutrinos has achieved a remarkable progress . the experiments with solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and recently also long - baseline accelerator  @xcite neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the most significant recent contributions are given by the new super - kamiokande data on the @xmath0 dependence of multi - gev @xmath4-like atmospheric neutrino events  @xcite , @xmath1 being the distance traveled by neutrinos and @xmath2 the neutrino energy , and by the new more precise spectrum data of the kamland  @xcite and k2k experiments  @xcite .",
    "for the first time these data show the oscillatory dependence on @xmath0 of the probabilities of neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the existence of neutrino oscillations plays a crucial role in our understanding of neutrino physics as it implies non - zero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "the present data requires two large ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and one small ( @xmath3 ) angles in the pontecorvo  maki ",
    " sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite , and at least two mass square differences , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the neutrino masses , one driving the atmospheric neutrino oscillations ( @xmath9 ) and one the solar ones ( @xmath10 ) . the mixing angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 control the solar and the dominant atmospheric neutrino oscillations , while @xmath3 is the angle limited by the data from the chooz and palo verde experiments  @xcite .",
    "the super - kamiokande  @xcite and k2k  @xcite data are well described in terms of dominant @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) vacuum oscillations .",
    "the former require the following best fit values of the mass squared difference and mixing angle : @xmath13  @xcite , whereas the latter are best explained for @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the 90% c.l . allowed ranges of these parameters obtained by the super - kamiokande experiment read  @xcite : [ eq : range ] || = ( 1.5 - 3.4)10 ^ -3ev^2 ,   ^22_230.92 .",

    "interval reads @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 , @xmath18 , can not be determined with the existing data .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , correspond to two different types of neutrino mass ordering : normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath19 ) , and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , @xmath22 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in addition , information on the octant where @xmath6 lies , if @xmath23 , is beyond the reach of present experiments .",
    "the 2-neutrino oscillation analysis of the solar neutrino data , including the results from the complete salt phase of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiment  @xcite , in combination with the recent kamland 766.3 ton - year spectrum data  @xcite , shows that the solar neutrino oscillation parameters lie in the low - lma ( large mixing angle ) region , with best fit values  @xcite = 8.0 10 ^ -5  ev^2 ,   ^2 _ 12 = 0.31 .",

    ". a more accurate measurement of the leading neutrino oscillation parameters will be achieved by the minos  @xcite , opera  @xcite and icarus  @xcite experiments and future atmospheric and solar neutrino detectors  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the @xmath3 angle is crucial as it opens up the possibility of the experimental measurement of the cp ( or t ) violating phase @xmath24 , and to establishing the type of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a wide experimental program is under discussion in order to achieve these goals .    the mixing angle @xmath3 controls the @xmath25 and @xmath26 conversions in long - baseline experiments and the @xmath27 disappearance in short - baseline reactor experiments .",
    "present and future conventional beams  @xcite , super - beams with an upgraded proton source and a more intense neutrino flux  @xcite , and future reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite have the possibility to measure , or set a stronger limit on , @xmath3 .",
    "smaller values of this mixing angle could be accessed by very long baseline experiments such as neutrino factories  @xcite , or by @xmath28-beams  @xcite which exploit neutrinos from boosted - ion decays , or by super - beams with megaton detectors  @xcite , or by electron - capture facilities  @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath3 also controls the earth matter effects in multi - gev atmospheric  @xcite and in supernova  @xcite neutrino oscillations .",
    "the magnitude of the t - violating and cp  violating terms as well as matter effects in long baseline neutrino oscillations is controlled by @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "if the value of @xmath3 is sizable and at the reach of future experiments , it would be possible to search for cp  violation in the lepton sector and to determine the type of neutrino mass hierarchy by establishing @xmath18  decay experiments could establish the type of neutrino mass spectrum  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) and , possibly , might provide some information on the presence of cp  violation in the lepton sector due to majorana cp  violating phases  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . ] .",
    "typically , the proposed experiments have a single detector and plan to run with the beam in two different modes , neutrinos and antineutrinos . in principle , by comparing the probability of neutrino and antineutrino flavor conversion , the values of the cp  violating phase @xmath24 and of @xmath18 can be extracted .",
    "different sets of values of cp  conserving and violating parameters , @xmath30 , lead to the same probabilities of neutrino and antineutrino conversion and provide a good description of the data at the same confidence level .",
    "this problem is known as the problem of degeneracies in the neutrino parameter space  @xcite and severely affects the sensitivities to these parameters in future long - baseline experiments .",
    "many strategies have been advocated to resolve this issue . some of the degeneracies might be eliminated with sufficient energy or baseline spectral information  @xcite . however , statistical errors and realistic efficiencies and backgrounds limit considerably the capabilities of this method .",
    "another detector  @xcite or the combination with another experiment  @xcite would , thus , be necessary  @xcite . ] .",
    "the use of only a neutrino beam could help in resolving the type of hierarchy when two different long - baselines are considered  @xcite .",
    "the most favorable case is keeping the same @xmath0 at the two different baselines . in particular",
    ", it was shown that just one experiment , named super-  @xcite , which runs in the neutrino mode and uses two detectors at different distances and different off - axis angles , could determine the type of hierarchy for values of @xmath31 as small as 0.02 .",
    "this method is free of degeneracies .",
    "it uses the fact that , comparing the probability of conversion at the two sites , the vacuum oscillation term cancels out , leaving as dominant the term sensitive to matter effects .",
    "hence the leading cp  violating term cancels and cp  violation gives only a subdominant correction .",
    "off - axis neutrino beams have a very narrow neutrino spectra , and their peak energy can be tuned by displacing the detector out of the main beam axis .",
    "we notice that an off - axis beam can be obtained by either putting the detector a few km away from the location of an on - axis surface detector , or by placing it on the vertical of the beam - line but at a much shorter distance .",
    "in such a way , a single beam could do the job of two beams with different energies . in ref .",
    "@xcite the case of the numi beam and two 50  kton liquid argon tpc detectors , one at the proposed site  @xcite and the second at a shorter baseline , 200 and 434  km , was studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the hierarchy can be determined at 95  %  c.l .",
    ", regardless of the value of @xmath24 , for @xmath32 for a conventional beam and for @xmath33 with a proton driver .",
    "this should be compared with the sensitivity of the proposed experiment  @xcite . at 95  %  c.l .",
    ", only for less than 40  % of the values of @xmath24 , the type of neutrino mass hierarchy can be resolved if @xmath34 in a 3 neutrino plus 3 antineutrino running  @xcite .    here , we follow the super- strategy  @xcite but we consider a more realistic scenario .",
    "we consider the use of the proposed detector , a 30  kton low - z calorimeter , at the far site .",
    "we add a second off - axis detector , either a liquid argon or a water - erenkov detector , at a shorter baseline of 200  km , keeping @xmath0 constant at the two sites .",
    "in addition , we provide a sequencing for the construction of the experiment , assuming that the second detector will be constructed at a second stage .",
    "if the mixing angle @xmath3 is very small , then adding the second detector would increase the statistics for constraining this parameter but would not provide any useful information on the type of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath3 is within the sensitivity of the experiment and a positive signal is found in the first years of running , the construction of the second off - axis detector would enormously enhance the capabilities for the determination of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy , ( almost ) free of degeneracies .",
    "let us stress that the unique contribution of the numi neutrino program and of the experiment would be establishing the type of hierarchy  .",
    "therefore we focus on this issue and we study in detail the requirements for the second detector for achieving this remarkable result . in addition , we also study the possibility of the measurement of cp  violation within this experimental setup . in order for this to be possible ,",
    "the running with antineutrinos is completely necessary .",
    "hence , in our sequencing of the experimental setup , we also add some years of antineutrino data .",
    "we start by reviewing the relevant formalism and the power of the method in sec .",

[ diffloc ] , we compare different possible choices for the location of the second off - axis detector and argue why the choice we make here is preferable . finally , in section .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we summarize and conclude .",
    "in the present study we focus on the capabilities of reducing degeneracies of a long - baseline neutrino experiment with two off - axis detectors . it is well known that an off - axis neutrino beam is characterized by a well peaked spectrum , so for sake of analytical understanding we can take it as approximately monochromatic .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that a particularly suitable configuration for the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy is such that the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the baseline and @xmath2 is the neutrino energy , is the same for both detectors . for this particular configuration ,",
    "the use of just a neutrino running could be sufficient to determine the type of neutrino mass spectrum , depending upon the actual value of @xmath36 .",
    "we review below the analytical expressions illustrating this result .    for neutrino energies",
    "@xmath37 1 gev , @xmath3 within the present bounds  @xcite , and baselines @xmath38  km  @xcite   gev we have checked that the analytical expansion is accurate for @xmath39 km within the present bounds of @xmath3 and @xmath40  @xcite . ]",

    "we define @xmath48 as the average electron number density , with @xmath49 the electron number density along the baseline .",
    "in addition , taking into account that for the baselines and energies of interest the matter effects are small ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) a further expansion can be carried out .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for this experimental configuration of the detectors , at first order , the @xmath52 conversion probability in vacuum is the same at both locations , so the dominant term of the normalized difference of the oscillation probabilities computed at the near and far baselines , @xmath53 , depends linearly on the matter term . up to terms of order @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the expression for @xmath57 reads  @xcite : @xmath58   & + &    \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{a_{\\rm n}^2 l_{\\rm n}^2 - a_{\\rm f}^2 l_{\\rm        f}^2}{4 } \\left (     \\frac{1}{(\\delta_{13 } l / 2)^2 } - \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 \\left ( \\delta_{13 }     l / 2 \\right ) } \\right)~. \\label{eq : probdifffull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as shown in this formula , the corrections due to the cp  violating terms are small as far as @xmath59 because the dominant cp  violating terms in @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which depend upon the vacuum terms , cancel out . as we can clearly see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : probdifffull ] ) , by considering both detectors with the same vacuum oscillation phase , the dependence on the matter potential dominates , with little contamination from other parameters .",
    "thus , the normalized asymmetry is sensitive to the type of hierarchy as the sign of the matter potential term is a direct indication of the sign of the atmospheric mass squared difference .",
    "this is the power of the method , for corrections due to the rest of parameters can modify slightly its value , but can not change its sign .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the determination of @xmath18 was considered and studied in detail with a configuration based on the ( old ) proposal  @xcite with a single running in the neutrino mode .",
    "although , as was shown there , this could be the right way to proceed for the resolution of the mass hierarchy , running in antineutrinos is necessary in order to search for effects due to the cp  violating phase @xmath24 .",
    "hence , in the present study we consider the possibility to run also in the antineutrino channel and we analyze to what extent this opens the possibility to search also for cp  violation in the lepton sector . in an analogous way as for the previous case , we can compute the quantity @xmath62 , i.e. , the cp asymmetry for neutrinos and antineutrino detected at a distance @xmath1 . up",
    "to second order , @xmath63 is given by : @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{eq : probcpsame}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : probcpsame ] ) lies on the fact that , for the energies and baselines of interest , the first two terms in the right - hand - side , the dominant matter effect term and the cp  violating one , are of the same order , with the latter becoming more important as @xmath65 decreases .",
    "this typically introduces an important degeneracy and limits the sensitivity to cp  violation in long - baseline experiments and is the main reason why having two beams of neutrino with different @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but the same @xmath0 , gives better sensitivity to @xmath18 than one neutrino and one antineutrino beam at the same @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence , by placing the second detector in such a configuration , as it will be shown below , the fact that the type of hierarchy could be determined by using the neutrino channel only , solves this degeneracy and improves the sensitivity to cp ",
    "violation when running with antineutrinos .",
    "as has been mentioned above , the idea of exploiting the capabilities of two off - axis detectors , with the same @xmath0 at a single experiment , was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time by using the proposed configuration of the experiment . in that study",
    "it was assumed the use of two liquid argon detectors of 50  kton each , one placed off - axis at 810  km ( the proposed site for ) and the other one off - axis at 200  km ( or 434  km ) , which was named super- .",
    "it was shown that the best capabilities for determining the type of neutrino mass hierarchy were achieved for the case of a near off - axis detector placed at the shortest baseline , i.e. , 200  km , for which the differences in the matter effects with respect to the far detector were larger , and consequently so was the sensitivity to this parameter .",
    "although the development of the liquid argon technology is already quite advanced and has been successfully proven to work in small prototypes  @xcite , it is reasonable to think that the timelines for the experiment might not allow to build such a detector at the far site .",
    "hence , in the present study , keeping the essence of super - no@xmath66a , we consider the use of the currently proposed detector  @xcite at the far site , that is , a low density tracking calorimeter of 30  kton with an efficiency of 24% , and the possibility of building a second off - axis detector at 200  km .    for the detector technologies we consider water - erenkov and liquid argon and study the case of different sizes . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we consider flat efficiencies with no energy dependence , @xmath67 , and backgrounds coming only from the beam .",
    "consequently , one of the relevant statistical parameters is what we define as the _ efficient mass of the detector _ , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the fiducial mass of the detector .",
    "the proposed detector has @xmath70  kton .",
    "we will consider the medium energy configuration of the numi beam and @xmath71 protons on target per year ( pot / yr )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we propose to sequence the experiment such that the first phase uses only the far detector as in the proposal  @xcite . in the second phase , the second detector , the near off - axis one ,",
    "is already constructed and starts taking data .",
    "the choice of adding the second detector should be guided by the knowledge of the value of the mixing angle @xmath3 .",
    "such information can be provided by the experiment itself in the first years of running  @xcite and by other experiments which are expected to run previously  @xcite or at the same time  @xcite . if the angle @xmath3 is beyond the reach of the experiment , adding a second detector would not be useful in determining the type of neutrino mass hierarchy or cp  violation .",
    "conversely , for a sizable value of @xmath3 , we show that constructing a near off - axis detector with the same @xmath0 would allow to determine @xmath18 , ( almost ) free of degeneracies .",
    "the experiment itself has the capability to probe values of @xmath3 down to @xmath72 , within the first 3 years of running  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider first only the far detector and 3 years of neutrino run plus 3 years of antineutrino run . assuming that a positive signal for @xmath73 conversion is found after the first neutrino run , signaling @xmath3 in the interesting range of values , we assume that the second detector is constructed and starts taking data immediately after the antineutrino running period .",
    "following these general guidelines we have considered two different scenarios . in scenario i ( * sci * ) , without proton driver , after the first 6 years with only the detector , we assume other 6 years of neutrino run plus 2 years of antineutrino run . we do this for different values of @xmath74  kton , where the first three values would account for a water - erenkov detector ( 70% efficiency ) of 25 , 50 and 100  kton , whereas the last three values would account for a liquid argon detector ( 90% efficiency ) of 15 , 30 and 50 kton . in scenario",
    "ii ( * scii * ) , the beam is upgraded from the beginning with a proton driver ( @xmath75 pot / yr ) , which is equivalent to multiply @xmath76 by @xmath77 3.85 . during the first 6 years",
    ", only the detector would be taking data .",
    "afterwards , both near and far detectors would take data for 3 years of neutrino run plus 1 year of antineutrino run .",
    "we use the same values of @xmath76 as for * sci*. the total number of years in * sci * ( * scii * ) is of 14 ( 10 ) .",
    "the question that we would like to address is what is the minimum _ efficient mass _ of the near off - axis detector required to ensure the resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy for the full range of values of the cp  violating parameter @xmath24 for a given value of @xmath3 .",
    "we have thus performed a @xmath78 analysis for both @xmath3 and @xmath24 . for a given value of the oscillation parameters ,",
    "we have computed the expected number of electron events , @xmath79 , detected at the possible locations @xmath80 ( near , far sites ) .",

    "the convolution of these three magnitudes are then integrated over a narrow energy window of @xmath88 gev , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 refer to the lower and upper energy limits , respectively . we have divided the total number of events in two bins of equal width @xmath91 gev  . ] .    for our analysis ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will use a representative value of @xmath92 , which lies within the best - fit values for the super - kamiokande  @xcite and k2k  @xcite experiments .",

    "for the remaining oscillation parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 , we will use the best fit values quoted in the introduction .",
    "for the progress in the studies of neutrino physics it is of fundamental importance measuring the value of the small @xmath3 angle , determining the type of neutrino mass hierarchy and searching for possible cp  violation in the neutrino sector .",

    "[ fig:0.09 ] we have only illustrated the case for @xmath110 because this is the value of @xmath24 which gives the worst resolution of @xmath18 for the value of @xmath111 assumed   assumed in the rest of the figures is the one which gives the worst resolution of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy for each value of @xmath112 . ] . hence , it is important to realize that , when one explores the full range of @xmath24 , there exist some values of the cp  violating phase @xmath24 for which the sign of the atmospheric mass difference could be resolved also in a more modest scenario , i.e , a scenario with fewer years of data taking , or a scenario with a smaller detector , or a combination of both cases .",
    "it might certainly happen that nature is kind enough to have chosen a different value for the cp  violating phase .",
    "in that case , the determination of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy would be much easier . here",
    "we present the most pessimistic case . on the other hand , another experiment which may improve the results depicted in fig.[fig:0.09 ] is minos , which could be sensitive to @xmath113 if the total number of protons on target achieves a value of @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "the next step in the study we are presenting here is to assume that the true value of @xmath105 is smaller than the one considered in fig .",

    "[ fig:0.09 ] , but as is evident from the bottom pannel , in this case , when combining the data at the two detectors , the fake solution remains present , although only at the @xmath116 c.l . in this case ,",
    "the value of @xmath24 for which the resolution of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy is most difficult is @xmath117 .",
    "again , let us point out that this happens for this specific value of @xmath24 . hence , for any other value of the cp  violating phase , the results would be even better .",
    "if @xmath118 , in order to eliminate the fake solutions , it is necessary to increase the mass of the near detector .",
    "we show the results for a true value of @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig:0.058 ] and @xmath117 , where we have upgraded the modest 15 kton near detector to a 50 kton water - erenkov detector ( @xmath120 and 35  kton , respectively ) and for @xmath121 and @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ fig:0.043 ] , where the near detector has been upgraded to a 100  kton water - erenkov detector ( @xmath123  kton ) .",
    "we should notice here that for other values of the cp  violating phase @xmath24 a smaller detector would provide the statistics required for resolving the type of hierarchy .",
    "this will be illustrated below by the use of exclusion plots in the ( @xmath104 , @xmath24 ) plane .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      throughout this work we have been assuming a fixed value for @xmath124 . however , the value of this parameter is known currently with a precision of @xmath125 at 90% c.l .  @xcite . in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : probdifffull ] ) , we can see that the value of the asymmetry increases monotonically as the vaccum oscillation phase increases , and therefore the asymmetry is larger for larger @xmath35 .",
    "this correspondingly means better sensitivity to the type of mass hierarchy the larger the atmospheric mass square difference is .",
    "hence , although a precision at the level of @xmath126 is expected to be achieved by the time this experiment could turn on  @xcite , it is very important to investigate the effect of a different value for @xmath35 on the results presented above .",

    "we depict the fraction of @xmath24 for which the type of neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined as a function of @xmath111 , for three different values of @xmath35 = @xmath130 ( dotted line ) ; @xmath131 ( solid line ) and @xmath132 ( dashed line )",
    ". as anticipated , the larger the value of @xmath35 , the better the sensitivity to @xmath18 . as for comparison , for a value of @xmath35 = @xmath133 ,",
    "the results are only slightly better than what is achieved with just the far detector if @xmath35 = @xmath134 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath35 = @xmath135 , the sensitivity is at the level of that for @xmath35 = @xmath131 with four times more statistics , i.e. , a 100  kton water - erenkov detector instead . on the other hand ,",
    "let us point out that since the chooz  @xcite bound is weaker for small values of @xmath35 , the loss in range for @xmath3 is not as large as one would navely think from fig .",
    "[ fig : difdm ] .",
    "hence , if future atmospheric and long - baseline experiments determine that the actual value of @xmath35 happens to be smaller than the one assumed for this work , a different solution must be considered in order to achieve a comparable sensitivity .",
    "a possible solution would be to adopt a larger @xmath0 , which could be accomplished either by considering longer baselines or larger off - axis distances , i.e. , smaller energies .",
    "another possibility would be to consider running with the low - energy configuration of the numi beam .",
    "nevertheless , these modified experimental setups would imply a reduction of the neutrino flux at the detectors , which would require a detailed analysis to evaluate their actual capabilities . on top of this , if @xmath3 is very small and @xmath35 is also small , then the construction of the proton driver and possibly a longer neutrino running would be necessary .",
    "in the previous section we have studied the capabilities for determining the type of neutrino mass hierarchy and of cp violation by adding a second detector to the already proposed far detector for the configuration .",
    "the results obtained are for a super- -like configuration  @xcite , that is with the second detector placed such that ( the peak energy ) has the same @xmath0 of the far detector .",
    "this choice is based on the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite and the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that such a configuration is specially sensitive to matter effects even with only the neutrino run .",
    "interestingly , in the proposal  @xcite , the possibility to add a second detector is pointed out .",
    "the approach there consists in placing the second detector at the second oscillation maximum , where the matter effect is smaller by a factor of three because the energy is smaller by the same factor .",
    "however , for such a configuration there is no cancellation between the vacuum terms at both detectors , and the cp  violating effects are also different ( larger by a factor of three in the second detector for the same reason as above ) .",
    "these facts imply that the matter - dependent terms are of the same order of those carrying information on cp  violation , which makes much more difficult to disentangle the type of mass hierarchy from cp  violating effects .",
    "therefore , a measurement using only a neutrino run would not be as sensitive to the type of neutrino mass spectrum as in the case of super- and a running also in the antineutrino mode would be needed in order to achieve a comparable sensitivity . in addition , going to the second oscillation maximum means going more off - axis , and hence losing flux . in this case",
    "the loss in number of events amounts to about a factor of 15 with respect to the first detector  .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : second ] , we compare these two possibilities for placing the second detector . for illustrative purposes , we have assumed for this comparison the same type of detectors as for super-  @xcite , i.e. , two 50 kton liquid argon tpc .",
    "the results depict the cases without proton driver , where solid lines are for 5 years of neutrino running and dashed lines are for 5 years of neutrino plus 5 years of antineutrino running . as was anticipated above , the configuration for which both detectors are located such that the vacuum oscillation phase is the same ( thick solid magenta lines ) , i.e. , the same @xmath0 , is much better when running only with neutrinos than that with the second detector at the second oscillation maximum ( thin solid blue lines ) . in order to achieve comparable sensitivities for the determination of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy ,",
    "the antineutrino run is necessary for the case of plus a second detector located at the second oscillation maximum ( thin dashed blue line ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of super- the antineutrino information does not add any synergy , but just statistics ( thick dashed magenta line ) .",
    "hence , it is important to note that in order to determine @xmath18 with the second detector at the same @xmath0 , the antineutrino run is not really needed .",
    "as it is well known , provided @xmath111 is in the range accesible to conventional neutrino beams , the unique contribution of the numi neutrino program , and in particular of the experiment  @xcite , will be the resolution of the type of neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "determining the type of neutrino mass hierarchy , whether normal or inverted , constitutes one of the fundamental questions in neutrino physics .",
    "future long - baseline experiments aim at addressing this fundamental issue but suffer typically from degeneracies with other cp  conserving and cp  violating parameters , namely @xmath3 , @xmath24 and @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of such degeneracies limits the sensitivity to the type of hierarchy as well as to cp  violation .",
    "many studies focus on resolving such degeneracies , e.g. by combining more than one experiment  @xcite , using more than one detector  @xcite , or using information from atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we follow the strategy delined in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the type of hierarchy is determined free of degeneracies in only one neutrino experiment with two off - axis detectors and by using the neutrino beam alone .",
    "the off - axis configurations are chosen in such a way that at the two detectors the ratio @xmath0 is the same , and so the vacuum oscillation phases . comparing the probabilities of neutrino conversion at the two distances , the vacuum term ( hence the dominant cp  violating one ) cancels out in the difference  @xcite . the normalized difference @xmath57 depends only on matter effects and its sign",
    "is determined by the type of neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "cp  violating terms can give relevant contributions only for small values of @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that the determination of the type of neutrino mass spectrum , exploiting this method , suffers no degeneracies from other parameters . in the super- proposed configuration ,",
    "two off - axis 50  kton liquid argon detectors , one at a far site and one at a shorter distance @xmath136  km , were used . even if the construction of small liquid argon detectors has proven to be possible",
    ", it might be difficult to build the required large liquid argon detectors on the timescale .",
    "here we have considered a more realistic proposal , in which at the far site the currently proposed detector  @xcite is used .",
    "the second detector should be added off - axis at about 200  km .",
    "we study both liquid argon and water - erenkov tecniques and different sizes for the detectors .",
    "even if establishing the type of hierarchy with this setup does not require antineutrinos , here we consider both neutrino and antineutrino running modes and we analyze the capabilities of determining cp  violation as well .",

    ", the experiment would have just the far off - axis detector as in the proposal  @xcite . in the second phase",
    ", the near off - axis detector is added at 200  km .",
    "we have considered two different scenarios . in scenario i ( * sci * ) the experiment runs with the numi beam for 6 years as in the no@xmath66a proposal and then with a second off - axis detector 6 years in the neutrino mode and 2 with antineutrinos . in scenario",
    "ii ( * scii * ) the beam is upgraded by the use of a proton driver and the number of years of data taking with both detectors is reduced to 3 and 1 for neutrinos and antineutrinos , respectively .",

    "the values of @xmath24 chosen are those that give the worst results , so they represent the most pessimistic case . in particular , for each set of parameters , we depict the sensitivity when each detector , far and near off - axis , is considered alone , and we show how the degeneracies can be lifted when the data at the two locations are combined .",

    "the construction of a larger detector , such as a 100  kton water - erencov one , would have even a more dramatic impact , raising the fraction of @xmath24 to 100% for @xmath142 and to @xmath143 even for @xmath144 . in * scii",
    "* , the higher flux would allow the determination of @xmath18 , _ independently of @xmath24 _",

    "we show the sensitivity to cp - violation at 95%  c.l . in fig .",

    "obviously , also in the case of cp  violation , the sensitivity increases with statistics and improves greatly with respect to the proposed experiment .    from our analysis",
    "it is clear that the choice of building the second detector should be guided by the knowledge of the value of @xmath104 , provided by itself and by other experiments  @xcite . if @xmath146@xmath147 , no sensitivity on the type of mass spectrum could be reached and the construction of a second detector would not improve it significantly . on the contrary , if @xmath148 , a sufficiently large second detector would _ guarantee _ the determination of the type of hierarchy ( almost ) independently of the value of @xmath24 .",
    "the actual type and mass of the second off - axis detector should be chosen on the basis of the measured value of @xmath65 .",
    "as the sensitivity to @xmath18 depends also on the unknown value of @xmath24 , the best strategy would be to build a detector for which the determination of the type of hierarchy can be achieved for a large fraction of values of the cp - violating phase , e.g. 60%70% . in case",
    "we are lucky and nature has chosen a favorable value of @xmath24 , the above discussed number of years of data taking , if not less , would allow to answer this question .",

    "let us notice that the flux at the second location is greatly suppressed by the large off - axis angle , though . in our proposal",
