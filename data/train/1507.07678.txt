    "these fluctuations are most likely driven by large - scale variations in the mean free path , a signature of the trailing edge of the cosmic reionization epoch .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig2 ] , our reionization history is also consistent with the dark pixel fraction observed in the  and  forest of @xmath71 quasars , which provides a model - independent upper limit of @xmath72 at @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the redshift - dependent fraction of color - selected galaxies revealing  emission has become a valuable constraint on the evolving neutrality of the early igm .",
    "we notice here that , in our late reionization model , the hydrogen neutral fraction evolves quite rapidly from redshift 6 ( @xmath74 ) to redshift 8 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this will cause a fast decline of the mean  line transmissivity of the igm and may explain the swift drop observed in the space density of  emitting galaxies at @xmath71 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while a late hydrogen reionization epoch is not a unique feature of an agn - dominated scenario , the early reionization of  is .",
    "traditionally , the peak in luminous quasar activity observed at @xmath9 has been expected to coincide with the end of helium reionization . and while observations of patchy absorption in the  forest at these epochs have been interpreted as signaling the tail end of  reionization at @xmath76 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the large fluctuations in the background radiation field above 4 ryd predicted from the rarity of bright quasars and the relatively short attenuation lengths of euv photons make the interpretation of the  data still controversial",
    ". indeed , rather than complete gunn - peterson absorption at higher redshifts , recent observations have revelead high - transmission regions out to @xmath77 @xcite , in conflict with numerical models of  reionization driven by luminous quasars @xcite . according to @xcite , the observed mild evolution with redshift of  absorption",
    "demands that the bulk of intergalactic helium was already doubly ionized at @xmath78 by a population of early euv sources .",

    "only the most luminous distant quasars can be detected in surveys such as the sdss , leaving the contribution of faint agns to the early ionizing background highly uncertain .",
    "recent multiwavelength deep surveys have suggested the presence of a hitherto unknown population of faint agns @xcite and have prompted a reexamination of the role played by agns in the reionization of the igm .",
    "we have expanded on previous studies and assessed a model in which the uv radiation responsible for the reionization of hydrogen and helium in the universe arises entirely from quasars and active galaxies .",
    "we have assumed here that normal star - forming galaxies will make only a negligible contribution to the agn lyc emissivity given in equation ( [ eqemiss ] ) , which is true provided their globally - averaged escape fraction does not exceed a few percent or so ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "compared to the standard picture widely discussed in the literature , the agn - dominated scenario examined in this work completes hydrogen reionization late ( @xmath83 ) , double helium reionization early ( @xmath84 ) , and produces a low electron scattering optical depth that is consistent with the planck value at the @xmath68 level .",
    "it may provide an explanation to some otherwise puzzling recent findings , from the rapid decline of the space density of  emitting galaxies observed at @xmath71 , to an igm whose temperature is found to increase from redshift 5 to 2 and where  appears to be predominantly ionized at @xmath85 .",
    "it is , of course , a model that is also plagued by a number of uncertanties regarding the properties of faint agns ( their space densities and euv spectra at high-@xmath86 ) , and of the early igm ( its temperature and clumpiness ) .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , a critical assumption is the high escape fraction of ionizing radiation needed for the global agn population to dominate reionization .",
    "while no discernible continuum edge at 912   is seen in a composite fuv spectrum of 159 @xmath87 quasars and active galaxies obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) @xcite , it is uncler whether escape fractions of order unity are also typical of fainter , higher redshift agns .",
    "the model is also somewhat sensitive to @xmath52 , the `` formation epoch '' of the earliest agns . here",

    "hydrogen reionization would only be completed by @xmath89 .    as a corroboration of the slowly evolving lyc emissivity adopted in this work",
    ", we have run a modified version of our radiative transfer code cuba @xcite to estimate the intensity and spectrum of the filtered ionizing background  specifically the hydrogen photoionization rate @xmath90  predicted by our agn - dominated scenario , @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the angle - averaged monochromatic intensity , @xmath93 is the planck constant , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the hydrogen photoionization cross section and ionizing threshold frequency .",
    "we have computed the background ionizing intensity @xmath96 using the emissivity in equation ( [ eqemiss ] ) , a euv spectrum with @xmath54 , and a new a piecewise parameterization of the distribution in redshift and column density of intergalactic absorbers that fits the measurements of the mean free path of 1 ryd photons by @xcite .",
    "the results , shown in figure [ fig3 ] , are in formal agreement with empirical determinations of @xmath90 in the interval @xmath3 based on the  opacity of the igm @xcite .",
    "note that , in the traditional view , the slowly evolving emissivity needed to reproduce the  opacity data can only be achieved by carefully tuning the escape fraction from star - forming galaxies to increase rapidly with lookback time , so as to compensate for the decline in the star formation activity towards early epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in our agn - dominated scenario , the heat input from helium reionization will start dominating the thermal balance of the igm earlier than in the standard picture . in figure [ fig4 ]",

    "the formula above should provide the correct mean heating rate of intergalactic gas once the background intensity @xmath92 is properly reprocessed while propagating through the igm @xcite .",
    "photoheating exceeds the hydrogen term by nearly a factor of three .",
    "measurements of the igm temperature evolution from redshift 5 to 2 derived from the  forest have been known to be inconsistent with the mononotic decrease with redshift expected after the completion of hydrogen reionization @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be solved by the additional heating provided by an earlier and more extended period of  reionization .",
    "the population of faint , high redshift agns invoked here should leave an imprint on the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "@xcite derived a value of @xmath103 to the @xmath104kev unresolved xrb .",
    "the expected contribution at 2 kev from agns above redshift @xmath105 can be estimated as @xcite @xmath106 where the specific comoving emissivity at 2 kev is related to the lyc emissivity by @xmath107 here , @xmath108 is the optical - to - x - ray spectral index needed to join the emissivity at 2500  with that at 2 kev , and @xmath109 is a correction factor that accounts for the possible contribution of uv obscured (  type ii \" ) agns at @xmath110 to the observed xrb . using @xmath31 as before , @xmath111 @xcite , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 @xcite we obtain @xmath115 , i.e. a contribution of nearly 60% to the unresolved xrb . we find that @xmath6 active galaxies can reionize the universe without overproducing the unresolved xrb provided their properties ( i.e. fraction of obscured objects , optical - to - x - ray spectral indices ) are similar to those of their lower redshift counterparts ( cf . * ? ? ?",
