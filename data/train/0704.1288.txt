    "@xcite with a direct band gap of 1.8  ev , cdse quantum dots have been used for laser diodes  @xcite , nanosensing  @xcite , and biomedical imaging .",
    "@xcite in fundamental research , particles with a diameter in the 1 - 5  nm range are of particular importance since they cover the transition regime between the bulk and molecular domains where quantum size effects play an important role .",
    "significant deviation from bulk properties are expected for particles with diameter below 5  nm , and were observed in many cases  @xcite as well as in this study .",
    "accurate determination of atomic scale structure , homogeneous and inhomogeneous strain , structural defects and geometrical particle parameters such as diameter and shape , are important for understanding the fundamental mechanisms and processes in nanostructured materials .",
    "however , difficulties are experienced when standard methods are applied to small nanoparticles . in this domain",
    "the presumption of a periodic solid , which is the basis of a crystallographic analysis , breaks down .",
    "quantitative determinations of the nanoparticle structure require methods that go beyond crystallography .",
    "this was noted early on in a seminal study by bawendi _",

    "@xcite where they used the debye equation , which is not based on a crystallographic assumption , to simulate semi - quantitatively the scattering from some cdse nanoparticles .",
    "however , despite the importance of knowing the nanoparticle structure quantitatively with high accuracy , this work has not been followed up with application of modern local structural methods  @xcite until recently .",
    "@xcite in this study we return to the archetypal cdse nanoparticles to investigate the extent of information about size - dependent structure of nanoparticles from the atomic pair distribution function ( pdf ) method .",
    "this is a local structural technique that yields quantitative structural information on the nanoscale from x - ray and neutron powder diffraction data .",
    "@xcite recent developments in both data collection  @xcite and modeling  @xcite make this a potentially powerful tool in the study of nanoparticles .",
    "additional extensions to the modelling are necessary for nanoparticles , and some of these have been successfully demonstrated .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present a detailed analysis of the structural information available from pdf data on ( 2 - 4  nm ) cdse nanoparticles .",
    "the pdf method is demonstrated here as a key tool that can yield precise structural information about the nanoparticles such as the atomic structure size of the core , the degree of crystallinity , local bonding , the degree of the internal disorder and the atomic structure of the core region , as a function of the nanoparticle diameter .",
    "three cdse nanoparticle samples with different diameters that exhibit different optical spectra have been studied .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not only to explain the pdf data of cdse nanoparticles through a modeling process , but also to systematically investigate the sensitivity of the pdf data to subtle structural modifications in nanoparticles relative to bulk material .",
    "the measurement of the nanoparticle size can lead to significantly different results when performed by different methods , and there is no consensus as to which is the most reliable .",
    "@xcite it is also not clear that a single diameter is sufficient to fully specify even a spherical particle since the presence of distinct crystalline core and disordered surface regions have been postulated .",
    "@xcite    powder diffraction is a well established method for structural and analytical studies of crystalline materials , but the applicability to such small particles of standard powder diffraction based on crystallographic methods is questionable and likely to be semi - quantitative at best .",

    "@xcite there have been some reports  @xcite in the past few years extracting nanoparticle diameter from x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using the scherrer formula , which is a phenomenological approach that considers the finite size broadening of bragg - peaks .",
    "@xcite this approach will decrease in accuracy with decreasing particle size , and for particle sizes in the range of a few nanometers the notion of a bragg peak becomes moot .",
    "@xcite at this point the debye formula  @xcite becomes the more appropriate way to calculate the scattering .",
    "@xcite the inconsistency between the nanoparticle diameter determined from the standard characterization methods and the diameter obtained by applying the scherrer formula have been observed by several authors .",
    "@xcite    previous studies of cdse nanoparticle structure have demonstrated the sensitivity of the xrd pattern to the presence of planar disorder and thermal effects due to nano - size effects .  @xcite the diffraction patterns of cdse nanoparticles",

    "a technique that takes both bragg and diffuse scattering need to be used , such as the pdf technique . here",
    "we apply the pdf method to study the structure , size and strain in cdse nanoparticles as a function of nanoparticle diameter .",
    "the core structure of the cdse nanoparticles can be described by a mixture of crystalline structures intermediate between zinc - blend and wurtzite , which is wurtzite containing a stacking fault density ( sfd ) of up to @xmath5% , with no clear evidence of a disordered surface region , certainly down to 3  nm diameter .",

    "cdse nanoparticles were synthesized from cadmium acetate , selenium , trioctyl phosphine and trioctyl phosphine oxide .",
    "sixty four grams of trioctylphosphine oxide ( topo ) containing cadmiumacetate was heated to 360@xmath6c under flowing argon .",
    "cold stock solution ( 38.4  ml ) of ( se : trioctylphosphine  =  2:100 by mass ) was quickly injected into the rapidly stirred , hot topo solution .",
    "the temperature was lowered to 300@xmath6c by the injection . at various time intervals ,",
    "5 - 10  ml aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and precipitated in 10  ml of methanol .",

    "the diameter of the cdse nanoparticles was extracted from the pdf data and is in good agreement with the diameter obtained from standard characterization methods , indicating that within our measurement uncertainties , there is no significant heavily disordered surface region in these nanoparticles , even at the smallest diameter of 2  nm .",
    "in contrast with zns nanoparticles  @xcite where the heavily disordered surface region is about 40% of the nanoparticle diameter for a diameter of 3.4  nm , the surface region thickness being around 1.4  nm .",
    "@xcite    compared with the bulk pdf , the nanoparticle pdf peaks are broader in the high-@xmath7 region due to strain and structural defects in the nanoparticles .",
    "the nearest neighbor peaks at @xmath8   which come from covalently bonded cd - se pairs , shorten as nanoparticle diameter decreases resulting in a size - dependent strain on the cd - se bond that reaches 0.5% at the smallest particle size .",
