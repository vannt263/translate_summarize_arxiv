    "the mechanical status of granular matter is presently one of the most open and debated issues @xcite .",
    "this state of matter exhibits many unusual mechanical and rheological properties such as stress induced organization at the microscopic @xcite or at the mesoscopic @xcite level which may yield macroscopic effects such as stress induced anisotropy @xcite .",
    "this issue sets fundamental questions relevant to the understanding of many other systems exhibiting jamming such as dense colloids or more generally soft glassy materials @xcite . for practical applications ,",
    "the quasistatic rheology of granular assemblies is described using a phenomenological approach , based on an elasto - plastic modelling of stress - strain relations @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no consensus on how to express correctly the macroscopic constitutive relations solely out of microscopic considerations and under various boundary conditions or loading histories .",
    "this very basic issue was illustrated in a recent debate on how to understand the stress distribution below a sand pile and especially how to account for the dependence on preparation protocols @xcite .",
    "a new mechanical approach was proposed based on the concept of  fragile matter  @xcite and force chains propagation modelling @xcite .",
    "but recent experiments have dismissed this approach and evidenced results more consistent with the traditional framework of general elasticity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the predictions for stresses measurements at the bottom for an elastic material confined in a rigid cylinder .",
    "when the column is filled with granular material it corresponds to the classical janssen s problem @xcite .",
    "recently , this issue has received a lot of attention either experimentally @xcite or numerically @xcite , the confined material being either pushed or pulled down .",
    "surprisingly , so far to our knowledge , there are very few systematic comparison or even direct relation with the outcome of standard elasticity in the same situation of confinement .",
    "note that experimentally , it was found that essentially elastic materials like gels , may display a janssen stress saturation effects that could well predict the onset of self - collapsing under gravity @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite , evesque and",
    "de gennes proposed a model for the slow filling of an elastic medium modelling a granular packing .",
    "as the material is poured in the column , displacements of the material at the bottom are induced by the weight of the new material added so that it mobilizes friction forces . within the assumption of a minimal anchorage length",
    ", it leads to partial and inhomogeneous mobilization of friction at the walls : friction is fully mobilized at the bottom , and partially in the upper part of the column .",
    "a janssen like pressure profile can be derived in the case where the saturation length @xmath0 is high compared to the column radius @xmath1 ; this last condition is actually restrictive and inappropriate for usual experimental cases @xcite .",
    "we propose to study in detail the elastic predictions and to compare them to the janssen model and to experimental results for a granular material in _ the same situation _",
    "i.e. when the material is at the coulomb threshold _ everywhere _ at the walls .",
    "the main comparison features with the experimental results have already been presented in @xcite ; here , we detail much more the elastic predictions .    two kinds of situations are considered .",
    "first , the mass at the bottom of the column is measured as a function of the material filling mass .",
    "second , similar measurements are produced with an overweight on the top of the material .",
    "we recently performed the corresponding experiments for a granular material @xcite and it was shown that one could obtain quite reproducible data provided a good control of the packing fraction homogeneity and a polarization of all the friction forces at the walls in the upwards direction .",
    "our measurements confirmed , for the first time , the general validity of janssen s saturation curve .",
    "they also evidenced an overshoot effect of spectacular amplitude induced by a top mass equal to the saturation mass .",
    "these experimental results are actually strong tests for any theory of granular matter .",
    "we first summarize our recent experimental results @xcite and compare them to the janssen model predictions . in @xcite , a slightly polydisperse assembly of 1.5 mm glass beads was poured at controlled packing fraction in steel columns of various friction coefficient , and of diameter varying between 38 mm and 80 mm .",
    "the aim of the experimental procedure is to achieve the coulomb threshold everywhere at the walls when the apparent mass @xmath2 is measured ; see @xcite for details on the procedure .",
    "the apparent mass @xmath2 measured at the bottom of the column was plotted as a function of the filling mass @xmath3 of the material .",
    "the typical results obtained when @xmath3 is varied are shown on fig .",
    "the apparent mass @xmath2 saturates exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "when an overweight equal to the saturation mass @xmath4 is added on top of the granular material , @xmath2 increases with @xmath3 , up to a maximum @xmath5 , which is about @xmath6 higher than @xmath4 , then decreases slowly towards the saturation mass @xmath4 .",
    "the simple model which captures the physics of this saturation phenomenon was provided in 1895 by janssen @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the equilibrium of a granular slice taken at the onset of sliding everywhere at the walls ; we attempted to realize as best as possible this last condition in our experiment @xcite . in cylindrical coordinates with origin at the top surface and the cylinder axis being the @xmath7 axis , the relation , at the slipping onset , between the shear stress @xmath8 and the horizontal stress @xmath9 at the walls is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the coulomb static friction coefficient between the grains and the walls .",
    "it results in a relation between the filling mass @xmath3 and the apparent mass at the bottom @xmath2 of the form : @xmath12 with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass density of the granular material , and @xmath15 is the janssen parameter rendering the average horizontal redirection of vertical stresses : @xmath16 from a mechanical point of view , a major simplification of this model comes from the assumption that the redirection parameter @xmath15 would stay constant along the vertical direction .",
    "but on the other hand , it provides a clear and simple physical explanation for the existence of an effective screening length @xmath0 @xmath17 above which the mass weighted at the bottom saturates .    in @xcite ,",
    "several saturation profiles were measured for various packing fractions , columns sizes and friction coefficients between the grains and the walls .",
    "when the apparent mass rescaled by the saturation mass is plotted as a function of the filling mass also rescaled by the saturation mass , we obtain a _",
    "universal rescaling _ of all data on a curve which is precisely the one predicted by janssen ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "the rescaling with radius @xmath1 and friction coefficient @xmath11 was also checked , and good agreement with the janssen model rescaling was found .",
    "the janssen constant @xmath15 was found to depend on packing fraction @xmath20 and an effective relation was derived : @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , when a top mass equal to the saturation mass is added on the top of the granular material , the apparent mass @xmath2 displays a maximum @xmath5 @xmath6 higher than @xmath4 , whereas the janssen model predicts @xmath22 whatever the filling mass @xmath3 is .",
    "therefore , this overshoot goes beyond the possibilities of janssen s model which seems adapted to a unique configuration .    in the next section",
    ", we study in detail the predictions of isotropic homogeneous elasticity .",
    "we first recall the general framework of homogeneous isotropic elasticity , and then predict the behavior of an elastic material confined in a column .",
    "the elastic theory gives , in the limit of small deformations , a linear relation between the stress tensor components @xmath23 and the strain tensor components @xmath24 .",
    "for an isotropic elastic material , we get @xmath25 where e is the young modulus , and @xmath26 the poisson ratio which takes its value between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in 3d , and between -1 and 1 in 2d .    in a uniaxial homogeneous compression experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , where @xmath29 is imposed everywhere , the other stress tensor components being null , we get @xmath30 everywhere and @xmath31 which signifies that the material expands in the transverse direction.the young modulus @xmath32 is thus characteristic of the material s stiffness ; a cylinder of length @xmath33 and section @xmath34 has stiffness @xmath35 in the axial direction .",
    "the poisson ratio is linked to the material compressibility : the volume variation is : @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , an incompressible material has poisson ratio @xmath28 in 3d ( 1 in 2d ) .",
    "if we now confine an elastic medium of young modulus @xmath32 and poisson ratio @xmath26 , in a rigid cylinder of radius @xmath1 , no more radial displacement at the walls is allowed : @xmath37 .",
    "stresses and displacements can actually be calculated in the _ limit of high depths @xmath7 _ under the assumption that they then should be independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the boundary conditions we impose are the coulomb condition everywhere at the walls @xmath38 and infinitely rigid walls i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "the stress tensor components are then @xmath40 and the asymptotic displacements are @xmath41 this can be checked by injecting this solution in the stress - strain relation ( [ stressstrain ] ) and internal equilibrium relation @xmath42    thus , we obtain a janssen s like redirection phenomenon due to a poisson s ratio effect with a local janssen s parameter @xmath43 , being for large depths : @xmath44 at 2d , we obtain the same saturation and stress redirection phenomena with @xmath45 .    for a free elastic medium ,",
    "the poisson ratio effect is a transverse dilatation ; for a confined elastic material , the poisson ratio effect is a transverse redirection of stresses ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in the following",
    ", @xmath46 will design the elastic stress redirection constant , whereas @xmath15 is devoted to design the stress redirection constant in the janssen framework .    in this section",
    ", we obtained the asymptotic values of stresses and displacements . for the vertical stress ,",
    "the limit is similar to the janssen asymptotic vertical stress if one identifies @xmath15 an @xmath46 .",
    "but we can not say anything from this calculation about the whole pressure profile .",
    "we thus need to perform numerical computation . in the next section",
    ", we present the numerical methods we employed to simulate janssen experiments for an elastic column .",
    "two different methods were employed : we first computed the stresses in 2d with a spring lattice .",
    "we also computed the stresses in 3d , using finite element method thanks to cast3 m @xcite .",
    "the 2d computations are performed in order to provide elastic predictions for a direct comparison with 2d simulations of granular materials .    in order to avoid any confusion ,",
    "let us recall that we are not trying here to give a microscopic model for a granular material , but we use a discrete system behaving like an effective elastic medium in the continuous limit in order to perform simple numerical simulations .    however , this system can describe the most simple of granular materials : a 2d hexagonal piling of frictionless disks ( with non - hertzian contacts so that contact elasticity is linear ) .",
    "note also that systems of springs have been recently studied by goldenberg and goldhirsch @xcite ; they showed that large forces inhomogeneities ( i.e. like forces chains ) can be found at the discrete scale in these systems , which are elastic in the continuous limit .",
    "in order to simulate a 2d elastic medium , we put point masses @xmath47 on an hexagonal lattice of link size @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "every particle is linked to her 6 neighbors with identical springs of stiffness @xmath49 and length @xmath48 at rest .",
    "therefore , the potential interaction energy between particles placed at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( such that @xmath52 ) at rest , submitted to infinitesimal displacements @xmath53 and @xmath54 , is : @xmath55    by varying the stiffness @xmath49 , we can only vary the young modulus @xmath32 of the effective elastic medium . as we also need to vary the poisson ratio @xmath56 , an elastic torsion potential between neighbor springs separated by angle @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is added : @xmath58 this potential tries to maintain an angle @xmath59 between 2 neighbors springs if @xmath60 .",
    "thus the limit @xmath61 corresponds to a contractive medium of poisson ratio -1 , whereas the limit @xmath62 corresponds to a incompressible medium .",
    "an elementary area @xmath63 can be associated to each particle .",
    "the surface energy @xmath64 then reads : @xmath65    if we consider the continuum limit of this system , the displacement of a particle located at @xmath51 is : @xmath66 the surface potential energy can be easily computed at second order in @xmath67 , and one obtains : @xmath68    for an elastic medium , stress - strain linearity reads @xmath69    there are _ a priori _ 9 independent parameters in @xmath70 ( but only 2 if it is an isotropic elastic medium ) .",
    "the surface energy then reads @xmath71    if we identify this energy to the one we obtained for the spring lattice , we see that our system , in the continuous limit , is an isotropic elastic medium of young modulus e and poisson ratio @xmath26 : @xmath72    in order to solve the equilibrium problem of the lattice , we need to express the internal forces",
    ". they can be deduced from the surface energy ( [ omega ] ) : to the usual elastic forces due to compression ( or decompression ) of springs , add forces which tends to drive the triangles angles to their equilibrium value ( if @xmath60 ) or out of the @xmath59 value ( if @xmath73 ) .",
    "the force on a , due to the out of equilibrium angles of triangle abc ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) reads : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the rotation matrix of angle @xmath57 .    for the numerical computation",
    ", we impose the balance of forces ( gravity , elastic forces , torsion forces ) everywhere . at the bottom",
    ", we impose a null vertical displacement ( rigid bottom ) , and either a perfectly stick ( i.e. nullity of horizontal displacement ) or perfectly slip ( i.e. nullity of horizontal projection of forces ) bottom . at the walls , we impose a null horizontal displacement ( rigid wall ) , and we impose the coulomb condition : the forces projected vertically are proportional to the forces projected horizontally with proportionality factor @xmath11 . on top of the material ,",
    "the forces projected horizontally are null ( perfectly slip overweight ) , and the overweight is simulated by imposing the same vertical displacement for each particle on top ( stiff overweight ) , which is close to the experimental situation .",
    "we thus obtain a linear system on the point displacements .",
    "we can vary stiffness @xmath49 and @xmath76 in order to simulate elastic mediums of different young modulus and poisson ratio .",
    "note that for varying @xmath26 between 0 and 1 , we need to vary @xmath76 between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we also vary the friction at the walls @xmath11 .      in order to get the whole stress saturation curve ,",
    "finite element numerical simulations @xcite were performed .",
    "the column is modelled as an isotropic elastic medium .",
    "we vary the friction at the walls @xmath11 , the young modulus @xmath32 and the poisson ratio @xmath26 .",
    "we imposed a rigid ( nullity of vertical displacements ) , either perfectly stick ( nullity of horizontal displacements ) or perfectly slip ( nullity of horizontal stresses ) bottom .",
    "we found no appreciable difference between these two previous cases .",
    "the condition @xmath79 is imposed everywhere at the walls .",
    "the cylinder is modelled as a steel elastic medium .",
    "we verified that in all the simulations performed , there is no traction in the elastic medium , so that this can actually be a model for a granular material .",
    "for the simulations performed without overweight , the top surface is set free ( no stress ) ; the overweight is modelled as a perfectly slip ( no horizontal stress ) brass elastic medium .    in order to impose the coulomb condition at the walls",
    ", we first set @xmath80 at each point of the mesh at the walls ; we then obtain in these conditions the value @xmath81 exerted by the elastic medium on the walls .",
    "we then iterate in order to obtain @xmath82 where @xmath11 is the friction coefficient at the walls : the vertical force imposed at step ( i+1 ) is : @xmath83 we choose @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure ensures convergence towards the coulomb condition : if at step ( i ) the coulomb condition @xmath85 is fulfilled , then at step ( i+1 ) : @xmath86 .",
    "this boundary condition is the same as the one at step ( i ) : this yields @xmath87 , and thus @xmath88 .",
    "note that in these simulations we imposed the coulomb condition everywhere at the walls .",
    "this allows comparison with the janssen model in the same situation .",
    "but , regarding the experimental results @xcite , i ) nothing really insures that our piling preparation is strictly isotropic and ii ) in spite of the careful procedure , we are never absolutely sure that all the friction forces at the wall are actually mobilized upwards",
    ". moreover , the modelling of the contacts may seem rudimentary , as elasticity of contact should be included .    in these simulations",
    ", imposing dynamical friction at the walls or the static coulomb threshold is actually the same : the material obeys the same equilibrium equations ( if we consider a steady sliding at the walls ) , and the same condition at the walls , with just a change in the name ( and the experimental value ) of the friction coefficient .",
    "in this section , we present the results obtained from numerical computations at 2d and 3d .    in the following ,",
    "we vary mainly the friction coefficient , and the poisson ratio .",
    "the 2d simulations are in arbitrary units .",
    "the 3d simulations were all performed , if no contrary mention , for an isotropic elastic medium of mass density @xmath89 ( which corresponds to an assembly of glass beads of packing fraction @xmath90 ) , of young modulus 100 mpa , in a steel cylinder of radius @xmath91 cm , poisson ratio 0.3 , young modulus 210 gpa , and thickness 3 mm .",
    "these data , which correspond to the display used in @xcite , will not be specified anymore in the following .",
    "simulations will also be performed in order to study the influence of the variation of the cylinder radius and the young modulus of the elastic medium .",
    "we first perform simulations similar to the original janssen experiment : we plot the weight at the bottom as a function of the weight of elastic material in the column ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    ; the friction at the walls is @xmath92 .",
    "the data are fitted by a janssen curve of coefficient @xmath93 ( line ) .",
    "the janssen curve for @xmath15 corresponding to the elastic stress redirection constant @xmath94 is also displayed ( dotted line).,width=302 ]    we see on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for friction coefficient @xmath92 and poisson ratio @xmath95 , that the apparent mass @xmath2 saturates exponentially with the filling mass .",
    "the data are perfectly fitted by the janssen model for these parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , but the janssen coefficient @xmath15 extracted from the fit is @xmath96 higher than the elastic stress redirection constant @xmath97 .",
    "this is _ a priori _ unexpected as the elastic saturation pressure and the janssen one should be identical with @xmath98 .      in order to understand this feature",
    ", we study the whole mean vertical pressure profile in the same column ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "( squares ) ; the friction at the walls is @xmath92 .",
    "depth @xmath99 cm corresponds to the top of the column .",
    "depth @xmath100 cm corresponds to the bottom .",
    "we display the integral of vertical stresses @xmath101 at height @xmath7 .",
    "the data are compared to a janssen curve of coefficient @xmath102 corresponding to the elastic stress redirection constant ( dotted line).,width=302 ]    regarding mean vertical pressure , we see that the asymptotic value is now the expected theoretical asymptotic value , and the janssen curve with @xmath98 gives a good though not perfect fit of the profile",
    ". the pressure saturates at high depths but decreases suddenly near the bottom ; this is actually the value on the bottom we measure in a janssen experiment .",
    "this feature explains why the saturation mass is lower than the expected one on fig .",
    "the reason for this change of pressure near the bottom is that the asymptotic vertical displacement is parabolic whereas the bottom is rigid and imposes a flat displacement .",
    "it is thus important to note that the usual janssen experiment , in which one measure is made for one given height , is not equivalent to measuring a pressure profile , and results in a lower saturation stress ( i.e. higher janssen s constant @xmath15 ) than the pressure profile . for more clarity on this last point ,",

    "the numerical simulations show that stresses at the bottom also exhibits an overshoot when the column depth is increased .",
    "the relative value of the overshoot is at most 7% .",
    "we propose a scaling relation of the overshoot amplitude when the wall fiction is varied .",
    "this result contrasts with a janssen s analysis where a flat profile should be observed .",
    "this overshoot effect is related to the deformation of the elastic medium below the overweight which sets a length where the deformation profile is not parabolic any more as in the rest ( more like a flat profile as it is imposed by the overweight boundary condition ) .",
    "but at the quantitative level , the overshoot effect found experimentally has an amplitude about 20 to 30 times larger !",
    "this lack of quantitative agreement opens new questions on the modification on the influence of the medium due to the overload .",
    "this is the reason why we push further the investigation in the context of anisotropic elasticity .",
    "we consider an orthotropic elastic medium with the main stiff direction along the vertical . in this case",
    "the effective janssen s redirection coefficient can be changed according to the stiffness ratio but the overshoot test does not produce an overshoot value significantly larger than the isotropic situation .",
    "finally , we propose a qualitative model based on an extension of the janssen s approach where we assume that the overload has changed the medium within a given depth such as to yield a smaller janssen s constant .",
    "this would be consistent with the onset of strain induced anisotropy producing a stiffer medium in the vertical direction .",
    "the agreement of this simple model ( with two fitting parameters ) is satisfactory but more importantly it raises interesting questions and calls for new experimental work . in this frame of mind",
    "it would be very interesting to see differences of the stress saturation curve for two media prepared i ) with a regular rain like pouring as before and ii ) a rain like deposition process but where an overweight is imposed above each deposition step ( a deposition step being of a height much smaller than the final height ) . in this case",
    "the stress induced texture changes could provide a rational explanation to the extension of the janssen s model that fits correctly the overweight experiments ."
