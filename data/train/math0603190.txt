    "historically , much of the development of riemannian geometry has been driven by general relativity .",
    "this theory models spacetime as a lorentzian manifold , which is analogous to a riemannian manifold except that the positive definite metric is replaced by a metric with signature @xmath0 . not only is lorentzian geometry similar to riemannian geometry in many respects but also riemannian manifolds arise naturally as submanifolds of lorentzian manifolds .",
    "physical considerations then give rise to conjectures in riemannian geometry .",
    "recent examples of results inspired by such conjectures include the mass positivity theorem ( schoen and yau , @xcite , @xcite ) and the penrose inequality ( bray , @xcite , huisken and ilmanen , @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the effort involved in learning lorentzian geometry is minimal once one has mastered riemannian geometry .",
    "it therefore seems strange that many mathematicians ( even geometers ) choose not to do so .",
    "this may be in part due to the fact that most introductions to general relativity start from first principles , developing the required differential geometry tools at length , and mostly focus on physical implications of the theory .",
    "a mathematician might prefer a shorter introduction to the subject from a more advanced starting point , focusing on interesting mathematical ideas .",
    "this paper aims to provide such an introduction , leading to a nontrivial result  the simplest of the hawking - penrose singularity theorems ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these theorems basically state that physically reasonable lorentzian manifolds ( in a precise mathematical sense ) must be singular ( i.e. geodesically incomplete ) .",
    "since the motions of free - falling particles are represented by geodesics , this has the physical interpretation that general relativity can not be a complete description of nature .",
    "the paper is divided into three sections .",
    "the first section contains basic ideas of general relativity and lorentzian geometry : timelike , spacelike and null vectors and curves , matter models , the einstein equation and its simplest solutions .",
    "causality theory is developed in the second section , where we discuss time orientation , chronological and causal future and past sets , local causal structure , local maximizing properties of timelike geodesics ( the twin paradox ) , the chronology condition , stable causality , domains of dependence and global hyperbolicity .",
    "the third section contains the proof of the singularity theorem .",
    "the proof has three ingredients : the first is that timelike geodesics cease to maximize the distance to a given time slice @xmath1 once a conjugate point is reached .",
    "the second is that , under a physically reasonable condition ( the strong energy condition ) , conjugate points always occur .",
    "the third is that a length maximizing geodesic connecting @xmath1 to any given point @xmath2 always exists in a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold .",
    "this is the most difficult ( and mathematically interesting ) point to prove ; the proof is achieved by showing that the set of timelike curves connecting @xmath1 to @xmath2 with the hausdorff metric is a compact space where the length functional is upper semicontinuous .",
    "we assume the reader to be familiar with elementary riemannian geometry ( as in @xcite ) and point set topology ( as in @xcite ) . for the reader",
    "whose interest is aroused by this short introduction , there are many excellent texts on general relativity , usually containing also the relevant differential and lorentzian geometry .",
    "these range from introductory ( @xcite ) to more advanced ( @xcite ) to encyclopedic ( @xcite ) .",
    "more mathematically oriented treatments can be found in @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite also contains a brief glance at pseudo - riemannian geometry ) .",
    "causality and the singularity theorems are treated in greater detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "general relativity is the physical theory of space , time and gravitation .",
    "it models spacetime ( i.e. the set of all physical events ) as a @xmath3-dimensional lorentzian manifold ( spacetimes with different numbers of dimensions are also considered , e.g. in string theory ) .    an @xmath4-dimensional * pseudo - riemannian manifold * is a pair @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an @xmath4-dimensional differentiable manifold and @xmath7 is a symmetric , nondegenerate @xmath8-tensor field on @xmath6 ( called the * metric * ) .",

    "( levi - civita ) * let @xmath5 be a pseudo - riemannian manifold . then there exists a unique symmetric affine connection compatible with the metric .    in particular , a lorentzian",
    "manifold comes equipped with geodesics .",
    "the levi - civita connection of minkowski space is the trivial connection , and its geodesics are straight lines .    on the other hand ,",
    "the minus sign in the signature does introduce many novel features to lorentzian geometry .",

    "therefore , timelike curves represent motions of material particles .",
    "timelike geodesics , on the other hand , represent straight line motions with constant speed , i.e. motions of * free * particles .",
    "in addition , the length @xmath32 of a timelike curve @xmath33 \\to m$ ] is interpreted as the * proper time * measured by the particle between events @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "this first step , however , is just the easy half of the problem . to complete the theory",
