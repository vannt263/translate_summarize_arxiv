    "correlations play a key role both in classical and quantum physics . in particular the study of correlations",
    "is crucial in many - body physics and classical and quantum statistical physics .",
    "recently , it turned out that correlations play prominent role in quantum information theory and many modern applications of quantum technologies and there are dozens of papers dealing with this problem ( for the recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we analyze a new measure  so called @xmath0-correlations  and the quantum discord .",

    "it is shown that surprisingly a separable state may be more correlated that an entangled one . analyzing simple examples of bell diagonal states",
    "we illustrate the behavior of various measures of correlations .",
    "we also provide an introduction to bi - partite states and entanglement mappings introduced by belavkin and ohya and recall basic notions from classical and quantum information theory .",
