    "the inflationary cosmological model is the standard paradigm of modern cosmology because an inflationary expansion in the very early universe solves various problems in the standard big bang cosmology  @xcite and also provides the seed of large scale structure in our universe from the quantum fluctuation of an inflaton field @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the property of the generated density fluctuation from a single - field slow - roll inflation model , namely adiabatic , gaussian , and its almost scale - invariant spectrum , is quite consistent with various cosmological observations .",
    "as the scalar perturbation is generated from the inflaton s quantum fluctuation during inflationary expansion , the tensor perturbation also is generated from graviton s one  @xcite .",
    "the tensor perturbation induces @xmath3-mode polarization of the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation and is important for inflationary cosmology because the tensor perturbation directly tells us the energy scale of inflation .",
    "recently , the bicep2 collaboration reported the detection of the tensor mode through the @xmath3-mode polarization with the corresponding tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xcite @xmath4 its cosmological implications also have been studied  @xcite .",
    "it has been well known that theoretically such a large tensor - to - scalar ratio can be generated only by so - called large field models , where its potential , as of a polynomial function of @xmath2 , is convex and the variation of the inflaton field value during inflation @xmath5 is as large as of the planck scale  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the planck satellite  @xcite has reported the scalar spectral index as @xmath6 now , if we compare the central values of eqs .",
    "( [ rt : bicep ] ) and ( [ ns : planck ] ) with the predicted values of well - studied potential models such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 , there is a discrepancy .",
    "namely , @xmath9 from @xmath7 is too low and that from @xmath8 is too high  @xcite .",
    "potential would well agree with data .",
    "however , naively , this potential is pathological because the potential is not bounded from below .",
    "note , however , an effective realization would be possible with a field redefinition from @xmath10 . ]    in this paper , we extend analysis to general polynomial models of inflation for which the potential is expressed as  @xcite @xmath11 to examine whether this form of potential can reconcile the mismatch mentioned above , by taking the latest bicep2 data into account .",
    "since it is not easy to control so many parameters , in practice , we will consider terms up to @xmath8 , which might be motivated by the renormalizability of quantum field theory .",
    "we study canonical single field inflation models with a polynomial potential . within this framework ,",
    "the power spectrum of the density perturbation , its spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are expressed as @xmath12 respectively , by using slow - roll parameters @xmath13 in the unit with @xmath14 . here ,",
    "a subscript @xmath2 and dot denote a derivative with respect to @xmath2 and time , respectively , and @xmath15 is the hubble parameter of the universe .",
    "the first example is the inflation driven by the potential @xmath16 for this potential , the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath17 when the inflaton reaches @xmath18 , then @xmath19 becomes unity , and inflation ends . by solving the slow - roll equation @xmath20",
    ", we obtain @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the number of @xmath23-folds during inflation , where @xmath24 is the field value when inflation ends and is dropped in eq .",
    "( [ sol : phi1 ] ) due to the smallness compared to the others .",
    "we show the contours of inflationary observables in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : positive60 ] is for the case that the observed cosmological scale @xmath26 mpc@xmath27 is assumed to correspond to @xmath28 .",
    "the double curve depicts the amplitude of the power spectrum of the density perturbation @xmath29 quoted from table 3 ( @xmath30cdm ) in ref .",
    "red lines with numbers are contours of @xmath31 .",
    "blue lines with numbers enclosed by a square are contours of @xmath9 , for which the values are those noted in eq .",
    "( [ rt : bicep ] ) . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the predicted @xmath9 without @xmath32 lies outside of the error bar reported by bicep2 .",
    "however , including a small quartic term with @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : positive50 ] is for @xmath36 and shows that @xmath37 provides the best fitting to @xmath9 .",
    "next , let us consider the case with a negative quadratic term ; in other words , this is a double - well potential .",
    "we introduce a constant term as well in order to realize the vanishing cosmological constant at the true minimum .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath38 from the stationary condition and the vanishing cosmological constant condition at the minimum , we find the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath2 and @xmath39 as @xmath40 the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath41 @xmath19 becomes unity and inflation ends when the inflaton reaches @xmath42 by solving the slow - roll equation , we obtain @xmath43 we show the contours of inflationary observables in the @xmath44 plane , with @xmath2 being the field value during inflation given in eq .",
    "( [ sol : phi2 ] ) .",
    "red lines with numbers are contours of @xmath31 with the error band reported by planck .",
    "the blue line with the number @xmath0 enclosed by a square is the central value contour of @xmath9 by bicep2 . without the @xmath45 term , in other words in the @xmath46 potential limit , the predicted @xmath31 lies outside of the uncertainty band reported by planck , as is well known  @xcite .",
    "the black thick and solid line correspond to the @xmath2 field value for @xmath28 and @xmath47 in figs .",
    "[ fig : negative60 ] and [ fig : negative50 ] , respectively . as increasing @xmath45 ,",
    "those lines approach observed values of @xmath31 as well as @xmath9 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : negative60 ] , we find that the @xmath48 contour meets the @xmath49 line at @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath51 the double - well potential with this vev well reproduces those observed values .",
    "the double curve for @xmath29 is drawn with @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative60 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : negative50 ] is for @xmath36 , where we omit the @xmath53 contour for simplicity .",
    "we need @xmath54 to realize @xmath48 for @xmath36 , which is far outside of the range in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative50 ] .",
    "we have shown that general polynomial inflation models are fit well to the observed data including the tensor - to - scalar ratio recently reported by bicep2 . in other words , after we know the size of @xmath9 , we are able to determine more parameters of inflation models .",
    "in fact , for @xmath55 with @xmath28 , we find @xmath56 and @xmath57 . a double - well potential also can be fit nicely to the data ; then , the vev should be @xmath58 , and the self - coupling constant is @xmath59 for @xmath28 .    finally , we note here possible directions of particle physics model construction for inflation .",
    "being aware of the above size of self - coupling , an inflaton s yukawa coupling @xmath60 to fermion @xmath61 , @xmath62 , should be smaller than @xmath63 because it induces a @xmath64 self - coupling by radiative corrections .",
    "supersymmetric construction of a large field inflation model has been challenging  @xcite .",
    "f - term inflation suffers from so - called `` @xmath19 problem '' due to higher - order terms from the kahler potential .",
    "imposing shift symmetry @xmath65 is one of a few effective manners to overcome the problem  @xcite .",
    "while d - term inflation has been regarded as an example of hybrid inflation  @xcite , in fact , d - term chaotic inflation is also possible  @xcite .",
    "such a model interestingly does not suffer from the @xmath19 problem even if we consider a general kahler potential because the field redefinition to the canonical field absorbs higher - order corrections and the lagrangian is reduced to a quartic or double - well potential .",
    "since a self - coupling is given by the square of a gauge coupling in the d - term , we need to introduce a new gauge interaction with the gauge coupling constant of @xmath66 .",
    "if we could realize a large vev about @xmath67 by any means , as we have shown , such a model would easily reproduce the data .",
    "we have restricted the polynomial potential ( [ potential : general ] ) in this paper .",
    "it would be important to add higher - order terms @xmath68 as well as the cubic term @xmath69 .",
    "we will study it elsewhere .",
