    "galaxy formation and evolution are complicated matters which have not yet come to a complete and coherent understanding . in the cosmological @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model , galaxies are formed by collapsing and cooling of gas .",
    "galaxies gain in mass and determine their shape and structure through clustering and merging .",
    "this model has been very successful at reproducing observations in the formation of massive galaxies at high redshift @xcite . in recent years , however , the role of secular evolution on nearby galaxies has been found to be more and more significant , compared with the violent merging and clustering in the early universe @xcite .",
    "a lot of observational evidence shows that evolutions of bulge and disk are being leaded by some secular processes , which are caused by the asymmetric gravitational potential from oval , bar , or spiral structure@xcite .    for a galaxy , a variety of processes might act during its formation and evolution , such as merging , satellite accreting , star forming , and radial migrating @xcite .",
    "the consequent long - time star formation and chemical enrichment would lead to non - homogeneous stellar population properties ( e.g. , age and metallicity ) .",

    "spectral line indices ( lick system ) are effective tracers of stellar populations for early - type galaxies @xcite . but for late - type galaxies , it is difficult to obtain reliable measurements due to low surface brightness and contaminated stellar continua by gaseous emission lines of star - forming regions . thus , many published studies focus on gradients of stellar population properties derived by the emission lines . @xcite and @xcite found h ii regions to have an average metallicity gradient of -0.05 dex kpc@xmath3 .",
    "recent deep investigations with absorption - line spectra have highlighted the presence of non - monotonic colors and stellar population gradients in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , gradients measured by different authors have large discrepancies , because it is difficult to disentangle the effects of age , metallicity , and dust extinction .",
    "multi - wavelength photometric data can help us to break this kind of degeneracy . observed stellar light is emitted by stars in galaxies and might be reprocessed by gas and dust in the surrounding interstellar medium .",

    "it is shorter in the bulge and longer in the disk , that is , the star forming in the inner part of m 101 is extinguished and that in the outskirt might be continuous . the average star formation timescale of the bulge , inner disk , and outer disk is about 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.6 gyr ( @xmath70 arcsec ) , respectively .",
    "the average timescale of some h ii regions in the outer disk may reach about 2.6 gyr .",
    "radial surface brightness and color are the most direct observational quantities to investigate the properties of stellar populations and the evolution status in nearby galaxies , but it is difficult to relieve the degeneracy effect . using synthetic spectral models and uv - to - ir panchromatic photometric seds , we have distinguished the effects of age , metallicity , and dust extinction .    the radial age profile of m 101 as shown in section [ sec6.3 ] presents a comparatively younger bulge ( see the discussion in next section ) , an older inner region of the disk with a steeper age gradient , and a younger outer disc region with a flatter gradient .",
    "two distinct disc components might be caused by differential rotations and a nonaxisymmetric self - gravitating mode of spiral arms , which make the inner disk contract and the outer region stretch @xcite .",
    "certainly , events , such as gas accretion and interacting with another galaxy , also trigger star formation in the outer disk and make the galaxy look younger @xcite .",
    "the age and dust extinction maps of m101 show that the central region is younger , more active in star formation , and more dusty . while in the surrounding regions ( @xmath71 = 20 ) ,",
    "the stellar populations are dominated by old bulge stars and relatively dust - free .",
    "these old stellar populations are similar to those of typical bulges or early - type galaxies , which are expected to be less attenuated than star - forming galaxies @xcite .    in our results , we find that m 101 has a radial tendency of the star formation time scale , which is shorter in the center and longer outside .",
    "actually , the typical timescale in the form of the exponentially declining sfh of an elliptical galaxy is about 1 gyr , those of s0 and sa@xmath7sd spiral galaxies range from 2 to 30 gyr , and the star formation rate of an irregular galaxy is constant @xcite .",
    "note that for a given stellar population , the sandage sfh gives a much shorter timescale than the normal exponential sfh .",
    "inner parts of the galaxy , such as the bulge , resemble early - type elliptical galaxies .",
    "most stars in these areas formed in the very early time , implying a short timescale .",
    "the outer disk is undergoing a continuous star formation , like late - type spiral or irregular galaxies , giving the longer timescale .",
    "compared with the assumption of a single star formation law ( i.e. , a single timescale ) overall the galaxy , a variational timescale should be more suitable for realistic galaxies . at the same time , this kind of timescale distribution might be important in future studies of stellar populations in different regions of galaxies and in simulations of the galactic evolution .",
    "there are radial metallicity gradients both in the stellar content and gas - rich h ii regions .",
    "the gradient of the stellar abundance is flatter and the gas - phase gradient is much steeper .",
    "in fact , many observations of nearby spiral galaxies show that the inner disk has higher metallicity than the outer disk and the typical gradient of h ii regions is about -0.05 dex kpc@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the gas - phase metallicity gradient of m 101 is about -0.045 dex kpc@xmath3 , which is lower than the average gradient of other sc or scd type galaxies , such as m33 , ngc 2403 , and ngc 3184 @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence showing that interacting pairs might have systematically lower metallicities than field galaxies @xcite and recent mergers also make the metallicity gradient flatten .",
    "m 101 is the main body in the m 101 group .",
    "it might be interacting with ngc 5474 and ngc 5477 in the group as suggested by @xcite , who declared , with the deep neutral hydrogen observation and deep optical images , that the group is in a dynamically active state and encounters in the group environment are building up the outer disk of m 101 . in a whole , the existence of a metallicity gradient in m 101 supports an inside - out disk growth scenario : the early gas infall or collapse made the small inner region more metal - rich and the outer disk was enriched more slowly @xcite .    from the metallicity map in figure [ fig9 ]",
    ", we also notice that the abundance in the inter - arm regions is poorer than spiral arms .",
    "it was expected by some numerical models that establish density waves to trigger star formation .",
    "@xcite suggested that some azimuthal mixing processes such as super - shell expansion are able to wipe out the abundance inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium in a few galactic rotation ( maybe about 1@xmath73 gyr ) .      at early times",
    ", the galactic evolution was leaded by a combination of dissipative collapses and mergers .",
    "the evolution timescale was short and the processes were violent @xcite . in the local universe , some internal secular processes become dominant .",
    "these secular processes tend to make late - type galaxies to be bulgeless or have pseudobulge @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used the hobby - eberly telescope to obtain high - resolution spectra of nuclear star clusters in m 101 and ngc 6946 .",
    "they found that the nucleus of m101 has an average rotation velocity of about 210 @xmath41 15 km s@xmath3 , but the velocity dispersion is only about 25 @xmath41 7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite measured the @xmath72 @xmath20 m color as a rough estimate of the specific star formation rate and reported that the bulge of m 101 is mildly active .",
    "the srsic index of the bulge is about 1.8 @xcite , which is less than 2 .",
    "the central region of m 101 is younger than the surrounding inner disk as shown in our age map , indicating that there is recent star forming in the bulge .",
    "the above characteristics , including kinematics dominated by rotation , small velocity dispersion , nearly exponential brightness profile ( @xmath73 ) , and relatively active star formation , show that the bulge of m 101 is a so - called pseudobulge , which reserves some features of the disk .",
    "the pseudobulge is believed to form via the internal secular evolution of the disk @xcite .",
    "the nonaxisymmetries of the gravitational potentials from bars , ovals , and/or spiral arms would rearrange the mass and angular momentum and cause gas infall to build up the central mass concentration . in normal spiral galaxies without bars and ovals , shocks actuated by the density wave",
    "make gas in the disk lose energy and drop into the center , which gradually forms the disk - like bulge . for barred galaxy , gravitational torques and shocks",
    "cause the gas inflow along the bar ends to trigger star formation and make young stellar populations and central mass convergence . for more information about the secular evolution and pseudobulges , refer to the review of @xcite .",
    "the co radio observations show that there is a bar - like morphology in the center of m 101 @xcite .",
    "the bar feature has a length of 1.5 @xmath41 0.5 with a position angle of 102@xmath74 .",
    "this feature is expected to appear at the inner lindblad resonances ( ilr ) .",
    "the gas in the disk is likely to steam along the molecular bar , pile up at the ilrs , and trigger star formation @xcite . from the maps of age , metallicity , dust extinction , and the optical image from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , a bar - like knot in the center can be resolved , which is relatively young , metal - rich , and dusty .",
    "in addition , the parameter discrepancies between the pseudobulge and inner parts of the disk are larger in the maps than in the radial profiles which might be smoothed by the bar feature .",
    "thus , evolutions of the pseudobulge and disk is probably ruled by some secular processes of the gas - rich bar . among late - type spirals including m 101 , the average length of bars is small , indicating a slow process of gas accretion @xcite .",
    "the star formation is also slower than early - type barred spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , such kind of secular process is less obvious in late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "radial gradients of stellar population properties have imprints of the galactic formation and evolution . colors and spectral lines",
    "are usually used to investigate the stellar population and chemical abundance of galaxies , but there are serious degeneracy effects of age , metallicity , and dust attenuation .",
    "multi - band photometric data from ultraviolet , optical , and infrared observations can help us to degrade this kind of degeneracy . by fitting with the evolutionary stellar population synthesis models , we have derived spatially resolved distributions of age , metallicity , dust extinction , and star formation timescale in a nearby scd galaxy m 101 . in our fitting method , we constrain the dust attenuation with the irx-@xmath0 relation , which is found to strongly correlate to a second parameter of birth rate @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter is related to both age and star formation history .",
    "\\1 ) the stellar disk is optically thicker in the inner region than the outer region .",
    "the overall dust extinction of m 101 is measured to be about 0.24 mag , which is a litter lower than galaxies of similar morphological type and much lower than those of earlier type .",
    "the core of this galaxy is somewhat dusty .",
    "extinctions of h ii regions from both our mmt observations and literatures also show the same radial tendency .",
    "the dust attenuation of the stellar content is much lower than that of h ii regions , and a rough linear correlation is obtained as @xmath75 .",
    "\\2 ) the stellar metallicity has a gradient of -0.011 dec kpc@xmath3 , lower than that of the gas - phase abundance gradient ( -0.045 dec kpc@xmath3 ) derived by the spectra of h ii regions from mmt observations and literatures .",
    "the metallicity gradient of m 101 is flatter than those of sc and scd type galaxies , because interactions and mergers might lower the metallicity and make it flatten , which was suggested by @xcite .",
    "actually , m 101 is located in a small group , and it might be interacting with two other members ngc 5474 and ngc 5477 as indicated in @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) two distinct regions of the stellar disk with different age and color gradients are discovered .",
    "the age gradient of the inner region is steeper and that of the outer region is flatter , which might be caused by the secular dynamical evolution of the disk .",
    "\\4 ) we highlight that a variational star formation timescale should more exactly describe a real galaxy than just a single timescale in the form of sfh .",
    "the timescale of m 101 increases gradually from the galactic center to outskirts",
    ". it should be reasonable , because the bulge in the center resembles elliptical galaxies with small typical timescales and the outer region of the disk is similar to late - type spirals with large timescales .",
    "\\5 ) the bulge of m 101 is younger , more dusty , and more metal - rich than surrounding inner disk regions , indicating that it has been forming stars recently .",
    "active star formation in this galaxy , together with other observations including high rotation velocity , low velocity dispersion , and nearly exponential brightness profile , indicates that the bulge is a so - called pseudobulge . from our age ,",
    "metallicity , and dust maps as well as gas distribution from radio observations , we find that there is a resolved bar in the center .",
    "thus , the growth of the pseudobulge and evolution of the disk are likely to be induced by some secular processes of the bar , whose gravitational potential causes the gas to fall through the bar ends , triggers star formation , and makes central mass concentration .",
