    "since the discovery of the cmb a key question has been : how does it deviate from a perfect uniform black body spectrum ?",
    "the firas ( far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ) instrument ( fixsen & mather 2002 , brodd  1997 ) has shown the spectrum is nearly an ideal black body spectrum from @xmath2  ghz to @xmath3  ghz with temperature 2.725@xmath4.001 k. at lower frequencies the spectrum is not so tightly constrained ; plausible physical processes ( reionization , particle decay ) could generate detectable distortions below 10 ghz while remaining undetectable by the firas instrument .",
    "the arcade ( absolute radiometer for cosmology , astrophysics and diffuse emission ) experiment observes the cmb spectrum at frequencies a decade below firas to search for potential distortions from a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) carries a history of energy transfer between the evolving matter and radiation fields in the early universe .",
    "energetic events in the early universe ( particle decay , star formation ) heat the diffuse matter which then cools via interactions with the background radiation , distorting the radiation spectrum away from a blackbody .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the resulting distortion depend on the magnitude and redshift of the energy transfer ( burigana  1991 , burigana  1995 ) .",
    "the primary cooling mechanism is compton scattering of hot electrons against a colder background of cmb photons , characterized by the dimensionless integral @xmath5 } { m_e c^2 }   \\sigma_t n_e(z ) c \\frac{dt}{dz^\\prime } dz^\\prime , \\label{compton_y_definition}\\ ] ] of the electron pressure @xmath6 along the line of sight , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron mass , spatial density , and temperature , @xmath10 is the photon temperature , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath12 is redshift , and @xmath13 denotes the thomson cross section ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ) . for recent energy releases @xmath14 ,",
    "the gas is optically thin , resulting in a uniform decrement @xmath15 in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum where there are too few photons , and an exponential rise in temperature in the wien region with too many photons .",
    "the magnitude of the distortion is related to the total energy transfer @xmath16 energy transfer at higher redshift @xmath17 approaches the equilibrium bose - einstein distribution , characterized by the dimensionless chemical potential @xmath18 free - free emission thermalizes the spectrum at long wavelengths . including this effect , the chemical potential becomes frequency - dependent , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transition frequency at which compton scattering of photons to higher frequencies is balanced by free - free creation of new photons .",
    "the resulting spectrum has a sharp drop in brightness temperature at centimeter wavelengths ( burigana  1991 ) .",
    "a chemical potential distortion would arise , for instance , from the late decay of heavy particles produced at much higher redshifts .",
    "free - free emission can also be an important cooling mechanism .",
    "the distortion to the present - day cmb spectrum is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dimensionless frequency @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the optical depth to free - free emission @xmath25 } { t_e(z ) } \\frac { 8 \\pi e^6 h^2 n_e^2 g } { 3 m_e ( kt_{\\gamma})^3 \\sqrt{6\\pi m_e k t_e } } \\frac{dt}{dz^\\prime } dz^\\prime , \\label{yff_definition}\\ ] ] and g is the gaunt factor ( bartlett & stebbins 1991 ) .",
    "the distorted cmb spectrum is characterized by a quadratic rise in temperature at long wavelengths .",
    "such a distortion is an expected signal of the reionization of the intergalactic medium by the first collapsed structures .     ,",
    "width=312 ]    figure [ arcade_vs_firas ] shows current upper limits to cmb spectral distortions .",
    "measurements at wavelengths shorter than 1  cm are consistent with a blackbody spectrum , limiting @xmath26 and @xmath27 at 95% confidence ( fixsen  1996 , gush  1990 ) .",
    "direct observational limits at longer wavelengths are weak .",
    "reionization is expected to produce a cosmological free - free background with amplitude of a few mk at frequency 3 ghz ( haiman & loeb 1997 , oh 1999 ) .",
    "the most precise observations ( table [ measure ] ) have uncertainties much larger than the predicted signal from reionization .",
    "existing data only constrain @xmath28 , corresponding to temperature distortions @xmath29 mk at 3 ghz ( bersanelli  1994 ) .",
    "uncertainties in previous measurements have been dominated by systematic uncertainties in the correction for emission from the atmosphere , galactic foregrounds , or warm parts of the instrument .",
    "arcade represents a long - term effort to improve measurements at cm wavelengths using a cryogenic balloon - borne instrument designed to minimize these systematic errors .",
    "this paper presents the first results from the arcade program .",
    "the arcade is a balloon - borne instrument with two radiometers at 10 and 30 ghz mounted in a liquid helium dewar .",
    "each radiometer consists of cryogenic and room temperature components .",
    "a corrugated horn antenna , a dicke switch consisting of a waveguide ferrite latching switch , an internal reference load constructed from a waveguide termination , and gaas hemt amplifier comprise the cryogenic components .",
    "the signal then passes to a 270 k section consisting of additional amplification and separation into two sub - bands followed by diode detectors , making four channels in all ( kogut  2004a ) .",
    "in addition there is an external calibrator which can be positioned to fully cover the aperture of either the 10 or 30  ghz horn ( kogut  2004b ) .",
    "helium pumps and heaters allow thermal control of the cryogenic components which are kept at 2 - 8  k during the critical observations .    to minimize instrumental systematic effects the horns",
    "are cooled to approximately the temperature of the cmb ( 2.7 k ) .",
    "the horns have a @xmath30 full - width - half - maximum beam and are pointed @xmath31 from the zenith to minimize acceptance of balloon and flight train emission .",
    "a helium cooled flare reduces contamination from ground emission .",
    "no windows are used .",
    "air is kept from the instrument by the efflux of helium gas .",
    ".[measure ] previous low frequency cmb measurements and their uncertainties from the literature .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < \" , ]     table [ fit ] shows that most of the components have a small coupling to the radiometer output .",
    "the critical components are the reference , and two of the external calibration thermometers near the tips of the external calibrators eccosorb load and near the center of the beam ( t1 and t2 ) , where most of the emission is expected to originate .",
    "the horn emissivity is 0.8% or about what is expected from an aluminum antenna of this type at this frequency .",
    "the reference load emissivity is near its ideal of -1 for the 10  ghz radiometers , giving confidence in the fit .    as can be seen from table  [ meantemps ] ,",
    "the mean temperatures of the major components of the 10  ghz radiometer are near the cmb temperature .",
    "this minimizes the effects of reflections , unmodeled emission and responsivity variations .",
    "the cold reference has as much impact on the radiometer signal as the sky or external calibrator .",
    "but the sky temperature estimation does not depend on the _ absolute _ accuracy of the reference thermometer .",
    "nevertheless the reference thermometer ( like all of the thermometers ) is read out to a precision of .15  mk and has been calibrated to 2  mk , at the lambda point , against an absolute nist standard .",
    "figure  [ residuals ] shows the residuals in the data after the model has been removed . comparing fig .",
    "[ temps ] with fig .",
    "[ residuals ] it can be seen that while the radiometer component temperatures vary by several kelvins , the residuals of the fit vary by only tens of millikelvins .",
    "the sky data is even better with only 5  mk rms residuals .",
    "while this may be surprising for a linear model which has only 13 parameters and no explicit information about the radiometer , it demonstrates that the system is close to linear and all of the major components are measured .",
    "the higher residuals during the calibration are mainly due to the high rates of temperature change in the calibrator .",
    "the 30  ghz data has higher residuals than the 10  ghz data ( fig [ residuals]b ) .",
    "there are four contributing reasons .",
    "first the 30  ghz radiometers have higher intrinsic noise which is amplified by the fitting process .",
    "second , most of the data is calibration data which has additional noise from the calibrator and does not constrain some of the parameters of the fit as well .",
    "third , the temperatures of the calibrator and the antenna are higher than for the 10  ghz data providing a poorer match to the cmb .",
    "fourth , the antenna observes a smaller section of the calibrator so gradient and changes in time are not smoothed as well as in the 10  ghz radiometer .    to estimate the sky temperature , the temperature of all of the calibrator thermometers in the fit",
    "is replaced with a test sky temperature plus foreground models for times that the radiometer observes the sky .",
    "the test sky temperature is then varied to find a minimum in @xmath32 which is interpreted as the best fit sky temperature .",
    "the variation in the @xmath33 is then used to determine the statistical uncertainty of the sky temperature .",
    "the @xmath33 is renormalized at the best fit solution , so this procedure includes some , but not all , of the systematic effects .    in the long wavelength limit",
    "the antenna temperature and the thermodynamic temperature are identical .",
    "for some of the lower temperatures in this experiment , this approximation is marginal , so the thermodynamic temperature is translated to an antenna temperature for each of the measurements and the entire fit is done with antenna temperatures .",
    "this makes a 1  mk correction to the 10  ghz result and lowers the total @xmath33 by 2.6 and 1.7 , for the two channels .",
    "the effect is larger ( 8  mk ) for the 30  ghz result with @xmath33 changes of 18 and 24 for the two channels .",
    "the results of this fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ sky ] .",
    "the final thermodynamic temperatures for the four channels are : 10  ghz narrow : @xmath34  k , 10  ghz wide : @xmath35  k , 30  ghz narrow : @xmath36  k , and 30  ghz wide : @xmath37  k , where the @xmath38 uncertainties are calculated from the change in @xmath33 .",
    "one of the principal advantages of a balloon flight is that it puts the instrument above about 99.5% of the atmosphere and a larger fraction of the water vapor .",
    "the residual atmosphere is less than 1  mk in the 10  ghz channel ( staggs , 1996a ) .",
    "this is too small to be seen in our tipping scans ; no correction is made but 1  mk uncertainty is included in the final uncertainty estimate .",
    "most of the instrument was in the far sidelobes of the horns so its thermal emission to the radiometer is negligible .",
    "however the flight train , consisting of the parachute , ladder , faa transmitter and balloon is directly above the radiometer only 30@xmath39 from the center of the beam .",
    "its emission could not be ignored .",
    "since this system is complicated and moves with the balloon rather than the gondola , a reflector attached to the gondola was constructed of aluminized foam board to hide these components and instead reflect the sky into the radiometers .",
    "the 4@xmath40  steradian antenna pattern was carefully measured in the goddard test range in the flight configuration in the flight dewar including the external calibrator .",
    "this measured pattern was convolved with the positions and emissivity estimates of the flight train and balloon to estimate the radiation from the balloon and flight train .",
    "the total expected emission does not change much because of the reflector , but it is much easier to compute and more stable .",
    "the details of this calculation are provided by kogut  ( 2004a ) .",
    "tip scans in flight provide a direct emission measurement from the instrument . after the external calibrator and sky",
    "were observed , the radiometer was tipped up to @xmath41 leading to predictable changes in the antenna temperature as the angle to the reflector changed .",
    "the predicted model was fit to the tip scan data with a single overall scale factor , with the best fit @xmath42 of the predicted signal for the 10  ghz channels .",
    "this is within the uncertainty of the emissivity assumed by the model .",
    "because of the failure in the external calibrator moving mechanism the measurement could not be repeated for the 30  ghz channel .",
    "but the rough agreement between the model and the measurement gives confidence to the estimate of 10  mk radiation from the reflector .",
    "we correct the data for 1.5@xmath43 mk@xmath44  mk and assign a @xmath45 mk@xmath46  mk uncertainty to the correction .     as a function of the test sky temperature for the 10 ghz channels .",
    "the parabola on the left is for the wide channel and the parabola on the right is for the narrow channel .",
    "both have been renormalized to a @xmath33/dof of 1 at the minimum .",
    "1 and 2  @xmath47 cutoffs are shown as dotted lines.,width=312 ]      the antennas viewed the sky at galactic latitude @xmath48 with a majority of observations at @xmath49 . the galactic foreground is estimated using models of the synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission derived from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and other data ( bennett  2003 ) .",
    "the wmap maximum entropy foreground models for each component are scaled to the center frequency of each arcade band using the spectral index derived from the wmap 23 and 33 ghz data .",
    "then the components are combined and convolved with the symmetrized arcade beam pattern to produce a smoothed map at each arcade band .",
    "the data are corrected to the mean sky temperature by including the cmb dipole as an additional `` foreground '' .",
    "higher order anisotropies in the cmb are insignificant at this level and have been ignored .    spatial structure in the foreground model",
    "is dominated by the galactic plane and the cmb dipole .",
    "this spatial variation is used as a rough check of the model and the instrument pointing .",
    "a magnetometer and redundant clinometers mounted on the dewar allow reconstruction of the pointing within 3 .",
    "the calibrated data are compared to the foreground model as the gondola rotation sweeps the beams across the sky . the calibrated data at 10 ghz is fit to a sky model that includes a scaled version of the predicted foreground plus a pointing offset .",
    "the best - fit amplitude is @xmath50 times the predicted foreground with pointing offset less than 5 .",
    "absolutely calibrated single frequency maps are unable to distinguish between the cmb and the spatially homogenous part of foreground emission . the homogenous part of each galactic foreground is estimated using template maps dominated by each component .",
    "synchrotron emission dominates the 408  mhz survey ( haslam  1981 ) .",
    "a fit to @xmath51 for @xmath52 yields",
    "a zero level @xmath53 k at the galactic poles at 408  mhz .",
    "the spectral index @xmath54 between 408  mhz and the arcade frequency bands varies across the sky and is not precisely known ; estimates typically range from -2.7 to -3.2 ( platania  1998 , bennett  2003 , finkbeiner 2003b ) . uncertainty in the synchrotron spectral index",
    "dominates the uncertainty in the foreground zero level for arcade . simply scaling the synchrotron zero level as @xmath55 with @xmath56 yields values between 0.7 and 3.5  mk at 10 ghz .",
    "bennett  present a synchrotron model which explicitly takes into account the spatial variation of the spectral index . extrapolating this model using the wmap data at 33 and 23 ghz yields a zero level of 1.4 mk at 10.1 ghz . since wmap provides high quality data at frequencies at or near the arcade data ,",
    "we adopt the wmap model for the zero level and assign uncertainty 2 mk at 10 ghz to account for the uncertainty in the spectral index .",
    "microwave free - free emission from ionized gas can be traced using h@xmath57 emission from the same gas ( finkbeiner 2003a ) .",
    "h@xmath57 emission at @xmath58 has intensity 0.5 rayleighs , corresponding to 0.04 mk at 10 ghz ( bennett  2003 ) .",
    "thermal dust emission is similarly faint , with 10 ghz antenna temperature below 1 @xmath59k at @xmath58 ( finkbeiner , davis , & schlegel 1999 ) .",
    "all galactic foregrounds are negligible ( less than 0.5  mk ) at 30 ghz .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the radiometric temperature is a combination of the uncertainties of the parts of the model that go into the radiometric temperature estimate .",
    "each of the uncertainties listed in table  [ uncertain ] will be discussed in turn .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is derived directly from the data .",
    "after the residuals are computed the @xmath33 is renormalized so that the @xmath33/dof is one .",
    "this is larger than the radiometer noise because the residuals are still contaminated by some residual systematic effects .",
    "the difference between the 10  ghz wide and 10  ghz narrow results is somewhat larger than one would expect , but the probability of getting a difference this large is 10% .",
    "we note this is not so improbable , so the two results are combined into a single average .",
    "the 30  ghz data have larger uncertainties because of the larger noise and shorter sky observation .",
    "they too are averaged .",
    "the sky temperature can not be determined to better accuracy than the absolute calibration of the thermometersin the external target .",
    "the thermometer calibration was tested several times before the flight and retested after the flight .",
    "each test reproduces the calibration to about 2  mk accuracy verified against a niststandard and cross - checked at the @xmath60 transition .",
    "the accuracy is degraded at higher temperatures , but the calibration has been shown to be stable over long periods . the uncertainty is larger for the 30  ghz because the calibrator has a higher mean temperature in the 30  ghz calibration .",
    "the uncertainty in the sky temperature is dominated by thermal gradients in the external calibrator .",
    "if the calibrator were isothermal , its only contribution to the sky temperature uncertainty would be the absolute calibration uncertainty of the embedded thermometers .",
    "spatial gradients are observed within the eccosorb absorber .",
    "the largest gradient averages 720 mk front - to - back , with the absorber tips warmer than the back .",
    "transverse gradients are smaller , with a mean gradient of 213 mk between thermometers t1 and t2 and 65  mk between t2 and t3 . these gradients are not stable in time , but vary with scatter comparable to the mean amplitude .",
    "the radiometric temperature of the external calibrator depends on the integral of the temperature distribution within the absorber , weighted by the electric field at the antenna aperture .",
    "this integral is approximated as a linear combination of the 5 thermometers imbedded in the absorber .",
    "the time variation in the temperatures and radiometer output is used to derive a single time - averaged weight for each thermometer .",
    "the procedure is insensitive to thermal gradients in directions not sampled by the thermometers , or on spatial scales smaller than the spacing between thermometers .",
    "the flight data are used to estimate these residual effects .",
    "differences between the calibrator radiometric temperature and the linearized model will appear as residuals in the calibrated data .",
    "figure 3a shows the time - ordered residuals as the 10 ghz radiometer observes both the calibrator and the sky .",
    "the residuals have standard deviation of 20 mk during calibration , compared to 5  mk during observations of the sky ( the weighted average is 6  mk ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the calibration residuals sorted with respect to the main front - to - back gradient in the calibrator .",
    "there is no correlation between the residuals and the measured temperature gradients .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured radiometric temperature of the calibrator is thus @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the standard deviation of the calibration residuals and @xmath63 is the number of independent observations . the calibration residuals are highly correlated in time , so @xmath63 is smaller than the number of data points during calibration .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty by noting that the 10 ghz calibration data shows 16 zero crossings , so that @xmath64 20 mk / @xmath65 = 5 mk at 10 ghz and @xmath64 30 mk / @xmath66 = 5 mk at 30 ghz .",
    "the linear model assumes a sufficient density of thermometers to adequately sample gradients within the absorber .",
    "this assumption is tested by dropping each thermometer in turn from the fit and repeating the analysis .",
    "additional fits derive the sky temperature after dropping two thermometers .",
    "while the @xmath33 increases for these fits ( sometimes dramatically ) , the sky temperature remains in a narrow range provided at least one of ( t1,t2 ) and at least one of ( t4,t5 ) are included in the fit .",
    "these are the thermometers needed to sense the main front - to - back temperature gradient in the calibrator .",
    "any additional thermometer is sufficient to sample the remaining ( small ) transverse gradients , demonstrating that the 5 imbedded thermometers provide adequate spatial sampling of any thermal gradients within the calibrator .",
    "the scatter in the set of solutions without one or two thermometers serves as a conservative estimate for the uncertainty from finite sampling of the temperature within the calibrator .",
    "the standard deviation of the sky temperature for these solutions is 8 mk for the 10 ghz radiometer and 30 mk for the 30 ghz radiometer ( which has a much smaller `` footprint '' of the antenna aperture on the calibrator ) .",
    "this is comparable to the uncertainty derived from the time - ordered data using a radically different approach .",
    "we conservatively adopt the larger value as our estimate for the uncertainty resulting from temperature gradients within the calibrator .      the emission from the reflector and the flight train was modeled and measured and",
    "the two agree within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the careful measurement of the beam from the mouth of the antenna allows a very complete model .",
    "the tipping tests demonstrate that model is basically correct .",
    "the major uncertainty in the model is the emissivity of the aluminum foil on the foam . by calibrating against the measurement",
    "this uncertainty is reduced .",
    "l c c l & 10 ghz & 30 ghz & + source & radiometer & radiometer & notes + statistical uncertainty & 4 mk & 7 mk & from @xmath33 + thermometer calibration & 3 mk & 4 mk & from lab tests + calibrator gradients & 8 mk & 30 mk & fits with thermometers omitted + instrument emission & 3 mk & 5 mk & 30% of model + atmosphere emission & @xmath67 mk & @xmath67 mk & signal is smaller than this + galactic emission & 2 mk & @xmath67 mk & synchrotron zero point uncertainty + total uncertainty & 10 mk & 32 mk & +   +      the atmosphere has minimal contribution at 35  km , and galactic emission at the radiometer frequencies is small out of the galactic plane .",
    "even large fractional uncertainties in these estimations are unimportant to the final measurement .",
    "since the sky data are compared directly to the external calibrator , systematic effects from the instrument are all eliminated to first order .",
    "instead the burden falls on the external calibrator .",
    "the key issues are the emissivity ( or blackness ) of the calibrator , the accuracy of the thermometers and the relationship between the temperature of the thermometers and the temperature of the emitting surfaces .",
    "the arcade external calibrator has been measured to be @xmath68% emissive at 10  ghz using the flight horn antenna .",
    "the emissivity measurement was done at 295  k but the change from 295  k to 3  k should be small because the resistance changes less than 50% from 300  k to 1  k ( hemmati 1985 ) .",
    "but the reflected radiation is almost entirely radiation from the horn which was at @xmath69  k. the residual uncertainty from this effect is 0.1  mk .",
    "the remaining issue is the relationship between the temperature of the thermometers and the temperature of the emitting surface of the external calibrator .",
    "if there were no gradients the issue would vanish , but typically the gradient is 700  mk during the time of the observations .",
    "some of these gradients are measured showing that the main gradient is from the front to the back of the external calibrator .",
    "the mean temperature of the emitting surface is modeled by a linear combination of the seven thermometers on the external calibrator .",
    "the changing temperature gradients themselves determine the fit to the combination of thermometers that best models the data .",
    "as long as the variations reflect the actual mean temperatures this is a good model .",
    "tests fitting the sky temperature after dropping individual thermometers demonstrate that the calibrator has enough thermometers to adequately sense the thermal gradients .",
