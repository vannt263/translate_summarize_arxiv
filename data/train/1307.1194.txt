    "as one kind of quantum correlation , quantum entanglement has played an important role in quantum information processing tasks ( qipt ) and is an important physical resource [ 1 ] .",
    "however , quantum entanglement is the only quantum correlation for quantum pure states and it can not generally cover all the quantumness of correlation for mixed states [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "strong evidence has shown that some qipt displayed the quantum advantage without any entanglement in the tasks [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "on the contrary , in these qipt without entanglement there could be quantum discord which is introduced to effectively distinguish the quantum from the classical correlations [ 2 - 4 ] .    quantum discord ` includes ' quantum entanglement but beyond it due to the potential presence in separable states [ 9 - 11 ] . in recent years",
    ", quantum discord attracts increasing interests in various areas including the dynamical evolution [ 11 - 15 ] , the operational interpretation [ 16 - 22 ] , the quantification [ 23 - 25 ] and so on .",
    "however , the relevant research on the roles of quantum discord played in qipt is only restricted to several limited cases such as the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) [ 6 ] and the assisted optimal state discrimination [ 26 ] and so on [ 27 - 29 ] .",
    "in particular , most of the cases show that quantum discord plays the constructive role .",
    "therefore , it is natural to raise the following questions .",
    "can we find some other qitp where it is the quantum discord instead of quantum entanglement that plays the constructive role ? does the quantum discord always play the constructive role ?    in this paper , we answer the questions by considering a non - demolition probing qipt .",
    "that is , we use a probing qubit to probe the information of a quantum state subject to some unitary evolution , but density matrix of the probed quantum state can not be changed throughout the probing process , no matter what kind of initial probing state is used .",
    "we give a sufficient and necessary condition on the hamiltonian for the successful realization of the task .",
    "we find that no matter how the task is implemented , the probed and probing systems will always stay at a classical - quantum ( sometimes classical - classical ) disentangled state [ 18 ] . in particular , by a very novel approach to revealing the hidden quantum property , we find that it is inevitable that ( one - side ) quantum discord will be produced in the probing process , even though it could vanish at some special times .",
    "this shows the constructive role of quantum discord played in the process .",
    "we also give an explicit example to demonstrate the probing .",
    "it is interesting to find , in this example , that with the increasing of the accessible information to the maximum , the ratio of the quantum discord to the total correlation will decrease monotonically to zero .",
    "this means that quantum discord prevents the effective usage of the total correlation , so it plays the negative role in this sense .",
    "thus we say that quantum discord in this qipt plays the dual roles.this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our non - demolition probing task and discuss the duel roles of quantum correlation . in sec .",
    "iii , we draw the conclusion .",
    "to begin with , we would like to first give a brief description of the probing task by a class of quantum states of qubit .",
    "suppose a quantum state of a qubit given by @xmath0where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the identity .",
    "( i ) _ now we hope to extract the information of _ @xmath4 _ _  such that the probed state has still the density matrix _ _ @xmath5 _ _  during the probing process . _ _ generally , since we have known the eigenvectors of @xmath5 , we can construct an observable @xmath6 made up of the projectors @xmath7 and directly measure the ensemble @xmath8 to reach our aim .",
    "however , for some particular purpose , it is supposed that the direct measurements on the qubit are not allowed .",
    "( ii ) _ so we require to introduce a probing qubit to interact with the probed one governed by some unitary evolution . _      with the task in mind , we will proceed by the following rigid way .",
    "* theorem 1.*-let @xmath9 be the initial state of the probing qubit and @xmath10 be the unitary operation that successfully probes @xmath5 given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , then the interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12where @xmath13 denote the pauli matrices , @xmath6 and @xmath14 are hermitian with tr@xmath15  and @xmath16 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "* the final state after the evolution of the infinitesimal @xmath17 governed by @xmath18 is given by@xmath19to the first order of @xmath20 we have @xmath21 \\right\\vert ^{2}\\]]with @xmath22 $ ] denoting the commutator .",
    "since any traceless hermitian matrix @xmath11 can be rewritten as@xmath23eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be given by @xmath24 + \\delta t\\sum\\limits_{j , k}t_{jk}\\left [ \\sigma _ { j},\\rho _ { u}\\right ] \\left (   \\text{tr}_{p}\\rho _ { p}\\sigma _ { k}\\right ) .\\]]we require that the reduced density matrix of @xmath25 is not disturbed by any probing state @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath26 , so @xmath27 = 0,\\]]which implies that , for any @xmath28 , @xmath29 in addition , substitute eq .",
    "( 5 ) into eq . ( 3 ) and trace over the probed qubit @xmath5 , we can arrive at @xmath30 -i\\delta t\\sum\\limits_{k}t_{xk}\\left [ \\sigma _ { k},\\rho _ { p}\\right ] \\left ( \\text{tr}_{u}\\rho _ { u}\\sigma _ { x}\\right ) .\\]]insert eq . ( 1 ) into eq .",
    "( 9 ) , one can find that the unknown parameter @xmath4 is only included by tr@xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to extract the information on @xmath4 , we require that @xmath32 \\neq 0.\\]]thus @xmath11 can be written as @xmath33where @xmath34is hermitian and @xmath35is traceless and hermitian . meanwhile , eq .",
    "( 10 ) is equivalent to @xmath36 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath37    * theorem 2.*-if an interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 satisfies theorem 1 , any probing process governed by @xmath11 will need no entanglement , but inevitably produce ( only one - side ) quantum discord in the infinitesimal time .    * proof.*-the final state after the infinitesimal evolution is given by eq .",
    "substitute eq .",
    "( 2 ) into eq . ( 3 ) , we have @xmath38   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\frac{1+x}{2}\\left\\vert + \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle + \\right\\vert \\otimes \\left ( \\rho _ { 1}-x\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1-x}{2}\\left\\vert -\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle -\\right\\vert \\otimes \\left ( \\rho _ { 1}+x\\right)\\end{aligned}\\]]with@xmath39 ,   \\notag \\\\ x & = & i\\delta t\\left [ a,\\rho _ { p}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\]]it is obvious that there is not any entanglement in @xmath25 .",
    "it is also easy to find that , if @xmath25 has no discord , @xmath40 = 0 $ ] .",
    "next , we will show that this is not satisfied at any rate .",
    "expand @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 in the basis of the pauli matrices , we will have eqs .",
    "( 12,13 ) for @xmath6 and @xmath14 and@xmath41let @xmath42^{t}$ ] , @xmath43^{t}$ ] and @xmath44^{t}$ ] denote vectors , one will easily check that @xmath16 = \\mathbf{a}% \\times \\mathbf{c}$ ] with \" @xmath45 denoting the outer product .",
    "thus for nonzero @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\left [ \\rho _ { p}-i\\delta t\\left [ b,\\rho _ { p}\\right ] , x\\right ]   \\notag \\\\ & = & i\\delta t\\left ( \\mathbf{c}-i\\delta t\\mathbf{b}\\times \\mathbf{c}\\right ) \\times \\left ( \\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{c}\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & = & i\\delta t\\mathbf{c}\\times \\left ( \\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{c}\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & \\neq & 0.\\end{aligned}\\]]this shows that there is always quantum discord in the process .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath37    based on the above two theorems , we show that any non - demolition probing processing will need no entanglement , but always need quantum discord within an infinitesimal evolution from the beginning . in this sense , we say that at quantum discord plays the constructive role in the probing task . of course",
    ", this does nt exclude that there could be some special time @xmath50 such that the whole system will arrive at a final state @xmath51 with no quantum discord .",
    "if so it is , one could think that if we operate a quantum gate @xmath52 on our initial state @xmath53 , we will be able to complete our task without any discord . however , in the practical scenario , it is not the case , because the operation of any quantum gate actually needs to evolve from the beginning to some expected time . for a given hamiltonian @xmath11 all the parameters but the time @xmath54",
    "are fixed , so for such a fixed 1-parameter unitary group @xmath55 the given @xmath11 is the unique possible hermitian operator based on stone s theorem [ 30 ] .",
    "therefore , there is no other forms of quantum evolution to implement the quantum gate @xmath56 .",
    "so it is inevitable to produce quantum discord in the process .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have shown the constructive role ( the necessary presence ) of the quantum discord in the coupling between the probing and the probed systems .",
    "next , we will give an evidence that the quantum discord in some probing process could play the negative role by considering the usage of amount of the information .",
    "since we need to quantitively study the various correlations in the tasks , we will consider a concrete model of our quantum probing instead of in a general way like the previous two theorems .",
    "meanwhile , this model will also give a detailed demonstration of the previous theorems .",
    "suppose that the probed quantum state is still given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the intial probing state is @xmath57 . let the interaction hamiltonian governing the unitary evolution be@xmath58where the superscript ` u ' corresponds to the probed qubit and ` p ' corresponds to the probing one .",
    "it is obvious that the current case satisfies theorem 1 and 2 , so the non - demolition probing can be successfully implemented .",
    "in addition , this hamiltonian @xmath11 given in eq . ( 18 ) can be easily realized in spin chains systems without magnetic field [ 31 ] , josephson junction [ 32 ] or the system of the interaction between cavity and atoms [ 33 ] . after the evolution , one has the final state of the joint system as@xmath59with @xmath60it is obvious that ( i ) the reduced density matrix of the probed quantum system is @xmath5 , the reduced density matrix of the probing system is @xmath61(ii ) there is nt any entanglement in @xmath62 , and ( iii )",
    "@xmath4 can be extracted , for example , measure @xmath63 on @xmath25 at any a proper @xmath64 such that @xmath65 , we will easily be able to read the value @xmath4 by @xmath66 .",
    "( i - iii ) are consistent with our previous theorems and the independence of the initial states can be found by checking that the reduced density tr@xmath67 will not be disturbed if we use any other quantum probing state .",
    "in addition , one can easily find that the geometric quantum discord @xmath68 defined in ref .",
    "[ 25 ] can be analytically given by@xmath69where @xmath70 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath71 vanishes for @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "this gives an explicit demonstration that quantum discord plays the role even though it could vanish in the evolution .",
    "why can one extract the information of the probed state by the measurement on the probing state ?",
    "the necessary condition for this is that there should exist the common information ( the mutual information or the total correlations ) between the probing and the probed systems due to their interactions .",
    "however , it is not sufficient for this task .",
    "not all the mutual information are accessible , because the quantum part of the mutual information has to be destroyed in any local measurements and the extraction of the classical part is up to the employed measurements",
    ". suppose we can always find the optimal measurements that attain the maximal accessible information , i.e. , the classical correlation defined between the probed and the probing systems .",
    "so on the one hand , the larger ratio of the classical to the total correlation ( usage rate ) will mean the better usage of the limited resource ( total correlation ) . in this sense",
    ", consider the quantum discord defined as the difference between the total and the classical correlations , the larger ratio of quantum correlation ( quantum discord ) to the total correlation naturally means the lower efficiency of the usage of the total correlation . on the other hand",
    ", the larger classical correlation will also mean the more information to be extracted .",
    "next , we will show that , with the maximal accessible information or classical correlation monotonically increasing to its maximum , the usage rate of the total correlation will also monotonically increase to one . on the contrary",
    ", the ratio of quantum discord to the total correlation will monotonically decrease to zero .",
    "so we think that the quantum discord in this case plays the negative role .",
    "it is shown that the maximal classical correlation corresponds to the zero quantum discord .",
    "the lower figure shows the ratios @xmath75 ( solid line ) and @xmath76 ( dash - dotted line ) @xmath77 @xmath74",
    ". the larger ratio of classical correlation and the larger accessible information correspond to the smaller ratio of quantum discord , which implies that quantum discord prevents the effective usage of the total correlations by comparing the two figures . ]    to do so , we employ the the information theoretic quantum discord @xmath78 and classical correlation @xmath79 [ 4 ] , respectively , defined for @xmath62 as @xmath80where@xmath81is the total correlation , @xmath82with @xmath83 the von neumann entropy , @xmath84 , @xmath85tr@xmath86 and @xmath87 the projectors on the probing qubit .",
    "lack of the analytic expressions for the quantum and classical correlations , in fig .",
    "1 we plot the total , the classical and the quantum correlations , and the ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which is consistent with our conclusion .      before the end",
    ", we would like to generalize our probing task to a general case .",
    "now , we assume the probed state defined in @xmath90dimensional hilbert space is given by@xmath91with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , are some known functions on @xmath4 and @xmath94 , and the probing state is still a qubit .",
    "the other requirements on the task are the same as those on the qubit case . based on a similar proof as theorems 1 and 2 , one",
    "will obtain the following theorem .    *",
    "theorem 3*.-theorem 1 and theorem 2 hold for @xmath5 given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) if @xmath11 given in eq . ( 2 ) is replaced by @xmath95where @xmath96 is one generator of the @xmath97 group or @xmath98 with @xmath99 real and @xmath100 being some commutation generators of @xmath97 group , and @xmath101 is the unitary transformation that changes @xmath102 to the eigenvectors set of @xmath96 .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 and @xmath14 are hermitian with tr@xmath15  and @xmath16 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "in summary , we have presented a task to probe a single - parameter quantum state . in this scheme ,",
    "the probed state is not disturbed no matter what kind of initial probing state is chosen , so it is non - demolition and independent of the choice of the initial probing state ( actually it is implied that the external noise on the probing qubit can not disturb the probed state either ) .",
    "it can be found that that there is no entanglement in the whole probing process and the whole bipartite system always stays at a classical - quantum state .",
    "it is quite interesting that it is inevitable that quantum discord will be produced for the successful probing , but the fraction of the quantum discord in the total correlation will have to reduce to zero for the maximal accessible information . in this sense",
    ", we say that quantum discord in this task plays the dual roles .",
    "in addition , the approach employed to consider the role of quantum discord could shed new light on the understanding of quantum correlation in other qipts .",
