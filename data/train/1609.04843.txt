    "in the field of analysis of weather data , greenhouse gas emission data , biological experimental data , mri scan data , it is of interest to estimate the spatiotemporal dependence structure of the response variable at different levels such as upper and lower extremes .",
    "traditional spatio - temporal mean regression may be inappropriate in this context .",
    "for example , if the response variable is highly skewed over the time , spatio - temporal mean regression does not represent typical relation .",
    "+ quantile regression was introduced in @xcite .",
    "generalizations and extensions of quantile regression were proposed from both frequentist and bayesian perspective ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a comprehensive account of various aspects of quantile regression can be found in @xcite .",
    "the above methods were proposed for single quantile level .",
    "the main drawback of separate quantile regression for different levels is that the lower quantile estimation curves may cross the upper quantile curves violating the monotonicity of the quantiles .",
    "in addition , single quantile regression does not allow for joint inference .",
    "+ methods addressing the monotonicity issue in estimating multiple quantile regression also have been proposed ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - crossing quantile regression method proposed in @xcite sequentially updates the quantile curves under the constraint that the higher estimated quantile curves stay above the the lower ones .",
    "the problem with this method and the many of the above mentioned non - crossing quantile regression methods is the estimated values of the quantile curves are dependent on the grid of quantiles where the curves are estimated which is not desiarble .",
    "+ instead of fitting the quantile curves for a fixed set of quantiles , a more informative picture emerges by estimating the entire quantile curve ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "suppose @xmath2 denote the @xmath3-th quantile @xmath4 of a response @xmath5 at @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the predictor . from theorem 1 of @xcite",
    "it follows that a linear specification @xmath8 $ ] is monotonically increasing in @xmath3 for every @xmath9 $ ] if and only if @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are some constants and @xmath13[0,1 ] \\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] are monotonically increasing in @xmath14 $ ] . a monotonic transformation of the explanatory and the response variables to unit intervals reduces to this @xmath15 where each of @xmath16 being monotonically increasing bijection from unit interval to unit interval .",
    "@xcite took transformed gaussian process prior to estimate @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while @xcite used b - spline basis for that purpose and argued the advantages of using b - spline basis over transformed gaussian process prior .",
    "+ consider the scenario where time is the explanatory variable and the values of the response variable corresponding to time - points are available for different spatial locations .",
    "the methods of estimating a single quantile regression curve has been extended to analyze spatial data ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "various methods for modeling spatially varying distribution function have been proposed in last decade ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "these methods treat the conditional distribution of the response at each spatial location as unknown quantities and are estimated from the data .",
    "+ one of the first work addressing the non - crossing issue of the spatial quantile regression was proposed in @xcite .",
    "they proposed a two - stage method and ensured monotonicity of the estimated quantile functions using bernstein polynomial basis function .",
    "@xcite assumed separate non - crossing quantile functions for each spatial location which evolves over time .",
    "spatial smoothing was performed using gaussian process priors .",
    "separate analysis for each spatial location may be sensitive to small sample sizes at individual locations . while this method allows estimation at all quantile levels , post - estimation processing step makes the quantification of uncertainty difficult . instead of estimating the quantile function for a set of grid - points ,",
    "the estimation of the entire quantile function is more informative . to avoid the small area estimation problem , instead of assuming unrelated quantile functions for each spatial locations",
    ", we assume the quantile function to be smooth over space and linear in time . for any given spatial location ,",
    "the estimated quantile function has the same form as in equation ( [ eq : single_quantile ] ) .",
    "similar to @xcite , the monotonicity constraint on the curves @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained through b - spline basis expansion with coefficients ( which is a function of spatial location ) increasing and lying in the unit interval .",
    "the coefficients of the b - spline basis expansion over @xmath17-dimensional space are modeled as the tensor product of univariate b - splines basis functions .",
    "a closed form likelihood is obtained in terms of the parameters in @xmath17 independent simplexes whose dimensions depend of the degree of the used b - spline basis functions . unlike the methods proposed in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the main advantage of this method is that once we estimate the parameters of the model , estimated response variable can be found for any spatial location , time and quantiles without further kriging or interpolation , and hence allows proper uncertainty quantification within the bayesian paradigm .",
    "most importantly , the approach incorporates small area estimation issues automatically in its modeling approach .",
    "ozone can be naturally found in the troposphere and other parts of the atmosphere . while , more ozone concentration at the stratosphere is desirable as it helps absorb the ultra - violet radiation , higher ozone concentration level at the troposphere is harmful for living beings . ozone occurs naturally in the troposphere in low concentration .",
    "there are mainly two sources of tropospheric ozone . a significant amount of ozone is released by plants and soil .",
    "other than that , sometimes ozone migrates down to the troposphere from the stratosphere . however , the extent of ground - level naturally occurring ozone concentration is not considered a threat to living beings and the environment .",
    "+ on the other hand , ozone is a byproduct of many human activities .",
    "increasing automobiles and industries are the main source the `` bad '' ozone in the ground - level . as mentioned in an online article , current ground - level ozone concentration has doubled since 1900 .",
    "although no single source emits ozone directly , it is generated when the hydrocarbons and nitrogen - oxides , emitted by automobiles , fuel power plants and other industrial machineries , interact with each other in the presence of sunlight , specifically the ultra - violet ( uv ) ray .",
    "in general , ozone level reaches its highest level during the summer season .",
    "typically , in the span of a day , ozone level reaches its highest level during mid and late afternoon .",

    "exposure to higher level of ozone might cause respiratory problems . in plants",
    ", it slows down growth and photosynthesis and damages internal cells .",
    "high ground - level ozone also damages textile dyes , rubbers and fibers and a few genre of paints .",
    "+ because of its unstable nature , there is no existing way to move the tropospheric ozone to the stratosphere which can be thought as the ideal way to deal with this environmental hazard . under clean air act , us environment protection agency ( epa )",
