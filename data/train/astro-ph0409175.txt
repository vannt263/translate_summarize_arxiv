    "the peculiar velocity of the earth relative to the hubble flow causes a direction aberration and a doppler shift of light that would be received by a coincident observer moving with the hubble flow .",
    "given the current precise estimate of the earth s peculiar velocity from cmb dipole measurement , @xmath1 @xcite , the maximum angular error is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is enough to cause concern for example in topological searches @xcite , weak lensing and non - gaussianity analysis @xcite based on future cmb measurements .",
    "the impact of aberration on the cmb power spectrum is much less significant @xcite .",
    "moreover , in analysis using object surveys , such as topological searches and matter distribution analysis , the aberration is already important since object positions are available to high accuracy . in the following , the term _ aberration _ shall include the doppler effect due to the peculiar motion of the earth relative to the hubble flow , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "we shall summarize how to make these corrections , and present a new deaberrated table of objects with @xmath3 .",
    "to deal with aberration , for example in the case of the _ circle test _ for evidence of cosmic topology @xcite , modifications have been proposed to these tests @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , however , is to construct the view for an observer moving with the hubble flow observer once , before applying any tests .",
    "any further analysis can proceed as before unaltered , without the trouble of deriving and verifying modified tests that may require considerably increased computer time .",
    "this deaberration can be achieved by calculating the view of an observer moving with velocity @xmath4 relative to the earth , where @xmath5 is the peculiar velocity of the earth relative to the hubble flow .",
    "in other words , we aberrate our earth view with a velocity @xmath4 .",
    "this scheme is illustrated in figure  [ fig : picture ] .    a light ray , viewed along the line of sight @xmath6 with a direction 3-vector @xmath7 , is aberrated by velocity @xmath5 as follows , @xcite : @xmath8\\hat{\\beta } }                 { \\gamma(1+\\vec{\\beta}.\\hat{n } ) } \\quad , \\quad \\gamma = ( 1-\\beta^2)^{-1 } \\quad , \\ ] ] where the primed co - ordinate system refers to the aberrated ( earth ) viewpoint . a uniform black - body temperature field , @xmath9 , aberrates @xcite into a blackbody temperature field @xmath10 according to @xmath11 to aberrate a general temperature field @xmath12 we substitute @xmath9 with @xmath12 , since light viewed along @xmath13 in the aberrated view is viewed along @xmath6 in the unaberrated view , where @xmath14 are related by equation ( [ eq : vecs ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 consequently , by aberrating with velocity @xmath4 the equation for the deaberrated temperature field is obtained : @xmath16 where @xmath13 is a function of @xmath6 given by equation ( [ eq : vecs ] ) . note that as a consistency check , equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) can be substituted in the righthandside of equation ( [ eq : t2 ] ) to give @xmath17 $ ] , which simplifies to @xmath18 using equation ( [ eq : vecs ] ) .",
    "given a pixelised map equation ( [ eq : t2 ] ) can be used to construct a deabearrated map provided a way is found to interpolate between pixels .",
    "it is reasonable to do this because of the spread beam profile of the observing instrument ensures the map is nearly bandlimited .",
    "the interpolation could be achieved using a spherical harmonic analysis of the map , @xmath19 , calculated for instance using healpix , @xcite .",
    "such interpolation does not account for the incomplete sky coverage however .",
    "localised interpolation could be achieved for example by using bicubic interpolation , but some uncertainty would remain",
    ".    it would be better to construct the deaberrated map directly from the raw time - ordered data produced by the observing instrument .",
    "pixelization occurs at the end of this process and so the need to interpolate is eliminated .",
    "typically cmb instruments produce output from several spectral channels , from which temperature is calculated , see the wmap experiment for example @xcite .",
    "the direction @xmath13 of a raw observation should be modified to its deaberrated direction @xmath6 .",
    "this is achieved by aberrating @xmath13 with velocity @xmath4 so that equation ( [ eq : vecs ] ) transforms to @xmath20\\hat{\\beta } }                 { \\gamma(1-\\vec{\\beta}.\\hat{n } ' ) } \\quad .",
    "\\label{eq : n}\\ ] ] the deaberrated temperature , using equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) , is @xmath21 the deaberrated data can then be used to construct a pixelized map in the same way a map would be constructed without deaberration .",
    "in the case of objects we first wish to know the deaberrated line of sight object direction @xmath6 from the observed aberrated object direction @xmath13 . this",
    "has already been given in equation ( [ eq : n ] ) .",
    "the doppler effect when aberrating line of sight @xmath6 is @xcite @xmath22 the deaberrated frequency , in terms of the observed @xmath13 , is then @xmath23 and the desired deaberrated spectral redshift is @xmath24 -1 = ( z'+1 ) / [ \\gamma(1-\\vec{\\beta}.\\hat{n } ' ) ] -1 \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the unredshifted spectral line frequency .",
    "+ the aberration of the photon number density spectrum from @xcite is @xmath26 so the intensity spectrum @xmath27 aberrates to @xmath28 hence the deaberrated spectrums are @xmath29 ^ 2 \\\\ i(\\nu,\\hat{n } ) & = & i'(v',\\hat{n } ' ) / [ \\gamma(1+\\vec{\\beta}.\\hat{n})]^3 \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is given by equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) and @xmath13 by equation ( [ eq : vecs ] ) .    using these formulae ,",
    "we have prepared a table of deaberrated objects from an initial table of all objects with @xmath0 taken from nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "our deaberrated table can be found at www.nd.edu/\\(\\sim\\)dmenzies/deab . for illustration , table  [ tab1 ]",
    "summarizes the 50 objects with the largest angular aberration correction ( but low redshift correction ) .",
    "for greater accuracy we must account for the variation in peculiar velocity caused by the earth s rotation and movement about the sun , which is @xmath31 of the total . to do this either the original observation must have been corrected for this variation , or we must know the time when the observation was taken and add to the average value of @xmath5 the velocity of the earth relative to the sun at this time",
    "formulae have been given for constructing deaberrated cmb maps and object surveys .",
    "it is suggested these could be applied one time prior to an application of tests that require a viewpoint that is at rest relative to the comoving hubble flow . otherwise each process must be modified and will suffer an increase in complexity and computational cost .",
    "processes currently of interest are searches for non - trivial compact topology , and in the future tests of non - gaussianity , and analysis of weak lensing .",
    "other tests will also undoubtedly come as the precision of cosmological data increases .",
