    "the decay - energy spectrum for the breakup of @xmath0c on a pb target was first reported in ref .",
    "the data were recently analyzed by cdcc ( continuum discretized coupled - channels ) calculations @xcite , and it was demonstrated that the measured spectrum is consistent with measurements of the radiative neutron capture rate on @xmath1c @xcite .",
    "the final results of the coulomb dissociation experiment have now been published @xcite .",
    "they include the decay - energy spectrum for all events and a spectrum for events at forward angles .",
    "it is of interest to investigate whether the two spectra obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be reproduced by a single , consistent theoretical description , because the forward angle measurement is primarily due to coulomb dissociation , whereas events at large scattering angles are influenced by nuclear processes .",
    "a more general issue is whether the cross section for the radiative neutron capture on @xmath1c that can be deduced from the coulomb dissociation experiment is consistent with the direct capture measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method that will be used to analyze the decay - energy spectra of @xmath0c is the semiclassical , dynamical description , where the relative motion of the projectile and target follows a classical coulomb trajectory .",
    "the breakup reaction , @xmath0c@xmath3c+n , is calculated quantum mechanically by solving the time - dependent schr \" odinger equation for the relative motion of the valence nucleon and the core fragment , in the time - dependent coulomb and nuclear fields of the target nucleus .",
    "the semiclassical model used here was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a three - dimensional generalization of a previous two - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "it has been applied in studies of the coulomb dissociation of @xmath4b @xcite and @xmath5f@xcite nuclei , and it has provided a qualitative understanding of some of the phenomena that can occur .",
    "for example , intermediate energy coulomb dissociation experiments are commonly analyzed in first - order perturbation theory in terms of e1 transitions using the so - called far - field approximation and straight line trajectories @xcite .",
    "these approximations are rather poor for the coulomb disassociation of weakly bound proton+core systems , partly because the far - field approximation breaks down and partly because e2 transitions and higher - order processes can not be ignored @xcite . as a consequence , a discrepancy of 15% was observed between the measured radiative capture rate of protons on @xmath6be and the rate inferred from coulomb dissociation experiments @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy was later resolved by cdcc calculations @xcite that included the effects discussed above , in addition to the nuclear induced breakup of @xmath4b .",
    "it is surprising that the discrepancy between the direct measurement of the cross section for the radiative neutron capture on @xmath1c @xcite and the first - order analysis of the @xmath0c coulomb dissociation experiment @xcite is also of the order of 15% .",
    "naively , one would expect that the analysis of the measured decay - energy spectra in terms of first - order perturbation theory @xcite would result in a much better agreement with the direct capture measurement because the far - field approximation for coulomb excitation is well justified and the e2 strength is very weak for a neutron halo nucleus .",
    "consequently , the dynamic polarization effect , which is caused by an interplay of e1 and e2 transitions @xcite , is much weaker for a neutron than for a proton halo nucleus .",
    "it is therefore of interest to analyze the measured decay - energy within the semiclassical , dynamical description , in order to see whether the discrepancy with the radiative capture measurement can be reduced .",
    "part of the explanation for the 15% discrepancy is that the measured neutron capture rate , in addition to the direct capture to the @xmath7 ground state of @xmath0c , also includes a small branch to the @xmath8 excited state , whereas the coulomb dissociation experiment can only provide information about the capture to the ground state .",
    "unfortunately , the cross sections for the capture to the ground state and the excited state have not been measured separately .",
    "in this work the contribution from the @xmath8 branch is estimated to be of the order of 4% , so the issue is what causes the remaining 11% discrepancy .",
    "details of the structure input and some results of first - order perturbation theory are presented in the next section .",

    "the e2 response has a shoulder between 3 and 4 mev which is a consequence of the 3/2@xmath2 resonance .",
    "the e2 response does not play any practical role in the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0c because the e2 excitation probability is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the e1 excitation probability .",

    "the scaling factors obtained in the two analyses are therefore approximately identical and the @xmath58 is also very reasonable for both acceptance angles .",

    "having achieved a comprehensive description of the measured decay - energy spectra , the structure model was applied to calculate the cross sections for the radiative neutron capture on @xmath1c , not only to the ground state but also to an excited state of @xmath0c .",
    "the total capture cross section predicted by the model is ( accidentally ) in perfect agreement with the recently measured , low - energy capture cross section , and it also accounts for the neutron capture data at higher energies .",
    "that implies that the measured decay - energy spectra and the measured neutron capture cross sections are consistent within a few percent , when the decay - energy spectra are analyzed in semiclassical , dynamical description .",
    "good agreement between the dissociation and neutron capture measurements was also recently achieved within the cdcc description @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the dissociation data was based on structure models that are slightly different from the model used here , in particular with respect to d - waves .",
    "a comparison of the semiclassical and cdcc calculations will be made in the near future @xcite .",
