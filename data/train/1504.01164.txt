    "we now consider the kg @xcite equation @xmath186 which was initially proposed as a relativistic extension of the schrdinger equation .",
    "if we write the sf under the form @xmath187 and introduce the quadricurrent @xmath188 , we obtain the continuity equation @xmath189 .",
    "the quadricurrent can be written as @xmath190 with @xmath191 @xmath192 if we introduce the kg density @xmath193 , we can write the continuity equation as @xmath194 this equation shows that the integral of the kg density @xmath195 is conserved .",
    "however , the kg density @xmath196 is _ not _ definite positive so it can not be interpreted as a density probability .",
    "another difficulty with the kg equation is that it allows negative kinetic energies as solution . indeed , decomposing eq .",
    "( [ c7 ] ) into plane waves , we obtain two solutions of the form @xmath197 with @xmath198 .    the original difficulties encountered with the kg equation had interesting historical developments .",
    "dirac @xcite proposed another relativistic extension of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dirac equation describes spin-@xmath199 massive particles ( fermions ) such as electrons and quarks . in dirac",
    "s theory , the probability density is positive but negative energies are allowed .",
    "dirac solved the problem of negative energies via the `` hole '' theory @xcite .",
    "this leads to the concept of antiparticles that are related to negative energy eigenstates .",
    "antimatter was unsuspected before dirac s work .",
    "the first antiparticle , the positron , was experimentally discovered by anderson @xcite in 1932 . on the other hand , pauli and weisskopf @xcite proposed a new interpretation of the kg equation .",
    "they interpreted the kg density @xmath193 as a charge density which can be of arbitrary sign .",
    "if we define the charge density and the charge current by @xmath200 and @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is an elementary charge , we can rewrite the continuity equation ( [ c10 ] ) as @xmath203 this equation expresses the conservation of the total charge @xmath204 .",
    "although the kg equation is not a successful relativistic generalization of the schrdinger equation ( initially introduced to describe the energy spectrum of the electron ) , this equation was resurrected in the context of quantum field theory where it was shown to describe spin-@xmath2 particles ( bosons ) such as @xmath205-mesons , pions , or the higgs boson . in this interpretation , since @xmath206 , @xmath207 specifies particles with charge @xmath208 and energy @xmath209 while @xmath210 specifies antiparticles with the same mass but with charge @xmath211 and energy @xmath212 . for a real sf",
    "the charge is zero since @xmath213 and @xmath214 according to eqs .",
    "( [ c8 ] ) and ( [ c9 ] ) .    in the hydrodynamic representation of the kg equation",
    ", we write @xmath215 and define the density @xmath10 and the velocity @xmath182 by @xmath216 these variables satisfy the continuity equation @xmath217 the density @xmath218 is positive by definition but it is not conserved .",
    "therefore , @xmath218 can not be interpreted as a density probability . however , the continuity equation ( [ c14 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath219 where we have defined @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "this equation implies the conservation of the integral @xmath222 . to show that this integral corresponds to the total charge of the sf",
    ", we note that @xmath223 and @xmath224 . therefore ,",
    "@xmath225 @xmath226 these relations first establish the equivalence between eqs .",
    "( [ c11 ] ) , ( [ c14 ] ) , and ( [ c15 ] ) . furthermore , they show that the total charge of the sf can be written as @xmath227 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ c15 ] ) .",
    "( [ c18 ] ) is consistent with the expression ( [ b6 ] ) of the charge of a spatially homogeneous sf in an expanding universe ."
