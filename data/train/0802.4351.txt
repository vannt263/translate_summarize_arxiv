    "during the last decade , many efforts have been devoted to the investigation of pre - main sequence ( pms ) objects in star - forming regions and young clusters ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with the aim of studying the star formation process down to the very low - mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "unlike field stars and sub - stellar objects of the solar neighborhood , young populations in star forming regions and young clusters allow the interpretation of their observational quantities free from caveats of evolutionary or dynamical biases , because their properties are better constrained .",
    "the wealth of data collected so far indicates that stars and brown dwarfs ( bds ) share a common formation history .",
    "indeed , the detection of disks around bds @xcite , the similarity of the disk fractions of stars and bds @xcite and the continuity of accretion rates from stars to bds @xcite , suggest a stellar - like formation process , down to the deuterium burning limit @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have pointed out , however , that the fraction of young bds relative to low - mass and more massive pms stars may vary significantly among different star forming regions @xcite . in particular , the fraction in ob associations @xcite exceeds that determined for t associations @xcite , suggesting that the environment may have an important impact on the bd formation process .",
    "the spitzer space telescope offers the opportunity for a major advance in the study of star and bd formation , overcoming the problems that generally affect the observational approaches to this subject ( i.e. photometric and spatial incompleteness , incomplete data across the wavelength ranges of interest , etc ) .",
    "the spitzer legacy survey _ from molecular cores to planet forming disks _ ( c2d ) has been completely devoted to studying the process of star and planet formation from the earliest stages of molecular cores to the epoch of planet - forming disks @xcite . in the context of the c2d survey ,",
    "five large molecular clouds have been selected for mapping , with the criterion of encompassing all modes of star formation .",
    "the chamaeleon  ii ( cha  ii ) dark cloud , at a distance of 178  pc @xcite , has been chosen as a test - case of a region with low extinction and modest star - formation activity , whose young stars are isolated or in sparse groups . cha  ii has been mapped with the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ? * ) and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in addition , complementary optical imaging data have been obtained with the wide - field imager ( wfi ) at the eso 2.2 m telescope @xcite and a deep near - ir survey of the cloud was performed by @xcite .",
    "the results of these combined observations have been reported in the synthesis work by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  i ) , which provides a reliable census of the young population in cha  ii , down to 0.03  m@xmath4 , and investigates the ir properties and circumstellar disks of the young population through the comparison of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and colors with recent passive and accretion disk models for young stellar and sub - stellar objects . by merging the c2d data with the collection of data from optical to millimeter wavelengths available in the literature , paper  i also presents an overview on the global properties of cha  ii , such as clustering , extinction , cloud mass , star formation efficiency , star formation rate , etc .",
    "the main goal of the present paper , is the characterization of the young population in cha  ii by the determination of the physical parameters of the cloud members . to this aim ,",
    "we present optical spectroscopic follow - up observations of the objects selected in paper  i. the optical spectroscopy allows us to confirm the young nature of the pms objects and candidates reported in paper  i , as well as to improve the spectral type classification of the previously known members of the cloud . once the membership is established , we determine the effective temperature and luminosity for all the cloud members and hence , their masses and ages by comparison with theoretical pms evolutionary tracks .",
    "this procedure allows us to investigate the star formation history in cha  ii and estimate the imf of the region .",
    "we also discuss the stellar properties and spectroscopic features and their link with the disk properties determined in paper  i. this work is thus intended to be a complementary companion paper to paper  i.    throughout this paper we will adopt the same terminology of pms and young stellar objects ( ysos ) as presented in paper  i ; i.e. we define ysos to be those pms objects with detectable ir excess in at least one of the spitzer bands , that satisfy the c2d multi - color selection criteria described in @xcite , whereas the more general term `` pms object '' refers to young objects , not yet on the main sequence , that may or may not possess ir excess and which may have been discovered in h@xmath3 or x - ray surveys . in this sense ,",
    "all ysos are pms objects , but not vice versa .    in   [ sample ] we describe the sample of pms objects and candidates investigated in this work and present an overview of the spectroscopic observations and data reduction .",
    "the results of the follow - up spectroscopy are reported in   [ results ] and   [ par ] , where we also describe the procedures adopted for the spectral type classification and the determination of their physical parameters . in   [ substellar_objs ]",
    "we focus on the sub - stellar members of cha  ii , while in   [ sf ] we report the overall results on the imf and the star formation history in the cloud . finally , in   [ star_disk ] and   [ ha_accr_ind ] we discuss possible correlations between spectroscopic diagnostics , stellar parameters , and disk properties .",
    "we summarize our results in   [ sum ] .",
    "the sample studied in this work consists of the 62 pms objects and candidates reported in paper  i. several of these objects were proposed as potential members of cha  ii in previous works @xcite based on their strong ir excess emission , h@xmath3 emission or x - ray emission , but for many of them the confirmation of the lithium @xmath56707.8     absorption line in their optical spectra was missing .",
    "the presence of strong absorption in the lii resonance line represents in fact the most important criterion for the identification of low - mass pms stars , since lithium is efficiently destroyed by convective mixing in the stellar interior when the temperature at the bottom of the convective layer reaches about 2@xmath610@xmath7  k @xcite .    likewise , the candidates selected in the surveys by @xcite and @xcite and those resulting from the c2d selection criteria in paper  i , as well as the sub - stellar objects reported by @xcite and @xcite are included . table  [ pms_objects_a ] reports the studied sample . for the sake of homogeneity",
    "the table is presented in the same format as in paper  i and , for completeness , we also include the entry of the outflow hh  54 , as well as the three class  i objects discussed in paper  i. as will be discussed in   [ results ] , the 11 objects marked as ` cnd ' in table  [ pms_objects_a ] , and referred as ` candidates ' in the text , could not be observed in our spectroscopic survey . hence , their pms nature remains still uncertain .",
    "the two main goals of the spectroscopic observations were the detection of the lii @xmath56708 absorption line , a classical youth indicator in late - type stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the spectral type classification .",
    "to these aims , multi - object spectroscopy was performed with flames @xcite at the eso vlt - ut2 during two observing runs in visiting mode .",
    "the first run was in february 2006 , while the second one in february 2007 .",
    "the weather during both runs was photometric under sub - arcsecond seeing conditions .",
    "we used both the spectrographs fed by flames , i.e. giraffe ( in the medusa configuration ) and uves .",
    "giraffe - medusa allows the simultaneous observation of about 100 targets with intermediate resolution ( about 8,600 ) in the spectral range 64407180 , while uves can access only up to 8 objects at the time and provides a resolving power of about 48,000 in the spectral range 48006850  .",
    "such resolving powers and spectral coverages are ideal to resolve the lii line from the nearby cai @xmath56718 line , measure li equivalent widths with an error of less than 20 m   on spectra with a s / n ratio higher than 20 , and perform a reliable spectral type classification .",
    "figure  [ flames_fields ] shows the spatial distribution of the flames fields and table  [ jour_obs ] reports the journal of observations .    despite the relatively large circular field of view of flames , with approximately 25  arc - min in diameter , it was not possible to assign a large number of fibers in each configuration to the pms objects and candidates because of the rather scattered distribution of the objects throughout the entire cha  ii region ( see figure  [ flames_fields ] ) ; on average it was possible to assign only some 5 - 7 fibers to the main targets per configuration and in some cases even only 1 or 2 .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to observe several fields in order to cover as many pms objects and candidates as possible .",
    "the rest of the fibers in each configuration were assigned to a few other proposed candidates ( see next section ) , but most were randomly assigned to field stars . although these latter observations are not complete in flux , they allowed to have a check sample and , at the same time , to search for possible class  iii objects , i.e. objects with no prominent infrared excess emission , that might have escaped detection in previous surveys . in this sense ,",
    "our multi - object spectroscopic observations can be considered as an `` unbiased '' lithium survey .",
    "the number of fibers assigned to the pms objects and candidates and to the field stars are reported in table  [ jour_obs ] .",
    "note that the magnitude limit of the much higher resolution flames / uves set - up for a s / n@xmath810 is @xmath914  mag ; uves fibers were then assigned to the brightest pms objects and candidates in our sample .",
    "the typical exposure time per configuration was 3000  sec and , during the first run , several fields were observed twice or more in order to clean cosmic rays and increase the s / n of the spectra , which is always better than @xmath1020 ( see table  [ pms_objects_a ] ) .    bias , dark , flat - field and wavelength calibration lamp templates were acquired daily under the flames standard calibration plan @xcite .",
    "the data reduction , which includes the removal of instrumental signatures ( i.e. pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , determination of relative fiber - to - fiber transmission , fiber localization , fiber spatial psf modeling , etc ) and the wavelength calibration , was performed with the on - line flames pipeline @xcite , whose products are quite sufficient for our goals .",
    "additional steps for the extraction of the one - dimensional spectra and sky - spectrum subtraction were performed using the _ apall _ package under iraf .",
    "the resulting spectra were not calibrated in flux . finally , each one - dimensional spectrum was normalized to the continuum by a low - order polynomial fit on the regions of the spectrum free of absorption lines .",
    "the sampling of the data is 0.2   / pix for giraffe - medusa spectra and 0.02   / pix for uves spectra .",
    "in total , 41 out the 62 pms objects and candidates reported in paper  i were observed with flames ( 30 with giraffe - medusa and 11 with uves ) , all of which show the lii line in absorption .",
    "most also display h@xmath3 in emission .",
    "the 41 objects are flagged in table  [ pms_objects_a ] according to their observation .",
    "fourteen of these objects have been confirmed as cha  ii members for the first time , while lii has been detected for the first time in many of the previously known members ( e.g. the h@xmath3 objects by * ? ? ? * and several other iras sources ) . among the 21 pms objects and candidates not observed with flames ,",
    "10 were known to have signatures of genuine pms objects or they have been spectroscopically confirmed as members in previous works .",
    "we now briefly discuss these objects : i ) three are the class  i sources iras  12500 - 7658 , iso - chaii28 , and iras13036 - 7644 ( bhr  86 ) discussed in paper  i. the former is too faint for flames spectroscopy and the latter two are not visible in the optical ; ii ) another three , namely sstc2d  j125758.7 - 770120 , sstc2d  j130540.8 - 773958 , and iso - chaii13 are sub - stellar objects , which are also too faint to be observed with flames .",
    "these objects were spectroscopically confirmed as cha  ii members by @xcite and @xcite on the basis of their very late - type spectrum coupled with strong ir excess and signatures of a high level of activity ; iii ) the other four stars are sz48ne , sz49 , sz60e , hn22 .",
    "the former three have been spectroscopically confirmed as members of cha  ii by @xcite using the same criteria as for our observations , i.e. lii line in absorption and late - type spectra , while hn22 has been detected as a strong h@xmath3 emitter by @xcite .",
    "the sed of these 10 objects is typical of pms stars with ir excess emission .    in conclusion ,",
    "our sample of cha  ii members includes all objects for which the lii line has been observed in absorption , either in our follow - up spectroscopy or in previous studies , and those objects whose young nature is doubtless from their strong ir excess or spectral signatures of high level of activity .",
    "we consider as candidates those objects which already passed optical or c2d selection criteria based on the inspection of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , but still lack spectroscopy to definitively assess their youth .",
    "we then confirm that 51 out of the 62 objects reported in paper  i are definitely cha  ii members , while spectroscopy is still needed for the 11 remaining objects .",
    "note that three of them already passed the c2d selection criteria ( see table  7 of paper  i ) .",
    "the 51 confirmed members and the 11 candidates are flagged in table  [ pms_objects_a ] with `` pms '' and `` cnd '' , respectively .",
    "table  [ pms_objects_a ] reports also the h@xmath3 ( ew@xmath11 ) and lii ( ew@xmath12 ) equivalent widths of the confirmed pms objects , which were measured in the background - subtracted and continuum - normalized spectra using a gaussian fitting of the line profile .",
    "the continuum was defined by fitting a low order spline to a pre - selected spectral region between the h@xmath3 and lii lines . for this purpose",
    "we used the @xmath1020   continuum window between 6680 and 6700 , which is not affected by strong lines in k / m type objects .",
    "our ew@xmath12 measurements agree within 0.15   with those reported by @xcite for the previously known cha  ii members .",
    "note that such rms difference is mainly dominated by the ew@xmath12 errors resulting from the @xcite low - resolution spectra , which are on the order of 0.1 - 0.15 .",
    "note also that the ew@xmath12 values of the confirmed pms objects are typical of low - mass pms stars in other star - forming regions ( 0.3 - 0.8 ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "though the strength of the lii line and the relative uncertainty are expected to vary with spectral type , the ew@xmath12 values in our sample are stronger than those measured for pleiades stars of the same spectral type .",
    "this criterion is widely used to single out bona - fide low - mass pms stars @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ spectra ] examples of flames spectra of 20 objects selected as pms candidates are shown ; among them we show the 14 members confirmed for the first time .",
    "the strong lii @xmath136708     absorption is clearly visible , with most of them displaying h@xmath3 in emission . among the 20 spectra",
    ", we also show six lacking the lii line ; these are 2mass  12560549 - 7654106 , 2mass  13102531 - 7729085 , wfi  j12591881 - 7704419 , wfi  j12592348 - 7726589 , wfi  j13014752 - 7631023 , and wfi  j13071960 - 7655476 .",
    "the former two were proposed as member candidates by @xcite but both were rejected on the basis of the optical criteria by @xcite ; note that these two objects show h@xmath3 in absorption .",
    "the latter four were selected by @xcite with two of them displaying h@xmath3 emission , all this in agreement with the h@xmath3 photometric index for these objects reported by @xcite . because of the definitive lack of lii absorption , these six sources are not pms objects and are thus unrelated to cha  ii .",
    "note that about 50% of the candidates reported by @xcite in their table  6 are spectroscopically confirmed to be cha  ii members , in line with their conclusions .",
    "several of the spectroscopically confirmed pms objects show the he  i @xmath136678     line in emission .",
    "this line is the singlet counterpart of the he  i @xmath135876     and indicates strong chromospheric activity , consistent with the young age of these objects .",
    "moreover , the different h@xmath3 emission line profiles , typical of pms stars , can be appreciated .",
    "for instance , both iras  f12571 - 7657 and sstc2d  j130521.7 - 773810 show strong h@xmath3 emission and may well be cases of veiled objects",
    ". moreover , the spectrum of sstc2d  j130521.7 - 773810 exhibits the [ nii ] and [ sii ] forbidden emission lines at @xmath136584 and @xmath136731 .",
    "as shown in paper i ( figure  7 ) , these two objects show substantial ir excess in their seds .",
    "the presence of strong lii absorption and the weak h@xmath3 emission in the spectrum of iso - chaii29 allow us to classify this object as a weak - line t tauri star .",
    "this , together with its peculiar spectral energy distribution , which rises beyond 24  @xmath14 m ( see paper  i ) , confirms iso - chaii29 as a `` transition '' object .",
    "several other objects , proposed as possible members in previous works @xcite , were also observed , but not confirmed as members ( see table  [ tab : rej ] ) .",
    "for instance , iso - chaii73 , iso - chaii110 , iso - chaii32 , iso - chaii91 , already rejected by the @xcite optical criteria , have neither lii nor h@xmath3 emission in their spectra .",
    "the spectra of these objects are typical of k - m giants unrelated to cha  ii ( cf .",
    "figure  [ rejected ] ) . for our purposes ,",
    "this type of objects are then counted as field stars in table  [ jour_obs ] .     and lii spectral regions , respectively .",

    "[ rejected ] - continued    the fraction of class  ii to class  iii objects in chaii is the largest in the whole c2d cloud sample . unlike other t associations , the pms population in cha",
    "ii appears dominated by class  ii sources ( @xmath1060% ) , which outnumber class  iii sources by a factor @xmath102 ( see table  1 of paper  i ) .",
    "an important result of our flames observations is that no new class  iii pms objects were found among the @xmath102000 field stars observed .",
    "all these stars lack detectable lii or h@xmath15 emission in their spectra . by using the catalog of optical sources in the cha  ii direction by @xcite",
    ", we estimate that these @xmath102000 stars represent @xmath1030% of the total field stars with @xmath1617.5 in the area covered by our flames observations . therefore ,",
    "unless all the class  iii sources are located behind the cloud , which is very unlikely , this result supports the completeness of the sample of pms objects and candidates reported in paper  i.",
    "with the sample of certified pms objects and candidates , we can proceed to their characterization . in this section",
    "we outline the procedures used to determine the physical parameters .",
    "a spectral type was assigned to each observed pms star in cha  ii by using a variation of the rotfit code developed by @xcite under the idl environment .",
    "the general idea of the method is to recover the spectral type of an object by comparing its spectrum with a grid of templates with similar resolution . to this aim ,",
    "the intermediate - resolution standard templates provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as well as the high - resolution standard libraries from @xcite and @xcite were used to perform the spectral type classification of the giraffe - medusa and uves spectra , respectively .    as demonstrated by many authors @xcite , because of the presence of tio and vo absorption bands which are sensitive to the surface gravity , most of the m - type pms objects show spectroscopic features that can be better reproduced by averaging dwarf and giant spectra with the same spectral type .",
    "thus , in performing the spectral type classification of the young objects in cha  ii , both dwarf and giant templates were included in our grids of reference spectra .",
    "furthermore , for spectral types later than m0 , we also included _",
    "ad hoc _ templates obtained by averaging the collected spectra of dwarfs and giants with the same spectral type .",
    "the template spectra were first normalized to the continuum through a low - order polynomial fit , in the same way as the target spectra ( cf .",
    "  [ specfallup ] ) .",
    "the standard spectra were then shifted in wavelength to the radial velocity of the target .",
    "finally , a chi - square minimization procedure was applied to choose the template that best fits the observed spectrum .    from an inspection of the residual we estimated an accuracy on the resulting spectral types within one spectral sub - class for objects earlier than @xmath10k7 and about half spectral sub - class for later objects .",
    "we could perform a reasonable spectroscopic classification for all the sources observed with flames , except for sz  47 , iras  f12571 - 7657 and sstc2d  j130521.7 - 773810 .",
    "the former object was classified as m0 by @xcite , but we observe signatures of a much earlier spectral type ; for instance , a strong he  i @xmath136678     line in absorption and a rising continuum with shorter wavelength . already in the low - resolution spectrum presented by @xcite the he  i absorption is clearly visible .",
    "such spectral features resemble those of an early type object",
    ". this effect might be due to the strong interaction of the star with the disk .",
    "in fact sz  47 is another case of veiled star in cha  ii .",
    "the spectra of iras  f12571 - 7657 and sstc2d  j130521.7 - 773810 are rather noisy and although we manage to perform a fit of a k3 and k6 templates respectively , from the almost pure - continuum appearance of their spectra , they may be classified as continuum - type or `` c - typ '' objects .",
    "the spectral types are provided in table  [ pms_objects_a ] .",
    "@xcite reported spectral types for 20 stars in cha  ii ; 17 of these were observed by us with flames . in most cases ,",
    "we find a good agreement of the spectral types reported by these authors within one spectral sub - class . in a few cases ( e.g. sz  47 and sz  62 ) larger residuals ,",
    "up to two spectral sub - classes , are found .",
    "for these objects the spectral type determination becomes more uncertain because of veiling .    among the sample of spectroscopically confirmed pms objects",
    "there are some with spectral types m5 or later , which correspond to objects very close or below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "these include objects confirmed in this work and two very low - mass bds discovered by @xcite . for the latter",
    "we adopt the spectral types and temperatures recently determined by @xcite .",
    "further discussion of these objects is presented in   [ substellar_objs ]",
    ".      for the confirmed pms objects , the effective temperature ( t@xmath17 ) was determined by using the tabulations of temperature as a function of spectral type proposed by @xcite and @xcite . consistently with our spectral classification , the dwarf temperature scale by @xcite was considered for objects earlier than m0 , while for later objects we adopted the tabulation by @xcite , which is intermediate between dwarf and giant scales .",
    "the errors on t@xmath17 were estimated considering a mean uncertainty of one sub - class on the spectral type classification .",
    "a different approach was followed for the objects lacking spectroscopy . in these cases ,",
    "the effective temperature and extinction were simultaneously derived by fitting a grid of reference seds to their sed , as prescribed by @xcite , but using the @xcite extinction law ( see also   [ ext ] ) . to this aim",
    ", we used the observed fluxes presented in paper  i and restricted the fit to the short - wavelength portion of the sed ( @xmath18 ) , which is less contaminated by possible ir excess .",
    "when possible , these temperature values were also checked by using the t@xmath17 vs. ( @xmath19 ) calibration relation determined by @xcite ; the eso - wfi ( @xmath19 ) color index is sensitive to the effective temperature for very cool objects ( 2000  k@xmath20t@xmath213800  k ) because the medium - band filter centred at 856 nm covers important tio absorption features that deepen with decreasing temperature , while the one centred at 914 nm lies in a wavelength range relatively featureless in late - type objects . in the case of high interstellar extinction ( a@xmath225  mag ) the temperature derived from this relation may be underestimated because the ( @xmath19 ) index becomes larger than in the absence of extinction .",
    "the two methods yield consistent results and turn out to be accurate within 200k relative to the spectroscopic temperature estimated for the objects observed with flames .    the effective temperatures for pms objects and candidates in cha  ii are reported in table  [ pms_objects_b ] .",
    "the extinction has been determined for each individual pms object using the relation @xmath23 obtained from the extinction law by @xcite for r@xmath24=5.5 ( hereafter wd5.5 ) ; indeed , investigations on the properties of the interstellar medium in the chamaeleon clouds have demonstrated that the r@xmath24 ratio is unusually high ( i.e. @xmath25=5 - 6 ) in the densest parts of the clouds @xcite .",
    "for details on this issue we refer the reader to paper  i. the @xmath26 color excess was derived from the compilation of colors as a function of spectral type proposed by @xcite and @xcite for spectral types earlier than m1 and later than m0 , respectively .",
    "the spectral types determined as explained in   [ spectyp ] and reported in table  [ pms_objects_a ] were used to this aim . for objects lacking the @xmath27 or @xmath28 band magnitudes , also because of saturation",
    ", we used the intrinsic @xmath29 color versus spectral type relation by @xcite , and determine the extinction as @xmath30 , also using the wd5.5 extinction law .",
    "this was the case for some iras sources which are very bright also in the optical ( see   [ sec_hrd ] ) .",
    "this latter approach was also used for c  41 and sz  49 , for which the @xmath31 color is strongly affected by the intense h@xmath3 emission and veiling .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath32 , derived from the uncertainties on spectral classification , range from 0.1 to less than 1  mag .    for the objects lacking spectroscopy ,",
    "the @xmath32 and t@xmath17 values were derived simultaneously following the sed minimization procedure prescribed by @xcite .",
    "we used the observed fluxes presented in paper  i and also adopted the wd5.5 extinction law .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this method provides @xmath32 values consistent with those derived from spectroscopy within 1.5mag .",
    "such uncertainty translates into an average uncertainty of 0.15  dex in the logarithm of luminosity for the pms candidates in cha  ii .",
    "the extinction at each wavelength , @xmath33 , has been then determined both for the pms objects and the candidates also using the wd5.5 extinction law .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , our extinction determinations are in general agreement with the values reported by the large - scale extinction maps of the cha  ii cloud .      because of the presence of circumstellar material , the seds of young objects may be affected by the presence of ir excess and hot continuum emission from the boundary layer between the disk and the central star , whose intensities depend on the evolutionary stage of the star . in order to separate the properties of the central star alone and the disk , their contributions to the `` total '' luminosity of the system must be determined .",
    "the `` total '' luminosities of the young objects in cha  ii , obtained by direct integration of the dereddened seds , have been already reported in paper  i. in that paper we concentrate on the disk contribution , which provides an interesting diagnostic for the study of the accretion activity of pms objects . here",
    "we focus on the contribution of the central star alone , which allows us to place the cha  ii members and candidates on the hr diagram and hence derive their masses and ages .",
    "the stellar luminosities and radii for the cha  ii population were computed following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we compared the dereddened sed of each object with a reference sed of the same temperature scaled to the distance ( d=178  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "the grid of reference seds was built using the model spectra by @xcite and @xcite as explained in @xcite . by minimizing the flux differences between the dereddened sed and the reference one",
    ", we determine the stellar radius ( r@xmath34 ) and hence , the photospheric luminosity ( l@xmath34 ) .",
    "the minimization procedure was performed , as above , on the short - wavelength portion of the sed ( @xmath18 ) , in order to avoid contamination from possible ir excesses .",
    "errors on luminosities have been estimated taking the uncertainty on spectral classification and extinction ( i.e. @xmath101 and 2 spectral sub - class for objects with and without spectroscopy , respectively ) , as well as on the distance to cha  ii ( @xmath1020  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into account .",
    "we also checked that using extinction laws other than the wd5.5 , such as those by @xcite and @xcite , does not affect significantly our luminosity estimates .",
    "the r@xmath34 and l@xmath34 values and relative uncertainties are reported in table  [ pms_objects_b ] .      the positions on the hr diagram of the pms objects and candidates in cha  ii are presented in figure  [ hrd ] over - plotted on three sets of evolutionary tracks .",
    "except for a few cases discussed next , the vast majority of the confirmed pms objects and candidates fall in regions of the hr diagram consistent with very young objects ( age@xmath354  myr ) , down to the bd regime .",
    "the luminosity and temperature of five objects are , however , inconsistent with those of pms stars in cha  ii ; these objects are marked with arrows in figure  [ hrd ] and correspond to the five iras sources discussed in   5.4 of paper  i. these sources are iras12416 - 7703 , iras12448 - 7650 , irasf12488 - 7658 , iras12556 - 7731 and iras12589 - 7646 , which would be over - luminous in the hr diagram .",
    "note that one of these , i.e. iras  12556 - 7731 , has been spectroscopically confirmed to be a pms object (   [ results ] ) .",
    "possible reasons for the inconsistent position of these objects on the hr diagram may be an erroneous estimate of temperature and consequently of extinction .",
    "it is worth to mention , however , that all these iras sources are very bright ( @xmath36 ) and are saturated in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 band wfi images ( c.f .",
    "* ) . as explained in ",
    "[ ext ] , the extinction in these cases was determined on the basis of the @xmath29 color index .",
    "note that none of the five iras sources show very strong ir excess , with most of them expected to be class  iii sources .",
    "therefore , the methods applied here to determine their temperature and extinction are reliable .",
    "in addition , the visual extinction for these objects is less than about 4  mag . note that at least in the case of iras12556 - 7731",
    ", the spectral type and temperature are fairly well constrained from its spectrum . yet",
    ", this object is over - luminous at the same degree as the other four iras sources .",
    "interestingly , while being scattered in the region ( see figure  10 in paper  i ) , the five iras sources seem to follow the form of an isochrone on the hr diagram .",
    "thus , another possible explanation for the inconsistency may be that the distance for these five iras sources has been overestimated .",
    "in order for them to have a position on the diagram consistent with pms objects ( age@xmath354  myr ) , their distance should be on the order of 30  pc .",
    "alternatively , they could be foreground dwarfs , unrelated to cha  ii and the apparent ir excess by which some of them were selected might simply be due to cool companions .",
    "more spectroscopic data are necessary in order to shed light on the nature of these outliers .",
    "the immediate consequence is that their mass and age can not be determined here .",
    "we have derived masses and ages of the cha  ii members and candidates by comparison of the location of the objects on the hr diagram with the pms tracks by @xcite & @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . since stellar evolutionary models are rather uncertain , particularly in the low - mass and sub - stellar regimes",
    ", the use of different evolutionary models allows us to estimate the uncertainties of the stellar parameters due to modeling alone . in table",
    "[ tab : par2 ] we report the masses and ages for all the confirmed cha  ii members and candidates whose position on the hr diagram is consistent with membership to the cloud .",
    "most of the cha  ii pms members have masses in the range @xmath37 ; iras  12496 - 7650 ( dk  cha ) is the only intermediate mass star in the cloud .",
    "the mass distribution of the cha  ii members , which is shown in figure  [ mass_age ] ( left panel ) , peaks between 0.3 and 0.4  @xmath2 and the mean mass ranges from 0.4 to about 0.6  @xmath2 , depending on the adopted evolutionary track ( c.f .",
    "table  [ tab : sf ] ) .",
    "the resulting average mass is 0.5@xmath380.1  @xmath2 , with the error representing the uncertainty due to modeling .",
    "it is important to note that these values are basically the same when including the candidates .",
    "note also that the resulting values for the ysos alone , also reported in table  [ tab : sf ] , fall in the same range .",
    "the average mass is similar to the values obtained for cha  i ( @xmath100.45 @xmath2 ) and taurus ( 0.50 @xmath2 ) populations , indicating that a value of the order of 0.5@xmath2 might be a characteristic average mass for objects in t associations .",
    "the age distributions , resulting from the adopted models , are presented in the right panels of figure  [ mass_age ] .",
    "the vast majority of pms objects and candidates are younger than 4  myr .",
    "the mean age of the cha  ii population ranges from 3 to 6  myr depending on the adopted model ( table  [ tab : sf ] ) . independently of whether or not the candidates",
    "are included , the average age is 4@xmath382  myr with the error coming from the modeling alone . within the uncertainties ,",
    "this value is in agreement with that derived by @xcite .",
    "the mean age for the ysos alone , also reported in table  [ tab : sf ] , is lower ( @xmath102  myr ) , though not significantly ; this is expected since objects with strong ir excess are representative of an earlier evolutionary phase .",
    "the majority of the objects have ages of 3 - 4 myr , depending on the models . therefore , star formation proceeded in a short time , producing a coeval population .",
    "if the star formation in cha  ii occurred very recently , say within the last myrs , the circumstellar disks of the pms objects in this region may have not yet had the time to evolve into optically thin disks .",
    "in other words , this may indicate that star formation in chamaeleon has occurred rapidly a few million years ago .",
    "the analysis of the ir properties of the young population in cha  ii presented in paper  i shows that only three class  i sources exist in the cloud , namely iras  12500 - 7658 , iras  12553 - 7651 ( or iso - chaii28 ) and iras  13036 - 7644 ( or bhr  86 ) .",
    "in these cases we can not apply the above procedures for the determination of the stellar parameters .",
    "indeed , the large extinction coupled with strong ir excess due to the thick envelope / disk , makes it difficult to disentangle the properties of the central object from those of the circumstellar regions . since most of the emission of class  i sources is in the ir , one way to determine their properties",
    "is by fitting a disk accretion model to their sed . from such fit",
    "it is possible to provide an estimate of the temperature and other physical parameters of the central object .",
    "this has been done for the cha  ii class  i sources in paper  i by using the sed models for young stellar objects by @xcite .",
    "thus , for iras  12500 - 7658 and iso - chaii28 we report in table  [ pms_objects_b ] the values obtained in paper  i , which have been also used to place them on the hr diagram ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ hrd ] ) . for iras  13036 - 7644",
    "the sed modeling results are unreliable because it is not detected neither in the optical nor in the near - ir ; this object has been matter of focused c2d observations which will be presented in a future paper .",
    "we warn the reader that iso - chaii28 is not detected in the optical and only a flux upper limit is available in the @xmath39-band from the 2mass catalog .",
    "thus , visual extinction and other stellar parameters resulting from the sed modeling must be taken with care .",
    "the stellar parameters estimated for iras  12500 - 7658 point toward a very cool low - mass object . since this object has been detected in the optical survey by @xcite , we could independently estimate its stellar parameters using the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the wfi ( @xmath19 ) index of iras  12500 - 7658 indicates an effective temperature of 3000@xmath38200  k. assuming this temperature , we estimate a visual extinction a@xmath40 , an object luminosity of 0.0067  l@xmath4 , an integrated luminosity of 0.9  l@xmath4 and a stellar mass of about 0.06  m@xmath4",
    ". these values are roughly consistent with those derived by using the @xcite disk models .",
    "however , we remind that the effective temperature estimates from the wfi ( @xmath19 ) index may be significantly affected by extinction , therefore they are rather uncertain .",
    "there are several objects which fall close to or below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "three , namely sstc2d  j125758.7 - 770120 , iso - chaii13 , and sstc2d  j130540.8 - 773958 , are spectroscopically confirmed to be sub - stellar @xcite , while four ( wfi  j12533662 - 7706393 , wfi  j12583675 - 7704065 , wfi  j13005297 - 7709478 and wfi  j13031615 - 7629381 ) are candidates to be sub - stellar .",
    "on the other hand , five sources ( c41 , c50 , c62 , c66 and wfij12585611 - 7630105 ) are spectroscopically confirmed to be very low - mass pms stars close to the hydrogen burning limit , while the temperature estimate of iras12500 - 7658 is consistent with an object close to this limit (   [ classi ] ) .    considering only the certified pms objects",
    ", the fraction of sub - stellar objects relative to pms stars would be on the order of 6% , i.e. lower than in other t associations .",
    "it is clear that this result may change slightly because of the fact that several of the objects fall just above or below the hydrogen burning limit and because of the uncertainties in spectral types and of the difference in the adopted pms evolutionary models . in whatever case",
    ", the fraction may be slightly lower than , but very close to the values reported for other t associations ( 12 - 14% , * ? ? ?",

    "this points toward a sub - stellar imf for cha  ii similar to that found in other t associations .",
    "more discussion on the cha  ii imf is deferred to   [ imf ] .",
    "fundamental physical parameters , i.e. mass and age of the individual pms objects , have been now determined ; moreover , as discussed in paper  i , the census of cha  ii members is rather complete down to the sub - stellar regime ( @xmath41 , * ? ? ?",
    "then , the implications on the star formation in the cloud can be investigated on the basis of usual quantities such as the star formation efficiency , the trend of the mass spectrum and the star formation rate .",
    "some aspects of the star formation history of the cloud are also discussed .      despite the considerable theoretical and observational work establishing the general form of the imf @xcite ,",
    "the question whether there are differences in the imf under different star - forming conditions is still an open issue .",
    "this is particularly controversial in the very - low mass and sub - stellar regimes .",
    "recent studies @xcite show that the imf remains approximately flat or shows a moderate decline in the bd regime .",
    "nevertheless , there is no systematic indication of such a turnover .",
    "other regions have been found where the imf appears to rise below the sub - stellar limit @xcite .    as mentioned in previous sections , recent investigations and this work",
    "provide a pms population in cha  ii which is basically complete .",
    "although some of the candidates still lack spectroscopic confirmation , this census is useful for a first inspection on the mass spectrum of the region . by assuming that all the candidates are true cha  ii members , we attempted the imf determination by using the approximation for the low - mass end of the mass function , @xmath42 @xcite , adopting mass bins of 0.2  @xmath2 ( c.f . figure  [ chaii_imf ] ) ; this value is larger than the accuracy on mass estimates derived from the uncertainties on temperature and luminosity and , at the same time , allows to have a statistically valid number of objects at each bin .",
    "the value of the slope @xmath3 varies between 0.4 and 1 depending on the adopted evolutionary tracks .",
    "the resulting average value in the mass range @xmath43  @xmath2 is @xmath3=0.5 - 0.6 depending on the inclusion of the candidates ( see figure  [ chaii_imf ] ) .    despite the problems arising mainly from the still uncertain nature of some of the candidates , as well as from the presence of unresolved binaries ,",
    "our estimate of the imf slope in cha  ii is fairly consistent with the imf slopes measured in other the t associations ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , notwithstanding the uncertainties and low statistics , our first imf study in cha  ii gives further evidence of the stellar imf being roughly invariant down to the hydrogen burning limit .    the binary star fraction ( bsf ) in cha  ii",
    "is expected to be on the order of 13 - 15% @xcite and does not significantly affect the shape of the imf . by assuming a bsf=15% and a uniform distribution of this fraction of unresolved binaries in the range 0.1 - 2 @xmath2 , we used the simulation of binary systems by @xcite to investigate their effects on the stellar positions in the hr diagram and hence , on the imf .",
    "we estimate a variation of the @xmath3 slope to be @xmath100.1 , i.e. well within the uncertainty due to modeling .",
    "four of the seven objects ( i.e. @xmath10 60% ) below the h - burning limit are not yet spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "therefore , any concluding statement on the sub - stellar imf in cha  ii is still premature and must be deferred to the future , when the proposed sub - stellar candidates will be confirmed or rejected as members of the cloud .",
    "if all the sub - stellar candidates were confirmed as members , then the sub - stellar imf in cha  ii would be as in other t associations , otherwise it would have a significant drop , with only three sub - stellar members .",

    "we investigate the global sfe and sf  rate , but using the individual masses and ages of the members as estimated in   [ sec_mass_age ] .",

    "moreover sstc2d  j130529.0 - 774140 and iras  13036 - 7644 are not detected in optical and near - ir wavelengths and hence , their stellar parameters could not be determined . in performing the following calculations",
    ", we assumed for these nine objects the average mass , i.e. 0.5  @xmath2 .",
    "however , their inclusion does not affect the final results .",
    "we derived the sfe as in paper  i , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cloud mass , and @xmath46 is the total mass in pms objects .",
    "we use the estimate of the cloud mass ( 670  m@xmath4 , see paper  i ) as derived from the c2d extinction map with the 240 arc - sec resolution ; other estimates are present in the literature which vary between 700 and 1250 m@xmath4 depending on the tracer molecule used .",
    "considering the uncertainty on the cloud mass and on the total mass in pms objects , which depends on the adopted evolutionary tracks ( table  [ tab : sf ] ) , we find that the sfe in cha  ii ranges between 1 - 4% , regardless of the inclusion of the candidates .",
    "lower values ( 1 - 2% ) are found when considering the ysos alone .",
    "a summary of the global sfe estimates is reported in table  [ tab : sf ] .",
    "our sfe results agree with previous estimates ( @xmath101% , * ? ? ?",

    "a considerably higher value for the cha  ii cloud mass ( i.e. 1860  m@xmath4 ) was reported by @xcite on the basis of a @xmath47 map of the cloud . using this estimate",
    ", we obtain values around 1% for the sfe , which are still consistent with the range of values expected in t associations .",
    "interestingly , the sfe in cha  ii is lower than in cha  i ( 7 - 13% , * ? ? ? * ) and this may be a consequence of a different history of star formation in the chamaeleon clouds , as discussed in paper  i.    the sf  rate has been determined using the total mass of pms objects and candidates in cha  ii and their average age as reported in table  [ tab : sf ] .",
    "we performed this exercise by using three different sets of evolutionary models and the results are summarized in table  [ tab : sf ] .",

    "the stellar parameters of the pms objects and candidates have been determined .",
    "most objects in cha  ii have masses in the range @xmath37 .",
    "the average mass is 0.5@xmath380.1  @xmath2 , with the error representing the uncertainty due to modeling .",
    "the mean age of the cha  ii population ranges from 2 to 6  myr depending on the adopted model .",
    "the average age is 4@xmath382  myr with the error coming from modeling alone .",
    "the average age drops to about 2  myr when considering the ysos , i.e. the ir - excess population selected from the c2d multi - color criteria .",
    "seven objects ( three confirmed plus four candidates ) are sub - stellar and another five are confirmed to be very low - mass pms stars close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "in addition , the low luminosity ( @xmath66 0.007 ) object detected in the optical and matching the position of the class  i source iras12500 - 7658 might also have a mass close to the sub - stellar limit or may be a highly extincted object .",
    "results on the global properties of star formation in cha  ii are the following .",
    "the average value of the imf slope bf ( @xmath3=0.5 - 0.6 ) in the mass range @xmath43  @xmath2 is fairly consistent with those measured in other t associations .",
    "our first study of the mass spectrum in cha  ii seems to provide further evidence for the stellar imf being roughly the same as the field imf down to the hydrogen burning limit , but the results depend on the adopted evolutionary models .",
    "the star formation efficiency of 1 - 4% is similar to our estimates for other t associations like taurus and lupus , but significantly lower than for cha  i ( @xmath107% ) .",
    "this suggests that different star - formation activities in the chamaeleon clouds may reflect a different history of star formation .",
    "the cha  ii cloud turns about 8@xmath2 into stars every myr , i.e. much less than the star formation rate in the other c2d clouds .",
    "however , the star formation rate is not steady and there is evidence of acceleration of star formation , as seen in other star forming regions .",
    "this , together with the results of paper  i on the high disk fraction , may indicate that the star formation in cha  ii possibly occurred rapidly a few million years ago , which would explain the scarcity of disk - less stars in the region .",
    "we have also investigated possible links between the stellar and the disk properties .",
    "we find a fair indication that more luminous objects have more luminous disks , which suggests a possible correlation between stellar mass and disk luminosity via the pms mass - luminosity relation . about 10% of the objects with m@xmath500.27  m@xmath51 possess disks more massive than 0.025  m@xmath51 , further supporting recent ideas that the presence of massive disks might be a consequence of the `` isolated '' star - forming mode with respect to the `` clustered '' one .",
    "finally , the strength of the h@xmath3 emission line of the pms stars in cha  ii behaves as in other young populations in other regions .",
    "we find that objects with optically thick disks show strong h@xmath3 emission , suggesting that the gaseous and dust components of disks evolve on similar timescales .",
    "the correlation between the h@xmath3 emission and the ir excess emission allowed us to identify various spitzer colors in the range 3.6 - 70  @xmath14 m that can be used as tracers of the accretion process , but different colors trace different disk regions .",
    "we are grateful to anonymous referee for his / her very constructive comments and suggestions .",
    "this paper is based on observations carried out at the european southern observatory , paranal ( chile ) , under observing programs numbers 076.c-0385 and 078.c-0293 .",

    "<S> the star formation efficiency in the cloud ( 1 - 4% ) is consistent with our own estimates for taurus and lupus , but significantly lower than for cha  i. this might mean that different star - formation activities in the chamaeleon clouds may reflect a different history of star formation . </S>",
