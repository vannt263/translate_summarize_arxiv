    ", the ground state for three - flavor quark matter is a homogeneous color - flavor locked state in which all nine quarks , associated with three colors and three flavors , are gapped @xcite .",
    "however , color superconducting states , if occurring in compact stars , would not be necessarily homogeneous .",
    "this is because a separation of the fermi surface develops between paired quarks in a realistic situation characterized by nonzero strange quark mass , color and electric charge neutrality , and weak equilibrium .",
    "once the separation becomes comparable to the gap magnitude , a usual bcs state can be energetically unfavorable because of the inevitable increase in the loss of the quark kinetic energy .",
    "even in this situation , it is possible to consider other homogeneous paired states such as a gapless state in which quark quasiparticles which are gapped in the absence of the fermi surface separation become gapless @xcite , a color - flavor locked state with condensation of collective modes carrying the same quantum number as mesons @xcite , and a paired state with nonspherical fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "importantly , these homogeneous states are not always stable against inhomogeneities .",
    "the most remarkable example is a chromomagnetic instability of the gapless states which is characterized by negative meissner masses squared @xcite ; this signifies that fluctuations in the gluon fields or , equivalently , the phases of the order parameter @xcite , develops spontaneously .",

    "] so far , many states involving inhomogeneities in the quark densities and/or the order parameter @xcite have been proposed for an eventual stable state after the onset of the chromomagnetic instability , but a systematic energy comparison between them and even a systematic instability analysis with respect to various possible inhomogeneities remain to be performed .    in this paper , as a first step towards such a systematic analysis , we utilize density functional theory to investigate instabilities of a two - flavor homogeneous gapless state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in the quark and electron densities and in the phases and amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "here we do not address what the ground state is , but all we can clarify is to identify inhomogeneities that grow spontaneously in the homogeneous system , from which we can anticipate what kind of inhomogeneous state is likely to be realized .",
    "possibly , the growth of fluctuations in the phases and/or amplitude of the order parameter would end up with a larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state @xcite in which periodic spatial oscillations occur in the phases and/or amplitude , while the simultaneous growth of fluctuations in the density difference between up and down quarks and the gap magnitude could lead to a bcs - normal coexisting phase @xcite .",
    "we take into account finite size corrections such as the energies arising from the density and gap gradients and the electrostatic and color coulomb energies to deduce the structure of the coexisting phase .",
    "we find that electric charge screening , which is automatically included in the present density functional analysis , is crucial to such deduction .",

    "note that the second derivative ( [ omegadd ] ) , which is relevant for @xmath172 , can be negative only in the gapless sc state , implying that this comes from the presence of the gapless modes .",
    "the associated instability remains in the limit of @xmath173 in gapless neutral superfluids @xcite which are generally unstable with respect to homogeneous ( @xmath172 ) change in the gap amplitude , while neutrality constraints keep the gapless charged superconductors stable against homogeneous change in the gap magnitude .",
    "this is because this change is accompanied by homogeneous change in the quark and electron densities , leading to increase in the total kinetic energy .",
    "it is important to note that at nonzero @xmath174 , the system becomes more unstable by having the energy lowered by the gradient energy term associated with inhomogeneities in the gap amplitude in the gapless phase where the stiffness parameters are negative .",
    "then the neutrality constraints no longer hinder the system from undergoing the instability at nonzero @xmath174 .",
    "this implies the tendency towards a loff state in which the gap amplitude oscillates . in general , the gap amplitude instability develops in the gapless state together with the chromomagnetic instability , though we will refer to this situation simply as the instability with respect to the gap amplitude .",
    "we finally consider the case in which inhomogeneities are present only in the quark and electron densities .",
    "the possible occurrence of instabilities depends on the structure of @xmath175 . in order for the system to be stable against small density modulations ,",
    "all eigenvalues of this hermitian matrix must be positive , i.e. , any minors of the determinant must be positive .",
    "this condition holds both for the 2sc state and for the gapless 2sc state .",
    "it is nonetheless important to note that the fermi surface separation between @xmath53 and @xmath52 quarks can vary nonuniformly in the gapless 2sc state , which is driven by the gap amplitude instability discussed above in such a way that as the gap amplitude increases , the fermi surface separation decreases .",
    "generally , such density variation produces a positive gradient energy .",
    "if this energy dominates over the gradient energy associated with inhomogeneities in the gap amplitude , one can expect that the system tends to a coexisitng phase of large bcs ( 2sc ) domains with small fermi surface separation and large normal domains with large separation @xcite .",
    "this phase can be viewed as a state in which clustering of @xmath53 quarks occurs within normal domains .    in order to clarify what kind of structure this clustering takes on",
    ", one needs to take full account of inhomogeneities in the densities and the gap amplitude ; this account would automatically involve charge screening , which plays an important role in determining the structure .",
    "this structure lies in between the strong screening limit ( phase separation ) and the screeningless limit , as will be quantified in the next section .",
    "we remark that the same kind of phase separation was recently observed in a superfluid gas of atomic fermions with unequal numbers of two components @xcite .",
    "in this section we systematically consider inhomogeneities in the quark and electron densities and in the phases and amplitude of the order parameter to determine the kind of inhomogeneities that spontaneously develop in the 2sc and gapless 2sc states . in doing so , we first focus on the bulk ( @xmath174 independent ) part of the effective potential for the variation of the gap amplitude .",
