    "the corresponding masses of a pion on the lattice  defined as the lowest lying @xmath14 state in the simulation  are larger than @xmath15gev , quite far above the physical value @xmath16gev .    in the limit @xmath17 ,",
    "on the other hand , low - energy 2-flavor qcd displays a spontaneously broken chiral @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "pions as massless goldstone bosons are the relevant degrees of freedom of the ( effective ) theory .",
    "their coupling to baryons is also subject to the rules imposed by chiral symmetry .",

    "@xcite and references therein .    for baryon properties",
    "the interpolation between lattice results obtained at relatively large pion masses and actual observables determined at the physical @xmath2 has become an issue of great interest recently .",
    "chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) can , in principle , provide such extrapolations .",
    "first steps in this direction were made by leinweber et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of the magnetic moments .",
    "they used pad approximants based on the leading dependence on the pion mass as dictated by chiral symmetry .",
    "a perturbative analysis of nucleon magnetic moments , using cheft with explicit inclusion of the @xmath3(1230 ) isobar , has been performed in @xcite .",
    "it turned out to be of crucial importance to promote the isovector couplings of the @xmath3 to leading order in the power counting characteristic of chiral effective theories .",
    "truncated versions of chiral perturbation theory usually `` freeze '' the @xmath3 and relegate its effects to higher order counterterms , with the consequence that the range of convergence of this truncated theory is often quite limited . the importance of the @xmath3 as an explicit degree of freedom in various aspects of nucleon substructure has long been known .",
    "it has played a prominent part in chiral models of the nucleon @xcite and earlier studies based on current algebra @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the quark mass dependence of @xmath0 , the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon .",
    "this is a key quantity for our understanding of the nucleon s chiral structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lattice qcd determinations of @xmath0 are progressing to the point where such an investigation is in demand for interpolating between lattice data and the actual observable @xcite .",
    "of course plenty of cheft calculations pertaining to this quantity exist in the literature @xcite , and the special importance of intermediate spin 3/2 resonance contributions for the axial properties of baryons has been recognized a long time ago .",

    "is calculated from the response of a baryon to the presence of an external background field with axial quantum number .",
    "in contrast to many earlier cheft calculations_e.g . _ the pioneering ones of refs.@xcite  we are _ not only _ interested in the non - analytic quark mass behaviour generated by the goldstone boson cloud around the baryon . in order to analyze the quark mass dependence of a baryon observable in a quantitative way",
    "we follow the same philosophy as spelled out in ref.@xcite .",
    "we specify a power counting scheme plus a certain order in that scheme and then systematically evaluate all contributions  short- and long - distance  to that order .",
    "it turns out that the role of short - distance physics parameterized as higher order operators in chiral effective field theory is crucial for an understanding of the chiral extrapolation function @xmath5 .",
    "we utilize the so - called su(2 ) `` small scale expansion '' of ref.@xcite to leading - one - loop order ( @xmath24 ) , which includes explicit nucleon and @xmath3(1230 ) degrees of freedom ",
    "some details regarding the formalism are summarized in section [ 2 ] .",
    "in fact , all the long- and short - distance contributions considered in our analysis have already been found ( as a by - product ) in ref.@xcite , where among other topics the ( small ) momentum dependence of the axial form factors of the nucleon was studied .",
    "here we reconsider these results and focus on the quark mass dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the situation in the vector current sector , where a modified power counting had to be developed @xcite so that important effects of the @xmath3 could be captured already in leading - one - loop order , this turns out not to be necessary for axial current effects related to the @xmath3(1230 ) . for the _ axial structure of baryons_which is the topic of the present analysis  the standard counting of cheft , as employed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is sufficient to obtain @xmath3(1230 ) induced quark mass dependence already at the leading - one - loop level . throughout this work",
    "we can therefore apply standard ( `` naive '' ) counting rules .",
    "historically , attempts to obtain a chiral extrapolation function for @xmath0 based on the known leading - non - analytic ( lna ) quark mass dependence in combination with a phenomenological ( quark mass dependent ) regularization procedure did not yield satisfactory results , displaying axial couplings less than unity at the physical point @xcite . in our opinion",
    "one should not have been surprised about such a failure , as the lna quark mass term presumably is only dominant for quark masses near the extreme chiral limit of the theory .",
    "such a feature was indeed observed in the analysis of the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "recently , detmold et al .",
    "@xcite in their analysis of moments of polarized dis structure functions , found an improved extrapolation formula for @xmath5 utilizing a chiral quark model which also allows for contributions from intermediate @xmath3(1230 ) states @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting extrapolation function  which has most of the @xmath3(1230 ) related couplings fixed from su(6 ) symmetry  still does not provide for an enhancement of @xmath5 near the physical point , which would at the same time connect with the lattice results . in this work",
    "we go beyond the existing analyses by performing a systematic perturbative calculation of _ all _ short- and long - distance contributions which are allowed to leading - one - loop order in chiral power counting .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief summary of the cheft formalism utilized here . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we present the leading - one - loop analytic result for @xmath0 both in a scheme without and in one with explicit @xmath3(1230 ) degrees of freedom . in section",
    "[ 4 ] we compare these analytic results with recent data from the qcdsf collaboration @xcite , employing three different fit procedures . finally , in section [ 5 ] we check the stability of the obtained results by including the physically known information about @xmath0 as an additional constraint in the fit . the resulting chiral extrapolation function @xmath5 provides a sensible description of the quark mass dependence from the chiral limit over the physical point out to the present lattice data .",
    "we conclude with an outlook on further investigations required for a better understanding of @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis of @xmath0 is based on chiral effective field theory with two light flavors @xmath25 .",
    "we work to leading - one - loop order .",
    "all other quark degrees of freedom are integrated out , leaving their marks only in slightly shifted values of couplings sensitive to short distance dynamics .",
    "this effective field theory of low - energy qcd acts with pions as goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral @xmath26 symmetry of qcd .",
    "in addition the chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian with two light flavours is explicitly broken by the small @xmath27 and @xmath28 quark masses which are treated as a perturbation .",
    "they shift the massless goldstone bosons to the physical pions with mass @xmath2 and lead to a string of quark mass dependent operators which turn out to be of crucial importance for the understanding of chiral extrapolation functions . at present",
    "we ignore effects of isospin breaking and work with degenerate masses , @xmath29 , for the up and down quarks .",
    "we utilize two versions of cheft for our analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "the first scheme is su(2 ) heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , which involves only the goldstone boson modes ( pions ) and spin 1/2 matter fields ( nucleons ) , taken up to order @xmath30 .",
    "the second scheme is the su(2 ) small scale expansion ( sse ) which in addition also involves explicit spin 3/2 matter fields ( four @xmath3(1230 ) states ) and their interactions with goldstone bosons , taken up to order @xmath31 in the `` small scale '' @xmath32 which now includes also the non - zero @xmath3-@xmath33 mass difference @xcite .    for completeness ",

    "differential cross sections into the leading - one - loop sse analysis .",
    "the solid line shows the central value , whereas the dashed curves denote the upper and lower error bar from eq.([gevcouplings ] ) .",
    "the matching of the coupling constants was performed at @xmath120 gev as discussed in the text.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    .",
    "the 2 parameters shown denote the nucleon coupling constant @xmath70 in the chiral limit versus the axial @xmath89 coupling @xmath48 .",
    "the three ellipses shown correspond to central , upper and lower values for the short distance couplings determined in eq.([gevcouplings ] ) at a scale of @xmath94 gev.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    finally , we comment on the validity of our matching procedure resulting in the couplings of eq.([gevcouplings ] ) .",
    "once the couplings are specified at one particular scale the resulting sse extrapolation curve shown in fig.[cfit ] does not depend anymore on @xmath58 , but it does depend on the matching point eq.([matching ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for each baryon observable there exists one unique curve through which the chiral limit value is approached when the quark masses go to zero .",
    "this is the reason why it is possible to utilize information about coupling constants in one version of cheft and transcribe it to another version of that theory . from eq.([gachiral ] ) we already know that the first two terms in the chiral expansion of @xmath5 are identical in hbchpt and sse , providing an important consistency check .",
    "however , the terms @xmath121 can be different between the two chefts  even when each one is evaluated at leading - one - loop order as done here  because the two schemes can build up the contributions to a particular term in the chiral expansion more or less effectively in their respective perturbative series .",
    "utilizing eq.([hbcouplings ] ) one finds @xmath122 for the chiral limit behaviour of the leading - one - loop hbchpt result of eq.([gaa ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "utilizing the parameters of fit iii ( c.f .",
    "table [ tab2 ] ) one obtains @xmath123 for the chiral limit behaviour of the leading - one - loop sse result of eq.([gasse ] ) .",
    "the @xmath87 terms agree within the error bars and the shifts of the central values could reasonably be accounted for by higher order corrections to the heavy baryon result of eq.([hbchir ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the matching procedure used in this work is consistent with all presently known information about the chiral limit of @xmath5 . in the next section",
    "we will test the stability of fit iii by including the physical point as an additional constraint for the fit and then conclude our analysis .",
    "in the previous section we have found that the leading - one - loop sse result eq.([gasse ] ) together with input from scattering analyses can provide a meaningful chiral extrapolation of the present lattice data which is consistent with the experimentally known value for @xmath0 . in order to test the stability of our result we now study the changes to our curves when we include the information at the physical point as an additional constraint together with the lattice data .",
    "reassuringly , one finds only small changes in the sse case .",
    "numerical values for the set of couplings labeled fit ivb are given in table [ tab2 ] , entirely consistent with the couplings of fit iii which does not know about the location of the physical point .",
    "the resulting extrapolation function is shown in fig.[bestfit ] , providing a sensible connection between the chiral limit value , the physical point and the qcdsf lattice data .",
    "we note that a large negative value of @xmath93 and @xmath124 are common features of fits iii and ivb , indicating that our reasoning provided in the previous section was on the right track .",
    "when taking the physical point as additional input , we can now also examine the validity of the leading - one - loop hbchpt extrapolation formula of eq.([gaa ] ) . in fit iva",
    "we have taken @xmath125 gev@xmath98 , which corresponds to the ( central ) value suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting ( short - dashed ) curve shown in fig.[bestfit ] completely misses the lattice data and leads to a substantially different chiral limit value @xmath70 , even if the rather large uncertainty in @xmath93 ( c.f . table [ tab2])indicated via the bands in fig.[bestfit2]is taken into account .",
    "according to our analysis this finding forces us to the conclusion that the leading - one - loop hbchpt curve as given in eq.([gaa ] ) is not sufficient to even perform the chiral extrapolation from the chiral limit to the physical point ! with the help of the decoupling constraints eq.([decoupling ] ) we have made sure that the chiral limit value of @xmath5 is the same in both approaches , as there exists only one definite axial charge of the nucleon in the chiral limit . in order to further test the applicability of the hbchpt curve we have also performed fit ivc , demanding that @xmath70 takes the same value as in the leading - one - loop sse analysis .",
    "the resulting ( long - dashed ) extrapolation curve is shown in fig.[bestfit ] .",
    "it only follows the sse curve for extremely small values of @xmath2 , misses the physical point and breaks down before it comes anywhere close to the existing lattice data .",
    "we therefore consider the use of eq.([gaa ] ) as not appropriate for a stable chiral extrapolation outside the region of the extreme chiral limit .",
    "we note that it is the very leading - one - loop hbchpt formula eq.([gaa ] ) that has been utilized recently in refs.@xcite to study the behaviour of the deuteron in the chiral limit . in view of the findings presented here",
    "the question arises whether conclusions drawn in refs.@xcite regarding the bound state nature of the deuteron are unaltered , when the chiral extrapolation of @xmath5 from the physical point down to the chiral limit follows the curve from fit ivb , rather than the one from iva as shown in fig.[bestfit ] .     as in the sse analysis of fit ivb.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     analysis of eq.([couplings]).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "to conclude , we summarize the main results of our work :    * the leading - one - loop hbchpt formula for @xmath5 eq.([gaa ] ) depends on two free parameters @xmath126 .",
    "crucial information on sign and size of @xmath74 can be obtained from analyses of the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "@xmath74 is large and negative for typical values of the regularization scale . * the leading - one - loop sse formula for @xmath5 eq.([gasse ] ) can be matched to the hbchpt formula in the chiral limit .",
    "it has sufficient quark mass dependent structures to provide a consistent chiral extrapolation from the chiral limit across the physical point up to the lattice data , assuming that the large quark mass quenched lattice data are consistent with fully dynamical simulations and that finite volume effects do not provide large corrections .",
    "* present lattice data are not precise enough in order to determine all couplings of the sse formula from the data alone .",
    "additional information from @xmath36 dynamics has to be invoked .",
    "su(6 ) arguments are not sufficient to generate the required form of @xmath5 . *",
    "the chiral extrapolation curve for @xmath5 is rather flat .",
    "it implies a co - operation of terms in the quark mass expansion such that pion cloud effects are basically `` turned off '' for pion masses exceeding @xmath127 gev .",
    "a small enhancement is seen around the physical pion mass .",
    "this enhancement results from an interplay between the goldstone boson dynamics of the nucleon and short distance contributions which can be constrained from @xmath4 scattering data .",
    "the chiral limit value of the axial coupling of the nucleon is found to be + @xmath128 + the parameters of fit ivb give the best available description of our present knowledge on @xmath5 . * the leading one - loop hbchpt formula ( [ gaa ] ) for @xmath5 is not useful for chiral extrapolation .",
    "it fails to connect the chiral limit with the physical value of the pion mass . according to our analysis the chiral logarithm as the leading non - analytic quark mass term in the hbchpt formula is only visible in extrapolations performed _ below _ the physical point .",
    "finally , we note that the role of finite size effects in the lattice data for @xmath0 has to be analyzed in a systematic framework to better understand the systematics of the lattice error bars .",
    "more data from simulations for @xmath5 performed at different lattice volumes are called for to guide these studies .",
