    "organic molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces are in the focus of current research both from a fundamental as well as an applied point of view . in this context",
    ", the strong electron acceptor tetracyanoethylene ( tcne ) has recently attracted a lot of interest .",
    "this molecule ( c@xmath0n@xmath1 ) consists of a double bond and four cyano groups .",
    "its disposition for electron - transfer reactions and its ability to bond to as many as four metal ions makes it a building block for technologically interesting assemblies like molecular magnets.@xcite transition metal compounds of tcne show a rich magnetic behavior , including systems with a high curie temperature up to @xmath2k .",
    "thin films of these systems deposited on a substrate offer appealing applications . for a deeper understanding of a molecular magnet built on a metal",
    "surface,@xcite a good knowledge of its components and their interaction with the substrate is essential . to this end , in ref .",
    "tcne molecules adsorbed on noble metal surfaces have been investigated employing scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) .",
    "interestingly , the observed bonding behavior turns out to be distinctly different on copper , silver and gold surfaces . on cu(001 ) , tcne forms tightly bound islands while loosely bound islands were identified on au(111).@xcite in contrast to this , tcne molecules on ag(001 ) occur for low coverage as isolated monomers.@xcite in the latter case , a structural model has been worked out on the basis of the measured stm images .",
    "an electron charge transfer from the silver substrate to the molecule has been inferred from a comparison of the observed sts images with charge distributions of prominent molecular orbitals resulting from calculations within density - functional theory for _ gas - phase _ neutral and negatively charged tcne molecules .",
    "very recently , adsorption of ordered tcne monolayers on ag(001 ) has been investigated in a combined study@xcite employing stm , inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and density - functional theory to reveal the structural and vibrational properties of this system",
    ". a theoretical investigation of _ isolated _ tcne adsorbed on ag(001 ) , however , is still missing .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structural and electronic properties of isolated tcne molecules adsorbed on ag(001 ) employing density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "our results explain interesting experimental findings@xcite that can not be deduced without ambiguity from a calculation for a gas - phase tcne molecule .",
    "we show that the structural model proposed in ref .   is confirmed by total energy calculations and that the prominent peak@xcite at @xmath3v in the experimental d@xmath4/d@xmath5 curves is in nice agreement with the calculated local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "furthermore , a trench around the tcne molecule is observed in the experimental stm images.@xcite employing two - dimensional fourier transform methods together with a spatial extrapolation of the wave function , our calculated sts and stm images reveal these experimental findings .",
    "our particular issue concerns the basis - set expansion used in this work .",
    "we employ gaussian orbitals that are centered at the atom positions .",
    "such basis functions may offer advantages for systems with much vacuum or with strongly localized wave functions .",
    "for the present focus of evaluation stm and sts images , however , localized orbitals suffer from the severe problem that they have no amplitude at the position of the stm tip , thus yielding no image . here",
    "we show that additional orbitals slightly above the surface and the adsorbate molecule , in combination with a spatial extrapolation technique , allows to evaluate stm and sts images at any tip height in a well - defined and reliable way .",
    "the present system of tcne adsorbed on ag(001 ) is an ideal test system for this approach due to the vast amount of experimental data under various conditions .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] the theoretical approach is described . after a short introduction to the subsystems ( sec .",
    "[ ss : adsorbate ] ) the structural and electronic properties of tcne on ag(001 ) are presented in secs .",
    "[ ss : position ] and [ ss : electronic ] , respectively .",
    "afterwards the resulting stm and sts images are discussed and compared to experiment ( sec .",
    "[ ss : stm ] ) .",
    "the calculations are carried out within the local density approximation ( lda ) of density - functional theory .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite in kleinman - bylander form @xcite including non - linear core corrections @xcite and the exchange - correlation functional of ceperley and adler @xcite in the parametrization of perdew and zunger@xcite are used in our work .",
    "in addition , we carry out calculations based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the formulation of perdew and wang.@xcite the wave functions are expanded in a basis of atom - centered gaussian orbitals of s , p , d and s@xmath6 symmetry with several decay constants per atom . , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for carbon and of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for nitrogen . for the atoms of the topmost",
    "silver layer decay constants of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are employed . for all other silver atoms @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "all decay constants are given in atomic units . ]",
    "the convergence of the basis has been carefully tested for the gas - phase molecule , for bulk ag and for the clean ag(001 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the basis gives bond lengths and lattice constants in good agreement with other theoretical investigations and with experiment .",
    "the wave function @xmath22 inside the crystal and the molecule and in the vicinity of the surface is well described by gaussian orbitals . in a stm or sts measurement ,",
    "however , a tip probes the wave function several ngstrm above the surface . for a reliable description of such experiments , it is essential to treat the decay of the wave function into the vacuum more accurately . to this end , we define a reference plane at height @xmath23 above the surface and molecule such that the potential @xmath24 is constant ( @xmath25 ) to reasonable accuracy above @xmath23 .",
    "we then extrapolate the wave function above the reference plane by the corresponding solutions of the schrdinger equation in the vacuum . here",
    "we give a brief outline of this procedure that has been described in more detail in ref .  .",
    "in the following we use a periodic surface , i.e. all states can be classified by a two - dimensional wave vector @xmath26 . the wave function is expanded for @xmath27 into a two - dimensional fourier sum @xmath28 with reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath29 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 obey the schrdinger equation for a particle in a constant potential ( @xmath31 ) , i.e. @xmath32 they decay exponentially into the vacuum @xmath33 with decay constants @xmath34 at the reference plane @xmath23 , the coefficients are determined by @xmath35 from the wave function @xmath36 evaluated in the gaussian basis on a real - space mesh @xmath37 . eventually , the wave function at the desired height @xmath38 is calculated from equation  ( [ eq : ftb ] ) .",
    "this method works well for `` flat '' systems , i.e. for systems in which all outermost atoms form a rather uniform `` plane '' without holes , dips , steps , etc .",
    "the ideal case would be a flat , clean surface or a dense monolayer of adsorbed molecules .",
    "in such case , a reference plane ( at height @xmath23 ) can be defined such that the distance to the nearest atoms underneath does not exceed @xmath39 - @xmath40at any lateral position and the atom - centered localized basis yields a stable wave function representation everywhere on the reference plane .    for a single adsorbate ,",
    "however , the reference plane at @xmath23 must be several ngstrm above the molecule ( in order to guarantee @xmath31 in the entire reference plane ) .",
    "in such a case , the distance between the _ surface _ and the reference plane is so large that the contributions from the surface itself to @xmath36 are not sufficiently described by the original gaussian basis , in particular at positions above the clean surface far away from the molecule .",
    "for this reason , the basis has to be improved by _",
    "additional orbitals _ in the empty space above the surface , i.e. at positions other than atoms .",
    "a typical arrangement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_side ] .",
    "we find that four orbitals per site ( one s orbital and three p orbitals ) with a small decay constant ( e.g. @xmath41 for a silver surface ) are sufficient to improve the description of the wave function significantly .",
    "we have checked that the results are insensitive to the number , positions and decay constants of these additional orbitals .      for the calculation of stm and sts images we use the tersoff - hamann theory,@xcite which describes the tunneling current @xmath4 as a function of the applied voltage @xmath5 by the integration of the local density of states @xmath42 and their derivative with respect to the voltage by @xmath43 the vector @xmath44 denotes the position of the tip which is in most cases several ngstrms above the surface .",
    "the operator @xmath45 describes the type of the tip.@xcite since the experiments often can not specify the details of their tips , we assume that the tip is of s - like nature , and thus set @xmath46 . to account for the discrete energy spectrum resulting from the supercell approach and for the finite @xmath47 point mesh employed in our work ,",
    "we include a spectral broadening of 0.2 ev for the calculation of stm and sts images . in the following",
    ", we present _ constant current _ images . to this end",
    ", the tunneling current is calculated at various heights and the height of the tip for a constant current is determined by a linear interpolation .",
    "the system we investigate is a tcne molecule adsorbed on a silver ( 001 ) surface .",
    "the calculations are carried out in a supercell .",
    "if not noted otherwise we use a slab with three layers containing @xmath48 silver atoms per layer ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this leads to 118 atoms in a supercell .",
    "the simulations of the stm images at large distances require a big lateral unit cell in the case of a single molecule on a surface .",
    "for that purpose , we enlarge our cell to @xmath50 silver atoms per layer , resulting in a @xmath51 hamilton matrix .",
    "special @xmath47 points on a @xmath52 mesh according to monkhorst and pack@xcite are used for the evaluation of the @xmath47 sums during the self - consistent cycle and for the computation of the stm and sts images .      for fcc",
    "bulk silver we calculate a lattice constant ( and bulk modulus ) of @xmath53  ( @xmath54 ) in lda and @xmath55  ( @xmath56 ) in gga . comparing these results to the experimental values of @xmath57  (",
    "@xmath58)@xcite it is obvious that lda gives reasonable results whereas gga overestimates the lattice constant distinctly .",
    "similar deviations have been observed by other authors @xcite for this material . for the clean surface",
    "we observe an inward relaxation of the topmost layer by @xmath3% in lda and @xmath59% in gga , respectively .",
    "these values are slightly smaller than the results of other theoretical calculations ( @xmath60  @xmath61% ) and comparable with experimental data ( @xmath62%).@xcite    tcne is a small organic molecule consisting of a central ethylene double bond surrounded by four cyano groups . for the isolated neutral molecule in the gas phase we find bond lengths of @xmath63 , @xmath64  and @xmath65  in lda and @xmath66 , @xmath67  and @xmath68  in gga .",
    "all lengths differ less than @xmath69  from the experimental ones.@xcite we observe in lda as well as in gga angles of @xmath70 between the ethylene bond and the cyano group and of @xmath71 within each cyano group",

    "both exchange - correlation functionals ( lda and gga ) give reliable results for the isolated tcne molecule .",
    "bulk silver , however , is much better described within lda .",
    "therefore , we employ the local density approximation for the investigation of the combined system of tcne on ag(001 ) .          we carry out structural optimization for tcne on ag(001 ) employing various start geometries which are shown in figure  [ fig : pos ] .",
    "the configuration of an adsorbed molecule can be characterized by the position of the double bond between the central carbon atoms and by the angle of orientation .",

    "a further measure of the bending of the molecule is the intramolecular vertical distortion @xmath81 , i.e. the height difference between the central carbon atoms and the nitrogen atoms .",

    "the bonds between the central c atoms , as well as the bonds are weakened in the adsorbed state .",
    "this can be attributed to the adsorption - induced occupation of the tcne lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , which is an antibonding orbital located at the two central c atoms and the four n atoms of tcne .",

    "nearly the same values are obtained for the other investigated adsorption structures .        to take a further look inside this process we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_chgdiff ] the charge density difference between the adsorbate system and its isolated parts .",
    "a reduction of the electron density underneath the molecule and a large increase of the density near the central carbon atoms is visible .",
    "the spatially localized increase of the density is given by the population of the lumo of the tcne molecule , while the decrease of the density occurs in a more extended region of the ag surface , mostly about 1  above the surface - atom nuclei .",
    "only a small density change takes place inside the substrate .",
    "it is worth to notice that the use of the additional orbitals ( see sec .",
    "[ ss : wavefunction ] ) is mandatory for a reliable description of the charge redistribution in this system .",
    "figure  [ fig:1_ldos ] shows the density of states ( dos ) for tcne on ag(001 ) in the optimal configuration a , calculated with a broadening of @xmath85ev .",
    "the local density of states of the adsorbed tcne molecule as resulting from a mulliken analysis@xcite of the wave function is given by the dashed red line .",
    "for comparison we have indicated the energy levels of neutral gas - phase tcne , as well as of negatively charged gas - phase tcne@xmath83 .",
    "the energetic levels of both gas - phase molecules have been aligned in such a way that the states below @xmath86ev fit best , because the smallest adsorption induced changes are expected in this region . at energies below @xmath86ev the dos coincides with the ldos and reflects the energetic positions of the molecular levels of tcne@xmath83 .",
    "we note in passing that the energy levels of tcne@xmath87 ( not shown here ) have positions similar to those of tcne@xmath83 . between @xmath86 and @xmath88ev",
    "there is a strong contribution of the ag d orbitals to the dos . at higher energies ,",
    "the dos is dominated by ag sp states .",
    "in addition to the numerical broadening of @xmath85ev , we observe for energies above @xmath86ev a broadening of the molecular levels due to the interaction with the substrate .",
    "the positions of the lumo of gas - phase tcne and of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of gas - phase tcne@xmath83 agree well with the position of the tcne : ag(001 ) ldos peak at @xmath89ev .",
    "the ldos corroborates that tcne adsorbed on ag(001 ) shows close electronic resemblance with a gas - phase charged tcne@xmath83 molecule , in addition to the close structural resemblance mentioned above .    as described above ,",
    "we find a charge transfer of @xmath60e but an occupation of nearly two electron in the former lumo .",
    "this indicates a charge transfer of @xmath90 electrons from various interacting orbitals of tcne back to the substrate , which is known as back donation .",
    "an enlarged section of the calculated electronic spectrum around the fermi level is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_ldos ] .",
    "the two peaks in the ldos of tcne at @xmath91ev and @xmath89ev correspond to the homo and lumo of tcne , respectively .",

    "show a clear peak at @xmath3v which was assigned to the lumo of tcne on the basis of a calculation for the gas - phase molecule . our results for tcne on ag(001 )",
    "corroborate this interpretation of the sts data .    .",
    "]    to set the stage for a discussion of the sts images of tcne on ag(001 ) we first have a look at the charge densities of the homo and lumo of an isolated tcne molecule that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcne_rho2d ] .",
    "we note that the pictured isosurfaces are very close to those for the homo-1 and homo of gas - phase tcne@xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the homo of tcne is a @xmath92-bonding state with maximum density at the central carbon atoms .",
    "in contrast to this , the lumo shows a nodal plane at the center of the c = c bond , which is the characteristic of an anti - bonding @xmath93 orbital .",
    "occupation of this orbital weakens the c = c bond leading to a bond length of @xmath94  at tcne@xmath83 in comparison to @xmath95  at neutral tcne . for both states ,",
    "about half of the electron density is located at the four nitrogen atoms . in the optimal adsorption position for tcne on ag(001 ) the molecule is oriented in such a way that the n atoms come close to the substrate .",
    "occupation of the @xmath93 orbital is accompanied by a charge transfer from the substrate to the molecule as described above .",
    "we have also calculated the ldos for the other investigated structures .",
    "the general features look similar but the peak positions are shifted towards higher energies . in particular , the lumo derived state is at @xmath96ev for configurations b , c and d and at @xmath97ev for e and f. summarizing , we find the best agreement between the peak at @xmath3v in the experimental d@xmath4/d@xmath5 curves and the calculated ldos for configuration a , which is also the energetically most favorable structure .      in experiment , topographical stm images provide information about the structure of adsorbates and surfaces combined with the electronic properties .",
    "interestingly , stm images measured in ref .   at a voltage of @xmath3v show that the adsorbed tcne molecule is surrounded by a trench . in the trench",
    "the tip is @xmath98 - @xmath99  closer to the surface than on clean ag(001 ) .",
    "calculated stm images based on a direct evaluation of the wave function do not show these details ( see left panel of fig .  [ fig:1_stm_comp ] ) . in the following",
    "we show that the refined treatment of the wave function outside the crystal as outlined in sec .",
    "[ ss : wavefunction ] gives stm images with a trench in good agreement with experiment .",
    "all calculated stm and sts images presented here are evaluated for a density ( i.e. right - hand side of eq .",

    "no additional orbitals above the surface ( cf .",

    "the tip is at a height of @xmath103 - @xmath104  above the surface for the desired density of 10@xmath100 . at this distance ,",
    "the stm image is dominated by the contributions from the tcne molecule due to the strong decay of gaussian orbitals , and the resulting image resembles that of the lumo at tcne . in the next step ,",
    "we extrapolate the wave function , starting from a reference plane at @xmath105  as outlined in sec .",

    "most interestingly , the image does show a trench around the molecule , i.e. the tip resides closer to the surface than on the clean silver substrate .",

    ", the trench nearly vanishes at the positions of the cyano groups ( line iii ) . in experiment ,",
    "the trench is also significantly smaller along line iii than along line i for most of the investigated samples .",
    "the nodal line of the @xmath93 orbital is still visible in the calculated image ( line i and iii ) while it is probably smeared in experiment due to a larger distance of the tip ( see the discussion of fig .",

    "these movements are distinctly smaller than the distance of @xmath123  between the adsorbed tcne molecule and the substrate .    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_stm - side ] also shows a spatial widening of the molecular states as the tip moves up . for @xmath120 ,",
    "e.g. , the two maxima of the constant - current line are @xmath124  apart from each other .",
    "this corresponds to the distance of @xmath125  between the two main lobes of the tcne lumo as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcne_rho2d ] ( right panel ) . on the other hand , for @xmath126 ( which is reached when",
    "the tip has moved up by about @xmath40 ) , the distance between the two maxima has increased to @xmath127 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the lateral appearance of molecular features in stm images is height - dependent .",
    "atomic orbitals tend to `` move outwards '' and may no longer be observed directly above the atoms from which they originate .",
    "we will come back to this issue when discussing the sts image .",
    "+ interestingly , the corrugation shows two maxima for densities @xmath128 larger than @xmath129 ( approximately 12  above the surface ) while only _",
    "one _ maximum is present above the center of the molecule for smaller densities ( i.e. at larger tip height ) .",
    "in contrast to the measured stm image ( right panel of fig .  [ fig:1_stm ] ) , in our calculation also the trench disappears at large tip height .",
    "we suppose that the evaluation of the images at such large distances would require a larger lateral unit cell .",
    "the other investigated adsorption configurations ( ) show very similar stm images for @xmath130ev .",
    "this is not surprising since the electronic structure in the energy interval from @xmath101ev to @xmath117 is characterized for all configurations ( ) by a state that resembles the lumo of tcne .",
    "a calculated stm image for unoccupied states up to @xmath113ev above @xmath117 also shows a faint trench around the tcne molecule .",
    "however , the distance between the bottom of the trench and the top of the molecule in this image is considerably larger than in the measured one.@xcite    ev ( upper left panel ) and @xmath89ev ( upper right panel ) ( calculated with spatial extrapolation and spectral broadening of @xmath98ev ) .",
    "the height is given in  .",
    "the empty circles denote the position of the atoms of tcne .",
    "an experimental d@xmath4/d@xmath5 map at @xmath3v is shown in the lower panel .",
    "the indicated positions of the atoms in the lower panel are inferred from a comparison with the theoretical results . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:1_sts ] presents calculated sts images for energies of @xmath91ev and @xmath89ev , respectively , which correspond to the peak positions in the ldos of tcne as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_ldos ] .",
    "the sts image at @xmath131ev with a main maximum at the bond and local maxima at the four n atoms strongly resembles the charge density of the homo of tcne . on the other hand ,",
    "the image at @xmath132ev is closely related to the charge density of the lumo . comparing the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_sts ] with the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tcne_rho2d ] we see that the region of maximal values for tcne on ag(001 ) is more extended than the atomic - orbital pattern closer to the atoms ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcne_rho2d ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , the positions of the local maxima at the n atoms are shifted outwards .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the general trend that molecular features appear laterally enlarged when probed at larger height , as was already discussed for fig .",
    "[ fig:1_stm - side ] .",
    "we note that in the present case of tcne , this trend is further supported by the distortion of the molecule .",
    "the tilting of the c - n bonds by @xmath133 ( relative to the flat gas - phase molecule ) causes a corresponding outward - tilting of the nitrogen p@xmath134 orbitals ( relative to the surface normal ) . as a consequence , their contribution to the stm and sts images tends to move outwards , as we observe in corresponding test calculations of flat and bent gas - phase molecules .",
    "the calculated sts image at @xmath132ev shows the same characteristic as the experimental d@xmath4/d@xmath5 map measured for this system at @xmath135v ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_sts ] ) : an oval body intersected by a central line node and surrounded by four lobes .",
    "also in experiment , the lobes are not centered at the positions of the n atoms but they are further away from the molecule . in summary , there is a nice agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "all theoretical results presented above have been evaluated for a tip with s symmetry . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ ss : calcstm ] , tip orbitals with different symmetry , e.g. p@xmath134 or d@xmath136 , can be simulated by a corresponding operator @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] , [ eq : sts ] ) ( see ref .   for further discussion ) . for the present adsorbate system , however , our investigations show that tips with p@xmath134 or d@xmath136 symmetry give qualitatively very similar stm and sts images .",
    "in summary , we have used density - functional theory to investigate the structural and electronic properties of tcne on the silver ( 001 ) surface in the limit of low coverage . our results support the structural model of ref .   proposed on the basis of stm and sts measurements . in the energetically most favorable structure ,",
    "the c = c bond of tcne is located above a silver atom and the four cyano groups are bound to four neighboring silver surface atoms .",
    "the bonding is accompanied by a transfer of about @xmath137 electrons from the substrate to the molecule due to occupation of the lumo of tcne .",
    "this gives rise to a peak at @xmath138ev in the ldos of the adsorption system in good agreement with a peak at @xmath135v in the experimental d@xmath4/d@xmath5 curves .",
    "our results show that tcne adsorbed on ag(001 ) is in close structural and electronic resemblance with a gas - phase charged tcne@xmath83 molecule . employing a spatial extrapolation of the wave function into the vacuum region we observe a faint trench in the calculated stm image at @xmath139ev in good agreement with the experimental results , especially with those obtained from a molecule - terminated tip .",
