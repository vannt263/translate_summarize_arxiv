    "vector mesons ( @xmath5 ) , such as @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are of special interest for dilepton @xmath9 spectroscopy in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite since they couple as @xmath10 states to photons @xmath11 and allow to seek for medium modifications via their spectral functions ( cf .",

    ", the sw model has to be extended to accommodate non - zero temperature effects .",
    "this has been accomplished , e.g. in @xcite , with the finding of the disappearance of vector mesons at a temperature scale significantly below @xmath2 ( cf .",

    "even an extension to finite baryon density effects is possible @xcite .",
    "the construction in @xcite is tightly related to the hawking - page phase transition , implying a first - order phase transition at @xmath2 , where at temperatures @xmath1 below @xmath2 the thermal gas solution applies , i.e.  the hadron states are as at @xmath4 . + it is the aim of the present paper to report on the thermodynamics which is encoded in our extension of the sw model in relation with qcd thermodynamics and the option of tuning the holographic model such to have vector meson states only at @xmath3 .",
    "the picture we have in mind is as follows . at @xmath13 ,",
    "no hadron states exist . at @xmath2 ( or in a narrow corridor centered at @xmath2 ) , hadron states appear and persist toward smaller temperatures .",
    "in other words , considering an expanding and therefore cooling piece of strongly interacting matter in the course of a relativistic heavy - ion collision , hadronization happens at @xmath2 .",
    "guided by the success of the thermo - statistical model @xcite , we argue that the emerging hadron states are statistically distributed according to maximum entropy . in line with arguments in @xcite ,",
    "the inelastic hadron reaction rates drop extremely rapidly upon further cooling , i.e.  the chemical composition freezes out ( f.o . ) at @xmath14 .",
    "( for a more differential analysis within transport models , cf . @xcite . ) + altogether , we provide a holographic model in the spirit of the sw model with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the temperature at which hadron states appear upon cooling ( or disappear when heating a piece of strongly interacting matter ) . at the same time , an approximately linear regge trajectory with proper @xmath0 ground state at @xmath4 is used as input for the qcd - hadron scale setting . for the thermodynamic scale",

    "<S> the soft wall model is extended to accommodate at the same time ( i ) approximately linear @xmath0 meson regge trajectories at zero temperature @xmath1 , ( ii ) various options for the thermodynamics with reference to qcd ( cross over or second - order transition or first - order transition at @xmath2 ) , and ( iii ) the appearance of vector meson states at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> while the vector meson masses display some modest model dependence very near to @xmath2 , they stay below @xmath2 to good accuracy independent of the temperature , that is nearly as at @xmath4 , thus being very consistent with the thermo - statistical models widely employed in analyses of the hadron yields in relativistic heavy - ion collisions in a region where baryon densitiy effects can be neglected and the vacuum hadron masses are used . </S>"
