    "it is considered here that type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) resulting from evolution of massive stars are the major sources for the @xmath0-process ( e.g. , qian 2000 ) . as",
    "massive stars have much shorter lifetimes than low - mass stars , sne ii made the dominant contributions to the abundances of @xmath3-capture elements in metal - poor ( mp ) stars that were formed in the early galaxy .",

    "this letter discusses the implications of these abundance patterns for @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in sne ii .    starting with a large abundance ratio of neutrons relative to the seed nuclei ( i.e. , a large neutron - to - seed ratio ) , the @xmath0-process produces a distribution of neutron - rich progenitor nuclei far from stability through the interplay of rapid neutron capture , photo - disintegration , and @xmath6-decay . depending on the neutron - to - seed ratio",
    ", the @xmath0-process may produce progenitor nuclei that subsequently undergo fission on a short timescale .",
    "this limits the range of nuclei involved in the @xmath0-process and may result in a cyclic flow between the terminating nuclei and their fission products ( i.e. , fission cycling ) .",
    "the role of fission in @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis was discussed by the very first papers that proposed the @xmath0-process ( burbidge et al .",
    "1957 ; cameron 1957 ) .",
    "fission cycling was discussed in detail by seeger fowler , & clayton ( 1965 ) and was included in many @xmath0-process studies ( e.g. , rauscher et al .",
    "1994 ; freiburghaus , rosswog , & thielemann 1999 ; cameron 2001 ) .",
    "fission was also invoked to explain certain features of the observed @xmath0-process abundance patterns ( @xmath0-patterns ) .",
    "for example , cameron ( 1957 ) attributed the small peak in the rare earth region ( with mass numbers @xmath7 ) of the solar @xmath0-pattern to fission of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath8 .",
    "an @xmath0-process scenario with fission but no fission cycling is considered here to account for the observed abundance patterns in ump stars (  2 ) .",
    "it is proposed that fission may be induced by neutrino reactions with the progenitor nuclei after the @xmath0-process freezes out ( i.e. , exhausts all the initial neutrons ) in sne ii .",
    "the conditions under which this scenario could be realized and some possible features of the resulting @xmath0-pattern are discussed (  3 ) .",
    "further studies to develop this scenario are emphasized (  4 ) .",
    "extensive observations showed that the abundances of the heavy @xmath3-capture elements from ba up to pt in ump stars exhibit remarkable regularity and follow the solar @xmath0-pattern rather closely ( e.g. , sneden et al . 2000 ; westin et al .",
    "however , as shown in figure 1a , the observed abundances of the light @xmath3-capture elements rh , pd , ag , and cd in the ump star cs 22892 - 052 ( sneden et al . 2000 ) are too low relative to the solar @xmath0-pattern ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) that is translated to fit the region above ba ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that different production mechanisms may be responsible for the @xmath3-capture elements below and above ba in ump stars .",
    "for example , fission cycling tends to produce a rather robust @xmath0-pattern at @xmath10 ( e.g. , freiburghaus et al .",
    "so the regular abundance pattern for ba and above in ump stars could be attributed to an @xmath0-process with a neutron - to - seed ratio that is sufficiently high for fission cycling to occur",
    ". then the light @xmath3-capture elements in ump stars could be attributed to some other @xmath0-process with a neutron - to - seed ratio that is appropriate for producing these elements only or to the weak @xmath2-process that might operate at some unusually high efficiency in the earliest generations of massive stars .",
    "however , the attribution of the abundances of ba and above in ump stars to an @xmath0-process with fission cycling may be in conflict with the data on another ump star cs 31082 - 001 . as can be seen from figure 1b , the observed abundances in cs 31082 - 001 ( cayrel et al . 2001 ; hill et al .",
    "2001 ) and cs 22892 - 052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2001 ) follow approximately the same pattern except that the differences in the abundances of os and the radioactive elements th and u between the two stars appear to be significantly larger than those for the other elements ( the differences in the abundances of ir and pb may also be significant but the uncertainties are large ) . as can be best seen by considering the abundance ratio th / eu , the data on cs 31082 - 001 and cs 22892 - 052 do not support a robust @xmath0-pattern at @xmath10 that is expected from fission cycling . in view of the extremely low [ fe / h ] values of @xmath5 for the two stars ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that both stars were formed during the first few gyr after the onset of galactic @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "so both stars should have ages of @xmath11 gyr .",
    "under the assumption of a fixed @xmath0-process yield ratio of th relative to eu , the difference @xmath12 in the ages of the two stars is @xmath13 where @xmath14 gyr is the lifetime of @xmath15th .",
    "the data @xmath16 , @xmath17 for cs 31082 - 001 ( cayrel et al .",
    "2001 ; hill et al .",
    "2001 ) and @xmath18 , @xmath19 for cs 22892 - 052 ( sneden et al . 2001 ) , where @xmath20 , give @xmath21 gyr .",
    "this is totally unreasonable .",
    "thus , the assumption of a fixed @xmath0-process yield ratio of th relative to eu must be invalid and the @xmath0-pattern at @xmath10 is not robust .    while it may be possible to accommodate the data on both cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 by having variable amounts of fission cycling in the @xmath0-process , an alternative scenario with fission but no fission cycling",
    "is considered here to explain the observed abundance patterns of @xmath3-capture elements in these two and possibly other ump stars .",
    "it is proposed that an @xmath0-process produces a freeze - out distribution of progenitor nuclei covering @xmath22 with a peak at @xmath23 ( corresponding to the magic neutron number @xmath24 ) .",
    "the required neutron - to - seed ratio is high , but it is assumed that no fission cycling occurs during the @xmath0-process .",
    "this may be consistent with some recent studies of fission barriers for extremely neutron - rich nuclei ( mamdouh et al .",
    "2001 ) . as the progenitor nuclei @xmath6-decay towards stability after freeze - out ,",
    "all of those with @xmath25 eventually undergo spontaneous fission ( e.g. , cameron 2001 ) . due to the strong influence of the closed proton and neutron shells at @xmath26sn ,",
    "the fission of @xmath25 is expected to produce one fragment at @xmath27 and the other at @xmath28 although the detailed fission yields may be more complicated ( e.g. , hulet et al .",
    ". some of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath29 would also undergo spontaneous fission during decay towards stability , thereby producing one fragment again at @xmath27 and the other at @xmath30 .",
    "the possibility of fission for @xmath29 may be greatly enhanced by reactions with the neutrinos emitted in sne ii as these nuclei could be highly excited by such reactions .",
    "neutrino reactions may even induce fission of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath31 .",
    "experiments using energetic particles to induce fission of the stable or long - lived nuclei in this mass range showed that the fission mode is dominantly symmetric with no preference for a fission fragment at @xmath27 and the mass ratio of the two fission fragments is @xmath321.2 ( e.g. , britt et al .",
    "1963 ; see mller et al .",
    "2001 for recent theoretical interpretation ) .",
    "so the neutrino - induced fission of @xmath31 is expected to produce fragments at @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath0-process scenario proposed here , the fission of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath22 during decay towards stability after freeze - out would produce nuclei with @xmath34 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in view of the mass range of the progenitor nuclei and their fission products , it is tempting to consider the proposed @xmath0-process scenario as the dominant source for all the @xmath3-capture elements observed in ump stars .",
    "the ratio of the fission yields at @xmath34 relative to the surviving abundances at @xmath35 depends on the number of neutrino reactions experienced by each progenitor nucleus after freeze - out .",
    "variation of this number among individual sne ii may explain why the observed abundances of os and above ( @xmath36 ) relative to those of the @xmath3-capture elements below os are significantly different in cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 .",
    "the conditions under which the proposed scenario could be realized are discussed below .",
    "in the @xmath0-process scenario proposed here , all the initial neutrons are exhausted when the heaviest progenitor nuclei with @xmath37 are produced . except for the progenitor nuclei perhaps with @xmath38 that are mostly produced when the @xmath0-process is running out of neutrons , the freeze - out abundances of the other progenitor nuclei are expected to be inversely proportional to their @xmath6-decay rates .",
    "the @xmath6-decay rates for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath39 ( @xmath24 ) are @xmath11 times smaller than those for @xmath40 ( mller et al .",
    "1997 ) . with this crude guidance to the freeze - out abundances ( see table 1 ) ,",
    "the ratio of the fission yields at @xmath34 relative to the surviving abundances at @xmath35 is @xmath41 if a fraction @xmath42 of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 and all of those with @xmath25 undergo fission during decay towards stability after freeze - out . by assigning the @xmath3-capture elements below os to the fission products and considering pb as the dominant decay product of the surviving nuclei with @xmath43",
    ", it can be estimated from figure 1 that @xmath44 is required to account for the gross features of the observed abundance pattern in cs 22892 - 052 and @xmath45 for cs 31082 - 001 .    without excitation by energetic particles ,",
    "the probability of fission increases with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the atomic number of the nucleus .",
    "all of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath25 are expected to undergo spontaneous fission eventually as @xmath47 increases during their decay towards stability ( e.g. , cameron 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , as the stable or long - lived nuclei with @xmath31 do not undergo any significant spontaneous fission , neither would their neutron - rich progenitors in the absence of high excitation",
    ". the probability of spontaneous fission during decay towards stability may not be significant even for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath29 ( e.g. , meyer et al . 1989 ) .",
    "however , the progenitor nuclei and their daughters can be highly excited by reactions with the neutrinos emitted in sne ii .",
    "the typical excitation energy is @xmath48 mev for @xmath49 capture and @xmath50 mev for reactions with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( e.g. , qian et al .",
    "thus , neutrino reactions may be crucial in inducing the fission of @xmath5540% of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 during decay towards stability after freeze - out .",
    "note that neutrino - induced fission should be unimportant during the @xmath0-process as the rates for @xmath49 capture must be severely limited in order to produce the abundance peak at @xmath23 ( fuller & meyer 1995 ) .",
    "an essential question is then whether there would be a sufficient number of neutrino reactions with the progenitor nuclei after the @xmath0-process freezes out in sne ii .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of the neutron star formed in sne ii is radiated in neutrinos over a period of @xmath55 s ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "this is the upper limit on the duration of the @xmath0-process so that the progenitor nuclei can have a significant number of neutrino reactions after freeze - out .",
    "the duration of the @xmath0-process is dominantly controlled by the @xmath6-decay lifetimes of the progenitor nuclei . for an @xmath0-process path in a low - density environment where electrons are nondegenerate , the typical @xmath6-decay lifetimes are @xmath56 s for @xmath11 progenitor nuclei with closed neutron shells and @xmath57 s for those without ( mller et al .",
    "it would then take @xmath58 s to reach the progenitor nuclei with @xmath37 .",
    "so all the progenitor nuclei could have a significant number of neutrino reactions after freeze - out if the @xmath0-process scenario proposed here is restricted to occur in a low - density environment such as the neutrino - driven wind from the neutron star ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1994 ) instead of a high - density environment such as an accretion disk ( cameron 2001 ) .",
    "another concern is the probability of fission following a neutrino reaction .",
    "a neutron - rich nucleus far from stability can de - excite by emitting neutrons instead of undergoing fission .",
    "increase in @xmath47 would help neutrino - induced fission compete with neutron emission .",
    "based on the @xmath6-decay lifetimes estimated by mller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath47 could increase by @xmath59 units within @xmath11 s for the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the crucial role of neutrino - induced fission in the @xmath0-process scenario proposed here relies on the assumption that the probability of fission following a neutrino reaction is or becomes significant during the first @xmath59 steps in the @xmath6-decay chains of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 .",
    "this assumption should be checked by detailed calculations in the future .",
    "if a typical probability of fission is @xmath60 ( i.e. , comparable to that of neutron emission ) , a fraction @xmath61\\sim 20$]40% of the progenitor nuclei would undergo fission after a total number @xmath621.6 of neutrino reactions per nucleus .",
    "the values of @xmath63 to give @xmath6440% may be reduced somewhat by increasing @xmath3 to @xmath65 .",
    "a similar level of neutrino reactions would completely account for the production of @xmath66187 by neutrino - induced neutron emission from the progenitor nuclei in the peak at @xmath23 after freeze - out ( qian et al .",
    "1997 ; haxton et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "given that the proposed @xmath0-process scenario with fission could be realized , it is interesting to note some features of the corresponding yield pattern that are not so evident from the data for cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 .",
    "as proposed , the freeze - out distribution of progenitor nuclei covers @xmath22 with a peak at @xmath23 .",
    "the fission of @xmath5540% of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath35 and all of those with @xmath25 would produce enhanced fission yields at @xmath67 and @xmath27 .",
    "the enhancement at @xmath67 is expected from fission of the progenitor nuclei in the peak at @xmath23 , while that at @xmath27 from the common fission fragment at this position for all the progenitor nuclei with @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the typical yield pattern from the proposed @xmath0-process scenario has a peak at @xmath23 and enhanced yields at @xmath67 and @xmath27 .",
    "this yield pattern could be modified by capturing the neutrons released from fission .",
    "for example , the positions of the peak and the enhanced fission yields could be shifted to somewhat higher @xmath69 .",
    "such shifts in the yield pattern due to residual neutron capture were found in @xmath0-process scenarios with fission cycling ( rauscher et al .",
    "1994 ; freiburghaus et al .",
    "1999 ) . in any case",
    ", the @xmath0-process scenario proposed here could not account for the peak at @xmath70 in the solar @xmath0-pattern and therefore could provide one of the diverse sources for the @xmath0-process that are required by the model of wasserburg , busso , & gallino ( 1996 ) to explain the meteoritic data on @xmath71i and @xmath72hf .",
    "the yield pattern resulting from this scenario might also be similar to the @xmath0-pattern that was derived by qian & wasserburg ( 2001 ) for the high - frequency kind of sne ii based on the model of wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and observations of mp stars",
    ".    there may be a hint for the shift of the enhanced fission yields at @xmath27 to higher @xmath69 from studies of the ba isotopic composition in the ump star hd 140283 .",
    "the three @xmath0-process isotopes of ba are @xmath73ba , @xmath74ba , and @xmath75ba .",
    "the odd-@xmath69 isotopes of an element have finite nuclear magnetic moments that lead to hyperfine structure of the atomic spectra .",
    "magain ( 1995 ) performed a detailed analysis of the ba spectra for hd 140283 and concluded that the fraction of the odd-@xmath69 ba isotopes is @xmath76 , corresponding to abundance ratios @xmath75ba/@xmath73ba and @xmath75ba/@xmath74ba of @xmath77 . by capturing the neutrons released from fission ,",
    "the enhanced fission yields at @xmath27 could be shifted to produce this steep rise of the yield at @xmath78 .",
    "it is also possible that the ba in hd 140283 may not be of pure @xmath0-process origin . in any case , the ba isotopic composition in ump stars has important implications for @xmath3-capture processes in the early galaxy and deserves further observational studies .",
    "clearly , much further work is required to develop the @xmath0-process scenario with fission as proposed here . on the observational side , extensive studies of the abundance patterns of @xmath3-capture elements",
    "should be carried out for many more ump stars to identify regularities and variations .",
    "the paucity of data on the light @xmath3-capture elements below ba should be remedied . as pb is the dominant decay product of the progenitor nuclei with @xmath43 , accurate determination of its abundance should be made .",
    "detailed analyses of ba isotopes are also valuable as discussed in  3 . on the theoretical side , the foremost issue to investigate is the probability of neutrino - induced fission for extremely neutron - rich nuclei and the corresponding fission yields .",
    "numerical calculations with an extensive network including neutrino reactions are needed to make a detailed comparison between the theoretical yields and the observed abundance patterns .",
    "the effects of the energy release from fission on the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic evolution of the @xmath0-process environment are also interesting to study .",
    "last but certainly not the least , attempts should be made to understand how the conditions for the proposed @xmath0-process scenario are realized in a low - density environment such as the neutrino - driven wind in sne ii .",
    "a crucial quantity characterizing the @xmath0-process conditions is the neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath79 . by mass conservation , the average mass number @xmath80 for the freeze - out distribution of progenitor nuclei is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the mass number of the seed nuclei . with @xmath83",
    "obtained in the neutrino - driven wind ( e.g. , woolsey et al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath84 is required to produce @xmath85 in the proposed @xmath0-process scenario ( see table 1 ) .",
    "in general , @xmath79 is determined by the electron fraction @xmath86 , the entropy @xmath87 , and the dynamic timescale @xmath88 of the wind . while it remains unclear how the suitable combinations of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 can be obtained in the wind to give @xmath84 , several possibilities have been suggested .",
    "one is to consider the general relativistic effects of a more massive or compact neutron star . as first shown by qian & woosley ( 1996 ) and",
    "later confirmed by other studies ( cardall & fuller 1997 ; otsuki et al .",
    "2000 ; thompson , burrows , & meyer 2001 ) , such effects increase @xmath87 and decrease @xmath88 , both favoring higher @xmath79 .",
    "another possibility is to consider the effects of neutrino flavor mixing .",
    "the @xmath86 in the wind is mostly determined by the competition between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and therefore is extremely sensitive to the differences between the luminosities and energy spectra of @xmath91 and @xmath49 ( qian et al .",
    "1993 ) . as @xmath52 and @xmath54",
    "have much higher average energy than @xmath91 and @xmath49 , mixing between @xmath92 and @xmath91 could significantly reduce @xmath86 ( e.g. , qian & fuller 1995 ) , again favoring higher @xmath79 .",
    "it is plausible that by including both the effects of general relativity and neutrino flavor mixing , @xmath84 could be obtained in the wind .",
    "these issues should be examined by future studies .",
