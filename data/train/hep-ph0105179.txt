    "the predictions for the @xmath188 invariant mass distribution and the integrated @xmath4 width are sensitive enough to @xmath135 and @xmath136 to allow for interesting comparisons with experiment . the recently available data for @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ snd ] ) from the snd collaboration favour the presence of a low mass and moderately narrow @xmath6 meson .",
    "the parallel analysis of the @xmath189 decay is more involved because @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing plays a rle , as first analyzed by guetta and singer @xcite .",
    "moreover , for this decay the main contribution comes from a less well fixed vmd amplitude and the effects of scalar meson exchange are much more difficult to disentangle . in this case , there is little hope to learn on the values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 when comparing with experiment . the available data in eq .",
    "( [ gams ] ) are compatible with our predictions , although poorly conclusive because they are affected by large errors .    in summary , higher accuracy data for these two channels and more refined theoretical analyses would contribute decisively to clarify one of the challenging aspects of present hadron physics , namely , the structure of the lowest lying scalar states and particularly of the controversial @xmath6 meson .",
