    "this means that the distribution of @xmath143 is @xmath58-independent and that there is no difference in the disorder between the optimally doped samples of the different families .",
    "thus , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ main ] , disorder is not relevant to the variation of @xmath29 between the different families .",
    "this conclusion is supported by more rigorous analysis @xcite . @xmath143 and @xmath144 presented in fig .",
    "[ nqranalysis ] are obtained by fitting nqr line shape to this data as demonstrated by the solid lines .",
    "the penetration depth is measured with transverse field tf-@xmath18sr . in this experiment one",
    "follows the transverse muon polarization @xmath145 when a magnetic field is on and perpendicular to the initial polarization .",
    "these experiments are done by field cooling ( fc ) the sample to 1.8 k at an external field of 3 koe .",
    "every muon precesses according to the local field in its environment . when field cooling the sample , a vortex lattice is formed , and the field from these vortices decays on a length scale of the penetration depth @xmath146 .",
    "this leads to an inhomogeneous field distribution in the sample . since the magnetic length scale is much larger than the atomic one , the muons probe the magnetic field distribution randomly , which , in turn , leads to a damping of the muons average spin polarization",
    "this situation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ musrtfraw ] where we present @xmath145 in two different perpendicular directions ( called real and imaginary ) in a rotating reference frame . at temperatures above",
    "@xmath15 the field is homogeneous and all muons experience the same field , and therefore no relaxation is observed .",
    "well below @xmath7 ( of @xmath147  k in this case ) there are strong field variations and therefore different muons precess with different frequencies , and the average polarization quickly decays to zero . at intermediate temperatures",
    "the field variation are not severe and the relaxation is moderate .",
    "[ ptb ]    musrtfraw.eps    it was shown that in powder samples of htsc the muon polarization @xmath148 is well described by @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the precession frequency of the muon , and @xmath151 is the relaxation rate @xcite .",
    "the solid line in this figure is the fit result .",
    "the fact that the whole asymmetry relaxes indicates that clblco is a bulk superconductor .",
    "the fit results for @xmath151 are shown in fig .",
    "[ uemura ] . as can be seen",
    ", the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath151 is linear in the under - doped region and universal for all clblco families , as expected from the uemura relations .",
    "however , there is a new aspect in this plot .",
    "there is no `` boomerang '' effect , namely , overdoped and underdoped samples with equal @xmath7 have the same @xmath151 , with only slight deviations for the @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in clblco there is one to one correspondence between @xmath7 and @xmath151 , and therefore @xmath152 , over the whole doping range .",
    "neutron powder diffraction experiments were performed at the special environment powder diffractometer at argonne s intense pulsed neutron source ( see ref .  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure [ neutrons ] shows a summary of the lattice parameters .",
    "the empty symbols represent data taken from ref .",
    "all the parameters are family - dependent , but not to the same extent . the lattice parameters a and c , depicted in fig . [",
    "neutrons](a ) and ( b ) , change by up to about 0.5% between the two extreme families ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the in - plane cu - o - cu buckling angle is shown in fig .",
    "[ neutrons](c ) .",
    "this angle is non - zero since the oxygen is slightly out of the cu plane and closer to the y site of the ybco structure . as mentioned in sec .",
