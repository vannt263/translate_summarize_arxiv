    "complete theoretical description of relativistic particles requires understanding of their binding , which concerns how these particles form bound states and how their yet unidentified constituents might be bound , if any .",
    "the fact that potentially relevant binding mechanisms are still far from being understood is best illustrated by the current example of hadrons as built from quarks and gluons .",
    "hadronic structure continues to pose problems with physical interpretation of phenomena such as the spin of nucleons or apparent lack of gluonic excitations in the spectrum of light hadrons .",
    "phenomenology includes constituent quarks and gluons , partons in the infinite momentum frame , and field - theoretic concepts of qcd , but no unified understanding of the building blocks of hadrons is presently available .",
    "a verified non - relativistic method for describing bound states in quantum mechanics is provided by the schrdinger equation @xmath7 .",
    "however , one must extend the method to include at least symmetries of special relativity . in order to combine quantum mechanics and special relativity in hamiltonian dynamics , one needs to construct ten hermitian generators of the poincar algebra @xcite , i.e. four momenta @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and six operators @xmath10 that generate rotations and boosts .",

    "this phenomenon can be described using quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "but qft leads to the problem that when one attempts to calculate the poincar generators using local interactions and canonical quantization , one discovers ultraviolet divergences that have to be regulated .",
    "unfortunately , regularization of the generators destroys symmetries of the local theory and eqs .",
    "( [ pm]-[mm ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "this complication is considered by many authors an essential drawback of the canonical approach . however ,",
    "if some renormalization group procedure @xcite were able to remove the regularization dependent terms that violate poincar symmetry , the resulting quantum mechanical approach could become a candidate for the relativistic description of particle binding .",
    "the desired renormalization procedure should produce expressions for all poincar generators in terms of scale - dependent effective particles , instead of the bare point - like quanta .",
    "a candidate calculus for development of such effective particle scheme has been recently proposed @xcite in the case of hamiltonian operators , based on the idea of the similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonian matrices @xcite . the new calculus is already known to produce asymptotic freedom in the renormalized hamiltonians for effective gluons in qcd .",
    "present work extends the new method to all generators of the poincar algebra , using a simplest example of scalar particles to outline the scheme .",
    "dynamics of particles with spin 1/2 and 1 , especially in gauge theories , turn out to involve additional small-@xmath13 singularities that require extensive studies before conclusions can be drawn about applicability of the new method to gauge theories .",
    "the poincar generators that do not depend on interactions are relatively easy to construct in qft , since they are equal to the generators for free particles .",
    "they are called kinematical , since the transformations they generate correspond to symmetries of the space of kinematical variables that label states .",
    "the generators that involve interactions are called dynamical , for they generate transformations that involve evolution of states in time , which involves dynamics .",
    "the latter are much harder to construct in qft because the interaction terms one obtains from local theories involve divergences .",
    "it helps to note at this point that the number of the hard - to - construct dynamical generators depends on the form of dynamics .",
    "three qualitatively different forms exist @xcite : the well known equal - time formulation , the point form , and the front form , which is conventionally called here the light - front ( lf ) dynamics .",
    "these forms differ by a hyper - surface in space - time where the wave functions for a system under consideration would be defined .",
    "different surfaces induce different expressions for the generators of the poincar group in qft .    in the usual formulation ,",
    "a physical system is defined on the hyper - plane of equal time , e.g. @xmath14 , and the hyper - plane is invariant under six poincar transformations .",
    "noether s theorem implies that there are six kinematical generators , i.e. three momenta and three generators of rotations .",
    "the remaining four generators of translations in time and three lorentz boosts , all depend on the interactions , and they lead to the ultraviolet divergence problems . in the point form of dynamics , in which the system s evolution is traced from one space - like hyperboloid @xmath15 to another",
    ", one has six kinematical generators , @xmath16 , and four dynamical , @xmath8 .",
    "this form seems to have a natural relativity structure but it encounters difficulties in practice , since all momentum operators depend on interactions and momentum representation for quantum states is not easily available . in the lf dynamics , the system is defined on the hyper - plane described by equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a zero - vector , often chosen to have components @xmath19 so that the lf hyper - plane is given by the condition @xmath20 .",
    "there are _ seven _ kinematical generators in the lf approach : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the only dynamical generators are @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 has exclusively positive eigenvalues , denoted by @xmath29 , and the free single particle `` energy '' , @xmath30 , does not involve a square root .",
    "these features suggest that the construction of dynamical generators could be easier in the lf dynamics than in other approaches .",
    "quantum field theories formulated in the equal - time approach lead to hamiltonian terms that can create particles out of the bare vacuum , as long as the created particles three - momenta sum up to zero .",
    "these terms immediately lead to unknown ground state structures that are thought to be involved in formation of the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the corresponding expressions for effective poincar generators can hardly be found before the ground state and its excitations are understood . in the regularized lf dynamics , the bare vacuum state is an eigenstate of all generators with eigenvalue zero , since creation of particles with positive momenta @xmath29 would have to change the state momentum and translation invariance forbids that .",
    "the bare vacuum state can be then used in a perturbative approach to build effective particle states and study their interactions .",
    "these states and interactions may turn out to contain very complicated long - wavelength components that correspond to the vacuum effects in the standard approach , but the perturbative construction can start from the physically relevant non - vacuum parts .",
    "thus , the vacuum effects in lf dynamics are not expected to overwhelm the bound state problem from the beginning .",
    "an important argument for considering lf dynamics comes from the fact that the seventh kinematical generator , i.e. @xmath25 , appears to allow boosting of states to the infinite momentum frame .",
    "therefore , one may hope that the constituent structure of bound states in the rest frame of reference can be directly connected with the parton picture in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "a boost - invariant renormalization group procedure for effective particles in lf quantum field theory is therefore highly desired for description of high - energy collisions of particles , especially hadrons using qcd .",
    "this work is focused on the poincar algebra in lf dynamics with simplest interactions that produce ultraviolet divergences , scalar fields with a cubic interaction term .",
    "key elements of the perturbative renormalization group calculus for poincar algebra are related to the three - prong nature of the interactions .",
    "the same structure is encountered in all theories of physical interest .",
    "although the scalar theory is considered unstable , the construction of generators order by order in perturbation theory never runs into the need of considering the exact ground state .",
    "thus , the general renormalization group scheme can be studied perturbatively using scalar particles .",

    "effective_. they turn out to be free from the poincar symmetry violating cutoff effects in a perturbative theory in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "the reason , to be explained below , is that they do not directly couple effective particle states with small and large invariant masses .",
    "this feature is analogous but not identical to removal of large energy jumps in the original similarity renormalization group procedure @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the effective generators are able to produce larger jumps than the effective time - evolution generator itself .",

    "the required expression for @xmath73 is found from equations that determine renormalized hamiltonians @xmath74 .",
    "the initial regularized hamiltonian @xmath75 that includes unknown counterterms , is originally expressed in terms of bare operators @xmath72 .",
    "one assumes that @xmath72 and @xmath70 are connected by a unitary transformation that preserves quantum numbers labeling @xmath72 and @xmath70 , @xmath76 and one solves the renormalization group equations from appendix [ app2 ] to derive effective hamiltonians , i.e. @xmath74 expressed in terms of effective operators @xmath70 for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure provides @xmath77 and appendix [ app3 ] explains how .",
    "the effective hamiltonians @xmath74 contain vertex form factors @xmath78 in interaction terms ( @xmath4 is the width of the form factors in momentum space ) .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonians do not directly couple states of effective particles with invariant masses that differ by more than about @xmath4 and the interaction terms need to act at least about @xmath79 times to reach masses order @xmath47 starting from finite masses .",
    "thus , if the effective hamiltonian terms for finite momenta have a limit when @xmath80 , the resulting theory is free from the regularization dependence to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , the counterterms required in @xmath75 can be found from the condition that for finite relative momenta coefficients of products of @xmath70 in the operators @xmath74 are independent of @xmath47 when @xmath57 .",
    "similar condition is used for finding counterterms in all generators .",
    "once the function @xmath81 is found from equations for @xmath74 , see appendix [ app3 ] , all other poincar generators are expressed in terms of @xmath70 by a plain substitution .",
    "all divergences in the resulting expressions are identified and counterterms in the bare generators are introduced as required by the cancellation of the divergences in the generators expressed in terms of @xmath70 . in the scalar theory ,",
    "it turns out that only mass counterterms are required in terms of order @xmath6 .",
    "once the counterterms in the initial generators are found , one takes the limit @xmath82 in the expressions written in terms of @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting operators constitute the effective poincar algebra .",
    "the key point of the whole construction is that the finite scale @xmath4 in vertex form factors destroys the ability of @xmath83-th order poincar generators to change momenta of effective particles by more than @xmath84 and the limit @xmath80 is well defined in perturbation theory in the effective fock space basis .",
    "since the effective interactions are smoothed by the form factors of width @xmath4 , the time evolution in physical processes characterized by some momentum transfer scale @xmath85 is most naturally described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath86 .",
    "namely , using @xmath87 with @xmath88 , one would introduce many tiny details whose net effect could presumably be absorbed into renormalization of effective interaction parameters , as in the case of logarithms of the ratio @xmath89 that contribute to the running coupling constant .",
    "on the other hand , using @xmath90 , one would have to unnecessarily consider multiple effective interactions to build momentum transfers on the order of @xmath85 through about @xmath91 small steps , each transferring at most about @xmath4 . to work with the effective particles with @xmath92 and to have control on transformation properties of physical states ,",
    "it is desirable to have all generators written in terms of @xmath93 .",
    "mathematically , any bare generator with added counterterms , @xmath94 , is expressed in terms of effective creation and annihilation operators using formula    @xmath95 =   \\tilde{a}_\\lambda(q_\\lambda ) \\ ; . \\label{atilde}\\ ] ]    the symbol  @xmath96   is used to indicate that the regularization cutoff parameter @xmath47 is still kept finite at this stage of the calculation . however , once the counterterms @xmath97 are found and the effective generators calculated , one can take the limit @xmath57 by putting @xmath98 in the effective generators .",
    "thus , the effective generators are given by the formula @xmath99 results obtained from this formula are described below .",
    "although operators @xmath72 expressed in terms of @xmath70 contain terms of order 1 , @xmath0 , @xmath6 and higher , all seven effective kinematical generators appear unchanged in form , as if they continued to be independent of interactions .",
    "namely , the only change that occurs in them is that the bare creation and annihilation operators are transformed into the operators for effective particles of scale @xmath4 .",
    "the coefficients are not changed and they remain equal to the coefficients found in the interacting canonical theory as well as in the free theory .",
    "this result follows from kinematical symmetries of lf dynamics , which are preserved in the renormalization group equations .    on the other hand , the interaction terms in the dynamical generators",
    "are changed considerably and contain products of form factors @xmath78 that limit momentum transfers by @xmath4 or @xmath100 .",
    "the factor of two results from a convolution of two first order terms , each containing @xmath78 .",
    "the appearance of form factors in this pattern is verified here only in terms of order @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of these two cases and observed regularities that appear along with derivatives over particle momenta in the generators of rotations , one is compelled to consider it plausible , though not proved yet , that in higher orders , say @xmath83-th , the form factors will appear following the same pattern and limit momentum transfers by @xmath101 .",
    "this explains why the generators of rotations can produce jumps larger than the jumps allowed by @xmath74 itself .    in the interaction terms order @xmath0 ,",

    "the amplitudes that involve perturbative renormalization group effects are of order @xmath119 , and higher . therefore , the results obtained in previous sections for terms order 1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath6 , must be extended up to the fourth order terms to study symmetries of the scattering matrix calculated in the effective theory and to verify applicability of the constructed interacting algebra to gedanken physical processes with scalar particles .",
    "however , even in the second order analysis there exists a test that the effective algebra has to pass independently of the higher order terms .",
