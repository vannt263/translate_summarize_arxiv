    "ngc 5128 is the king galaxy of the southern hemisphere , if sovereignty is judged by the number of studies devoted .",
    "it is no wonder that this is the case since centaurus a , or cen a , as it is commonly referred to , is the fifth brightest galaxy in the sky ( rc2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) usually classified as an e0p or s0p .",
    "it hosts a powerful x - ray and radio jets @xcite and a low - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "cen a suffered a recent major merger that shaped its present appearance , leaving shells at large radii @xcite and a conspicuous polar dust lane in the centre @xcite , consistent with being a thin warped disk @xcite .",
    "it is , however , the proximity that makes this object truly special .",
    "its most recent distance estimate places it at @xmath8 mpc @xcite , while other recent studies give : @xmath9 mpc , @xmath10mpc @xcite and @xmath11 mpc @xcite .",
    "being so close , cen a is also the closest agn and recent merger , a great case for testing our understanding of processes that shape galaxy formation and evolution .    the thick dust lane that crosses cen a , making it a show case for astronomical pr , hides the centre of the galaxy and its constituents . within the agn paradigm",
    ", it is expected that there is a suppermassive black hole at the bottom of cen a s potential well .",
    "indeed , recent studies , peering through the dust with near - infrared spectrographs , investigated this assumption and found that it is necessary to place a dark object in the nucleus with a mass of : m@xmath12m@xmath3 for inclination @xmath13 ( ground - based gas kinematics , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m@xmath14m@xmath3 for an edge - on model , m@xmath15m@xmath3 for @xmath16 and m@xmath17m@xmath3 for @xmath18 ( ground - based stellar kinematics , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m@xmath19m@xmath3 at @xmath16 ( ground - based adaptive optic assisted observations of gas kinematics , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and m@xmath20m@xmath3 for @xmath5 and m@xmath21m@xmath3 for @xmath16 . the last study also constrained the size of the central massive object to r @xmath22 pc suggesting that it is indeed a black hole .",
    "the importance of a robust measurement of cen a s m@xmath23 is highlighted in the fact that the above masses place the black hole in cen a approximately between 2 times and an order of magnitude above the m@xmath24 relation @xcite .",
    "although the large scatter in the relation and the low number statistics might be misleading , it is also possible that cen a , as a recent merger , is a special case @xcite .",
    "each of these studies brought an improvement in spatial and spectral resolution , but they were all based on observations with long - slits along a few position angles . for construction of dynamical models , whether stellar or gaseous , it is crucial to have sufficient information about the behaviour of the constraints . in the case of stellar dynamical models , it is necessary to observe the kinematics at all positions ( within @xmath25 ) to robustly constrain the orbital distribution @xcite , while for gaseous models the geometry of the gas disk can only be confirmed by two - dimensional mapping and only a well - ordered gas disk can be used to reliably determine the enclosed mass @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of cen a is active and the dusty and gaseous polar disk is significantly warped from small to large scales , where the disk alternates between having the southern side ( within 60 ) and northern side ( beyond 100 ) nearest to the observer ( see fig",
    ".  11 of @xcite and fig .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "when constructing dynamical models it is important to understand in what way these two properties shape the observations .",
    "the ionisation of emission - lines could be under a strong influence of the agn , while the kinematic signature of a disk warp could be hard to recognise from long - slit measurements only .",
    "in this paper we present the first observations with an integral - field spectrograph of the nucleus of cen a in the near - infrared . in section  [ s : obs ]",
    "we describe the observations and the data reduction . in section  [ s : res ]",
    "we analyse the data and compare them with existing observations .",

    "[ s : dyn ] we discuss the evidences for the central black hole .",
    "section  [ s : con ] summarises our conclusions .    throughout the study we assumed a distance to cen a of 3.5 mpc to be consistent with the dynamical studies mentioned above .",
    "we used the cambridge infra - red panoramic survey spectrograph , @xcite , mounted at the gemini south telescope , during the march 2003 queue scheduled observing campaign .",
    "some general observational details are given in table  [ observations ] .",
    "the  spectrograph , housed in an insulated cold room and cooled to -42@xmath26c , is a fibre fed instrument with observing capabilities in the  and  bands .",
    "operating at a moderate resolution ( r@xmath273,000 ) , the night sky oh emission spectrum is sufficiently dispersed to allow one to capitalise on its intrinsic darkness between emission lines .",

    "the ifu consists of a 490 element macrolens array arranged in a broadly rectangular structure , with hexagonal lens packing . through the use of re - imaging optics , in the focal plane ,",
    "two lens scales where available at gemini , 036 and 025 , giving fields of view of 13@xmath2847 and 93@xmath2835 respectively .",
    "we have used the 025 scale to study the central region of cen a with the spectral resolution of @xmath29  / pixel ( fwhm ) and resolution element of 1.8 pixels , in the spectral range between @xmath30 .",
    "data is recorded as series of on- and off - target exposures ( each 900 s ) .",
    "off - target sky exposures were taken with a sufficient offset ( 600 ) from the cen a nebulosity to avoid contamination from the galaxy .",
    "data reduction was performed following the recipe outlined in the  data reduction cookbookoptics / cirpass / index.html ] .",
    "the  data reduction tasks where used along side a suite of custom software written in the  programing environment .",
    "spectra are extracted form the beam - switched science frames , the sky frame and dome flats taken immediately prior to or after the science frames .",
    "standard star frames are also extracted , with a beam switch pair placing the star at either end of the ifu to allow sky subtraction without the need for offset sky frames .",
    "an optimal extraction routine is used to allow for the crosstalk between fibres .",
    "extracted spectra are then flat - fielded , using the normalised extracted flat field image .",
    "this step can not be performed before the extraction as it would remove much of the information on the fibre profiles which we wish to extract . a wavelength solution and 2d transformation to a common wavelength scale",
    "is performed using the  tasks _ identify , reidentify , fitcoo _ and _ transform_. an average oh night sky spectrum is used for the wavelength solution , using only stronger lines from the line list of @xcite and free from blends .",
    "the average flat field response is then multiplied back into the data to suppress the spectrum of the flat field lamp .",
    "a relative flux calibration is derived using observations of the standard star hip066842 . for the star ,",
    "a representative black - body spectrum is assumed and used to generate a spectral response function and telluric absorption correction , after interpolating across strong stellar absorption features .",
    "the spectrum of vega from the iraf synphot packages is used as a reference for the magnitude scale . both the observed and the reference vega spectrum are integrated over a clean region ( away from telluric and strong stellar features ) of the observed spectral range to find the calibration zero - point .",
    ".[observations]observational details [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : we adopt the date at the start of the chilean night , rather than the gemini default which would move all dates one day later .      during typical  observations , dither offsets on target",
    "are performed using integer lens offsets to allow straight - forward combination of the observational data sets .",
    "however , data in each passband was taken using a number of different offset strategies .",
    "alignment and combination is complicated further by the hexagonal lenslet array . in order to align and stack the various data sets we therefore resample the data onto a regular cartesian grid ,",
    "determine optimal image alignments via cross - correlation , and combine the data using integer pixel shifts .",
    "the process is as follows .    for data taken on different nights",
    "the wavelength solution was significantly different .",
    "we therefore first correct all data in a specific band to a common wavelength solution .",
    "we achieve this using an  implementation for the starlink figaro data reduction task scrunch which allows accurate variance array propagation on rebinning .",
    "a cartesian grid is generated which completely encloses the individual  ifu frames .",
    "since the entire cen a data set was recorded using a position angle ( @xmath31 ) of zero , no account need be taken of rotation of the ifu coordinate frame .",
    "the pitch of the regular grid is chosen to oversample the ifu lens scale .",
    "oversampling by a factor of three was found to give an excellent compromise between preserving the data integrity while keeping the output data set ( which has of the order of 1000 wavelength channels ) to a tractable size .",
    "a spectrum is assigned to each element of the regular array based on proximity to the elements of the ifu array .",
    "a set of integrated images is generated from these data cubes by summing along the dispersion axis , avoiding wavelength ranges subject to questionable data due to spectral curvature .",
    "these summed images are then cross - correlated , using elements of the  _ astrolib _ libraries @xcite .",
    "initial shift estimates are generated by eye from the summed images .",
    "the generated shifts are then used to apply integer pixel shifts to the resampled data cubes .",
    "variation in the recorded intensity of spectra within the individual observations was at the 10% level during each night and higher between nights ( due primarily to the difficulty associated with observing accurate standard stars , over a range of airmasses , before , during and after each data set is recorded ) .",
    "we therefore derive a multiplicative scaling factor to apply to each data set before the data is combined .",
    "the scaling factors are derived through measurement of the mean quotient between each data set and a reference data set , for all spectra which are found in the complete overlap region between all ifu pointings ( @xmath2733%  of the data ) .    after scaling each data cube ,",
    "the data are mean combined using a 3-sigma clipping algorithm to reject cosmic rays , which are still present to some extent in the data at this stage ( as there are too few degenerate frames for a simple sigma clipping of the unextracted data ) both as positive and negative features in the data due to the beam - switched sky subtraction .",
    "the resulting pixels scale is a factor of 3 smaller than the actual spatial resolution .",
    "we return to the original pixel size of 0252 by averaging spectra within neighbouring @xmath32 pixels .",
    "the error arrays were propagated by averaging in quadrature .      a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( _ s / n _ ) is required to reliably measure the properties of spectral lines . to achieve this , we spatially binned our merged data using an adaptive algorithm of @xcite creating compact and non - overlapping bins with uniform _",
    "s / n _ in faint regions . a desirable value of _ s / n _ depends on the purpose of the analysis .",
    "similarly , a way to estimate the",
    "_ s / n _ can be different .",
    "usually , if each pixel in a spectrum has a signal @xmath33 and a measurement uncertainty ( noise ) @xmath34 , then the _ s / n _ of the spectrum of @xmath35 pixels is given by    @xmath36    in this approach the main contribution to the signal comes from the continuum ( stellar ) light and it is used for measurement of stellar kinematics .",
    "on the other hand , emission - lines do not necessarily follow the level of the stellar continuum and when estimating their _ s / n _ it might be more useful to estimate the signal of the emission - line itself compared to the local noise of the spectral region surrounding the line . in this way , one is not including the information on the continuum and that is reflected in the resulting bins , which then directly trace the emission - lines .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we define amplitude - to - noise ratio ( _ a / n _ ) for each emission - line ( continuum subtracted spectra ) , where the amplitude ( @xmath37 ) of an emission line is estimated as a median of the three largest pixel values in the emission - line , and the noise ( @xmath38 ) is defined as the standard deviation of the spectra in the spectral region not contaminated by the presence of emission - lines .",
    "since emission - lines are not necessarily present everywhere over the field of view , we used both binning approaches .",
    "the _ s / n _ based binning is used to present the data , analyse the global properties and compare them with other observations ( section  [ s : res ] ) .",
    "we used a target _ s / n _ of 20 .",
    "the _ a / n _ based binning is used to measure the kinematics of individual lines ( section  [ s : kinem ] ) .",
    "we experimented with different ratios and found , similarly to @xcite , that _ a / n _ = 2.5 is the most appropriate to detect lines and reduce the loss of spatial resolution . both _",
    "s / n _ and _ a / n _ were chosen such as to minimise the degradation of spatial resolution in the central @xmath39 .",
    "in addition to cirpass data , we also used other data sets to supplement our analysis .",
    "these include ground - based optical and radio observations and space - based optical and x - ray imaging .",
    "we used reduced images of cen a obtained by the very large array ( vla ) in a - array configuration and with the chandra x - ray observatory , kindly provided by m. hardcastle .",
    "both images were observed , reduced and presented in @xcite .",
    "we also used archival near - infrared observations of the central region of cen a with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "these include broad and narrow band imaging using nicmos camera 2 ( 0075 pixel@xmath40 ) with f187n ( paschen @xmath41 ) and f222w ( k - band ) filters .",

    "there one can see the three major emission - lines which are of interest for this study .",
    "they are , in order of their observed relative strengths : [ feii ] @xmath4312567 , paschen @xmath0 @xmath4312818 and [ pii ] @xmath4311882 .",
    "the observed lines are redshifted , with respect to their laboratory values , by 22  , corresponding to a velocity of 543 @xmath44 .",
    "the first two lines were already observed by @xcite having the ratio of @xmath45 , but the observation of the [ pii ] line is , to our knowledge , the second extragalactic measurement of this emission - line , the first being in ngc  1068 by .",
    "the blue wings of the [ feii ] and pa@xmath0 emission - lines could be attributed to hei @xmath4312530 and hei @xmath4312790 emission .",

    "the vertical lines at the bottom of the spectrum show positions of the sky lines in the observed wavelength region . ]    the relative strengths of the lines can be used to determine the nature of the ionisation mechanism .",
    "we estimated the strength of the emission by fitting double gaussians ( see section  [ ss : dgaus ] for more details ) within apertures of increasing diameter , centred on the nucleus .",
    "table  [ t : ratio ] shows the measurement of the ratio of the lines . within a 025 aperture [ feii]/pa@xmath47 , while [ feii]/[pii ] @xmath48 .",
    "as the aperture increases the [ feii]/pa@xmath0 ratio fluctuates between 2.1 and 2.8 , being typical of active galaxies or supernova remnants , as can be seen from observations and line diagnostic diagrams . the active nucleus in cen",
    "a is an obvious source of [ feii ] emission - lines , and although it is possible that a fraction of the [ feii]/pa@xmath0 ratio is caused by star - formation ( e.g. supernova remnants in the star forming regions ) , the fact that [ feii ] emission is associated with shock , also points towards a mass outflow from the nucleus ( e.g. the jet ) and resulting shocks as the source of ionisation @xcite .",
    "the [ feii]/[pii ] ratio , however , shows a clearly increasing trend , reaching 4.7 at the largest aperture .",
    "this can be used to asses the importance of shocks in the total ionisation mechanism of [ feii ] lines . found that the [ feii]/[pii ] ratio is a good indicator for distinguishing the origin of the emission - lines , especially if they are ionised through photoionisation by soft x - rays or shocks propagating through the interstellar medium .",
    "the authors state that in regions with [ feii]/[pii ] @xmath49 gas is photoionised , while if [ feii]/[pii ] @xmath50 the material is excited by collisions in fast shock waves .",
    "the observed values of the ratio are between these two limiting values , although closer to the upper limit for photoionisation , suggesting the agn x - rays emission as the source of photoionisation .",
    "still , the rising values argue that shocks play an increasingly important role in ionising the interstellar medium further away from the nucleus .",

    "the kink in the jet could be explained as a deflection of the jet from a cloud complex which is now glowing in pa@xmath0 light .",

    "the spatial coordinates are ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , for top and bottom spectrum , respectively . ]      the most striking feature of the reconstructed images is the secondary peak in the integrated light which , in projection , is co - spatial with the radio jet , bounded by the two pa@xmath0 blobs and arises at the end of knot n1 .",
    "cen a was the first object for which it was suggested that star formation in certain regions was jet - induced @xcite , soon followed by the minkowski object @xcite , and numerous other objects with different environments and jet powers at low and high redshifts .",
    "the connection between the suggested nuclear star formation and the radio jet is , however , not as straight forward as at large scales , where blobs of optical emission and enhanced continuum correspond to specific jet structures . in this case , the end of a jet knot is followed by an increase in the total near - infrared flux , mostly coming from the continuum ( in the same region there are no strong emission - lines ) , and bounded with regions of detectable emission : north and east pa@xmath0 blobs and the nucleus .",
    "interestingly , the east pa@xmath0 blob coincides with the kink in the radio jet .",
    "there are a few possible explanations for these observations .",
    "the two most likely are that the ne flux peak is related to a jet - induced star formation or that it coincides with the location of a hole in the extinction . in the first scenario",
    ", star formation could happen under the influence of the jet as it plows through the inter - stellar medium pushing gas clouds away from its path , and resulting in a region with higher stellar continuum .",
    "in the same time , pa@xmath0 blobs could be ionised from the central engine or the jet , provided that they are on the unobscured path of non - thermal photons . in the second scenario ,",
    "the ne flux peak is visible because it is under an extinction hole .",
    "in addition to that , the north and east pa@xmath0 blobs may also originate in star forming regions where young stars provide enough photons to ionise gas clouds .",
    "the extinction hole is supported by hst / wfpc2 f814w images ( third panels on figs .  5 and  8 of * ? ? ? * ) on which the nucleus ( a faint point source ) and the less obscured ne region , which looks like a low extinction hole , are separated by a dust lane .",
    "the dereddend f814w image does not have similar features .",
    "the f222 m image ( k - band , presented on the same figures ) , which is less influenced by obscuring material shows only a marginal increase of flux in the ne region .",
    "the spectra from ne ( high continuum ) and sw ( low continuum ) regions are , however , very similar ( fig .  [ f:2spec ] ) , ne spectra being systematically higher , without any suggestion of change in the spectral slope , as it would be expected from regions of different extinction .    assuming that jet induced star formation is the source of the high continuum and the pa@xmath0 emission in the blobs , it is possible",
    "that the north pa@xmath0 blob was also once induced by the jet ( the jet is currently on the east pa@xmath0 blob ) , which precessed down with time ( in projection ) from @xmath64 to present @xmath65 .",
    "it is hard from the present observations to disentangle the true origin of the properties of the north - east region .",
    "the precession of the jet is perhaps a far - fetched assumption , but our data , which are not complete enough for a decisive conclusion , support marginally more the jet - induced star formation in the continuum region , where an extinction hole can also contribute to the detection .",
    "in the previous section we binned to a _ s / n _ ratio of 20 to present the data and discus the main trends . in this section",
    "we concentrate on the three observed emission - lines and use the _ a / n _ ratio based binning .",
    "we used a value of _ a / n _ = 2.5 for all three lines .",
    "the shape of the emission - lines on fig  [ f : spec ] suggest that single gaussians are not always adequate line models .",
    "hence , we fitted the spectral features with double gaussians when necessary .",
    "each of the three emission - lines in a given spectrum were fitted separately and independently .",
    "firstly , we fit the spectra with a 4th order polynomial avoiding the regions with the emission - lines . we subtract this continuum contribution and each emission - line we fit with a single gaussian .",

    "this is , in practice , often quite difficult , especially if there are deviations from circular rotation or data are noisy . in our case , we decided to determine only global properties and to do that through a two stage process .",

    "we will , however , following the recent results , continue in the framework of the warped disk .",
    "comparing the orientation and the extent of the velocity dispersion plateau with the tilted ring model of @xcite and @xcite , we suggest that the origin of the high velocity dispersion is in the unresolved rotation coming from different folds of the warped disk .",
    "we draw this conclusion from figs .  10 and 11 of @xcite and figs .  5 and 7 of @xcite , which show that the disk changes its orientation such that in the inner part of the disk ( @xmath119 ) its sw points and in the outer part ( @xmath120 ) its ne points are closest to the observer .",
    "although both studies construct the warped disk model to larger radii ( beyond 40 ) than what we present in this work , the orientation of the high velocity dispersion plateau ( @xmath85 or @xmath121 ) agrees well with the measured orientation of the warped disk .",
    "this means that our line - of - sight crosses the disk a few ( at least two ) times , and the observed kinematics will depend on where the ionisation of the gas clouds occurs .",

    "these regions are typically seen in the narrow line region environment of an agn , where x - ray photons from the central engine can penetrate deep into the cloud .",

    "this suggests a possible jet - induced star forming region in cen a on scales of @xmath177 pc , in addition to the well known large scale ( 1kpc ) jet - induced star forming region . *",
    "the location of the east pa@xmath0 blob coincides with the kink in the radio jet suggesting a direct link between the two phenomena .",
    "if one assumes that the north pa@xmath0 blob was also induced by the jet , the position of the blobs show that the jet precessed for about 25 in projection .",
    "* we detect [ pii ] emission , which can be used together with [ feii ] emission to discriminate between photo- and shock - induced ionisation of gas clouds .",
    "the [ feii]/[pii ] ratio rises steadily with radius , being close , but above pure photo - ionisation levels .",
    "this suggests that shocks are more important with increasing distance from the centre . *",
    "we determined spatially resolved kinematics from pa@xmath0 and [ feii ] emission - lines . although the emission ( of both lines ) is divided in blobs or it is patchy at certain regions , it has a well defined and uniform sense of rotation and spatially separated emission regions are part of the same kinematic structure .",
    "the velocity dispersion is low for pa@xmath0 , but high for [ feii ] emission with a plateau oriented at @xmath178 .",
    "the low dispersion is suggestive of a motion in a regular disk for pa@xmath0 , but the plateau in the [ feii ] velocity dispersion is a clear evidence of a more complex distribution of ionised iron . *",
    "kinematics of both emission - lines is remarkably similar in appearance , as traced by zvc : central regions are rotating around an ew axis , while at larger radii there is a twist in zvc and the rotation is around ne  sw axis .",
    "the twist in zvc suggest contribution from a bar - like perturbation or a warp in the disk on 20 pc scales . *",
    "we test the assumption that the emission in the central 1 - 2 is confined to a disk by constructing maps of circular velocity and comparing them with observations .",
    "this process is divided in two steps .",
    "we first determine the @xmath31 and ( using this position angle ) the inclination of the assumed disk .",
    "the best fitting parameters are : @xmath179 and @xmath180 for pa@xmath0 and @xmath181 and @xmath182 for [ feii ] . using these values we extract circular velocity component and remove it from the data .",
    "the residual map of pa@xmath0 velocities is noisy without recognisable pattern and residuals are largely within measurement errors .",
    "[ feii ] residuals are more complicated , showing a three - fold pattern and being somewhat larger than measurement uncertainties .",
    "this can be traced to the twist in the zvc .",
    "we conclude that the emission in the central 1 , the region which is likely to be within the sphere of influence of the central black hole , is consistent with being in circular motion in a disk , but outer regions show departures which could be attributed to perturbations ( such as a bar ) or to a warp extending inwards from 1 kpc scales ( as previously detected in cen a ) to 20 pc scales . * a shallower rotation curve of the [ feii ] emission is likely related to the high velocity dispersion and the geometry of the warped disk .",
    "we speculate that the excitation of [ feii ] line happens also at larger radii from the central engine and the line - of - sight passes two times through the warped disk , such that at the spatial resolution of our observations the data contain a contributions of gas moving in two different directions ( lowering the velocity , but increasing the velocity dispersion ) .",
    "this is supported by coinciding orientations of the high velocity dispersion region and the warped disk . following this",
    ", we do not consider our [ feii ] kinematics for determining the mass of the central black hole .",
    "* we construct simple dynamical models of the pa@xmath0 emission - line disk to determine the mass of the central black hole .",
    "for the geometry of disks we use kinematically determined orientation parameters .",
    "we measure m@xmath183 m@xmath3 .",
    "this value is consistent with previous measurements , while the predicted value of the black hole mass from the m@xmath127 relation is excluded at the @xmath7 level ( for a 2d distribution ) , taking into account the scatter of the relation .",
    "* we construct models with different geometrical orientations taken from previous studies , which give similar results , being marginally less good , but often statistically indistinguishable .",
    "we also construct models using literature values for m@xmath23 and the value predicted by the m@xmath184 relation , but leaving geometrical parameters free .",
