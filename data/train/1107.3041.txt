    "in the last several years , the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite and the submillimeter array @xcite have provided images of protoplanetary discs in an increasing variety of molecular line emissions . the field will be advanced further by the completion of the submillimeter array disc imaging survey @xcite .",
    "it will be revolutionised through the use of the atacama large millimetre / submillimetre array ( alma ) , which will allow much weaker lines to be investigated , and thus will enable the characterisation of a more diverse range of processes @xcite .",

    "* ) have presented computational results for the chemical composition of protoplanetary discs . because @xmath0-disc models were adopted , these studies are relevant to protoplanetary discs that transport mass locally , both instantaneously and averaged in time , and by extension , to discs that possess global axisymmetry .",
    "for this reason , @xmath0-disc models may be inappropriate during early phases of gas accretion on to protoplanetary discs if discs become massive enough to trigger gas phase gravitational instabilities ( gis ) @xcite .",
    "gis produce dynamic nonaxisymmetric structure in the form of spiral waves leading to shocks ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) but , for non - fragmenting cases , it is generally agreed that gravitational torques caused by spiral waves lead to significant mass transport @xcite .",
    "such mass transport may have implications for disc driven outbursts and recent , successful models for fu orionis outbursts have been developed for the assumption that gis dominate mass transport outside disc radii of a few au in non - fragmenting discs @xcite .",
    "simulations @xcite including layered accretion in the dead zone @xcite as well as transport by gis show that , when discs accrete from rapidly rotating cloud cores , disc masses can become comparable to those of their central stars .",
    "simple @xmath0-disc models for disc evolution overlook the episodic heating induced by gi spiral shocks in massive discs @xcite .",
    "these shocks can cause desorption of volatiles from dust grains and can trigger gas - phase chemical reactions that would not otherwise occur .",
    "both effects can produce observable chemical signatures of disc dynamics .    in this paper , we present results from a chemical model of a massive , young protoplanetary disc in which gis cause the formation of spiral waves .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] outlines the physical and chemical models we have utilised , and the assumed initial conditions .",
    "section [ sec : results ] contains results for the time - dependent fractional abundances within an individual fluid element and column density maps of the entire disc for different species .",
    "a comparison of results from this model with those of other models of disc chemistry are also given .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] presents conclusions based on the results and comments on further avenues of research .",
    "we use a hydrodynamic simulation of a massive ( @xmath3m@xmath4 ) protoplanetary disc as the basis for the physical input to our chemical model .",
    "most of the mass in the disc initially extends from a radial distance @xmath5 to @xmath6au from the central , solar - mass protostar .",
    "the system represents an early class i object , which would likely evolve into an f - type main sequence star .",
    "the disc is modelled with chymera @xcite , which solves the equations of hydrodynamics with self - gravity on a fixed , cylindrical eulerian grid .",
    "the computational domain has 256 , 128 and 64 zones in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , with a physical resolution of @xmath10au .",
    "mirror symmetry about the midplane is assumed .",
    "all grid boundaries have outflow conditions allowing mass to leave the global disc simulation , where the inner boundary is set to approximately @xmath11au , but no mass is allowed to enter .",
    "the central star is allowed to move freely , and the equation of motion for it is integrated as described in @xcite .",
    "we use the @xcite equation of state with a fixed ortho - to - para ratio of hydrogen molecules of 3:1 ( which is only relevant for the evolution of the physical model ) .",
    "the fractional mass abundances of hydrogen , helium and more massive elements are set to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . because the hydrogen is almost entirely in h@xmath2 ,",
    "the mean molecular weight is @xmath15amu .",
    "for cooling , we use the radiative cooling approximation described in @xcite . an incident radiation field on the disc",
    "is assumed to have a black body spectrum with a temperature varying as @xmath16k to account for heating by the star .",
    "the initial disc model is prepared using the method described in @xcite .",
    "an analytic disc model is first created , with a @xcite @xmath17 for most of the disc .",
    "the spiral instability sets in around @xmath18 @xcite , so the initial model represents conditions before a strong burst of gravitational instabilities , as might be expected during the earliest stages of disc evolution .",
    "a flat @xmath19 profile with the irradiation law noted above requires the surface density to follow , roughly , @xmath20 .",
    "this initial configuration is assumed to undergo keplerian rotation and have an adiabatic index of 5/3 .",
    "these assumptions about the initial rotation and value of the adiabatic index can lead to large radial oscillations at the start of the simulation due to the associated deviations from equilibrium . to avoid some of this behavior ,",
    "we evolve the analytic model in chymera at low azimuthal resolution ( 8 zones ) for 500@xmath21yr , which is about two orbital periods near @xmath22au .",
    "when the disc is loaded on to the higher resolution grid , a 5% cell - to - cell random noise is added to the density distribution , which seeds the growth of nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "this is considered to be the time @xmath23 in the initial disc .",
    "the disc is then run at higher azimuthal resolution for an additional @xmath24yr .",
    "figure [ fig : nnden ] shows the column density of nuclei for the disc viewed from above at the end of the simulation .      at the start of the full simulation ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "1000 fluid elements are randomly distributed throughout the disc , weighted by mass .",
    "these fluid elements are evolved along with the main simulation , and their thermal histories are recorded , as described in @xcite .",
    "the division of the disc into more fluid element would have allowed the capture of rare events such as shocks that are atypically strong for the radii at which they occur .",
    "this would lead to slightly greater average gas phase abundances of species that are hard to desorb .",
    "however , this would not affect our overall conclusions . by the end of the simulation",
    ", 5 fluid elements were lost through grid boundaries , leaving 995 elements with complete thermal histories .",
    "963 of these were used to study the chemical evolution in the disc .",
    "results for 16 of the 32 remaining fluid elements were not used to generate chemical results because the jump , for each of those 16 , in the physical conditions from those at the end of the dynamical calculation back to those at the start of the dynamical calculation created difficulties for the integration of the chemical rate equations .",
    "results for the other 16 were not used because spiked extrema in them caused problems for the chemical integration .",
    "these extrema occurred at temperatures of around @xmath26k - @xmath27k .",
    "the 32 elements were randomly distributed at the end of the simulation , and had not passed through shocks near the end of the dynamical calculation , so their influence on the chemical results was negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : discparcels ] shows the distribution of the final locations of the fluid elements used in the chemical modelling .",
    "figure [ fig : temps ] shows the maximum line - of - sight temperature and the mass - averaged temperature @xmath28 along the line - of - sight for a face - on view of the final disc . here",
    "@xmath29 is the number density of nuclei ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : n ] ) , @xmath30 is the temperature and d@xmath9 is an infinitesimal path length along the line - of - sight .",
    "the maximum and mass - weighted line - of - sight temperatures were calculated from the full hydrodynamic model results , rather than from the properties of the massive fluid elements used in the chemical calculations , because the full hydrodynamic model results provide higher spatial resolution .",
    "the spiral structure is clearly seen in the maximum line - of - sight temperature map .",
    "the structure is also seen in the mass - averaged temperature map , but is somewhat less sharply defined .",
    "the difference in the maps is due to the high temperature region being somewhat , but not highly , limited in extent .",
    "it lies near the midplane and contains only a fraction of the disc mass .",
    "figure [ fig : tnslice ] shows results , taken from the complete hydrodynamical data , for the temperature and number density of nuclei in planes containing the rotation axis and either the north - south axis ( @xmath31 ) or the east - west axis ( @xmath32 ) from fig .",
    "[ fig : discparcels ] . the temperature is less than @xmath33k outside the inner @xmath34au of the disc , while within it , the temperature can reach up to @xmath35k .",
    "the number density plot shows that the highest density gas lies in a ring - like structure at approximately @xmath36au from the centre .        the temperature and density histories of the fluid elements shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discparcels ] form the physical input to the chemical model .",
    "figure [ fig : tracks ] shows the evolution of the temperature and density of one of the fluid elements .",
    "this element begins at @xmath37au above the midplane , approximately @xmath26au from the centre of the disc .",
    "it follows a nearly circular path that slowly increases in radius .",
    "after one - and - a - half orbits , or @xmath38yr , it encounters the first shock .",
    "both shocks do not affect the circular motion , but instead cause the element to rise to approximately @xmath39au above the midplane .      the results for this track provide a useful example , because the fluid element experiences a relatively quiescent period for @xmath38yr , before encountering the shocks .",
    "these shocks rapidly raise the temperature to a maximum of @xmath40k and the number density to @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "the temperature and density appear to peak at the same time and drop together .",
    "this is due to the increase in the pressure caused by a shock driving an expansion of gas parallel to the shock and obliquely to the mid - plane of the disc that begins almost immediately behind the shock ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the chemical computation is based on a network of rate equations involving 1334 reactions and 125 species containing the elements h , he , c , o , n , na and s. these reactions were originally selected from a subset of the umist rate 95 database @xcite .",
    "data from the kinetic database for astrochemistry , kida , were used to update some of the rates and rate coefficients .",
    "thermal desorption processes ( discussed in detail below ) and some three - body reactions ( see appendix [ sec:3br ] ) were added to the network .    at each time - step in the chemical network , the temperature and mass density of each fluid element are derived with cubic spline fits to the data provided for the element from the physical model .",
    "these interpolated values of the temperature and mass density are then used in the time - integration of the rate equations .",
    "the number density of nuclei , @xmath29 , is calculated from the mass density , @xmath43 , by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the number densities of hydrogen , helium and more massive nuclei , respectively . we have assumed a molar mass of @xmath48 g mol@xmath49 , which is appropriate for a relative abundance of helium - to - hydrogen of 0.09 with trace amounts of more massive elements .",
    "integrations were performed with the dvode package @xcite to obtain the fractional abundance , @xmath50 , of each species .",
    "the rate equation for the gas - phase fractional abundance of the @xmath51th species is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the rate coefficient of the @xmath54th reaction and the summations are restricted so that only reactions involved in the formation or removal of the @xmath51th species are included .",
    "@xmath55 is the rate at which direct cosmic - ray ionisation and cosmic - ray - induced photoemission remove species @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are source terms due to three - body reactions and adsorption on to and desorption from grain surfaces , respectively .",
    "we assume that the only third body of importance is h@xmath2 , an assumption which introduces only an insignificant error .",
    "thus , @xmath58      here we present a brief summary of the forms of the gas - phase rate coefficients and rates that we have adopted .",
    "more detail can be found in the primary paper on the umist rate 95 database @xcite .",
    "the reaction rates and coefficients that we use are provided online .    the rate coefficient for the @xmath54th two- or three - body reaction is of the standard arrhenius form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the room temperature rate coefficient of the reaction ( at @xmath61k )",
    ", @xmath62 describes the temperature dependence and @xmath63 is the activation energy of the reaction .",
    "the rate for the destruction of species @xmath51 due to cosmic rays is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a proportionality constant , @xmath66 is the cosmic ray ionisation rate , @xmath67 is a constant and @xmath68 is the dust grain albedo , which we take to be 0.5 . because the two terms on the right represent the physically distinct processes of direct cosmic ray induced ionisation and of destruction due to photoemission induced by the collisions of molecular hydrogen with energetic electrons produced by the ionisation , data tables give @xmath65 and @xmath67 separately .    though photoabsorption of radiation from external sources will affect the chemistry in the outer layers of a disc , we focus on the bulk of the disc material and assume that it is well shielded from external sources of photons .",
    "thus , we neglect photoabsorption , other than that of cosmic - ray - induced photoemission .      with minor exceptions , we assume that no surface chemistry occurs , though we recognise that surface chemistry is important in establishing the chemical initial conditions that we adopt .",
    "the exceptions concern the neutralisation of ions , which we assume occurs when they are adsorbed .",
    "while studies of the chemistry of discs including surface reactions and grain evolution have been performed @xcite , such chemistry remains very uncertain .",
    "this is why we have assumed that the initial abundances reflect those of cometary ices ( see section [ sec : initial ] ) .",
    "@xmath57 has contributions due to adsorption and desorption , and we take @xmath69 where @xmath70 the sticking coefficient @xmath71 is set to unity , and we take the ratio of the number density of dust grains to the number density of nuclei to be @xmath72 , which is appropriate for a dust grain radius and grain - to - gas mass ratio of about @xmath73 @xmath74 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "@xmath75 is the gas temperature , @xmath76 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath77 is the molecular mass in amu and @xmath78 is the mass of a hydrogen atom .",
    "we treat thermal desorption in the same way as @xcite , and @xmath79 where @xmath80 is surface density of binding sites , which we take to be @xmath81@xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 is the binding energy of the @xmath51th species on the surface of the dust grain , @xmath84 is the dust temperature ( which we assume to be in equilibrium with @xmath75 ) , the factor @xmath85 represents the fraction of the surface of the dust grain covered by the @xmath51th species , given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the solid fractional abundance of the @xmath51th species and @xmath88 is the typical number of binding sites per grain , taken to be @xmath89 .",
    "the characteristic vibrational frequency of the species attached to the grain is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass of the @xmath51th species @xcite .",
    "the binding energies were taken from @xcite , references therein , and the osu database ] .",
    "the initial gas - phase fractional abundances were assumed to have the same ratios to one another as the fractional abundances of the corresponding ices in comet hale - bopp as given by @xcite , and they are given in table [ tab : ics ] . because comets are thought to have undergone significant chemical processing at the edges of discs , this assumption may not be entirely appropriate .",
    "however , comparisons between the compositions of cometary ices and interstellar ices imply a general consistency between the two , though some discrepancies exist @xcite ."
