    "despite its successes in describing known macroscopic gravitational phenomena , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) still lacks the status of a fundamental microscopic theory .",
    "this is so because the theory admits singular solutions under very general assumptions , and all attempts to quantize gr encounter serious difficulties . among various attempts to overcome these problems ,",
    "gauge theories of gravity are especially attractive , as they are based on the concept of gauge symmetry which has been very successful in the foundation of other fundamental interactions .",
    "the importance of the poincar symmetry in particle physics leads one to consider the poincar gauge theory ( pgt ) as a natural framework for a description of the gravitational phenomena [ 16 ] ( for more general attempts , see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we give an introduction to pgt and general dirac s formalism , and a review of the constrained dynamical structure of pgt , aimed at a fairly general audience .",
    "we begin our exposition by giving a short outline of pgt in sec .",
    "2 . in the next section",
    "we introduce basic concepts of dirac s hamiltonian formalism , which are essential for a clear understanding of the canonical and gauge structure of any gauge theory .",
    "then , we discuss the construction of the hamiltonian and the algebra of constraints in the general pgt ( sec .",
    "4 ) , derive the related generator of poincar gauge symmetry ( sec . 5 ) , and introduce the important concept of energy ( and other conserved charges ) on the basis of the asymptotic structure of spacetime ( sec . 6 ) .",
    "the teleparallel form of gr is an interesting limit of pgt , both theoretically and observationally ; its canonical properties are discussed in sec",
    "section 8 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "our general conventions , with some exceptions in sect . 3 ,",
    "are the following : the latin indices refer to the local lorentz frame , whereas the greek indices refer to the coordinate frame ; the first letters of both alphabets @xmath0 run over @xmath1 , while the middle alphabet letters @xmath2 run over @xmath3 ; @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is completely antisymmetric tensor normalized to @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that the existence and interaction of certain fields , such as the electromagnetic field , can be closely related to invariance properties of the theory .",
    "thus , for instance , if the lagrangian of matter fields is invariant under phase transformations with _ constant _ parameters @xmath7 , the electromagnetic field can be introduced by demanding the invariance under the extended , _ local _ transformations , obtained by replacing @xmath7 with a function of spacetime points , @xmath8 .    on the other hand , it is much less known that einstein s gr is invariant under local poincar transformations .",
    "this property is based on the principle of equivalence , and gives a rich physical content to the concept of local ( or gauge ) symmetry . instead of thinking of local poincar symmetry",
    "as derived from the principle of equivalence , the whole idea can be reversed , in accordance with the usual philosophy of gauge theories .",
    "when gravitational field is absent , it has become clear from a host of experiments that the underlying symmetry of fundamental interactions is given by the poincar group .",
    "if we now want to make a physical theory invariant under _ local _ poincar transformations , it is necessary to introduce new , _ compensating _ ( or gauge ) fields , which , in fact , represent the gravitational interaction [ 16 ] .    in physical processes at low energies gravitational field",
    "does not have a significant role , since the gravitational interaction is extremely weak .",
    "the spacetime without gravity is described by the special relativity theory ( sr ) , and its mathematical structure corresponds to minkowski space @xmath9 .",
    "any physical observer in @xmath9 uses some _ reference frame _ , endowed with coordinates @xmath10 @xmath11 , serving to identify physical events .",
    "inertial _ observer can always choose global inertial coordinates , such that the infinitesimal interval has the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the metric tensor .",
    "the equivalence of inertial reference frames is expressed by the global ( rigid ) poincar symmetry @xmath14 in @xmath9 .    at each point of @xmath9 ,",
    "labeled by coordinates @xmath10 , one can define an inertial laboratory by a local lorentz frame  a set of four orthonormal , tangent vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , called the tetrad . in global inertial",
    "coordinates @xmath10 , one can always choose the tetrad such that it coincides with a coordinate frame @xmath17 ( a set of four vectors , tangent to coordinate lines at @xmath18 ) , i.e. @xmath19 . here",
    ", the latin indices @xmath20 refer to local lorentz frames , while the greek indices @xmath21 refer to coordinate frames .",
    "the physics of fundamental interactions is successfully described by lagrangian field theory . dynamical variables in this theory are fields @xmath22 , and dynamics is determined by a function of fields and their derivatives , @xmath23 , called the lagrangian .",
    "the action integral @xmath24 is invariant under an arbitrary spacetime transformation @xmath25 , @xmath26 , provided the lagrangian satisfies the condition @xcite _ 0+_m(^m)=0 , where @xmath27 . note that this condition can be , in fact , relaxed , by allowing an arbitrary four  divergence to appear on the right hand side .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath28 satisfying the above invariance condition is called an invariant density .",
    "consider now a matter field @xmath29 in spacetime , referred to a local lorentz frame .",
    "its transformation law under the global poincar transformations @xmath30 has the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the poincar generators , and @xmath34 is the spin matrix . using the invariance condition ( 2.1 )",
    ", one finds that the invariance of the lagrangian @xmath35 under @xmath14 leads to the conservation of energy ",
    "momentum and angular momentum currents .",
    "localization of poincar symmetry leads to poincar gauge theory of gravity , in which _ both _ energy  momentum and spin currents of matter fields are naturally included into gravitational dynamics , in contrast to gr .",
    "we now describe the process of transition from global to local poincar symmetry , and find its relation to the gravitational interaction .",
    "other spacetime symmetries [ de sitter , conformal , etc .",
    "] can be treated in an analogous manner .",
    "consider a lagrangian for matter fields , @xmath36 , defined with respect to a local lorentz frame and invariant under @xmath14 .",
    "if we now generalize global poincar transformations by replacing ten _ constant _ group parameters @xmath37 with some _ functions _ of spacetime points , the invariance condition is violated .",
    "the violation of ( local ) invariance can be compensated by certain modifications of the original theory . after introducing the _ covariant derivative _ , _",
    "k = h_k^_= h_k^ ( _ + a^ij__ij ) , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the compensating fields , the modified , invariant lagrangian for matter fields takes the form _",
    "m = b_m(,_k ) , where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the inverse of @xmath38 .",
    "it is obtained from the original lagrangian @xmath35 in two steps :    by replacing @xmath42 ( minimal coupling ) , and    multiplying @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath45 satisfies eq . by construction , hence it is an invariant density .",
    "the matter lagrangian is made invariant under local transformations by introducing compensating fields . in order to construct an invariant lagrangian for the new fields @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath39 , we introduce the corresponding _ field strengths _ , & & f^ij_= _ a^ij_+a^i_sa^sj_- ( ) , + & & f^i_= _ b^i_+a^i_sb^s_- ( ) , related to the lorentz and translation subgroups of @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the new lagrangian must be an invariant density depending only on the lorentz and translation field strengths , so that the complete lagrangian of matter and gauge fields has the form = b_f(f^ij_kl , f^i_kl)+b_m(,_k ) .",
    "up to this point , we have not given any geometric interpretation to the new , compensating fields @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "such an interpretation is possible and useful , and it leads to a new understanding of gravity .",
    "now , we introduce some basic geometric concepts in order be able to understand the geometric meaning of pgt @xcite .    spacetime is often described as a ",
    "four  dimensional continuum \" . in sr",
    ", it has the structure of minkowski space @xmath9 . in the presence of gravity spacetime",
    "can be divided into  small , flat pieces \" in which sr holds ( on the basis of the principle of equivalence ) , and these pieces are  sewn together \" smoothly .",
    "although spacetime looks locally like @xmath9 , it may have quite different global properties .",
    "mathematical description of such four  dimensional continuum is given by the concept of a _",
    "differentiable manifold_.    we assume that spacetime has a structure of a differentiable manifold @xmath47 . on @xmath47 one can define differentiable mappings , tensors , and various algebraic operations with tensors at a given point ( addition , multiplication , contraction ) .",
    "however , comparing tensors at different points requires some additional structure on @xmath47 : the law of parallel transport , defined by a linear ( or affine ) _ connection _ .",
    "an @xmath47 equipped with  is called _ linearly connected space _ , @xmath48 .",
    "linear connection is equivalently defined by the covariant derivative ; thus , for instance , @xmath49 .",
    "linear connection is not a tensor , but its antisymmetric part defines a tensor called the torsion tensor : @xmath50 .",
    "parallel transport is a path dependent concept .",
    "if we parallel transport a vector around an infinitesimal closed path , the result is proportional to the riemann curvature tensor : @xmath51 .    on",
    "@xmath47 one can define _ metric tensor _ as a symmetric , nondegenerate tensor field of type @xmath52 .",
    "after that we can introduce the scalar product of two tangent vectors and calculate lengths of curves , angles between vectors , etc .",
    "linear connection and metric are geometric objects independent of each other .",
    "the differentiable manifold @xmath47 , equipped with linear connection and metric , becomes _ linearly connected metric space _ @xmath53 .    in order to preserve lengths and angles under parallel transport in @xmath53",
    ", one can impose the _ metricity condition _",
    "-_^g_-_^g_=0 , which relates @xmath54 and .",
    "the requirement of vanishing nonmetricity establishes local minkowskian structure on @xmath47 , and defines a metric compatible linear connection .",
    "a space @xmath53 with the most general metric compatible linear connection  is called _ riemann  cartan _ space @xmath55 .",
    "if the torsion vanishes , @xmath55 becomes _ riemann _ space @xmath56 of gr ; if , alternatively , the curvature vanishes , @xmath55 becomes weitzenbck s _ teleparallel _ space @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the condition @xmath58 transforms @xmath56 into minkowski space @xmath9 , and @xmath59 transforms @xmath57 into @xmath9 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the choice of basis in a tangent space is not unique .",
    "coordinate frame @xmath60 and local lorentz frame @xmath61 are of particular practical importance .",
    "every tangent vector can be expressed in both frames : @xmath62 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 . as a consequence ,",
    "we find that @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we denote the connection components with respect to coordinate and local lorentz frames as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "linear connection and metric are geometric objects independent of the choice of frame .",
    "their components are defined with respect to a frame and are , clearly , frame  dependent .",
    "the final result of the analysis of pgt is the construction of the invariant lagrangian .",
    "it is achieved by introducing new fields @xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) and @xmath39 , which are used to construct the covariant derivative @xmath71 and the field strengths @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this theory can be thought of as a field theory in @xmath9 . however , geometric analogies are so strong , that it would be unnatural to ignore them .",
    "the following properties are essential for the geometric interpretation of pgt :    the lorentz gauge field @xmath39 can be identified with the lorentz connection @xmath68 , or , equivalently , the covariant derivative @xmath74 can be identified with @xmath75 ;    the translation gauge field @xmath41 can be identified with the tetrad @xmath76 ;    local lorentz symmetry of pgt implies the metricity condition .",
    "consequently , pgt has the geometric structure of riemann  cartan space @xmath55 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the field strengths @xmath73 and @xmath77 represent geometrically the torsion @xmath78 and the curvature @xmath79 , respectively .    since riemann ",
    "cartan space has locally the structure of @xmath9 , it follows that pgt is consistent with the principle of equivalence @xcite .",
    "thus , pgt is a gauge approach to the theory of gravity , possessing a transparent _ geometric and physical _ interpretation .",
    "despite many successes of quantum theory in describing basic physical phenomena , one is continually running into difficulties in some specific physical situations .",
    "thus , all attempts to quantize the theory of gravity encounter serious difficulties . in order to find a solution of these problems , it seems to be useful to reconsider the fundamental principles of classical dynamics . in this context , the principles of hamiltonian dynamics are seen to be of great importance for a basic understanding of both classical and quantum theory .    in gauge theories",
    "the number of dynamical variables in the action is larger than the number of physical variables .",
    "the presence of unphysical variables is closely related to the existence of gauge symmetries . in the hamiltonian formalism dynamical systems of this type",
    "are characterized by the presence of constraints . here",
    ", we present the basic ideas of the constrained hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .    in order to simplify the exposition we start by considering a classical system of particles , described by coordinates @xmath80 and the action @xmath81 . to go over to the hamiltonian formalism we introduce , in the usual way , the momentum variables : p_i = lq_if_i(q , q ) ( i=1,2, ...",
    ",n ) . in simple dynamical theories these relations can be inverted , so that _ all _ velocities can be expressed in terms of the coordinates and momenta , whereupon one can simply define the hamiltonian function . however , for many interesting theories such an assumption would be too restrictive .",
    "therefore , we shall allow for the possibility that momentum variables are not independent functions of velocities , i.e. that there exist _ constraints _ : _",
    "m(q , p)=0 ( m=1,2, ... ,p ) .",
    "the variables @xmath82 are local coordinates on the phase space @xmath83 . the relations ( 3.2a ) are called _ primary constraints _ ; they determine a subspace @xmath84 of @xmath83 , in which the time development of a dynamical system takes place .",
    "the geometric structure of the subspace @xmath84 can be very complicated . if @xmath85 the rank of the matrix @xmath86 is constant on @xmath84 , and @xmath87 all the constraint functions @xmath88 are independent ( irreducible ) , then the jacobian @xmath89 is of rank @xmath90 on @xmath84 .",
    "accordingly , the dimension of @xmath84 is well defined and equal to @xmath91 .    at this stage",
    "we introduce the useful notions of weak and strong equality .",
    "let @xmath92 be a function which is defined and differentiable in a neighborhood @xmath93 containing the subspace @xmath84 .",
    "if the restriction of @xmath92 on @xmath84 vanishes , we say that @xmath94 is weakly equal to zero : @xmath95 .",
    "if the function @xmath94 and all its first derivatives vanish on @xmath84 , than @xmath94 is strongly equal to zero : @xmath96 .",
    "for strong equality we shall use the usual equality sign .",
    "this definition is especially useful in the analysis of the equations of motion , which contain derivatives of functions on @xmath84 .    by using these conventions",
    "the relations can be written as weak equalities : _",
    "m(q , p)0 ( m=1,2, ... ,p ) .",
    "it is now interesting to clarify the relation between strong and weak equalities : if @xmath92 vanishes weakly , @xmath97 , what can one say about the derivatives of @xmath94 on @xmath84 ?",
    "by use of the general method of calculus of variations with constraints , one can show that @xmath97 implies @xmath98 , where @xmath99 are some multipliers , and @xmath100 is a quantity whose derivatives are weakly vanishing : it can be zero , a constant , or second or higher power of a constraint . for theories in which the constraint functions @xmath88 satisfy the above regularity condition @xmath85 and @xmath87 , one can show that @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "consider now the quantity h_c = p_iq_i - l(q , q ) . by making variations in @xmath102 and",
    "@xmath103 one finds that @xmath104 can be expressed in terms of @xmath102 s and @xmath105 s only , independent of velocities .",
    "expressed in this way it becomes the _",
    "canonical _ hamiltonian .",
    "since @xmath104 is not uniquely defined in the presence of constraints , it is natural to introduce the _ total _ hamiltonian h_t = h_c+u^m_m , where @xmath106 s are , at this stage , arbitrary multipliers . by varying this expression with respect",
    "to @xmath107 one obtains the constraints and the hamiltonian equations of motions involving arbitrary multipliers .",
    "the hamiltonian equations for an arbitrary dynamical quantity @xmath108 can be written in the form g=\\ { g , h_c } + u^m\\ { g,_m}\\ { g , h_t } , where @xmath109 is the poisson bracket ( pb ) of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "equations describe the motion of a system in the subspace @xmath84 of dimension @xmath91 .",
    "the motion is described by @xmath112 coordinates @xmath82 satisfying @xmath90 constraints ; as a consequence , there appear @xmath90 multipliers in the evolution equations .",
    "explicit elimination of some coordinates is possible , but it may lead to a violation of locality and/or covariance .",
    "a basic consistency of the theory requires that the primary constraints be conserved during the temporal evolution of the system : _",
    "m = \\{_m , h_c } + u^n\\{_m,_n}0 . if the equations of motion are consistent , the above conditions reduce to the one of the following three cases : @xmath113 an identity , 0=0 ; @xmath114 an equation independent of the multipliers , yielding a new , _ secondary constraint _ : @xmath115 ; @xmath116 a restriction on the @xmath117 s .",
    "if we find some secondary constraints in the theory , they also have to satisfy consistency conditions of the type .",
    "the process continues until all consistency conditions are exhausted . as a final result",
    "we are left with a number of new constraints , and a number of conditions on the multipliers .",
    "let us denote all the constraints in the theory as @xmath118 .",
    "these constraints define a subspace @xmath119 of the phase space @xmath83 , such that @xmath120 .",
    "the notions of weak and strong equalities are now defined with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "since the consistency requirements lead , in general , to some conditions on the multipliers , the total hamiltonian can be written in the form h_t= h + v^a_a ( a=1,2, ... ,n_1 ) where @xmath121 , @xmath122 are determined and @xmath123 arbitrary multipliers .",
    "thus , even after all the consistency requirements are satisfied , we still have _ arbitrary _ functions of time in the theory . as a consequence , dynamical variables at some future instant of time",
    "are _ not uniquely _ determined by their initial values .",
    "a dynamical variable @xmath124 is said to be first class ( fc ) if it has weakly vanishing pbs with all constraints in the theory : @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath126 is not first class , it is called second class .",
    "while the distinction between primary and secondary constraints is of little importance in the final form of the hamiltonian theory , the property of being fc or second class is essential for the dynamical interpretation of constraints .",
    "we have seen that ( in a regular theory ) any weakly vanishing quantity is strongly equal to a linear combination of constraints .",
    "therefore , if the quantity @xmath124 is fc , it satisfies the strong equality @xmath127 . from this one can infer , by virtue of the jacoby identity , that the poisson bracket of two fc constraints is also fc .",
    "the quantities @xmath128 and @xmath129 in @xmath130 are fc .",
    "thus , the number of independent functions of time @xmath131 in @xmath130 is equal to the number of independent primary fc constraints @xmath129 .",
    "the presence of arbitrary multipliers in the equations of motion ( and their solutions ) means that the variables @xmath132 can not be uniquely determined from given initial values @xmath133 ; therefore , they do not have a direct physical meaning .",
    "physical informations about a system can be obtained from functions @xmath134 , defined on constraint surface , that are independent of arbitrary multipliers ; such functions are called ( classical ) _ observables_. the physical state of a system at time @xmath135 is determined by the complete set of observables at that time .    in order to illustrate these ideas ,",
    "let us consider a general dynamical variable @xmath136 at @xmath137 , and its change after a short time interval @xmath138 .",
    "the initial value @xmath139 is determined by @xmath133 .",
    "the value of @xmath136 at time @xmath138 can be calculated from the equations of motion : @xmath140 .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath131 in @xmath130 are completely arbitrary , we can take different values for these coefficients and obtain different values for @xmath141 , the difference being of the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",
    "this change of @xmath141 is unphysical , as @xmath144 and @xmath145 correspond to the same physical state .",
    "we come to the conclusion that primary fc constraints generate unphysical transformations of dynamical variables , known as _ gauge transformations _",
    ", that do not change the physical state of the system .",
    "similarly , one can conclude that the quantity @xmath146 is also the generator of unphysical transformations .",
    "since @xmath129 s are fc constraints , their pb is strongly equal to a linear combinations of fc constraints .",
    "we expect that this linear combination contains also secondary fc constraints , and this is really seen to be the case in practice",
    ". therefore , secondary fc constraints are also the generators of unphysical transformations .",
    "these considerations do not allow us to conclude that _ all _ secondary fc constraints generate unphysical transformations .",
    "dirac believed that this is true , but was unable to prove it (  dirac s conjecture \" ) .",
    "the final answer to this long standing problem has been given by castellani @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics based on @xmath130 is known to be _ equivalent _ to the related lagrangian dynamics .",
    "we have seen that gauge transformations , generated by fc constraints , do not change the physical state of a system .",
    "this suggests the possibility of generalizing the equations of motion by allowing _",
    "any _ evolution of dynamical variables that does not change physical states .",
    "to realize this idea one can introduce the extended hamiltonian , h_e = h + v^a_a+^b_b , containing both primary ( @xmath147 ) and secondary ( @xmath148 ) fc constraints . here , all the gauge freedom is manifestly present in the dynamics , and any difference between primary and secondary fc constraints is completely absent .",
    "the equations of motion following from @xmath149 are _ not equivalent _ with the euler ",
    "lagrange equations , but the difference is unphysical .",
    "the presence of second class constraints in the theory means that there are dynamical degrees of freedom that are of no importance . in order to be able to eliminate such variables",
    "it is necessary to set up a new pb referring only to dynamically important degrees of freedom .    after finding all fc constraints @xmath150 @xmath151 , the remaining constraints @xmath152 @xmath153 are second class , and",
    "the matrix @xmath154 is nonsingular .",
    "the new pb is called the dirac bracket , \\ { f , g}^*=\\ { f , g}-\\ { f,_r}^-1_rs\\{_s , g } , and it satisfies all the standard properties of a pb .    the dirac bracket of any second class constraint with an arbitrary variable vanishes by construction .",
    "this means that after the dirac brackets are constructed , second class constraints can be treated as strong equations .",
    "the equations of motion ( 3.5 ) can be written in terms of the dirac brackets as @xmath155 .",
    "gauge symmetries describe unphysical transformations of dynamical variables .",
    "this fact can be used to impose suitable restrictions on the set of dynamical variables , so as to bring them into a 11 correspondence with the set of all observables . by means of that procedure",
    "one can remove unobservable gauge freedom in the description of dynamical variables , without changing any observable property of the theory .",
    "the restrictions are realized as a suitable set of gauge conditions : _a ( q , p)0 ( a=1,2, ... ,n_gc ) .",
    "the number of gauge conditions must be equal to the number of independent gauge transformations . in the extended hamiltonian formalism @xmath156 .",
    "first and second class constraints , together with gauge conditions , define a subspace @xmath157 of the phase space @xmath83 , having dimension @xmath158 , in which the dynamics of independent degrees of freedom is realized .",
    "this counting of independent degrees of freedom is gauge independent , hence it holds also in the total hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the presence of arbitrary multipliers in @xmath130 is a signal of the existence of gauge symmetries in the theory .",
    "the general method for constructing the generators of such symmetries has been developed by castellani @xcite .",
    "we are considering a theory determined by the total hamiltonian and a complete set of constraints @xmath159 .",
    "suppose that we have a trajectory @xmath160 , that starts from a point @xmath161 in @xmath119 , and satisfies the equations of motion with some fixed functions @xmath162 .",
    "consider now a new trajectory @xmath163 , that starts from the same point @xmath164 , and satisfies the equations of motion with new functions @xmath165 .",
    "transition from one to the other trajectory at the same moment of time represents an unphysical or gauge transformation ( figure 2 ) .",
    "if gauge transformations are given in terms of arbitrary parameters @xmath166 and their first time derivatives @xmath167 , as is the case with poincar gauge symmetry , the gauge generators have the form g= ( t)g_0 + ( t)g_1 , where phase space functions @xmath168 and @xmath169 satisfy the conditions g_1&&=c_pfc , + g_0+\\ { g_1,h_t}&&=c_pfc , + \\ { g_0,h_t}&&=c_pfc , and",
    "@xmath170 denotes primary fc constraint .",
    "these conditions clearly define the procedure for constructing the generator : one starts with an arbitrary primary fc constraint @xmath169 , evaluates its pb with @xmath130 , and defines @xmath168 in accordance with @xmath171 .",
    "a detailed analysis , based on castellani s algorithm , shows that in all relevant physical applications dirac s conjecture remains true .",
    "this is of particular importance for the standard quantization methods , which are based on the assumption that all fc constraints are gauge generators .",
    "field theory can be thought of as a mechanical system in which dynamical variables are defined at each point @xmath172 of a three  dimensional space , @xmath173 @xmath174 , i.e. where each index takes on also continuous values , @xmath175 .",
    "then , a formal generalization of the previous analysis to the case of field theory becomes rather direct .",
    "we now discuss the simple but important example of electrodynamics , which is in many aspects similar to the theory of gravity .",

    "the existence of extra fc constraints @xmath379 may be interpreted as a consequence of the fact that the velocities contained in @xmath350 and @xmath351 appear at most linear in the lagrangian and , consequently , remain arbitrary functions of time .",

    "however , his arguments concerning the necessity of the time gauge are not acceptable : it is clear that this gauge may be useful , but certainly not essential .",
    "after fixing the time gauge , he found the hamiltonian and derived the related set of constraints ( which is not complete ) , but was unable to calculate the constraint algebra unless imposing another gauge condition .",
