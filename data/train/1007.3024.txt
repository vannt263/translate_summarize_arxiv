    "the present paper deals with the solvability of certain `` large '' systems of partial differential equations ( pdes ) that appear naturally when one considers the problem of inducing a quadratic form on a given distribution , where the term _ large _ refers to the fact that these systems contain much more unknowns than equations .",
    "our work is partly inspired by earlier works ( @xcite ) , all of them related , in different guises , to the general program of inducing geometric structures developed , among many methods for solving the isometric immersion problem , by m. gromov in his seminal book  @xcite .    to trace the origin of this theory , we must go back to the work of nash who showed  @xcite that every compact @xmath6 riemannian manifold can be isometrically immersed in @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this fundamental result has been substantially improved and refined by several authors @xcite . in particular , the hard analytical part of nash s original proof ( based on a powerful technique generalizing the classical implicit function theorem ) was taken up by gromov who stated a _ nash - type implicit function _",
    "theorem for a certain class of differential operators called _ infinitesimally invertible operators _",
    "( for the exact statement , see  @xcite , p. 117 ) .",
    "this is a result which , besides its importance in itself ( it serves as a basis to develop the whole of m. gromov s method based on @xmath9-prinviple ) , represents the starting point to afford the study of many problems about the possibility of inducing arbitrary geometric structures .    0.3 cm in this paper",
    ", @xmath1 will always denote a @xmath10 smooth manifold of dimension @xmath11 with metric @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath6 immersion @xmath14 and let @xmath15 be the canonical euclidean metric on @xmath7 .",
    "the map @xmath16 induces on @xmath1 a metric tensor given in local coordinates by : @xmath17 here and throughout the paper we write the above pull - back @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the _ metric - inducing operator _ , viewed as a map between the space @xmath21 of smooth maps @xmath22 and the space @xmath23 of smooth quadratic differential forms @xmath24 on @xmath1 .",
    "these function spaces will always be considered equipped with the @xmath6-fine ( also called whitney ) topology . recall that , if the manifold @xmath1 is compact , the whitney topology coincides with the ordinary @xmath6 topology .    placed in this setting , the isometric immersion problem @xcite asks for a solution @xmath16 to the ( inducing ) equation @xmath25 which , in local coordinates , requires to solve , for a given positive - definite symmetric matrix of functions @xmath26 on @xmath1 , the system    @xmath27    which consists of @xmath28 equations in the @xmath4 unknowns @xmath29 .",
    "one of the main steps in the original proof of nash s isometric immersion theorem amounts to inverting algebraically the linearized equations corresponding to the system  ( [ eq : isomeq ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the same idea applies to many other instances of nonlinear pdes of geometric nature , which , following the general approach indicated in  @xcite can be locally solved after an appropriate infinite dimensional implicit function theorem is established to pass from ( solutions of ) the linearized system to ( solutions of ) the non - linear system .",
    "once this first step is done , the efficency of gromov s method allows to derive specific ( local ) statements as direct corollaries of the generalized theorem just by specializing , to the pertinent differential operator , the basic properties of infinitesimally invertible operators and the consequent analytical results ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the formulation of gromov s generalized implicit function theorem we need for our application is stated below ( see  @xcite ) :    let @xmath30 be a @xmath6 differential operator which is infinitesimally invertible over some open subset @xmath31 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath32 to @xmath33 is an open map .",
    "the formal definition of infinitesimally invertible operator is omitted here as it requires elaborate preliminaries ( see  @xcite , p.115 - 116 ) . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to say that an operator is infinitesimally invertible if its linearization is invertible .    in the case of the metric inducing operator , the class of those maps to",
    "which theorem ift is applicable consists of the maps called _ free _ by nash . recall that an immersion @xmath34 is said to be _ free _",
    "if for all @xmath35 the @xmath36 vectors @xmath37 are linearly independent ( clearly a necessary condition for the existence of free maps @xmath22 is that @xmath38 ) .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite , p.116 ) _ the metric inducing operator @xmath30 is infinitesimally invertible over the set of free maps @xmath39_.    the next result , which follows by a straightforward application of thom s transversality theorem is also due to nash ( @xcite ) ( compare @xcite , p.33 ) .",
    "a generic map @xmath39 is free for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "( the above means that free maps are open and dense among all @xmath42-maps for @xmath40 ) .",
    "let us turn now to the subject matter of the present paper , where we are given a @xmath43-dimensional distribution @xmath3 on a @xmath11-dimensional smooth manifold @xmath1 .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the space of quadratic differential forms on @xmath3 and by @xmath45 the ( open ) sub - set of the positive ones , i.e. the set of smooth riemannian metrics on @xmath3 .",
    "we are concerned with the following question .",
    "assume that there exists a smooth map @xmath46 which induces on @xmath1 a metric @xmath47 ( from the canonical euclidean metric @xmath48 on @xmath7 ) .",
    "this means that : @xmath49 which can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the partial differential operator defined by : @xmath52    we shall be interested in seeing whether the same is true for any other @xmath53 close enough to @xmath54 , namely if the inducing equation @xmath55 is solvable in a neighbourhood of @xmath54 . in different words ,",
    "we want to find an open neighbourhood @xmath56 of @xmath54 which is contained in the image of @xmath57 .    the above equation  ( [ eq : d_h(f)=g ] ) is easily seen to be equivalent to a system of pdes which is , for any metric @xmath58 on @xmath1 , a subsystem of  ( [ eq : isomeq ] ) .",
    "this is the reason for calling _ partial isometry _",
    "between @xmath59 and @xmath60 any map @xmath61 which is a solution of  ( [ eq : d_h(f)=g ] ) .",
    "it can be useful to notice that , since the map @xmath16 is not necessarily an immersion , unlike in the case of isometries the quadratic form @xmath19 is not required to be positive - definite on the whole @xmath62 .    to answer the above question we have to study the linearization of the operator @xmath57 .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : free ] , where we introduce the notion of @xmath3-free map @xmath63 and prove , for the operator @xmath57 , the analogous of theorems  n1 and  n2 .",
    "this is theorem  [ thm : generichfree ] . as a corollary ( see theorem  [ thm : nghfree ] ) we obtain that the restriction of @xmath57 to the set of @xmath3-free maps is an open map .    as we shall see from the very definition of @xmath3-freedom , the condition @xmath64 is necessary ( but not sufficient ) for the existence of @xmath3-free maps @xmath63 .",
    "it is then natural to look for explicit expressions of @xmath3-free maps when @xmath65 .",
