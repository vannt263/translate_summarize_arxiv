    "the nature of galaxy redshifts has usually been interpreted as due to a general expansion of the universe .",
    "however widely accepted clear experimental proof of this fundamental assumption of most cosmological models has been lacking . the main argument in favor of expansion is the observed nearly perfect blackbody energy distribution of the cosmic background radiation ( mather et al . 1990 , peebles et al .",
    "the tolman surface brightness test ( tolman 1930 ) fundamentally probes for expansion as well , but implementation of this test has proven difficult ( sandage & perelmutter 1991 , pahre et al .",

    "the interpretation of redshifts as due to universal expansion has been questioned ( e.g. arp 1987 , arp et al .",
    "observations of the apparent clustering of high - redshift quasars around low - redshift galaxies ( burbidge et al .",
    "1971 , arp 1987 ) and the anomalous distribution of redshifts in groups ( arp 1994 ) have been used to argue against cosmological expansion .",
    "a theory linking observed redshifts to the ages of the objects has been developed to explain these findings ( narlikar & arp 1993 ) .",
    "a direct test of the nature of cosmological redshifts is provided by the observable effects of time dilation on time variable phenomena at large redshifts . in an expanding universe",
    "these redshifts are directly related to the change in the scale parameter inducing a change of distant clock rates for a local observer .",
    "the light curve of a distant supernova is predicted to be stretched in the observer s frame by a factor @xmath1 compared to the rest frame of the object ( wilson 1939 , rust 1974 , colgate 1979 , tammann 1979 , leibundgut 1990 , hamuy et al .",
    "although the light curves of nearby events display , in general , a fairly uniform shape ( barbon et al .",
    "1973 , leibundgut 1988 ) , recent high - precision photometry shows that sne  ia exhibit differences in their light curves which are related to their luminosities ( phillips 1993 , hamuy et al .",
    "1995 , riess et al .",
    "1995a ) .    to observe the real effect one needs a well observed , spectroscopically classified sn  ia at a considerable redshift and a thorough understanding of the varieties of light curve shapes .",

    "the light curve of the distant sn  1988u was employed for a first test ( @xmath3 ; nrgaard - nielsen et al .",

    "the close match of the regular b passband with the r filter at redshift 0.48 reduces the k - correction terms to a nearly constant value , independent of the exact color evolution ( kim et al .",

    "the photometry of sn  1995k has been fitted to the light curves of the local events by means of @xmath5 minimization .",
    "we find that the simplest possible hypothesis fits the facts best : sn  1995k has the spectrum and the light curve of a normal sn  ia , stretched in time by a factor ( 1 + 0.479 ) .",
    "we could hope to find a close relative of sn  1995k in the sample of nearby sne  ia by determining the best fitting case , very similar to the procedure employed by hamuy et al .",
    "the results of simultaneous fits to the rest frame b and v photometry are presented in table  1 .",
    "as can be seen , the best fit is achieved for the template light curve of sn  1991 t .",
    "however , no clear trend emerges and all fits are quite acceptable .",
    "the dates and magnitudes at maximum found in the comparisons agree with each other to within the errors .",
    "this is an encouraging result as it means we are able to determine these values fairly accurately independently of the assumptions about the comparison light curve .",
    "conversely , it indicates the small differences among the comparison templates near maximum .",
    "the variations in @xmath5 of the best fits for the different templates are largely determined by the observations made well before and well after peak .",
    "the sigmas are the formal errors from the fit and only include the photometric uncertainties of the data .",
    "systematic errors certainly increase the uncertainty on the peak magnitudes .    to demonstrate the robustness of the result , we can estimate the redshift of sn  1995k from the photometry through the redshift dependence of the light curve stretching .",
    "the results of this analysis is shown in the upper panel of figure  1 .",
    "the deduced redshift changes with the assumed light curve shape .",
    "interestingly , the formally best fits appear to prefer a slow supernova at a somewhat smaller redshift than determined from the spectra , although the differences are small .",
    "a zero redshift is clearly excluded in all fits .",
    "the light curves of sn  1995k are certainly consistent with the ones of regular sne  ia assuming a time dilation as expected from universal expansion .",
    "to investigate time dilation in a more general manner , we have performed fits with a parameterized dilation factor of the form @xmath6 . however , the data do not constrain the problem enough to fit both parameters simultaneously .",
    "the analysis was performed in such a way that we determined the global @xmath5 of the fit by varying one parameter while keeping the other at the expected value ( 0.479 for z and 1 for @xmath7 ) .",
    "the lower panel in figure  1 display the results of this analysis .",
    "values of @xmath8 introduce additional light curve stretching and a compression for @xmath9 .",
    "we find that for comparisons with slower local supernovae , the sn  1995k light curve is too fast for the regular dilation factor .",
    "the faster light curves reach values closer to 1 as they need a larger stretching factor to match the sn  1995k photometry .",
    "independent fits employing the light curve shape fitting method developed by riess et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) confirm this result .",
    "this method is based on a set of known light curve shapes and interpolates between them .",
    "it further uses a weighing scheme for the model points which gives more importance to brighter peak magnitudes and larger uncertainties to the fainter parts of the light curve .",
    "this is the reason for the higher @xmath5 of this fit and the much shallower minimum in the @xmath5 distribution .",

    "redshift in this case is caused by tired light or an equivalent theory ( e.g. the variable mass hypothesis ; narlikar & arp 1993 ) and is linked to distance through analyses such as the expanding photospheres in type ii supernovae ( schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ) and gravitational lenses ( dar 1991 ) .",
    "another manifestation is the redshift - apparent magnitude diagram of brightest cluster galaxies ( e.g. postman & lauer 1995 ) and sne  ia .",
    "the small scatter in the hubble diagram of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) supports this redshift - distance relation .",
    "table  2 lists the fit parameters for the non - dilated light curve shapes .",
    "the global @xmath5 values clearly exclude these fits . none of the known light curves of local sne  ia is slow enough to match the photometry of sn  1995k ( figure  2 ) .",
    "in particular the maximum magnitude is far from the observed one due to the attempt of the fits to match the pre - maximum point .",
    "the formal errors of the fit parameters are not valid , as can be judged from large @xmath5 .",
    "if we take a static universe literally , then sn  1995k was observed at an earlier phase ( 16 days before maximum ) than any nearby supernova . in that case",
    "we are depending on extrapolated pre - maximum points in the template light curves , which may not be correct .",
    "therefore we have removed the pre - maximum point from the sn  1995k photometry and compared it again with light curves of local sne  ia .",
    "the quality of the fits improves dramatically ( figure  2 ) . the maximum date and magnitude",
    "agree much better with the observations .",
    "slower light curves are clearly favored in this picture .",
    "nevertheless , even the slowest local templates are qualitatively worse than dilated light curves ; the evolution of sn  1995k was considerably slower than any of the comparison curves .",
    "figure 2 shows the rest - frame b light curve of sn  1995k compared to the best fits of light curves stretched by the expected factor @xmath1 for universal expansion and for non - dilated templates .",
    "two fits for the non - dilated case are shown which emphasize the importance of the pre - maximum observation .",
    "the figure demonstrates that without time dilation effects , sn  1995k must be a unique event unrelated to the observational data of local sne  ia .",
    "when we assume universal expansion , sn  1995k appears as a rather normal sn  ia .",
    "the spectrum shows great similarities to local events which are regarded as non - peculiar , the color at maximum ( @xmath11 ) is similar to unreddened nearby sne  ia , indicating little if any absorption , and the luminosity is in the range expected from expanding cosmologies ( schmidt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the light curve in itself indicates a redshift which is close to the spectroscopic redshift . complicating the analysis is the variety of light curve shapes observed for nearby sne  ia .",
    "this effect has been interpreted as an apparent stretching of an underlying basic template ( perlmutter et al .",
    "however , we know from detailed analysis that the light curve behavior is more complicated ( riess et al",
    ". 1995a ) . the data of sn  1995k ,",
    "unfortunately , can not distinguish which local supernova provides the best match .",
    "we find the formally best fits to indicate a slightly lower redshift or , equivalently , a slightly retarded cosmological expansion .",
    "all fits are determined very strongly by the pre - maximum observation and the latest data points .",
    "this highlights the importance for extended coverage of sn  ia events to perform this time dilation test .",
    "in addition , the photometric accuracy of the data critically determines the goodness of the fits .    in a static universe",
    "the hubble constant is time - independent and just measures the redshift - distance proportionality . for a conventional hubble constant of @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13",
    "one unit in redshift corresponds to 6000  mpc . the same number for @xmath14  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 is 3750  mpc .",
    "the luminosity of sn  1995k in such a static universe is @xmath15 .",
    "our best estimate for the absolute magnitude sn  1995k should have when we use the decline rate relation of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , however , is @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and the most conservative estimate of the decline - luminosity relation ( eq .",
    "11 of hamuy et al .",
    "this means sn  1995k should be about 1 magnitude more luminous than what would be observed in a static universe model .",
    "note that the extrapolation goes well beyond the set of objects on which the method is based ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "even compared to the average absolute magnitude of local supernovae ( @xmath19 ) sn  1995k appears underluminous . in a static universe , sn  1995k would have been a truly unique sn  ia - exhibiting the slowest known photometric evolution , yet displaying a normal spectrum , and being substantially less luminous than its nearby counterparts .",
    "the apparent peak magnitude of sn  1995k can also be compared to the expectation of a steady - state model .",
    "since the universe is expanding in this model , time dilation can not distinguish it from the standard big bang .",
    "however , the steady - state model predicts a luminosity - redshift relation . with the sample of nearby sne  ia compiled by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) we can predict the expected apparent magnitude of a distant supernova given its redshift . with equation ( 9 ) from hamuy et al .",
    ", i.e. excluding any luminosity corrections from the light curve shape , we predict a peak magnitude of sn  1995k of b=@xmath20 where the error is composed from the uncertainty in the determination of the zero - point ( cf .",
    "difference between eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 9 ) in hamuy et al . ) .",
    "the scatter of the local supernovae around the relation is @xmath21 .",
    "sn  1995k was observed about 0.4  magnitude brighter than this prediction . with this single measurement",
    "we are thus not able to exclude the steady - state model due to the intrinsic scatter in the luminosity of sne  ia .",
    "the photometry of sn  1995k extending over about 50 days provides sufficient data to probe the effect of time dilation on a clock running at a cosmological distance .",
    "we find that including the time dilation expected from universal expansion makes sn  1995k comparable to local sne  ia and a fair representative of its class .",
    "the spectrum , color , luminosity at maximum , and the light curve shape are all very similar to what is observed in local type ia supernova . together with more sne  ia at cosmological distances",
    "it can be used to determine the deceleration parameter and contributions of non - baryonic mass to the cosmic mass density .    on the other hand , assuming a static universe , sn  1995k had the slowest photometric evolution of all known sne  ia despite appearing spectroscopically indistinguishable from local events .",
    "the photometry of sn  1995k can not be approximated by any light curve shape of nearby events and , in a non - expanding universe , does also not follow the decline - luminosity relation established for nearby events .",
    "it is even less luminous than the mean of local supernovae and would constitute a unique and peculiar sn  ia .",
    "we take this as a clear vindication of an expanding universe .",
    "further supernovae at redshifts beyond 0.1 provide additional checks ( cf .",
    "goldhaber et al . 1996 ) .",
    "such distant objects are currently discovered at a regular rate ( perlmutter et al .",

    "it is only these observations which provide enough leverage to perform this test .",
    "the early and late phase photometry is also of paramount importance for an accurate determination of the deceleration parameter @xmath22 in order to identify the best local counterpart and find the most appropriate luminosity .",
