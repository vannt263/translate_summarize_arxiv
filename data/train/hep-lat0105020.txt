    "this seems to be a reasonable estimate since other methods of estimation , either shifting the matching scale from @xmath76 to @xmath141 or employing different choices of gauge coupling such as ( [ eqn : coupling - p ] ) , give a small variation of @xmath205 .",
    "adding the two estimates by quadrature gives a 3.3% systematic error , and we obtain @xmath206 as our estimate of the continuum value of @xmath0 in the @xmath207 scheme at @xmath77  gev .",

    "we recall that the statistical error with the kogut - susskind results are at the @xmath209% level .",
    "a significantly larger error of 6.7% in the continuum value arises from the continuum extrapolation incorporating both the @xmath210 scaling violation and the @xmath211 uncertainty due to the use of one - loop renormalization factor . making a more detailed check of agreement of results from the two types of quark actions requires a better control of systematic errors , in particular those due to renormalization factors .",
    "for this purpose non - perturbative determination of these factors for both cases will be necessary .    the rbc collaboration carried out a quenched simulation with the domain - wall quark action and a plaquette gluon action at @xmath212 ( @xmath213  gev ) on a @xmath214 lattice .",

    "our data , in fact , allows us to examine the scaling behavior of @xmath0 over a wide range of quark mass , and derive the mass dependence of @xmath0 in the continuum limit .    in order to compare results at different lattice spacings , we employ @xmath71 in physical units ( gev@xmath216 ) instead of @xmath152 . in fig .",

    "one can see that the contribution from higher order terms in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath222 and @xmath223 ) is non - negligible and becomes as large as 40% of the leading order contribution ( @xmath63 ) at @xmath224 .",
    "we attempt a determination of light quark masses @xmath225 and @xmath70 using our meson mass data .",
    "there is a difficulty associated with a non - zero pseudo scalar meson mass at @xmath153 due to finite spatial sizes , which is represented by @xmath169 in the linear chiral formula ( [ eq : pion ] ) .",
    "this causes systematic uncertainties in the results for quark masses , which is quite sizable for light @xmath157 and @xmath62 quarks .    in order to examine this problem",
    ", we calculate the physical quark masses in two ways which differ in the choice of origin for bare quark mass . in the first method",
    "we take @xmath153 as the origin , and write @xmath226 here @xmath158 and @xmath161 are the bare quark mass @xmath24 for the physical point of pion and kaon determined by ( [ eq : udquark ] ) and ( [ eq : squark ] ) .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath158 in the second equation is to take into account the contribution of @xmath157-@xmath62 quark in the kaon mass , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 denotes the renormalization factor to match the bare lattice value to that in the continuum in the @xmath9 scheme with ndr at @xmath77  gev as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : renormalization ] .    in the second case",
    "we take the point @xmath229 , where pseudo scalar meson mass vanishes , as the origin .",

    "[ fig : ml - v ] we plot the @xmath157-@xmath62 quark mass calculated in the two ways above as a function of spatial size @xmath232 in physical units .",
    "two features are quite evident from this figure : ( i ) there is little dependence on the fifth dimensional size @xmath5 .",
    "hence @xmath46 is sufficient to avoid effects of chiral symmetry breaking at our range of lattice spacings .",
    "( ii ) effects of finite spatial size , by contrast , are quite significant if @xmath169 is ignored , even yielding a negative value for @xmath69 for small spatial sizes ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ml - v ] ) .",
    "the values calculated including @xmath169 , on the other hand , are much more stable as a function of @xmath232 ( right panel ) .    in order to understand the second point",
    ", we note that @xmath233 depends strongly on the volume while the slope @xmath234 is almost volume independent . using ( [ eq : udquark ] ) and the corresponding one at @xmath235 given by @xmath236 and neglecting a small volume dependence of the denominator @xmath237 , we observe that the following formula holds : @xmath238 since the magnitude @xmath239  mev for our spatial size of @xmath240  fm is comparable to the actual @xmath157-@xmath62 quark mass , the first term is @xmath241 and becomes the main contribution to the size effect , while the second term , representing finite size effect in the slope @xmath234 , is found to be much smaller . hence including @xmath169 removes a dominant part of finite size effects in @xmath157-@xmath62 quark mass . in view of this situation",

    "compared to the values obtained with the 4-dimensional quark actions , our results with the domain - wall action are somewhat small both for @xmath157-@xmath62 and @xmath58 quark . as with the case of @xmath0 , a more precise examination of the issue of agreement of the continuum value",
    "requires a non - perturbative determination of the renormalization factors for our combination of quark and gluon actions .",

    "in this article we have presented our investigation of quenched calculation of the kaon b parameter @xmath0 with domain - wall qcd .    in order to make full use of the good chiral property of this system , we employed a renormalization - group improved gluon action and carried out simulations at @xmath249  gev . according to our previous study@xcite , the magnitude of chiral symmetry breaking due to finite fifth dimensional size @xmath5 , if measured in terms of residual quark mass @xmath33 , is less than 1  mev for @xmath250 at such lattice spacings . an explicit examination of the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath0 has shown that such effect is less than 1% for @xmath251 at @xmath249  gev .",
    "we have also found that spatial size effects are less than 1% for the physical spatial sizes @xmath252  fm , confirming the finding of a previous study with the kogut - susskind quark action .",
    "furthermore , scaling violation turned out to be very small , being less than 2% between @xmath3  gev and 3  gev .",
    "these results show that dwqcd , albeit computer time consuming by a factor @xmath253 compared to conventional lattice qcd simulations , provides a very good framework for a precision determination of @xmath0 .",
