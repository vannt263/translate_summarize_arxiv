    "one of the big challenges of 21st century astrophysics is to understand the magnetism of the sun , and in so doing to develop the tools needed for the exploration of the magnetic activity in other types of stars across the hertzsprung - russel diagram . a crucial step toward this goal",
    "is to decipher the magnetic structure of the upper chromosphere , the key interface region between the underlying ( cooler ) photosphere and the overlying ( hotter ) corona where dominance of the physics passes from hydrodynamic to magnetic forces ( e.g. , the review by harvey 2006 ) . to this end , we need :    * to identify observables sensitive to the magnetic fields of the upper chromosphere and transition region ; * to develop suitable diagnostic tools to infer the magnetic field from those observables ; * to design and build the telescopes and instrumentation needed for measuring the observables .",
    "the upper chromosphere is indeed a very important part of the sun because all of the plasma , magnetic field and energy in the corona and solar wind are supplied through this key boundary region .",
    "the observables that contain information on the physical conditions of this region are mainly spectral lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and far - uv ( fuv ) spectral range , with ly@xmath0 being the most prominent line . the intensity profile ( i.e. , the stokes @xmath1 profile ) of ly@xmath0 and other lines of the lyman series",
    "have been measured on the solar disk by several instruments on board rockets and space - based telescopes ( e.g. , roussel - dupr 1982 ; warren et al .",
    "these measurements show that when observed on the solar disk the hydrogen lyman lines are always in emission , and that the emission originates in the upper chromosphere and transition region .",
    "interestingly , high - resolution ly@xmath0 _ intensity _ images of quiet - sun regions taken with the very high angular resolution ultraviolet telescope ( vault ) sounding rocket show a forest of elongated fibrils suggesting closed magnetic loops in the upper chromosphere ( vourlidas et al .",
    "however , no quantitative information on the magnetic fied of the upper solar atmosphere can be obtained from this type of observations because the intensity profile of ly@xmath0 and of many other transition region lines is practically insensitive to the strength , inclination and azimuth of the magnetic field vector .",
    "the only way to obtain quantitative empirical information on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field is through the measurement and interpretation of the polarization that some physical mechanisms introduce in spectral lines .",
    "unfortunately , the familiar zeeman effect is of little practical interest for the  measurement \" of magnetic fields in the upper chromosphere and transition region ( except perhaps in sunspots ) because the circular polarization ( stokes @xmath2 ) scales with the ratio , @xmath3 , between the zeeman splitting and the doppler line - width and the linear polarization ( stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) scales with @xmath6 ; this ratio is very small for the uv and fuv lines that originate in the weakly magnetized plasma of the upper solar chromosphere because @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 the wavelength , @xmath9 the magnetic strength and @xmath10 the kinetic temperature ; see landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) .",
    "fortunately , there is yet another physical mechanism by means of which the magnetic fields of a stellar atmosphere leave fingerprints in the spectral line polarization : the hanle effect .",
    "the absorption of _ anisotropic _ radiation produces atomic level alignment ( i.e. , the individual magnetic substates of levels with angular momentum @xmath11 are unevenly populated , in such a way that the populations of sublevels with different values of @xmath12 are different and , moreover , quantum coherences between them may appear ) .",
    "this , in turn , gives rise to linear polarization in the spectral line under consideration ( e.g. , trujillo bueno 2001 ) .",
    "the hanle effect due to the presence of a magnetic field inclined with respect to the symmetry axis of the pumping radiation field modifies the atomic level alignment and the linear polarization of the spectral line radiation .",
    "approximately , the emergent linear polarization is sensitive to magnetic strengths between 0.2@xmath13 and 5@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the critical hanle field ( in g ) for which the zeeman splitting of the line s level under consideration is similar to its natural width ( with @xmath15 the level s radiative lifetime , in seconds , and @xmath16 its land factor ) .",
    "note that @xmath17 g for ly@xmath0 , @xmath18 g for ly@xmath19 and @xmath20 g for ly@xmath21 , and that the magnetic sensitivity provided by the hanle effect is independent of the doppler line width .",
    "each lyman line results from two blended transitions between a lower level , with @xmath22 , and two upper levels , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , for each lyman line the only level that can be aligned and contribute to the emergent linear polarization is the upper level with @xmath23 ( when the hyperfine structure of hydrogen is neglected , which is known to be a good approximation for ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "a particularly important question is whether the atomic alignment of the @xmath24 level of ly@xmath0 is significant or , in other words , if the ly@xmath0 radiation that illuminates the hydrogen atoms of the solar atmosphere is sufficiently anisotropic in the line formation region .",
    "obviously , the anisotropy of the incident ly@xmath0 radiation is very significant in the optically thin case of the solar corona observed off - the - limb at large distances above it ( e.g. , trujillo bueno et al .",
    "2005 ; and more references therein ) .",
    "the key question for us here is however whether the ly@xmath0 radiation is sufficiently anisotropic within the solar transition region itself , so as to produce there a significant amount of atomic alignment in the @xmath24 level .",
    "as mentioned above , the lyman radiation that we observe when pointing to the solar disk is produced by the plasma of the solar transition region , which is very optically thick at the central wavelength of ly@xmath0 .",
    "as a matter of fact , the center - to - limb variation ( clv ) of the observed ly@xmath0 intensity is very small or negligible ( e.g. , roussel - dupr 1982 ; curdt et al .",
    "2008 ) , which implies that the intensity of the _ outgoing _ radiation ( i.e. , that propagating outwards ) shows no significant variation with the heliocentric angle @xmath25 .",
    "however , this does not mean that the illumination of the transition region atoms is isotropic  which would imply that the scattering polarization in ly@xmath0 is zero . as we shall see below , the intensity of the _ incoming _ radiation ( i.e. , that propagating inwards ) calculated in semi - empirical and hydrodynamical models of the solar chromosphere shows significant clv , so that the hydrogen atoms of the solar transition region must be illuminated by an anisotropic radiation field .",
    "the main goal of this letter is to show that the linear - polarization amplitude of the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation is predicted to be significant because of the anisotropy of the incoming radiation and that via the hanle effect it is sensitive to the magnetic fields expected for the upper chromosphere and transition region of the sun .",
    "we focus here on ly@xmath0 because it is the most intense line of the solar transition region and also because its polarization is practically insensitive to collisional depolarization there , but we point out that linear polarization due to atomic level alignment is also expected for at least ly@xmath19 and ly@xmath21 .",
    "we have applied the quantum theory of spectral line formation described in chapter 7 of landi deglinnocenti & landolfi ( 2004 ) , which treats the scattering line polarization phenomenon as the temporal successsion of 1st - order absorption and re - emission processes , interpreted as statistically independent events .",
    "this complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) approximation is suitable for reaching the objective of this letter  that is , to estimate the _ line - center _ polarization amplitudes in the absence and in the presence of the hanle effect ( e.g. , sampoorna et al .",
    "2010 , and more references therein ) .",
    "the splitting between the @xmath26 and @xmath24 upper levels of ly@xmath0 is of the order of @xmath27 , which is much larger than the level s natural width ( of the order of @xmath28 ) but much smaller than the line s doppler width ( of the order of @xmath29 ) .",
    "this justifies to neglect quantum interferences between such two @xmath30-levels ( see belluzzi & trujillo bueno 2011 ) .",
    "the upper level @xmath24 , with land factor @xmath31 , is the only level that contributes to the linear polarization of ly@xmath0 when its hyperfine splitting is neglected , which as shown by bommier & sahal - brchot ( 1982 ) is a good approximation .    in order to estimate the linear polarization amplitudes of ly@xmath0 we need to take into account radiative transfer effects in models of the solar atmosphere . to this end , we have chosen both the quiet - sun semi - empirical model of fontenla et al .",
    "( 1993 ; hereafter the fal - c model ) and the chromospheric hydrodynamical model of carlsson & stein ( 1997 ; hereafter the hydrodynamical model ) . the atomic model we have used includes all the fine - structure levels of the first three @xmath32-levels of hydrogen ( that is , it includes ly@xmath19 and h@xmath0 , in addition to ly@xmath0 ) .",
    "we quantify the excitation state of each @xmath30-level by means of the multipolar components of the atomic density matrix , whose self - consistent values at each spatial grid point of the model atmosphere have to be obtained by solving jointly the statistical equilibrium equations for such density - matrix components and the stokes - vector transfer equation for each of the allowed radiative transitions in the atomic model . to this end",
    ", we have applied an efficient and accurate radiative transfer method ( see appendix a of tpn & trujillo bueno 2011 ) .",
    "isotropic collisions with protons and electrons have been also taken into account , as described in appendix b of tpn & trujillo bueno ( 2011 ) .",
    "in particular , the dipolar collisional rates between nearby @xmath30-levels ( i.e. , between levels @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) have been calculated applying the semi - classical impact approximation theory ( e.g. , sahal - brchot et al .",
    "1996 ) , while the inelastic collisional rates between the different @xmath32-levels were taken from przybilla & butler ( 2004 ) .",
    "we have included also the stark broadening of the hydrogen lines , following stehl ( 1996 ) . with these physical ingredients ,",
    "our non - lte syntheses of the hydrogen intensity profiles are in good agreement with those computed by other researchers using more @xmath32-levels .",
    "in the absence of magnetic fields the line - center amplitude of the fractional scattering polarization in the lyman lines can be estimated by applying the following approximate expression ( see trujillo bueno & manso sainz 1999 , and note that the @xmath35 factor here takes into account that two blended transitions contribute to the intensity profile ) :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 for the lyman lines , @xmath38 ( with @xmath25 the heliocentric angle ) , and @xmath39 is the fractional anisotropy of the spectral line radiation calculated at the height in the model atmosphere where the line center optical depth is unity along the line of sight ( los ) . therefore , the key quantity that determines the scattering polarization signals we may expect for the ly@xmath0 line when observing the solar disk is @xmath39 , where    @xmath40    is the familar frequency - integrated mean intensity ( @xmath41 being the normalized absorption profile , with @xmath42 the frequency and @xmath43 the ray direction ) , and    @xmath44\\ , \\label{eq : j20}\\ ] ]    quantifies the anisotropy of the spectral line radiation that illuminates each point of the astrophysical plasma under consideration ( with @xmath45 ) .",
    "partial frequency redistribution expressions for @xmath46 can be found in the paper by sampoorna et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which clarifies that crd is a suitable approximation for estimating the line - center scattering polarization . ] . in solar - like atmospheres",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "( 3 ) plays the dominant role , so @xmath47 if the incident radiation field is predominantly vertical while @xmath48 if it is predominantly horizontal .",
    "the specific intensity depends on the spatial variation of the corresponding source function component , @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath49 decreases with height in the solar atmosphere then the outgoing radiation shows limb darkening ( i.e. , it is predominantly vertical ) , while the incoming radiation shows limb brightening ( i.e. , it is predominantly horizontal ) .",
    "it is the magnitude of the vertical gradient of @xmath49 what determines the sign of @xmath50 ( see fig . 4 of trujillo bueno 2001 ) .",
    "for a constant source function we have that @xmath48 , because in this particular case all outgoing rays have the same intensity and we are left only with the ( predominantly horizontal ) contribution of the incoming radiation .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the spatial variation of @xmath39 for h@xmath0 , ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath19 , calculated in the fal - c model .",
    "note that the anisotropies of the lyman lines are practically zero all through the model atmosphere , except in the model s transition region where they are negative and significant ( i.e. , of the order of a few percent at the atmospheric heights where the line - center optical depth is unity along the los ) .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "1 illustrates that in the model s transition region the ly@xmath0 anisotropy is dominated by the clv of the incoming radiation .",
    "the two panels of fig . 2 show the calculated center - to - limb variation of the emergent @xmath51 profile of the ly@xmath0 line ( hereafter , @xmath52 ) .",
    "the left panel corresponds to the results of our radiative transfer calculations in the semi - empirical fal - c model , while the right panel shows the @xmath52 profiles that result from averaging the time - dependent stokes @xmath53 and @xmath4 profiles calculated in the hydrodynamical simulation model of carlsson & stein ( 1997 ) .",
    "the variation with @xmath54 of the line center amplitude of the @xmath52 profile can be easily understood by using fig .",
    "1 ( right panel ) and eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "remarkably , the amplitude and shape of the @xmath52 profiles calculated in both solar atmospheric models are qualitatively similar ; this re - inforces our conclusion that scattering processes in the solar transition region should indeed produce measurable linear polarization signals in ly@xmath0 .",
    "we point out that the transition region starts at a rather precise height in the fal - c model ( i.e. , at about 2200 km ) , while in the hydrodynamical model it fluctuates with time .",
    "we turn now to estimating the sensitivity of the emergent ly@xmath0 linear polarization to the presence of organized and random magnetic fields in the solar transition region .",
    "since similar conclusions are obtained with the hydrodynamical model , it suffices with showing the results of our self - consistent radiative transfer calculations in the fal - c model atmosphere .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated @xmath52 and @xmath55 signals for a los with @xmath56 , which implies a distance of about 45   from the solar limb . except for the @xmath57 g case ( shown in fig .",
    "3 with a gray dotted line for reference ) , the curves show @xmath52 and @xmath55 for a horizontal ( i.e. , parallel to the solar surface ) magnetic field of 20 g ; the field has a fixed orientation given by the azimuth angle written in the figure panels .",
    "note that both @xmath52 and @xmath55 are sensitive to the azimuth of the magnetic field vector : while the @xmath52 signal changes but remains always negative , the sign of @xmath55 also depends on the azimuth value .",
    "in such close - to - the - limb scattering geometry , @xmath55 would be zero if , instead of having a dominant orientation , the magnetic field azimuth was uniformly distributed within the spatio - temporal resolution element of the observation .",
    "however , away from the solar disk center , @xmath52 remains sensitive to the magnetic field strength even in such an unfavorable situation .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 , which shows how the amplitude of @xmath52 signal decreases as the magnetic strength of a random - azimuth horizontal field increases . as seen in this figure , for the scattering geometry of a close to the limb observation ( e.g. , @xmath56 ) , the hanle effect _",
    "depolarizes_. however , for the forward - scattering geometry of a disk center observation ( i.e. , a los with @xmath58 ) , the hanle effect of an inclined magnetic field with a given orientation _ creates _ linear polarization ( see the right panel of fig .  4 and note that in order to be able to detect the presence of a horizontal magnetic field of 30 g in the bulk of the solar transition region the polarimetric sensitivity of the measurement should be at least 0.1% ) .",
    "therefore , the hanle effect in ly@xmath0 can be used to diagnose the magnetic field all over the solar disk ( i.e. , it is not restricted to an annular region around the solar limb ) .",
    "our radiative transfer investigation in semi - empirical and hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere indicate that the ly@xmath0 line should show measurable linear polarization signals when observing the solar disk . via the hanle effect",
    "the line - center amplitudes turn out to be sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields in the solar transition region , with good sensitivity to field strengths between 10 and 100 g. for such field strengths there is no significant impact of the zeeman effect on the ly@xmath0 radiation .    the above - mentioned prediction is based on the same quantum theory that explains the linear polarization profiles observed in various visible and near - ir lines ( e.g. , manso sainz & trujillo bueno 2003 ; tpn & trujillo bueno 2010 ) .",
    "this crd theory is suitable also for estimating the line - center polarization amplitudes of strong resonance lines like ly@xmath0 , but we point out and advance here that partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) effects do produce interesting and sizable @xmath52 signals in the ly@xmath0 wings ( qualitatively similar to those shown in figure 9 of trujillo bueno 2011 for the mg ii k - line at 2795  ) .",
    "the predicted line - center amplitudes of the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization are smaller than 1% .",
    "nevertheless , with a moderate aperture telescope they can be measured with a polarimetric sensitivity of 0.1% and a spectral resolution of 0.1   by opting for a spatial resolution of the order of 1 arcsecond and a temporal resolution of the order of 1 minute ( e.g. , see the ly@xmath0 polarization sounding rocket project outlined in ishikawa et al .",
    "information on the thermal and magnetic structure of the solar transition region can be obtained from the observed @xmath52 and @xmath55 profiles themselves and through detailed radiative transfer simulations in given atmospheric models .",
    "therefore , it would be worthwhile to develop a spectropolarimeter for measuring from space the linear polarization profiles caused by scattering processes and the hanle effect in the ly@xmath0 line of the solar transition region . unfortunately , the pioneering soviet satellite experiment of stenflo et al .",
    "( 1980 ) failed because the optical transmission of the instrument was severely degraded due to in - orbit contamination from the satellite .",
    "such a development would open up a novel diagnostic window for the exploration of the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere .    *",
