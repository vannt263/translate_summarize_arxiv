    "the study of multiplicative structures on spaces has a long history in algebraic topology . for many spaces of interest",

    "this is analogous to the situation for categories where strictly commutative multiplications rarely occur in practice and the more useful @xmath1 notion is that of a symmetric monoidal structure .",
    "similar remarks apply to multiplicative structures on other types of objects . however , for certain kinds of applications it is desirable to be able to replace @xmath1 structures by strictly commutative ones , and this can sometimes be achieved by modifying the underlying category of objects under consideration .",
    "an example of this is the introduction of modern categories of spectra ( in the sense of stable homotopy theory ) @xcite equipped with symmetric monoidal smash products .",
    "these categories of spectra have homotopy categories equivalent to the usual stable homotopy category but come with refined multiplicative structures allowing the rectification of @xmath1 ring spectra to strictly commutative ring spectra .",

    "likewise there are symmetric monoidal refinements of spaces @xcite allowing for analogous rectifications of @xmath1 structures .",

    "* section  1 ) .",
    "while it is well - known that this construction can not be used to turn braided monoidal categories into categories with a strictly commutative multiplication , we shall see that it can be reinterpreted so as to take values in commutative @xmath2-category monoids instead .",
    "this gives rise to the _ @xmath2-category rectification functor _ @xmath23 introduced in section  [ subsec : rectification ] . in order to obtain an analogous rectification on the space level we apply the results of fiedorowicz - stelzer - vogt  @xcite that show how to associate braided monoidal categories to @xmath0 spaces .",

    "the basic fact ( valid for any commutative monoid in a braided monoidal category whose unit is terminal ) is now that the bar construction applied to @xmath25 is a simplicial monoid and hence can be iterated once to give a bisimplicial @xmath2-space . evaluating the homotopy colimit of this @xmath2-space we get the double delooping .",
    "this construction in fact gives an alternative proof of stasheff s result independent of the operadic recognition theorem for double loop spaces .",
    "another ingredient of our work is a general procedure for constructing equivalences between localized categories that we detail in appendix  [ app : localization ] .",
    "this improves on previous work by fiedorowicz - stelzer - vogt  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  c ) and has subsequently been used by these authors in @xcite to sharpen some of their earlier results .",
    "we begin by introducing the category of braided injections in section  [ sec : braided - injections ] and establish the basic homotopy theory of @xmath2-spaces in section  [ sec : homotopy - b - spaces ] .",
    "then we switch to the categorical setting in section  [ sec : b - categories ] where we prove theorem  [ thm : main - theorem-1 ] . in section  [ sec : e2-spaces ] we return to the analysis of @xmath2-spaces and prove theorem  [ thm : main - theorem-2 ] , whereas section  [ sec : classifying ] is dedicated to double deloopings of commutative @xmath2-space monoids .",
