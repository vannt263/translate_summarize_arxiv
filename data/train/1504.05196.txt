    "after two decades of studying the properties of young brown dwarfs ( bd ) , there is an agreement that these objects and very low mass stars ( vlms ) have similar formation processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although some issues about their early evolution are still matter of intense research .",
    "for instance , it is well accepted that the number fractions of vlms and bd harbouring primordial discs drop off during the first @xmath6 of their evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , there is growing evidence suggesting that the time scale for disc dissipation could depend on stellar mass , because the fraction of objects that retain circumstellar discs increases for those with lower masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a dependency could have remarkable implications on the efficiency for the formation of giant and terrestrial planets around stars of different masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first evidences of such a dependency came from studies in the stellar mass domain .",
    "@xcite found that the inner disc frequency at ages between 3 and 10 @xmath7 in intermediate - mass stars is lower than in low - mass stars and suggested that it could be a consequence of a more efficient mechanism of primordial disc dispersal in the intermediate - mass stars .",
    "these results were subsequently supported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the number fraction of discs surrounding stars in the wide mass range @xmath8 in the upper sco association , finding that the fraction of primordial optically thick discs decreases as the mass of the star increases .",
    "@xcite studied stars with spectral types k6 to m4 in the orion ob1 association and found the maximum of the disc frequency in m0 . in the younger @xmath9 ori",
    "cluster @xcite reported disc fractions of @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "this tendency is also supported by results in the @xmath14 orionis association from @xcite who found a disc fraction of @xmath15 for k - type stars and @xmath16 for m5 stars or later .",
    "the unprecedented capabilities of the spitzer space telescope @xcite and the wise survey @xcite allowed to extend these studies down to the sub - stellar mass domain .",
    "@xcite complemented the results from @xcite for the @xmath9 ori cluster finding that @xmath17 of the bds shows ir excesses consistent with discs .",
    "@xcite studied the tw hya association and found that @xmath18 of the bds show ir excesses , against @xmath19 of the vlms and @xcite suggest that the longer disc lifetimes in tw hya could be a consequence of its lower bd spatial density . in the same region",
    ", @xcite showed that the bds having irradiated accretion discs do not show the silicate emission found in discs around vlms @xcite and in younger vlms and bds .",
    "they interpreted these results as an indication that grain growth occurs more rapidly in discs around bd than in those around stars or that grains grow faster at smaller disc radii as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "particularly , the @xmath20 old upper sco association ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been the subject of several studies about the fraction of bd harboring discs .",
    "@xcite studied vlms and bd with spectral types from m5 to m9 , finding a disc frequency of @xmath21 .",
    "they also reported that @xmath22 of such objects also show h@xmath23 emissions consistent with active accretion .",
    "@xcite compiled all the spectroscopically confirmed bds and identified discs based on wise photometry .",
    "they found a disc frequency of @xmath24 and that half of the vlms and bd harboring discs also show signatures of accretion .",
    "they did not find any dependence of the disc fraction with the stellar number density or the bd / star number ratio and suggested that the differences in disc life times could also be a consequence of different bd formation mechanisms and/or different initial disc fractions . considering the latest age estimate for that region ( @xmath25 ;",
    "* ) , @xcite found that the disc fraction of objects with masses @xmath26 reaches @xmath27 , which indicates that such primordial discs could survive for at least @xmath6 .",
    "recently , in this region , @xcite reported that @xmath28 of the bds are class ii and that @xmath29 are transitional discs .",
    "they also compared their fractions with those for k and m - type stars in upper sco , chai , ic348 and @xmath9 ori ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) and argued that the correlation between the disc fraction and the stellar mass is not statistically significant , and that the average lifetimes of discs around such stars could not depend on the stellar mass . using vista @xcite , irac - spitzer and wise photometry @xcite studied the @xmath0 old 25 orionis group and orion ob1a finding a number fraction of candidates low - mass stars ( lms ) showing ir excesses between @xmath30 and @xmath31 while for bds candidates the number fraction increases up to @xmath32 to @xmath33 .    in summary",
    ", there are several indications on a possible dependence of the characteristic time scale of disc dissipation with stellar mass , that extends down to the sub - stellar mass regime , although some issues related to the estimation of ages and the uncertainties in the number fractions need to be clarified .",
    "these issues could be addressed by studying different disc indicators in slightly more evolved regions ( @xmath34 ) with consistent age estimations .",
    "this , together with the use of numerous samples of lms and bds and a thorough statistical treatment , can provide a robust analysis of the variations of disk fractions with age .",
    "in this paper we present an optical spectroscopic and optical / near - ir photometric study of 15 bds with masses @xmath35 ( spectral types between m6 and m9 ) , together with the sample of 77 lms with masses @xmath36 ( spectral types between m0.5 to m5.5 ) from @xcite .",
    "these 15 bds were spectroscopically confirmed as members of the 25 orionis group and its surroundings in orion ob1a , from an initial sample of 21 bd candidates .",
    "these regions have an age of @xmath0 , estimated from lms and bd samples @xcite , all of which are consistent .",
    "we obtain the disc number fractions of bd and lms from two different indicators : ir - excesses and spectroscopic signatures of ongoing accretion .",
    "we compute the fractions on both sides of the sub - stellar mass limit following the same procedure , and provide a statistically robust treatment that allows us to compute the probability that the disc fractions of lms and bd are different .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ observations ] we define the sample and describe the photometric database , the spectroscopic observations and data reduction .",
    "the membership diagnoses are discussed in section [ memberships ] . in section [ discs ]",
    "we classify the new members as class ii , evolved discs and class iii according to the ir photometric signatures . in section [ accretion ]",
    "we analyse the spectroscopic signatures of accretion and classify the new bds as classic t tauri star ( ctts ) or weak t tauri star ( wtts ) sub - stellar analogous . in section [ objects ]",
    "we comment on particular objects and the discussion and conclusions are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "for the present work we studied 21 targets from the sample of photometric bd candidates with expected spectral types between m6 and l1 , obtained during the survey of the 25 orionis group and its surroundings carried out by @xcite .",
    "the candidate selection was performed based on their position in colour - magnitude diagrams that combine i - band optical photometry from the cida deep survey of orion ( cdso , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near ir photometry in the j , h and ks bands from the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have carried out the spectroscopic observations of the 21 candidates with the osiris instrument @xcite at the gran telescopio de canarias ( gtc ) .",
    "the 21 candidates analysed in this work were selected as follows : first we chose 16 candidates with photometric colours consistent with members of orion with spectral types m7 to l1 .",
    "these were randomly selected from the full catalog of bd candidates , i.e. without imposing any further cuts that might bias the sample towards objects harbouring discs . out of these 16 candidates ,",
    "5 objects had another m6 to m7 candidate at a distance smaller than 7.4@xmath37 , which is close enough to be observed simultaneously with the single long - slit configuration of osiris .",
    "in this way , we obtained the spectra for 21 candidates with estimated spectral types between m6 and l1 , in only 16 observations .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sample with respect to the orion ob1 association is shown in figure  [ ardec ] .",
    "the observations were performed in service mode during march , october and december 2012 and october and november 2013 as part of the guaranteed mexican time with gtc .",
    "we used the osiris spectrograph in the single long - slit configuration with a 1@xmath38 wide slit and the r500r grism , which results in a @xmath39@xmath40 wavelength coverage with a dispersion of 4.88 @xmath41 and a nominal resolution of 587 at 7319  .",
    "sky flats , dome flats , bias frames and several spectra of comparison lamps for wavelength calibration were obtained each night .",
    "the observing log is shown in table [ osirislog ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ physprop ]    we classified the 77 lms from @xcite as ctts or wtts following the same procedure we used for bds .",
    "we find 3 ctts ( spectral types m1 , m1.5 and m5.5 ) and 74 wtts ( spectral types between m0.5 and m5.5 ) corresponding respectively to @xmath4 and @xmath42 which are consistent with the results from @xcite and @xcite in the same region . as we did for the ir excesses , in figure  [ probctts ] we show the probability distribution of the fraction of ctts in the lms and bd mass regimes .",
    "we found that within a @xmath10 margin there are , respectively , probabilities of @xmath43 and @xmath44 that the fractions of ctts and wtts for bds have different values than for lms .",
    "again , these probabilities show that the difference observed in the ctts and wtts fractions obtained for lms and bds has a high statistical significance .     for the fractions of bd and lms classified as ctts.,width=340 ]",
    "we emphasize that from the 5 bds showing accretion signatures , 2 were classified as class ii and 3 as evolved discs . in the lms regime from the 3 objects classified as ctts ,",
    "2 show ir excesses indicative of class ii and 1 was classified as an evolved disc .",
    "even if we considered as accretors only those bds that were classified as ctts _ and _ class ii , the fractions at both sides of the sub - stellar mass limit remain different : @xmath45 for bds , @xmath46 for lmss and with a probability @xmath47 that both fractions are different within @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the bd 4 was classified as ctts although it is close to the wtts / ctts limit from @xcite .",
    "even if we considered as ctts only the bds showing strong @xmath48 in emission ( numbers 3 , 6 , 9 and 21 ) , the ctts fraction is @xmath49 which is still higher than the fraction obtained in the lms regime .",
    "@xmath50 the bds 4 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 and 19 have information in the j , h and ks - bands from the surveys vista and 2mass . from these ,",
    "the bds 19 and 17 show evidence of 1@xmath9 variability in the three band - passes but such level of variability does not change the general results presented here because the fits to the @xcite models , changing the photometry randomly within the variations we found , do not change significantly .",
    "@xmath51 the bd 4 shows an unexpectedly high extinction @xmath52 , considering that the mean extinction towards the 25 orionis group and orion ob1a is @xmath53 .",
    "this bd shows a sed clearly consistent with the median sed for taurus and was classified as a class ii although the available photometry at wavelengths shorter than h - band , where the excesses are not detected , is not enough for a reliable fit into the photospheric models .",
    "additionally it shows @xmath48 line in emission which is consistent with ongoing accretion .",
    "we speculate that its strong extinction could be a result of the disk being edge - on .",
    "@xmath54 the bd 9 shows an extinction @xmath55 which is slightly higher but it is consistent with mean extinction towards the region if the uncertainty in the spectral type is considered .",
    "@xmath56 the bd 4 was classified as ctts and the bds 14 and 18 as wtts but there are close to the ctts / wtts limit proposed by @xcite .",
    "new spectroscopic observations with a higher snr are needed to improve their spectral classification ( particularly bd 14 ) as well as the measurement of the h@xmath23 equivalent widths in order to improve their classification as ctts or wtts sub - stellar analogous .",
    "we have studied 21 candidate bds belonging to the 25 orionis group and the orion ob1a subassociation and spectroscopically confirmed 15 of them as new sub - stellar members with spectral types between m6 and m9 . comparing the seds of the new members at wavelengths beyond @xmath57 with those from the bt - dusty photospheric models @xcite for the temperatures corresponding to their spectral types and with the mean sed for taurus representative of class ii @xcite",
    ", we detect ir excesses indicative of class ii , evolved disc and class iii .",
    "we also classified the new bds as ctts and wtts sub - stellar analogous according to the empiric limit proposed by @xcite .",
    "we have applyed a bayesian analysis to compute the number fractions of bds showing disc and magnetospheric accretion signatures and compare them with those for a sample of 77 lms belonging to the 25 orionis group from @xcite , classified following the same procedures .",
    "we find a significant higher fraction of ctts , evolved discs and class ii objects in the sub - stellar mass regime than in the lms regime and a fraction of wtts and class iii which is lower for bds than for lms .",
    "all the differences were found to have a high statistical significance .",
    "our main result is that the number fractions of bds classified as ctts _ and _ class ii or evolved disc result to be @xmath5 for bds while for the lms is @xmath4 .",
    "such difference has a probability @xmath58 of being real .",
    "the differences between the fractions of discs and accretion signatures at both sides of the sub - stellar mass limit could be interpreted , at least , considering the following three scenarios :    @xmath50 if the disc fraction were not dependent on the mass of the central object , a way to mimic the observed fractions would be for the formation of bds to occur over a longer period of time than for the lms . in this scenario ,",
    "the younger bds would still retain the discs , increasing the mean disc fractions for bds with respect to the lms .",
    "nevertheless , we found @xmath59 of bds are ctts and class ii or evolved disc which is similar to the fraction observed for lms at ages of @xmath60 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * @xmath9 ori ; @xmath61 ) .",
    "therefore , the observed population should have started to form @xmath0 ago and extended only for bds until @xmath62 ago .",
    "such an age difference should be reflected in the h - r diagram as a larger scatter of the bd locus relative to the lms , which is not observed in the results presented here . in addition",
    ", extinction patterns commonly found in regions of about @xmath60 , such as @xmath9 ori or orion ob1b , are not observed in the surveyed area @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 if the time scale for disc dissipation were the same for bds and lms , the initial fraction of discs would have to be higher for bds than for lms , as suggested by @xcite , in order to reproduce the larger disc fractions observed for bds relative to lms at a given age .",
    "since we are measuring lms and bd disc fractions at a single age of @xmath0 , our observations alone can not rule out a difference in the initial disc fractions .",
    "however , comparing with observations in the @xmath60 old @xmath9 ori from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath61 for lms ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath18 for bds ) , we see that for lms the fraction drops from @xmath61 to @xmath63 while for bds it drops from @xmath18 to @xmath59 .",
    "this means the disc fraction drops by a factor @xmath64 for lms and by a factor of @xmath65 for bds in the period of time from @xmath60 to @xmath0 .",
    "this strongly suggest that , regardless of the initial disc fractions , disc evolution occurred faster for lms than for bds , which leads us to the third and last scenario .",
    "@xmath54 the bd and lms populations are coeval and the time scale for disc evolution depends on the mass of the central object , being slower for bds than for lms .",
    "our results support this scenario , which has been previously suggested by [ e.g. ] @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more spectroscopic and photometric optical and near - ir observations for lms and bds populations in star forming regions with ages around @xmath6 old and older are needed in order to clearly constrain how the evolution of the discs proceeds and what is its dependency with the mass of the central object . in order to understand the physical scenarios involved , modeling and simulations",
    "are also needed , as well as a consistent statistical estimation of the number fractions and their comparisons for different regions .",
