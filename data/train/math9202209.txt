    "a numerical experiment was performed in order to check conjecture 1 of the introduction . to this end ,",
    "a family of almost smooth maps with a flat spot was considered given by the formula @xmath333 @xmath334 these are symmetric maps with the critical exponent @xmath335 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 controls the length of the flat spot , while @xmath55 must be adjusted to get the desired rotation number .    in our experiment ,",
    "@xmath9 was chosen to be @xmath336 , which corresponds to the flat spot of the same length . by binary search ,",
    "a value @xmath337 was found which approximated the parameter value corresponding to the golden mean rotation number @xmath338 .",
    "next , the forward orbit of the flat spot was studied and the results are given in the table below .",
    "it should finally be noted that the experiment presents serious numerical difficulties as nearest returns to the critical value tend to @xmath31 very quickly so that the double precision is insufficient when one wants to see more than @xmath339 nearest returns .",
    "this problem was avoided , at a considerable expense of computing time , by the use of an experimental package which allows for floating - point calculations to be carried out with arbitrarily prescribed precision .",
