    "the time - dependent quantum many - body problem has become of particular interest within recent years .",
    "new experimental investigations offer many different possibilities to study quantum systems in the presence of external driven degrees of freedom , such as cold atomic gases @xcite , ultrafast spectroscopy on semiconductors @xcite , flux pattern formation in superconducting films @xcite or single molecule force spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "many of the available theoretical methods evaluate the quantum dynamics of such driven systems in a certain limit .",
    "if the time - scale of the external degrees of freedom is slow with respect to the intrinsic dynamics of the system , it is possible to perform calculations with high mathematical rigor by means of adiabatic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "many methods apply to time - periodic perturbations .",
    "if the driving frequency @xmath1 exceeds the largest energy - scale of the unperturbed system , a good method is an expansion in powers of @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the coupling between the system and the perturbation , to derive a time independent effective hamiltonian @xcite . in the general time - periodic case one",
    "often follows the floquet approach @xcite .",
    "the problem of calculating the quantum evolution of a certain initial state for an arbitrary switching procedure is often addressed in time - dependent keldysh perturbation theory @xcite . however , such calculations are frequently limited to linear response , and expansions with respect to bare couplings can produce errors which grow in time .",
    "furthermore , self - consistency schemes often yield a system of coupled non - linear integro differential equations , which are not convenient for numerical evaluation .",
    "pure numerical techniques are the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group @xcite , time - dependent density - functional theory @xcite , and exact diagonalization of the operator @xmath4 in discretized form .    here",
    "we develop a new method to deal with the driven many - body problem , which is a similarity renormalization scheme for time - dependent hamiltonians based on wegner s flow equation method for the time - independent case @xcite .",
    "we apply our new approach to the isotropic ferromagnetic kondo model @xmath5 in a situation where the ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath6 is switched on continuously from zero to a nonzero constant value  @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the impurity spin-1/2 degree of freedom and @xmath9 is the conduction band electron spin density .",
    "we choose this example for illustrating our approach because it is a many - body system which allows for a perturbative evaluation of the truncated rg equations , which posess a nontrivial rg flow .",
    "the second motivation comes from recent calculations that provided insights in the quantum dynamics of systems subjected to a sudden interaction quench @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics in which the expectation values of certain observables are enhanced with respect to their equilibrium values .",
    "specifically , we consider a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath10 where the term @xmath11 is switched on by some protocol @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we study the time evolution of the system prepared in the ground state @xmath15 of @xmath16 in the infinite past , that is @xmath17 generated by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 be any observable that commutes with @xmath16 .",
    "we define its _ mismatch factor _",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the noninteracting expectation value , @xmath24 is the interacting expectation value with respect to the ground state @xmath25 of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the time - averaged nonequilbrium expectation value .    for adiabatic switching on of @xmath11 we have @xmath28 since @xmath17 asymptotically becomes the interacting ground state @xmath25 .",
    "remarkably , in the opposite limit of sudden switching @xmath29 of a weak perturbation @xmath11 one finds the universal value @xmath30 in many quantum systems .",
    "in fact , a mismatch factor @xmath31 can be proven rigorously for discrete weakly interacting systems @xcite in second order perturbation theory . the same factor",
    "@xmath30 arises in many weak - coupling continuous systems like the quantum sine - gordon model for @xmath32 @xcite or in the ferromagnetic kondo model with an infinitesimal positive magnetic field@xcite . in the latter model",
    "it describes the ratio of the large time asymptotic impurity spin normalized through its equilibrium value @xmath33 for an interaction quench in a fermi gas in @xmath34 dimensions , the mismatch factor of the correlation - induced corrections to the momentum distribution between nonequilibrium and equilibrium state turned out to be the key to understanding thermalization @xcite .",
    "however , in this model the universal value @xmath30 is only found when averaging over an intermediate well - defined time window in ( [ defoneq ] ) , which describes the prethermalized regime .    due to the important role of the mismatch factor  @xmath21 in characterizing the nonequilibrium dynamics , it is natural to investigate its behavior when the protocol @xmath12 interpolates between adiabatic and instantaneous switching . for the hubbard model",
    "this has been carried out by means of lowest order keldysh perturbation theory @xcite . due to the finite switching time , the dynamics becomes adiabatic for fast modes leading to @xmath28 for fast modes ( large momenta ) .    for the ferromagnetic kondo problem @xcite a similar analysis of the crossover from adiabatic to instantaneous quenches has not yet been established .",
    "since it posesses a nontrivial scaling flow , it is not clear what energy scale marks the transition from adiabatic to a sudden response of the electron system .",
    "in addition , there is no intuitive picture about the fate of the renormalized exchange couplings in presence of a time - dependent vertex . applying our new time - dependent flow equation approach",
    ", we will show that the relevant scaling flow is just the instantaneous one ( at least for the resonant infrared couplings which characterize the dynamics of the kondo system at large times ) .",
    "this allows us to study the real time evolution for this non - sudden and non - adiabatic switching procedure within a non - perturbative scheme . here",
    "non - perturbative means that this result can not be obtained from summing a finite number of diagrams .",
    "the advantage of our renormalization scheme is to avoid the usual complicated reordering of the perturbation series labeled by the bare coupling @xmath35 , by solving the truncated one loop rg - equations .",
    "our motivation is therefore twofold : in the first part of this paper we introduce the new formalism and explain how it can be used for generic time - dependent many body problems .",
    "in the second part we apply this approach to study the quantum dynamics of the ferromagnetic kondo model ( [ defferrokondo ] ) subjected to a continuously switching on of the interaction .",
    "we calculate the mismatch factor @xmath21 from ( [ defmusz ] ) as well as the long - time behavior of the impurity magnetization curve depending on the switching protocol .",
    "a convenient way to solve the time - dependent many - body problem would be the application of a unitary time - dependent transformation @xmath36 that makes the hamiltonian @xmath37 simple enough for solving the schroedinger equation @xmath38 in the new basis @xmath39 .",
    "now even for the simplest quantum models such as the driven two - level system , there is no general way to find a transformation which simplifies ( [ timedepschroedinger ] ) considerably and therefore this approach is not commonly used .    in this paper",
    "we will develop such a general approach based on a suitable extension of the time - independent flow equation method ( method of infinitesimal unitary transformations ) @xcite . instead of performing the change of basis ( [ defcalh ] ) in one step ,",
    "it is convenient to use infinitesimal steps by solving the differential equation @xmath40+i\\partial_{t}\\eta(b , t ) \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a suitable antihermitean generator @xmath41 and the initial condition posed at @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) becomes equivalent with ( [ defcalh ] ) for the following unitary transformation constructed as a @xmath44-ordered exponential @xmath45\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] this approach stays conceptually close to the time - independent formulation and becomes equivalent to it for time - independent hamiltonians  @xmath46 .",
    "now the key question is how to choose the infinitesimal generator @xmath41 such that the series of hamiltonians @xmath47 eventually becomes diagonal during the flow from @xmath42 to @xmath48 .",
    "the suitable choice is to add an additional time derivative to wegner s canonical generator for the time - independent case @xcite : @xmath49-i\\partial_{t}\\mathcal{h}_{int}(b , t)\\ , \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 denotes the diagonal part of the flowing hamiltonian and @xmath51 its interaction part , @xmath52",
    ". then one can easily show that the time - dependent interaction matrix elements satisfy an inhomogeneous diffusion equation with a negative source term @xmath53   =    -2\\:\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\eta(b , t)\\eta^\\dagger(b , t)\\right ] \\leq 0\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] this ensures that for @xmath54 only resonant couplings @xmath55 remain in the interaction part of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence in general there remains a simpler time evolution problem in the @xmath48 basis with at most the complexity of the common rotating wave approximation .",
    "the main computational problem of our new approach is that solving the set of partial differential equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) is more difficult than the set of ordinary differential equations in the time - independent case .",
    "notice that according to ( [ eq:3 ] ) the parameter  @xmath44 has the dimension energy@xmath56 , therefore our flow occurs in an energy - scale separated way by first decoupling matrix elements with large energy differences before looking at smaller energy differences .",
    "this will turn out to produce an rg - like scaling flow for time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "next we illustrate this new approach for the weak coupling ferromagnetic kondo model ( [ defferrokondo ] ) , which will allow for a controlled truncation of the infinite set of flow equations in an expansion in the time - dependent running coupling @xmath57 .",
    "the calculation proceeds along similar lines to the interaction quench in the ferromagnetic kondo model , therefore we adopt the notation from refs .",
    "details of the calculation will be published separately .",
    "to leading order in the running coupling constants ( equivalent to one loop order in the conventional scaling approach ) the flowing time - dependent hamiltonian can be parametrized as @xmath58 with the interaction part @xmath59 from ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) one derives the key result for the time - dependent one loop scaling equation of the coupling constant : @xmath60 where we have introduced the operator @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the occupation number distribution of the noninteracting conduction band . in the sequel we will only consider the zero temperature case ( the generalization to nonzero temperature is straightforward ) : @xmath63 where we have taken the fermi energy @xmath64 .",
    "notice that ( [ eq:7 ] ) holds for arbitrary time - dependence and both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the neglected normal ordered terms in the flow of the hamiltonian are third order in the running couplings .    for time - independent couplings",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) reduces to the standard one loop scaling equation of the flow equation formalism @xcite . for the time - dependent case eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) has the structure of a complicated non - linear diffusion equation : an interaction that is initially localized in time spreads out during the @xmath44-evolution . notice that this does not lead to violation of causality since all the observables undergo the same unitary flow , therefore a time - dependent expectation value at time  @xmath65 does only depend on couplings @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is best analyzed in fourier space , @xmath68 the solution of the linearized form of ( [ eq:7 ] ) gives the enveloping behavior of the flowing couplings which we later dress with the one loop scaling flow .",
    "the linearized solution is simple in fourier space : @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath71 is the fourier transform of @xmath35 from ( [ defferrokondo ] ) .",
    "therefore our formalism with the generator ( [ eq:3 ] ) eliminates the non - resonant fourier modes first in an energy scale separated way in a direct generalization of conventional time - independent scaling theory .",
    "now one can parametrize the full solution of ( [ eq:7 ] ) very accurately ( meaning : correct in one loop order ) by the following approximation @xmath72 where the flow of @xmath73 is determined from the flow of @xmath74 at the point @xmath75 .",
    "the notation @xmath76 corresponds to the average energy of @xmath77 and @xmath78 : @xmath79 . in ( [ eq:11 ] )",
    "the flow of the dimensionless coupling @xmath73 therefore effectively dresses the linearized solution with the one loop scaling flow .",
    "substituting @xmath75 into ( [ eq:7 ] ) yields the following scaling equation for @xmath80 @xmath81 here the initial condition is posed at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the band width of the conduction band .",
    "@xmath84 is the density of states in the conduction band , which we assume to be constant .",
    "specificially , for the time - independent case with @xmath85 one finds @xmath86 .",
    "since the flow at the fermi surface determines the low - energy physics we use the identification @xmath87 and ( [ eq:12 ] ) reduces to the usual one loop scaling equation for the infrared behavior @xmath88 or in terms of the scaling parameter @xmath89 with dimension energy : @xmath90 the solution shows the characteristic logarithmic scaling of the kondo model , @xmath91",
    "in our model we are interested in a situation where the exchange interaction @xmath35 is switched on continuously over a timescale @xmath0 . for convenience we choose the specific form @xmath92 with ferromagnetic @xmath93 : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the fourier transform of ( [ eq:9 ] ) is @xmath96 which permits simple analytic expressions in our subsequent calculations .",
    "for example the linearized solution ( [ eq:8 ] ) of ( [ eq:7 ] ) given the initial condition ( [ eqinitialcond ] ) takes the following form @xmath97 notice however that the formalism can be carried through for an arbitrary switching protocol .",
    "next we need to calculate how the one loop scaling flow ( [ eq:12 ] ) dresses the linearized solution . using the dirac identity",
    "one can verify that the parametrization @xmath98 in ( [ eq:12 ] ) leads to the following scaling equation @xmath99 with the initial condition @xmath100 .",
    "one can verify that the shift @xmath101 on the rhs of ( [ eq:12 ] ) can be neglected in one loop order in the derivation of ( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) can be solved easily : for @xmath102 the flow is to a very good approximation ( meaning : correct in one loop order ) just the static flow ( [ eq : staticj ] ) @xmath103 which stops once the energy scale @xmath104 is reached , @xmath105 remarkably the switching scale @xmath0 does not enter in these equations .",
    "notice that we find the expected weak coupling flow for the ferromagnetic case , which makes our calculation controlled by a small parameter .",
    "summing up we have derived the following one loop flow of the coupling constants @xmath106 with @xmath107 according to ( [ eq : gflow ] ) and ( [ eq : gfinal ] ) for energies around the fermi surface , @xmath108 .",
    "next we want to evaluate observables making use of the diagonal structure of the hamiltonian for @xmath48 .",
    "specifically , let us consider an observable  @xmath20 without explicit time dependence and an initial state  @xmath109 given at time  @xmath110 .",
    "then the expectation value of  @xmath20 at time  @xmath65 is @xmath111 where @xmath112 follows from the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation with respect to  @xmath18 .",
    "we can rewrite this in the heisenberg picture @xmath113 with @xmath114 and the time evolution @xmath115 evaluated in the simple @xmath48 basis : @xmath116\\ ] ] @xmath117 from ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) is therefore the solution of the equations of motion for the operator  @xmath20 with the initial condition @xmath118 .",
    "the explicit evaluation of ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) proceeds similar to the forward - backward flow equation transformation scheme for time - independent hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "first we derive @xmath119 by solving the differential flow equation @xmath120 \\label{eq : flowobt}\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath121 and the result @xmath122 .",
    "next we employ the time evolution @xmath123 which will usually be simple since @xmath124 is diagonal .",
    "then we undo the transformation and go back into the original basis , @xmath125 by solving the differential equation @xmath126 \\label{eq : trfback}\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath127 now posed at @xmath48 .",
    "the solution at @xmath42 gives the desired time evolved operator for ( [ eq : defott0 ] ) , @xmath128 .",
    "the main difference to the time - independent case @xcite is that here the forward and backward unitary transformations @xmath36 and @xmath129 will generically be different .",
    "the key advantage of our approach is like in ref .",
    "@xcite that there are no secular terms in time ( i.e. errors that grow with @xmath130 ) since we can evaluate ( [ eq : p ] ) exactly for diagonal hamiltonians in the @xmath48 basis .",
    "we want to use the above framework to derive the time evolution of the impurity spin expectation value starting from an initial product state with a fully polarized spin at @xmath131 : @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the zero temperature fermi sea . for the unitary transformation of the observable @xmath134 we make the following ansatz @xcite @xmath135 where we neglect higher order terms in order @xmath136 . the flow equations ( [ eq : flowobt ] ) for the coefficients",
    "are structurally identical to refs .",
    "@xcite with an additional time dependence : @xmath137 it is possible to verify that one can use the solution ( [ eq : flowingcoupling ] ) for all values @xmath138 in these equations , the deviation only plays a role in higher orders . the solution for the fourier transform at @xmath48 with the initial condition @xmath139 , @xmath140 is readily obtained as @xmath141 time evolution ( [ eq : p ] ) just generates additional phase factors @xmath142 . inserting the result back in ( [ eq : trfback ] ) and integrating back to @xmath42 yields @xmath143 and @xmath144 plus terms that are third order in the running coupling .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) therefore constitute the solution for the operator equation of motion in the original basis and we can immediately read off the desired spin expectation value @xmath145 now one can easily work out @xmath146 for @xmath147 , @xmath148 which yields @xmath149 where @xmath150 is just the usual infrared running coupling constant ( [ eq : staticj ] ) of the time - independent kondo model .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) is our key result which contains both the asymptotic magnetization for @xmath151 and the approach to it as a function of the switching time scale  @xmath0 .",
    "it can be viewed as a systematic resummation of the short time perturbative expansion @xcite that incorporates both scaling effects and the switching protocol ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "notice that while we have made the simplifying assumption @xmath152 in deriving ( [ eq:28 ] ) , one can obtain the behavior on all time scales from ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) shows the correct limiting behavior for adiabatic switching on ( @xmath153 ) @xmath154 which reproduces the equilibrium magnetization for an infinitesimal magnetic field @xcite . for instantaneous switching @xmath155 eq .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) reproduces the results from refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath156 the mismatch factor @xmath21 introduced in ( [ defmusz ] ) interpolates between ( [ szeq ] ) and ( [ szneq ] ) as a function of the switching time  @xmath0 , @xmath157 and can be derived from ( [ eq:28 ] ) @xmath158 it is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure : mu ] and shows the expected crossover from  2 ( instantaneous quench ) to  1 ( adiabatic quench equivalent to equilibrium ) .",
    "notice that  @xmath159 starts to deviate from  2 when @xmath0 becomes of order the inverse bandwidth since then there are fast modes with @xmath160 for which the quench is no longer instantaneous .",
    "however , the approach to the equilibrium value  1 is very slow , @xmath161 for example the value @xmath162 is only reached at the nonperturbative time scale @xmath163 .     from ( [ eq : mu ] ) for @xmath164 . ]    likewise the approach of the spin expectation value to its asymptotic value is also logarithmic and ( remarkably ) independent of  @xmath0 as can be derived from ( [ eq:28 ] ) @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "we illustrated how a generalization of the flow equation method can be used to study time - dependent hamiltonians with a nontrivial scaling behavior .",
    "in particular for the time - dependent ferromagnetic kondo model we calculated the mismatch factor  @xmath21 which measures the `` non - adiabacity '' of the quench .",
    "different from previously studied models like the quench in the hubbard model @xcite here the approach of @xmath21 to the equilibrium value is only logarithmic and one needs to quench very slowly to reach the adiabatic limit .",
