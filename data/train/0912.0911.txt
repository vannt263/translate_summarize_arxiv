    "depending on the spins on its adjacent edges , each vertex will be assigned a _",
    "boltzmann weight_.    the boltzmann weight will be zero unless the number of adjacent edges labeled  ` @xmath77 ' is even .",
    "let us denote the possibly nonzero boltzmann weights as follows : @xmath78 we will consider the vertices in two possible orientations , as shown above , and arrange these boltzmann weights into a matrix as follows : @xmath79 if the edge spins are labeled @xmath80 as follows : @xmath81 then we will denote by @xmath82 the corresponding boltzmann weight .",

    "because we will sometimes use several different systems of boltzmann weights within a single lattice , we label each vertex with the corresponding matrix from which the weights are taken .",

    "the value or boltzmann weight of the left - hand side is just the product of the boltzmann weights at the three vertices , that is , @xmath105 , and similarly the right - hand side .",

    "he considered mainly the _ field - free case _ where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the condition @xmath116 is easily removed , but with no gain in generality .",
    "the other two conditions @xmath113 , @xmath117 are more serious restrictions .    in the field - free case ,",

    "one may check that @xmath148 . on the other hand",
    ", it may be checked that the relations required by @xmath112 are contradictory unless @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    in the field - free case",
    ", these two relations reduce to a single one , @xmath119 , and it is remarkable that @xmath149 has the same value : @xmath150 .",
    "this equality has important implications for the study of _ row - transfer matrices _ , one of baxter s original motivations for introducing the star - triangle relation .",
    "given boltzmann weights @xmath151 , we associate a @xmath152 matrix @xmath153 .",
    "the entries in this matrix are indexed by pairs @xmath154 , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 .",
    "if @xmath157 we may consider the boltzmann weight of the configuration : @xmath158 here @xmath159 , so the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "the coefficient @xmath160 is then the `` partition function '' for this one - row configuration , that is , the sum over possible states ( assignments of the @xmath161 ) .",

    "this gives a great simplification of the analysis in chapter  9 of baxter  @xcite over the analysis in chapter  8 using different methods based on the bethe ansatz .    in the non - field - free case",
    ", however , the situation is different . if @xmath140 and @xmath141 then by theorem  [ groupoidcase ] there exists @xmath7 such that @xmath165 , and so one may use baxter s method to prove the commutativity of @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "however @xmath166 and @xmath167 are not necessarily the same as @xmath168 and @xmath141 , respectively , and so @xmath153 may not commute with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "in addition to the field - free case , however , there is _ another _ case where @xmath153 necessarily does commute with @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and it is that case which we turn to next .",

    "the next theorem will show that if the weights of @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfy this condition , then @xmath7 exists such that @xmath112 , and moreover the weights of @xmath7 also satisfy the same condition .",
    "thus not only @xmath170 and @xmath171 but also @xmath172 lie in the same space of commuting transfer matrices .    in this case , with @xmath173 , etc . , we define @xmath174    [ groupcase]suppose that @xmath175 then the @xmath176 defined by @xmath177 satisfies @xmath112",

    "however we are free to multiply @xmath7 by a constant without changing the validity of @xmath148 , so we divide it by @xmath183 .",
    "we started with @xmath40 and @xmath41 and produced @xmath7 such that @xmath184 because this is the construction motivated by baxter s method of proving that transfer matrices commute .",
    "however it is perhaps more elegant to start with @xmath7 and @xmath41 and produce @xmath40 as a function of these .",

    "this composition law is determined by the condition that @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the map ( [ thisispi ] ) .",
    "then @xmath187 is a group , isomorphic to @xmath193 .",
    "this is a formal consequence of theorem  [ groupcase ] .",
    "it is interesting that , in the non - field - free case , the group law occurs when @xmath194 . in the application to statistical physics for field - free weights ,",
    "phase transitions occur when @xmath195 . if @xmath196 the system is `` frozen '' in the sense that there are correlations between distant vertices .",
    "by contrast @xmath197 is the disordered range where no such correlations occur , so our group law occurs in the analog of the middle of the disordered range .",
    "theorem  [ groupcaseagain ] , defining a group structure on a set of r - matrices , may be regarded as a non - abelian parametrized yang - baxter equation . in our example , the composition law on r - matrices that makes @xmath40 the product of @xmath7 and @xmath41 when @xmath112 is associative because of its definition in terms of matrix multiplication . in this section ,",
    "we give a heuristic argument suggesting that any time we have such a composition law defined by the vanishing of a yang - baxter commutator , associativity should follow .",
    "this section is not needed for the sequel .",
    "let us assume that we are given a vector space @xmath3 over a field @xmath198 and a subset @xmath185 of @xmath2 which is homogeneous in the sense that if @xmath199 then @xmath185 contains the entire ray @xmath200 .",
    "let @xmath201 be the set of such rays .",
    "let us assume that if @xmath202 are nonzero elements of @xmath185 then there is another @xmath203 that is unique up to scalar multiple such that @xmath112 .",
    "as we remarked before theorem  [ groupcase ] there might be such an @xmath40 that would be useable for applications but that it might not lie in the same space @xmath185 , and indeed this is the usual situation for the six vertex model with weights that are not field - free and also not in the free fermionic case of theorem  [ groupcase ] . but with this assumption , @xmath204 is a well - defined composition law on @xmath201 .",
    "let us denote this composition @xmath190 .",
    "we will give a plausible argument that this composition law should be associative .",
    "we begin with three nonzero elements @xmath27 of @xmath185 . we will compare endomorphisms of @xmath205 .",
    "in addition to identities such as @xmath206 we will use identities such as @xmath207 which are true for arbitrary endomorphisms of @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath208    first , we have @xmath209 equal to @xmath210 using another string of manipulations , we have @xmath211 equal to @xmath212 now consider an endomorphism @xmath64 of @xmath9 that is constrained to satisfy @xmath213 this is a linear equation in the matrix coefficients of @xmath64 in which the number of conditions exceeds the number of variables .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that if this has a nonzero solution that solution is determined up to constant multiple .",
    "therefore ( up to a constant ) we have @xmath214 , that is , @xmath215 taking the determinant shows that the constant must be a root of unity .",
    "if @xmath216 or @xmath217 and @xmath201 is connected , then by continuity this constant must be 1 .",
    "this means that @xmath218 satisfies the definition of @xmath219 , so at least plausibly , a composition law defined this way should be associative .",
    "let @xmath220 and @xmath221 be complex numbers with all @xmath222 .",
    "we will refer to the @xmath56 as _ spectral parameters _ and the @xmath51 as _ deformation parameters _ since these are the roles these variables will play when we turn to tokuyama s theorem .",
    "denote @xmath223 let @xmath224 , where it is convenient to take the constant to be @xmath225 .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ groupcase ] that @xmath226 where @xmath227 is related to @xmath228 by the relation ( [ thisispi ] ) .",
    "concretely ,    @xmath229    the six types of vertices corresponding to the non - zero entries of @xmath230 and @xmath231 are given in table  [ tablegam ] , together with their boltzmann weights .",
    "@xmath232    [ ybesymmetric]the star - triangle identity @xmath233 is valid with boltzmann weights as in table  [ tablegam ] .",
    "this follows from theorem  [ groupcase ] since @xmath234 .",
    "we will use gamma ice to represent schur polynomials , which are essentially the characters of finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath235 then we may regard @xmath236 as an element of the @xmath237 weight lattice and call it a _",

    "partition_.    the word `` partition '' occurs in two different senses in this paper .",
    "the partition function in statistical physics is different from partitions in the combinatorial sense .",
    "so for us a reference to a `` partition '' without `` function '' refers to an integer partition .",
    "also potentially ambiguous is the term `` weight , '' referring to an element of the @xmath46 weight lattice , which we identify with @xmath241 .",
    "therefore if we mean boltzmann weight , we will not omit `` boltzmann . ''",
    "let @xmath242 be a fixed partition .",
    "we will denote @xmath243 .",
    "we will consider a rectangular grid with @xmath244 rows and @xmath245 columns .",
    "we will number the columns of the lattice in descending order from @xmath246 to @xmath247 .",
    "a _ state _ of the model will consist of an assignment of `` spins '' @xmath33 to every edge .",
    "we will also assign labels to the vertices themselves , which will be integers between @xmath248 and @xmath244 . for gamma ice",
    "the vertices in the @xmath22-th row will have the label @xmath22 .",
    "the spins of the boundary edges are prescribed as follows .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath249 and @xmath250 , so that @xmath251",
    ". then the spins on the boundary are as in the following figure . @xmath252",
    "the column labels are written at the top , and the vertex labels are written next to each vertex .",
    "the edge spins are marked inside circles .",

    "the states are : @xmath263 the partition function for general @xmath43 of arbitrary rank will be evaluated later in this paper using the star - triangle relation .",
    "let us momentarily consider a gamma ice with just one layer of vertices , so there are three rows of spins .",
    "let @xmath264 be the column numbers ( from left to right ) of @xmath77 s in the top row of spins , and let @xmath265 be the column numbers of @xmath77 s in the bottom row of edges .",
    "for example , in the ice @xmath266 we have @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 . since the columns are labeled in decreasing order , we have @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "[ onelayerlem]suppose that the spin at the left edge is @xmath273",

    "this lemma is essentially the _ line - conservation _ principle in baxter  @xcite , section 8.3 .",
    "the spins in the middle row are determined by those in the top and bottom rows and the left - most spin in the middle row , which is @xmath273 , since the edges at each vertex have an even number of @xmath273 spins .",
    "if the rows do not interleave then one of the illegal configurations @xmath281 will occur .",
    "thus @xmath282 since if not , the vertex in the @xmath283 column would be surrounded by spins in the first illegal configuration .",
    "now @xmath284 since otherwise the vertex in the @xmath285 column would be surrounded by spins in the second above illegal configuration , and so forth .",
    "the last statement is a consequence of the observation that the total number of spins must be even .",
    "we recall that a _ gelfand - tsetlin pattern _ is a triangular array of dominant weights , in which each row has length one less than the one above it , and the rows interleave .",
    "the pattern is called _ strict _ if the rows are strictly dominant .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ onelayerlem ] that taking the locations of @xmath77 in the rows of vertical lattice edges gives a sequence of strictly dominant weights forming a strict gelfand - tsetlin pattern .",
    "for example , given the state @xmath286 the corresponding pattern is @xmath287 it is not hard to see that this gives a bijection between strict gelfand - tsetlin patterns and states with boundary conditions determined by  @xmath43 .",
    "let us say that the _ weight _ of a state is @xmath288 if the boltzmann weight is the monomial @xmath289 times a polynomial in @xmath51 .",

    "we have @xmath298 .",
    "it is easy to see that the vertex in the @xmath23-column has one of the above configurations if and only if its column number @xmath23 satisfies @xmath299 for some @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the number of such @xmath23 is @xmath300 .",
    "in this section we will prove the following result .",
    "[ tokicethm]let @xmath242 be a partition .",
    "then @xmath301    to begin with , define @xmath302 we will eventually show that @xmath55 is the schur polynomial @xmath52 . but _ a priori _ it is not obvious from this definition that @xmath55 is symmetric , nor that it is a polynomial , nor that it is independent of  @xmath303 .",
    "[ symmetriclabel]the expression @xmath304 is invariant under the interchange of the spectral and deformation parameters : @xmath305 .",

    "this is clear .",
    "for the numerator , the number of @xmath77 in the top row of vertical lattice edge spins is @xmath244 by the boundary conditions , and it follows from lemma  [ onelayerlem ] that each successive row has one fewer @xmath77 .",
