    "very recently , quantum rings in inas - gaas heterostructures have been fabricated in the nanometer scale @xcite , and the capacitance and far - infrared ( fir ) response have been measured for the one- and two - electron quantum rings .",
    "previously , the fir response@xcite had been measured for mesoscopic rings in gaas - ga@xmath2al@xmath3as heterostructures , for which a description based on classical and hydrodynamical models works fairly well@xcite . in nanoscopic rings",
    "quantum effects are important and for this reason theoretical studies at a more microscopic level have been undertaken @xcite .    in some of these calculations a major emphasis has been put on describing the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) quantum effect which manifests in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 as the existence of a persistent current , and leads to periodic oscillations in the energy spectrum and the persistent current as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "these ab oscillations have been observed in mesoscopic rings in a gaalas / gaas heterostructure by measuring the conductance across the ring@xcite .",
    "the experimental results for one- and two - electron nanoscopic rings have been theoretically analyzed@xcite using the current density ( cdft ) and time - dependent local - spin density - functional ( tdlsdft ) theories , and a good agreement between theory and experiment is found ( see also refs . and ) .",
    "motivated by this success , in this work we extend this approach to a systematic study of ground state ( gs ) and spectroscopic properties of nanoscopic rings containing up to @xmath4 electrons .",
    "our aim is to show the physical appearance of quantities that could be measured in the future if the problem of fabricating many - electron nanoscopic rings is eventually solved .",
    "specifically , we have obtained electro - chemical potentials @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total energy of the @xmath7-electron ring , addition energies @xmath8 , and the spin and charge density responses at finite on - plane transferred wave - vector , which are relevant for the analysis of raman spectra .",
    "all these quantities have been measured in @xmath7-electron quantum dots , see for example refs . and references therein .",
    "particular emphasis is given to spectroscopic results .",
    "we show that the collective excitation energies exhibit discontinuities in their @xmath1 dependence , which are a manifestation of changes in the spin configuration of the ground state , and that in a ring - wire would be related to the fractional aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the structure of the ring gs has been obtained within the cdft as described in refs . and .",
    "to obtain the charge and spin density responses we have used tdlsdft as described in refs . and .",
    "essentially , the method implies that to obtain the ground state and excited modes of the system , besides the direct electron - electron interaction , exchange and correlation effects have been included in a local density approximation .",
    "we refer the reader to these references for a comprehensive exposure of the cdft and tdlsdft , of direct applicability here changing the shape of the confining potential from a dotlike potential to a ringlike potential .",
    "following ref . , we have modeled the ring confining potential by a parabola @xmath9 with @xmath10 nm and @xmath11 mev .",
    "these values are close to the ones used@xcite to describe the rings studied by lorke et al@xcite .",
    "the electron effective mass @xmath12 ( we write @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the physical electron mass ) and effective gyromagnetic factor @xmath15 have been taken from the experiments@xcite , and the value of the dielectric constant has been taken to be @xmath16 . the model is strictly two - dimensional , and as a consequence of circular symmetry , the single particle ( sp ) wave functions are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum @xmath17 and can be written as @xmath18 with @xmath19 notice that with this convention , the sp orbital angular momentum is @xmath20 .",
    "some times we have used effective atomic units , defined by @xmath211 . in this system of units ,",
    "the length unit is the effective bohr radius @xmath22 , and the energy unit is the effective hartree @xmath23 .",
    "this yields @xmath24 10.4 nm and @xmath25 11.15 mev .",
    "the bohr magneton is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the addition energies @xmath27 at zero magnetic field .",
    "saw - tooth structures and large peaks at magic numbers @xmath28 , 6 , 10 , 16 and 24 that correspond to close - shell rings are clearly seen .",
    "had we not taken into account electron - electron interactions ( single - particle picture ) , the magic numbers would have been @xmath28 , 6 , 10 , 16 , 20 and 24 .",
    "the effect of interaction is to weaken some shell closures , for example that at @xmath29 in the displayed results .",
    "the total - spin third - component of the gs configuration is indicated in the figure , and shows that hund s first rule , according to which as degenerate states are filled , the total spin @xmath30 takes the maximum allowed value by the exclusion principle and becomes zero for closed shells , is satisfied up to @xmath31 . for larger electron numbers",
    "hund s first rule is violated and the higher spin state no longer is the gs . in particular , @xmath32 becomes zero at @xmath29 instead of having the hund s first rule value @xmath33 .",
    "these considerations may change if the geometrical characteristics of the studied ring are different . in this respect ,",
    "we want to point out that according to the one - dimensionality criterium established in ref .",
    ", the rings we describe can not be considered as ring - wires , an obvious statement if one looks at the electron density plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "similarly to what happens in quantum dots,@xcite the application of an external magnetic field produces a nontrivial change in the ring structure , inducing changes in the spin of the gs configuration .",
    "this can be seen in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we have plotted the @xmath1 evolution of the sp energies up to @xmath34 t for @xmath35 .",
    "paying attention to the @xmath36 t region for example , one may observe a level crossing around the fermi energy when @xmath37 t. an electron moves from the @xmath38 to the @xmath39 sp level and , as a consequence , the spin state changes from a singlet to a triplet state ( st transition ) .",
    "in such a way the system minimizes its exchange energy and the gs becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "a further increase of @xmath1 changes again the situation , and at @xmath40 t an electron moves now from the @xmath41 to the @xmath42 sp level and the system undergoes a triplet @xmath43 singlet ( ts ) transition .",
    "exchange gaps in the sp energies similar to this one also occur near @xmath44 1 and 3 t , and again at @xmath45 t ( not shown in the figure ) , and are characteristic of even-@xmath7 rings before full magnetization .",
    "exchange gaps have been analyzed in quantum dots to experimentally determine the contribution form the direct coulomb and exchange electron - electron interaction to the total energy@xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different for odd-@xmath7 rings , for which the system always remains ferromagnetic ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this can be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we have plotted the @xmath1 evolution of the sp levels of the @xmath47 9 ring up to @xmath34 t. now , the level crossings around the fermi energy occur without spin changing .",
    "the situation shown in this figure is similar for all the odd-@xmath7 rings considered in this work .",
    "level crossings strongly influence the @xmath1 behavior of the electro - chemical potential , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath48 t up to @xmath49 . for even electron numbers",
    "the number of st transitions depends on @xmath7 and increases with it , as the number of level crossings to arrive at full polarization also increases",
    ". the critical @xmath1 value at which the system is fully polarized also increases with @xmath7 , and is well visible in this figure up to @xmath50 . for odd electron numbers ,",
    "the spin of the gs configuration remains constant ( @xmath51 ) in a wide @xmath1-range , and from a certain @xmath1 value on it starts increasing up to full polarization .",
    "the pairing between peaks in the electrochemical potential corresponding to consecutive @xmath7 values , as for example 9 and 10 , indicates antiparallel spin filling of a sp @xmath52-orbital by two electrons .",
    "this pairing is violated at @xmath53 for @xmath54 and 8 , and it is a manifestation of hund s first rule .",
    "it is also violated in the narrow @xmath1-regions where the spin triplet state is the gs configuration of even-@xmath7 rings .",
    "this effect can not be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] because of the @xmath55 t step used to obtain it , but can be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] below , which gives a magnified view of @xmath56 in the region around @xmath57 t. this is the same behavior found for quantum dots in ref . .",
    "quasi - periodic @xmath1-oscillations can be observed in the electro - chemical potential .",
    "the changes in spin configurations and the maxima and minima of the electro - chemical potential curves are related to sp level crossing at the fermi energy .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 the st transitions around @xmath58 , 3 , and 5.5 t , and the maxima of @xmath56 , can be related to the level crossings at these @xmath1 values shown in fig .",
    "the minima of @xmath59 and @xmath56 at @xmath60 and 4.5 t correspond to the level crossings without spin change shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "these quasi - periodic oscillations are absent in quantum dots,@xcite and are a characteristic inherent to quantum rings .",
    "we recall that for a one - electron ring - wire of radius @xmath61 the energies are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of flux quanta penetrating the ring , @xmath64 , and are periodic in the flux @xmath65 with periodicity @xmath66 .",
    "the persistent current @xmath67 associated with the @xmath52-state @xmath68 has the same periodicity . as @xmath1 increases the occupied @xmath52-state changes and gives rise to discontinuities in the current @xmath67 ( the ab effect ) , which have been experimentally observed in a mesoscopic loop in a gaas heterojunction@xcite .",

    "electron - electron interactions give rise to changes in the gs configuration that decreases the period of the ab oscillations@xcite .",
    "this effect has been explained in ref . as a consequence of hund s",
    "first rule which favors the occurence of ferromagnetic @xmath76 phases .",
    "a ring with a low degree of one - dimensionality tends to loose the periodic features of the ideal ring - wire , being somehow an intermediate case between a ring - wire and a quantum dot , and for these systems the effect is not so marked,@xcite appearing as a small amplitude oscillation whose @xmath1-width coincides with that of the ferromagnetic phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . the crucial role played by the degree of one - dimensionality in the appearance of the ab oscillations",
    "can also be appraised comparing the results for two and four electron rings obtained in refs . .",
    "in the case of an @xmath77 ring as for @xmath35 , we have found a period halving . for an @xmath51 ring like that with @xmath78 , the oscillations due to st and ts transitions are absent but",
    "there still is a period halving which in this case can be traced back to that arising for non - interacting spin-@xmath79 fermions.@xcite we have estimated that to have @xmath80 for a ring - wire of radius equal to the maximum electronic density radius in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one needs @xmath81 t. consequently , a period of @xmath82 corresponds to a period of @xmath83 t as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "a period @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 t between large amplitude oscillations of the current shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is also consisten with this picture .    we have also checked that calculating the current from the @xmath1 derivative of the total energy , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , one obtains discontinuities at the same @xmath1 values . however , both ways of calculating the persistent current do not yield the same value .",
    "this difference is attributed to the fact that our ring is not in a ` clean ' ab situation in which electrons move essentially in a @xmath1-free region@xcite .",
    "rather , an appreciable magnetic flux is going across the effective ring surface .",
    "raman spectra are obtained through two - photon inelastic light scattering .",
    "the process consists in creating an electron - hole pair ( absorption of the incident photon ) and subsequent recombination between valence and conduction bands ( emission of the final photon ) . in this",

    "one assumes that only conduction band electron are involved , and only off - resonance raman peaks excited by laser energies above the valence - conduction band gap can be described .    to obtain @xmath91 and @xmath92 within the tdlsdft ,",
    "we have calculated the response to operators whose spatial dependence in the on - plane wave vector @xmath95 is a plane wave @xmath96 .",

    "we have considered in the expansion of the plane wave into bessel functions of integer order @xmath98 as many multipole terms as needed to exhaust the @xmath99-sum rule@xcite : @xmath100 = m_1^{(mm)}[e^{i \\vec{q}\\ , \\vec{r}}\\ , ] = q^2 \\frac{n}{2}\\ ; . \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] we infer from this figure that the modes have no appreciable wave - vector dispersion , a clear signature of the ` zero - dimensionality ' of the ring .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn for dots,@xcite in agreement with experiment.@xcite it can also be observed from this figure that a few number of multipoles ( up to @xmath101 for the largest @xmath87 value ) is enough to yield the plane wave response , and that in the @xmath97 long wave - length limit only the dipole @xmath102 mode contributes .    the @xmath1 dispersion of the dipole mode for the @xmath35 ring in the long wave - length limit is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "it is worth to see that edge modes have a smooth @xmath1 dispersion except in the regions where the ring is in the ferromagnetic @xmath76 phase .",

    ". the @xmath1 dependence of the absorption spectrum of a quasi ring - wire with two electrons was obtained@xcite by an exact diagonalization calculation , and it was shown to display fractionary ab oscillations of period @xmath82 .",
    "the ring - wire character of the system is crucial for it to present distinct ab oscillations .",
    "neither spin nor charge density modes with @xmath104 can be detected in fir spectroscopy . in contradistinction ,",
    "raman spectroscopy in qd s has proved to be able to disentangle spin from density modes , and to identify non - dipole charge and spin density modes.@xcite we show the charge and spin density strengths for @xmath105 nm@xmath106 in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , respectively . only modes up to the octupole ( @xmath107 ) mode are excited with some intensity .",
    "the octupole strength is very small because at @xmath105 nm@xmath106 it contributes very little to the bessel - function expansion of the plane wave in the region where the electronic density is concentrated , see fig .",
    "the monopole @xmath108 strength in the charge density channel has only one high - energy peak , whereas it is very fragmented in the spin density channel .",
    "we have identified the polarization of the main peaks with a @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) sign when the peak arise from @xmath111 changes in orbital angular momentum .",

    "it can be noted that the discontinuities in the energy of the inner edge dipole mode ( @xmath110 ) we have discussed in the long wave - length limit ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) are well visible .",
    "for quadrupole modes , at some @xmath1 values we have found more than one single intense peak of a give polarization ( see also fig . [ fig7 ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "the more intense peak is indicated by a full symbol , and the less intense peak by an open symbol .    at high magnetic fields , the positive @xmath1 dispersion cde s and sde s",
    "have a clear tendency to bundle .",
    "these peaks arise from interband transitions whose landau index differs in one unit . as explained in ref .",
    "for the case of dots , this happens because the landau bands are made of many sp states with different @xmath52 values and energies rather @xmath52 independent if @xmath1 is large enough",
    ". only finite - size effects and the @xmath116 dependence of the electron - hole interaction cause some dependence on the mode multipolarity .",
    "the origin of the high energy , weak quadrupole cde s are excitations involving interband transitions whose landau index differs in two units .",
    "notice also that the quadrupole spin density strength is very fragmented , especially around the @xmath117 t ferromagnetic region .",
    "it is interesting to notice that ` @xmath110 ' edge modes only appear in the dipole case . recalling that these are inner edge modes , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] helps to understand this finding .",
    "it can be seen that only the @xmath108 and 1 multipoles of the plane wave expansion are sizeable in the inner edge region , and as a consequence , the strength of the @xmath118 component with @xmath119 goes to the high energy mode of the same polarization . in contradistinction ,",
    "the ` @xmath109 ' outer edge mode has no high - energy counterpart and takes the whole strength of the @xmath120 component .",
    "the high sensitivity of the ` @xmath110 ' edge modes to the ring morphology might help to shed light into the actual structure of the ring inner edge@xcite .",
    "we recall that the experimental nanoscopic rings@xcite have been fabricated from inas self - assembled dots grown on gaas covered by a thin layer of gaas by an annealing process .",
    "the existence of ferromagnetic phases causes the coupling of spin and charge density responses .",
    "this effect can be detected experimentally , and as a matter of fact , it has been observed in qd s using raman spectroscopy.@xcite this means that in the spin density channel , besides the main sde s , a spin - dependent external field excites other low intensity peaks lying at the energy of the more intense cde s which appear in the charge density channel , and conversely .",
    "the coupling of cde s and sde s has been thoroughly discussed within tdlsdtf in refs . and for qd s , and in ref . for antidots .",
    "an example of how this coupling looks like for rings is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , where we show the charge and spin dipole modes near @xmath121 t. one can see that both responses are decoupled if the gs is paramagnetic , as it is at @xmath122 t , and are coupled if the gs is ferromagnetic , as it is at @xmath123 t , for example .",
    "the existence of islands of spin - triplet gs s of rather wide @xmath1-extension is a characteristic of nanoscopic rings which mesoscopic rings hosting several thousand electrons lack of .",
    "indeed , only for few electron rings the spin polarization @xmath124 is sizeable in the triplet state , a @xmath125 for the @xmath35 ring .",
    "large couplings only arise from large spin polarizations through the spin dependence of the exchange - correlation potential@xcite .    finally , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] a grey - scale plot of the raman strength in the charge ( left panel ) and spin density channels ( right panel ) corresponding to the @xmath126 t region .",
    "this figure clearly reveals the st and ts transition points as discontinuities in the @xmath1 dispersion of the multipole modes , especially visible in the inner edge dipole mode .",
    "these discontinuities are fingerprints of gs spin transitions and could be detected in raman experiments .",
    "in this work we have studied physical aspects of charge and spin density responses of nanoscopic rings that might be detected by raman spectroscopy .",
    "we have considered rings whose morphology is close to that of the systems recently fabricated , excluding for this reason the interesting case of nanoscopic ring - wires that can also be addressed using the same method .",
    "we have taken as case of study a ring with 10 electrons and have seen that monopole to quadrupole modes clearly appear in the spin , and especially in the charge density channel .",
    "both channels are coupled if the gs is ferromagnetic , and the st and ts transition points may be identified as discontinuities in the @xmath1 dispersion of the multipole modes .",
