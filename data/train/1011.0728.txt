    "with the lhc running smoothly and the `` re - discovery '' of the standard model ( sm ) well underway , it is time to contemplate what new physics this early lhc run might access .",
    "a significant amount of data ( @xmath1 ) will be accumulated at @xmath2 , and it is important to consider what kinds of physics beyond the sm can be studied at this energy and luminosity , particularly with several years wait until the anticipated @xmath3 run .",
    "the models of greatest interest in this regard are those that will be accessible to early lhc running but are outside of the range of the tevatron .",
    "the first and simplest target for new physics searches will be resonance searches",
    ". the drell - yan channel into leptons will likely be the simplest channel to study , since the sm contributions are well - understood , the background is very low at high invariant mass , and many models of new physics have sizeable branching fractions to leptons , particularly muons",
    ". our focus will therefore be on muons , though we will also briefly consider the additional contributions from electrons or photons that could be present and increase discovery reach .",
    "muon detector efficiencies and resolutions are very good at both cms and atlas , as are those for electrons .",
    "however , models involving strong electron couplings are generally tightly constrained by lep , making dimuon searches more interesting in those cases .",
    "the production of strongly - interacting final states ( such as @xmath4 ) could also be of interest , as they are enhanced by a color factor , but this advantage is typically negated by higher qcd backgrounds , lower efficiencies , and worse resolution , so we will not consider these further .    the @xmath5 nature of the tevatron ensures that it will serve as the best probe of neutral resonances below 1 tev .",
    "the lhc will nonetheless dominate for other cases due to the higher center - of - mass ( cm ) energy .",
    "this makes high - mass resonances , which were out of the tevatron s reach , kinematically accessible .",
    "furthermore , the large gluonic parton fraction at low @xmath6 means that resonances coupling to gluons ( such as kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) framework ) will have enhanced cross sections over the tevatron .",
    "even so , to be visible with only @xmath7 of data , large couplings to leptonic final states are most likely essential .",
    "since the width of a resonance scales as the square of the coupling , this implies that , during the early lhc running , we will find broad resonances with large decay widths .",
    "broad resonances are more challenging to study than narrow ones . with narrow resonances ,",
    "the invariant mass of the signal events are tightly clustered around the particle s mass . for muons ,",
    "the detector resolution is sufficiently good that performing a simple counting experiment in the region around the resonance pole ( with a width on the order of the muon resolution ) often gives a signal - to - background ratio that is high enough for detection .",
    "detecting broad resonances will be more challenging since signal events are spread out over a wider area so the signal will not be as clearly identifiable by its shape .",
    "distinguishing signal from background is further complicated by parton distribution uncertainties in the high invariant mass region , as well as uncertainties in the integrated luminosity , both of which are often estimated using the drell - yan process that we re using as a probe of new physics .",
    "the question then becomes whether or not we can distinguish these events from background or other forms of strongly - interacting physics such as contact interactions . in this paper",
    "we show that characteristic features of the invariant mass distribution will be sufficient to find and identify resonances , even at the first run of the lhc . in its simplest form ,",
    "our method involves looking for an absolute rise in the differential cross section , or `` upturn '' , which would clearly distinguish any new physics from the sm or a contact interaction , both of which predict a falling distribution .",
    "our fuller , more sophisticated statistical analysis uses the maximum likelihood method to distinguish between resonances and contact interactions ( of which the sm is the limiting case where we take the contact interaction scale @xmath8 ) and covers a greater parameter range .",
    "we demonstrate that differentiating a broad resonance from background and contact interactions is possible over much of the accessible range of parameter space with a significant number of signal events .",
    "we also use angular distributions to further distinguish new physics models from one another and from the sm .",
    "we study the muon pseudorapidity ( @xmath9 ) distribution , and demonstrate that a variable we call ellipticity can be used to distinguish among different chiral structures .",
    "we find that ellipticity is good at distinguishing models with different parity violation , whereas observables based on the muon angle in the cm frame ( @xmath10 ) are more useful for spin determination .",
    "model discrimination based on angular information generally requires more events than will be accessible in the first lhc run for resonance masses larger than 1 tev , so we also consider the prospects of model discrimination with @xmath11 and different integrated luminosities .",
    "our analysis follows others who have investigated the lhc reach of @xmath12 gauge bosons during the @xmath2 run with various integrated luminosities @xcite .",
    "we extend these analyses to include searches for rs kk gravitons , and widen the study to include strongly - coupled , broad resonances .",
    "we begin our work by motivating the fundamental question addressed in this paper : can we distinguish resonances from contact interactions in the 7 tev run of the lhc ?",
    "for concreteness , we examine @xmath12 models and kk gravitons within the rs framework ( we will describe the details of these models in section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "as we will demonstrate in section [ sec : xsec ] , the largest accessible regions of parameter space in the early running of the lhc will be strongly coupled , resulting in a broad resonance .    as the coupling of the theory increases , the resulting resonance broadens and flattens , losing its distinctive `` bump '' , and instead begins to look more and more like background , a contact interaction , or some other new physics that predicts excess events at high invariant mass . nonetheless ,",
    "discriminating a resonance from other possible models ( including the sm ) should be possible for many of the broad resonance models we study , although it is not _ a priori _ obvious that this is the case . to show why model discrimination may be difficult , we plot the differential cross section for both rs and @xmath12 resonances in fig .",

    "@xmath12 phenomenology is dictated by the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath15 . in our analysis",
    ", we consider all values of these parameters consistent with experimental constraints .",
    "to observe higher - mass resonances , the coupling @xmath15 must be sufficiently large to compensate for the small parton luminosity , meaning that the @xmath12 models most visible during the early lhc running will be broad . even at large coupling , and our conclusion remains the same . ]",
    "the only rigorous constraint on @xmath12 couplings comes from anomaly cancelation requirements .",
    "these can be satisfied in myriad ways - for instance , by the presence of hidden exotic states - but the simplest are `` minimal models '' , which consist purely of couplings to the sm plus right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the minimal models allow us to adequately study the various @xmath12 possibilities in a systematic way without introducing too many additional parameters , and we will restrict our attention to these .",
    "anomaly cancelation then limits the overall charges to a linear combination of two independent charge assignments : hypercharge and @xmath25 .",
    "the hypercharge component leads to mixing with the @xmath48 and is tightly constrained by lep measurements . in order to study @xmath12 models with stronger coupling to the sm",
    ", we will focus on @xmath12 of the @xmath25 type . strictly speaking",
    ", the couplings will mix under renormalization group running @xcite , so @xmath12 models that unify with the sm at the gut scale will generically see both types of charges , but this effect is small and , for the purposes of lhc phenomenology , we can ignore higher energies and simply examine the couplings at the tev scale .",
    "although not as tightly constrained as a @xmath12 that couples to hypercharge , @xmath25 models are also strongly constrained by electroweak data if they are flavor - universal due to the constraints on electron - quark 4-fermion operators from lep .",
    "if we only consider flavor - universal models , the lep constraints are sufficiently strong to exclude all broad resonances with @xmath49 mass , and since these are the only type that will be visible in early lhc running , there will be no new parameter space open for exploration .",
    "a way around this is to couple the @xmath12 exclusively to muons in the leptonic sector @xcite ; the theory will still be anomaly - free if the charges are @xmath26 .",
    "these non - universal models evade the bounds from lep while giving large branching fraction to muon final states , enhancing the visible signal at the lhc .",
    "this means that there are regions of the parameter space that are accessible at the early lhc but that have not already been excluded at lep .",
    "our analysis generalizes that of @xcite pertaining to @xmath12 coupling to @xmath26 , considering in particular the case of broad resonances and its experimental implications",
    ".      many of the best - motivated theories of new physics are those providing a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "one class of examples are rs models , in which the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak scales is established with the addition of a warped extra dimension and the higgs field confined to a brane at the ir scale @xcite . for theories with the entire sm confined to the tev brane , kk modes of the graviton could be detectable in early running if the tev - brane energy scale is sufficiently low .",
    "the couplings of higher kk modes of the graviton are suppressed by the warped scale @xmath50 . here",
    ", @xmath51 is the ads curvature scale and @xmath52 is the radius of the compact dimension .",
    "if the hierarchy problem is solved , then @xmath53 .",
    "the lagrangian for the coupling of the kk graviton modes is @xmath54 with energy - momentum tensor @xmath55 and @xmath56-th kk graviton @xmath57 .",
    "the free parameters in this model can be taken to be @xmath51 and @xmath58 ; for phenomenological reasons , it is more convenient to exchange these for the dimensionless parameter @xmath59 and the first kk graviton mass @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the first zero of the bessel function @xmath62 .",
    "the subscript @xmath63 is used for the first mode because it is the graviton mode that will first appear at the lhc , and higher modes will likely be too heavy for discovery in the early running .",
    "these parameters are better - motivated from the standpoint of a resonance search and are directly analogous to the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath34 in @xmath12 models .    as with the @xmath12 , we compute the partonic and hadronic cross sections for lepton production  here via kk graviton exchange . for both gluon- and quark - initiated processes , the partonic cross section takes the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the graviton self - energy . on - resonance , or in the narrow width approximation ,",
    "the self - energy contribution can be simplified to give @xmath66 where the graviton partial width to final states of mass @xmath31 scales as @xmath67.\\ ] ]    the partonic cross section evaluated at the pole is @xmath68 and the hadronic cross section is @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "this behavior is clearly analogous to that for a @xmath12 , and we are likewise led to the conclusion that strongly - coupled physics and broad resonances will appear first at the lhc .",
    "many analyses , beginning with @xcite , consider only rs models with coupling @xmath71 due to perturbativity constraints , restricting their studies to narrow resonances .",
    "this constraint , which comes from bounding the tree - level ads curvature @xmath72 , neglects loop effects and is likely overly conservative .",
    "we now discuss contact interactions in more detail , as we saw in section [ sec : resorcontact ] that , with small statistics , they might be confused with broad resonances .",
    "contact interactions are convenient for parameterizing the low - energy behavior of new physics contributions .",
    "we consider generic contact interactions that are consistent with current experimental data and remain agnostic about possible uv completions of the theory .",
    "the contact interactions most relevant to us are those involving quarks and muons .",
    "they are defined by a scale @xmath73 , and we use the parameterization @xcite @xmath74.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 or 0 and can give chiral or axial / vector - like couplings .",
    "models with a vector - like coupling , denoted by vv , will have all couplings set to 1 or @xmath76 , each with the same sign .",
    "a left - handed model , denoted by ll , has only one non - zero coupling , @xmath77 , and thus only couples to left ( right ) handed quarks ( anti - quarks ) and muons ( anti - muons ) .",
    "for these two models , the signs of the @xmath0 s determine the nature of the interference with the sm .",
    "the sm is recovered in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "the contact interaction ( [ eq : contact ] ) arises from integrating out some spin-1 degrees of freedom .",
    "this seems like the best choice for mimicking a @xmath12 resonance , but at first glance , it may seem that a contact interaction generated by integrating out spin-2 degrees of freedom might do better at faking a graviton resonance .",
    "such contact interactions , however , are dimension 8 and suppressed by extra powers of the scale @xmath73 . as a result , the event rate from such operators will not compete with the event rate from a broad resonance without running into serious conflict with existing experimental bounds .",
    "thus , we find that even for rs gravitons , the interaction ( [ eq : contact ] ) is the best basis for comparison ( we may also wish to consider scalar - type couplings , but as in the high energy limit , this only affects the angular distribution , we do not consider them here ) .",
    "the current goal for early lhc running is @xmath7 at @xmath2 . to get a sense of the ultimate lhc reach , however , and also to see qualitatively what the possible outcomes of resonance searches may be at later times , we consider both the early run and also the cross sections at @xmath78 and @xmath79 , even though the analyses presented in this paper are mostly concerned with the first case .",
    "we consider the rs and @xmath12 models discussed in section [ sec : models ] for different values of the mass and coupling . as anticipated in section [ sec : resorcontact ] , we demonstrate that the largest cross sections are in regions of parameter space with broad resonances , leading to the question of model discrimination between the broad resonance and a contact interaction that will be addressed in section [ sec : discrimination ] .     with @xmath25 charges to sm .",

    "our upper cut - off for the window of integration will be @xmath40 , the cm energy of the collider .",
    "we do not exclude any regions of parameter space solely for reasons of theoretical prejudice , but consider only experimental constraints .",
    "the most important ones for our study will be the bounds on 4-fermion operators from lep @xcite and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the bounds from lep in particular strongly constrain new physics coupling to electrons , such as the @xmath12 coupling to @xmath25 .",
    "one exception is the rs kk graviton that we have been discussing .",
    "it couples to the energy - momentum tensor and the lowest - dimension operator contributing to @xmath91-channel graviton exchange is dimension 8 , which is much less strongly constrained than the dimension-6 operators generated by massive vector exchange .",
    "we also consider the strongest direct bounds on neutral resonances , which come from the tevatron @xcite .",
    "these direct bounds do not extend much beyond 1 tev because the tevatron parton luminosity falls off very rapidly above this scale .",
    "finally , we incoporate the bounds from muon @xmath92 experiments @xcite , although these do not strongly constrain rs models due to the cut - off dependence of the graviton contribution to @xmath92 , and so there are many values of @xmath93 and @xmath59 that can give the correct contribution .",
    "for @xmath12 models , the constraints from 4-fermion operators are stronger than those from @xmath92 .",
    "as a simple first attempt at studying the shape of the distribution , we take advantage of one of the defining characteristics of a resonance : namely , the accompanying `` bump '' , or absolute rise and fall in the cross section",
    ". the background ( or a contact interaction ) will never actually give an increase in the cross section .",
    "_ _ we therefore look at regions of parameter space where we can , with @xmath94 confidence , say that there is a rise in the cross section over a flat background , indicative of a resonance with reasonable certainty .",
    "we find that for both kk gravitons and @xmath12 , the upturn analysis works for masses up to 1.5 - 2 tev , and widths up to about 40% for @xmath12 and 90% for rs , depending on the mass .",
    "to determine the reach of this analysis , we search for the local minimum of the differential cross section , as well as the corresponding point on the other side of the putative resonance peak .",
    "we then compute the integrated cross section in this region and compare it to a conjectured flat background .",
    "if we see a @xmath94 excess of events , then we know to a very high degree of confidence that we are seeing something new , since nowhere in the sm do we expect to see such behavior .",
    "we present our results for the upturn analysis at @xmath7 at the 7 tev lhc in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsupturn ] .",
    "the behavior is as expected for narrow resonances , where nearly all of the signal events are above the upturn in cross section , and so the upturn analysis works everywhere that a normal counting experiment would . for very broad resonances ( this definition depends on the precise model and resonance mass , but",
    "typically involves a ratio of width to mass that is larger than 50% for rs and 30% for @xmath12 ) , the convolution with the falling parton luminosity function results in fewer events above the upturn ( and , in some cases , no upturn at all ) , and they can not be reached by this analysis .",

    "we expect that the lhc reach for broad resonances should be more extensive than that shown here .",
    "another shortcoming of this analysis is that it fails to account for statistical fluctuations in determining the start and endpoints for the integration window .",
    "an upturn could just as well come from a downward fluctuation in the lower - invariant - mass region , and our analysis does not consider this possibility .",

    "since the @xmath104 distribution is dependent on the bin means , which in turn are functions of the parameters of the theory , we have a different distribution of @xmath104 for each set of parameters .",
    "we therefore have no choice but to generate these through monte carlo simulations",
