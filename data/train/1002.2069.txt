    "the star galex  j193156.8 + 011745 ( hereafter galex  j1931 + 0117 ) is a hydrogen - rich white dwarf recently identified in a joint ultraviolet / optical survey @xcite based on the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) all - sky survey and the gsc2.3.2 catalogue . the third u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog locates the star at r.a.(2000)@xmath0 , dec.(2000)@xmath1 with a proper motion of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mas  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the distance modulus implies that the star is nearby ( @xmath5 pc ) and that it is imbedded in the galactic plane ( @xmath6 pc ) .",
    "based on echelle spectroscopy we show that galex  j1931 + 0117 is a daz white dwarf and is one of the most extreme cases of externally polluted white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the daz white dwarf atmospheres are hydrogen - dominated with heavy element abundances ranging from nearly solar down to detection limits several orders of magnitude below solar @xcite .",
    "the daz and , more particularly , the dz phenomena are interpreted as evidence of on - going accretion of circumstellar material onto white dwarf atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the source of the material has been ascribed to comets @xcite and more recently to tidally - disrupted asteroids ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although close , low - mass companions in post - common envelope binaries are also a known source of material @xcite .    the observational evidence in favour of the accretion of debris material resides in ( 1 ) the inferred composition of the accretion flow @xcite showing an overabundance of refractory elements ( see a discussion on the solar system by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 2 ) the direct spectroscopic signature of gaseous discs as in the cases of sdss  j122859.93 + 104032.9 and sdss  j104341.53 + 085558.2 @xcite or dusty discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accreted material may also be supplied by mass loss from a close , low - mass , and possibly substellar companion .",
    "only a few substellar companion to white dwarf stars are known such as the white dwarf plus l8 - 9 resolved pair phl  5028 @xcite or close da plus l8 post - common envelope binary wd0137@xmath7349 @xcite .",
    "relatively luminous daz white dwarfs such as eg  102 @xcite may hide low - mass companions , but @xcite limits them to substellar types . the mass loss material captured by the deep potential well of a white dwarf should reflect the composition of the chromosphere of the red dwarf , which , in most cases , should be close to solar .    in this context ,",
    "the discovery of the peculiar daz white dwarf galex  j1931 + 0117 is timely .",
    "we present a series of ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical and near infrared ( nir ) observations ( section 2 ) and our model atmosphere analysis ( section 3.1 ) revealing a daz white dwarf with a peculiar abundance pattern ( section 3.2 ) . a notable nir excess ( section 3.3 ) may hold clues concerning the nature of this external source .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section 4 .",
    "@xcite describe a selection of hot sub - luminous stars in a joint _ galex_/gsc2.3.2 survey .",
    "briefly , a uv excess along with measurable proper - motion is interpreted as a likely , but not definitive , characteristic of hot subdwarfs ( sdb , sdo ) or white dwarfs . to confirm the selection ,",
    "follow - up spectroscopy was done for a number of candidates including galex  j1931 + 0117 .",
    "we obtained two low - dispersion spectra ( @xmath8 s ) using efosc2 attached to the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 august 25 ( grating # 11 , dispersion @xmath9   pixel@xmath4 ) .",
    "the spectral coverage is from 3680 to 7408  at a resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "following the identification of galex  j1931 + 0117 as a daz white dwarf we obtained three echelle spectra ( @xmath11 s ) using uves attached to the vlt - kueyen on ut 2009 november 12 ( dispersion @xmath120.02   pixel@xmath4 ) .",
    "the first two echelle spectra were obtained with the red arm and cover the ranges 5698 - 7532  and 7660 - 9464 .",
    "a third spectrum obtained with the blue arm covers the range 3757 - 4985 .",
    "we collected the jhk photometry from the 2mass survey @xcite and the _ galex _ photometry , corrected for nonlinearity @xcite , from the gr4 + 5 release . despite a reddening index of @xmath13 @xcite in the line of sight toward galex  j1931 + 0117",
    ", the star is relatively nearby and does not show the effect of reddening ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "finally , we used the acquisition images ( v filter ) at ntt to measure the apparent magnitude of galex  j1931 + 0117 .",
    "we employed the acquisition images of the flux calibration standard feige 110 ( @xmath15 ) and eg  21 ( @xmath16 ) obtained on the same night at the ntt to calibrate the measured counts and derive the v magnitudes .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] summarises the available photometric measurements .",
    "the field surrounding galex  j1931 + 0117 is somewhat crowded with objects 4.8 and 8.3@xmath17 away .",
    "these separations are sufficient to exclude significant flux contamination in the optical and infrared images .",
    "the ultraviolet ( fuv and nuv ) images are possibly contaminated .",
    "however , the optical / infrared indices imply that the nearby stars are not significant ultraviolet sources .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] compares the spectral energy distribution from the uv to the nir to computed composite spectra . adopting class averages of @xmath23 and 14.0 for l2 , l4 , l5 , and l6 , respectively @xcite , we scaled corresponding l templates from the iac m - l - t dwarf catalog @xcite to a distance of 55 pc , and added the flux to the projected nir continuum of the daz white dwarf",
    ". the measured excess would correspond to a l5 dwarf with @xmath24 k @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the predicted l5 and daz velocity semi - amplitudes are @xmath27 kms@xmath4 and @xmath28 kms@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "radial velocity shifts in the white dwarf spectra may be detectable in future observations",
    ". the presence of a close l dwarf companion should lead to notable optical / infrared light variations .",
    "in particular , variable h@xmath29 emission is a noted spectroscopic signature of post - common envelope systems ( e.g. , wd0137@xmath7349 , * ? ? ? * ) , but it is not apparent in any of our spectra",
    ".    we can not exclude the presence of a dusty circumstellar environment in addition to a l dwarf companion .",
    "however , by showing a steeper decline over the h- and k - bands the nir spectral energy distribution of galex  j1931 + 0117 appears different than that of the warm , dusty white dwarf sdss  j122859.93 + 104032.9 @xcite . if present , dust should reside at a distance from the star where the equilibrium temperature between dust and stellar radiation is below the sublimation temperature , @xmath30 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for @xmath30 between 1350 and 1650 k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the minimum distance from galex  j1931 + 0117 or sdss  j122859.93 + 104032.9 is between 1.7 and 1.1 @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the gaseous and dusty discs in sdss  j122859.93 + 104032.9 co - exist at a distance @xmath32 from the white dwarf .",
    "although galex  j1931 + 0117 and sdss  j122859.93 + 104032.9 have nearly identical luminosities , the lack of a gaseous disc in the former and the dissimilarity of their nir spectral energy distributions imply different environments .",
    "we identified and analysed the properties of one of the most heavily polluted white dwarfs known .",
    "the source of the material remains unknown , although the measured nir excess may be attributed to a l5 dwarf or to a warm debris disc .",
    "the measured abundances suggest that the material is accreted onto the atmosphere in solar proportions and favour a model involving a l dwarf companion in a close orbit .",
    "however , the h@xmath29 emission notable in such systems is absent in galex  j1931 + 0117 and the mass loss imposed on the companion appears excessive .",
    "nir intermediate dispersion spectroscopy should help determine the nature of the accretion source .",
    "additional optical spectra will be useful to trace putative orbital motions while space telescope imaging spectrograph high - dispersion spectra will be useful to constrain further the carbon abundance and extend the pattern to less abundant elements .",
