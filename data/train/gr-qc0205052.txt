    "this article represents the second part of our series on cosmological models within alternative gravity theories . in the first part @xcite",
    ", we presented a cosmological model in weyl - cartan spacetime which is no longer tied to a riemannian spacetime and is based on an alternative gravity theory , so - called metric - affine gravity ( mag ) , which was essentially developed by hehl and has been extensively reviewed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we derived the field equations of our new model and provided exact solutions for a rather broad class of parameters .",
    "we were able to show that it is possible to construct models in which the non - riemannian quantities die out with time .    within this work",
    "we investigate the observational consequences of the new model , and try to rule out if it is compatible with current observations .",
    "as becomes clear from the title we are interested in the derivation of the so - called magnitude - redshift relation , which establishes a relation between the luminosity and distance of a given object and the parameters within the underlying cosmological model .",
    "this relation was successfully used to extract parameters within the cosmological standard model , also known as friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model @xcite , which is based on general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "recent observations @xcite of type ia supernovae , which are believed to be some kind of _ standard candles _ , led to the unexpected discovery that we seem to live in an universe which is currently undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion @xcite . the availability of a data set incorporating over 90 type ia supernovae has turned the magnitude - redshift relation into a cosmological test which must be passed by any new model .",
    "it interesting to test if predictions , like the one that the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating , still hold in case of our weyl - cartan model .",
    "therefore we put special emphasis on the model dependence of certain assumptions which are made during the derivation of the magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the analysis of the sne data led to a renewed interest in the cosmological constant @xmath0 within the cosmological standard model . since the cosmological constant seems to be a concept which re - emerges periodically within cosmology it is interesting to figure out if it is also inevitable for the description of the data within an alternative model .",
    "note that there are also several efforts , cf .",
    "@xcite e.g. , to cope with the new observational situation , which do not focus on a change of the underlying cosmological model .",
    "although parts of this work are based on the results obtained in @xcite , it should also be of use for the reader who wants to learn more about the derivation and the use of the magnitude - redshift relation within the standard flrw model . at this point",
    "we like to mention that the model in weyl - cartan spacetime still has toy model character , since many important issues are not yet worked out .",
    "hence this article represents a first attempt to rule out whether our new model is viable when confronted with the currently available observational data from the type ia supernovae .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ mag_redshit_in_standard_model ]",
    "we review some standard concepts of the flrw model and introduce the notions and assumptions which are necessary to derive the magnitude - redshift relation within this model . in section [ extweyl_magnitude_redshift_relation ] we make use of these results in order to derive this relation within the new weyl - cartan model .",
    "we perform fits within the flrw as well as within the weyl - cartan model to the combined data set of wang @xcite in section [ numerical_results_section ] .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the results of several other groups who performed similar analysis within the flrw as well as in non - standard model and draw our conclusion in section [ conclusion_section ] . in [ natural_units ]",
    ", we provide an overview over the units used throughout the preceding sections .",
    "in this section we present a short derivation of the magnitude - redshift relation within the standard flrw model .",
    "the results obtained here will be of use when we perform our analysis within the new weyl - cartan model in the next section .",
    "in particular we will stress the model dependence of the magnitude - redshift relation in the following section , especially its entanglement with the field equations .",
    "since the upcoming derivation of the field equations can be found in every standard textbook on cosmology we keep ourselves rather short . for further reading the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy leads to the so - called robertson - walker metric as starting point .",
    "using spherical coordinates @xmath1 and the coframe @xmath2 the line element is given by @xmath3 the function @xmath4 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath5 can be chosen to be @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 for spaces of constant positive , negative , or zero spatial curvature , respectively .",
    "the only thing missing in order to set up the field equations is an appropriate matter model . following the cosmological standard model",
    ", we assume that matter is smoothly smeared out over the whole spacetime .",
    "thus , we choose the energy - momentum 3-form of an ideal fluid with pressure @xmath9 , energy - density @xmath10 , and four - velocity @xmath11 , i.e.   @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 the einstein field equations with cosmological constant read : @xmath15 here @xmath16 denotes the riemannian curvature 2-form , @xmath17 , @xmath0 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath18 is the gravitational coupling constant .",
    "insertion of the roberston - walker metric yields the following set of field equations ( the dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath19 ) @xmath20 hence the field equations ( [ field_eq_fluid_classic ] ) turned into a set of ordinary differential equations for the scale factor @xmath4 .",
    "the set of additional unknown parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 depends on the model we decide to consider .",
    "note that @xmath10 and @xmath9 are related by an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to the field equations ( [ friedman1])-([friedman2 ] ) we have one noether identity , which takes the following form in a riemannian spacetime @xmath24 let us assume that the equation of state takes the form @xmath25 @xmath26 , with @xmath27 @xmath28const . using ( [ spherical_coframe])([flrw_robertson_walker_line_element ] ) , and ( [ fluid_energy_3_form ] ) , equation ( [ flrw_first_noehter_riemannian ] ) turns into @xmath29 thus",

    "are related via a unique function @xmath33 , which is often called the _",
    "critical density_. the critical density is obtained via the first friedman equation ( [ friedman1 ] ) , in case of a vanishing cosmological constant we have ) , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the gravitational coupling constant becomes @xmath35 . ]",
    "@xmath36 this quantity is called critical density because of its character to distinguish between a open , flat , or closed universe , i.e.   @xmath37 as we can infer from ( [ critical_density_in_flrw_kapitel ] ) the critical density is determined by measuring the current value of the hubble function .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless _",
    "density parameter _",
    "@xmath38 , which represents the relationship between the actual and the critical density @xmath39 note that we use @xmath27 as an index since we did not specify the underlying equation of state . in case of a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath0 the first friedman equation might be written in terms of a total density parameter which encompasses both contributions , i.e.  @xmath40 , yielding @xmath41 note that the value of total density parameter distinguishes between the three possible geometries of the 3-dimensional subspace , i.e.   @xmath42      maybe one of the most striking properties of the cosmological standard model is the redshift due to the global expansion . in the following",
    "we will focus on its derivation by using our ansatz for the metric from equations ( [ spherical_coframe])([flrw_robertson_walker_line_element ] ) .",
    "the first assumption we make is that the propagation of light coming from a distant object , a galaxy e.g. , can be treated as a classical wave phenomenon . with @xmath43 being the radial coordinate of the object , @xmath44 coordinate of the observer",
    ", @xmath45 time at which wave is emitted , and @xmath46 at which the light is detected at @xmath44 , the robertson - walker line element yields @xmath47 thus , we gained a relation between the coordinate distance and the time , setting @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49 shifting the time of the emission @xmath50 will result in a shift of the detection time , i.e.  @xmath51 . since the lhs of ( [ flrw_redshift_function_of_distance_relation ] ) does not depend on the emission or detection time we can infer @xmath52 interpreting @xmath53 as the times between two wave crests at emission and at detection , i.e.  relating them to the wavelength @xmath54 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath55 using the common astronomical definition of the redshift , i.e.@xmath56 we find the following relation between the scale factor and the redshift in a robertson - walker spacetime @xmath57 thus , if the universe is expanding , then distant sources should be redshifted .",
    "note that the derivation presented above makes use of three crucial assumptions : ( i ) the paths of photons are completely determined by the metric , ( ii ) the dispersion relation @xmath58 is valid at all times , and ( iii ) the observed wavelengths are small compared to the size of the universe .",
    "let us now derive an alternative form of the friedman equation .",
    "for that purpose we make use of the expression for the redshift ( [ flrw_redshift_scale_factor_relation_final ] ) , and the relation between the scale factor and the density ( [ flrw_energy_density_scale_factor_relation_for_arbitrary_w_const ] ) . with @xmath59 equation ( [ flrw_first_friedman_written_with_omega_total ] ) turns into @xmath60 for normal matter ( @xmath61 ) we can rewrite the friedman equation as follows @xmath62    \\nonumber , \\\\",

    "the deceleration parameter , which is commonly introduced when one expands the scale factor around a certain time ( cf .",

    "the astronomical definition reads @xmath68 thus , by measuring @xmath69 and with knowledge of @xmath70 ( via a standard candle , a supernova e.g. ) we are able to determine the distance @xmath71 .",
    "of course this distance definition implies that we know how much light is emitted by the source at least during a specific time interval .",
    "we will not investigate this question here any further since the search for an appropriate model of the source belongs to the realm of astrophysics ( a discussion of type ia supernova models can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the question we have to ask ourselves is : how is the luminosity distance related to parameters within the flrw model ? since energy is conserved the following equation is supposed to hold @xmath72 here @xmath73 denotes the area of the 2-sphere at the detection time @xmath46 , and @xmath53 , and @xmath74 the different length and time scales at emission and detection due to global expansion .",

    "there is an elegant way to rewrite the luminosity distance in terms of the density parameters , which makes use of the expression for the hubble parameter as derived in equation ( [ flrw_hubble_factor_in_terms_of_omega_lambda_omega_m ] ) .",
