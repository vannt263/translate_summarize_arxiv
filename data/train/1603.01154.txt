    "the study of effects due to fermionic fields in the background of defects , has been a subject of general interest in rather different areas , from the behavior of textures in superfluid phases of @xmath2 @xcite to cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "a representative of those phenomena is the callan - harvey effect @xcite , where a fermi field in an odd - dimensional spacetime couples to a defect , the latter corresponding to a mass term which changes sign along a domain wall . under these circumstances",
    ", the dirac field spawns a localized zero mode which may be capable of carrying currents when coupled to a gauge field .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens also in a non - relativistic two - dimensional electron gas in the presence of a magnetic field in the regime of the quantum hall effect , where those zero modes become the so called chiral edge states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate yet another effect due to the interplay between the fermionic field and domain walls , this time involving not just the presence of the zero mode , but also the quantum fluctuations of the fermionic field on top of the domain walls .",
    "this effect amounts to the emergence of non trivial contributions to the vacuum energy as a function of the wall(s ) geometry .",
    "one should indeed expect this kind of effect , since the existence of the walls produces a geometry dependent distortion of the vacuum fluctuation , a fertile set up for the induction of casimir - like effects .",
    "indeed , the quantum vacuum interaction between kinks of the sine - gordon equation has been evaluated in ref.@xcite using the tgtg - formula @xcite .",
    "this force is attractive , and it should be considered as a small quantum correction to the well known repulsive classical force between kinks @xcite .",
    "having in mind its potential application to graphene  @xcite , where some effective continuum models correspond to dirac fields in @xmath1 dimensions coupled to space - dependent masses  @xcite , we evaluate here some effects due to the vacuum ( i.e. , zero temperature ) quantum fluctuations of a dirac field in the presence of domain walls @xcite .",
    "since there is no reason a priori to assume that just the zero modes are relevant to this effect , we will include all the modes .",
    "effective continuum models for graphene using dirac fields generally involve not just a single @xmath0-component field , but an even number of them , what amounts to putting the dirac field in a reducible representation of poincar s group in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , since those models can be constructed in terms of decoupled @xmath0-component fields in a rather straightforward way , we will consider just the latter , i.e. , spinors in an irreducible representation . besides , the @xmath0 component case is relevant to other applications in condensed matter physics , like the above mentioned quantum hall effect case .",
    "the domain wall energy is usually described by means of an effective landau - ginzburg like functional of its shape ( assumed to be smooth ) . that functional could , at least in principle , be obtained from a detailed microscopic model for the system . in this context ,",
    "contributions depending on , for example , the crystal structure , should be quite relevant .",
    "we focus , in this work , on contributions to the domain wall energy , which should appear on top of the ones coming from the lattice structure .",
    "besides , we also obtain a result corresponding to two domain walls , whereby the dirac field is shown to induce an attractive , casimir - like force .",
    "this force does not have , to the best of our knowledge , an analogue within the context of the phenomenological model , since it is not a contact interaction which could be incorporated by means of a local term into the energy .",
    "for static - wall configurations , we shall see that the effective action predicts the existence of an effective interaction between domain - wall like defects in the mass ( the ` pseudo - gap ' ) .",
    "we also study the dependence of that interaction as a function of the geometry of the defects , at least under some simplifying assumptions and for particular cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : thesys ] we describe the kind of model that we consider in this article , introduce our notation and conventions , and define its effective action . as a warming up exercise we consider , in sect .",
    "[ sec : sw ] , the case of a single domain wall , namely , of a static mass that changes sign along a single spatial curve , having constant values ( and the same module ) everywhere else .",
    "the corresponding self - energy is divergent , even the contributions corresponding to small deformations of a rectilinear wall .",
    "we also verify , by coupling the field to an external gauge field , that the massless fermion mode is properly taken into account in our approach .    then in sect .",
    "[ sec : dw ] we deal with the situation of a static mass that changes sign on two spatial curves , also having the same constant value elsewhere .",
    "we compute exactly the interaction energy for the particular case of two straight lines , showing that the force between defects is always attractive . a perturbative expansion to treat cases when the shape of one of the rectilinear walls is slightly perturbed",
    "can be implemented .",
    "an appendix contains the details corresponding to the first and second order terms .",
    "[ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the system that we consider in this work is defined in terms of an euclidean action @xmath3 , given by : @xmath4 with @xmath5 , for a dirac field @xmath6 in the presence of a space dependent mass @xmath7 , in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we have adopted the convention that @xmath8 denotes the three euclidean spacetime coordinates , @xmath9 , while @xmath10 corresponds to just @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in the representation",
    "we adopt for dirac s algebra , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are hermitian @xmath15 matrices , satisfying .",
    "indices from the middle of the greek alphabet , like @xmath16 , @xmath17 ,  , run from @xmath18 to @xmath0 , while roman ones can take the values @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "the dirac field has two spinorial components , and it can be used as a building block for higher , reducible representations ( this is indeed the usual situation in graphene models ) .    regarding the specific form of the mass @xmath7",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves in this work to configurations such that almost everywhere , changing sign along a two - dimensional spacetime region @xmath20 which , for static domain walls , has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a one dimensional region contained on @xmath23 , the @xmath24 plane .",
    "for static configurations , @xmath22 is assumed , in this paper , to correspond to either a single curve , or to two disjoint regular curves . in the next sections , we discuss those two cases separately .",
    "we conclude this section by introducing the effective action , @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the euclidean vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude . from @xmath25 one can obtain the vacuum energy @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the extent of the time - like coordinate @xmath31 ( regarded temporarily as finite but tending to infinity to extract the vacuum energy ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath32 can be formally written in terms of a fermionic determinant ; indeed , @xmath33 note that the effective action is real ; indeed , since we work in the euclidean formalism , any imaginary part of @xmath25 , had it existed , should have been parity violating ( since the imaginary part of the action is parity violating ) .",
    "but no parity violating functional ( either local or nonlocal ) can be constructed in terms of just a scalar function and its derivatives . on the other hand , having in mind its application to graphene , the reducible representations used in that context for the fermions are such that the action is explicitly real ) .",
    "thus , having the above discussion in mind , we can write : @xmath34^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\ ;   \\big(\\det { \\mathcal h}\\big)^{1/2 } \\;=\\ ; \\big(\\det \\breve{\\mathcal h})^{1/2 } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 taking into account our assumptions about @xmath36 , we see that : @xmath37 since results that can be expressed in terms of @xmath38 are independent of the sign of @xmath39 , one can work with either @xmath40 or @xmath41 ; in the remainder of this paper , we use the former .",
    "thus , @xmath42",
    "we consider here a time - independent @xmath39 , i.e. , , which has a domain wall defect along a single closed curve @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , @xmath7 jumps from @xmath43 to @xmath44 when crossing @xmath22 ( physical observables , like the vacuum energy , are independent of the sign of the jump ) .    in order to gain some insight into the nature of the system ,",
    "let us define first the domain wall implicitly , in terms of a _ smooth _",
    "function @xmath45 , assumed to vanish with a non - zero gradient on @xmath22 .",
    "then we set ( @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 denotes the sign function .",
    "thus , we see that the operator @xmath40 introduced in ( [ eq : defh ] ) has the form : @xmath48 with @xmath49 \\,\\gamma_j \\partial_jf({\\mathbf x } ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes dirac s delta function , and @xmath51 is proportional to the ( omitted ) @xmath52 unit matrix .    by an application of the coarea formula , we note that @xmath53 can also be rendered in the form : , where @xmath54 \\ ;      \\hat{n}_i(\\tau ) \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath55 a parametrization of @xmath22 , and @xmath56 is the @xmath57 component of @xmath58 , the unit normal   are independent of the choice ( inwards or outwards ) for the normal . ] to @xmath22 at the point @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 \\ ; \\frac{dy_i(\\tau)}{d\\tau}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      as it should have been expected , it is far from trivial to calculate the effective action , and therefore the self - energy , exactly for an arbitrary closed curve @xmath22 . besides , one should expect the existence of infinities , due to the assumption that the defects have zero width .",
    "those infinities can nevertheless be regulated by the introduction of an uv cutoff which , in coordinate space , may be regarded as a non vanishing width for the defect . in the next section ,",
    "when dealing with the interaction between two defects , no cutoff dependence is expected in the interaction energy , since this object is independent of the respective self - energies .",
    "one can attempt to implement different approximation schemes in order to calculate @xmath38 ; the choice is determined , in the end , by the nature of the configuration being studied .",
    "the case we consider here corresponds to small - amplitude deviations with respect to a linear defect .",
    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath61 , expanding the effective action in powers of @xmath62 , which is the deviation with respect to the @xmath63 straight line .",
    "we first note that , with this choice of @xmath64 : @xmath65 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "denoting now by @xmath66 the order-@xmath67 term in the expansion for @xmath38 : @xmath68 we also have the corresponding expansion for the energy : @xmath69 where @xmath70 amounts to an uninteresting infinite constant independent of @xmath62 , which can be interpreted as coming from a linear energy density .",
    "the divergence is present already at the level of the energy density , which is cutoff dependent .",
    "regarding the first and second order terms , we see that , as a consequence of assuming that the functional expansion exists , they can be written as follows : @xmath71 since the functional expansion coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 are independent of @xmath62 , they must be translation invariant objects .",
    "thus , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the first - order term then has the form : @xmath76 namely , it depends only on the average value of the deformation @xmath62 .",
    "since this average value could be changed just by performing a rigid translation of the defect along the @xmath12 direction , and the energy can not change under such a shift , we conclude that @xmath72 , and therefore @xmath77 , vanishes .",
    "we have checked this explicitly , by evaluating @xmath78 , which , recalling ( [ eq : gammadet ] ) , is given by : @xmath79 \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath80 consistently denotes de order-@xmath81 term in an expansion of @xmath80 .",
    "the ones appearing here are : @xmath82 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the inverse of @xmath83 is given by @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "then , after some algebra , we find : @xmath88 \\delta'(y_2)\\big\\}\\big|_{y_2      \\to x_2}\\;=\\ ; 0 \\;,\\ ] ] as expected .",
    "we conclude this section by dealing with the second order term ; it is made up of two contributions : @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\      \\gamma_{2,2 } & = &   \\frac{1}{4}\\ ,       { \\rm tr}\\big [ \\big({\\mathcal h}_0\\big)^{-1 } \\ , { \\mathcal h}_1       \\big({\\mathcal h}_0\\big)^{-1 } \\ , { \\mathcal h}_1 \\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first contribution involves @xmath90 : @xmath91   \\;,\\ ] ] and yields an energy with the form : @xmath92 where @xmath93 \\delta''(y_2)\\big\\}\\big|_{y_2 \\to x_2 } \\;.\\ ] ] an explicit evaluation shows that the object above is quadratically divergent in the ultraviolet , namely , introducing an uv cutoff @xmath94 , @xmath95 with @xmath96 a dimensionless constant , which depends upon the regularization approach .",
    "thus , we conclude that the role of this term amounts to introducing a mass density proportional to @xmath97 for the collective degree of freedom .",
    "the remaining term , @xmath98 , can be evaluated and represented in fourier space , the result being a nonlocal quadratic functional in @xmath62 : @xmath99    from that expression , we can extract its local piece , quadratic in derivatives , which is logarithmically divergent : @xmath100 which may be thought of as generating a ` tension ' for the domain wall .",
    "note that the existence of an infrared divergence in the momentum integral can only proceed from the existence of a massless field , which we can readily identify here as corresponding to the one predicted by the callan and harvey mechanism .      when coupling the dirac field to an external abelian gauge field @xmath101 , we have to perform the following change in the operator @xmath102",
    ": @xmath103 then , assuming a rectilinear defect , the term of second order in @xmath101 , @xmath104 , will have the structure : @xmath105    it is convenient to perform a fourier transform of the objects above with respect to the @xmath31 and @xmath11 coordinates ( the defect breaks translation invariance along the @xmath12 axis ) : @xmath106 a straightforward calculation shows that the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath107 is given by : @xmath108 \\;,\\ ] ] with : @xmath109 having in mind to study the response of the system to an electric field along the direction and location of the defect , we consider the components @xmath110 , with @xmath111 in the @xmath112 range , and set @xmath113 . after a rather lengthy calculation",
    ", we see that the only surviving contributions to the vacuum polarization lead to : @xmath114 \\nonumber\\\\      & \\times       \\big [          \\frac{1}{(\\omega(p_\\parallel )   - m)(\\omega(p_\\parallel +          k_\\parallel )   - m ) } \\,+\\ ,          \\frac{1}{(\\omega(p_\\parallel )   + m)(\\omega(p_\\parallel +          k_\\parallel )   + m)}\\big ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be seen that the leading contribution proceeds from the first term on the second line above . in particular , for large @xmath115 :",
    "@xmath116 which is the expression for the vacuum polarization in @xmath117 dimensions , due to a massless fermion field .",
    "thus we have verified , in a concrete example , the presence of that mode in our treatment of the problem .",
    "in this section , the mass is assumed to have a purely spatial dependence , with two domain - wall like defects , i.e. , zero - width regions of space where the mass passes through zero .",
    "one of those regions will be assumed to correspond to a straight line , hereafter denoted by @xmath118 , defined by @xmath119 .",
    "the other defect , @xmath120 , is assumed to correspond to a curve which represents a small departure from a line which is parallel to @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that it can be defined in terms of a single function @xmath121 , which specifies the distance , along @xmath12 , of each point in @xmath120 to @xmath118 .",
    "thus , @xmath122 where , as before , @xmath47 denotes the sign function .",
    "@xmath115 is a positive constant which defines the constant value of the absolute value of @xmath7 , as well as half the height of the jump in the mass at each defect .",
    "the assumption about @xmath120 being a small departure from a straight line parallel to @xmath118 is made more precise by assuming that the above introduced function @xmath121 can be written as , with @xmath123 and .",
    "the effective action @xmath25 , can then be expanded in powers of @xmath124 , @xmath125 where the index denotes the order in @xmath124 of the corresponding term .",
    "we will evaluate here the zeroth order , and describe the calculation of the first and second orders in the appendix .",
    "the zeroth order corresponds to setting @xmath126 , so that the walls @xmath118 and @xmath120 will be located at @xmath119 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "the system has then translation invariance along @xmath11 , as well as time independence .",
    "the effective action to this order will then diverge , since it will be proportional to the extent of the time interval , @xmath30 , and to @xmath128 , the length of the system along @xmath11 , which should tend to infinity . as usual",
    ", one can take care of that divergence by considering the effective action per unit time and per unit length , a quantity which we shall denote by @xmath129 , and has the dimensions of an energy per unit length .",
    "that quantity , a function of @xmath130 and @xmath115 , contains the information about the interaction energy between the two domain walls , in particular on the part of that function which does depend on @xmath130 .",
    "self - energy contributions are @xmath130-independent and will be discarded . in other words , since the force per unit length between @xmath118 and @xmath120 is proportional to ( minus ) the derivative of @xmath131 with respect to @xmath130 , we only keep the terms which contribute to that observable .",

    ", we get for each scalar problem , the same contribution ( each one independent of the sign of @xmath115 ) .",
    "the expression for the energy density thus becomes : @xmath140 \\;.\\ ] ] by a rescaling of the integration variables , we can write : @xmath141     as a function of the dimensionless distance @xmath142 between planar domain walls .",
    ", width=377 ]    where @xmath143 is a dimensionless function of the only dimensionless function that can be formed with @xmath115 and @xmath130 .",
    "its explicit form can not be given in a closed form , but nevertheless it can be written as an integral : @xmath144 \\;.\\ ] ] in figure 1 we present a plot of the energy per unit area @xmath145 as a function of the distance between domain walls .",
    "it is a monotonous function , and produces a force which is always attractive .",
    "we have checked numerically that @xmath146 diverges as @xmath147 at short distances ( @xmath148 ) , and vanishes exponentially as @xmath149 in the opposite limit @xmath150 .",
    "the behavior at large distances is typical for the vacuum interaction energy associated to massive fields .",
    "it can also be obtained analytically by approximating @xmath151 in eq.([interplane ] ) , performing the integral up to a maximum value of @xmath152 of order @xmath115 , and then expanding the result for @xmath150 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the structure of the result for the vacuum interaction energy between domain walls , eq.([interplane ] ) , is similar to those obtained for the casimir effect for massive fermions between planar boundaries @xcite or in the presence of @xmath50-potentials @xcite .",
    "we have computed the effects of quantum fluctuations of a dirac scalar field in @xmath1 dimensions on domain wall defects . for a single defect ,",
    "the vacuum energy is highly divergent .",
    "we can understand the origin of the divergences as follows .",
    "had we considered a theory in which the fermion field is coupled to a dynamical scalar field whose classical part generates a smooth domain wall , the vacuum polarization of the fermion field would produce a renormalization of the mass of the scalar field as long as a finite correction to the mass of the domain wall . in the present paper",
    ", there is an additional source of divergences , because we are assuming a zero - width domain wall . for a nonplanar wall",
    ", we have found that the vacuum energy contains divergences that are proportional to @xmath153 and to @xmath154 .",
    "this indicates that in a dynamical model for the wall , there would be a renormalization of the mass and of the tension of the defect .",
    "we have seen that , part of this renormalization appears to be due to the fluctuations of the fermionic zero mode .",
    "we have verified this in an independent fashion , by computing the vacuum polarization tensor on the domain wall , that the virtual effects due to this mode are , indeed , present .    for two domain walls",
    ", we have shown that vacuum energy induces a casimir - like force between defects . for planar walls , the force could be computed using standard techniques based in the gelfand - yaglom theorem ; the result shows that it is always attractive . at short distances",
    ", it is inversely proportional to the distance , while vanishes exponentially at large distances .",
    "the divergences that occur in the vacuum energy for a single defect are not present in the interaction energy , which is moreover unambiguously defined .",
    "we remark that , in the graphene case one should multiply our result corresponding to the attractive force by the proper number of two - component fermions .",
    "we have also obtained explicit expressions for the interaction energy between a planar wall and a slightly deformed wall ( see the appendix ) . as for the usual casimir effect ,",
    "in this case the energy is a nonlocal functional of the deformation .",
    "in this appendix we compute the first and second order terms in the expansion of the effective action given in eq.([gammaexp ] ) .      the calculation of the first order term does not give a new result , but it can be used as a consistency check for the previous calculation . indeed , the contribution of first order in @xmath124 has the form : @xmath155\\ ] ] where . by taking the functional trace , after some algebra",
    "we see that the first order term in the energy per unit length is : @xmath156\\big|_{x_2=y_2=a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath157 ' denotes the trace over dirac indices . on the other hand , @xmath158 is the mean value of @xmath124 .    since the previous expression depends on @xmath124 only through the constant @xmath159 ,",
    "it is not sensible to the details of its local space dependence . therefore , it can be obtained from the zeroth order expression .",
    "indeed , one should have the relation : @xmath160 so that the first order term we are about to calculate should be compared with the one obtained by evaluating the derivative of the zeroth order term with respect to @xmath130 and multiplying by @xmath159 .",
    "one can show that : @xmath161 \\ ; \\langle x_2 | { \\mathcal k}^{-1 } | y_2 \\rangle \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is the operator introduced in the calculation of the zeroth order term .",
    "the inverse of the scalar operator above can be obtained by using standard techniques , and the result obtained by inserting it into the expression for the first order term is consistent with the relation obtained between it and the derivative of the zeroth order term .",
    "the second order term @xmath162 receives two different contributions : @xmath163 where : @xmath164\\ ] ] and @xmath165\\ ] ] it may be seen that @xmath166 can , like the first order term , be derived from the knowledge of the zeroth order term . in other words , it is only sensitive to the average value of @xmath124 . thus , we shall concentrate on @xmath167 , since it is the only one that contains new information to this order .",
    "we see that : @xmath168 \\big|_{x_2=y_2=a } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the system is now time - independent but translation invariance along @xmath11 is not necessarily preserved .",
