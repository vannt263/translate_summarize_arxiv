    "observational data from ia supernovae ( snia ) show that currently the observable universe is in accelerated expansion phase @xcite .",
    "this cosmic acceleration has also been confirmed by different observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the essence of this cosmic acceleration backs to `` dark energy '' , an exotic energy which generates a large negative pressure , whose energy density dominates the universe ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the astrophysical nature of dark energy confirms that it is not composed of baryonic matter .",
    "now from cosmological observations we know that the universe is spatially flat and consists of about 70% dark energy , 30% dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) and negligible radiation .",
    "but the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remains mysterious at present .",
    "one of the methods for constructing a dark energy model is to modify the geometrical part of the einstein equations .",
    "the general paradigm consists in adding into the effective action , physically motivated higher - order curvature invariants and non - minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "but if we relax the riemannian manifold , we can construct the models based on the torsion @xmath4 instead of the curvature .",
    "the representative models based on this strategy are termed ` modified gravity ' and include @xmath5 gravity @xcite , horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor gravity @xcite and the braneworld model @xcite and the newly @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theory of gravity is a meticulous class of modified theories of gravity .",
    "this theory can be obtained by replacing the torsion scalar @xmath4 in teleparallel gravity @xcite with an arbitrary function @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamical equations of motion can be obtained by varying the lagrangian with respect to the vierbein ( tetrad ) basis .",
    "wu et al have proposed viable forms of @xmath0 that can satisfy both cosmological and local gravity constraints @xcite .",
    "further capozziello et al discussed the cosmographical method for reconstruction of @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath0 model has some theoretical problems .",
    "for example it s not locally lorentz invariance , possesses extra degrees of freedom , violate the first law of thermodynamics and inconsistent hamiltonian formalism @xcite .    in the past",
    ", the use of scalar fields in certain physical theories , especially particle physics , has been explored .",
    "this led to study the role of scalar fields in cosmology as well .",
    "recently some of the present authors investigated the behavior of scalar fields in @xmath0 cosmology . in @xcite",
    ", we introduced a non - minimally conformally coupled scalar field and dark matter in @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "we investigated the stability and phase space behavior of the parameters of the scalar field by choosing an exponential potential and cosmologically viable form of @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the dynamical system of equations admit two unstable critical points ; thus no attractor solution existed in that model . in another investigation @xcite",
    ", we studied the noether symmetries ( which are symmetries of the lagrangian ) of @xmath0 involving matter and dark energy . in that model ,",
    "the dark energy was considered as a canonical scalar field with a potential .",
    "the analysis showed that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore it becomes meaningful to reconstruct a scalar potential @xmath8 in the framework of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "it was demonstrated that dark energy driven by scalar field , decays to cold dark matter in the late accelerated universe and this phenomenon yields a solution to the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the noether gauge symmetries ( ngs ) of the model , which provide a more general notion of the noether symmetry .",
    "this approach is useful in obtaining physically viable choices of @xmath0 , and has been previously used for the @xmath5 gravity and generalized saez - ballester scalar field model as well @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we present the formal framework of the @xmath0 action minimally coupled with a scalar field . in section iii , we construct the governing differential equations from the noether condition and solve them in an accompanying subsection . in section iv , we study the dynamics of the present model . finally we conclude this work . in all later sections ,",
    "we choose units @xmath9 .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the validity equivalence principle , we must work with a gauge theory for gravity and such a gauge theory is possible only on curved manifold .",
    "construction of a gauge theory on riemannian manifolds is only one option and may be the simplest one .",
    "but it s possible to write a gauge theory for gravity , with metric , non - metricity and torsion can be constructed easily @xcite .",
    "such theories are defined on a weitzenbck spacetime , with globally non zero torsion but with vanishing local riemannian tensor . in this theory , which is called teleparallel gravity",
    ", people are working on a non - riemannian spacetime manifold .",
    "the dynamics of the metric is defined uniquely by the torsion @xmath4 .",
    "the basic quantities in teleparallel or the natural extension of it , namely @xmath0 gravity , is the vierbein ( tetrad ) basis @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this basis of vectors is unique and orthonormal and is defined by the following equation @xmath11 this tetrade basis must be orthonormal and @xmath12 is the flat minkowski metric , @xmath13 .",
    "one suitable form of the action for @xmath0 gravity in weitzenbck spacetime is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of torsion @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamical quantity of the model is the scalar torsion @xmath4 and the matter lagrangian @xmath16 .",
    "the equation of motion derived from the action , by varying with respect to the @xmath10 , is given by @xmath17 as usual @xmath18 is the energy - momentum tensor for matter sector of the lagrangian @xmath16 .",
    "it is a straightforward calculation to show that this equation of motion is reduced to einstein gravity when @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , this is the equivalence between the teleparallel theory and the einstein gravity .",
    "we take a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ] we add in the action ( [ a-1 ] ) a scalar field with an unknown potential function @xmath21 ( sometimes also known as saez - ballester model @xcite ) .",
    "however a slight redefinition of ( @xmath22 where @xmath23 correspond to non - phantom / phantom phase , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "the total action reads : @xmath24 here trace of the torsion tensor is @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the lagrange multiplier and @xmath28 is the hubble parameter . for our convenience ,",
    "we keep the original saez - ballester scalar field in our effective action . varying ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath4 , we obtain @xmath29 here prime denotes the derivative with respect @xmath4 . by substituting ( [ landa ] ) in ( [ action ] ) , and integrating over the spatial volume",
    "we get the following reduced lagrangian : @xmath30\\big(t+6(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^2\\big)+v(\\phi)\\dot{\\phi}^2-w(\\phi)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) , the equations of motion read as follows @xmath31 @xmath32,\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath33 equation ( [ 6 ] ) indicates two possibilities : ( 1 ) @xmath34 , which gives the teleparallel gravity and we are not interested in this case .",
    "( 2 ) another possibility is @xmath35 which is the standard definition of the torsion scalar in @xmath0 gravity . in the next section",
    "we will investigate the noether gauge symmetries of the newly proposed model in ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "to calculate the noether symmetries , we define it first . a vector field @xcite @xmath36 is a noether gauge symmetry corresponding to a lagrangian @xmath37",

    "we have : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants .",
    "it is interesting to note that quadratic @xmath55 has been used to model static wormholes in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "also the scalar potential is proportional to @xmath56 which has been previously reported in @xcite for @xmath5-tachyon model .",
    "recently iorio & saridakis @xcite studied solar system constraints on the model ( [ sol1 ] ) and found the bound @xmath57 further a @xmath58 term can cure all the four types of the finite - time future singularities in @xmath0 gravity , similar to that in @xmath59 gravity @xcite .",
    "the quadratic correction to teleparallel model is quite vital as a next approximation in astrophysical context .",
    "hence the noether gauge symmetry approach generates a cosmologically viable model of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "it is clear from ( [ sol1])-([sol2 ] ) that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) admits two noether symmetry generators @xmath60 the first symmetry @xmath61 ( invariance under time translation ) gives the energy conservation of the dynamical system in the form of ( [ inter1 ] ) below , while the second symmetry @xmath62 ( scaling symmetry ) and a corresponding conserved quantity of the form ( [ inter2 ] ) below .",
    "the two first integrals ( conserved quantities ) which are @xmath63 also the commutator of generators satisfies @xmath64=\\mathbf{x}_1 $ ] which shows that the algebra of generators is closed .",
    "we rewrite eq . ( [ lag ] ) using the solutions for @xmath0 , @xmath8 , @xmath47 as obtained in the previous section in the following form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we choose @xmath67 for simplification and further we take @xmath68 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations read @xmath69 @xmath70 their evolutionary behavior is obtained by numerically solving the euler - lagrange equations ( [ a])-([phi ] ) for an appropriate set of the parameters and the initial conditions .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     to obtain the equation of state parameter numerically , first we note that for @xmath0-saez - ballester theory , the energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath71-g_{\\mu\\nu}w(\\phi).\\ ] ] it is easy to calculate the total energy density and averaged pressure @xmath72 the eos parameter is constructed via @xmath73 putting the potential functions ( [ v ] ) and ( [ w ] ) in ( [ w ] ) , we get @xmath74 the numerical simulation of @xmath75 is drawn in the figure which shows that @xmath76 behaves like the phantom energy for a brief period of time .",
    "this conclusion is exciting since there exists convincing astrophysical evidence that the observable universe is currently in the phantom phase @xcite .",
    "in this paper , motivated by some earlier works on noether symmetry in @xmath0 gravity , we introduced a new model containing a canonical scalar field with a potential .",
    "firstly we showed that this model obeys a quadratic term of torsion , with potential proportional to @xmath56 which also appears for tachyonic field in @xmath5 model .",
    "it is also interesting to note that quadratic @xmath55 has been used to model static wormholes in @xmath0 gravity in literature .      *",
    "our numerical simulations show that there happens a phantom crossing scenario for a brief period in this toy model , after which the state parameter evolves to cosmological constant asymptotically .",
    "* the behavior of hubble parameter in our model closely mimics to that of @xmath3cdm model , thus our model is an alternative to the later . * since at the same time @xmath3cdm model can not explain the phantom crossing as is observed from the empirical astrophysical results , one should prefer alternatives to @xmath3cdm model such as the present one .",
    "it is curious to note that such a result is obtained from a lorentz invariance violating @xmath0 theory , however , the same theory is consistent with solar system tests , contains attractor solutions , and is free of massive gravitons . *",
    "the results reported here are significantly different from @xcite since there we calculated the ` noether symmetries ' while here only ` noether gauge symmetries ' are obtained",
    ". as one can see , the results obtained here are different from the ones previously obtained in the literature . *",
    "the most important feature of @xmath0 gravity which differs it from any other `` curvature invariant '' model like @xmath5 theory , is its irreducibility to a scalar model in the jordan frame unlike @xmath5 .",
    "as we know , @xmath5 gravity can be reduced to a scalar field by a simple identification between the scalar field and the gravity sector of the action in the jordan frame . but here , since the lorentz symmetry is broken locally , and also for leakage of finding such formal transformation between the scalar field and the torsion action , these two models are not equivalent .",
    "so unless the @xmath5 , here proposition of the scalar field is not artificial and do not add any additional degree of freedom to the model . from another point of the view , the @xmath0 gravity is not conformal invariant , so reduction of the gravity sector to the scalar matter is not possible .",
    "so indeed by introducing the scalar field in the action , we avoided from a similar formal extensions like two scalar components models , like quintessence .",
    "note that proposition of the scalar field to @xmath0 is completely new irreducible action but to @xmath5 is just the quintom model or in it s extreme form reduces to the multi - scalar models with less symmetry than the original action .        99 a.g .",
