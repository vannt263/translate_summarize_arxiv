    "given knots @xmath3 and @xmath4 in homology 3-spheres @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , the spliced sum of @xmath5 and @xmath7 along @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the homology 3-sphere obtained by gluing the two knot complements along their boundaries matching the meridian of one knot to the longitude of the other .",
    "this operation is a generalization of connected sum ; indeed when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are trivial knots , the spliced sum of @xmath5 and @xmath7 along @xmath3 and @xmath4 is none other than the connected sum @xmath8 casson s invariant @xmath9 , which is additive under connected sum , is also additive under the more general operation of spliced sum , for a proof , see @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable about this is that the casson invariant of a spliced sum does not depend on the knots @xmath3 and @xmath4 along which the splicing is performed .",
    "while the integer - valued @xmath0 casson invariant @xmath10 of @xcite is not additive under connected sum , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) , the difference @xmath11 is , and a natural question to ask is whether it is also additive under spliced sum . in general , the answer is no and we briefly explain why not . recall from @xcite that a seifert - fibered homology sphere @xmath12 can be described as a spliced sum of brieskorn spheres along the cores of their singular fibers in three different ways : ( i ) the spliced sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; ( ii ) the spliced sum of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; and ( iii ) the spliced sum of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "additivity under splicing would imply that the evaluation of @xmath11 on all three of these pairs of brieskorn spheres agree , but the results in @xcite provide examples where they do not .",
    "this shows that @xmath11 is not additive under spliced sum .",
    "thus , it is an interesting problem to understand the behaviour of the @xmath0 casson invariant under spliced sum , and in this paper we focus on the simplest possible case , namely when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are torus knots .",
    "we verify a conjecture of @xcite by identifying the @xmath0 casson invariant of the spliced sum with a multiple of the product of the casson @xmath1 knot invariants in the case @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath19 and @xmath20 torus knots .",
    "our results combine a detailed analysis of the @xmath0 representation varieties of the knot complements with computations of the @xmath21 spectral flow of the odd signature operator coupled to a path of @xmath0 connections .",
    "an essential tool developed here is the general splitting formula of theorem [ thm2.10 ] , which is applied to compute the spectral flow for closed 3-manifolds split along a torus .",
    "we now outline the argument and highlight the special role played by the splitting formula . as",
    "before , we assume @xmath3 and @xmath4 are knots in homology spheres @xmath5 and @xmath7 and we denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 their complements and by @xmath24 their spliced sum . a representation @xmath25 determines , by restriction ,",
    "representations @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the results of @xcite show that for torus knots the conjugacy class @xmath28 $ ] contributes to the @xmath0 casson invariant of @xmath29 only when @xmath30 is irreducible and both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are reducible . by conjugating",
    ", we can arrange that @xmath31 is an @xmath33 representation and that @xmath32 is an @xmath34 representation . in order to compute @xmath35",
    "we must enumerate all such representations and compute the @xmath21 spectral flow from the trivial connection @xmath36 to the flat connection @xmath37 on @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "since the @xmath33 representation varieties of torus knots are connected , there is a path @xmath38 of flat @xmath33 connections on @xmath22 connecting @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and likewise a path @xmath41 of flat @xmath42 connections on @xmath23 connecting @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , these paths can be chosen to satisfy the hypotheses in theorem [ thm2.10 ] .",
    "the splitting theorem then describes the spectral flow on the spliced sum @xmath29 as a sum of the spectral flows of the paths @xmath38 and @xmath41 of _ flat _ connections on knot complements @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the spectral flow of a closed path of @xmath0 connections on the solid torus , and some finite dimensional maslov triple indices .",
    "each of these terms can be computed by direct analysis , and from this we deduce our main application , theorem [ mainresult ] , which identifies the @xmath0 casson invariant of the spliced sum with four times the product of the @xmath1 casson knot invariants in the case @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath19 and @xmath20 torus knots .",
    "here is a brief synopsis of the rest of the paper . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the splitting theorem in the general setting .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains some general results about @xmath0 representations of spliced sums , and sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] give descriptions of the reducible and irreducible @xmath0 representations of torus knots .",
    "section [ sec6 ] contains cohomology calculations , and section [ sec7 ] presents the main application to computing the @xmath0 casson invariant for spliced sums along torus knots .",

    "the @xmath0 casson invariant for homology 3-spheres is defined in @xcite by counting counting gauge orbits of irreducible ( perturbed ) flat @xmath0 connections with sign given by the @xmath21 spectral flow . in the case of a 3-manifold split along a surface ,",
    "a useful tool for performing computations of the spectral flow is provided by splitting the spectral flow along the manifold decomposition . unfortunately",
    ", previous splitting formulas treat mainly the @xmath1 case and do not readily apply to the present situation .",
    "therefore , we will develop a suitably general splitting formula for 3-manifolds split along a torus .",
    "since the space of connections is contractible , the spectral flow on a closed manifold only depends on the endpoints , hence we will write @xmath45 for any path @xmath46 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . when working on manifolds with boundary , it is essential to have a family or at least a path of `` nice '' boundary conditions associated to the restriction of @xmath46 to the boundary ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , given a path of certain atiyah - patodi - singer boundary conditions , we could derive a splitting formula for arbitrary splitting surfaces . in the case of a torus",
