    "the cause of this acceleration still remains an open and tantalizing question .",
    "historically , physics has addressed such imbalances by either identifying sources that were previously unaccounted for , or by altering the governing equations .",

    "the physical motivations for these modifications of gravity were related to the possibility of a more realistic representation of the gravitational fields near curvature singularities and to create some first order approximation for the quantum theory of gravitational fields .    in this context , a more general modification of the einstein - hilbert gravitational lagrangian density involving an arbitrary function of the scalar invariant , @xmath7 , was considered in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite . recently ,",

    "<S> wormhole geometries in curvature - matter coupled modified gravity are explored , by considering an explicit nonminimal coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature , @xmath0 , and the lagrangian density of matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is the effective stress - energy tensor containing the coupling between matter and the higher order curvature derivatives that is responsible for the null energy condition violation , and consequently for supporting the respective wormhole geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the general restrictions imposed by the null energy condition violation are presented in the presence of a nonminimal @xmath1matter coupling . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , obtaining exact solutions to the gravitational field equations is extremely difficult due to the nonlinearity of the equations , although the problem is mathematically well - defined . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we outline several approaches for finding wormhole solutions , and deduce an exact solution by considering a linear @xmath0 nonmiminal curvature - matter coupling and by considering an explicit monotonically decreasing function for the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> although it is difficult to find exact solutions of matter threading the wormhole satisfying the energy conditions at the throat , an exact solution is found where the nonminimal coupling does indeed minimize the violation of the null energy condition of normal matter at the throat . </S>"
