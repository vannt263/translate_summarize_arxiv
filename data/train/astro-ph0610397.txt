    "@xmath9 could be excluded or confirmed requires a ten - fold larger sample , i.e. o(1000 ) sne at @xmath12 where @xmath10 is best measured in order to improve not only on statistics , but also on systematics .",
    "several second - generation surveys have been designed to build such samples : the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , and the essence project at the cerro - tololo interamerican observatory .",

    "currently broadband photometric measurements are calibrated using observations of reference standard stars , which define a photometric system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most photometric systems are ultimately tied to the sed of vega . however , since vega is @xmath24 times brighter than the mag 15 secondary standards currently used by large telescopes , the path from the vega sed determination to the zero points of modern standard star catalogs is rather indirect .",
    "this can lead to systematic errors of a few percent when trying to convert magnitudes into fluxes @xcite .    in supernova cosmology",
    ", we study the luminosity - distance - versus - redshift - relation , @xmath25 . in order to measure the luminosity distance of a supernova",

    "the zero points of the photometric system used to calibrate our measurements , in order to convert calibrated magnitudes into fluxes .",
    "depending on how the magnitude system was tied to the sed of the fundamental flux standard ( such as vega ) , this step can be one of the dominant sources of systematic errors on the cosmological measurements .",

    "most well studied nearby sne  ia were discovered by @xcite and others during the last decade , and calibrated in the photometric system defined by @xcite .",
    "we therefore have to adopt the same calibration source for the snls sample .",
    "this avoids introducing additional systematic uncertainties between the distant and nearby sn fluxes .",
    "however , this is complicated by the fact that the megacam passbands differ significantly from the @xmath27 filters used by landolt .",
    "megacam is a wide - field imager , built by the commissariat  lnergie atomique ( cea ) for the prime focus of the 3.6-m canada france hawaii telescope .",
    "it covers a field area of @xmath28 deg@xmath3 , with an excellent and remarkably uniform image quality .",

    "great care has been taken in the internal calibration of the imager .",
    "indeed , any not accounted - for shutter imperfection or non - linearity of the detector / electronics can bias the measurements and hence the cosmology .",
    "another potential source of problems is the uniformity of the camera : we can not afford to calibrate each of the 36 ccds using standard star observations .",
    "most standard stars are therefore observed with the center ccds , and the camera non - uniformities of the photometric response are carefully modeled .",
    "any residual radial non - uniformities of the photometric response may distort the supernova luminosity distribution , and bias the cosmological measurements . in this section ,",

    "the design of the shutter is based on the controlled rotation of a half disk ,  one meter in diameter  in order to ensure a constant speed when the shutter crosses the ccd mosaic .",
    "the exact duration of the exposure time is measured with a precision of 0.5 ms with a dedicated system independent from the shutter motion controller .",
    "the shutter precision was investigated by the cfht team .",
    "it was shown that the non - uniformity due to the shutter is below 0.3% accross the mosaic .",

    "the filters currently mounted on megacam are interferometric filters manufactured by reosc / sagem .",
    "their transmissions were characterized by the manufacturer and the cfht team .",
    "small systematic differences were found between the megacam and sdss filters , which translate into small color terms between both instruments ( see below ) .",
    "at the end of each cfht run , the raw images are processed using the elixir pipeline , developed by the cfht team @xcite .",
    "master flat field images and fringe corrections are built from all the data taken during the run , including pi data .",
    "the elixir pipeline applies these flat fields to the data , subtract the fringe patterns and determines an astrometric solution .",
    "flat - fielding ensures that the pixel - to - pixel response is uniform accross the entire focal plane .",
    "however , it was found that the photometric response measured on flat - fielded images was not uniform . in other words ,",
    "two measurements of the same star , at two different locations of the focal plane , may yield different instrumental fluxes .",
    "these non - uniformities have been measured using dithered observations of dense stellar fields , and have been found to be radial and as large as 15% ( fig .  [",

    "these observed non - uniformities may have a number of explanations , and a combination of explanations is likely .",

    "the elixir team has deliberately chosen to provide reduced data which has a uniform photometric response across the mosaic , at the expense of a non - uniform sky background .    in order to improve",
    "significantly the measurements published in @xcite , snls has started an ambitious program to decrease the internal calibration uncertainties down to 1% .",
    "a considerable amount of work is therefore still being carried out on this subject by the elixir and snls teams . in particular",
    ", the dense stellar field dithers are being reanalyzed by both teams using different methods , in order to improve the photometric correction function , and to investigate potential non - uniformities in the filter passbands .",
    "the images preprocessed by the elixir pipeline have a flat photometric response .",
    "each image has then to be aligned on the landolt catalog .",
    "we have chosen to proceed in two steps : first , we have built a catalog of so called tertiary standards , i.e. science field stars whose fluxes have been calibrated using landolt star observations .",
    "then , using this catalog , each image containing tertiary standards can be calibrated .",
    "building a tertiary standard catalog is relatively easy since we have between 12 and 25 epochs ( depending on the passband : 12 in @xmath37 and @xmath35 and over 20 in @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) for each science field , and since both standard and science fields were repeatedly observed .",
    "photometric nights were selected using the cfht `` skyprobe '' instrument @xcite , which monitors atmospheric transparency in the direction that the telescope is pointing .",
    "only the 50% of nights with the smallest scatter in transparency were considered . for each night , stars were selected in the science fields and their aperture fluxes measured and corrected to an airmass of 1 using the average atmospheric extinction of mauna kea .",
    "these aperture fluxes were then averaged , allowing for photometric ratios between exposures of the same night .",
    "stable observing conditions were indicated by a very small scatter in these photometric ratios ( typically 0.2% ) ; again the averaging was robust , with 5-@xmath40 deviations rejected .",
    "observations of the landolt standard star fields were processed in the same manner , though their fluxes were not averaged .",
    "the apertures were chosen sufficiently large ( about 6  in diameter ) to bring the variations of aperture corrections across the mosaic below 0.005 mag .",
    "however , since fluxes are measured in the same way and in the same apertures in science images and standard star fields , we did not apply any aperture correction .    using standard star observations , we first determined zero - points by fitting linear color transformations and zero - points to each night and filter , however with color slopes common to all nights . in order to account for possible non - linearities in the landolt to megacam color relations , the observed color - color relations",
    "were then compared to synthetic ones derived from spectrophotometric standards .",
    "this led to shifts of roughly 0.01 in all bands other than @xmath37 , for which the shift was 0.03 due to the nontrivial relation to @xmath6 and @xmath41 .",
    "we then applied the zero - points appropriate for each night to the catalog of science field stars of that same night .",
    "these magnitudes were averaged robustly , rejecting 5-@xmath40 outliers , and the average standard star observations were merged .",
    "figure  [ figure : calibration_residuals ] shows the dispersion of the calibration residuals in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath35 bands . the observed standard deviation , which sets the upper bound to the repeatability of the photometric measurements , is about or below 0.01  mag in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and about 0.016  mag in @xmath35 .    , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath35 , for all ccds and fields , with one entry per star and epoch .",
    "the dispersion is below 1% in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and about 1.5% in @xmath35 .",
    "[ figure : calibration_residuals ] ]    for each of the four snls fields , a catalog of tertiary standards was produced using the procedure described above .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the photometric scale of these catalogs comes from the determination of the color - color relations of the standard star measurements . for the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands , a zero - point offset of 0.01 mag",
    "would easily be detected ; hence we took this value as a conservative uncertainty estimate .",
    "the @xmath35 band is affected by a larger measurement noise , and it is calibrated with respect to @xmath42 and @xmath43 landolt measurements .",
    "we therefore attributed to it a larger zero point uncertainty of 0.03 mag .    once magnitudes are assigned to tertiairy standards ,",
    "supernova magnitudes are measured by estimating the supernova flux and the field stars ( i.e. the tertiary standard ) fluxes with the same psf photometry .",
    "although supernovae involve a differential photometry and field stars do not , we were able to prove that the possible biases of the supernova to field stars flux ratios are negligible ( see * ? ? ? * )    [ [ megacam - filter - model ] ] _ megacam filter model _ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for the megacam filters , we used the measurements provided by the manufacturer , multiplied by the ccd quantum efficiency , the megaprime wide - field corrector transmission function , the cfht primary mirror reflectivity , and the average atmospheric transmission at mauna kea .",
    "as an additional check , we computed synthetic megacam - sdss color terms using the synthetic transmissions of the sdss 2.5-m telescope @xcite and spectrophotometric standards taken from @xcite . since the sdss science catalog @xcite shares thousands of objects with two of the four fields repeatedly observed with megacam , we were able to compare these synthetic color transformations with the observed transformations .",
    "we found a good agreement , with uncertainties at the 1% level .",
    "this constrains the central wavelengths of the megacam band passes to within 10 to 15    with respect to the sdss 2.5 m band passes .",

    "the choice of filter band passes to use for landolt based observations is not unique .",
    "most previous supernova cosmology works assumed that the determinations of @xcite describe the effective landolt system well , although the author himself questions this fact , explicitly warning that the landolt system _ `` is not a good match to the standard system '' _  _ i.e. _ the historical johnsons - cousins system .",
    "fortunately , @xcite provide spectrophotometric measurements of a few objects measured in @xcite ; this enabled us to compare synthetic magnitudes computed using bessell transmissions with landolt measurements of the same objects .",
    "this comparison reveals small residual color terms which vanish if the @xmath6 , @xmath41 , @xmath44 and @xmath42 bessell filters are blue - shifted by 41 , 27 , 21 and 25    respectively .",
    "furthermore , if one were to assume that the bessell filters describe the landolt system , this would lead to synthetic megacam - landolt color terms significantly different from the measured ones ; the blue shifts determined above bring them into excellent agreement .",
    "we therefore assumed that the landolt catalog magnitudes refer to blue - shifted bessell filters , with a typical central wavelength uncertainty of 10 to 15   , corresponding roughly to a 0.01 accuracy for the color terms .    a powerful check of ( 1 )",
    "our alignement on the landolt system ( 2 ) our model of the megacam passbands and ( 3 ) our model of the effective landolt filters is to compare observed and synthetic color - color plots , using our observations of the landolt stars and synthetic landolt and megacam magnitudes of stellar spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : color_color_plots ] presents the @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 diagram built from ( 1 ) megacam observations of landolt stars ( blue dots ) ( 2 ) synthetic @xmath47-band magnitudes computed using our passband models and spectra taken from @xcite ( red dots ) and @xcite ( black dots ) .",

    "[ fig : color_color_plots ] ]",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : generalities ] , the current calibration program is not optimal for supernova cosmology : we know little about the systematic uncertainties associated with converting landolt magnitudes into fluxes , and there is no official determination of the landolt passbands . finally , the @xmath35-band is redder than the reddest landolt band ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , the megacam to landolt @xmath16 to @xmath42 transformation is an extrapolation , based on the sampling of the main sequence stars published by @xcite .",
    "the calibration landscape is rapidly evolving , and quickly getting much richer and redundant .",
    "the set of hst flux standards , aligned on the white dwarf flux scale @xcite is constantly expanding , and includes fundamental calibrators such as vega @xcite and bd + 17 4708 ( ab fundamental standard ) @xcite .",

    "this effort consist in observing in all bands a dithered sequence of the snls fields , parts of the well calibrated sdss southern strip , landolt calibrators and hst fundamental standards .",
    "the dither sequence will allow us to check the uniformity of the photometric response , and detect possible variations of the amplifier gains at the sub - percent level .",
    "the combination of celestial calibrators will permit to calibrate the tertiary standards against several important magnitude systems , and to check for systematic differences between those systems .",
    "the calibration of the snls dataset is challenging in several aspects .",
    "first , megacam is a wide field imager , and controlling the uniformity of such an instrument is not possible without a dedicated calibration program .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : calibration_procedure ] that not accounted - for non - uniformities can bias the cosmological measurements .",
    "another difficult task is to control how the landolt system is tied to vega , its fundamental flux standard .",
    "we have therefore embarked in two distinct programs to ( 1 ) control the internal calibration of our imager with a precision better than 1% and ( 2 ) check our current calibration path .",
    "a longer term goal is to define an absolute flux calibration of the snls survey , based on the white dwarf flux scale .",
    "the photometric calibration work currently carried out will allow us to reach the 1% precision which must be attained to significantly improve the measurements of the cosmological parameters .",

    "<S> finally , the sn  ia sed differs significantly from that of stars and transfering the stellar calibration to the snls data requires a precise knowledge of the sn  ia spectra and the instrument transmissions .    </S>",
    "<S> we present and discuss the snls calibration strategy used to analyze the first year data set . </S>",
    "<S> we present the calibration aspects which impact most the cosmological measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the intercalibration of the snls with other surveys , such as the cfhtls - wide and the sdss . </S>"
