    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) has been attracted much attention because of its potential application to new electronic devices.@xcite the experimental observations on high quality suspended blg samples @xcite show that the ground state of the electrons at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) is insulating with puzzling properties in the presence of external magnetic field : ( i ) the insulating gap can be closed by a perpendicular electric field of either polarity,@xcite ( ii ) the gap grows greatly with increasing magnetic field @xmath0 about 46 times larger than the zeeman splitting at @xmath1 tesla,@xcite ( iii ) the state is particle - hole asymmetric in the presence of the magnetic field,@xcite ( iv ) there is a peak structure in the electric conductivity at small @xmath0 and at the cnp,@xcite and ( v ) there are quantum hall states at all integers from 0 to @xmath2.@xcite on theoretical aspect , a number of models for the ground state of the electrons in blg have been proposed , which include the ferroelectric - layer asymmetric state @xcite or quantum valley hall state,@xcite a layer - polarized antiferromagnetic state,@xcite a quantum anomalous hall state,@xcite a quantum spin hall state,@xcite a superconducting state in coexistence with antiferromagnetism,@xcite an ordered - current state,@xcite , and a spin - polarized current state ( spcs).@xcite besides these , the insulating gap has also been explained as electron scattering on boundaries between domains with different stacking ( ab and ba).@xcite the earlier studies based on the renormalization group approach predicted the lifshitz transition in the interacting electron system of blg.@xcite amongst these models , only the spcs can qualitatively explain the above experimental observations .    by the spcs model,@xcite",
    "there are spin - dependent currents between the lattice sites due to the interactions between electrons . in our previous work ,",
    "only the intra - sublattice current orders were taken into account .",
    "one then raises a question : are there any possible inter - sublattice current orderings ? in this work , we will answer this question by deriving and solving an eight - band model that counts in all the possible current orderings of interacting electrons in the blg .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electrons is @xmath3 where @xmath4 creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath5 at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the hopping energy between sites @xmath6 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number deviation of electrons at site @xmath6 from the average occupation @xmath10 , and @xmath11 s are the interactions between electrons .",
    "we use the tight - binding model considering only the intra - layer nn [ between @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) ] and interlayer nn ( between @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) electron hoppings given by @xmath16 = 3 ev and @xmath17 = 0.273 ev , respectively.@xcite we will use the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and therefore adopt effective interactions that include screening due to the electronic charge fluctuations . as in our previous model,@xcite",
    "the effective interactions are given as @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 as a vector from site @xmath6 to site @xmath8 , and @xmath21 is the screening constant with @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 ) the polarizability by the random - phase - approximation ( rpa).@xcite the form of @xmath24 is consistent with the rpa in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "in our previous work,@xcite we have shown that except the intra - sublattice current ordering there are no charge and spin orderings with absence of the magnetic field .",
    "we here confine ourselves to the case of no external magnetic field and at the cnp .",
    "we therefore ignore the on - site interaction and simplify the discussion only on the current orderings .",
    "first , we explain why the current orderings may appear in the system . by the mfa , the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ hm ] ) is approximated as @xmath26 in general , the average @xmath27 is not always real , but may contain an imaginary part,@xcite @xmath28 the imaginary part @xmath29 here corresponds to a current , which is self - consistently determined by the mfa .",
    "the treatment of the current between the sites of same sublattice has been detailed in ref . .",
    "in addition to the intra - sublattice currents , we here consider the inter - sublattice currents between the sites in the same layer as well as in different layers .",
    "first , we analyze the currents between the two sublattices @xmath12 and @xmath14 , for example , on the top layer shown in fig .",
    "the consideration applies to the currents between other sublattices . in fig . 1 , we draw all the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) bond currents between the @xmath12 ( black ) and @xmath14 ( white ) atoms .",
    "the purple lines denote the current from atom @xmath14 to atom @xmath12 , the red and green lines are respectively the left - turn and right - turn currents from @xmath12 to @xmath14 .",
    "the hexagons consisting of green and purple bonds contain the right - turn current loops , while the hexagons of red and purple bonds bear the left - turn current loops .",
    "the current in the purple bond equals to the sum of the currents in the red and green bonds because of the current continuity . in this process ,",
    "the current density at each atom does not vanish , which is different from the case of the currents between the same sublattice where the current density vanishes .",
    "since currents are in loop forms , the total current is zero .    from fig . 1",
    ", we see that the translational invariance of the system is broken .",
    "one then needs a superlattice with unit cell containing more @xmath12 and @xmath14 atoms to describe the electrons .",
    "we find that there are three @xmath12 atoms and three @xmath14 atoms in the unit cell as enclosed by the dashed lines in fig . 1 for a single layer . in fig .",
    "2 , we depict the unit cell for the blg consisting of three @xmath12 atoms @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and three @xmath14 atoms @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the top layer and three @xmath13 atoms @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and three @xmath15 atoms @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 on the bottom layer . from the top view ,",
    "the @xmath14 atoms are just on top of the @xmath13 atoms , while the @xmath12 atoms are at the hexagon center of the bottom atoms .",
    "the lattice constant defined as the distance between the nn same atoms ( for example @xmath12 atoms ) is @xmath42    and interlayer distance @xmath43  .",
    "we will use the unit @xmath12 = 1 for the length .",
    "we take the basis of the unit cell as @xmath44 where the numbers in the parenthesis are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 coordinates .",
    "the area of the unit cell is @xmath47 .",
    "the basis of brillouin zone ( bz ) in the reciprocal space are given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a unit vector perpendicularly pointing out of the plane .",
    "the reciprocal lattice points @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 integers and the first bz are shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that the dirac points at the corners of the original first bz as shown in fig .",
    "3 are now the lattice points of the reciprocal space",
    ". therefore , the zero energy of noninteracting electrons now appears at the origin since the energy is a periodic function of momentum in the reciprocal space of the superlattice .",
    "we will still use the term , sublattice , to distinguish the atoms in the original blg lattice .",
    "so , there are four sublattices @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 .",
    "however , for the superlattice , there are 12 atoms in each unit cell .",
    "the term ` subspace ' will be used for describing a space consisting of one kind of these 12 atoms ; there are 12 subspaces in the system .      for description of the problem in momentum space",
    ", we first define the operator in real space @xmath53 with @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) creates an electron of spin @xmath5 at @xmath57th atom @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) in @xmath8th unit cell .",
    "then , the operator in momentum space is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is total number of the unit cells in the superlattice , and the momentum @xmath60 is confined within the first bz enclosed by the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 . for the sake of description ,",
    "we name an @xmath57th atom of sublattice @xmath61 in unit cell of the superlattice as the @xmath62 atom .",
    "for example , @xmath63 creates an electron of momentum @xmath60 and spin @xmath5 at @xmath31 atom .    in the momentum - space representation ,",
    "we obtain the expression for the non - interacting hamiltonian as @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the pauli matrix , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the momentum components along @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . by the mfa for the interactions ,",
    "the element of the self - energy is obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of momentum @xmath60 and spin @xmath5 at @xmath62 subspace , and @xmath75 is the lattice fourier component of the interaction , @xmath76 with @xmath77 the vector from the @xmath78 atom to the @xmath62 atom in the unit cell and the @xmath79-summation running over the positions of the unit cells in the superlattice .",
    "the element of the effective hamiltonian is @xmath80 .",
    "since there are 12 atoms in the unit cell of the superlattice , we thus have a 12-band model for the electrons .",
    "for the carrier concentration close to the cnp , only the energy levels close to zero momentum need to be considered .",
    "we here consider the system at the cnp . in our previous work ,",
    "the elements of the self - energy at @xmath81 have been proved to be pure imaginary numbers that come from the current orderings for the system at the cnp .",
    "we therefore have @xmath82 where the second line comes from the fact that the average @xmath83 is sizable only when @xmath84 is close to 0 .",
    "to understand the physics of such an element of the self - energy , we consider the current @xmath85   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k}{\\rm im}\\langle c^{\\dagger}_{kl'\\nu\\sigma}c_{kl\\mu\\sigma}\\rangle     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the same approximation as in eq .",
    "( [ se1 ] ) again has been used in the last line for not too large @xmath86 .",
    "but the equality in the last line is valid for the @xmath62- and @xmath78 atoms belonging to the same unit cell .",
    "therefore , the self - energy can be expressed as @xmath87 note that @xmath88 .",
    "the remaining 6@xmath8911 current elements are not independent quantities , but satisfy the current continuity law and the blg lattice symmetry .",
    "we analyze the current orders below .",
    "\\(1 ) currents between the atoms in the same sublattice . for this case",
    ", we have obtained the result in our previous works,@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a dirac point , and @xmath92 is a constant satisfying @xmath93 and @xmath94 . since @xmath95 is a lattice point in the reciprocal space , the current @xmath96 is a periodic function in the superlattice .",
    "it means that the current @xmath96 is the same when changing the position of the @xmath57th atom to another unit cell but with @xmath97th atom fixed .",
    "therefore , the formula given by eq .",
    "( [ iaa ] ) represents not only the currents between the same type atoms within the unit cell but also between that in different cells .",
    "figure 4 shows the currents flow through an atom from / to the same type atoms on a layer .",
    "the current density in this case is zero at every atom .",
    "all the bond currents between the same type atoms constitute current loops in the lattice .",
    "instead of considering @xmath92 , we define the order parameter @xmath98 we then have @xmath99 the relationship given by eq .",

    "to numerically solve the model , we first need to determine the seven interactions @xmath121 in the above equations for the order parameters . by considering the symmetry of the lattice , only three different values for the interactions",
    "are in question : @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 . in appendix b , we present the formula for these interactions in terms of sums over the original lattice points and show the relation between @xmath189 and the interaction parameter in our previous work.@xcite . in unit of @xmath190 , the three interactions are determined as @xmath189 = 4.25 , @xmath191 = 4.77 , and @xmath192 = 2.94 . with @xmath189 = 4.25 ( so @xmath193 = 6.37 as given in previous work@xcite ) , we get @xmath194 1 mev @xmath195 ( that is the experimental data@xcite ) by setting all the inter - sublattice current orderings to zero .",
    "we have solved the model at various relative strengths @xmath196 and @xmath197 and at zero temperature . to a wide range of the relative strengths @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we find that the orderings @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 vanish .",
    "the interlayer current ordering @xmath200 appears when the interaction @xmath192 is strong enough .",

    "the critical interaction strength for the current orderings between the @xmath12 and @xmath15 sublattices is about 2 times stronger than the physical interaction strength .",
    "we have thus confirmed that within the range of physical interaction strength only the intra - sublattice current orderings are possible .",
