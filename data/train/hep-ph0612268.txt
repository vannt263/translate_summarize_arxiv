    "by using direct perturbation theory ( ie . strict power series of some coupling constant ) to calculate finite temperature or nonequilibrium correlation functions , one very frequently encounters infrared ( ir ) sensitive contributions , ie .",
    "contributions that become very large ( occasionally infinite ) when we approach a certain energy scale . these contributions ,",
    "if they show up consequently in every higher loop level , render the direct perturbation theory non - convergent",
    ". then we have to collect the problematic diagrams and sum them up , before the actual perturbative procedure begins . since these diagrams are usually also ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent besides their ir sensitivity",
    ", the resummation of these diagrams must be accompanied by a proper renormalization .    in the literature",
    "there are several approaches to the renormalization of resummed perturbative series .",
    "one of them treats the resummation in the original sense , as sum of diagrams belonging to a certain subset of all feynman diagrams .",
    "one possibility is to apply bphz renormalization : then , without the reference to the lagrangian we can assign a finite ( renormalized ) value to every feynman diagram @xcite , and we define the renormalized value of the sum of diagrams as sum of their bphz renormalized value . in principle",
    "this method can be applied to all kind of resummations , but technically it can be rather involved .",
    "the difficulty is to be able to work out the bphz forest for an arbitrary diagram in the relevant subset .",
    "this task was performed for the 2pi resummation in various models in @xcite-@xcite by solving a set of bethe - salpeter equations for the four point functions .",
    "diagrammatic analysis can be used also to work out counterterms : such a technique was applied in @xcite to renormalize the 2ppi resummation .",
    "diagram by diagram renormalization can be applied for large n bubble resummation @xcite , too .",
    "another approach is based on the idea that we can try to modify the generating equation of the resummation in order to obtain finite results .",
    "it is not guaranteed to work , since the equation that we use is , in general , not exact , and so we may miss some terms important for uv finiteness . in the schwinger - dyson resummation it seems to be an important obstacle , cf .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , for hartee - fock resummation , such improvement exists , cf . @xcite . in the o(n ) model the resummation is governed by the @xmath1 order of the diagram . here",
    "we can write up closed forms , at least in the lowest orders , and so one expects that it can be also renormalized in closed form . in @xcite",
    "the authors present renormalization of the o(n ) model up to @xmath2 order , at the physical point .",
    "a third approach uses the fact that the contribution of a diagram depends on the renormalization scheme we use",
    ". it may be possible to find a scheme where the ir sensitive part of all diagrams disappears . in this ir safe scheme",
    "there is no need for resummation , usual perturbation theory can be used to calculate physical observables .",
    "thereafter we can change the renormalization scheme to a standard one ( eg .",
    "@xmath3 ) by appropriate change of the renormalized parameters of the lagrangian ( `` renormalization group '' transformation ) . at the end of this procedure",
    "we obtain the same result in the @xmath3  and the ir safe scheme for all quantities up the order @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the order of calculation .",
    "the difference is the resummation effect : it is responsible for the difference that one scheme is ir safe while the other is not .",
    "these thoughts was exploited in @xcite to perform a renormalized momentum independent resummation as a change of renormalization scheme from an ir safe one to @xmath3 .",
    "the ir safe scheme was constructed in a way that if in a perturbative calculation we encounter ir sensitive contributions , then we choose the finite part of the counterterm to cancel this ir sensitive part .",
    "this guarantees in a natural way that the calculation is free from ir sensitive contributions . at the end of the calculation",
    "we switch back to @xmath3  scheme with renormalization scheme transformation , thus we obtain the final result in @xmath3  scheme",
    ".    this idea is motivated by the `` environmentally friendly '' renormalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the renormalization scale was used to take into account the environmental dependence .    in @xcite",
    "the first step was done towards the generalization of the method to momentum dependent resummations .",
    "it was observed , that if we do perturbation theory with a propagator , which equals to the @xmath3  propagator _ asymptotically _",
    ", then all the overall divergences  and so all the counterterms  are the same as in the @xmath3  scheme . since ir sensitiveness occurs  by definition  in the ir , we expect that it can be captured by an appropriate modification in the ir region .",
    "so if we base our perturbation theory on a propagator that is exact in the ir and @xmath3-like in the uv , we can use the @xmath3  counterterms for renormalization .",
    "a great advantage of this method is that one does not need to solve bethe - salpeter equations , which is a central task in other , diagram - based 2pi renormalizations . on the other hand",
    "it is not easy to implement the momentum independent resummation in this method .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to connect the momentum independent and momentum dependent method in a common framework .",
    "we will examine the possibility and consistency of a perturbation theory with arbitrarily chosen free lagrangian , which not necessarily approaches the usual free part ( @xmath6 ) asymptotically . therefore the generated divergences are also different from the usual case .",
    "still it can be consistent , if the usual process of the renormalization can be accomplished ",
    "the conditions for this will be examined in the paper .",
    "but once we have a consistent perturbation theory with `` any '' propagator , then nothing prohibits us to apply a scheme , where the renormalized self energy is _",
    "zero_. in this scheme the free propagator is exact  and this is exactly the effect of 2pi resummation .",
    "so we can perform renormalized 2pi resummation with help of a cleverly chosen renormalization scheme .    in this paper",
    "we accomplish this strategy for the two - loop 2pi resummation of the @xmath0 theory at finite temperature .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows . in section [ sec : pt ] we study in detail the feasibility of the renormalized perturbation theory with an arbitrary propagator , and work out the strategy for 2pi resummation . in section",
    "[ sec : phi4 ] we perform renormalized 2pi resummation in the quartic scalar model at finite temperature up to two loop level .",
    "we close the discussion with conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us start from a renormalizable lagrangian , which now means that it is renormalizable in the non - perturbative sense : we can define regularization dependent parameters in the lagrangian in a way that the exact @xmath5-point functions are all finite when we remove the regularization .",
    "we assume that we split this bare lagrangian into two pieces : a `` free '' part and an `` interaction part '' .",
    "the free part should be quadratic in the fields in order to be solvable , but there are also quadratic pieces in the interaction lagrangian ( like the mass counterterms ) . here , however , we do not fix the kernel of the quadratic part to the form appearing in the bare lagrangian : we allow arbitrary choice of the kernel .",
    "we subdivide the interaction part , as usual , assigning `` orders '' to them according to a formal loop parameter . in this way we defined a perturbation theory .",
    "the question is : when is the so - defined perturbation theory finite _",
    "order by order _ ?",
    "the counterterms should be defined as the overall divergence of the 1pi diagrams , when `` overall divergence '' means that all the momenta at all lines are going to the infinity at the same rate .",
    "when are these counterterms enough to make finite the complete contribution of all the diagrams at a given order of perturbation theory ?    for a consistent renormalization , in fact , we should ensure only two conditions @xcite .",
    "first , the divergence of an overall divergent diagram should be local : in fourier space it should be a polynomial of its external momenta .",
    "second , if we subtract all subdivergences of a diagram , the diagram should be overall divergent or finite .",
    "the proof that these conditions are satisfied in case of using the usual free propagator was done by weinberg @xcite .",
    "but the basic property of the propagator , which was in fact used by the proof , is that the free propagator can be power expanded `` around infinity '' , ie . :",
    "@xmath7 if @xmath8 ( which means that all of its components go to infinity with a fixed ratio ) .",
    "this ensures that differentiation with respect to external momenta will decrease the degree of divergence of the diagram , and so  if we differentiate enough times  the contribution will be finite .",
    "the asymptotic expansion property of eq .",
    "( [ w_reg ] ) , however , is true for a wide class of functions , not just for @xmath9 . with any of these functions",
    "the weinberg theorem goes through .",
    "then all of the consequences will hold true , too , which can be summarized in a phrase that the theory can be renormalized by local counterterms with polynomial momentum dependence .    the weinberg theorem in itself does not guarantee that we need a finite number of counterterms , only that the counterterm method works .",
    "we also need the condition that only those operators are divergent that show up in the bare lagrangian . in the four dimensional @xmath10 model , for example",
    ", we generate a logarithmic divergence for the 8-point function at one loop level , which was not included in the original lagrangian , and so it is not renormalizable .",
    "that means that we should accept only those propagators , where there are no more divergent diagrams than in the usual @xmath9 case .",
    "if we assume that the propagator is asymptotically @xmath11 , then the one - loop correction to the 6-point function in the @xmath0 model contains the integral @xmath12 .",
    "this is uv convergent if @xmath13 : so the propagator should be smaller than @xmath14 for asymptotic momenta .",
    "the exact propagator in four dimensions picks up only logarithmic corrections to the @xmath15 behavior , according to the weinberg theorem .",
    "thus it may be a good candidate to be the basic propagator of a perturbation theory .",
    "once we have fixed the kernel , and so the propagator , too , we can use it for ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , we can do finite temperature calculations .",
    "since temperature effects are exponentially suppressed in the propagator at high momenta , the overall divergence of a diagram ( when all the momenta goes in the same rate to infinity ) is _ temperature independent_. this ensures that the counterterms are temperature independent , and so a zero temperature renormalization is enough for a finite temperature calculation , too .",
    "according to the above analysis , a large class of functions is good to be used as `` free '' propagators . but which one is worth to be used ?",
    "the best choice is the one which is optimized for the problem at hand , ie . where the perturbative series converge the fastest .",
    "if we keep the bare lagrangian intact , then any choice describes the same physics , so each is a resummed version of another .",
    "this is similar when we choose the best renormalization scale . to compute the potential , for example ,",
    "the best choice is to have a scale @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distance between the point charges .",
    "then large logarithmic corrections are suppressed , perturbation series converge well . to keep the bare lagrangian intact we should tune the parameters of the perturbation theory accordingly : in particular we have to work with the @xmath18-dependent coupling @xmath19 .",
    "we will use the same strategy : we optimize the kernel for a certain problem , for example for computations at temperature @xmath20 . to keep the bare lagrangian intact",
    "we should work with @xmath20 dependent parameters in the perturbation theory ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "then we describe the same physics from different points of view .",
    "next we express this strategy in more formal terms in the @xmath0 model .",
    "first we establish the generic strategy , then we examine the relation of perturbation theories with different kernel choices to each other .",
    "the bare lagrangian of the theory reads @xmath22 in the usual procedure we first change to the renormalized field : @xmath23 , then we find @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then we split @xmath28 and @xmath29 and find @xmath30 the above form suggests a separation of the non - interacting and interacting theory as @xmath31 where we treat @xmath32 as interactions .",
    "it must be emphasized that the values of the counterterms are not fixed beforehand : they are determined order - by order , and they do depend on the choice of the chosen perturbative scheme .",
    "we can prove @xcite , however , that in the @xmath5-th order of perturbation theory the values of the counterterms are scheme independent up to @xmath33 .",
    "the above described procedure is not unique .",
    "starting from ( [ lbare1 ] ) we can separate the renormalized and counterterms as @xmath34 the kernel of the quadratic part ( shortly `` kernel '' in the followings ) used here is arbitrary , although for consistency we will require certain properties to be satisfied . to obtain the bare lagrangian ( [ lbare1 ] ) , the kernel- and the coupling - counterterms should satisfy @xmath35 the above form suggests the following free - interaction separation @xmath36 the coupling constant and kernel counterterms",
    "are considered to be of higher loop order as compared to the coupling constant and kernel , respectively .",
    "their values should be determined order by order , just like in the usual case .",
    "we should compute the diagrams , determine the infinite parts and then make them disappear by a suitable choice of the infinite part of the counterterms .",
    "the propagator should satisfy ( [ w_reg ] ) , then the divergences are polynomial in their momenta ; it also has to have appropriate asymptotics , then only those operators are divergent that are present also in the bare lagrangian . to make these divergences disappear , we should choose @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are divergent constants .",
    "since from ( [ bare_ren_relation ] ) we can write @xmath41 , so we can identify the infinite parts of @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively",
    ". it must be emphasized , that the actual form of @xmath46 and @xmath47 depends on the choice of the kernel .",
    "the logics of their determination is the same as in the usual case when we use the kernel @xmath48 .      the best strategy for perturbation theory would be to use that kernel that is the most appropriate for the description of the given observable .",
    "the background of working with different kernels is very similar to using different schemes in the usual perturbation theory .",
    "if the bare lagrangian is the same , they should describe the same physics : now this is ensured by eq .",
    "( [ bare_ren_relation ] ) . here",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath50 should cancel each other , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined by the local , divergent part of the kernel counterterm .",
    "similarly , the coupling constant counterterms is determined by the divergences of the four point function .",
    "although we determine the counterterms order by order , the following statement ensures that in an @xmath5th order calculation the bare parameters of the lagrangian , as well as any observables are independent on the choice of the kernel , up to @xmath33 . as a consequence , at infinite order",
    ", we recover the same bare lagrangian , and obtain the same value for all observables , with any choice of the kernel .",
    "although the proof is essentially the same as in the standard case ( cf .",
    "@xcite , in particular the chapter `` oversubtractions '' ) it is worth to state here for our somewhat more generic case .",
    "first we observe that if we have a well defined renormalized theory with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then in a theory with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the bare lagrangian is the same , and so , nonperturbatively , we obtain the same results for all observables . in this case",
    "( [ bare_ren_relation ] ) is automatically satisfied for @xmath55 and @xmath56 if it was true for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this proves that in an infinite order perturbation theory the result is independent on the actual choice of the kernel . in finite order perturbation theory",
    ", however , order - by - order finiteness requires different counterterm structure for each kernels .",
    "we should prove that the results are stabilized below the order of the calculation @xmath33 .    at tree level",
    "there is no need for counterterms ( @xmath57 ) , and ( [ bare_ren_relation ] ) ensures that @xmath58 .",
    "at one loop level we have a one - loop self - energy @xmath59 $ ] , which is only overall divergent .",
    "when the regularization is fixed then we can determine the `` infinite part '' of a diagram , so we write @xmath60 = \\sigma^\\mathrm{div}_1[k ] + \\sigma^\\mathrm{fin}_1[k].\\ ] ] in order to ensure finiteness , we should choose the one loop kernel counterterm as @xmath61 + \\overline{\\delta      k}_1 $ ] , where @xmath62 is finite ( but , possibly , momentum dependent ) .",
    "then ( [ bare_ren_relation ] ) tells us that that the one - loop kernel @xmath63 has to satisfy @xmath64 + \\overline{\\delta k}_1 = k_0 + \\delta z_1      p^2 - \\delta m_1 ^ 2.\\ ] ] we then identify @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 .",
    "this latter equation states that @xmath67 , therefore @xmath68 + { { \\cal{o}}}(\\lambda^2)$ ] : this means that up to order @xmath69 it is independent of the choice of @xmath62 , ie . of the choice of the kernel .    what happens at higher order ?",
    "we write @xmath70 + \\overline{\\delta k}_1 $ ] .",
    "this means that we have a new quadratic counterterm to the lagrangian with kernel @xmath71 . at higher orders this counterterm",
    "should be included in any diagram @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "technically this means that we subsequently replace some propagators by @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath74 , this replacement means @xmath75 in functional manner .",
    "so , up to @xmath5 inclusions into the diagram , it can be formulated as @xmath76 the zeroth term is @xmath77 itself , the @xmath78 is the remnant of the @xmath79 factor of the @xmath5th order in the perturbative series .",
    "we can write it as an infinite sum minus the difference .",
    "but the infinite sum is just the taylor - series of @xmath80 = \\gamma[k_0]$ ] .",
    "so we find : @xmath81 ( 1- { { \\cal{o}}}(\\lambda^{n+1 } ) ) =   \\gamma[k_0 ]      ( 1- { { \\cal{o}}}(\\lambda^{n+1})).\\ ] ] we see , therefore , that the generated finite counterterm restores the value @xmath82 $ ] up to order @xmath83 .",
    "this means that any renormalized observable , which is represented by the sum of diagrams @xmath77 , is the same ( kernel - independent ) up to @xmath33 .",
    "since we did not use any specific property of @xmath84 which would exploit its one loop nature , the above statement can directly be generalized to higher orders .",
    "moreover , the same line of thought can be followed for the coupling constant , when it is momentum independent .",
    "this completes the proof of the second part of the statement .",
    "the same proof also applies to the counterterm structure",
    ". then we should use @xmath85 $ ] . at one loop level",
    "the value of @xmath86 $ ] defines the kernel counterterms . at higher ( @xmath5th )",
    "loop level the inclusion of @xmath62 finite counterterm will generate divergent contribution , which has to be made vanish by the @xmath5th order kernel counterterm .",
    "so @xmath87 contains the following contribution @xmath88}{{\\partial}k^n}(\\overline{\\delta k}_1)^n.\\ ] ] in the sum @xmath89 , therefore , we recover the subseries : @xmath90}{{\\partial}k^i}(\\overline{\\delta k}_1)^i = \\sigma^\\mathrm{div}_1[k_0 ] + { { \\cal{o}}}(\\lambda^{n+1}).\\ ] ] so , although the one loop counterterm depends on the kernel , the higher order counterterm contributions coming from @xmath62 inclusions ensure kernel independence up to @xmath33 .",
    "since this line of thought did not depend that we start at one loop level , it is valid for any other finite counterterm , and also the same line of thought applies to the coupling constant renormalization .",
    "this completes the proof of the first part of the statement .",
    "_ qed _    in practice , the most important question is the comparability of two perturbation theories , without a reference to the bare theory .",
    "the above statement claims that this can be ensured if we choose the parameters of scheme `` @xmath91 '' as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the parameters of scheme `` @xmath95 '' .",
    "these relations can be found either by the requirement that the bare lagrangian is the same ( first part of the above statement ) , or requiring that some observables has the same value in the two schemes .",
    "this latter strategy is the _ matching _ , which is a widely used technique in field theory ( cf .",
    "large mass decoupling @xcite or dimensional reduction @xcite ) .",
    "it works in our case in a way that we compute three observables from theory `` @xmath95 '' , and find those @xmath96 parameters that give the same result for these observables from a calculation in theory `` @xmath91 '' .",
    "the above statement then ensures that calculating any other observables , the difference between the results of the two schemes is of @xmath97 where @xmath5 is the order of the computation .",
    "the best is of course to choose that type of observables which can be calculated quite reliably from both schemes of perturbation theory .",
    "the area where we want to apply the perturbation theory with modified kernel is to optimize perturbation theory for finite temperature or in non - equilibrium calculations . at each temperatures we can use a kernel , which is optimized to that temperature . to compare the results at different temperatures , however , we have to match the renormalized parameters .",
    "a good set of quantities is the asymptotically large momentum regime observables at @xmath98 , since we expect that these observables should be independent of the details of the kernel at finite momenta , but still sensitive to the values of the renormalized parameters . in practical numerical calculations , of course",
    ", we should choose quantities at large , but not asymptotic momentum , and determine the matching procedure there .      for optimizing the kernel for a given environment",
    ", we can use the condition that the free propagator ( the inverse of the kernel ) is the exact one .",
    "then at any higher order diagrams the self - energy insertions , which would modify the free  in this case the exact  propagator , should be missing .",
    "so we should choose the kernel counterterms @xmath50 at each perturbative order in a way that it exactly cancels the corresponding self - energy @xmath99(p)$ ] , calculated with the kernel @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand the diagrams with self - energy insertions are exactly the 2-particle reducible diagrams .",
    "these are missing in this perturbation theory : therefore we realized 2pi resummation , differently from the technique of cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite .    in formula ,",

    "then , using @xmath112 as a kernel , we compute the _ zero temperature _ propagator and 4-point function .",
    "since the kernel was not optimized for @xmath98 calculation , we do not expect especially good convergence of perturbative series , but we do expect that the asymptotic regime will be well described .",
    "so we will choose large momenta ( eg . @xmath126 where @xmath127 - @xmath128 ) and match @xmath129 and @xmath130 at these momenta ( choosing together 3 matching conditions ) .",
