    "forming clusters of galaxies ( proto - clusters ) could provide information on the formation of large scale structure in the early universe .",
    "since a substantial number of galaxies can be detected at the same redshift and features in the spectral energy distribution can be studied systematically by choosing the appropriate filters , they are also ideal places to study galaxy evolution . by comparing proto - cluster galaxies to field galaxies , changes in in galaxy properties as a function of environment can be studied .",
    "an important issue is where to search for these proto - clusters . during the last decade evidence",
    "has accumulated that high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs , @xmath7 ) are forming brightest cluster galaxies at the centers of clusters or proto - clusters ( for an overview , see e.g.@xcite ) . supporting",
    "evidence includes : ( i ) hzrgs are amongst the most massive ellipticals in the early universe @xcite , ( ii ) they can have extreme radio rotation measures , indicative of dense hot gas @xcite and ( iii ) radio galaxies at @xmath8 lie in moderately rich clusters @xcite .",
    "a pilot project conducted on the very large telescope ( vlt ) to search for a proto - cluster around radio galaxy pks 1138262 at @xmath9 resulted in the detection of 15 ly@xmath0 emitters within 1000 km s@xmath10 of the central radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "this provided direct evidence that distant luminous radio galaxies can be used as tracers of proto - clusters .",
    "we initiated a vlt large program to search for ly@xmath0 emitters around hzrgs .",
    "to select the most likely progenitors of cd ellipticals , the radio galaxies in this program satisfied the following criteria : large radio luminosities , and bright optical and ir continua . to be able to find ly@xmath0 emitters , the redshift of the radio galaxies had to be suitable for ly@xmath0 imaging with the available vlt / fors narrowband filters . two objects at high redshift ( radio galaxies at @xmath11 and one at @xmath12 ) were added and for which a custom narrowband filter was purchased .",

    "roughly 400 candidate ly@xmath0 emitters were found , of which 162 were confirmed to be ly@xmath0 emitters near the redshift of the radio galaxy ( table [ lptable ] ) .",

    "one of the targets in our program was the radio galaxy mrc 0316257 .",
    "there were several additional reasons that this radio galaxy was chosen .",
    "first of all , it was already known that the object had two spectroscopically confirmed companions @xcite .",
    "secondly , the redshift of the radio galaxy ( @xmath15 ) allows for an efficient search for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and for [ oiii ] @xmath16 5007 emitters using a @xmath17-band narrowband filter mounted on an infrared camera .",
    "the field surrounding 0316257 was imaged in a narrowband for 6.5 hours , and 1.3 hours in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the vlt / fors2 camera . as part of an imaging program with the _ hubble space telescope _ , the field was observed for 3 orbits with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in the f814w filter . for each object detected in the narrowband image ,",
    "the line flux , continuum strength and continuum slope and their uncertainties were calculated using the measured narrowband and @xmath18 and @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "subsequently , with the derived line flux and continuum strength , the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath20 ) of the objects was computed .",
    "following @xcite , galaxies with a rest - frame equivalent width ew@xmath21 15   and a significance @xmath22 ew@xmath23 3 were selected as candidate ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "85 objects were marked as candidate emitters .",

    "the velocity distriburion of the 31 confirmed emitters has a fwhm of 1510 km s@xmath10 , which is much smaller than the width of the filter ( fwhm @xmath26 km s@xmath10 ) , and the peak of the velocity distribution is located within 200 km s@xmath10 of the redshift of the radio galaxy .",
    "the volume density of ly@xmath0 emitters within our narrowband filter is a factor 3.0 @xmath27 0.8 higher as compared to the volume density of field emitters ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because the structure is not virialized ( taking the velocity dispersion as a typical velocity",
    ", it would take a galaxy at least 5 gyr to cross the structure , while the age of the universe at @xmath15 is only 2.2 gyr ) , the virial theorem can not be used to calculate the mass of the proto - cluster . therefore ,",
    "following @xcite , we use the volume occupied by the proto - cluster , the mean density of the universe at @xmath15 , the measured galaxy overdensity and the bias parameter , the computed mass is in the range 25 @xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "because the structure does not seem to be bound in the fors images , this mass estimate is a lower limit .",

    "four of them , including the radio galaxy , appear to consist of several small ( half light radii @xmath31 1.8 kpc ) clumps , six are single , resolved objects and the rest ( seven ) are unresolved , single objects .",
    "the half light radii of the single objects range between @xmath32 and @xmath33 kpc .",

    "emitters with a high signal - to - noise spectrum show an asymmetric line profile with an absorbed blue wing . in those cases ,",
    "the lines were fitted by a gaussian emission line with one or more voigt absorption profiles .",
    "the inferred column densities of the absorbers are in the range of @xmath36@xmath37 cm@xmath29 .",

    "currently , we are investigating the other radio galaxy fields to confirm this .    at @xmath50",

    "studies of lbgs showed that only 2025% of the star forming , uv bright galaxies at @xmath54 have a ly@xmath0 line with an equivalent width @xmath13 20 @xcite . correcting for this incompleteness , then the sfrd around mrc 0316257",
