    "forest stand development has been studied for many decades , and a practical understanding of the general patterns and forms observed in the population dynamics is well established @xcite . however , despite the development of a great body of simulation models for multi - species communities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the elucidation of general rules for the structural development of monocultures is not clear .",
    "this is due in part to the huge variation in physiological and morphological traits of tree species , but also because of the importance of space and size dependent interactions .",
    "great progress has been made in the analysis of both size - structured ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and , more recently , spatially - structured population models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , an understanding of the dynamics of real communities , structured in both size and space , has been limited by a lack of application of simple models , amenable to analysis and approximation , to the communities in question @xcite .    an important concept in forest conservation and uneven - aged stand management",
    "is that of `` old - growth '' .",
    "this is an autogenic state which is obtained through an extended period of growth , mortality and regeneration , in the absence of external disturbances .",
    "it is often seen as an `` equilibrium '' state , and is characterised by a fully represented ( high variance ) age and size structure , and non - regular spatial pattern . depending on the species involved , it may take several centuries to attain @xcite .",
    "the habitat created in this state is generally considered a paradigm of what conservation oriented forest management might hope to achieve .    whilst marked point process simulations have recently been used to analyse the effects of plantation stand management @xcite , we seek to develop and directly apply a generic process - based model , which is closely related to those of @xcite and @xcite ) , to understanding the key elements of observed stand behaviour , from planting through to old - growth , which can also be applied to guide silviculture .",
    "our approach is illustrated via application to data on scots pine ( _ l .",
    "pinus syslvestris _ ) .",
    "transformation management aims to speed the transition to the old - growth state , from the starting point of a plantation stand .",
    "@xcite suggested methods for the attainment of this `` sustainable irregular condition '' ; some transformation experiments have taken place or are in progress @xcite , whilst other work has made more in - depth analysis of the structural characteristics of natural forest stands @xcite .",
    "an example of a `` semi - natural '' stand , of the type studied by @xcite is shown in figure 1 .",
    "however , the management history of such stands is generally not known sufficiently ( if at all ) before around 100 years ago , complicating parameter estimation and model validation .    a generic spatial , size - structured , individual based model of interacting sessile individuals",
    "is presented in section [ sec_model ] .",
    "parameters are estimated and the model assessed using data obtained from scots pine ( _ l .",
    "pinus sylvestris _ ) communities .",
    "section [ sec_results ] studies model dynamics : an initial growth dominated period gives way to a reduction in density and a meta - stable state governed by reproduction and mortality , all of which correspond with field observations of the growth of stands of a range of species . keeping in mind this long - term behaviour , section",
    "[ sec_manage ] considers examples of the application of management practices which may accelerate transformation .",
    "the model is a markovian stochastic birth - death - growth process in continuous ( two - dimensional ) space .",
    "individuals have fixed location , and a size which increases monotonically ; these jointly define the state space of the process .",
    "the model operates in continuous time by means of the gillespie algorithm @xcite ; this generates a series of events ( i.e. growths , births , deaths ) and inter - event times . after any given event ,",
    "the rate ( @xmath0 ) of every possible event that could occur next is computed .",
    "the time to the next event is drawn from an exponential distribution with rate @xmath1 ; the probability of a particular event occurring is @xmath2 .",
    "interaction between individuals plays a key role , operating on all population dynamic processes in the model .",
    "individuals interact with their neighbours by means of a predefined `` kernel '' which takes a value dependent upon their separation and size difference . assuming that interactions act additively , and that the effects of size difference and separation are independent",
    ", we define a measure of the competition felt by tree @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the set of all individuals excluding @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath6 is the size of tree @xmath3 and @xmath7 its position .",
    "we here consider a generic form for the interaction kernel ; a flexible framework implemented by @xcite .",
    "competitive inhibition is a gaussian function of distance to neighbours .",
    "this is then multiplied by the size of the competitor , and a @xmath8 function , which represents size asymmetry in the effects of competition .",
    "that is @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath8 function allows anything from symmetric ( @xmath11 ) to completely asymmetric competition ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "multiplying interaction by the size of the neighbour considered reflects the increased competition from larger individuals , independent of the size difference ( consider two tiny individuals with given separation / size - difference , compared to two large ones with the same separation / difference ) .",
    "we consider trees with a single size measure , `` dbh '' ( diameter at breast height ( 1.3 m ) ) , a widely used metric in forestry , due to its ease of measurement in the field .",
    "dbh has been shown to map linearly to exposed crown foliage diameter ( which governs light acquisition and seed production ) with minimal parameter variation across many species ( purves , unpublished data , and see @xcite ) .",
    "we use the gompertz model for individual growth @xcite , reduced by neighbourhood interactions @xcite .",
    "this leads to an asymptotic maximum size , and was found to be the best fitting , biologically accurate , descriptor of growth in statistical analysis of tree growth increment data ( results not shown ) .",
    "trees grow by fixed increments @xmath13 m at a rate @xmath14 in the absence of competition ( @xmath15 ) , the asymptotic size of an individual is thus @xmath16 . under intense competition , the right hand side of equation [ eqn_gomp ] may be negative . in this case",
    ", we fix @xmath17 ( similarly to e.g. @xcite ) . variation in @xmath18",
    "has minimal effect on dynamics provided it is sufficiently small that growth events happen frequently compared to mortality and birth .",
    "mortality of an established individual occurs at a rate @xmath19 @xmath20 is a fixed baseline @xcite , and @xmath21 causes individuals under intense competition to have an elevated mortality rate @xcite .",
    "exisiting individuals produce offspring of size @xmath22 m at a rate determined by their seed production .",
    "this is proportional to crown foliage area , and hence also to basal area .",
    "the individual rate of reproduction is thus @xmath23 .",
    "offspring are placed at a randomly selected location within 10 m of the parent tree with probability of establishment / survival @xmath24 .",
    "this approximation assumes @xmath25 years taken to reach initial size ( 0.01 m dbh ) and avoids introduction of time - lagged calculations , which would impair computational and mathematical tractability .",
    "the fecundity of trees and accurate quantification of seed establishment success is a long standing problem in forest ecology , due the combination of seed production , dispersal , neighbourhood and environmental effects involved @xcite .",
    "submodels for regeneration are often used , but due to data collection issues , precise definition of their structure and parameterisation is more difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the approximation described above effectively removes this stage of the life cycle from the model , allowing a focus on structure in mature individuals only .",
    "our presented simulations use an establishment time ( @xmath25 ) of 20 years , which is supported by field studies of scots pine regeneration ( sarah turner , unpublished data ) .",
    "community structure is tracked via various metrics : density ( number of individuals per m@xmath26 ) , total basal area ( @xmath27 ) , size and age density distributions , and pair correlation and mark correlation functions ( relative density and size multiple of pairs at given separation , @xcite ) .",
    "all presented model results ; means and standard deviations ( in figures , lines within grey envelopes ) are computed from 10 repeat simulation runs .",
    "the simulation arena represents a 1 ha plot ( @xmath28 m ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "results are not significantly altered by increasing arena size , but a smaller arena reduces the number of individuals to a level at which some statistics can not be computed accurately .",
    "we use data from two broad stand types ( collected in scotland by forest research , uk forestry commission ) : plantation and `` semi - natural '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "plantation datasets ( @xmath29 ha stands ) from glenmore ( highland , scotland ) incorporate location and size , allowing comparison of basic statistics at a single point in time ( stand age @xmath30 80 years ) .",
    "semi - natural data is available from several sources .",
    "spatial point pattern and increment core data ( measurements of annual diameter growth over the lifespan of each tree , at 1.0 m height ) for four @xmath31 stands in the black wood of rannoch ( perth and kinross , scotland ) allows estimation of growth ( and growth interaction ) parameters .",
    "location and size measurements ( at one point in time ) from a @xmath32 semi - natural stand in glen affric ( highland , scotland ) provide another basis for later comparison .    in none of the stands",
    "is there adequate information to reliably estimate mortality ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) or fecundity ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "these are thus tuned to satisfactorily meet plantation and steady state ( semi - natural stand ) density .",
    "the baseline mortality rate used gives an expected lifespan of 250 years @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear mixed effects ( nlme ) approach @xcite was used to estimate growth parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "best - fitting growth curves were computed for each of a subset of individuals from two of the rannoch plots , and the mean , standard deviation and correlation between each parameter within the population was estimated .",
    "details are given in appendix 1 , electronic supplementary materials ( esm ) .",
    "mean values for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are used for simulation , though large variation between individuals was observed .",
    "@xmath36 was difficult to estimate from the semi - natural data , its standard deviation being larger than its mean .",
    "however , it has a large effect on the simulated `` plantation '' size distribution , whilst semi - natural stand characteristics are relatively insensitive to its precise value ( appendix 2 , esm ) . therefore a value slightly lower than the estimated mean was used in order to better match the size distribution in both plantation and semi - natural stages .",
    "@xmath37 was selected to provide an interaction neighbourhood similar to previous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath38 determines early ( plantation ) size distribution , and was selected accordingly ( it has minimal effect on long - run behaviour ) .",
    "all parameter values used for simulation are shown in table [ tab_parametertable ] . sensitivity to parameter variation over broad intervals",
    "was also tested , a brief summary of which is provided in appendix 2 , esm .",
    "a standard planting regime implemented in scots pine plantations is a 2 m square lattice , typically on previously planted ground .",
    "old stumps and furrows prevent a perfectly regular structure being created , so our initial condition has 0.01 m dbh trees with small random deviations from exact lattice sites .",

    "this section simply presents the same results relating to management as those in section 4 of the main text ( `` acceleration of transition to old - growth state '' ) .",
    "the statistics computed using the model in which individual variation ( `` model 2 '' ) is allowed show a similar but slightly less clear pattern .",
    "temporal evolution of basal area and density show precisely the same pattern as those under the homogeneous growth model ( `` model 1 '' )  the longer the duration of management , the closer they remain to the steady state after thinning .    under model 1 ,",
    "the size distribution demonstrated a shift in canopy peak as the total duration of management increased , with a larger size and lower density ( figure 5c in main text ) . under model 2 ,",
    "the size distribution shows no increase in the size of trees in the canopy , only a reduction in density towards that of the steady - state distribution ( figure [ fig_manageapp]c here ) .",
    "this is due to the much lower mean asymptotic size under model 2 .",
    "with regards the pair correlation function ( pcf ) , the shift towards the steady state appears to be present but is also slightly less clear  the shift towards a clutered pattern being slower to occur under model 2 ( figure [ fig_manageapp]d here ) .
