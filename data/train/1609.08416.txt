    "as explained in example [ ex : doubly ] , the reversing channel @xmath277 can be applied also to an already reverse observable @xmath94 to obtain doubly reverse observable @xmath278 .",

    "since every state @xmath295 can be represented as a convex sum of elements in @xmath296 , we have that @xmath297 for every @xmath295 , and thus @xmath298 . combining this with prop .",
    "[ prop : incompatibility - m ] , we get analogous result to the previous eigenvalue conditions for povms and ppovms .
