    "@xcite has been the unavailability of an accurate model for the completeness of the _ kepler _  pipeline @xcite .",
    "previous planet occurrence determinations from _ kepler _  data have dealt with this shortcoming by employing simplifying assumptions as to the pipeline completeness : assume the theoretical performance of the transiting planet search algorithm ( tps * ? ? ?",

    "as exemplified in @xcite and @xcite , we undertake a sensitivity analysis where we iteratively change an input assumption and recalculate the occurrence rates .",
    "we investigate the following input assumptions : pipeline completeness systematics , orbital eccentricity , stellar parameter systematics , planet parameter systematics , and planet sample classification systematics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : compmod ] describes the pipeline completeness model that quantifies the survey completeness for any target observed by _ kepler_. sections  [ sec : stars ] and  [ sec : planets ] summarize the stellar properties and planet sample from the q1-q16 _ kepler _  pipeline run adopted for derivation of the planet occurrence rates .",
    "we extend the analysis techniques of @xcite by increasing the complexity of the parameterized model for the planet occurrence rate and employ markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) methods for solving the parameter estimation problem in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "section  [ sec : baseline ] presents results for the planet occurrence rate using a baseline set of inputs , and we thoroughly explore the systematic errors in this result through a sensitivity analysis in section  [ sec : sensit ] .",
    "we compare the occurrence rate analysis with previous efforts in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we apply the resulting occurrence rates to determine the occurrence rate for terrestrial planets with an orbital period equivalent to venus in section  [ sec : venus ] as well as extrapolating these results toward longer periods ( section  [ sec : extrap ] ) in order to measure a one year terrestrial planet occurrence rate in section  [ sec : earth ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the future work necessary to improve the accuracy for the resulting planet occurrence rates .",
    "this section details an analytic star - by - star model for the _ kepler _  pipeline completeness . a critical component for modeling the completeness of _ kepler _",
    "observations is simulating the performance of the tps pipeline module which is responsible for characterizing the noise present in a light curve and detection of the transit signals @xcite .",
    "the performance of a transit survey can be fully specified with intensive , end - to - end monte carlo signal injection and recovery tests @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to their numerically intensive nature , monte - carlo injection tests are not amenable to a systematic sensitivity analysis , and the tests are limited to the subset of targets that one performs the analysis upon .",
    "therefore , we present a simplified analytic model for the _ kepler _  pipeline that can be readily applied to any observed _ kepler _  target using a minimum of input data . fortunately , the joint noise characterization , filtering , and detection properties of tps were designed to facilitate a well defined and tested detector response for transit signals even in the presence of astrophysical broad - band or red noise @xcite . given the well defined properties of the tps detector , our analytic completeness model can achieve high fidelity after it is calibrated with monte - carlo injection tests . for a single target , we parameterize the pipeline completeness over a two - dimensional grid of orbital period , @xmath3 , and planet radius , @xmath1 .",
    "modeling pipeline completeness requires modeling the statistical behavior of tps and its response to noise in the presence of a signal @xcite . in the presence of broad - band red noise",
    ", tps considers the so - called multiple event statistic ( mes ) to measure the strength of a potential transit signal . in the null hypothesis case of no signal present , the mes distribution is gaussian with an average of zero and unit variance . in the alternative hypothesis case for the presence of a signal ,",
    "the mes distribution is gaussian but the average mes is shifted proportional to the snr of the transit signal .",
    "the first step for modeling pipeline completeness is to estimate the expected mes of a transit signal for a specified @xmath3  and @xmath1 .",
    "this requires an estimate of the expected transit duration , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the orbital eccentricity and the stellar radius , @xmath11 , and orbital semi - major axis , @xmath12 , are in a consistent set of units . in equation  ( [ eq : trandur ] ) , we assume @xmath1@xmath13@xmath11 , shorten the transit duration from the central crossing time by a factor of @xmath14 for its expectation assuming a uniform distribution of @xmath15 for the orbital inclination @xcite , and include the expected dependence on the transit duration with @xmath10 @xcite . we explore the sensitivity of our results to @xmath16 in section  [ sec : sensitecc ] .",
    "next , we determine the noise present in the light curve data averaged over the transit duration of interest .",
    "tps estimates the time varying noise present in a light curve , the so - called combined differential photometric precision ( cdpp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "cdpp varies with time and is calculated over the same 14 transit durations , @xmath17\\ , { \\rm hr}$ ] , that are used in the transiting planet search ( see figure  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "for the analytic completeness model , we employ a summary statistic , a robust root - mean - square of the cdpp ( robcdpp ) , for the light curve noise .",
    "in testing it was found that the non - robust root - mean - square cdpp ( rmscdpp ) statistic typically reported by the q1-q16 pipeline data products ( soc build 9.2 and earlier ) can be biased .",
    "the bias in the rmscdpp arises when the distribution formed from the cdpp time series values is asymmetric with the outlying tail of the distribution inordinately affecting the results .",
    "we calculate robcdpp by replacing the typical components of the root - mean - square that includes the mean / dc component @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean and @xmath20 is the standard deviation , with their robust equivalents @xmath21 where mad is the median absolute deviation .",
    "the robcdpp is calculated after removing both invalid and deweighted data identified in the same manner as during the transit search . in order to remove the influence of strong signals in estimating the noise present in a light curve",
    ", the robcdpp value adopted for the completeness model is calculated on the light curve after all the potential transit signatures have been removed in the data validation ( dv ) multiple planet search @xcite . on average ,",
    "the robcdpp to rmscdpp ratio is 1.03 with a sample standard deviation of 0.06 .",
    "a higher fidelity model of pipeline completeness would employ the full cdpp time series .",
    "however , in tests we find that when the number of expected transits contributing to a detection , @xmath22 , the robcdpp summary is sufficient to model pipeline completeness rather than a more time - consuming calculation involving the full cdpp time series ( see section  [ sec : compexample ] ) .    for a given @xmath23 , we interpolate within the grid of 14 robcdpp values to estimate the noise for that duration , @xmath24 . for values of @xmath23 outside the @xmath25 grid ,",
    "we adopt the end point robcdpp for @xmath24 .",
    "alternative extrapolation methods such as assuming a @xmath26 dependence or linear extrapolation were not stable for the sometimes complicated behavior of robcdpp as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "the next step is to estimate the expected transit signal depth , @xmath27 .",
    "since the tps search algorithm employs a square box - car signal template match to the signal for detection , the appropriate @xmath27 is the average signal depth over @xmath23 rather than the purely geometric depth @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the physical radius ratio . from the results of the transit injection study of @xcite",
    ", we determine that for limb darkened transit signals , on average @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the depth at closest approach or maximum transit depth .",
    "when averaged over a uniform distribution of impact parameter , @xmath32 , we find using the limb darkened transit model of @xcite that @xmath33 is well fit by a linear relationship with parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 that vary with the limb darkening profile of the stellar intensity .",
    "when using a linear limb darkening law , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the stellar intensity relative to the stellar center , @xmath38 is the linear coefficient , and @xmath39 is the line - of - sight stellar - surface - normal angle , with a coefficient appropriate for g dwarfs , @xmath40 , we determine best fit values of ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are weakly dependent upon limb darkening , taking on values ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 and ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) for @xmath48 .",
    "the needed value of @xmath27 is expressible in terms of @xmath29 using the previous equations to provide the single transit event snr , @xmath49 .",
    "the mes is calculated by averaging the transit signal strength over multiple transit events .",
    "the resulting mes=@xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the expected number of transit events , @xmath52 is the time baseline of observational coverage for a target and @xmath53 is the observing duty cycle .",
    "the observing duty cycle , @xmath53 , is defined as the fraction of @xmath52 with valid observations .",
    "the _ kepler _  spacecraft experiences planned data gaps for data download and other spacecraft operations .",
    "these data gaps result in an overall duty cycle of @xmath54% for targets observed for all quarters .",
    "in addition , the duty cycle is suppressed further in the transit search to @xmath55% by a set of data weights applied in tps .",
    "data near gaps suffers from spacecraft systematics , thus tps deweights data near gaps using a smooth exponential decay functional form that goes from fully deweighted data at the gap edge to full data weighting over a span of 2  days .",
    "we calculate @xmath53 by dividing the number of cadences with an overall deweighting factor @xmath56 by the total number of cadences within @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , we force a floor of @xmath57 in the mes estimate since tps requires at least 3 transit events for detection . @xmath52 and @xmath58 are calculated in the initial call to tps before transit signals have been identified and removed by dv .",
    "the tps search algorithm design results in a well - defined pipeline completeness that is , in the limit of broadband noise , a function of mes alone @xcite .",
    "since the tps detection statistic , mes , is distributed as a gaussian with unit variance , the pipeline completeness ( fraction of transit signals present in the data that are recovered by the pipeline ) has a theoretical expected form of @xmath59,\\label{eq : tpsthy}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the adopted detection threshold @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of stochastic , impulsive systematics of instrumental or astrophysical origin in the time series that are not due to a transit signal results in an overwhelming number of false alarm detections when mes is the only criteria employed for detection . in the q1-q16 pipeline run",
    ", 57% of targets result in a detection when based upon mes alone @xcite . to mitigate the false positive detections , additional criteria ( or vetoes )",
    "are employed that quantify how consistent the depths , shape , and duration of individual events are with each other @xcite .",
    "the additional vetoes cause the pipeline completeness to be suppressed relative to the theoretical expectation given in equation  ( [ eq : tpsthy ] ) .",
    "@xcite quantify the resulting suppression of the pipeline completeness through monte - carlo transit injection and recovery tests .",
    "they find that the gamma cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) provides a good fit to the suppressed pipeline completeness , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the gamma function and the argument to the gamma cdf , @xmath63 , is related to mes by an offset of 4.1 in order to achieve a good fit .",
    "the parameters for the gamma cdf adopted for this study are @xmath12=4.65 and @xmath32=0.98 . in rare cases , due to the timeout limits of the tps planet search ,",
    "mes@xmath64 is higher than the normal mes@xmath64=7.1 .",
    "section  [ sec : mes ] can be used to provide a mapping for the 2d grid of @xmath1  and @xmath3  onto mes .",
    "the pipeline detection efficiency provides a mapping from the mes to the pipeline completeness .",
    "the final component of the pipeline completeness model accounts for the limits of the data coverage for meeting the planet search detection requirement of having at least @xmath65 .",
    "the transit survey window function , @xmath66 , quantifies the probability that a requisite number of transits required for detection occurs in the observational data @xcite . since _",
    "_  operates in the high duty cycle regime , we adopt the binomial analytic window function as discussed in @xcite and originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "the analytic window function matches the average behavior of the fully numerical window function ( see figure  9 of * ? ? ?",

    "results for small samples or individual targets may systematically differ from the average pipeline completeness results of @xcite .",

    "in addition , we are implementing support for @xmath83 transit injections on a single target employing the nasa ames pleiades super computing facility @xcite .",
    "an additional shortcoming of any pipeline completeness model is the inescapable dependence on the assumed stellar parameters , eccentricity , and stellar binarity .",

    "<S> , we find that the one year orbital period terrestrial planet occurrence rate , @xmath6=0.1 , with an allowed range of 0.01@xmath72 , where @xmath6 is defined as the number of planets per star within 20% of the @xmath1  and @xmath3  of earth . for g  dwarf hosts , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 parameter space is a subset of the larger @xmath8 parameter space , thus @xmath6 places a lower limit on @xmath8 for g  dwarf hosts . from our analysis </S>",
