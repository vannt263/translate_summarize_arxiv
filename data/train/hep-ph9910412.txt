    "in the twilight zone between perturbative and non - perturbative qcd , there lives heavy quarkonium physics . indeed , while the large mass ( @xmath0 ) of the charm and bottom quarks allows for a perturbative evaluation of their production cross sections , still the physics of their binding into observable charmonium and bottomonium states unavoidably involves low - scale , and therefore non - perturbative , phenomena .",

    "it is worth noting that , aside for the constant terms in @xmath22 $ ] and the colour of the final state , this structure does not depend on what exactly @xmath17 is .",
    "another process displaying large threshold corrections is @xmath37 . the total cross section reads & = & ( ( 1-x)+ \\ { ( 1-x ) .. + & + & + & + & .. ( ) _ + f_q|q[](x ) } ) , where p_qq(x ) = ( ) _ qq(x ) = . and , as before ,",

    "this cross section can also be seen to be free of an explicit @xmath6 dependence .",
    "resummation techniques for these large threshold logarithms have been developed in @xcite and more recently applied to heavy quark production  @xcite .",
    "soft gluon resummation for processes also involving non - perturbative matrix elements , namely radiative and semileptonic @xmath42 decays within heavy quark effective theory , have also been considered in @xcite .    upon inspection",
    ", one can see that the soft limits of the amplitudes projected onto some specific @xmath2 $ ] state are identical , up to this order , to the ones for open heavy quark production .",
    "such soft limits , derived in @xcite , read , for the gluon  gluon channel and for colour - singlet and -octet production respectively , & & _ col , pol||^2 = 4c_a 2ab _ col , pol||^2 , + & & _ col , pol||^2 = 4c_a _ col , pol||^2 , where @xmath43 are , respectively , the momenta of the incoming gluons , the outgoing heavy @xmath4 pair , and the emitted soft gluon .",

    "phenomenological cross sections are obtained via inverse mellin transform of eq .",
    "( [ resummed ] ) , to be performed numerically .",
    "many problems are to be found at this stage , both of conceptual and technical nature .",
    "for instance , to take care of the presence of the landau pole we shall adopt the so - called minimal prescription introduced in @xcite : the integration contour for the inverse mellin transform passes to the right of all singularities in the complex @xmath33-plane , but to the left of the landau pole at @xmath62 .",
    "technical problems are instead related to the difficulty of performing the required integrals , due to the resummation function @xmath63 being strongly oscillating in @xmath64-space close to @xmath30 .",
    "the are taken care of by a subtraction procedure similar to the one described in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the following",
    "we shall present some plots showing the effect of the soft - gluon resummation described in the previous section .",
    "hadron level results are obtained with the cteq3 m parton distribution function ( pdf ) set , unless otherwise stated .",
    "nrqcd matrix elements for @xmath4 level final states ( i.e. not real physical quarkonium states ) are fixed , for @xmath14-states , at the value number of polarization states @xmath65 number of colours of the @xmath4 pair .",
    "if replaced with the real values , in units of gev@xmath66 for @xmath14-states and gev@xmath67 for @xmath68-states , the cross sections would be in nanobarns .",
    "we shall first study the renormalization / factorization scale dependence of a fictitious heavy quarkonium made up of 50 gev quarks .",
    "charmonium and bottomonium are very close to the non - perturbative region , and the large value of the strong coupling at such low scales makes the results less readily readable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m50 ] resummation effects are shown at 200 and 500 gev centre - of - mass energies , as a function of the renormalization / factorization scale @xmath69 .",

    "gluon channel is considered here .",
    "while the leading order result displays the usual monotonical dependence , and the nlo one presents a maximum at pretty small values of @xmath69 , the resummed result can be seen to be markedly less dependent on the arbitrary scale .",
    "one can also see resummation effects to be larger closer to the threshold , at @xmath71  gev , than at 500 gev , as expected . in both cases",
    "a sizeable increase with respect to the nlo prediction with @xmath72 can be observed .",
    "results for other states produced via the gluon  gluon channel , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 , both in the colour singlet and octet states , and @xmath75}$ ] , appear qualitatively similar .",
    "these plots suggest that a small value of the renormalization / factorization scale should be chosen in the nlo calculation in order to obtain a more realistic prediction for the cross section .",
    "we can also speculate that the value @xmath76 , rather than @xmath77 , should be chosen as the central one for the renormalization and factorization scale , despite the @xmath78 terms appearing in the nlo calculation .",
    "a variation in the range @xmath79 $ ] would then still span a large fraction of the nlo band and give a pretty small uncertainty with the nlo+nll result .",
    "qualitatively similar results are found in the @xmath80 channel for production of a @xmath81}$ ] state .",
    "figure  [ fig : m50-qq ] shows the dependence of the cross section on the renormalization / factorization scale at @xmath71 and 500 gev .",
    "again , the nlo+nll result can be seen to be more stable than the fixed - order nlo one .",
    "+    one can , of course , also try to vary the renormalization scale @xmath28 and the factorization scale @xmath29 independently . according to the observation made above on",
    "the `` best '' scales central value , we now fix one of the scales at @xmath82 ( rather than @xmath77 ) and we vary the other in the range @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : m50-murmuf ] that the remarkable independence seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m50 ] is unfortunately at least partially lost , especially when going to large factorization scales .",
    "independent scale variations in the @xmath45 channel give a similar outcome .",
    "these results are qualitatively similar to those reported in @xcite , where soft - gluon resummation in prompt - photon hadroproduction is studied , indicating that they are not specific to bound states production .",
    "they are moreover identical to what can be obtained by making @xmath82 even as large as the top quark mass , i.e. 175 gev .",
    "this suggests that , when studying the overall dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales , one should always take care to vary them independently .",
    "we now move to studying real quarkonium states , i.e. made up of charm or bottom quarks . in these cases , and especially for charmonium , the not - so - large mass of the heavy quark , and hence the relatively large value of the running coupling at these scales , will produce less clear - cut results than the ones previously displayed .",
    "figure  [ fig : bottom ] is a scaled - down version of fig .",
    "[ fig : m50 ] , meaning that both the mass of the heavy quark and the centre - of - mass energy are scaled down by a factor of 10 , to yield @xmath84  gev and @xmath85 and 50  gev .",
    "we can see that , while the behaviour with respect to scale variations is the same , even after resumming the soft - gluon logs the cross section does however retain a larger dependence than in the @xmath86  gev case , as expected . as before ,",
    "the nlo+nll result predicts larger cross sections than the nlo one with a central scale choice .",
    "once again , qualitatively similar results are found for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , both in the colour singlet and octet states , and for @xmath75}$ ] .",
    "production of a @xmath81}$ ] bottomonium state in @xmath80 interactions can also be considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : bottom - qq ] shows the dependence of the cross section on the renormalization / factorization scale at @xmath85 and 50 gev . at 50 gev centre - of - mass energy the nlo+nll result can be seen to be slightly more stable than the fixed - order nlo one , confirming the trend observed in @xmath87 collisions .",
    "less is instead to be gained closer to the threshold , at @xmath85 gev .",
    "one can finally also try studying charmonium hadroproduction .",
    "figure  [ fig : charm ] shows the renormalization / factorization scale dependence for production of @xmath70}$ ] and @xmath81}$ ] charm bound states in @xmath88 collisions at 20 gev centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the parton distribution function set cteq4lq ( i.e. low @xmath89 , valid down to @xmath90  gev ) is used , since very small scales are probed .",
    "moreover , the scales are not varied below @xmath91  gev , already at the borderline of both perturbative qcd and the validity range of the pdf set .",
    "one can see from the plots that the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales is once more lessened when soft gluon resummation is included .",
    "however , the improvement is less than in the bottomonium case , as expected , the scale involved here being extremely close to the non - perturbative region",
    "this paper only provides a first step towards a full understanding of soft - gluon effects in heavy quarkonium physics , as a number of questions remain to be addressed .",
    "the nlo cross sections we have studied here do not present the need for an explicit subtraction of infrared singularities to be absorbed into the non - perturbative nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "such singularities are however expected to appear in higher orders , as they do for instance in the two - loop evaluation of @xmath92 decay into leptons  @xcite .",
    "the resummation function @xmath93 will then have to be modified accordingly , so as to reflect the presence of this new factorization scale @xmath94 , in the same way it contains the pdf s factorization scale @xmath95 .",
    "this will avoid double counting of contributions already included somewhere else .",
    "it is also conceivable that the interplay of this subtraction with the one of coulomb terms , which are also absorbed , already at the one - loop level , into the nrqcd matrix elements , will have to be carefully considered .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fixed order nlo cross sections were evaluated , the need for an explicit subtraction of infrared singularities , and hence the appearance of the nrqcd factorization scale @xmath96 , is however in one case already met at order @xmath61 .",
    "this happens when studying the production of a @xmath68-wave state via the @xmath45 channel .",
    "when the emitted gluon becomes soft , the ensuing singularity can only be cancelled by adding the corresponding @xmath97-state process , in full accordance with the general nrqcd factorization formula  ( [ eq - fm ] ) ( see also section 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . in this case",
    "we find indeed that the soft limit of the @xmath98-state@xmath99 process amplitude does not factorize onto @xmath98-state and no gluons , this cross section being actually zero , but rather onto the matrix element squared for @xmath97-state .",
    "this implies a different framework for achieving soft - gluon resummation , which will conceivably be closely interlaced with the structure of the nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of resumming soft gluons in some selected heavy quarkonium hadroproduction processes .",
    "the inclusion of resummation effects leads in many cases to sizeably larger cross sections than those given by the fixed order nlo result with central renormalization / factorization scales .",
    "moreover , improvements in the dependence of the cross sections on the renormalization and factorization scales can be observed , especially when they are kept equal .",
    "we have also pointed out that less marked improvements appear when we vary them independently , leading to an uncertainty band a little larger than what would be otherwise obtained .",
    "a full systematic analysis of soft - gluon resummation in heavy quarkonium processes , with phenomenologically relevant results , is in progress , as is the one of the open questions briefly described in the previous section .",
