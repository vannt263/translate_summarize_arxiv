    "the study of one - dimensional quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium offers several fundamental challenges .",
    "a main question is whether an isolated quantum system can or not thermalize after a quench .",
    "while a relationship between quantum chaos and thermalization is certain to exist @xcite , an ongoing controversy is the occurrence of thermalization for a chaotic system in the gapped phase @xcite . in terms of transport properties ,",
    "the discussions are associated with the expected dynamical behavior of systems in the integrable and nonintegrable regimes @xcite , and in the gapped and gapless phases @xcite .",
    "extraordinary technological advances have motivated the use of experiments to address these issues . in this work",
    "we show how these experiments may benefit from dynamical decoupling methods to accurately reach the different regimes and phases of interest .",
    "the fundamental questions raised above have found a test - bed in experiments with ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices @xcite and with magnetic compounds @xcite .",
    "both systems require a high level of controllability . in optical lattices , control of atomic transport",
    "is achieved with time - dependent variations of the depth and phase of the lattice potential ; whereas in magnetic systems the preparation of samples where impurities and unwanted couplings are negligible is key for obtaining a desired transport behavior .",
    "in addition to monitoring experimental conditions , we advocate the use of sequences of external electromagnetic field pulses to manipulate the dynamics of the systems .",
    "this method of quantum control has long been employed in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy @xcite . there , the hamiltonian of nuclear spin systems is modified with sequences of unitary transformations ( radio - frequency pulses ) , which constantly rotate the spins and remove or rescale selected terms of the original hamiltonian .",
    "these techniques have acquired a new dimension in the context of quantum information processing @xcite , where the studies of transport of information @xcite and the manipulation of electron spins with ultrafast laser pulses @xcite are among the latest developments .",
    "recently , these methods have been proposed also for the control of atomic transport in spinor optical lattices  @xcite .    in the present work we use the theory developed in nmr to construct sequences of control operations that appropriately modify the hamiltonian of a one - dimensional quantum many - body system and",
    "forces it to follow a desired dynamics .",
    "the systems analyzed are modeled by spin-1/2 chains , which may also be mapped onto systems of spinless fermions or hardcore bosons .",
    "we focus on limits that are of interest for studies of transport behavior and thermalization .",
    "specifically , our goals are ( i ) to dynamically remove the effects of terms leading to the onset of chaos , such as disorder and frustration , and compel the chain to evolve as an integrable system , as introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ; ( ii ) to dynamically increase the effects of terms that can drive the system across a transition from the gapless to the gapped phase ( and vice - versa ) , aiming , for example , at forcing a conductor to behave as an insulator or at bringing a chaotic system into the gapped phase .",
    "for the gapless - gapped transition , the strengths of the coupling terms in the hamiltonian are modified by applying to the target system sequences with different time intervals between the control operations .",
    "the idea of varying the time separation between pulses has been exploited in sequences created to suppress the couplings between a qubit and its environment @xcite .",
    "contrary to that , the systems considered here are isolated from the environment and our objective is not necessarily to completely eliminate couplings , but instead to control their strengths .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii describes the model under investigation .",
    "iii reviews a technique to design control sequences , which is based on the average hamiltonian theory .",
    "iv presents in detail sequences that dynamically lead the system studied across a transition between the nonintegrable and integrable limits and between the gapless and gapped phases .",
    "numerical results are shown for the time evolution of local magnetization based on a particular initial state .",
    "a discussion about control metrics and the dependence of the outcomes on initial states is left for the appendix .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",

    "we expect an initial state with energy far from the edges of the spectrum to show a dynamical behavior typical of a chaotic system @xcite , although slowed down by a factor @xmath72 .",
    "a variety of new pulse sequences may be designed according to our needs and experimental capabilities .",
    "for instance , the sequence described above , which has no effect on nnn couplings , could be combined with a sequence of @xmath31-pulses in the @xmath8 direction given by    @xmath73 these pulses would affect only the flip - flop term of @xmath74 . the combined sequence would reduce the strength of @xmath29 and keep only the ising interaction from @xmath74 . hamiltonians similar to this resulting one have been analyzed in the context of transport @xcite and thermalization in gapped systems @xcite .",
    "we studied how quantum control methods may be used to manipulate the dynamics of quantum many - body systems .",
    "this is accomplished with sequences of unitary transformations designed to achieve a desired evolution operator .",
    "the unitary transformations correspond to instantaneous electromagnetic field pulses , which , in the case of spin systems , rotate the spins by a certain angle .",
    "the strategy employed to construct the control sequences was the average hamiltonian theory .",
    "four target spin-1/2 chains were considered .",
    "two were chaotic : ( i ) disordered with nn exchange , ( ii ) clean with nn exchange and nnn frustrating couplings ; and two were in the gapless phase : ( iii ) clean with nn couplings and small ising interaction , ( iv ) clean with nn couplings and weak frustration .",
    "we discussed sequences of control pulses aiming at averaging out the effects of disorder , in case ( i ) , and the effects of nnn couplings , in case ( ii ) , and then induce in these chaotic systems a dynamical behavior typical of an integrable clean chain with only nn exchange .",
    "we also developed new sequences capable of changing the ratio between the coupling strengths of the system .",
    "this was done by exploiting , in the same sequence , different time intervals between the pulses , so that the effects of specific terms in the hamiltonian may be reduced , but not necessarily eliminated . by dynamically decreasing the weight of the flip - flop term in ( iii ) , we obtained a time evolution characteristic of gapped systems with large ising interaction ( also mentioned was a scheme to achieve the dynamics of a metal out of an insulator ) . by decreasing the strength of the nn couplings with respect to the nnn exchange in ( iv ) , we obtained the dynamical behavior of a chain in the limit of strong frustration ( also mentioned was a way to combine to this scheme a sequence that removes the nnn flip - flop term ) .",
    "site addressability and the possibility to vary the time intervals between pulses add versatility to dynamical decoupling schemes and open an array of new opportunities for controlling quantum systems .",

    "this choice was motivated by works on transport properties and thermalization , where quantities of experimental interest are usually considered . the decision to take the particular initial state where all up - spins are in the first half of the chain was a way to connect our results with previous transport studies @xcite , and also to provide a good illustration , since states where @xmath75 would not give much information . however , in order to quantify how successful the designed control sequences are in general , we need an appropriate control metric which is independent of the initial state .",
