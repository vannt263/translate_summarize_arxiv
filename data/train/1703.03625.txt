    "the most classical numerical scheme for stochastic equations is the so - called euler scheme ( or first - order taylor scheme ) , which is recursively defined as follows on the uniform partition : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 for a function @xmath34 .",
    "however , it is easily seen ( see e.g @xcite for details ) that the euler scheme is divergent when the hurst parameter @xmath35 is less than @xmath36 . to obtain a convergent numerical approximation in this rough situation ,",
    "higher - order terms from the taylor expansion need to be included in the scheme . having the rough paths construction in mind ,",
    "the simplest method of this kind is the milstein scheme , or second - order taylor scheme .",
    "it can be expressed recursively as : @xmath37 where we have used notation [ not : iterated - vector - field ] and where @xmath38 designates the second - order iterated integral of @xmath4 ( see section [ section3.1 ] for a proper definition ) .",
    "this numerical approximation has first been considered in @xcite , and has been shown to be convergent as long as @xmath39 , with an almost sure convergence rate @xmath40 . here and in the following @xmath41 represents an arbitrarily small constant .",
    "an extension of the result to @xmath42th - order taylor schemes and to an abstract rough path with arbitrary regularity is contained in @xcite ; see also  @xcite for the optimized @xmath42th - order taylor scheme when @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath42th - order taylor schemes of the form are , however , not implementable in general .",
    "this is due to the fact that when @xmath43 the terms @xmath44 can not be simulated exactly and have to be approximated on their own .",
    "we now mention some contributions giving implementable versions of for stochastic differential equation .",
    "they all rely on some cancellation of the randomness in the error process @xmath45 related to our standing equation .    _",
    "( i ) _ the first second - order implementable scheme for has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed in the following form : @xmath46 this scheme has been shown to have convergence rate of order @xmath47 , and the proof relies on the fact that is the 2nd - order taylor scheme for the wong - zakai approximation of equation .",
    "the approximation has been extended in @xcite to a third - order scheme defined as follows : @xmath48 thanks to a thorough analysis of differences of iterated integrals between two gaussian processes , a convergence rate @xmath49 has been achieved for the scheme .",
    "one should also notice that @xcite handles in fact very general gaussian processes , as long as their covariance function is regular enough in the @xmath50-variation sense .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ a different direction has been considered in @xcite , where the following first - order ( meaning first - order with respect to the increments of @xmath4 ) scheme has been introduced : @xmath51 this approximation is called modified euler scheme in @xcite . as has been explained in @xcite ,",
    "the modified euler scheme is a natural generalization of the classical euler scheme of the stratonovich sde to the rough sde .",
    "for this reason , we will call the euler scheme from now on . as the reader might also see from relation  ,",
    "one gets the euler scheme from the second - order taylor scheme by changing the terms @xmath44 into their respective expected values .",
    "note that since the euler scheme does not involve products of increments of the underlying fbm , its computation cost is much lower than those of   and  . in spite of this cost reduction , an exact rate of convergence",
    "@xmath52 has been achieved in  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic error distributions and the weak convergence of the scheme have also been considered , and those results heavily hinge on malliavin calculus considerations .",
    "notice however that the results in @xcite are restricted to the case @xmath53 .",
    "having recalled those previous results , the aim of the current paper is quite simple : we wish to extend the results concerning the euler scheme   to a truly rough situation .",
    "namely , we will consider equation driven by a fractional brownian motion @xmath4 with @xmath54 .",
    "for this equation , we show that the euler scheme maintains the rate of convergence @xmath55 , which is the same as the third - order implementable scheme in .",
    "we also obtain some asymptotic results for the error distribution of the numerical scheme  , which generalize the corresponding results in @xcite to the case @xmath56 .",
    "more specifically , we will prove the following results ( see theorems [ thm7.3 ] and [ thm9.1 ] for more precise statements ) .",

    "let us highlight the fact that our approach does not rely on the special structure of the numerical scheme and does not require the analysis of the wong - zakai approximation .",
    "in fact , it provides a general procedure for studying time - discrete numerical approximations of rdes , including the implementable schemes and we just mentioned , the backward euler scheme , the crank - nicolson scheme and its modifications , taylor schemes and their modifications introduced in @xcite and so on .",
    "let us now explain briefly our strategy in order to prove theorem [ thm : cvgce - scheme ] :    @xmath65 the fact that we are replacing the terms @xmath44 in by their expectations forces us to thoroughly analyze some discrete weighted sums in the second chaos of @xmath4 .",
    "this will be a substantial part of our computations .",
    "@xmath66 then we have to get some uniform bounds ( in @xmath42 ) for the numerical scheme and the related linear rdes like .",
    "this will be done thanks to some discrete time rough paths type techniques , which replace the malliavin calculus arguments invoked in @xcite .",
    "a special attention has obviously to be paid in order to handle the terms @xmath67 in  .",
    "also note that the numerical scheme will be reduced to a differential equation driven by a process in the second chaos ( see ) .",
    "hence we can not rely on the integrability of the malliavin derivative of @xmath20 , which is a linear rdes driven by the scheme process .",
    "@xmath68 one of the main ingredient of our proofs is to consider @xmath69 as a rough path , where @xmath70 is a constant less than @xmath71 .",
    "this property will be proved by analyzing some crossed integrals between the 3 components of the process @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath72 eventually , our limit theorems are obtained by considering the asymptotic behavior of a rough linear equation describing the evolution of the error @xmath45 , the center of which is a weighted - variation term , or in our point of view , a `` discrete '' rough integral .",
    "if we compare the above ingredients with those in @xcite , one can see that the gap between the rough and the non - rough situations is substantial .",
    "new ideas are required for every step ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "this corresponds to the steps where the gap between the rough and the non rough situations is particularly large .    among the ingredients we have alluded to above ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of weighted variations has been received a lot of attention in recent works ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our approach to this problem relies on a combination of rough paths and malliavin calculus tools , and might have an interest in its own right ; see theorem  [ prop9.2 ] for the precise statement . indeed , with respect to the aforementioned results",
    ", it seems that we can reach a more general class of weights .",
    "we are also able to consider the variations for multi - dimensional fbms , thanks to a simple approximation argument on the simplex .",
    "eventually let us stress the fact that , though we have restricted our analysis to equations driven by a fractional brownian motion here for sake of simplicity , we believe that our results can be extended to a general class of gaussian processes whose covariance function satisfies reasonable assumptions ( such as the ones exhibited in @xcite ) .",
    "in this case , if @xmath73 denotes the centered gaussian process at stake , we expect the numerical scheme to become : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a deterministic constant defined by @xmath76 and where we have assumed that @xmath73 has stationary increments .",
    "notice however that ( similar to what is done in @xcite ) one can prove that in general the euler scheme is divergent when one considers an equation driven by a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath77 .",
    "our analysis is thus restricted to a rough signal with hlder regularity greater than @xmath78 .    here",
    "is how our paper is structured : in section [ section2 ] , we recall some results from the theory of rough paths , and prove a discrete version of the sewing map lemma . in section [ section3 ] ,",
    "we consider the fractional brownian motion as a rough path and derive some elementary results . in section [ section4i ]",
    "we first develop some useful upper - bound estimates , and then we introduce a general limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of weighted random sums . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we consider the couple @xmath79 as a rough path and show that it is uniformly bounded in @xmath42 . in section  [ section5 ] we show that the euler scheme @xmath20 is convergent , and we derive our first result on the rate of strong convergence of @xmath20 .",
    "we also derive some estimates on the error process @xmath45 .",
    "section [ section6 ] is devoted to an elaboration of the estimates for the error process under some new conditions .",
    "this leads , in section [ section7 ] , to consider the rate of strong convergence of the euler scheme again , improving the results obtained in section [ section5 ] up to an optimal rate . in section [ section9 ]",
