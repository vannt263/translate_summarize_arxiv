    "binary systems are among the best known sources of gravitational waves . specially interesting",
    "are the double neutron star systems ( nsns systems ) , the binaries formed by a neutron star and a black hole ( bhns systems ) and the binaries of black holes ( bhbh systems ) , because their emissions have a high probability of being detected in the near future .",
    "besides , it is well known that binaries lose energy and momentum via emission of gravitational waves , which cause reductions in their orbital distances , consequently increasing the orbital frequencies . moreover , for systems in circular orbits , the frequency of the emitted waves is twice the orbital frequency .",
    "the process continues until the systems reach the coalescing phase , where the systems leave the periodic regime and start the merging phase .    on the other hand ,",
    "concerning the study of the gravitational radiation itself , the stochastic backgrounds are of special interest .",
    "backgrounds can be generated when , for example , there is a superposition of signals of several sources , resulting in smooth - shaped spectra spanning a wide range of frequencies . in particular ,",
    "we are concerned in this paper with the backgrounds generated by a population of coalescing compact binaries formed from redshifts ranging from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 , i.e. , cosmological binaries .",
    "we can find in the literature some very interesting works on this issue , such as @xcite , where the authors calculated the backgrounds generated by coalescing nsns systems . generally speaking , they used monte carlo techniques to simulate the extragalactic population of compact binaries . besides , these authors considered the time evolution of the orbital frequency by using the  delay time \" ( that is , the interval of time between the formation and the coalescence of the systems ) in their calculations . in our method , we consider the time evolution in an explicit form , where the equation describing the evolution of the orbital frequency is taken at each instant of life of a given binary .    in zhu",
    "et al.@xcite , the authors consider the spectra generated by coalescing bhbh systems . in this paper , they assume average quantities for the energy emissions of single sources ; on the other hand , in our calculations we consider all the values for the orbital parameters a system can have , in the form of distribution functions .    still concerning the spectra generated by coalescing bhbh systems , marassi et al .",
    "@xcite adopted an updated version of the seba population synthesis code , in which the masses of the black holes range from @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    roughly speaking , the various papers cited above show results that are characterized by spectra with frequencies ranging from @xmath4hz and @xmath5hz and with maximum amplitudes located in the interval ranging from @xmath6hz to @xmath7hz . as shown below",
    ", the backgrounds we generated have similar forms to the ones we mentioned , though our results show , in general , higher amplitudes .",
    "this difference will be discussed timely .",
    "further , as it will be shown , our method has the very useful characteristic of being numerically simple , in the sense that it does not demand a heavy computational work .    in this paper",
    ", the spectra generated by the coalescing binaries will be calculated by means of@xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 represents the dimensionless amplitude of the spectrum , @xmath10 is the observed frequency , @xmath11 is the amplitude of the signals generated by each source and @xmath12 is the differential rate of generation of gravitational waves .",
    "it is worth pointing out that ( [ bg ] ) was deduced from an energy - flux relation .",
    "in fact , in a paper by de araujo et al.@xcite , the authors gave a detailed derivation of this equation , showing its robustness .",
    "actually , one can use ( [ bg ] ) in the calculation of different types of stochastic backgrounds , provided that one knows @xmath11 and the corresponding @xmath12 to the case one is dealing with .    here , @xmath11 has the form@xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the emitted frequency that , in this case , is the frequency emitted by a coalescing system ( note that @xmath14 and @xmath10 are related to each other by [ redshift ] ) , @xmath15 is the reduced mass and @xmath16 is the total mass .",
    "the differential rate @xmath12 in writing in following form    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the comoving volume element , @xmath19 is the redshift and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass distribution functions of the components of the systems . in fact , for neutron stars such distributions are given by dirac s delta functions , since we are considering that all these objects have the same mass of @xmath22 ; for black holes we use the function@xcite    @xmath23\\mbox{,}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is given in solar mass units .",
    "the term @xmath25 is known from cosmology , and the problem of determining @xmath12 comes down to the calculation of @xmath26 .    at this point , one could ask in what the present study differs from the previous ones .",
    "we will see that the main difference has to do with the application of a new method to calculate @xmath12 developed in our previous papers@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we show the main steps to obtain @xmath12 ; then , with ( [ bg ] ) , @xmath12 and ( [ source ] ) at hand , we calculate @xmath9 for the three families of compact binaries , which are explained in section [ sec3 ] ; in section [ sec4 ] we present the results and discuss , in particular , the detectability of the backgrounds studied here by the interferometric detectors laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) ( now evolved lisa ( elisa ) ) , big bang observer ( bbo ) , deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) , advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( aligo ) , einstein telescope ( et ) , and the cross - correlation of pairs of aligos and et ; finally , in section [ sec5 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we present here the main steps for the calculation of @xmath26 ( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we start by writing @xmath26 in the form    @xmath27    where the expression in the right - hand side is the formation rate of systems per comoving volume that reach the frequency @xmath14 at the instant @xmath28 ( see the derivation in appendix [ apena ] and also in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "also , @xmath29 refers to the instant of birth of the systems .    in ( [ dr2 ] ) , @xmath30 is the frequency distribution function of the binaries , which has the form ( we refer the reader to appendix [ apenb ] and ref.@xcite for the derivation of this equation ) :    @xmath31^{1/3}\\nu^{-11/3}\\nu_{0}^{2}\\mbox{exp}\\left[\\frac{-(r-\\bar{r})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right ] , \\label{dist2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the initial frequency ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants given in table [ tab2 ] ; and @xmath36 is the orbital distance , related to @xmath14 by means of kepler s third law .    on the other hand , @xmath37 is the binary formation rate density that , for nsns systems is given bys    @xmath38    here , @xmath39 refers to the redshift of birth of the systems , which is related to @xmath29 via the usual expression that can be found in any textbook of cosmology ; and @xmath40 is the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) .",
    "there are , in the literature , many different proposals to the sfrd , although they do not differ from each other very significantly . here",
    "we adopt , as a fiducial one , that given by springel and hernquist@xcite , namely    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and with @xmath45 fixing the normalization .",
    "besides , in ( [ bfrd ] ) , @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) is the mass fraction of stars that is converted into neutron stars , where @xmath47 is the fraction of binaries that survive to the second supernova event ; @xmath48 gives the fraction of massive binaries ( that is , those systems where both components can generate supernovae ) and @xmath49 is the mass fraction of progenitors that originates neutron stars , which , in the present case , is calculated by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the salpeter mass distribution@xcite with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "numerically , we have @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    now , considering ( [ bfrd ] ) , we can write ( [ dr2 ] ) in the form    @xmath57    where , following the notation adopted by zhu et al@xcite , @xmath58 is calculated by    @xmath59dt_{0}.\\ ] ]    in this context , following wu et al@xcite , @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the local coalescence rate and @xmath63 has the form    @xmath64_{z=0}dt_{0}.\\ ] ]    for bhns and bhbh systems , we have similar expressions , but with different values of @xmath37 .",
    "such values can be estimated by means of the results found in belczynski et al.@xcite , where these authors claim that the population of binaries is formed by @xmath65% of nsns , @xmath66% of bhbh and @xmath67% of bhns binaries .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be related to @xmath70 by means of these proportions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that belczynski et al.@xcite studied compact binaries with merger times lower than @xmath71yr ; that is , they considered coalescing binaries .",
    "basically , in the simulations they used , the binaries are formed through several different channels .",
    "specifically , nsns systems are formed through @xmath72 different channels , where there is a predominance of channels containing hypercritical accretion between a low - mass helium giant and its companion neutron star . on the other hand , bhns and bhbh systems",
    "are formed through just for and three channels , respectively , where there is a moderate predominance of mass transfer events .",
    "in this section , we present the calculations of the spectra generated by nsns , bhbh and bhns systems .",
    "although we are using ( [ bg ] ) for the three cases , the calculations are different for each family of binaries .",
    "therefore , we will show the calculations separately .",
    "neutron stars , according to theories of stellar evolution and observations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have characteristic masses that fall in a narrow interval around @xmath22 .",
    "so , in this paper we are considering that all neutron stars have masses of @xmath22 , which is a realistic choice , and at the same time , a simplification .",
    "one could ask how the results would be affected by the choice of the neutron star ( ns ) equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "since we are considering the coalescing phase , the results depend mainly on the mass of the nss .",
    "nsns systems are characterized by a specific coalescence frequency that , according to , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , may be considered as @xmath73hz for a pair of two @xmath22 nss .",
    "the choice of the eos is certainly important for the subsequent phase of evolution of the system , when the merger phase takes place .",
    "although there is just a value for the coalescence frequency , the spectrum will be spread over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "this behavior is due to the cosmic redshift , because systems emitting at the same frequency , but at different redshifts , will generate signals with different observed frequencies , obeying @xmath74 where , in this case , we are considering @xmath75hz .",
    "moreover , as we are considering that the redshift has the minimum and maximum values given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , the observed frequencies will have minimum and maximum values of @xmath78hz and @xmath79hz , respectively .",
    "since the masses of the components of the systems and their coalescing frequencies are the same , the spectra will only depend on the redshift @xmath19 .",
    "however , from ( [ redshift ] ) one notices that there will be just one value of @xmath10 for each value of @xmath19 , such that ( [ bg ] ) must be handled in a particular way .",
    "first , let us rewrite ( [ bg ] ) in the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the value of redshift corresponding to each observed frequency by means of ( [ redshift ] ) .",
    "now , in order to calculate ( [ coalnsns1 ] ) , @xmath12 can be written in the following form @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the value of the comoving volume at @xmath82 and @xmath85 is the dirac s delta function .",
    "therefore , substituting ( [ coalnsns2 ] ) in ( [ coalnsns1 ] ) and integrating , we have    @xmath86      the study of the coalescence of bhns systems is more complicated than the case of nsns systems , because the frequency of coalescence depends on the mass of the black hole .",
    "it is usually assumed that the coalescence occurs when the neutron star reaches the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the black hole .",
    "so , using kepler s third law and recalling that the emitted frequency is twice the orbital frequency , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the radius of the isco of the black hole , which is related to the schwarzschild radius , namely @xmath89 substituting ( [ schw ] ) in ( [ kepler ] ) we have @xmath90 since we are considering that black holes have masses in the interval",
    "@xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 , the emitted frequencies will have minimum and maximum values given by @xmath94hz and @xmath95hz , respectively .",
    "moreover , considering ( [ redshift ] ) and ( [ massbh ] ) , one notes that for each value of @xmath10 , one has continuous ranges of values for @xmath19 and @xmath96 .",
    "however , in the case of bhns systems , ( [ bg ] ) must be integrated over @xmath19 but not over @xmath96 , since these variables are not independent .",
    "moreover , for a given value of @xmath10 one needs to determine the maximum and minimum limits of integration , which are given by @xmath97 when @xmath98 or @xmath99 , we set @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . once the interval of integration is set , the variables @xmath96 and @xmath14 in the integral can be written as functions of @xmath19 by solving ( [ massbh ] ) and ( [ redshift ] ) .    in addition , note that in this case one needs to consider in the calculation of ( [ bg ] ) the distribution function given by ( [ blackhole ] ) .",
    "as a result , we have @xmath100      in this case , the frequency of coalescence depends on the values of the two components of the system .",
    "following marassi et al.@xcite , @xmath14 is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the symmetric mass ratio and @xmath16 is the total mass .",
    "the polynomial coefficients are @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . according to ( [ bhbh1 ] ) , for each value of @xmath14",
    ", there will be a continuous set of pairs of values for @xmath106 and @xmath107 that satisfies this equation .",
    "moreover , the masses are not independent , in fact they are related to each other by ( [ bhbh1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we should integrate over one of the masses ( or one parameter which describes both masses . )",
    "however , it is not possible to solve ( [ bhbh1 ] ) analytically , i.e , to write the masses as functions of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we need to use approximations . first , consider that @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( which we refer as to @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) are related to each other by @xmath110 where the variable @xmath111 is greater than or equal to one . substituting ( [ bhbh2 ] ) in ( [ bhbh1 ] ) we can write the masses @xmath108 and @xmath109 as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath111 , namely @xmath112\\\\\\nonumber m_{2}&=&\\frac{c^{3}}{g}\\frac{1}{\\pi \\nu}\\left[\\frac{a_{0}k^{2}}{(1+k)^{5}}+\\frac{b_{0}k}{(1+k)^{5}}+\\frac{c_{0}}{1+k}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a suitable approximation for ( [ bhbh1 ] ) is given by @xmath113 since @xmath114 for all values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "considering that @xmath115 , we use ( [ bhbh4 ] ) in order to estimate a first value for @xmath108 ; next , we take this pair of values for the masses and calculate a first value for @xmath116 ; we then correct the value for @xmath108 using @xmath117 with this new value of @xmath108 , we repeat the above process : we calculate @xmath116 again and use ( [ bhbh5 ] ) , bearing in mind that this process may be performed an arbitrary number of times in order to yield more accurate values for @xmath108 . in the cases where we have @xmath118 at the end of the process , we consider @xmath119 and perform an analogous process to find out @xmath109 .    with the pair @xmath120 at hand ,",
    "we calculate the maximum value of @xmath111 : @xmath121    thus , in order to cover all possible values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we consider that @xmath111 , in ( [ bhbh3 ] ) , ranges form one to @xmath122 .    finally , ( [ bg ] ) can be written as follow @xmath123",
    "as usual , in the literature , we represent the backgrounds in terms of the strain amplitude @xmath124 , which is given by    @xmath125    and also in terms of the energy density parameter @xmath126 , which reads ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath127    the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath124 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "note that these spectra are mainly compared to the sensitivity curves of et@xcite and aligo@xcite , since the spectra are in their frequency bands .",
    "the sensitivity curves of the proposed space - based antennas lisa , elisa@xcite , bbo@xcite , decigo@xcite are also shown , but given their frequency bands they can not detect the spectra studied here .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one notices that the background generated by the three families of compact binaries are below the sensitivity curves of the interferometric detectors . besides , one notices that the background generated by the bhns systems have higher amplitudes when compared to the ones generated by nsns and bhbh systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum corresponding to bhbh systems has the lowest amplitudes .",
    "since our calculations depend on some parameters and functions , it is worth investigating how our results are affected by different choices of these quantities .",
    "first , let us consider the masses of the components : in ( [ source ] ) , if we multiply both masses by a factor of @xmath128 , @xmath11 will be multiplied by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "important variations in the amplitudes would occur only if @xmath130 or @xmath131 .    from ( [ bg ] ) , ( [ bfrd ] ) and ( [ strain ] ) ,",
    "one notices that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , if ones multiply @xmath40 or @xmath60 by , say , a factor of @xmath134 , the amplitudes shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] will increase by a factor of @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , for realistic scenarios , different choices for @xmath40 and @xmath60 would have small effects on the amplitudes of the backgrounds .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with similar studies found in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , one sees a good agreement concerning the shapes of the spectra , although our results show higher amplitudes .",
    "for example , in @xcite one sees that @xmath136 at @xmath137hz for the backgrounds generated by nsns systems , while for our corresponding spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have @xmath138 at the same frequency .    comparing our results for bhbh systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with the results found in @xcite , one can note some similarities : the amplitudes increase until a maximum value in the range @xmath139hz and then they have a sharp decrease . concerning the amplitudes , we have a maximum value of @xmath140 , while in zhu et al the value is @xmath141 .",
    "marassi et al @xcite also study backgrounds generated by bhbh binaries .",
    "these authors discussed different models , and the resulting spectra present maximum amplitudes ranging from @xmath142 for a frequency band around @xmath143hz .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , generally speaking , the spectra is model dependent .",
    "therefore , different assumptions lead to different backgrounds . in ref.@xcite , for example , the population of binaries is such that the maximum probability of coalescence is around @xmath144 . therefore , for @xmath145 there is a relatively small proportion of coalescing systems emitting ; in our calculations we do not consider such a behavior .",
    "this difference in the proportion of systems at lower redshifts could explain our higher amplitudes as compared to the ones of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the spectra ( signals ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are below the sensitivity curves of the detectors , it could well be possible detect them by correlating the outputs of two or more detectores . for the correlation of two interferometers , the detectability of a given signal can be quantified by means of the so called signal - to - noise ratio ( s@xmath146n ) , namely @xcite :    @xmath147,\\ ] ]    where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the spectral noise densities , @xmath150 is the integration time , and @xmath151 is the overlap reduction function , which depends on the relative positions , spatial orientation , and distances of the detectors ; and @xmath126 is given by ( [ omega ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] one can see the s@xmath146n for the three families of compact binaries , in particular for pairs of aligos and et .",
    "lll system & aligo & et + nsns & @xmath152 & @xmath153 + bhns & @xmath154 & @xmath155 + bhbh & @xmath156 & @xmath157 +    from table  [ tab1 ] , one notices that et could in principle detect the backgrounds where the spectrum generated by bhns systems would have higher probability of detection ; for pairs of aligos , the low values of the s@xmath146n ratio indicate a non detection .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by coalescing compact binaries , using a new method developed in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "we show that , of the three spectra considered in this paper , the one generated by bhns systems has the highest amplitudes , while the background by bhbh systems show the lowest amplitudes . moreover , one notices slight differences in the forms of the spectra , which are due to the different methods used to calculate them by means of ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "we found that the backgrounds calculated here would not be detected by the interferometric detectors such as ligo and et , although thanks to the cross - correlation of signals et could , in principle , detect such signals .",
    "particularly , we found that the spectrum generated by bhns systems have the highest s@xmath146n ratio , while the one corresponding to bhbh systems presents the lowest s@xmath146n .",
    "concerning the dependence of our results on the parameters used in the calculations , we found that the masses of the components of the binaries , as well as @xmath40 and @xmath60 , do not strongly influence the backgrounds . besides , a particular choice for the ns eos does not affect the results either .",
    "we compared the spectra studied here with some interesting results found in the literature .",
    "one notices similarities in their shapes , namely : maximum frequencies of @xmath5hz and maximum amplitudes in the range @xmath158hz . roughly speaking ,",
    "these characteristics are common to the three families of binaries .    on the other hand ,",
    "our amplitudes given in terms of @xmath159 are in general higher than the ones found in the literature by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "we concluded that such a difference is mainly due to population characteristics assumed .",
    "therefore , generally speaking , the spectra is model dependents .",
    "efde would like to thank capes for support and jcna would like to thank fapesp and cnpq for partial support .",
    "finally , we thank the referee for the careful reading of the paper , the criticisms , and the very useful suggestions which greatly improved our paper .",
    "in this appendix , we present the main steps of the derivation of @xmath26 . for further details ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath26 by means of an analogy with a problem of statistical mechanics . in this problem ,",
    "the aim is to calculate the number of particles that reach a given area @xmath160 in a time interval @xmath161 , i.e. , the objective is to calculate the flux @xmath162 of particles .",
    "basically , this flux is calculated by counting the particles inside the volume @xmath163 , adjacent to the area @xmath160 , that are moving towards @xmath160 with velocity @xmath164 , where @xmath165 obeys a distribution function @xmath166 .",
    "hence , the flux is obtained by integrating over all the positive values of @xmath165 .    with some modifications ,",
    "this method can be used to determine @xmath26 .",
    "first , we substituted the spatial coordinate @xmath167 by the frequency @xmath14 and the velocity @xmath165 by the time variation of the frequency , which is defined by @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the number of systems in the interval @xmath169 adjacent to a particular frequency @xmath14 is given by        considering that the distribution @xmath172 gives the number of systems which have @xmath173 in the interval @xmath174 , the number of systems in @xmath169 and with values of @xmath173 in the interval @xmath174 is given by                                    notice that the denominator of the term between parenthesis in ( [ back2 ] ) is the total number of systems .",
    "now , using the function given by ( [ xi ] ) and changing the differential @xmath169 by means of the chain rule , ( [ dmu ] ) assumes the form                            where @xmath204 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the masses of the components of the system and @xmath205 is the initial frequency .",
    "so , carrying out a change of variables via @xmath206 , where @xmath205 was associated with the variable @xmath202 in @xmath207 , one has      finally , it would be necessary to perform a further coordinate transformation in order to write @xmath209 as a function of the emitted frequency @xmath14 .",
    "such a transformation , calculated by means of @xmath210 , is trivial . besides",
    ", @xmath36 is written as a function of @xmath202 by means of kepler s third law ."
