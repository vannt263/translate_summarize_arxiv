    "the non - mesonic weak decay ( nmwd ) process of a @xmath11 hypernucleus , @xmath12 , gives a unique opportunity to study the weak interaction between baryons since this strangeness non - conserving process is purely attributed to the weak interaction . in the nmwd , there are two decay channels , @xmath13 @xmath14 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath15 @xmath16 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the ratio of those decay widths , @xmath7/@xmath9 , is an important observable used to study the isospin structure of the nmwd mechanism . for the past 40 years",
    ", there has been a longstanding puzzle that the experimental @xmath7/@xmath9 ratio disagrees with that of theoretical calculations based on the most natural and simplest model , the one - pion exchange model ( ope ) . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath12 reaction is expressed as a pion absorption process after the @xmath17 decay inside the nucleus .",
    "since the ope process is tensor - dominant and the tensor transition of the initial @xmath18 pair in the @xmath19-state requires the final @xmath20 pair to have isospin zero , the @xmath21 ratio in the ope process becomes close to 0 .",
    "however , previous experimental results have indicated a large @xmath21 ratio ( @xmath221 ) @xcite .",
    "this large discrepancy between the ope - model predictions and the experimental results has stimulated many theoretical studies : the heavy meson exchange model , the direct quark model and the two - nucleon ( 2@xmath23 ) induced model ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "after k. sasaki @xmath25 pointed out an error in the sign of the kaon exchange amplitudes in 2000 @xcite , those theoretical values of the @xmath21 ratio have increased to the level of 0.4@xmath220.7 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental data still have large errors ( @xmath21 = 0.93 @xmath26 0.55 for @xmath0he @xcite ) , and it is hard to draw a definite conclusion on the @xmath21 ratio .",
    "when we compare the measured @xmath21 ratio with that obtained in theoretical calculations , the most serious technical problem was a treatment of the re - scattering effect in the residual nucleus , the so - called final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "moreover , the possible existence of a multi - nucleon induced process has been discussed theoretically ( such as 2@xmath23-induced process ) , though there has been no experimental evidence .",
    "several nucleon energy spectra from hypernuclear decay have been reported so far @xcite , in which it is however difficult to extract the @xmath21 ratio without theoretical assumptions on the effects of fsi and possible multi - nucleon induced processes .",
    "since the 1@xmath23-induced decay `` @xmath27 '' is two - body process , the outgoing nucleon - nucleon pair suffering no fsi effect must have about 180 degree opening angle and clear energy correlation . in the present experiment , we performed a coincident measurement of the two nucleons , @xmath4 and @xmath5-pairs , in the decay for the first time .",
    "the 1@xmath23-induced processes could be clearly observed by measuring yields of the back - to - back @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs and confirming that the energy sums roughly correspond to their @xmath28-values ( @xmath22150 mev ) .",
    "the measured yields of the coincident back - to - back @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs , @xmath29 , are represented as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are the number of back - to - back @xmath4(@xmath5)-pair events from the decay ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for decay - counter acceptances and detection efficiencies and reduction factors ( due to the fsi or / and other non back - to - back processes ) for the @xmath4(@xmath5)-pair , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that the reduction factors are approximately canceled out with assumption of the charge symmetry , @xmath35 , when we take the ratio of the @xmath4- and @xmath5-pair yields , @xmath6 .    in order to minimize the fsi effect , we selected a light @xmath19-shell hypernucleus , @xmath0he",
    ". in @xmath19-shell hypernucleus , initial relative @xmath18 states must be @xmath36 states , whereas in a @xmath37-shell hypernucleus they may be @xmath38 states . to investigate the @xmath37-wave effect",
    ", we also performed the same experiment for a typical light @xmath37-shell hypernucleus , @xmath1c .    in this letter",
    ", we show the opening angle and the energy sum distributions of @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs from the nmwd of @xmath0he and the @xmath39 ratio for both hypernuclei .",
    "the present experiments ( kek - ps e462/e508 ) were carried out at the 12-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) in the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "hypernuclei , @xmath0he and @xmath1c , were produced via the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at 1.05 gev/@xmath40 on @xmath41li and @xmath42c targets , respectively .",
    "since the ground state of @xmath43li is above the threshold of @xmath0he @xmath44 , it promptly decays into @xmath0he emitting a low - energy proton .",
    "the @xmath45li ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) @xmath43li reaction was therefore employed to produce @xmath0he .",
    "the hypernuclear mass spectra were calculated by reconstructing the momenta of incoming @xmath2 and outgoing @xmath3 using a beam - line spectrometer composed of the qqdqq system and the superconducting kaon spectrometer ( sks ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "particles emitted from the decays of @xmath11 hypernuclei were detected by the decay - particle detection system installed symmetrically in the direction to the target in order to maximize acceptance of the back - to - back event for @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs from the nmwd process , as shown in ref.@xcite ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it was composed of plastic scintillation counters and multi - wire drift chambers .",
    "the decay particles were identified by the time - of - flight and the range .",
    "r0.65        the ground state yields of @xmath0he and @xmath1c are , respectively , about 4.6 @xmath46 10@xmath47 and 6.2 @xmath46 10@xmath47 events , which were one order - of - magnitude higher than those of previous experiments .",
    "the inclusive excitation - energy spectra of @xmath43li and @xmath1c are shown in ref.@xcite ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "upper figures of fig .",
    "[ coinfig ] , ( a ) and ( b ) , show opening angle distributions of @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs at the energy threshold level of 30 mev for both of proton and neutron .",
    "they seem to have clear back - to - back correlations , though these are not corrected the angular dependent acceptance .",
    "the shaded histogram shows estimated nucleon contaminations due to the pion absorption process in which @xmath48 s from the mesonic decay of @xmath11 hypernucleus are absorbed by the materials around the target .",
    "the background was estimated by assuming that the shape of the angular distribution from this @xmath48 absorption process is the same as that from the @xmath48 decay of @xmath11 ( @xmath11 @xmath49 ) formed via the quasi - free formation process ( see ref.@xcite for the detail ) .",
    "the angular distributions of middle of fig .",
    "[ coinfig ] , ( c ) and ( d ) , are corrected for acceptances and efficiencies for @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs , and normalized per nmwd . the estimated contamination due to",
    "the pion absorption stated above are subtracted .",
    "they still have back - to - back correlation , which indicates that the fsi effect is not so severe and 1@xmath23-induced nmwd ( two body process ) is the major one .",
    "lower figures of fig .",
    "[ coinfig ] , ( e ) and ( f ) , show energy sum distributions of the @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs by gating back - to - back events as shown in the upper figures ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we confirmed that those energy sum distributions have broad peak around these @xmath28-values as expected .",
    "the shaded histogram shows estimated contaminations due to pion absorption as described above , which distributes to lower energy region .",
    "also for @xmath1c , similar distributions of the angle and energy sum of the @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs were obtained in a same way .",
    "we successfully observed @xmath4- and @xmath5-pairs from the nmwd of @xmath0he and @xmath1c .",
    "the ratio of the back - to - back @xmath4- and @xmath5-pair yields , @xmath51 , for @xmath0he and @xmath1c were obtained as @xmath52 where the quoted systematic errors mainly come from the neutron detection efficiency ( @xmath22 6 % ) .",
    "they can be approximately regarded as the @xmath21 with assumption of the charge symmetry .",
    "it is now revealed that the @xmath21 ratio is significantly less than unity , thus excluding the earlier claim that the ratio is close to unity @xcite . on the contrary , recent theoretical calculations seem to be supportive to our results being on the increase of the ratio toward 0.5 .",
    "the present results have finally given the answer to the longstanding @xmath21 ratio puzzle , and have made a significant contribution to the study of the nmwd ."
