    "narrow - line region ( nlr ) structure is one of the most interesting aspects of seyfert galaxies and , consequently , has been long studied .",
    "one tool in such investigations is an emission - line profile .",
    "a blueward asymmetry in narrow - line profiles is frequently observed in seyfert galaxies , and this has led to two traditional interpretations : an outflow model including extinction between line - emitting clouds , and an inflow model in which extinction originates in individual clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in some seyfert galaxies , emission lines with higher critical electron density and/or higher ionization potential have lower central velocities and/or wider line widths .",
    "these features have been interpreted as implying that , in the nlr , velocity decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus , and that the regions closer to the nucleus are denser and in a higher excitation state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  1068 is one of the most famous seyfert galaxies and has been studied extensively .",
    "the distance to ngc  1068 is 14.4 mpc ( corresponds to 70 pc . ) and its systemic velocity is 1148 km  s@xmath3 @xcite . although ngc  1068 has been considered a prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy , its forbidden lines are much wider than those of typical seyfert 2 galaxies , and the emission - line profiles show multiple components @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested outflow in the nlr of ngc  1068 , and @xcite and @xcite argued that the velocity field of the nlr can be explained as a biconical outflow , based on tri - dimensional spectroscopic studies .",

    "( _ hst _ ) revealed that the striking velocity structure of the nlr gradually increased with radius ( crenshaw & kraemer 2000 , hereafter ) .",
    "it must be noted that such a velocity field differs from the classical perspective , which states that higher velocity components lie closer to the nucleus .",
    "the velocity field was shown to be reproducible with a hollowed biconical outflow model ( @xcite ; ) , but the radial dependence of the velocity in the model was included without a physical rationale . @xcite and @xcite attempted to explain the radial dependence of the velocity , but no successful explanation has been suggested to date .",
