    "this kind of hidden symmetry is a discrete antiunitary symmetry with a composite operator consisting of translation , complex conjugation , and sublattice exchange .",
    "a natural question is whether there exist topological insulators protected by such kind of hidden symmetry . in this paper , we give a positive answer for this question and develop a new kind of topological insulators protected by such hidden symmetry .",
    "the development of optical lattice and cold atom techniques provide versatile models , especially , some of which are hardly realized in solid real materials .",
    "therefore , cold atoms in optical lattices become a platform to investigate and explore various kinds of topological phases , especially those that are difficult to be realized in the real materials . in recent years",
