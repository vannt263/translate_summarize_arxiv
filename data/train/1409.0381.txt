    "geometric optics is a physical theory in which the propagation of light is described in terms of _ light rays_. in this theory , the physical space in which we live and in which the light propagates is treated , once a unit of lenghth is chosen , as a three - dimensional euclidean affine space @xmath0 . in a transparent homogeneous medium occupying the whole physical space @xmath0 , a light ray is described by an oriented straight line drawn in that space .",
    "when the transparent medium occupies only a part of @xmath0 , a light ray , as long as it is contained in that medium , is described by an oriented segment of a straight line , but it will be convenient to consider the full oriented straight line which supports that segment .",
    "reflections on smooth reflecting surfaces , or refractions through smooth surfaces separating two transparent media with different refractive indices , which transform an incident light ray into the corresponding reflected or refracted light ray , therefore appear as transformations , defined on a part of the set @xmath1 of all oriented straight lines in @xmath0 , with values in @xmath1 .",
    "the set @xmath1 of all possible oriented straight lines drawn in the three - dimensional euclidean affine space @xmath0 depends on four parameters : an oriented line @xmath2 being given , two parameters are needed to specify the unit vector @xmath3 parallel to and of the same orientation as @xmath4 , and two more parameters , for example the coordinates of its intersection point with a transverse fixed plane , are needed to specify the position of @xmath4",
    ". we will prove below that @xmath1 has the structure of a smooth four - dimensional symplectic manifold - dimensional euclidean affine space is a @xmath5-dimensional symplectic manifold . ] .",
    "very often in geometrical optics one deals with the propagation of light rays which make a sub - family of the family of all possible light rays , smoothly depending on a number of parameters smaller than 4 . for example , the family of light rays emitted by a luminous point in all possible directions , or the family of light rays emitted by a smooth luminous surface , each ray being emitted in the direction orthogonal to the surface , smoothly depend on @xmath6 parameters .",
    "let us state two definitions .",
    "[ definitionrank ] the _ rank _ of a family of rays which smoothly depend on a finite number of parameters is the number of these parameters .",
    "[ normalfamily ] a rank 2 family of rays is said to be _ normal _ if at each point of the lighted part of the physical space @xmath0 there exists a small piece of smooth surface orhtogonal to all the rays which meet it .    in @xcite ,",
    "hamilton uses a slightly different terminology : he calls _",
    "class _ the rank of a system of rays and _ orthogonal system _ a normal system of rays .",
    "in an homogeneous and isotropic medium , the family of light rays emitted by a luminous point is a normal family : the spheres centered on the luminous point are indeed orthogonal to all rays .",
    "the family of rays emitted by a smooth luminous surface which , at each of its point , emits a ray in the direction orthogonal to the surface , too is a normal family : it is indeed a well known geometric property of the straight lines orthogonal to a smooth surface .",
    "malus theorem states that a rank 2 normal family of rays which propagates through an optical system made of any number of homogeneous and isotropic transparent media , with any number of smooth reflecting or refracting surfaces , always remains normal , in each of the media through which it propagates .    after a short presentation of its historical backgroud in section [ history ]",
    ", we give a direct proof of malus theorem which rests on symplectic geometry .",
    "we show in section [ symplecticstructure ] that the set @xmath1 of all oriented straight lines in the euclidean affine space @xmath0 is a smooth @xmath7-dimensional manifold , naturally endowed with a symplectic @xmath6-form @xmath8.this symplectic form is the pull - back , by a diffeomorphism of @xmath1 onto the cotangent bundle @xmath9 to a two - dimensional sphere @xmath10 , of the canonical symplectic form on that cotangent bundle .",
    "that diffeomorphism of @xmath1 onto @xmath9 is not uniquely determined : it depends on the choice of a reference point in @xmath0 ; but the symplectic form @xmath8 does not depend on that choice . in section [ reflectionrefraction ]",
    "we prove that reflection on a smooth surface is a symplectic diffeomorphism of one open subset of the symplectic manifold @xmath11 ( made by light rays which hit the mirror on its reflecting side ) onto another open subset of that manifold .",
    "similarly , we prove that refraction through a smooth surface which separates two transparent media of refractive indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a symplectic diffeomorphism of one subset of @xmath1 endowed with the symplectic form @xmath14 onto another open subset of that space endowed with the symplectic form @xmath15 . in section [ normallagrangian ]",
    "we prove that a rank 2 family of rays is normal if and only if it is a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] : since a symplectic diffeomorphism maps lagrangian submanifolds onto lagrangian submanifolds , malus theorem immediately follows from the results obtained in previous sections .    for much more elaborate applications of symplectic geometry in optics ,",

    "tienne louis malus ( 17751812 ) is a french scientist who investigated geometric properties of families of straight oriented lines , in view of applications to light rays .",
    "he developed huygens undulatory theory of light , discovered and investigated the phenomenon of _ polarization of light _ and the phenomenon of _",
    "double refraction _ of light in crystals .",
    "he participated in napoleon s disastrous expedition to egypt ( 17981801 ) where he contracted diseases probably responsible for his early death .",
    "he proved @xcite that the family of rays emitted by a luminous point source ( which , as we have seen above , is normal ) remains normal after _",
    "one reflection _ on a smooth surface , or _",
    "one refraction _ through a smooth surface",
    "but he was not sure @xcite whether this property remains true for _ several _ reflections or refractions  .",
    "his works on families of oriented straight lines were later used and enhanced by hamilton .    for reflections ,",
    "a very simple geometric proof of malus theorem was obtained by the french scientist charles dupin @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in french optics manuals @xcite , malus theorem is frequently called malus - dupin s theorem . according to @xcite ,",
    "quetelet and gergonne gave a full proof of malus theorem for refractions in 1825 .",
    "independently , the great irish mathematician william rowan hamilton ( 18051865 ) gave a proof of this theorem , both for reflections and for refractions , in his famous paper @xcite .",
    "his proof rests on the stationarity properties of the optical length of rays , with respect to infinitesimal displacements of the points of reflections or of refractions , on the reflecting or refracting surfaces .",
    "charles franois dupin ( 17841873 ) is a french mathematician and naval engineer .",
    "several mathematical objects in differential geometry bear his name : _ dupin cyclids _",
    "( remarkable surfaces he discovered when he was a young student at the french cole polytechnique ) , _ dupin indicatrix _ ( which describes the local shape of a surface ) .",
    "it is said in wikipedia @xcite that he inspired to the poet and novelist edgar allan poe ( 18091849 ) the figure of _ auguste dupin _ appearing in the three detective stories : _ the murders in the rue morgue _ , _ the mystery of marie roget _ and _ the purloined letter_.",
    "the set @xmath1 of all possible oriented straight lines in the affine @xmath16-dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 has a natural structure of smooth @xmath7-dimensional manifold , is endowed with a symplectic form @xmath8 and is diffeomorphic , by a symplectic diffeomorphism , to the cotangent bundle @xmath9 to a 2-dimensional sphere @xmath10 .",
    "let indeed @xmath10 be a sphere of any fixed radius @xmath17 ( for example @xmath18 ) centered on a point @xmath19 and @xmath20 be another fixed point in @xmath0 . of course we can take @xmath21 , but for clarity it is better to separate these two points .",

    "the above described 11 correspondence between the set @xmath1 of all oriented straight lines and the cotangent bundle @xmath9 allows us to transport on @xmath1 the differentiable manifold structure , the liouville one form @xmath36 and the symplectic form @xmath37 .",
