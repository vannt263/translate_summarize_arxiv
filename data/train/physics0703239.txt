    "ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) have velocities below 10  m / s and wavelengths around 1000   .",
    "they are totally reflected under each angle of incidence from certain materials and hence storable for hundreds of seconds in volumina made of those materials .",
    "this remarkable feature has put ucn in a favorite role to investigate fundamental properties of the neutron like its lifetime @xcite , its electric dipole moment @xcite , or its quantum states in the earth s gravitational field @xcite .",
    "+ ucn are guided in reflective tubes from the source to the experiment .",
    "the roughness of the guide surface is crucial for its transport properties . on rough surfaces ,",
    "neutrons are non - specular reflected , resulting in a diffusive transport .",
    "therefore the number of reflections for a neutron to travel a given distance decreases compared to a smooth surface with specular reflection and the transmission of the guide will be reduced significantly . to overcome this loss ,",
    "essential r&d work on ucn guide properties is carried out at many laboratories @xcite .",
    "+ the ucn guides we report on are made of a metallic surface with a high fermi potential - natural nickel - whose high neutron - optical quality is achieved in a replication process first used for ucn application some 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "the technique has been revisited by the sputter - dnnschicht company in heidelberg ( s  dh ) .",
    "the coherent interaction of neutrons with a surface is described by the fermi - potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the nuclear properties of the surface atoms seen by the neutrons @xcite .",
    "the real part of the potential @xmath1 sets a critical velocity @xmath3 , with the neutron mass @xmath4 .",
    "neutrons with a normal velocity component @xmath5 are totally reflected from the surface with a probability given by the reflectivity coefficient    the dimensionless ratio is called the energy - independent wall - loss probability per bounce .",
    "it describes the ucn losses on the surface material due to absorption and inelastic scattering .",
    "+ nickel is commonly used as guide material due to its high fermi - potential of @xmath1=252  nev , which corresponds to a critical velocity .",
    "for ucn with velocities close to the critical velocity @xmath6 , the reflectivity decreases rapidly .",
    "however , sufficiently below @xmath6 the reflectivity remains higher than 99.9  % .",
    "+ such a high reflectivity would allow nearly loss - free ucn transportation if only some hundreds of reflections over typical distances of meters to the experiment are needed as it is the case for specular transport .",
    "this is no longer true , however , if non - specular reflections come into play . in first order ,",
    "the probability for diffusive reflection of a wave on a rough surface is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average surface roughness and @xmath9 the normal wavelength component .",
    "therefore , for low loss transportation of ucn , the surface roughness has to be smaller than 50    to avoid diffusive loss rates exceeding those from absorption and inelastic scattering .",
    "at the ucn facility pf2 @xcite of the institut laue langevin ( ill ) , very cold neutrons are extracted vertically from the liquid d@xmath10 source of the high - flux reactor towards the so - called steyerl - turbine , where they are doppler - shifted to the ucn regime .",
    "the cryogenic vertical guide , the curved feeding guide , the turbine blades and the following exit guides are made of nickel on an all - metal basis . a detailed description is given in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this so - called replika technique is to copy the surface quality of a glass substrate to the guide surface .",
    "these metal guides offer high mechanical flexibility and stability and withstand the high radiation level close to the reactor core . + the revisited replika plates were manufactured at in the following way : 2000    nickel was sputtered onto borofloat glass , gently solved , and then glued up - side - down onto an aluminum plate as mechanical support .",
    "the dimensions of the plates are @xmath11 .",
    "the roughness was measured using x - rays to be less than 10    over the whole surface .",
    "to measure the neutron reflectivity of such replika plates , two of them are installed as a neutron guide of length @xmath12 with open sides , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "two collimators c1 and c2 , made of cadmium , define a mean angle @xmath13 , under which ucn can enter the guide . the upper plate is fixed , while the lower one is vertically movable .",
    "the distance @xmath14 between the plates is adjustable by means of micrometer - screws ( mms ) with a reproducibility @xmath15 .",
    "ucn have to undergo many specular reflections before being counted in the detector .",
    "those ucn , which leave the horizontal parallel plate system to its open sides , are immediately absorbed to avoid reentering .",
    "a monitor in front of the guide monitors the flux of the incoming ucn .",
    "gaseous detectors with low @xmath16he admixtures are used .",
    "count rates were around 0.3  cps and 1  cps for the detector and the monitor , respectively .",
    "+ the average ucn velocity at the tes position of the pf2 facility is @xmath178  m / s .",
    "+ the background of the detector was measured by a ) putting an ucn absorber between the plates and by b ) closing the diaphragm c3 towards the detector completely .",
    "both measurements yield a similar background rate around @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the background mainly arises from thermal reactor neutrons which can penetrate the detector shielding .",
    "the background rate of the monitor was found to be negligible .",
    "normalized counts @xmath19 as a function of the distance between the plates . the indicated number of collisions are calculated for the mean angle of incidence @xmath20    fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] shows the counts @xmath19 of the detector after background correction and normalization to the monitor data .",
    "@xmath19 decreases with smaller distances between the plates as expected : for smaller distances the number of specular reflections increases , according to @xmath21 , while the detection probability decreases with @xmath22 . + the ratio of two measured @xmath19 values at different distances @xmath14 can be expressed by : @xmath23 the term on the right hand side is calculated numerically as a function of the reflectivity @xmath24 and is compared to the measured count ratios .",
    "an isotropic ucn distribution between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is assumed .",
    "it was shown , that the results do not depend strongly on the form of the input distribution as only the difference in the number of reflections enters .",
    "+ by evaluating the different combinations of the measured distances @xmath14 we obtain a reflectivity of at least 99.9(1)% .",
    "the loss probability per bounce therefore is smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "all - metal guides produced by a replication process have shown their potential during more than 20 years of use at the ucn / vcn facility pf2 of the ill .",
    "they offer high optical performance for both vcn and ucn , are resistant against high radiation and due to their thinness they are of high mechanical flexibility . + the revisited replika technique yields guides with a surface roughness @xmath28   .",
    "their reflectivity for ucn under realistic experimental conditions was measured to be at least 99.9(1 )  % per bounce , close to the theoretical expectations . with this technique ,",
    "ucn guides of several meters length for new ucn sources , but also upgrades of existing guide systems , can be produced .",
