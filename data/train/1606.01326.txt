    "beryllium is used as a surface material in the jet project  @xcite and for the plasma - facing walls in iter  @xcite .",
    "this calls for accurate scattering data , as evidenced by recent coordinated research projects and technical meetings organized on this topic by the international atomic energy agency  @xcite .",
    "beryllium is among the most reactive elements , and its high chemical activity as well as its toxicity make it virtually impossible to obtain reliable values of the electron - impact cross sections from direct measurements with traditional setups .    due to the lack of experimental data , researchers in plasma modeling currently have to rely entirely on theoretical predictions .",
    "for this reason , it is important to estimate the accuracy of the available theoretical data .",
    "extensive calculations utilizing state - of - the - art computational methods , such as @xmath2-matrix with pseudostates ( rmps )  @xcite , convergent close - coupling ( ccc )  @xcite , and time - dependent close - coupling ( tdcc )  @xcite , were performed already more than a decade ago .",
    "all these calculations indicate a slow convergence of the close - coupling expansion for certain transitions and significant effects originating from coupling to the target continuum . due to the importance of the collision system ,",
    "the topic remains under active investigation , with the most recent ccc predictions published in 2015  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an extensive and complete ( for most modeling applications ) set of electron scattering data for neutral beryllium , including elastic scattering , momentum transfer , excitation , and ionization from the ground state as well as a number of excited states , including the metastable @xmath0 state , which is of particular importance for collisional radiative models .",
    "the calculations reported below were carried out with the ( close - coupling ) code  @xcite . as an independent check on these predictions",
    ", we also performed ccc calculations containing a large number of pseudostates in the close - coupling expansion .",
    "good agreement between these independent calculations should provide additional confidence in the accuracy of the obtained cross sections while any discrepancy would allow to identify a possible source of a problem .",
    "the distinct feature of the bsr approach is its ability to employ term - dependent nonorthogonal orbitals in the description of the target states .",
    "this allows us to optimize individual atomic wave functions independently and thereby generate an accurate description of the target states with relatively few configurations . over the past decade ,",
    "the bsr code ( along with its relativistic extension , dbsr  @xcite ) has been successfully applied to a number of targets , including those with multiple open shells  @xcite .",
    "compared to some of those more complex systems , neutral beryllium is relatively simple , in particular if only single - electron excitations from the @xmath3 filled outer subshell are considered . for practical applications , this simplicity offers the advantage of allowing for cross checks between the predictions from several highly sophisticated methods , as done with bsr and ccc calculations presented here , rather than having to rely on just a single approach .    in general",
    ", it is very helpful to investigate electron - atom collision systems with different computational approaches , particularly when high accuracy is required in applications .",
    "previous examples include , but are not limited to , e - be@xmath4  @xcite , e - be@xmath5  @xcite , and e - li  @xcite . for quasi two - electron targets , as considered here , the complexity of the electron - collision problem is such that substantial discrepancies may occur .",
    "this was recently highlighted for the e - mg and e - al@xmath4 collision systems  @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : after discussing the description of the target structure , we summarize the most important aspects of the collision calculations . this",
    "is followed by a presentation of the cross sections for the most important transitions , starting with elastic scattering from be in its ground state .",
    "comparison of the results from the present bsr and ccc calculations with those from previous rmps calculations , as well as a systematic study of the effects of increasing channel coupling on the predictions , provides a basis for estimating the accuracy of the present dataset .",
    "the target states of beryllium in the present calculations were generated by combining the multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) and the box - based close - coupling methods  @xcite .",
    "we tried to account for the principal correlation effects , while bearing in mind that the final multi - configuration expansions still needed to be dealt with in the subsequent collision calculation with one more electron to be coupled in .",
    "since relativistic effects are small in beryllium , certainly when it comes to their effect on electron collisions in practice , we used the nonrelativistic @xmath6-coupling approximation , with the structure of the multi - channel target expansion chosen as @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the wave function of the outer valence electron , while the @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions stand for the configuration interaction ( ci ) expansions of the corresponding ionic and specific atomic states , respectively .",
    "these expansions were generated in separate mchf calculations for each state using the mchf program  @xcite .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq : expn ] ) can be considered as a model for the entire @xmath11 and @xmath12 rydberg series of the beryllium spectrum , including autoionizing states and continuum pseudostates .",
    "the most correlated @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 states require more accurate descriptions .",
    "these states were represented by separate mchf expansions , with the orbitals specifically optimized for each given term .",
    "although abbreviated as @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsr - ci ] ) , the particular expansions for these states include all single and double excitations from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) correlated orbitals .    a more extensive description of core - valence correlation would require additional ionic states by opening the @xmath21 shell . their inclusion , however , would have considerably increased the target expansions and made them no longer tractable in the subsequent scattering calculations .",
    "the unknown functions @xmath8 for the outer valence electron were expanded in a basis , and the corresponding equations were solved subject to the condition that the wave functions vanish at the boundary .",
    "the coefficients for the valence orbitals @xmath8 , along with the various expansion coefficients in  ( [ eq : expn ] ) , were obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath22-electron atomic hamiltonian .",
    "since the bound - state close - coupling calculations generate different nonorthogonal sets of orbitals for each atomic state , their subsequent use is somewhat complicated .",
    "on the other hand , our configuration expansions for the atomic target states contained between 10 and 50 configurations for each state and hence could still be used in the collision calculations with the available computational resources .",
    "the number of spectroscopic bound states that can be generated in the above scheme depends on the box radius . in the present calculations , the latter",
    "was set to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 m is the bohr radius .",
    "this allowed us to obtain accurate descriptions of the beryllium states with principal quantum number for the valence electron up to @xmath25 .",
    "as for the bsr method , the nonrelativistic formulation of the ccc method was adopted .",
    "we describe the be atom by a model of two valence electrons above a frozen hartree - fock ( 1s@xmath26 ) core .",
    "this is the same approximation as in the present bsr calculations .",
    "the calculations of the be target states start with the hartree - fock calculation for the be@xmath4 ion , which allows us to obtain the @xmath27 core orbital .",
    "the quasi one - electron hartree - fock hamiltonian of the be@xmath4 ion is then diagonalized in a basis of laguerre functions .",
    "we add a one - electron polarization potential to the be@xmath4 hamiltonian to improve the agreement of the be@xmath4 energy levels with the corresponding experimental values .",
    "the number of laguerre functions is @xmath28 , and the exponential fall - offs were chosen as @xmath29 with the angular momentum ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "the result of the diagonalization are one - electron ( pseudo ) states of the be@xmath4 ion . in the present calculations we drop the two highest - lying be@xmath4 states , as they lead to high - energy be states that are always closed at the energies considered in the present work .",
    "the one - electron basis is then used to expand the wave function of the be atom in a set of antisymmetric two - electron configurations .",
    "we include all configurations of the type @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition we include @xmath34 configurations with @xmath35 .",
    "this choice of configurations is practically the same as in  ( [ eq : bsr - ci ] ) .",
    "the latter configurations allow us to accurately account for the electron - electron correlations that are important for the ground state and the low - lying excited states of the be atom .",
    "the former set of configurations provides a description of physical and pseudo excited states as well as a square - integrable representation of the target continuum .",
    "this set of configurations is used to diagonalize the quasi two - electron hamiltonian of be and thereby obtain the set of be target states used in the scattering calculations .",
    "we include a two - electron polarization potential to further improve the description of the ground state and the low - lying excited states .",
    "these one- and two - electron polarization potentials are employed in the ccc calculations but are not adopted in the bsr model . in practice , however , the polarization potentials lead to only minor changes in the target wave functions .",
    ".[tab : e ] binding energies ( in  ev ) for the spectroscopic target states included in the bsr and ccc expansions . [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note , however , that this procedure is somewhat ambiguous in the present case .",
    "since the resonance is very wide and located close to the elastic threshold , the energy dependence of the phase shift given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) is disturbed . as a result ,",
    "the phase shift increases by less than @xmath36 radians as the energy passes through the resonance .",
    "another possibility , although not unique either , is to define the resonance parameters from the analysis of the relevant partial - wave ( here the ) cross section .",
    "an estimate for the resonance energy is then obtained from the maximum of the cross section while the ( full ) width is determined from half the height of this maximum .",
    "table  [ tab : g ] also presents the resonance parameters generated in this way .",
    "the difference between the bsr and ccc predictions , and the difference between the values obtained in the two ways of analyzing the results , provide an indication of the likely uncertainty of the resonance parameters in the present calculations .",
    "taking the averages of the results obtained in the schemes outlined above , we estimate the position at about 0.31  ev @xmath37  ev above the elastic threshold with a width of 0.40  ev @xmath38  ev .",
    "these parameters differ considerably from the numerous results obtained with model potentials  @xcite or complex - rotation - based methods  @xcite methods .",

    "[ fig : dip]@xmath41[fig : exch ] for dipole , nondipole , and exchange transitions , respectively .",
    "we compare our bsr and ccc predictions with the published rmps  @xcite results .",
    "for the very weak transitions , we notice some resonance - like structure near and slightly above the ionization threshold .",
    "these structures are , indeed , typical for pseudostate calculations , even if the @xmath22-electron and @xmath42-electron configurations are constructed in a fully consistent manner with each other .",
    "the degree of visibility depends on the number of points displayed .",
    "note , however , that rate coefficients involve convolution of the cross sections with the appropriate electron energy distribution function .",
    "this , together with the small values of the cross sections for which these structures appear , should ensure that there are no serious problems in collisional radiative models that employ our results .",
    "overall , we trust that the very close agreement between several independently obtained results further solidifies the confidence of the plasma modeling community in using these datasets .",
    "ionization cross sections are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : ion ] and  [ fig : ion2 ] .",
    "the and ionization cross sections were obtained as the sum of the excitation cross section to all beryllium autoionizing states and the continuum pseudostates .",
    "we assumed that the radiative decay of the autoionizing states is negligible in comparison to the autoionization channel .",
    "we find very good agreement between the present and ccc-409 results , but the agreement with the earlier rmps  @xcite and tdcc results  @xcite is also very satisfactory for ionization from both the @xmath39 ground state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ion ] ) and the metastable excited @xmath40 state ( fig .",

    "this is essentially due to the well - known term dependence of the @xmath17 orbital  @xcite .",
    "since the tdcc model employed a @xmath17 orbital that is close to the hartree - fock orbital optimized on the @xmath40 state , the tdcc results displayed here are expected to be most appropriate for this state .",

    "[ fig : total ] exhibits the grand total cross section for electron collisions with beryllium atoms in their @xmath39 ground state , i.e. , the sum of angle - integrated elastic , excitation , and ionization cross sections .",
    "while the elastic cross section provides the largest contribution over the energy range shown , excitation also contributes substantially , approaching 50% for incident energies above 50  ev .",
    "overall , ionization processes represent less than 10% of the grand total cross section .",
    "since the momentum - transfer rather than the elastic cross section is typically important for plasma modeling , it is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : total ] .",
    "we have presented an extensive set of electron scattering data for neutral beryllium , including elastic scattering , momentum transfer , excitation , and ionization processes .",
    "while state - to - state excitation cross sections were obtained for all transitions between the lowest 21 states of beryllium , results were presented for only a few selected transitions .",
    "the calculations were performed with a parallel version of the bsr code  @xcite , in which a basis is employed to represent the continuum functions inside the sphere .",
    "furthermore , we utilize nonorthogonal orbitals , both in constructing the target states and in representing the scattering functions . in order to independently verify the accuracy of the bsr calculations",
    ", we also carried out ccc calculations with an entirely different formulation of the problem and the associated computer code .",
    "very good agreement between the bsr and ccc results was found for all calculated cross sections .",
    "the present calculations were motivated to a large extent by the importance of accurate and thoroughly assessed collision data . for excitation as well as ionization from the ground state and the most important metastable @xmath0 state ,",
    "we essentially confirm , where available , results from earlier rmps  @xcite and tdcc  @xcite calculations .",
    "furthermore , we found a significant term dependence in the ionization results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states , respectively .",
    "the elastic cross section at low energies is dominated by a strong shape resonance in the @xmath45 , odd - parity channel .",
    "since this resonance is likely of critical importance for transport processes , we carried out a systematic convergence study for its parameters .",
    "the present results , namely a position of about 0.31  ev @xmath37  ev above the elastic threshold with a width of 0.40  ev @xmath38  ev , are very different from recent predictions based on a model - potential method  @xcite and also on a complex - rotation approach  @xcite .",
    "based on our convergence studies , as well as a detailed comparison between the bsr and ccc results , we estimate the accuracy of the present dataset to be 10% or better when these data are used to obtain the relevant rate coefficients for plasma modeling applications .",
