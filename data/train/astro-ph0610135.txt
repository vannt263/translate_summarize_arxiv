    "the current cosmological paradigm of a flat universe with low matter density ( ) consisting of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and dark energy has become established recently through a variety of astronomical observations , especially the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , supernova hubble diagram , and statistics of large galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these key techniques probe the large - scale , high - redshift universe where the development of cosmic structure may be studied in the linear clustering regime ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "although the standard model appears to have withstood every test thus far ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , testing the  model on small scales , fully into the non - linear regime ( @xmath17 ) , will further our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution and may also refine the fundamental parameters of the world model itself .",
    "the dark matter halos of galaxies and clusters are the largest virialized manifestations of small - scale , non - linear clustering .",
    "an important probe of the structure of dark matter halos is the relationship between concentration and virial mass .",
    "the concentration parameter is defined as , @xmath18 , where @xmath19  the `` virial radius ''  is usually taken to be the radius within which the average density equals @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath22 is a number typically between @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the scale radius of the nfw profile @xcite , but it is replaced by @xmath25 , the radius where the logarithmic density slope equals -2 , for more general profiles @xcite . the virial mass ( @xmath1 ) is the mass enclosed within @xmath19 .",
    "n - body simulations of cdm models find that @xmath0 declines slowly with increasing @xmath1 but with substantial intrinsic scatter , independent of @xmath1 ( @xcite , hereafter b01 ; @xcite , hereafter d04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "for a given @xmath1 the value of @xmath0 in cdm models varies significantly with changes in cosmological parameters , particularly the normalization , , and @xmath26 , the parameter representing the dark energy equation of state ( @xcite ; d04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of intrinsic scatter in the @xmath3 relation is a robust prediction of cdm models , though preferentially selecting relaxed , early forming systems yields smaller scatter than for the entire halo population @xcite .",
    "the expected decrease of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath1 in cdm models has yet to be confirmed by observations .",
    "optical studies of groups and clusters ( @xmath27 ) using several different techniques ",
    "galaxy dynamics @xcite , redshift - space caustics @xcite , and weak gravitational lensing @xcite  all are consistent with no variation in @xmath0",
    ". however , the @xmath3 relations obtained by these studies are consistent with the concordance model .",
    "x - ray studies of the @xmath3 relation using data from the",
    "_ asca_satellite @xcite found , @xmath28 , much steeper than produced in cdm models ( b01 ; d04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has only become possible with data from the _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  satellites to obtain spatially resolved temperature measurements of sufficient quality for reliable x - ray constraints on the mass profiles of elliptical galaxies , galaxy groups , and clusters ( e.g. , see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . indeed ,",
    "our recent study of the mass profiles of seven early - type galaxies with _ chandra _  indicates @xmath3 values consistent with @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 relations for clusters ( @xmath29 ) obtained using _",
    "@xcite and _ chandra _",
    "@xcite each are consistent with no variation in @xmath0 and with the gentle decline with increasing @xmath1 expected for cdm models . in each case the scatter in @xmath30 about the mean relation is not well constrained and is consistent with the cdm prediction .",
    "our present investigation aims to improve significantly the constraints on the @xmath3 relation by analyzing a wider mass range with many more systems than the previous _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  studies . for this purpose",
    "we undertook a program to obtain accurate mass constraints on relaxed systems with @xmath31 , representing 24 individual early - type galaxies and galaxy groups / clusters , each of which possesses high - quality _ chandra _  and/or _ xmm _  data @xcite .",
    "to these systems we added results for 15 relaxed , massive clusters from @xcite and @xcite . using this combined sample , optimized for x - ray mass measurements , we obtain empirical constraints on the local @xmath3 relation with a simple power - law model and compare this model to the predictions of a suite of cdm models .",
    "we note that the primary purpose of this paper is to assemble accurate @xmath3 measurements from _ chandra _  and _ xmm _",
    "observations from galaxy to cluster scales and to test whether @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath1 similar to that predicted by cdm models",
    ". however , we also make an initial attempt to constrain the parameters of cdm models to examine the efficacy of the @xmath3 relation in this regard and to highlight sources of systematic error both in the models and data that need to be addressed with future studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the x - ray @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements in  [ obs ] .",
    "our procedure for fitting a power - law model to the @xmath3 data is discussed in  [ method ] .",
    "we define the cosmological models that are compared to the x - ray data in  [ models ] .",
    "we present our results in  [ results ] and discuss sources of systematic error in  [ sys ] . in  [ conc ] we give our conclusions . all distance - related quantities , unless stated otherwise , are computed assuming a flat universe with @xmath5 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33  km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34  with @xmath35 .",

    "however , essentially all of conclusions in  [ results ] remain unchanged if we consider the bias for relaxed early forming systems to be 15% rather than 10% , within the range obtained by current simulations @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are the ocdm and decdm models (  [ clusters ] , see fig.[fig.errors.clusters ] ) , for which the @xmath179 boost in @xmath62 would bring the models into slightly better agreement with the data .",
    "however , the ocdm model is still rejected at @xmath180 confidence , and the @xmath163 open cdm models are still excluded ( @xmath11 conf . ) , the latter provided that at least a 5% bias ( of the expected @xmath15 ) for relaxed , early forming systems applies .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the level of systematic error suggested by cdm simulations to affect the x - ray mass measurements does not change the conclusions of our present study .      in order to use the x - ray @xmath3 relation for precision constraints on cosmological parameters",
    ", it is necessary to be able to predict halo concentrations produced in different cosmological models with high precision .",
    "this must be achieved with a semi - analytic procedure , because it is not feasible to resort to n - body simulations to fully investigate parameter space for obtaining confidence regions .",
    "the procedure proposed by b01 is currently one of the most promising models of this kind . with just two parameters @xmath101 and @xmath94 ( see  [ models ] ) it can reproduce the results of cdm n - body simulations with ranges of power spectrum shapes , @xmath8 normalizations , matter content , and dark energy variables @xmath26 ( b01 , @xcite ) .    recently ,",
    "@xcite show that the normalizations of the b01 models ( i.e. , @xmath94 values ) obtained by different investigators analyzing halos covering approximately the same mass range ( @xmath181 ) can differ by 10 - 20% . for halos with @xmath182 ,",
    "the halos of @xcite prefer @xmath105 and @xmath183 while those @xcite prefer @xmath107 .",
    "the `` cluster '' halos ( @xmath184 ) studied by d04 suggest a higher normalization @xmath110 . because so few studies have investigated the high - mass halo regime , it is unclear whether these differences reflect numerical details in the simulations or demand a revision of the b01 model .",
    "more studies of the concentrations of the highest mass halos are very much needed .    in this context",
    "it is important to note that @xcite have recently studied the @xmath3 relation of massive halos , where most of their halos have @xmath185 .",
    "they obtain power - law fit parameters @xmath186 and @xmath187 for the model  but with @xmath188 . converting their results to @xmath189 yields a 6% reduction in the concentration , @xmath190 , which is just 2% larger than the d04 value quoted in table [ tab.models.cm ] .",
    "we consider this quite good agreement , considering the differences between theoretical studies noted above for lower mass halos .",
    "finally , we mention that if we adopt the lowest normalization quoted in the literature ( @xmath105 , @xmath183 , @xcite ) for our entire mass range , then in order for the  model to match the x - ray data , it is necessary to boost the concentrations produced in the  model by another 16% over the @xmath175 attributed to the preferential selection of relaxed , early forming systems .",
    "this 16% increase can be achieved by increasing either ( @xmath191 ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath192 ) , or both .",
    "we note that the 99% upper limit derived in  [ all ] would increase  from 1.07 to 1.15 if @xmath183 .",
    "the published cdm predictions for the @xmath3 relation we have considered in this paper are all derived from dissipationless n - body simulations containing only dark matter . while the details of gasdynamics should be unimportant for massive systems ( @xmath193 ) , the effects of dissipation and feedback from star formation and agn likely influence the dark matter profile inferred from observations of lower mass halos .",
    "it is noteworthy that the systems with @xmath194 show the largest deviations from the  model (  [ all ] ) . for most of these",
    "the _ chandra _  data require a significant contribution of stellar mass from the central galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , allowing for adiabatic contraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the dark matter profile in most cases degrades the fits , suggesting a more complex interplay between the baryons and the dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some cosmological simulations with gas predict a small , but significant , systematic increase ( @xmath195 ) in the concentration of the total mass @xcite , but the inability of cdm simulations to reproduce observed x - ray temperature and density profiles within 50 - 100  kpc of cluster centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes it difficult to interpret the reliability of such results .",
    "future precision cosmology studies which aim to use the x - ray @xmath3 relation for low - mass systems ( @xmath196 ) will require better understanding of the influence of the central galaxy on the inferred dark matter distribution .",
    "we present the concentration ( @xmath0)-virial mass ( @xmath1 ) relation of 39 galaxy systems ranging in mass from individual early - type galaxies up to the most massive galaxy clusters , @xmath2 .",
    "we selected for analysis the most relaxed systems possessing the highest quality data currently available in the _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  public data archives .",
    "measurements for 24 systems were taken from our recent work @xcite which populate the lower mass portion of the sample ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "we obtained results for 15 massive galaxy clusters in our sample from the studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our principal objective is to measure the @xmath3 relation accurately from galaxy to cluster scales and determine whether @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath1 as generally predicted by cdm models .",
    "however , we also use the @xmath3 relation to provide an initial demonstration of the ability of the @xmath3 relation to constrain cosmological parameters , which also serves to highlight key sources of systematic error  both in the theoretical models and the observations .",
    "we parameterize the x - ray @xmath3 relation using a simple power - law model .",
    "the best estimates of the parameters  the slope ( @xmath63 ) and normalization ( @xmath62 ) evaluated at @xmath198  were obtained via linear regression in log space taking into account the uncertainties on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we employed the bces method of @xcite for this analysis .",
    "fitting the power - law model to the entire sample yields @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( quoted errors @xmath126 ) .",
    "the slope @xmath63 is negative and inconsistent with 0 at @xmath4 .",
    "the previous studies of galaxy clusters ( @xmath193 ) with _ chandra _  and _ xmm _  by @xcite and @xcite did not place strong constraints on @xmath63 , and were quite consistent with @xmath151 ;",
    "i.e. , it is the lower mass galaxy groups that require @xmath152 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "recent optical studies of the @xmath3 relation in the group - cluster regime ( see  [ intro ] ) also do not place strong constraints on the slope and are very consistent with @xmath199 .",
    "our analysis , therefore , provides crucial evidence that @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , as expected in cdm models ( @xcite ; b01 ; d04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we compare the x - ray data to the  model ( with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath141 ) , the `` concordance model '' effectively representing the combined constraints from the first year of wmap cmb data , supernovae , and galaxy surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we judge the median @xmath3 relation of the  model to be consistent with the empirical power - law fit provided the x - ray sample consists of the most relaxed , early forming systems , for which a systematic increase in the concentrations of @xmath15 is expected @xcite .",
    "we measure an intrinsic scatter in @xmath127 of @xmath128 in excellent agreement with the prediction of cdm simulations for the most relaxed , early forming systems .",
    "the amount of scatter is a robust prediction of cdm variants and provides additional evidence that our sample comprises the most relaxed systems that are best suited for x - ray mass measurements requiring approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .    the x - ray @xmath3 relation places interesting constraints on . within the context of the concordance model noted above",

    "this confidence range is conservative as explained in ",

    "next we compare the x - ray data to the  model ( with @xmath161 , @xmath143 , @xmath155 , @xmath200 ) which effectively updates the  model using the analysis of the third year of wmap data @xcite .",
    "the x - ray @xmath3 relation rejects the model at the 99.99% confidence level .",
    "the primary reason for the poor performance of the  model is the low value of , but the lower value of  and the tilt of the power spectrum also contribute to the poor fit .",
    "for this comparison we have assumed a uniform bias for relaxed , early forming halos of @xmath201 , as suggested by numerical simulations .",
    "this bias would have to be @xmath202 to bring the  model into agreement with the x - ray data .",
    "while the early - type galaxy and group - cluster mass halos @xmath203 studied here apparently prefer slightly higher concentrations than predicted for typical halos in the concordance @xmath204cdm model , the opposite is true for late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this may indicate that a selection / formation - time bias operates across the galaxy type spectrum , with late - type galaxies inhabiting the low - concentration tail of the distribution ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since d04 provide results of power - law fits to the @xmath3 relations of massive clusters formed in a variety of cdm models , including an open model and several dark energy models , we analyze separately the x - ray @xmath3 relation for the 22 systems in our sample with @xmath29 . in this mass range",
    "we obtain @xmath62 and @xmath205 values consistent with those inferred from previous _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm _  studies in the cluster mass regime noted above @xcite .",
    "as also found for the entire sample , the @xmath3 relation of the high - mass subsample is consistent with the  model and very inconsistent with the  model .",
    "however , an open model with @xmath163 is ruled out ( @xmath11 confidence ) from joint consideration of only the x - ray @xmath3 relation and published constraints on  from the analysis of the abundances of galaxy clusters ( @xmath206 , see  [ clusters ] ) . since cluster abundance studies also find @xmath164 if @xmath12 , using the x - ray @xmath3 data we find that we can also reject cdm models with @xmath12 at a high significance level ( @xmath165 confidence ) .",
    "consequently , the combination of the x - ray @xmath3 relation and cluster abundances ( and local constraints on the age of the universe ) provides novel evidence for a flat , low-@xmath13 universe with dark energy using observations only in the local ( @xmath14 ) universe .",
    "if the values of , , and @xmath86 of the  model are correct , agreement with the x - ray @xmath3 relation may be achieved by increasing the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath26 .",
