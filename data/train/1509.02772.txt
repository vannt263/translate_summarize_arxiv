    "as two molecules are brought together , the coulomb interaction of electrons and nuclei in one molecule with those in the other increases , meaning that the eigenstates of the isolated molecules are not eigenstates of the full hamiltonian . however ,",
    "if the intermolecular interaction is weak , it is often useful to think of the system as two interacting molecules as opposed to one supermolecule . to do so , one expands the full hamiltonian  all the interactions between particles in either molecule  in the basis of molecular states , and the off - diagonal elements of that expansion are the couplings  @xcite .",
    "excitonic couplings are interactions between excited states localized on different molecules . in the single - exciton manifold",
    "relevant to weak illumination , the frenkel hamiltonian of a system of two interacting two - level molecules is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling between the donor and the acceptor , whose excitation energies are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the coupling is often described as containing short - range and long - range contributions .",
    "short - range effects include exchange , overlap of donor and acceptor wavefunctions , and exciton transfer mediated by charge - transfer states  @xcite . because they depend on the spatial overlap between donor and acceptor wavefunctions , short - range terms decrease exponentially with distance and are consequently often neglected .",
    "neglecting the short - range couplings leaves only the long - range coulomb interaction , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are spatial coordinates and @xmath10 is the transition density between the ground ( @xmath11 ) and excited ( @xmath12 ) states of molecule @xmath13 ( either the donor @xmath14 or the acceptor @xmath15 ) .",
    "we return to the appropriate choice of the relative permittivity @xmath16 below .    because eq .  [ eq : coul ] resembles the interaction of two charge distributions , the integral",
    "can be simplified using elementary approximations from electrostatics .",
    "the various approximations  summarized in table  [ tbl : methods]differ in how they condense all the information in the continuous transition densities into something more manageable and discrete .",
    "the simplest approximation , useful for intermolecular separations much larger than the sizes of the molecules , is the point - dipole approximation ( pd ) , obtained as the lowest - order term in the multipole expansion of eq .",
    "[ eq : coul ]  @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the separation between the molecules ( i.e. , the centers of their transition densities ) and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are their transition dipole moments ,    however , pd is not accurate even at intermediate molecular separations  @xcite .",
    "a sequence of more accurate approximations can be obtained by representing the transition density as originating from an array of suitably chosen transition charges , @xmath21 the charges @xmath22 and their positions @xmath23 are chosen once and for all by fitting them to the _ ab initio _ transition density , allowing each subsequent coupling calculation to be much faster .",
    "the different methods that have been used  extended dipole , tresp , and tdc  differ only in the number of transition charges used .    in the extended dipole approximation ( ed )",
    ", two transition charges are used per molecule , so that the coulomb interaction becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the positions of the positive and negative charges and @xmath26 is the magnitude of the charges . to be consistent with the point - dipole approximation at large separations , the charge @xmath27 and the distance @xmath28",
    "must be chosen so that @xmath29 , essentially making @xmath27 an additional free parameter , whose tunability ensures ed agrees with the exact results better than pd .",
    "the opposite extreme is the transition density cube  ( tdc ) method  @xcite , where the transition charges are located on a cartesian grid , making the method a direct numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : coul ] .",
    "the main difficulty is that the grid needs to be fine  @xcite , containing many charges even in areas where the transition density is negligible . for bacteriochlorophylls ,",
    "the method converges when the number of charges in each molecule is around 500000  @xcite , making the calculation of their pairwise interactions slow and prone to rounding errors .    between the two extremes of ed and tdc",
    "lies the transition monopole approximation ( tma )  @xcite , which assigns one transition charge to each atom .",
    "if hydrogens are excluded , this leads to about 50 charges per bchl , a happy medium between 2 and 500000 .",
    "the atomic transition charges were initially assigned using a mulliken or hirshfeld population analysis  @xcite , but this approach is not uniquely defined and was found to not accurately reproduce the shape of the transition density  @xcite .",
    "the method of transition charges from electrostatic potentials ( tresp )  @xcite solves this problem by fitting the charges to best represent the transition density . for molecules with few atoms ,",
    "additional fitting parameters can be supplied by placing multipoles at each atom , which slightly improves the accuracy at the shortest separations  @xcite .",
    "however , 50 charges offer enough free parameters that tresp is as accurate as tdc for chlorophylls  @xcite , which is why we do not include tdc results in this study .",
    "an alternative to transition charges and eq .",
    "[ eq : charges ] is to expand the transition densities in a convenient chemical basis set and compute the resulting integrals in eq .",
    "[ eq : coul ] using optimized quadrature techniques of quantum chemistry  @xcite . like tdc",
    ", this approach gives the exact coulomb coupling within the chosen basis , but is more expensive than tresp because it still requires numerical integration every time .",
    "as with tdc , we do not consider this approach here because tresp is sufficiently accurate .    once long - range couplings have been calculated using one of the methods surveyed above",
    ", any further improvement must come from including short - range effects .",
    "short - range couplings are particularly important in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah )  @xcite and other flat molecules  @xcite whose lack of steric hindrance allows for tight packing . among photosynthetic complexes , large short - range couplings have been reported in lh2  @xcite and in the special pair of reaction centers  @xcite .",
    "we return to these cases below .",
    "the simplest situation is the coupling between a donor and an acceptor that are identical molecules . in that case , the eigenenergies of eq .",
    "[ eq : matrixham ] are , meaning that @xmath4 can be obtained by halving the difference between the energies of the two excitonic states , @xmath30 which can be obtained from an electronic - structure calculation of the entire dimer .",
    "the same approach can be extended to heterodimers  @xcite .",
    "scholes et  al .",
    "used the eigenstates @xmath31 of @xmath32 ( from the quantum - chemical treatment of the dimer ) and the site energies @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( from the quantum - chemical treatment of the monomers ) to calculate @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "doing so assumed that the effective shifts in the site energies of the two molecules ( induced by the presence of the other ) are equal , an approximation that was removed when the method was refined by madjet et al  @xcite .",
    "they used the fact that heterodimer eigenstates are not fully delocalized , and that site - energy shifts can be computed from the extent of delocalization , which they obtained by comparing the monomer and dimer transition dipole moments . in this work ,",
    "we use the closely related fragment excitation difference ( fed ) method  @xcite , which measures the delocalization in the eigenstates more directly , by determining the difference between the excitation densities on the two molecular fragments . along with @xmath31 ,",
    "this suffices to calculate @xmath4 exactly , given a particular electronic - structure method and basis set .",
    "all coupling and energy calculations were performed on bacteriochlorophyll _ a _ ( bchl__a _ _ ) . in each case , the starting point was bchl__a _ _ taken from the @xmath33 position in the crystal structure of the lh2 complex of the purple bacterium _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "an important preliminary question is which molecular geometry to use .",
    "it has been argued that the crystal structure is not reflective of the molecular configuration _ in vivo _ and that , consequently , the geometry should be computationally optimized before calculating the excitonic couplings  @xcite .",
    "this optimization has generally been carried out using either hf or dft . to the naked eye",
    ", the differences between the crystal structure and the optimized geometry appear small ( figure  [ fig : optimization ] ) and one might think that this would result in only a minor correction to the couplings .",
    "however , the electronic properties of chlorophyll molecules are known to vary substantially with the molecular geometry  @xcite . to test the influence of geometry optimization on bchl couplings , we compared the electronic - structure results obtained with different geometry optimizations and with experiment .",
    "we calculated the @xmath34 transition energy at the crystal structure geometry and following three different geometry optimizations : hf/ and dft / b3lyp/ ( gradient convergence criterion of in each case ,  4.0  @xcite ) , as well as molecular mechanics with allinger s mm3 forcefield  @xcite ( gradient convergence criterion of @xmath35kcal / mol /  , tinker 7.1  @xcite ) .",
    "the transition energy itself was calculated using both cis/ and tddft / b3lyp/ , as shown in table  [ tbl : energies ] .",
    "we found that the cis calculation performed on the crystal structure gave the best agreement with the experimentally measured value for this transition , 770 nm  @xcite .",
    "all geometry optimizations introduced errors much larger than the shifts in the @xmath34 peak if the spectrum is measured in different solvents or following aggregation .",
    "this suggests that geometry optimization of this molecule prior to electronic - structure calculations can introduce large and unnecessary errors .",
    "consequently , all the following calculations were performed at the crystal - structure geometry using cis/.    table  [ tbl : energies ] also compares the @xmath34 energies of the full bchl molecule and of the molecule with its phytyl tail removed .",
    "the removal of the tail changes the transition by at around 1 nm and can therefore be safely performed in the interest of computational speed .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]      consistency is important to ensure a fair comparison of different methods . in particular",
    ", all the underlying electronic - structure calculations must use the same method and basis set , because different methods can give substantially different results  @xcite .",
    "we used cis/ , but this choice is not essential to our argument , since there is no reason to expect that other methods would be less affected by the geometric errors that are central to this paper .",
    "two parameters in coupling calculations are difficult to determine _ ab initio _ : the relative permittivity @xmath16 and the magnitude @xmath36 of the transition dipole moment .",
    "the vacuum value @xmath37 is an appropriate choice for nearest - neighbor couplings in tightly packed aggregates , but for more distant molecules , the coulomb interaction is screened by the intervening medium .",
    "the appropriate choice of @xmath16 for light - harvesting environments has been discussed extensively  @xcite , and values from 1 to 2 have been used .",
    "this debate is beyond the scope of this work ; instead , we report vacuum couplings , which can easily be adjusted by multiplication with @xmath38 .",
    "our conclusions about the sizes of relative errors are unaffected , because all the couplings are scaled in the same proportion .",
    "the second uncertain parameter is the magnitude of the @xmath34 transition dipole moment , which tends to be overestimated by cis calculations  @xcite . for the crystal - structure geometry ,",
    "cis/ predicts a @xmath34 dipole moment of @xmath39d , significantly larger than the best experimental estimate of 6.1d ( in vacuum )  @xcite . here",
    "again we make the simplest choice , reporting all results with the theoretically predicted value @xmath40 , which can be corrected by multiplication with @xmath41 , where @xmath36 is the desired magnitude of the dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "again , the conclusions about the relative errors are unaffected because all couplings would be scaled by the same factor .",
    "having made these preliminary choices , we compared the couplings predicted by pd , ed , tresp , and fed , calculated between two identical bchl molecules , displaced perpendicular to their bacteriochlorin rings by a separation ranging from 5 to 20 ( figure  [ fig : separation]a ) .",
    ".the influence of geometry on the calculated wavelength of the @xmath34 transition of bchl__a__. the transition was calculated using both cis and tddft based on the crystal structure and on the geometries obtained by optimizing the crystal structure using different routines .",
    "the best agreement with experiment is obtained at the crystal structure geometry , indicating that geometry optimization may induce large and uncontrolled errors .",
    "in addition , removing the phytyl tail has a negligible effect , as expected . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the means and standard deviations in figure  [ fig : orients]b indicate that the difference between tresp and fed is less than the geometric uncertainty in the vast majority of cases .",
    "however , focusing on the mean and standard deviation risks ignoring the outliers , which may indicate additional failures of tresp .",
    "of particular concern are configurations where the two bchls are parallel but offset from each other .",
    "the offset can give rise to a relatively large mg ",
    "mg distance even though portions of the two molecules might be close to each other .",
    "the offset - parallel arrangement arises in some natural complexes , giving rise to some of the most strongly coupled bchls in nature . to check the applicability of tresp to those cases , we calculated the couplings between three such pairs , as shown in table [ tab : closest ] .    for the two nearest - neighbor couplings in the lh2 complex of purple bacteria ,",
    "the error of ed with respect to fed is over 50% on average , confirming its poor performance seen in figure  [ fig : orients]b .",
    "the error of tresp is , as expected , larger than the average in figure  [ fig : orients]b , at 14% and 24% for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , a result consistent with previous work finding short - range corrections of 17% and 24% in the two cases  @xcite .",
    "however , the geometric errors are also larger , because small displacements of particular atoms can have an outsized influence on the coupling when those atoms are close together . in the two cases from lh2 ,",
    "the average geometric uncertainty in the tresp couplings is 43% , substantially more than the 19% error with respect to fed .",
    "thus , we can again conclude that the uncertainty in the atomic coordinates is a larger source of error than excluding the short - range contributions .",
    "special pairs in reaction centers are even more strongly coupled , and the results in table  [ tab : closest ] indicate that all the methods fail .",
    "in particular , fed shows a considerable admixture of higher excited states , indicating that it is inappropriate to model this case as two coupled q@xmath44 transitions ( eq .  [ eq : matrixham ] ) .",
    "madjet et  al .",
    "@xcite checked the consistency of the same calculation by comparing the values of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 parameters of their theory ; these values were unequal by a large margin , especially for certain electronic - structure methods , indicating the failure of the effective two - state hamiltonian .",
    "the difference between our coupling and that of madjet et  al .",
    "is probably caused by their optimization of the geometry .",
    "the failure of fed indicates that the special pair can not be considered as two coupled molecules but should be seen as one unit .",
    "this can also be diagnosed from the severe failure of tresp , whose geometric uncertainty is over  100% .",
    "therefore , the geometric uncertainty indicates not only the inherent uncertainty of tresp , but also the applicability of the two - state approximation . in difficult cases such as those just discussed ,",
    "the close separation between certain atoms will increase the uncertainty above the typical 20% , indicating that the calculation should be viewed with suspicion .",
    "we have presented a detailed comparison of methods for excitonic coupling calculations of bacteriochlorophylls , with a focus on the uncertanties that arise due to the uncertainties in the atomic positions . for tresp , these geometric uncertainties are much larger than the disagreement between tresp and the more accurate fed , indicating that the short - range contributions to the couplings are almost always a minor correction in comparison with the error bars , making the computational cost of obtaining them ( 67 orders of magnitude more than for tresp ) unjustified . furthermore , tresp is clearly preferrable over other the pd and ed approximations , both of which lead to errors much larger than the geometric uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we recommend the use of tresp for the calculation of excitonic couplings between bacteriochlorophylls at all separations and orientations , with the warning that particularly large geometric uncertainties may indicate a failure of the two - state approximation .    our error analysis can be extended to site energies and other components of eet simulations in order to determine the overall sensitivity to uncertainties in the experimental data .",
    "this will allow us to identify the theoretical predictions that do not depend sensitively on microscopic details and are thus more likely to apply to a wide range of pigment - protein complexes .",
