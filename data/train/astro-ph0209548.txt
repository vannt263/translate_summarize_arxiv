    "rotating magnetized neutron stars pass through different stages in their evolution ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; lipunov 1992 ) .",
    "initially , a rapidly rotating ( @xmath6 ) magnetized neutron star is expected to be active as a radiopulsar .",
    "the star spins down owing to the wind of magnetic field and relativistic particles from the region of the light cylinder @xmath7 ( goldreich and julian 1969 ) .",
    "however , after the neutron star spins - down sufficiently , the light cylinder radius becomes larger than magnetospheric radius @xmath8 where the ram pressure of external matter equals the magnetic pressure in the neutron star s dipole field .",
    "the relativistic wind is then suppressed by the inflowing matter ( shvartsman 1970 ) .",
    "the external matter may come from the wind from a binary companion or from the interstellar medium for an isolated neutron star .",
    "the centrifugal force in the equatorial region at @xmath8 is much larger than gravitational force if @xmath8 is much larger than the corotation radius @xmath9 . in this case",
    "the incoming matter tends to be flung away from the neutron star by its rotating magnetic field .",
    "this is the so called  propeller \" stage of evolution ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "the  propeller \" stage of evolution , though important , is still not well - understood theoretically .",
    "different studies have found different dependences for the spin - down rate of the star ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; davis , fabian , & pringle 1979 ; davis & pringle 1981 ; wang & robertson 1985 ; lipunov 1992 ) .",
    "observational signs of the propeller stage have been discussed by number of authors ( e.g. , stella , white , & rosner 1986 ; treves & colpi 1991 ; cui 1997 ; treves et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "mhd simulations of disk accretion to a rotating star in the propeller regime were done by wang and robertson ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , authors considered only equatorial plane and concentrated on investigation of instabilities at the boundary between the magnetosphere and surrounding medium",
    ". thus they could not investigate accretion along the magnetic poles of the star .",
    "an analytical model of disk accretion in the propeller regime was developed by lovelace , romanova , and bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1999 ) .",
    "disk accretion at the stage of weak propeller ( @xmath10 ) investigated numerically by romanova et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    the mentioned studies obtained possible trends of the propeller stage of evolution .",
    "however , two and three dimensional mhd simulations are needed to obtain more definite answers to the important physical questions .",
    "the questions which need to be answered are : ( 1 ) what are the physical conditions of the matter flow around the star in the propeller regime of accretion ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the spin - down rate of the star , and how does it depend on the star s magnetic moment and rotation rate and on the inflow rate of the external matter ?",
    "( 3 ) what is the accretion rate to the surface of the star and how does it depend on the star s rotation rate and magnetic moment ?",
    "( 4 ) what are the possible observational consequences of this stage of evolution ?",
    "this paper discusses results of axisymmetric , two - dimensional , resistive mhd simulations of accretion a rotating magnetized star in the  propeller \" regime .",
    "we treat the case when matter accretes spherically with the bondi accretion rate .",
    "bondi accretion to a non - rotating and a slowly rotating star was investigated by toropin et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter t99 ) .",
    "it was shown that the magnetized star accretes matter at a rate less than the bondi rate .",
    "toropina et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter t02 ) confirmed this result for stronger magnetic fields . in this paper",
    "we consider initial conditions similar to those in t02 , but investigate the case of rapidly rotating stars .",
    "section 2 gives a rough physical treatment of the propeller regime .",
    "section 3 describes the numerical model and computations .",
    "section 4 describes the main results from our simulations , and section 5 gives a numerical application of our results .",
    "section 6 gives the conclusions from this work .",
    "in the propeller regime the magnetospheric radius @xmath8 is larger than the corotation radius @xmath11 cm and incoming matter in the equatorial plane is flung away from the star . here , we assume @xmath12 , and @xmath13 s with @xmath14 the rotation period of the star",
    ". the magnetospheric radius is determined by a balance of the ram pressure of the inflowing matter @xmath15 against the magnetic pressure @xmath16 of the neutron star s field @xmath17 , where the @xmath18subscripts indicate that the quantity is evaluated at a distance @xmath8 , and @xmath3 is the star s magnetic moment .",
    "consider first the case of a non - rotating star .",
    "the bondi inflow velocity at @xmath8 is supersonic for specific heat ratios @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the accretion rate .",
    "for this case the ram pressure is approximately @xmath22 so that @xmath23 @xmath24 ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . here , @xmath25 , and @xmath26yr .    for a rapidly rotating star , @xmath27 , the dominant velocity is due to the rotation of the magnetosphere so that @xmath28 .",
    "the flow velocity is much larger than the sound speed so that this is a `` supersonic propeller '' ( davies et al . 1979 ) . neglecting the complicated two - dimensional nature of the plasma flow",
    ", we estimate @xmath29 , which gives @xmath30 @xmath31 ( wang & robertson 1985 ; lovelace , romanova , & bisnovatyi - kogan 2002 ) . in this limit",
    ", there is to a first approximation no accretion to the star ; all of the incoming matter is flung away from the star in the equatorial plane by the rotating magnetic field .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) give the same values for @xmath32 which corresponds to a period @xmath33 s. the propeller regime requires periods @xmath34 . at the other extreme , the condition that @xmath35 be less than the light cylinder radius gives the condition @xmath36 .",
    "the spin - down rate of the star can be estimated as @xmath37 , which is the magnetic torque at the radius @xmath8 .",
    "this assumes that @xmath38 at @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath39 this gives a spin - down time scale @xmath40 where the neutron star s moment of inertia @xmath41 is assumed to be @xmath42 g  @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "the angular momentum lost by the star goes into the outflow of material mainly in the equatorial plane .",
    "the rotational power lost by the star @xmath45 goes into the kinetic ( thermal plus flow ) energy of the equatorial outflow .",
    "we simulate the plasma flow in the propeller regime using an axisymmetric , resistive mhd code .",
    "the code incorporates the methods of local iterations and flux - corrected - transport ( zhukov , zabrodin , & feodoritova 1993 ) .",
    "the code is described in our earlier investigation of bondi accretion to a non - rotating magnetized star ( t99 ) .",

    "the equation of state is taken to be that for an ideal gas , @xmath53 , with specific heat ratio @xmath54 .",
    "a value of @xmath55 less than @xmath56 is expected in the case of an ionized gas because of the influence of the electron heat conduction .",
    "the equations incorporate ohm s law @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the electrical conductivity .",
    "the associated magnetic diffusivity , @xmath59 , is considered to be a constant within the computational region . in equation",
    "( 5 ) the gravitational force , @xmath60 , is due to the central star .",
    "the star rotates with angular velocity @xmath61 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the keplerian angular velocity at the stellar radius @xmath64 .",
    "simulations have been done for different values of @xmath65 .",
    "the intrinsic magnetic field of the star is taken to be an aligned dipole , @xmath66/{r^5}$ ] with @xmath67 and vector - potential @xmath68 .",
    "we use a cylindrical , inertial coordinate system @xmath69 with the @xmath70 axis parallel to the star s dipole moment @xmath71 and rotation axis @xmath72 .",
    "the equatorial plane is treated as symmetry plane .",
    "the vector potential @xmath73 is calculated so that @xmath74 at all times .",
    "the full set of equations is given in t99 .    to convert our equations to dimensionless form we measure length in units of the bondi radius @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the sound speed at infinity , density in units of the density at infinity @xmath77 , and magnetic field strength in units of @xmath78 which is the field at the pole of the numerical star ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "pressure is measured in units of @xmath80 .",
    "the magnetic moment is measured in units of @xmath81 .",
    "we measure velocity in units of the alfvn speed @xmath82 .",
    "however , in the plots we give the velocities in units of @xmath76 .    after putting equations ( 4)-(7 ) in dimensionless form , one finds three dimensionless parameters , two of which are @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the dimensionless magnetic diffusivity which may be interpreted as the reciprocal of the lundquist number @xmath85 ; and @xmath86 is the pressure at infinity .",
    "the third parameter is @xmath87 is of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "we also use a parameter @xmath89 to control the field strength of the star .",
    "it is defined by the equation @xmath90 , where @xmath91 has been varied in the range @xmath92 .",
    "simulations were done in a cylindrical `` can '' @xmath93 . the size of the region was taken to be @xmath94 , which is less then the sonic radius of the bondi flow @xmath95r_{b}=0.2r_b$ ] ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus matter inflows supersonically to the computational region .",
    "the inflow rate is taken to be the bondi ( 1952 ) accretion rate , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 for @xmath54 .",
    "the incoming matter is assumed to be unmagnetized .",
    "a uniform @xmath98 grid with @xmath99 cells was used . for the results discussed here @xmath100 .    the `` numerical star '' ,",
    "is taken to be a cylinder of radius @xmath64 and half axial length @xmath101 with @xmath102 . in the results presented here , @xmath103 . clearly , the numerical star is very large : the value of @xmath104 , although much less than unity , is much larger than the astrophysical ratio for a neutron star ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the grid size , @xmath106 , is about @xmath107 times smaller than the star s radius .",
    "the vector - potential @xmath108 of the intrinsic dipole field of the star is determined on the surface of the numerical star .",
    "the value of the vector potential on this surface is fixed corresponding to the numerical star being a perfect conductor .",
    "equivalently , the component of the @xmath52 field normal to the surface is fixed , but the other two components vary .",
    "the density and internal energy at the inner boundary ( the numerical star ) are set equal to small numerical values .",
    "thus , incoming matter with higher values of these parameters , is absorbed by the star .",
    "this treatment of the star is analogous to that used by ruffert ( 1994 ) .",
    "typically , the density of incoming matter is @xmath109 times larger than density inside the star @xmath110 . for a purely hydrodynamic spherical accretion flow",
    ", we verified that this accretor absorbs all incoming matter at the bondi rate .",
    "here , we first discuss simulations for the case @xmath111 @xmath112 , magnetic diffusivity @xmath113 ( equation 8) , and for field strength @xmath114 . at the end of this section",
    "we discuss the dependence of the results on @xmath115 , @xmath3 ( and @xmath89 ) , and @xmath116 .",
    "time is measured in units of the free - fall time from the top or the side of the simulation region , @xmath117 , with @xmath118 . for the rotating star , time is also given in terms of rotation periods of the star , @xmath119 .    for the mentioned values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath4 , the magnetospheric radius @xmath120 and corotation radius @xmath121 are equal for @xmath122 . for smaller angular velocities , @xmath123 , the matter flow around",
    "the star is close to that in the non - rotating case .",
    "for @xmath124 the flow exhibits the features expected in the  propeller \" regime .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the general nature of the flow in the propeller regime .",
    "two distinct regions separated by a shock wave are observed : one is the _ external _ region where matter inflows with the bondi rate and the density and velocity agree well with the bondi ( 1952 ) solution .",
    "the second is the _ internal _ region , where the flow is strongly influenced by the stellar magnetic field and rotation . the shock wave , which divides these regions , propagates outward as in the non - rotating case ( t99 ) . for a rotating star in the propeller regime",
    "the shock wave has the shape of an ellipsoid flattened along the rotation axis of the star .",
    "the region of the flow well within the shock wave is approximately time - independent .",
    "the accretion rate to the star becomes constant after about @xmath125 rotation periods of the star .    a new regime of matter flow forms inside the expanding shock wave .",
    "the rapidly rotating magnetosphere expels matter outward in the equatorial region .",
    "this matter flows radially outward forming a low - density rotating torus .",
    "the outflowing matter is decelerated when it reaches the shock wave . there , the flow changes direction and moves towards the rotation axis of the star .",
    "however , only a small fraction of this matter accretes to the surface of the star .",
    "most of the matter is expelled again in the equatorial direction by the rotating field of the star .",
    "thus , most of the matter circulates inside this inner region driven by the rapidly rotating magnetosphere .",
    "large - scale vortices form above and below the equatorial torus ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . in three dimensions",
    "vortices of smaller scale may also form .",
    "thus , at the propeller stage the significant part of the rotational energy of the star may go into the directed and thermal energy of the expelled plasma .",
    "the solid line in figure 3 shows the alfvn surface , where the magnetic energy - density equals the thermal plus kinetic energy - density , @xmath126 . in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the alfvn radius is @xmath127 . for @xmath128 , the magnetic pressure dominates , and",
    "the magnetic field is approximately that of a dipole . at larger distances the field",
    "is stretched by the outflowing plasma .",
    "matter inside the magnetopause ( the region of closed magnetic field lines inside the alfvn surface ) rotates with the angular velocity of the star ( see figure 4 ) . for @xmath129 , matter continues to rotate in the equatorial region but the angular velocity decreases with @xmath130 .",
    "figure 5a shows the radial variation of the velocities in the equatorial plane .",
    "matter is accelerated by the rotating magnetosphere for @xmath131 up to @xmath132 , but at larger distances the radial velocity decreases .",
    "the azimuthal velocity @xmath133 is significantly larger than the radial velocity at @xmath134 , but they become equal at larger distances .",
    "the sound speed @xmath135 is high inside the shock wave owing to the joule heating @xmath136 .",
    "nevertheless , the outflow is supersonic in the region @xmath137 .",
    "note , that above and below the equatorial plane the region of the supersonic outflow is larger ( see sonic surface line in the figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "figure 5b shows the variation of the velocities along the @xmath70axis .",
    "figure 6 shows the streamlines of the matter flow .",
    "matter free falls along the field lines going into the poles of the star .",
    "some matter which flows close to the @xmath70axis accretes to the surface of the star .",
    "however , matter more removed from the @xmath70axis comes close to the star , it is deflected by the rotating magnetic field , and it then moves outward in the equatorial plane .",
    "figure 7 shows the radial dependences of the different radial forces in the equatorial plane .",
    "one can see that for @xmath138 , the centrifugal force becomes dominant in accelerating the matter outward .",
    "however , at larger distances , @xmath139 , the pressure gradient force become larger and determines acceleration of matter .",
    "thus , centrifugal and pressure gradient forces accelerate matter in the radial direction .",
    "note , that in most of the region ( @xmath140 ) the magnetic force is negative so that it opposes the matter outflow .",
    "the results we have shown are for a relatively strong propeller .",
    "if the rotation rate is smaller , then the matter outflow become less intense . for @xmath141 ,",
    "no equatorial outflow is observed and the shock wave becomes more nearly spherical as it is in the non - rotating case . on the other hand",
    "the shock wave becomes more a more flattened ellipsoid for larger @xmath115 .",
    "matter rotates rigidly inside the alfvn radius @xmath142 while at large distances @xmath143 decreases .",
    "figure 8 shows the radial dependences of the angular velocity in the equatorial plane for different values of @xmath115 .",
    "figure 9 shows that only a small fraction of the bondi accretion rate accretes to the surface of the star .",
    "figure 9a shows that the accretion rate to the star decreases as the angular velocity of the star increases , @xmath144 . for a non - rotating star , @xmath145 in agreement with our earlier work ( t99 ) .",
    "figure 9b shows that the accretion rate to the star decreases as the star s magnetic moment increases , @xmath146 .",
    "we have also done a number of simulation runs for different magnetic diffusivities in the range @xmath147 , and from this we conclude that @xmath148 .",
    "accretion along the rotation axis of stars in the propeller regime was discussed by nelson , salpeter , and wasserman ( 1993 ) .",
    "three - dimensional instabilities ( e.g. , arons & lea 1976 ) not included in the present two - dimensional simulations may act to increase the accretion rate to the the star s surfaces .",
    "figure 10 shows the total angular momentum loss rate from the star as a function of @xmath115 .",
    "this was obtained by evaluating the integral @xmath149 over the surface of the numerical star . here",
    ", @xmath150 is the outward pointing surface area element and the @xmath151 subscript indicates the poloidal component .",
    "the dominant contribution to equation ( 9 ) is the magnetic field term , and this term increases relative to the matter term as @xmath2 increases . the dependence predicted by equation ( 3 )",
    ", @xmath152 is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the fact that the observed dependence , @xmath153 is steeper may be due to the fact that the magnetospheric radius is not much larger than the corotation radius . also , we find that @xmath154 for a factor of four range of @xmath3 about our main case . from simulation runs with magnetic diffusivities in the range @xmath147 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 is approximately independent of @xmath116 .",
    "here , we give the conversions of the dimensionless variables to physical values for the case @xmath112 , @xmath114 , and @xmath155 ( equation 8) . we consider accretion to a magnetized star with mass @xmath156 g. the density of the ambient interstellar matter is taken to be @xmath157  g@xmath158@xmath159 ( @xmath160  @xmath161 ) .",
    "we consider a higher than typical sound speed in the ism , @xmath162 km / s , in order to have a smaller bondi radius compatible with our simulations .",
    "the bondi radius is @xmath163 and the bondi ( 1952 ) accretion rate is @xmath164 where @xmath97 for @xmath165 , @xmath166@xmath159 , and @xmath167 . using the definitions @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and the fact that @xmath114",
    ", we obtain the magnetic field at the surface of the  numerical \" star @xmath170 g.    recall that the size of the numerical star is @xmath171 in all simulations .",
    "thus the magnetic moment of the numerical star is @xmath172 g@xmath159 .",
    "note that this is of the order of the magnetic moment of a neutron star with surface field @xmath173 g and radius @xmath174 cm .",
    "the numerical star rotates with angular velocity @xmath175 , where @xmath176 . for most of the figures @xmath111 , and",
    "this corresponds to a period of @xmath177 s.    using the mass accretion rate of equation ( 11 ) and @xmath178 , the magnetospheric radius of the non - rotating star , from equation ( 1 ) , is @xmath179 .",
    "the magnetospheric radius of the rotating star with @xmath111 , from equation ( 2 ) , is @xmath180 . from figure 8 note",
    "that the equatorial profile of the angular rotation rate @xmath181 for @xmath111 is approximately flat out to @xmath182 which is roughly the same as @xmath35 .",
    "as required , the corotation radius , @xmath183 , is appreciably less than @xmath35 . for smaller values of @xmath115 in figure 8",
    ", @xmath184 decreases gradually .",
    "this dependence on @xmath115 differs from that of equation ( 2 ) which may be due to the fact that @xmath35 is not very large compared with @xmath9 . as @xmath115 decreases , @xmath9 increases rapidly .",
    "thus the case @xmath185 , where @xmath186 , is not in the propeller regime .    for the considered case of @xmath112 , @xmath114 , @xmath155 , and @xmath111 , we have evaluated equation ( 9 ) numerically with the result that @xmath187 .",
    "the theoretical estimate of @xmath0 from equation ( 3 ) for the mentioned values of @xmath3 and @xmath35 is @xmath188 . a small , @xmath189 reduction of @xmath35 brings @xmath190 into coincidence with the @xmath0 from the simulations .",
    "axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of bondi accretion to a rotating magnetized star in the propeller regime of accretion have shown that : ( 1 ) a new regime of matter flow forms around a rotating star .",
    "matter falls down along the axis , but only a small fraction of the incoming matter accretes to the surface of the star .",

    "the rate of loss of angular momentum @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath1 , and it is approximately independent of @xmath4 .",
    "this dependence differs from the predicted dependence of equation ( 3 ) probably because the corotation radius is not much smaller than the magnetospheric radius @xmath8 .",
