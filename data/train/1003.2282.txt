    "embedding provides a way of including the effects of the substrate in a calculation of electronic structure over a restricted region of space.@xcite for example , embedding allows us to find the electronic structure at a surface by solving the schrdinger equation in the surface region , adding embedding potentials to the hamiltonian to include the effects of the semi - infinite substrate and vacuum regions.@xcite the embedding potentials ensure that the wave - functions ( or the green function ) in the surface region have the correct boundary corrections on the boundaries of the region , without matching wave - functions explicitly . the alternative",
    "to embedding is to solve the schrdinger equation for a slab of material , or a periodic array of slabs .",
    "however , slab calculations do not give the energy continuum of bulk states , and unless the slab is very thick , the localised surface states interact across the slab .",
    "embedding calculations have neither of these drawbacks .",
    "several methods have been developed over the years for finding the embedding potential for a semi - infinite substrate , with the full crystal potential , for solving the energy - dependent schrdinger equation in full - potential calculations of surface electronic structure.@xcite in this paper we develop a very fast method for calculating the embedding potential to replace a semi - infinite one - dimensional periodic potential .",
    "the surface region is embedded on to the vacuum coulomb tail , and at @xmath1 it is embedded on to the semi - infinite crystal potential.,width=453 ]    going from the full three - dimensional crystal potential to a one - dimensional potential may seem a retrograde step , but chulkov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently developed one - dimensional models of the bulk and surface potential ( figure 1 ) , which give an accurate description of electronic states at the surface .",
    "this has proved particularly useful in many - body and lifetime studies of shockley and image potential - induced surface states.@xcite this one - dimensional potential is of course felt by electrons moving in three dimensions , with a wave - function of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free - electron wave - vector parallel to the surface , which lies in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "our own interest lies in using these model surface potentials in the time - dependent schrdinger equation , which we solve by a new embedding technique.@xcite the crystal substrate is replaced by a time - dependent embedding potential , essentially the fourier transform of the energy - dependent embedding potential .",
    "this must be evaluated at a very fine energy grid over a very wide energy range  hence we need a method for finding the energy - dependent embedding potential as efficiently as possible .",
    "the general idea of embedding is that we partition space into two ( or more ) regions , solving the schrdinger equation explicitly in what we call region i , with the rest of space , region ii , replaced by an embedding potential added to the hamiltonian of region i. the embedding potential is defined over the interface @xmath5 between regions i and ii.@xcite using a variational method , it can be shown that the wave - function for the system , @xmath6 , satisfies the following schrdinger equation in region i , @xmath7=e\\psi(\\mathbf{r}),\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral is over @xmath5.@xcite the embedding potential @xmath8 is a function of two interface coordinates and is evaluated at trial energy @xmath9 ; the energy derivative term gives @xmath8 at the required energy @xmath10 , to first order in @xmath11 .",
    "the embedding potential gives the generalised logarithmic derivative over @xmath5 of the wave - function in region ii,@xcite @xmath12 and this ensures that @xmath13 in region i matches correctly in amplitude and derivative on to the solution in ii . in three - dimensional applications ,",
    "we find @xmath8 from the green function for region ii satisfying the zero - derivative boundary condition on @xmath5.@xcite however , in the one - dimensional application described in this paper , we use eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] to find the embedding potential  in one - dimension , this becomes a relation between amplitude and derivative at the point between regions i and ii .",
    "as the use of @xmath8 suggests , the embedding potential is a form of self - energy , an energy - dependent , possibly complex potential added on to the hamiltonian to replace a region of phase space or hilbert space . in fact the embedding potential in the linear combination of atomic orbitals formalism @xcite is usually called the self - energy , often in connection with conduction through linear molecules attached at each end to metallic contacts.@xcite the contacts and associated electron reservoirs are replaced in the tight - binding hamiltonian of the system by self - energies ( embedding potentials in tight - binding guise).@xcite in our embedding method , in which space is partitioned , we can use any convenient basis set for expanding the wave - function or green function in region i.    we now briefly describe the structure of this paper . in section ii we shall use solutions of the schrdinger equation in one unit cell to calculate the complex band structure , which describes the allowed solutions for the semi - infinite crystal at energy @xmath10 , and the logarithmic derivative of these solutions , hence the embedding potential @xmath14 .",
    "related results have been derived by butti,@xcite using a different method , and his expression for the one - dimensional embedding potential was used in a recent analysis of electron spectroscopies from adsorbates.@xcite the result for the band structure has previously been derived by kohn,@xcite and with particular reference to the sinusoidal potential ( the mathieu problem ) , by mclachlan.@xcite the expressions are remarkably simple , and the band structure formula in particular may be useful in teaching , where one - dimensional potentials such as the kronig - penney model frequently serve as an introduction to band theory.@xcite in section iii we shall illustrate the use of the embedding potential in a calculation of the density of states at the al(001 ) surface using the one - dimensional model potential of chulkov _",
    "et al_.@xcite the expression for the embedding potential of a one - dimensional crystal is useful not only in the energy domain , but we are also using it in fourier transform ( with an extra factor of @xmath15)@xcite to study time - dependent processes at surfaces , such as electron emission .",
    "atomic units are used in this paper , with @xmath16 .",
    "our starting point for finding the band structure and embedding potential is the green function formula for the wave - function @xmath17 in some interval in terms of the derivatives at the ends of the range , @xmath18 , \\;\\;0\\le z\\le a,\\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where we take the range to be the unit cell between @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the infinite one - dimensional crystal ; @xmath21 is the green function with zero - derivative boundary conditions at the ends of the unit cell .",
    "this formula is analogous to the equation in electrostatics giving the potential inside some region of space in terms of the boundary values of the electric field,@xcite and can be derived in exactly the same way .",
    "this equation satisfied by the wave - function within the unit cell does not depend on @xmath17 in the rest of the crystal , but we now impose the bloch form of wave - function . evaluating @xmath13 at @xmath19 , eq .",
