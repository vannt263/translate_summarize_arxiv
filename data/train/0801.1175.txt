    "hastings et al@xcite described several advantages of using a magnetic gradiometer to directly measure magnetic gradients in space . in their paper , some cryogenically cooled squid - based magnetic gradiometer designs have been considered .",
    "squid - based magnetic gradiometers are currently under development mainly for airborne geophysical reconnaissance purposes @xcite@xcite . on their own",
    ", squid gradiometers provide a very high sensitivity to magnetic gradients in the laboratory environment@xcite , and require some additional auxiliary equipment and a compensation technique when deployed from a moving platform@xcite .",
    "due to logistical difficulties , the use of squids in space has been limited until recently@xcite@xcite .",
    "many fluxgate magnetometers have been previously used in space with sensitivities ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6@xcite .",
    "they do not require any cryogenic environment , and fall into a medium range on the sensitivity scale compared to the squid - based magnetometers .",
    "in the past few years , fluxgate gradiometers have been proposed for space missions .",
    "the best performance reported to date is @xmath7 in the band @xmath8 to @xmath9@xcite .",
    "recently , a novel direct string magnetic gradiometer ( dsmg ) has been developed@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it consists of a single aluminium 6061 alloy string or wire ( i.e. an object with transverse dimensions much smaller than its longitudinal dimension ) .",
    "the string is held under tension with its second harmonic oscillation mode at @xmath10 .",
    "an ac current tuned to the second harmonic is used to drive the string .",
    "this sets the string into a resonant motion due to the ampere force per unit length :    @xmath11\\mbox{sin}(\\omega t)\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is a unit vector along the z direction chosen to point along the string s length , @xmath13 is the amplitude of the ac drive current , @xmath14 is the string s drive angular frequency and @xmath15 is the magnetic induction vector .    when the string is a stretched thin flat ribbon@xcite , the resonant motion is strictly one - dimensional with its sensitivity axis pointing perpendicular to the plane of motion . in this case",

    "the upper clamp point determines the ribbon s length @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the amplitude of a n - mode mechanical displacement of the ribbon from its unperturbed position aligned with z axis .",
    "it is also assumed that all non - linear terms can be ignored as , in fact , the maximum possible mechanical displacements do not exceed the nanometer scale@xcite . in eq .",

    "it has the following correlation function in the white noise area@xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath24 is absolute temperature .    as it follows from eq .",
    "[ alexeyeqn ] , the magnetic gradient term of the driving force is coupled only to even resonant modes , while the conventional magnetic field term is coupled to the odd ones .    during operation",
    "the string oscillator is an integral part of a dynamic feedback loop@xcite .",
    "the dynamic properties of such a complex system are different from those of a stand - alone mechanical oscillator described in previous work@xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a number of additional parameters that can play a crucial role in creating an optimised dsmg with a possibility to implement effective noise suppressing algorithms , such as electronic cooling@xcite and pulse feedback modulation technique@xcite .    by its very nature",
    ", dsmg is a modulation - demodulation device . like fluxgate magnetic gradiometers",
    ", it is capable of detecting the quasi dc magnetic gradients both in relative and in absolute units .",
    "the detection method provides strong immunity to the uniform magnetic field .",
    "firstly the ac drive current does not couple strongly to the uniform field .",
    "the second harmonic drive frequency naturally couples to the magnetic gradient but is well off the drive frequency that couples to the uniform magnetic field .",
    "secondly , the mechanical displacement detection is designed to preferentially detect the second harmonic oscillations and suppress the fundamental mode oscillations",
    ". a common mode rejection ratio of the order of @xmath25 is naturally achieved without any balancing technique .",
    "the mechanical q factor of the ribbon provides first stage amplification of the signal to the level where an instrumental read - out noise is lower than the fundamental thermal noise of the ribbon .",
    "the latter determines the fundamental rms noise floor of a dsmg@xcite :    @xmath26    where , for the current dsmg design , @xmath27 is the length of the ribbon , @xmath28 is the mass per unit length , @xmath29 is the relaxation time at a pressure of @xmath0 , @xmath30 is the measurement time and @xmath31 is the effective noise temperature .",

    "the achieved sensitivity is @xmath34 in an unshielded environment in the band @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "below we consider some possible ways of greatly reducing the dsmg s thermal noise limiting factor by using some advantages of the natural space - borne environment .",
    "we show that a dsmg specifically designed for space - borne applications can be as sensitive as squid - based devices without the requirement of using cryogenic equipment . also , by their nature , dsmgs should exhibit a very low @xmath35 noise , allowing measurements within the @xmath36 to @xmath37 band specified by hastings et al@xcite .",
    "during deployment in space , the dsmg would operate at pressures between @xmath38 at an altitude of @xmath39@xcite and @xmath40 on the moon@xcite .",
    "this means that despite the large surface area to mass ratio of the ribbon , gas friction damping is negligible .",
    "measurements of the intrinsic mechanical @xmath41 factor of aluminium 6061-t6511 by duffy@xcite with a cylinder of diameter 6 mm give @xmath41 factors as high as @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "increasing the @xmath41 factor of the ribbon is one way to reduce thermal noise .",
    "the aluminium ribbon is strained and clamped at both ends .",
    "initially the amount of stress in tension is proportional to the amount of strain .",
    "the tension sets the resonant frequency of the magnetic gradiometer .",
    "low levels of stress relaxation are desirable to ensure a long operating life for the dsmg .",
    "table [ stress ] shows that annealed aluminium is not a viable material for the ribbon due to excessive levels of stress relaxation .    for space deployment",
    "it is proposed to use a wide thin ribbon .",
    "this would maximise the surface area available for thermal radiation which would allow a higher current to be pumped along the ribbon and yet minimise the mass per unit length .",

    "preliminary experiments by the authors on aluminum 6061 with a ribbon of width @xmath50 and thickness @xmath51 in a vacuum of @xmath52 have measured a ribbon q factor of @xmath53 .",

    "the width of @xmath73 and length of @xmath74 are the maximum dimensions that are feasible for a magnetic gradiometer deployed in space .",
    "the dsmg system also requires supporting mechanical structure and electronics so the dimensions of the entire gradiometer are approximately @xmath75 .",

    "extrapolating the results of the preliminary experiment , the increased length of @xmath74 should allow a ribbon @xmath41 factor of the order @xmath80 ( q varies as the length of the ribbon squared ) .",
    "the relaxation time would then be approximately @xmath81 which is much greater than its current value of @xmath82 .",

    "the reduction of vibration noise by 9 orders of magnitude more than compensates for the greater vibration at lower frequencies .",
    "no vibration isolation is required for the proposed dsmg .",
    "the high current pumped through the ribbon used to detect gradients generates a significant amount of heat . in a high vacuum",
    "the dominant method of dissipating this heat is thermal radiation .",
    "table [ stress ] shows that if the ribbon is allowed to heat up to @xmath88 then the amount of stress relaxation becomes unacceptable .",
