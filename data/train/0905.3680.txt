    "for today , the standard model is proved with a convincing variety of experiments . however , this theory can not shed light on some essential aspects of our understanding of the nature , which still remain obscure and are of great interest . among them",
    "is the _ quantum gravity _ , which is believed to play a major role at the _ planck scale of energies _",
    "( @xmath0gev ) .",
    "the standard model fails to incorporate the general relativity at the quantum level , since the quantization methods adopted in the former theory lead to a nonrenormalizable quantum gravity in this case .",
    "such theory is unacceptable as a fundamental theory . at the same time , there exist some candidates for such fundamental theory , string theories , for instance , taking the form of the standard model and the general relativity in appropriate low - energy limits . thus searching for signatures of the planck - scale physics at experimentally attainable energies would be a natural way to choose between these candidate theories , to constrain their parameters , and to clarify the essence of the quantum gravity .",
    "planck energies being far from experimental attainment , the _ standard model extension ( sme ) _ was elaborated .",
    "it is an effective theory ( applicable at the energies @xmath1 ) formulated axiomatically as a set of corrections to the lagrangian of the standard model , which fulfill some `` natural '' requirements @xcite , such as _ observer lorentz invariance , 4-momentum conservation , unitarity , and microcausality_. in what follows , we will focus on a subset of the sme referred to as the _ minimal _ sme in _ flat _ minkowsky spacetime , in which local @xmath2 gauge invariance and power - counting renormalizability are also required .",
    "a spectacular feature of such requirements is that they reduce the diversity of possible correction terms down to a _",
    "finite _ number of them .",
    "each of them consists of a complex ( pseudo)tensor constant ( sme coupling ) contracted with conventional standard model fields and their spacetime derivatives .",
    "these constants are believed to stand for vacuum expectation values of the fields featuring in the hypothetic lorentz - covariant fundamental theory and condensed at low energies due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that such lorentz symmetry breaking can occur in some theories beyond the standard model @xcite , leading subsequently to the sme .",
    "the sme can thus be used to reduce the complexity of these theories and related calculations in the low - energy limit .",
    "it also provides a standard for representation of the data obtained in experiments searching for lorentz violation .",
    "recently , a number of theoretical researches has been performed aimed at investigating the vacuum structure of this model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and to study the assumed lorentz violation on various high - energy processes @xcite .",
    "such effects as the vacuum photon splitting , vacuum birefringence , and vacuum cherenkov radiation were studied .",
    "the effect of lorentz violation on the synchrotron radiation @xcite and the atomic spectrum and radiation properties @xcite were also analyzed . as a result of such theoretical investigations and subsequent precise experimental tests ,",
    "the new constraints on lorentz violation were placed .    on the other hand , even in the conventional standard model",
    ", the quantum structure of the vacuum manifests itself in such effects as the casimir effect @xcite , that have been directly observed .",
    "this effect has been studied thoroughly within the standard model , including different approaches @xcite ( various regularization schemes , the calculations via the dyadic green function and the vacuum energy ) , setups ( two parallel plates , a sphere , a plate and a sphere ; non - perfect conductor plates , finite temperature , fermion casimir effect , etc . ) .",
    "the so - called _ maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) electrodynamics _ in @xmath3 dimensions was also considered in this concern @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect was also studied within the context of extra dimensions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and curved space @xcite .",
    "some attention was paid to this problem within the sme , namely , within extended quantum electrodynamics ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mcsqed ] ) @xcite , which , in a certain particular case , takes the form quite analogous to the mcs electrodynamics .",
    "although the original version of casimir effect concerned electromagnetic field , this effect is much more general .",
    "it can be defined as the stress ( force per unit area ) on the bounding surfaces when a quantum field is confined within a finite volume of space .",
    "the boundaries can be material media and also the interfaces between different phases of the vacuum or topologies of space .    in our investigation , we focus on the extended electrodynamics , in order to find the signature of the lorentz violation in the electromagnetic casimir effect .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcsqed ] , we analyze the pure - photon sector of a particular case of the sme , namely , of the @xmath4-dimensional maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics , in order to obtain the expression for the vacuum energy within this theory .",
    "we prove directly that the casimir force in such a theory remains gauge - invariant although the energy - momentum tensor does not . in sec .",
    "[ sec : photoneigenstates ] , we focus on finding the eigenstates and the energy spectrum of the photon between the two parallel perfectly conducting plates within the mcs electrodynamics . the one - photon energy spectrum , which follows from the implicit expression found in sec .",
    "[ sec : photoneigenstates ] , is then analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrumnotes ] , where we show that when the plates are close enough to each other , the imaginary - energy ( tachyonic ) states are negligibly few , so the instability of the theory is also negligible ( see assertion [ finalassertion ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zetareg ] , using approximate energy eigenvalues , we find the leading correction to the zeta function corresponding to the one - photon energy - squared operator , and , in turn , the leading correction to the casimir energy . the contribution of the `` quasi - zero '' modes , which become trivial in the maxwell case , to the casimir force , is also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : residuetheorem ] , we use the strict approach based on the residue theorem @xcite to explicitly sum the vacuum energy series , which contains the zeros of the transcendental function .",
    "we then renormalize the resulting complex plane integral and find the exact convergent expression for the real part of the casimir energy .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the results obtained , and we discuss the constraints they place on the parameters of the lorentz violation .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry is broken within the minimal sme , the extended quantum electrodynamics arises @xcite . for one fermion generation , it contains 10 additional ( tensor ) coupling constants which introduce the interaction between the dirac electron , the photons , and the condensates of planck - scale fields whose nonzero values violate lorentz invariance at low energies : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dual field strength tensor , @xmath7 is the levi - civita symbol , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the @xmath10-covariant derivative , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron mass and charge , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote the dirac matrices , while spacetime indices @xmath16 . for the lorentz - violating couplings to be unambiguously defined",
    ", they should be real traceless tensors with certain symmetry properties , such as @xmath17 .",
    "it should be stressed that the theory remains _ observer - lorentz - invariant _ , since the coupling constants are tensors under the boosts and rotations of the reference frame .",
    "this means that the lagrangian is a scalar , and physics in different reference frames is equivalent though not the same , because the values of the components of the coupling constants depend on the choice of the frame .",
    "nevertheless , these components in different frames also differ by the lorentz transformation , hence , if one takes the latter one into account , physics in different reference frames becomes fully lorentz - covariant .    in a fixed reference frame",
    ", however , the existence of the lorentz violation affects , e.g. , how the energy value of a free particle depends on its momentum , in such a way that its energy - momentum vector is no more a 4-vector under rotations and boosts of the _ momentum _",
    "( _ active _ lorentz transformations ) . in other words , extended electrodynamics , as well as the sme itself , is a theory with broken _ particle _ lorentz invariance and preserved _ observer _ lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "most of the lorentz - violating couplings are tightly constrained ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) ; some of them can be excluded from the theory using certain unitary transformations , e.g. , @xmath18 vanishes if we make a transformation @xmath19 @xcite .    in the present paper , we will study the contribution of the axial vector coupling @xmath20 into the electromagnetic ( i.e. , boson ) casimir effect between the two parallel conducting plates , i.e. , within the theory with the lagrangian @xmath21 the cpt - odd lorentz - violating correction @xmath22 entering the pure - photon sector of the theory has the form of the so - called _ chern - simons ( cs ) term _ @xcite . within the context of electrodynamics , it is also called after carroll , field , and jackiw who have shown that this term can be induced by axions @xcite .",
    "it can also be a manifestation of a nonzero background torsion @xcite .",
    "the theory with lagrangian can be treated as a four - dimensional analogue of the so - called maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) electrodynamics @xcite , which is usually considered in three dimensions and has the following lagrangian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the three - dimensional levi - civita symbol , and @xmath25 . due to this analogy",
    ", we will refer to the former theory as to the _ four - dimensional maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics_. in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , the cs term does not violate lorentz invariance , since @xmath26 is a pseudoscalar , and , when it is present , the free electromagnetic field @xmath27 satisfies the klein - gordon equation with a nonzero mass equal to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , the gauge invariance , which is typically absent for massive gauge fields , survives for nonzero @xmath26 , since the chern - simons term is changes by a total derivative under gauge transformations .",
    "the chern - simons term within ( 3 + 1)-dimensional electrodynamics has slightly different properties .",
    "it does also change by a total derivative under @xmath10 gauge transformations , and the action remains gauge - invariant ( if appropriate boundary conditions are fulfilled ) : @xmath29 however , first , the coupling constant @xmath20 is a _ pseudovector _ , and thus violates lorentz invariance . in particular , it can cause a spatial anisotropy of the theory .",
    "second , if @xmath30 , the theory can become unstable @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrumnotes ] , and now we will consider the 4-dimensional mcs electrodynamics in more detail .    varying the action @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34",
    ", we obtain the equations of motion @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fermion current , and the left arrow over @xmath37 indicates that it acts upon @xmath34 , i.e. , to the left .",
    "as it can be seen from , the potential - current interaction has the conventional form @xmath38 typical for the maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "we therefore can resort to the pure - photon sector of the mcs electrodynamics for our consideration of the _ boson _ casimir effect .",
    "the corresponding canonical energy - momentum tensor , which follows from the pure - gauge terms in the lagrangian , reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the minkowsky spacetime metric . unlike the conventional ( @xmath41 ) case",

    "@xmath44 becomes symmetric and gauge - invariant in the @xmath41 case .",

    "we will also assume that the plates have the form of large squares denoted @xmath55 , with linear dimensions @xmath56 , and that the potential @xmath57 satisfies the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath58 it can be easily shown , using the method analogous to that adopted in the maxwell electrodynamics @xcite , that the perfect plate conductivity implies the same boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field , as they are in the maxwell electrodynamics , namely , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , is the electric field strength ( we will use the notation @xmath62 , @xmath63 for three - dimensional vectors and denote their indices with latin letters @xmath64 ) . the bianchi identity",
    "@xmath65 implies that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath68 .",
    "first of these equations , taken on the plates , gives @xmath69 for the calculation of the casimir effect , we can not consider the states in which the magnetic field has the static @xmath51-component that does not vanish on the plates ( the corresponding one - photon eigenstates should have zero frequencies , but they , as we will show in , do not contribute to the casimir energy ) . another thing illustrating",
    "this is the fact that zero - frequency fourier components of @xmath70 and @xmath67 are decoupled in the free mcs equations , so the zero - frequency component of the magnetic field is not constrained with the boundary conditions .",
    "this means that this mode does not `` feel '' the plates and therefore does not contribute to the casimir effect . as a result",
    ", we can assume that @xmath71 now it is seen that , for our choice of @xmath20 , the change of the pure - gauge action _ between the plates _ under the gauge transformation vanishes : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , i.e. , the boundary conditions we chose do not violate gauge invariance . of course , in the above expression , the function @xmath74 should be taken @xmath75-periodic as the potential @xmath57 itself .",
    "the expression for the energy - momentum tensor becomes simpler when @xmath20 contains only its timelike component .",
    "of interest are the two following components : @xmath76 the force acting upon the plates is a result of integration of @xmath77 over them , i.e. , over @xmath78 $ ] , and subsequent averaging over the electromagnetic vacuum . to show that this force is gauge - invariant ,",
    "let us prove that @xmath79 vanishes after this integration and averaging .",
    "indeed , one can easily show that @xmath80 the vacuum expectation value of the first term , which is a time derivative , is zero , while the second one vanishes after the integration over @xmath81 due to the periodicity conditions .",
    "hereby , we have proved that the casimir force is gauge - invariant . to find the key expression for it",

    "these states can be described by potential functions @xmath85 satisfying the transversality condition and the equations of motion , which take the following form for these eigenfunctions : @xmath86 these functions should also be periodic in the @xmath81 directions and satisfy the boundary conditions , which imply that @xmath87 since we are not interested in the solutions with @xmath88 which do not contribute to the casimir effect .",

    "note that for every solution @xmath103 of the equations of motion , due to the transversality of the potential , @xmath104 and , after the integration over @xmath105 , the last term , which is a spatial divergence , vanishes due to the boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that @xmath106 where we have used the photon decomposition and the normalization condition .",
    "finally , @xmath107 the series under the derivative operator is obviously divergent , so it needs to be regularized and renormalized .",
    "one possible way to do this is to introduce the _ zeta function _ corresponding to the energy - squared operator @xmath108 that can be extracted from and has the eigenvalues equal to @xmath109 : @xmath110 the value @xmath111 is the analytical continuation of the series , which is convergent for large @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "another possible renormalization method involves subtraction of an expression of the form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 are infinite constants , from the vacuum energy .",
    "@xmath116 is obviously nonphysical , while @xmath117 equals the force acting upon the external side of the plate , i.e. , the casimir force in a semispace , so subtracting it is also physically motivated ( see page ) .",

    "the translational invariance along the @xmath81 directions allows us to search for the solutions having the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the normalization constant .",

    "of course , the periodicity conditions with @xmath56 , which are not invariant under these rotations , do not affect the form of the solutions , but only the normalization coefficient @xmath121 and the possible values of @xmath124 , so that @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
