    "spin dependent transport phenomena in low - dimensional semiconductor structures have been of a lot of interest to the scientific community in recent years due to the potential applications in the highly emerging field of spintronics.@xcite intense research in this field was initiated after the proposal of spin field effect transistor by datta and das @xcite .",
    "the principal aim of this field is to produce pure spin current and its manipulation on semiconductor nanostructure devices .",
    "one important tool for generating pure spin current is the well known spin hall effect ( she ) .",
    "@xcite in she spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) leads to a generation of spin current from an external electric voltage . for the happening of she , the charge carriers are either electrons in the conduction band or holes in the valence band in a iii - v semiconductor such as gaas",
    "many @xmath1-doped semiconductors such as gaas , insb , si etc show four - fold degeneracy in their valence band around the @xmath2 point .",
    "this kind of systems is described by @xmath3 luttinger@xcite hamiltonian .",
    "the luttinger hamiltonian leads to two two - fold degenerate energy branches having different effective masses .",
    "these two dispersion branches are known as the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands which are described by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . for spin - orbit",
    "coupled two - dimensional hole system ( 2dhs ) in a narrow quantum well , the @xmath3 luttinger hamiltonian can be projected onto @xmath6 hh states giving rise to an effective @xmath7 rashba hamiltonian@xcite provided that the hole density is sufficiently low . in 2dhs",
    "the rashba soi is tri - linear in momentum .    in recent years",
    "an oscillatory quantum motion , called @xmath0 ( zb ) , has become a central point of research interest in various low - dimensional semiconducting systems .",
    "the length and time scales corresponding to this trembling motion in vacuum are of the order of the compton wavelength @xmath8 nm and @xmath9 s , respectively . due to this ultra small length and time scale ,",
    "it has not been possible to make an experimental verification of zb phenomenon in vacuum so far .",
    "however an intense interest was initiated around 2005 by zawadzki@xcite who has drawn an analogy between the dirac equation of a free dirac electron and the @xmath10 theory of the band structure of a narrow gap semiconductor .",
    "he was able to find out a new length scale @xmath11 nm which is much larger than @xmath12 .",
    "later , the problem of zb of electrons and holes in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells in the presence of spin - orbit interaction was studied by schliemann@xcite et .",
    "these pioneering works initiated tremendous motivation for theoretical studies in search of zb in various condensed matter systems such as crystalline solid,@xcite graphene,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite luttinger liquid,@xcite superconductor,@xcite ultra - cold atom,@xcite topological insulators @xcite etc .",
    "it was also reported that the origin of the minimal conductivity @xcite in graphene can be explained in the light of the peculiar phenomenon zb .",
    "recently , a general theory for zb has been developed by david and cserti.@xcite winkler@xcite et .",
    "al . considered a number of effective hamiltonians representing different systems and studied various consequences of zb oscillations .",
    "the effect of an in - plane magnetic field on the zb oscillations in a rashba - dresselhaus system has been studied.@xcite very recently , a complex quantum motion known as `` super zitterbewegung '' in graphene has been studied@xcite theoretically using time - dependent two - band hamiltonian in the framework of rotating wave approximation .    although the zb phenomenon in vacuum is not yet observed experimentally , however an optical and acoustic analog of relativistic zb",
    "have been observed experimentally in optical super - lattice@xcite and in a two - dimensional sonic crystal@xcite , respectively .",
    "also simulation@xcite of dirac particles has been performed recently using trapped ions and laser excitations .",
    "most recently , the zb in @xmath13rb bose - einstein condensate is observed experimentally @xcite using direct imaging technique .    in this work",
    "we consider the long standing problem of zb of heavy holes with cubic rashba interaction in a iii - v semiconductor quantum well subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we study time - evolution of a heavy hole represented by the gaussian wave packet .",
    "we visualize and discuss how the hole wave packet evolves with time around the cyclotron orbit .",
    "it is shown that as time goes on , the initial wave packet starts to diffuse asymmetrically along the cyclotron orbit while executing cyclotron motion . at a later time , depending on the spin - orbit strength , the wave packet splits into two peaks with unequal amplitudes .",
    "after many more cycles , the wave packet diffuses entirely along the cyclotron orbit .",
    "then interference occurs between tail and head of the diffused wave packet , which randomizes the wave packet along the entire cyclotron orbit .",
    "the zb of heavy holes in various physical quantities , such as position , charge current and spin angular momentum , are studied analytically as well as numerically .",
    "it is revealed that the zb in these observables are very much dependent on the initial wave vector of the gaussian wave packet and the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we present all relevant theoretical details such as the hamiltonian , landau levels , its corresponding eigenfunction and time - evolution of initial hole wave packet using green s function approach as well as average values of various physical observables . numerical results and discussion",
    "are given in section iii .",
    "we summarize our findings in section iv .",

    "the dynamics of holes in the @xmath14 valence band of iii - v semiconductors with zinc - blende structure like gaas are well described within the framework of the luttinger model ( lm ) . in the spherical approximation@xcite of lm ,",
    "the topmost valence band is four fold degenerate at the @xmath2 point with hh and lh bands corresponding to total spin @xmath15 .",
    "strong quantum confinement in the semiconductor heterostructure along the growth direction removes the @xmath2 point degeneracy between the hh and lh bands . at very low temperature and low density",
    "only the hh subbands are assumed to be occupied .",
    "now , it is possible to obtain a @xmath16-cubic rashba hamiltonian from the luttinger hamiltonian by projecting the latter onto the hh states .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the rashba spin - splitting for hh and lh bands are proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the linear spin - splitting for lhs is similar to that for electrons.@xcite our present study mainly deals with only hhs and hence linear spin - splitting for electrons and lhs is completely ignored .    in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    "the single particle hamiltonian @xcite of a 2dhs with rashba soi ( rsoi ) can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 is the canonical momentum operator , @xmath21 is the vector potential corresponding to the external magnetic field @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the effective mass of the heavy hole , @xmath25 is the rashba coupling coefficient and @xmath26 s are the pauli matrices .",
    "also , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the effective lande g - factor .",
    "one important point to be mentioned here that the pauli matrices represent an effective pseudo - spin with spin projection @xmath30 along the growth direction of the quantum well .    for convenience , we assume @xmath31 and the corresponding vector potential in the landau gauge as @xmath32 . the hamiltonian @xmath33 in eq .",
