    "at the level of examples , current - algebraic conformal field theory [ 1,2 ] and orbifold theory [ 3 - 8 ] are almost as old as string theory itself [ 9 - 12 ] .",
    "it is only in the last few years however that the orbifold program [ 13 - 23,24 - 27 ] has in large part completed the local description of the general closed- and open - string orbifold conformal field theory .",
    "[ 22,28 ] for short reviews of the orbifold program and related recent developments in orbifold theory .",
    "extending the results of the orbifold program , i have recently proposed [ 28 - 31 ] that the _ orbifolds of permutation - type _ define generically - new physical open- and closed - string systems at multiples of conventional critical central charges .",
    "the simplest examples of these systems are the free - bosonic cases at @xmath4 , for which we have so far studied the following topics :    i. the extended action formulations of the twisted sectors of these orbifolds , which show _ new permutation - twisted world - sheet gravities _ [ 28 ] .",
    "the extended diffeomorphism invariances and extended , twisted virasoro constraints of these actions indicate that , as string theories , the orbifolds of permutation - type can be free of negative - norm states .",

    "this analysis provides further evidence that the orbifold - string systems of permutation - type can be free of negative - norm states , and moreover shows that a few of the simplest ( half - integer moded ) open and closed @xmath6 strings have the same spectra as ordinary untwisted @xmath3 strings . beyond these simple cases , the twisted @xmath6 strings are apparently new .",
    "_ orientation orbifolds include orientifolds _ [ 27 ] .",
    "the orientation - orbifold string systems [ 28 - 30 ] involve dividing the closed string by automorphism groups which contain world - sheet orientation - reversing automorphisms .",
    "they therefore contain an equal number of generically - twisted closed- and open - string sectors , each of the latter at @xmath6 . in this fourth paper of the series",
    ", twisted tree diagrams are constructed to study a particular example with a single half - integer moded open - string sector , and evaluation of the trees confirms [ 30 ] at the interacting level that this orientation - orbifold system is nothing but the archetypal orientifold in disguise .",
    "there are many other free - bosonic orientation orbifolds ( with higher fractional modeing ) which are not equivalent [ 29 ] to conventional orientifolds , but these `` generalized orientifolds '' have not yet been studied at the interacting level .    in this fifth paper of the series , i return to the closed - string permutation orbifolds at central charge @xmath4 , whose general form    @xmath7    includes the uniform action of automorphisms @xmath8 on each untwisted closed - string copy @xmath9 . for simplicity , the discussion of these orbifolds is continued here only for the case of continuous ( decompactified ) zero modes , but this can be straightforwardly generalized .",

    "2 ) for these orbifolds which confirm at the interacting level for all prime @xmath1 our earlier conclusion [ 30 ] for the free theory at @xmath15 : the physical spectrum of each of the @xmath16 twisted sectors of @xmath17 is equivalent to that of an ordinary untwisted @xmath3 string . as emphasized in refs .",
    "[ 30,31 ] , this so - called _ spectral equivalence _ holds _ only _ for the string amplitudes , which involve extra integrations over the correlators of the orbifold cft s .    sewing the twisted trees gives an integrated form of the standard [ 7 ] twisted contribution to the orbifold partition function , and the following formal integration identity ( see eq .",

    "@xmath20 is the partition function of the ordinary untwisted closed string @xmath9 , and @xmath21 is the _ naive _ integration range encountered in the _ naive ( operator ) sewing _ [ 31,9 ] of any string loop .",

    "the particle - theoretic contributions of the untwisted sector are surprisingly more difficult to understand : i had expected to find included here the non - linear untwisted contribution @xmath22 of the standard orbifold partition function [ 6 ] , but in fact ( see subsec .",

    ". 5 and 6 finally assemble our observations about the twisted and untwisted loop contributions .",
    "the central point here is that the formal integration identities ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) generate certain _ ambiguities _ in the naive or particle - theoretic form of the loops , which persist in the corresponding modular - invariant forms .",

    "other interesting special cases are discussed in subsec .",
    "5.2 but , since all values of @xmath25 are formally associated to the _ same _ naive sewing of the trees , the entire @xmath25-family should be further tested against other string- and conformal - field - theoretic intuitions .    in this connection ,",

    "this property is also noted in the appendix , where the tree amplitudes of the vertex @xmath301 are evaluated in terms of the ordinary closed - string trees .",
    "i have explicitly checked the twisted contribution of eq .",
    "( 6.7 ) to eq .",
    "( 6.8 ) only for the case @xmath118 , but the result is certainly correct for all prime @xmath1 because eq .",
    "( 6.9a ) shows that the trace - evaluated contribution of each twisted sector is equivalent to that of an ordinary closed string .",
    "thanks to the specific choice of emission vertices in eq .",
    "( 6.7 ) , the reader will note that ( up to a scale ) all these trace - evaluated particle - theoretic results can be obtained by the simple map @xmath302 from the corresponding results above for the orbifold cosmological constant .",
    "it is then straightforward to write down the loop analogues of eqs .",
    "( 5.3 ) and ( 5.4 ) and divide by @xmath160 to obtain the final result in eq . ( 6.1 ) for the physical loops with a cosmological kernel .",
    "the orbifold - string loops ( 6.1 ) with a cosmological kernel were easy to understand in analogy with the orbifold cosmological constant but , as mentioned above , one can also construct modified orbifold loops which do not have a cosmological kernel when @xmath287 .",
    "i find it instructive to consider this topic first in a broader setting , beginning with the following more general set of manifestly modular - invariant integrals :    @xmath303 \\big\\ }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    @xmath304    in this expression , @xmath282 are the same ordinary , untwisted string densities and the parameter @xmath305 is the same as above , but @xmath306 and @xmath41 are new complex parameters . following the procedure outlined above for the loops with a cosmological kernel , these integrals can in fact be obtained by the map ( 6.10 ) and the corresponding loop - analogues of the spectral - equivalence identities ( 5.3 ) from the following naive form of the integrals @xmath307 in particular , the parameter choice @xmath308 is necessary to obtain the modular - invariant integrands of eq .",
    "( 6.11 ) from the non - invariant integrands of eq .",
    "it is not clear that this naive form is always associated to an operator sewing , but we can be confident in certain cases : in the first place , we find for arbitrary values of the parameters and @xmath232 that both eqs .",
    "( 6.11 ) and ( 6.12 ) reduce to @xmath306 times the ordinary parameter - independent untwisted string loops .",
    "second , we recognize the case @xmath309 as the physical and naive forms respectively of the orbifold - loops with a cosmological kernel ( see eqs .",
    "( 6.1 ) and ( 6.8 ) ) .",
    "another case of particular interest is the parameter choice @xmath310 , which i will call the _ orbifold loops of type @xmath88_. these are the @xmath88-independent loops for n emissions of a representative untwisted tachyon of type @xmath88 :    @xmath311    @xmath312 \\big\\ } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    @xmath313    i have been careful to uniformize this notation  and the depiction of these loops in fig . 4  with the corresponding tree graphs @xmath314 in eq . ( 2.12 ) and fig .",
    "1 . comparing with the trace - evaluated result ( 6.8 ) for the naive loops with a cosmological kernel , we see that the internal twisted contribution to eq .",
    "( 6.13a ) is here unchanged  but the kernel of the new loops is _ not cosmological _ for @xmath287 because the first term now shows only the contribution of a _ single _ untwisted internal closed string .",
    "the trace form of the naive loops @xmath315 is then simply obtained by substitution of the type-@xmath88 emission vertices ( see eqs . (",
    "2.11 ) , ( 2.12 ) and ( 6.7b ) ) @xmath316 in the trace form ( 6.7a ) of the loop ( and omission of the previously - implied trace over @xmath296 space in the untwisted term ) .",
    "use of the type-@xmath88 emission vertices does not change the internal contribution of the twisted sectors , but restricts the internal untwisted contribution to that of _ type @xmath88 alone _  thereby completing our identification of these loops . because these loops and the corresponding trees of type @xmath88 are independent of @xmath88 , they may be used ( in lieu of moding by permutations of @xmath90 ) at any fixed @xmath88 to describe multiple emissions of a representative tachyon .        in parallel to eqs .",
    "( 5.6 ) and ( 6.4 ) , i finally  mention the simplest case @xmath28 of the physical loops ( 6.13b ) @xmath317 which clearly shows a single ordinary closed - string contribution from the untwisted sector and @xmath89 ordinary contributions from the twisted sectors .",
    "historically , conformal field theory and orbifold theory arose from string theory , and these five papers have outlined my ideas on closing the circle by constructing new physical string systems at higher central charge from the conformal field theory of orbifolds of permutation - type .",
    "many extensions of these ideas are indicated for future work .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "[ 31 ] and the present paper have so far considered only the very simplest of the new orbifold - string systems at the interacting level .",
    "these particular constructions allowed us to study the interacting systems in a context where , as we have seen , the physical spectra of the twisted strings are closely related to untwisted string spectra .",
    "hopefully , these examples will then serve as prototypes for the study of the more general interacting orbifold - string systems of permutation - type , whose spectra are in fact generically - inequivalent [ 30 ] to untwisted systems .",
    "consider for example the _ generalized _ bosonic @xmath258-permutation orbifolds @xmath318 [ 28 - 30 ] with sectors labelled by elements of @xmath319 :    @xmath320    @xmath321    @xmath322    here @xmath323 permutes the two copies of untwisted @xmath9 , and @xmath324 are extra automorphisms of order n which act uniformly on each copy .",
    "the low - order examples given here are easily extended to all n. all the sectors of this set of orbifolds are closed strings at @xmath325 , the entries before and after the semicolon corresponding to untwisted and twisted sectors respectively .",
    "the extended virasoro generators of all twisted open and closed @xmath325 strings were constructed in ref . [",
    "30 ] , and i remind that the @xmath325 string spectra are _ not equivalent _ to untwisted spectra when @xmath8 has elements of order greater than two .",
    "this statement includes the twisted @xmath325 open - string spectra of the general bosonic orientation orbifolds @xmath326 [ 27 - 31 ] .",
    "one may further consider the generalized cyclic permutation orbifolds @xmath327 [ 28,30 ] with @xmath328 at @xmath74 for higher prime @xmath1 , all of whose twisted tree graphs should have the form in eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) with the universal value ( 2.5b ) of the quantity @xmath329 in the twisted propagators .",
    "the twisted vertex operators for these orbifolds can be read as special cases of the general twisted bosonic vertex operators in ref . [",
    "for all these cases , an equivalent but _ unconventionally - twisted _",
    "@xmath3 description of the spectrum is easily written down using a simple variant ( see refs . [ 13,30 ] and subsec .",
    "2.3 ) of the _ orbifold - induction procedure _ with    @xmath330    @xmath331    this map and the unhatted @xmath332 modeing @xmath333 tells us that the physical spectra of these systems are again _ inequivalent _ to untwisted spectra cases unless @xmath334 for all `` h - fractions '' @xmath335 .",
    "( the quantities @xmath336 and @xmath337 are the spectral indices [ 15,17,19,21,28 ] and order respectively of any element @xmath338 of h. )    although i will not give the details here , one can in fact write down a generalized orbifold - induction procedure for every sector of the _ generalized _ permutation orbifold @xmath339 [ 18,19,28 ] at @xmath340 , using a distinct map for each cycle in each element of the general permutation group @xmath341 on k elements . on this basis",
    ", one sees that the physical spectra of these general systems are related to untwisted string spectra _ only _ for the special cases when @xmath342 for all cycle lengths @xmath343 and h - fractions @xmath335 of each sector .",
    "the simple subset of `` ordinary '' permutation orbifolds @xmath224 at @xmath340 satisfy these conditions with @xmath344 , so ( consistent with our work in this paper and in refs .",
    "[ 28 - 30 ] ) the physical spectra of all the corresponding `` ordinary '' permutation - orbifold strings are closely related to untwisted string spectra . beyond these special cases ,",
    "one expects [ 28 - 31 ] the vast majority of generalized permutation orbifolds to describe a great variety of new orbifold - string theories , yet to be studied at the interacting level .",
    "other directions , including partial orbifoldizations , partial compactifications , twisted b fields and the corresponding extensions to the superstring orbifolds of permutation - type are sketched in ref . [ 28 ] and the introduction to this paper .",
