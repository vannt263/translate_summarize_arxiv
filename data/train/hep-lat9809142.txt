    "we report on two , high - statistics , quenched lattice calculations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . @xmath0 parametrizes the @xmath4-oscillation contribution to cp - violation in @xmath5 decays ( @xmath6 ) , leading to a hyperbolic constraint on the summit of the unitarity triangle .",
    "@xmath7 are needed to compute the electro - penguin contribution to direct cp - violation ( @xmath8 ) , dominant in the @xmath9 channel . @xmath0 and @xmath7 measure deviation from the vacuum saturation values of the following four - quark , matrix elements : @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and in the chiral limit , @xmath13 @xmath14 where",
    "@xmath15 can be written as @xmath16 if one forbids penguin contractions and where @xmath17 is the corresponding color - mixed operator .",
    "we describe quarks with the mean - field - improved , sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) action @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 and where @xmath21 is the wilson fermion action , @xmath22 , the bare gauge coupling , @xmath23 , a lattice definition of the field - strength tensor and @xmath24 , the appropriate quark hopping parameter .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are summarized in .",
    "we further perform full tadpole - improved , klm rotation of quark fields .",

    "while the matching of quark bilinears is simple , the use of wilson fermions induces mixing amongst four - quark operators of different chirality . to describe this mixing , we use the following complete basis of parity - conserving operators : @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "then , the matching can be written , with identifications that will be clarified by what follows , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in terms of the chirally subtracted operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 , i=2,4 .",
    "we perform matching to the @xmath37-ndr scheme at one loop .",
    "since the clover term is @xmath38 , we can use the tree - level - clover - action results of @xcite with modifications appropriate for tadpole - improvement and klm normalization . for the coupling ,",
    "we choose @xmath39 defined from the plaquette  @xcite , identifying the scale @xmath40 with that of the matching . to estimate the systematic error associated with our procedure , we vary @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 .",
    "to obtain the desired @xmath25-parameters , we consider ratios of 3-point to two 2-point functions . in the limit that the three points are well separated in time , these ratios reduce to : r_f=2 & & + r_7 ^ 3/2 & & - [ eq : ratdefs ] + r_8 ^ 3/2 & & , where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 pseudoscalar meson .",
    "we calculate the ratios for the momenta @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and for all hopping parameter pairs taken from .    to study their chiral behavior , we follow @xcite and define the mass and recoil variables x & = & + y & = & x. [ eq : xydef ] we then fit the ratios to r(x , y ) = a_00+a_10x+a_01y+[eq : rxy ]  , where we neglect both chiral logarithms , which are difficult to resolve numerically , and @xmath48 breaking terms , which appear to be small for the quark masses we consider .      at @xmath53 we further find that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are very small and consistent with zero , as chiral symmetry requires , and remain so as @xmath40 is increased up to @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 should thus give a reliable estimate of @xmath0 . at @xmath3 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are less than 3 and @xmath58 away from zero and smaller than the values obtained in @xcite with a tree - level sw action and boosted , one - loop matching .",
    "taken in conjunction with these and other wilson results obtained from less improved actions , our preliminary findings suggest that discretization errors represent an important part of the traditionally observed residual chiral violations ( please see @xcite and @xcite for further discussion ) .    in the chiral limit , @xmath7 correspond to the leading term , @xmath54 , in the expansion of and the study of the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath59 is less important .",
    "therefore , we consider only the @xmath60 ratios so as not to introduce potential momentum - dependent discretization errors .",
    "we find that the description of the chiral behavior of @xmath59 requires a quadratic term in @xmath50 .    to compare results for @xmath0 and @xmath7 obtained at different @xmath40 and/or @xmath26",
    ", we must run them to a common reference scale which we take to be @xmath61 .",
    "running is performed at two loops with @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath83-dependence is also found to be small though it can not be excluded given the statistical errors and the small deviations of @xmath54 and @xmath55 from zero at 6.0 .",
    "two values of the lattice spacing are not sufficient for a proper continuum - limit extrapolation and we quote as our preliminary result for @xmath0 the @xmath52 number at @xmath53 , with the comment that residual discretization errors may be small .",
    "the @xmath40-dependence of @xmath2 and especially @xmath1 is significantly stronger than that of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a result of the rather large matching constants and anomalous dimensions .",
