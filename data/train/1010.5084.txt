    "atmospheric muons and neutrinos are produced in the showers of high energy cosmic rays in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "neutrinos can change flavor during their travel from the creation to the detection points , and therefore the observation of their fluxes allows to study their masses , mixings and interactions . above a minimum energy of a few gev muons reach the ground , where they can also be observed .",
    "measurements of the atmospheric muon flux provide information about the primary cosmic ray fluxes and about the properties of high - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "moreover , the measurements of the atmospheric muons can be used to obtain precise estimates of the fluxes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ before _ flavor oscillation effects .",
    "in fact , these measurements have played an important role for the interpretation of the data and the determination of the flavor oscillation parameters .",
    "the dominant source of muons and muon neutrinos is the weak decay of charged pions and kaons .",
    "these decays always produce @xmath16 or @xmath17 pairs , implying a correlation between charged - lepton and neutrino fluxes that can be robustly predicted .",
    "an important goal of present and future experiments is the detection of high - energy neutrinos produced in galactic and extragalactic astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "neutrinos propagate without significant losses ( excluding the cosmological redshift ) from very distant sources , and one of largest expected signals is an isotropic diffuse flux generated by the ensemble of all extragalactic sources in the universe . for neutrino astronomy , therefore , the atmospheric neutrino fluxes constitute a disturbing background that must be subtracted from the signal . measurements of the muon flux can help in the determination of this background .    at very high energy it is possible , and indeed virtually certain , that the decay of charged pions and kaons does not remain the dominant source of atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "the reason is that these particles are relatively long lived and , because of the lorentz time dilatation , their decay probability at high energy is strongly suppressed . as an illustration ,",
    "the decay length of a 10  tev charged pion is more that 500  km , around 100 times larger than its interaction length in air .",
    "the contribution of particles with a shorter lifetime is therefore likely to become dominant . in particular ,",
    "the contribution of charmed hadrons is a natural candidate .",
    "these particles have large ( @xmath18% ) branching ratios into semileptonic modes and a lifetime @xmath19  s , implying a decay probability of order 1 up to energies around @xmath20  gev .",
    "recently , however , it has been suggested @xcite that the dominant source of atmospheric muons of very large energy could be the electromagnetic decay of unflavored mesons into @xmath21 pairs .",
    "these mesons are particles of type @xmath22 , constituted by a quark and an anti  quark of the same flavor . neglecting heavy quarks",
    "one has 3 scalar ( @xmath23 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and three vector ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) mesons of this kind .",
    "they decay mostly into pions and photons via strong or electromagnetic interactions with a very short lifetime .",
    "all of them except the neutral pion ( which is below threshold ) can decay into a @xmath21 pair , sometimes together with a photon or a neutral pion ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , with small branching ratios of order @xmath9 .",
    "these rare decay modes have been neglected in essentially all calculations of atmospheric muons . however ,",
    "if the multiplicities and the energy spectra of charged pions and unflavored mesons are roughly similar , then they will become the dominant source of atmospheric muons when the average decay probability of charged pions is suppressed by a factor ( @xmath26 ) of the same order as the branching ratios into the rare modes that contain muons .    in this article",
    "we do a critical review of the different contributions to the lepton fluxes at high energies . in section 3 we estimate the conventional lepton fluxes using the so called @xmath1moment method , that provides simple analytic expressions .",
    "then we focus on the contribution to the muon flux from the decay of unflavored mesons . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we evaluate , respectively , the contribution from the prompt decay of charmed hadrons and from @xmath27 conversion into a @xmath21 pair .",
    "finally , we summarize the uncertainties and the implications of our results .",
    "the atmospheric flux of a lepton type @xmath28 can be described as the sum of contributions from the decay of different unstable particles : @xmath29 in this equation @xmath30 is the energy and @xmath31 the zenith angle of the lepton , and the summation runs over all possible parent particles . in this work with _",

    "the parent particles that are the source of atmospheric leptons can be naturally divided in three classes .",
    "the first class ( standard contribution ) includes charged pions and kaons that decay via charged - current weak interactions into lepton pairs : ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 and the charge conjugate states .",
    "the observed atmospheric fluxes can at the present time be entirely attributed to this standard contribution .",
    "the second source of atmospheric leptons ( charm contribution ) is the weak decay of particles that contain a charm ( anti)quark",
    ". these decays also generate leptons in @xmath35 and @xmath36 pairs .",
    "in addition , @xmath37 mesons ( scalar mesons with a @xmath38 or @xmath39 quark content ) have a decay branching ratio of @xmath40% into the 2body mode @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ; the subsequent decay of the @xmath43 lepton generates a second tau ( anti)neutrino .",
    "this chain decay process is the main source of atmospheric @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the contribution of charmed particles to the atmospheric lepton fluxes is subdominant and currently undetected .",
    "it is however expected that this mechanism will overtake the standard contribution at sufficiently high energy .",
    "a third class of parent particles can contribute to the flux of atmospheric muons ( but not of neutrinos ) .",
    "this _ unflavored contribution _ is due to the decay of the unflavored mesons @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these particles have small ( order @xmath9 ) branching ratios into final states that include a @xmath21 pair .",
    "the possible significance of this contribution has been discussed in @xcite , and it will be critically analyzed in the following .",
    "muon pairs can also be directly produced in drell ",
    "yan processes and in photon conversions of type @xmath46 .",
    "this last process , despite being suppressed by a factor @xmath47 with respect to the production of @xmath48 pairs , is potentially interesting .",
    "its contribution to the muon atmospheric flux will be indicated as @xmath49 and discussed later .",

    "a potentially interesting source of atmospheric muons is the photon conversion into a pair of muons : @xmath198 where @xmath1 is the electric charge of an air nucleus .",
    "this process is suppressed with respect to the production of @xmath48 pairs by a factor of @xmath199 .",
    "however , high energy showers contain a very large number of photons , and it is not immediately obvious that this contribution to the muon flux is entirely negligible .    to estimate the contribution of photon conversions into @xmath21 pairs to the atmospheric muon flux it is possible to use the same methods discussed above .",
    "the development of an electromagnetic shower at high energy is controled by the processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production , which are described by the scaling functions @xmath200 with @xmath201 , and @xmath202 with @xmath203 .",

    "( [ eq : num_unflavored ] ) one can see that this contribution to the atmospheric muon flux is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than our estimate from unflavored meson decay .",
    "most predictions of the muon flux from charm decay are also above the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : num_gamma ] ) .",
    "photon conversion into muon pairs is therefore likely to contribute only a small fraction of the atmospheric muon flux even at the highest energies .",
    "in this work we have discussed the main contributions to the atmospheric lepton fluxes at very high energy .",
    "the standard contribution , due to the decay of charged pions and kaons , is suppressed at high energy because most of these long  lived particles interact , and only a small fraction ( inversely proportional to the energy ) decays .",
    "this suppression results in very steep energy spectra for the lepton fluxes , with a slope approximately one unit larger than the one of the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "the zenith angle distributions of these lepton fluxes have also a characteristic shape , that for @xmath31 not too large has the well known @xmath221 form .",
    "summing over particles and anti  particles ( and neglecting neutrino oscillations ) the lepton fluxes from pion and kaon decay are in the ratios : @xmath222 these ratios reflect the fact that charged pions generate only @xmath36 pairs , with the muon taking a larger fraction of the parent particle energy .",
    "the flux ratios have an uncertainty significantly smaller than the absolute value of the fluxes .",
    "the remaining uncertainty is dominated by the error in the estimate of the relative importance of kaon and pion production , and is of order of 15% ( 20% ) for @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the contributions to the lepton fluxes from charm decay are characterized by a zenith angle distribution that is isotropic for energies below @xmath20 gev , and an energy spectrum that roughly follows the primary nucleon spectrum , with corrections related to the energy dependence of the charm production cross sections .",
    "the prediction has however a large uncertainty due to our poor understanding of the dynamics of charmed hadron production .",
    "the ratios between the lepton fluxes can be predicted with a much smaller uncertainty @xmath225    the decay of unflavored mesons generates an isotropic muon flux , that follows closely the shape of the primary cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "montecarlo codes like sibyll of pythia predict that this contribution will overtake the standard contribution ( for the vertical direction ) at an energy @xmath226  gev .",
    "such result reflects that in these montecarlo codes all mesons that compose the scalar and vector su(3 ) nonets are produced with probabilites of the same order ( taking into account a suppression for strange quarks ) .",
    "this implies an abundant production of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , and using the relevant branching ratios one can easily estimate the atmospheric muon flux .",
    "the prediction can therefore be considered as quite robust .",
    "it should be stressed that this flux is larger than most predictions for the charm contribution , and therefore it may be important for future observations .",
    "we have also considered the flux generated by photon conversion into muon pairs .",
    "the muon flux from this source is isotropic and has approximately the same energy spectrum as the flux from the decay of unflavored mesons , but it is approximately 10 times smaller .",
    "photon conversion into muon pairs is therefore likely to be of little phenomenological importance .",
    "it should be stressed that a large uncertainty in the prediction of the lepton fluxes at very high energy arises from our poor knowledge of the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "the relevant energy range is above the cosmic ray knee at @xmath227  gev , where the observations have large errors .",
    "still more important is the fact that the composition of the cosmic ray flux in this energy range is very poorly known .",
    "the prediction of the lepton fluxes depends on the so called nucleon spectrum , @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the flux for the nuclear species of mass number @xmath175 and @xmath118 is the energy per nucleon . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nucleon_flux ] ) the contribution of each nuclear species is weighted by a factor @xmath175 to account for the nucleon multiplicity , and a second factor @xmath175 is in the jacobian for the transformation from total energy to energy per nucleon . if the cosmic ray flux is a power law of exponent @xmath155 the nucleon flux scales with composition @xmath230 .",
    "a heavy composition corresponds then to a smaller nucleon flux , and to smaller lepton fluxes .    for the normalization of the nucleon flux shown in fig .",

    "we have performed an average over the entire down  going hemisphere .",
    "this rough estimates indicate that the contribution to the muon flux from unflavored mesons decay is in principle observable by a neutrino telescope of km@xmath13 .",
    "the most interesting scientific goal of a large neutrino telescopes such as icecube is the detection of astrophysical neutrinos",
    ". the largest signal from astrophysical neutrinos could be the isotropic flux from the ensemble of all extragalactic sources .",
    "the signatures of such an astrophysical neutrino signal are : ( a ) isotropy ; ( b ) a hard energy spectrum ; ( c ) approximately equal fluxes of @xmath195 , @xmath14 and @xmath44 .",
    "the neutrino fluxes generated by charm decay have also the properties ( a ) and ( b ) , and equal fluxes for @xmath195 and @xmath14 , and therefore constitute a dangerous background .",
    "most theoretical models for the production of astrophysical neutrinos predict an energy spectrum harder than what is expected for the charm decay component , however these predictions have important uncertainties    a possible method to separate the astrophysical neutrino signal from the charm decay component is to use measurements of the muon flux to constraint the atmospheric neutrino flux , because charm decay generates approximately equal fluxes of muons , @xmath14 and @xmath195 .",
