    "a recent proposal for a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem replaces the higgs doublet of the electroweak standard model by chiral tensor fields @xcite .",
    "symmetries forbid a local mass term for these chiral tensors .",
    "the chiral couplings between the tensor fields and quarks and leptons are asymptotically free , such that they grow large at a new non - perturbative scale @xmath0 . similar to the confinement scale @xmath1 in strong interactions ,",
    "this scale is exponentially small as compared to the unification scale .",
    "it was advocated that close to the scale @xmath0 a bound state of top - antitop forms , due to the strong attractive interaction mediated by the tensor fields .",
    "if this collective state condenses , the electroweak gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and the w and z bosons as well as the quarks and leptons acquire a mass .",
    "the role of the fundamental higgs doublet in the standard model is taken by the `` composite '' top - antitop condensate @xcite .",
    "first phenomenological studies show no contradiction with present observations @xcite . in particular , the flavour and cp violation is described by the ckm matrix @xcite , as in the standard model .",
    "the free theory for chiral tensor fields is not classically stable .",
    "this raises the question whether a consistent quantum theory can be formulated .",
    "since the free theory is actually on the boundary between stability and instability , the interactions will decide on which side of the `` stability divide '' the interacting theory will be found @xcite .",
    "this question depends crucially on the properties of the ground state - unfortunately a difficult non - perturbative question .",
    "as one of the alternatives it was proposed that a non - perturbative mass for the chiral tensor fields - the chirons - is generated .",
    "this can indeed stabilize the ground state such that a consistent quantum field theory is possible .",
    "an alternative for the non - perturbative ground state would be a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value for the chiral tensor fields .",
    "this would imply a spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry and rotation symmetry . while this second alternative may lead to a consistent quantum field theory with a stable ground state ,",
    "it is certainly not consistent with observations . in this case",
    "chiral tensors can not be used for a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .    in this paper",
    "we study the question of spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking via an expectation value of the chiral antisymmetric tensor fields @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in homogeneus @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetries of the model forbid terms quadratic in @xmath4 - this absence of a local mass term is a central ingredient for the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the effective potential @xmath5 for homogeneous @xmath4 therefore depends on invariants which involve at least four powers of @xmath4 . in a polynomial expansion the leading terms are quartic interactions @xmath6 .",
    "renormalizable couplings multiply these interactions . for suitable choices of the short - distance or `` classical '' couplings",
    "the quartic `` classical potential '' is positive semidefinite .",
    "however , the couplings are scale dependent and it may turn out that an instability of the origin @xmath7 occurs at lower scales , indicating a nonzero expectation value of @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the running of the quartic couplings in one loop order .",
    "we will concentrate on one particular coupling which has the property that a negative value would necessarily lead to instability in the limit of a quartic potential . in one - loop order",
    "we find that this coupling indeed flows towards negative values as the renormalization scale is lowered .",
    "we discuss the implications for spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking in the conclusions .",
    "the principal idea of the model relies on the observation that chiral information can be carried by an antisymmetric tensor field @xmath8 . while the renormalizable interactions between the fermions @xmath9 and the gauge bosons preserve a large global flavor symmetry , the observed fermion masses imply that this flavor symmetry must be broken .",
    "this explicit breaking must be mediated by couplings connecting the left- and right - handed fermions @xmath10 and @xmath11 which belong to the representations @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "bilinears involving @xmath10 and @xmath14 transform as @xmath15 and similar for @xmath16 .",
    "the violation of the flavor symmetry may therefore either involve the higgs scalar @xmath17 or the antisymmetric tensor @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , the six independent components of @xmath3 can be decomposed into two inequivalent three dimensional irreducible representations of the lorentz group @xmath19 with @xmath20 the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that the representations @xmath22 and @xmath23 are complex conjugate to each other .    the complex fields @xmath24 should belong to doublets of weak isospin and carry hypercharge @xmath25 .",
    "the explicit breaking of the flavor symmetry can then be encoded in the `` chiral couplings '' @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 with @xmath28(1\\pm\\gamma^5 ) .\\ ] ] details of our notation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the form of the interaction is dictated by @xmath29 gauge symmetry and lorentz symmetry .    beyond conserved baryon number and lepton number the lagrangian ( [ 2 ] )",
    "is further invariant with respect to a discrete @xmath30-symmetry that we denote by @xmath31 .",
    "it acts @xmath32 while all other fields are invariant .",
    "we will require that our model preserves the @xmath31-symmetry .",
    "the @xmath31-symmetry has an important consequence : no local mass term is allowed for the fields @xmath33 !",
    "indeed , a lorentz singlet is contained in @xmath34 or @xmath35 , the first being forbidden by hypercharge and the second by @xmath31-symmetry .",
    "the absence of an allowed mass term is in sharp contrast to the higgs mechanism and constitutes a crucial part of the solution to the hierarchy problem . on the other hand ,",
    "there exist kinetic terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the most general one allowed by all symmetries reads ( after a suitable rescaling and for vanishing gauge fields ) @xmath38 in terms of the unconstrained three - component fields @xmath39 @xmath40 the kinetic term reads in momentum space ( @xmath41 : four - volume ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 the inverse propagator @xmath44 obeys the relation @xmath45 ) @xmath46 and is invertible for @xmath47 . the only poles of the propagator occur for @xmath48 , indicating massless excitations .",
