    "the polarization properties of pulsar radio emission are highly diverse .",
    "nearly all possible polarization states have been detected , from pulsar to pulsar , from frequency to frequency , from pulse to pulse and even within one pulse profile .",
    "nevertheless , some general statements can be made from an observational point - of - view , which must be explained by any plausible theoretical model :    * pulsar radio emission is usually highly linearly polarized at low frequencies ( in the following `` low frequencies '' defines frequencies up to about one ghz , `` high frequencies '' corresponds to everything well above one ghz ) . towards higher frequencies the radiation tends to depolarize ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . *",
    "the observed polarization position angle ( hereafter ppa ) is a very stable feature which usually does not depend strongly on frequency .",
    "apart from the occurrence of sudden @xmath2 jumps , the so - called orthogonal polarization modes ( hereafter opm ) , the ppa usually follows a characteristic s - shaped curve .",
    "this curve can well be modelled by the rotating vector model ( hereafter rvm ) as proposed by radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) .",
    "it is therefore thought to reflect the geometry of the radiating field lines . *",
    "the sum of many ( typically at least a few hundred ) single pulses usually converges towards a characteristic average profile .",
    "in contrast , the individual pulses show a high variability .",
    "one well known single pulse feature is the _ quasi - periodic microsecond - structure _ ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) observed over a broad frequency interval with no obvious frequency dependence of the quasi - periodicity .",
    "it is usually highly linearly and circularly polarized with a roughly constant ppa and often opms at the edges .",
    "this suggests that , during one micro - pulse , only one of the orthogonal polarization modes is observed .",
    "another feature are the _ subpulses _ , sometimes drifting in pulse phase from one pulse to the next one .",
    "the ppa usually shows a swing during one subpulse , with the swing being stable relative to the subpulse .",
    "so when the subpulse drifts , the swing drifts as well , causing a depolarization in the integrated profile ( e.g. @xcite ) . * in average profiles and in individual pulses opms can be observed ( e.g. stinebring et al .",
    "1984 , gangadhara 1997 ) .",
    "the magnitude of these jumps is usually @xmath3 but can also be less sometimes .",
    "sudden orthogonal jumps in the ppa can be found in nearly all pulse phases and even at the same pulse phase in successive single pulses .",
    "the opms often coincide with changes in the handedness of the circular polarization .",
    "their existence therefore suggests that the radiation preferentially takes two orthogonal elliptical states . *",
    "some pulsars show a high degree of circular polarization , preferentially near the centroid of the profile .",
    "sometimes it also sometimes shows a sense reversal near the centroid ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations show that a few pulsars have a strong increase in their degree of circular polarization towards high frequencies together with a decrease in linear polarization , thus suggesting that a process might be active which transforms linear into circular polarization ( @xcite ) .",
    "* at low frequencies there seems to be no significant relation between the average degree of polarization and any other pulsar parameter . at higher frequencies , however",
    ", correlations have been found between the degree of polarization and the spin down luminosity @xmath1 respectively the surface acceleration potential ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "pulsars with a high @xmath1 ( respectively a short period and a large period derivative ) show a higher average polarization at high frequencies than those with a lower @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that for these pulsars a possible depolarization process becomes important at higher frequencies than for the other pulsars .",
    "closely connected to this is an anti - correlation between the degree of polarization at high frequencies and the period .",
    "only rapidly rotating pulsars seem to have highly polarized radio emission ( @xcite ) . *",
    "several authors estimated the emission altitudes where the observed radiation is produced and studied if there is a frequency dependence of this altitude ( cordes 1978 , rankin 1990 , thorsett 1991 , blaskiewicz et al .",
    "1991 , gil 1991 , phillips 1992 , gil & kijak 1997 , von hoensbroech & xilouris 1997 , kramer et al .",
    "various independent methods were used and all authors came to the conclusion that the radio emission originates from a region close to the pulsar surface at a few percent of the light cylinder radius ( at least for `` normal ''  non millisecond  pulsars ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of the emission height is thought to be small , if it exists at all .",
    "all these observational facts have to be explained within a general model for the polarization of pulsar radio emission . basically , there are two aspects which must be considered .",
    "one is the polarization characteristic of the emission process itself , and the other one is the influence of the magnetosphere on the propagating radiation . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the possible role of propagation for the polarization because this can be considered independently of the possible radiation mechanisms .",
    "the magnetosphere of a pulsar is filled with a plasma which is streaming relativistically outwards along the open field lines .",
    "a number of articles has already been published on propagational effects in this plasma .",
    "cocke & pacholczyk ( 1976 ) considered the effect of faraday pulsation for quasi - transverse propagation .",
    "faraday pulsation is the general case of faraday rotation .",
    "it occurs when a polarized beam decays into two elliptical orthogonal modes which propagate with different phase velocities .",
    "the ppa of the resulting beam gets rotated and the polarization changes between linear and circular .    in a series of papers melrose & stoneham ( 1977 ) , melrose ( 1979 ) and allen & melrose ( 1982 ) derived an approximation for the dispersion tensor and calculated the properties of the natural wave modes in the plasma ( see also lyutikov 1998 ) .",
    "they assumed that the polarization of the propagating electromagnetic wave follows the shape of the natural wave modes up to a certain radius of limiting polarization ( hereafter @xmath4 ) .",
    "the radiation then escapes with the polarization properties of the natural wave modes at @xmath4 . barnard ( 1986 )",
    "places @xmath4 at the place of cyclotron resonance . for normal pulsars",
    "this resonance occurs at a few 10% of the light cylinder radius , but for short period pulsars ( @xmath5 ) this resonance is outside @xmath6 .",
    "cheng & ruderman ( 1979 ) considered adiabatic walking to be responsible for the variable polarization in subpulses .",
    "the polarization properties were derived for different emission mechanisms and plasma compositions .",
    "harding & tademaru ( 1979 , 1980 , 1981 ) presented numerical calculations on the propagation of linearly polarized pulses through a shearing plasma .",
    "they show that this can account for micro - structure , circular polarization and rotation of the ppa .",
    "barnard & arons ( 1986 ) and arons & barnard ( 1986 ) have calculated the dispersion relations for the x- and the o - mode in an ultra - relativistic , one - dimensional plasma for distribution functions in @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the o - mode has its electric field vector in the plane of curvature of the magnetic field , the x - mode perpendicular to it ) . the x - mode is purely linearly polarized and propagates easily through the magnetosphere whereas the o - mode can have some circular contributions and follows the bending of the field lines .",
    "this causes a separation of the opms ( @xcite ) .",
    "calculations concerning the propagation characteristics of the various natural modes have also been presented by beskin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . using the limit of infinite magnetic field strength",
    "they conclude that only the electromagnetic x - mode can propagate freely through the magnetosphere .",
    "the angular dependence of the properties of the modes and the influence of the cyclotron resonance are derived .",
    "this resonance becomes only significant , if the secondary particle production rate is high ( @xmath9 per primary particle ) thus leading to a much higher plasma density .",
    "the different mode properties also account for the circular polarization often observed in core components .    in this paper",
    "we extended the ideas proposed by melrose & stoneham(1977 ) , melrose ( 1979 ) and allen & melrose ( 1982 ) .",
    "we derive the properties of the natural wave modes throughout the magnetosphere with special respect to the angle between the propagating wave and the magnetic field .",
    "we make predictions for the qualitative dependence of the polarimetric properties with frequency and various pulsar parameters .",
    "these predictions are then compared with the observations .",
    "for our calculations we use the following global picture for the pulsar radio emission ( e.g. manchester & taylor 1977 ) : the neutron star ( hereafter ns ) has a strong dipolar magnetic field which produces a corotating magnetosphere filled with charged particles which are drawn from the ns surface .",
    "it is convenient to define the light cylinder radius @xmath6 of the magnetosphere at which the corotation velocity is equal to the speed of light @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the speed of light and @xmath12 is the rotation period of the ns .",
    "those field lines which do not close within @xmath6 define the polar cap .",
    "the angular size of the polar cap is therefore given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the neutron star radius ( @xmath15 , lof stands for * l*ast * o*pen * f*ield line ) .",
    "the particles get accelerated above the polar cap and flow relativistically outwards along the open field lines .",
    "the motion is one dimensional ( all particles are in their lowest landau - levels ) .",
    "only one type of particles is considered ( here electrons ) .",
    "some pair producing processes might be active , thus adding another type of particles but we assume that there will always be one type dominating .",
    "the problems of strong pair production follows from considerations by kunzl et al . which will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    according to the model of goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) we use the following density :",
    "@xmath16 with @xmath17 being the elementary charge and @xmath18 the electric field constant .",
    "the surface magnetic field is defined as @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the moment of inertia of the ns and @xmath21 is the angle between the axis of rotation and the magnetic field axis .",
    "@xmath22 is the temporal derivative of the period , @xmath23 the magnetic field constant . as the field is dipolar , the magnetic field strength and the local plasma density decrease with the cube of the distance from the ns .    at a few percent of @xmath6",
    "the plasma produces radio emission .",
    "since we want to make our calculations independent of the actual emission mechanism , we only assume that the particles initially have a certain lorentz factor @xmath24 , just before they radiate .",
    "the angle of emission is approximately @xmath25 with respect to the field line along which they stream .",
    "after having radiated the particles flow further outwards and form the _ background _ plasma ( bg ) through which the radio waves have to propagate .",
    "naturally the background plasma has a lower lorentz factor than the radiating beam , i.e. @xmath26 . since the radio emission mechanism must be coherent and therefore very efficient , we assume that the energy spread of the background plasma is negligible above the emission region , thus the plasma is cold . in this case",
    "the cold plasma approximation applies and the energy distribution function is @xmath27    further , we assume that we observe only one natural wave mode at a time .",
    "the polarization properties of the wave correspond to the local form of the natural wave modes up to @xmath4 . above this radius ,",
    "the interaction between the propagating wave and the plasma becomes so weak that the escaping wave preserves the state of polarization of that radius to infinity ( see e.g. melrose 1979 , barnard 1986 and beskin et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath4 is @xmath6 but for most pulsars @xmath4 is probably reached at a closer distance .",
    "the minimum value for @xmath4 is the emission height itself .",
    "the assumption that only one polarization mode is observed at a time might not always be true , but the existence of highly polarized opms indicates that this is at least sometimes true . if both modes are observed simultaneously the radiation gets depolarized .",
    "the results of the following discussion can therefore be regarded as upper limits for the observed degrees of polarization .",
    "it is very important to analyze carefully the angle of the propagating wave relative to the magnetic field .",
    "this can be understood by an inspection of the extreme cases for parallel and transverse propagation . for an electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to a magnetic field ,",
    "the natural wave modes are circular ( r- and l - mode ) , whereas for transverse propagation they are linear ( x- and o - mode ) ( see e.g. @xcite or any standard plasma physics book ) . for oblique propagation intermediate states appear ( see fig . [ trans ] ) .",
    "it is our aim to calculate these states as a function of the various parameters involved .    to derive the angle between the propagating wave and the magnetic field lines the following contributions have to be considered : the angle which originates from the dipolar structure of the field , the angle associated with the _ aberration _ and the degree of _ magnetic sweep back_. aberration is the apparent forward bending of the field lines through the rotation of the pulsar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic sweep back is caused by the magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the magnetic field lines are bent in the direction opposite to the pulsar rotation by the electromagnetic torque of the neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "we do not consider the relativistic beaming angle ( @xmath28 ) outside the emitting region itself because this angle is symmetrical with respect to the direction of emission and will be averaged out statistically .      in a polar coordinate system ,",
    "the quotient @xmath29 is constant for a dipolar field line . having the ns in the centre , and defining each field line by its _ footpoint _",
    "( point of intersection ) at the ns - surface ( @xmath14,@xmath30 ) , a parametric equation describing the field line is given by : @xmath31 some straightforward calculations lead to an expression for the tangential angle @xmath32 of the @xmath30-field line : @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the radial angle of the @xmath30-field line at a distance @xmath36 ( see also lyne & graham - smith 1990 ) . the geometry is displayed in fig .",
    "[ dipol1 ] . this can be used to calculate the polar angle @xmath37 for a given distance @xmath36 at which a ray propagates , that was emitted tangentially from the @xmath30-field line at the emission height @xmath38 : @xmath39{0pt}{.65 cm } \\right]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this point ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) , the footpoint - angle @xmath40 of the corresponding field line can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ pardp ] ) .    the intersecting angle between a ray emitted tangentially from the @xmath30 field line in the emission height @xmath38 with the field line at the distance @xmath36 can then be found as the difference of the tangential angles @xmath41 as is shown in fig .",
    "[ dipol2 ] .",
    "the rotation of the magnetosphere causes additional effects which have to be considered for the intersecting angle .",
    "the radiation is bent forward into the direction of rotation by _",
    "aberration_. following phillips ( 1992 ) , the magnitude of this effect is @xmath42    at larger distances from the ns , corotation of the plasma can not be maintained , and _",
    "magnetic sweep - back _ becomes important .",
    "the calculation of this effect is rather complex , but an approximation was given by shitov ( 1983 ) : @xmath43 the direction of this effect is backwards relative to the rotation . to calculate the net - effect of these two contributions",
    ", one has to take their difference at the distance @xmath36 and subtract their value at the emission height @xmath38 .",
    "it is therefore given by @xmath44 angular contributions by effects of general relativity are negligible at distances larger than a few km from the ns surface ( e.g. gonthier & harding 1994 ) . since the contribution will always be much smaller than the accuracy of our calculations , which is restricted to the beaming angle of @xmath25 .",
    "for the resultant intersection angle ( see fig .",
    "[ dipol3 ] ) , the curvature direction of the emitting field line has to be taken into account .",
    "this can be defined as the angle between the plane of curvature of the emitting field line and the field line in the middle of the profile @xmath45 .",

    "as the radiation is beamed into a forward - cone of @xmath25 , and the intersected field lines are all nearly parallel in the emission region , we use this beaming - angle @xmath49 for @xmath50 .    in fig .",

    "these parameters are @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the magnetic inclination",
    "we assume @xmath53 .",
    "the regarded field line is at @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the footpoint angle of the last open field line , see eq .",
    "[ lof ] ) .",
    "as a typical emission height we choose @xmath57 of @xmath6 , which corresponds to slightly more than 50 pulsar radii for the canonical pulsar .",
    "for the lorentz factor of the background plasma we use be @xmath58 , following kunzl ( 1997 ) . in those cases , where we derive properties at a given distance in the magnetosphere , we use a point at @xmath59 of the light cylinder radius for @xmath4 ( see also sect .",
    "[ qual ] ) . as a typical value for @xmath24",
    "we assume a value of 50 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as stated earlier , the value of @xmath24 is only important very close to the emission region itself .      in order to derive the properties of the natural wave modes",
    "it is necessary to get an approximate idea of the dielectric characteristics of the plasma .",
    "our approach follows the work of melrose ( 1979 ) , which is based on two assumptions :    * the plasma is in the _ low density limit _ , which is defined by the condition that the alfv@xmath60n velocity is much larger than the velocity of light ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "combining the alfv@xmath60n velocity @xmath62 with the relativistic mass density @xmath63 leads to the condition @xmath64 this condition is well fulfilled throughout the pulsar magnetosphere . for our calculations",
    "this implies that the dielectric tensor is close to unity .",
    "* the background - plasma is assumed to be cold .",
    "this follows from the consideration that the coherent radiation mechanism can only be effective for particle energies above a certain threshold ( see eq .",
    "[ cold ] ) .",
    "the final particle energies will therefore peak at this critical value . + thus the _ long wavelength approximation _ applies , which can be used when the wavelength of the propagating wave is much larger than the relevant lengths in the plasma .",
    "this approximation should be fulfilled throughout in the pulsar magnetosphere above the emitting region .    using the low density limit",
    "the dielectric tensor may be written as @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the dispersion equation is then found as @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 being functions of @xmath70 . in this approximation @xmath71",
    "does not depend on @xmath72 .",
    "hence two solutions can be given for @xmath73 ( @xcite ) : @xmath74 using the cold plasma approximation for electrons the dielectric tensor leads to @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "the electron plasma frequency @xmath77 and the electron gyro frequency @xmath78 are defined as : @xmath79 @xmath72 is the plasma density ( @xmath80 , see eq .",

    "@xmath83 is the magnetic field strength ( @xmath84 , see eq .",
    "[ b0 ] ) .    with these parameters ,",
    "the axial ratio of the polarization ellipses of the two natural wave modes can be calculated : @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 correspond to linear polarizations . for elliptical polarizations",
    "@xmath88 becomes finite .",
    "the rotating sense of a positive @xmath88 is right hand with respect to the direction of propagation and left hand for negative @xmath88 .",
    "the degree of circular polarization can then be calculated through @xmath89 as a natural wave mode is fully polarized per definition , the linear polarization can be calculated as the quadratic complement : @xmath90",
    "the polarization of the natural wave modes depends mainly on the angle between the propagating electromagnetic wave and the magnetic field .",
    "if the wave propagates purely parallel to the field ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 being the wave vector of the propagating beam ) , the modes obviously have to be circularly polarized since no linear direction perpendicular to @xmath92 is preferred .",
    "when @xmath92 is perpendicular to @xmath93 , a direction is preferred and the wave is fully linearly polarized . if the angle between @xmath92 and @xmath93 becomes larger than @xmath94 then the handedness of the circular polarization gets reversed for each mode due to the opposite direction of the particle gyration .    the transition ( for an example see fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) between these two states depends strongly on a number of parameters :    * the magnetic field strength . for a strong magnetic field",
    ", the transition from circular to linear polarization occurs for very small angles between @xmath92 and @xmath93 . * the frequency . for lower frequencies , a higher degree of linear polarization",
    "is reached at smaller angles than for higher frequencies . * the plasma @xmath95-factor . for a relativistic plasma ,",
    "the intersecting angle between the propagating beam and the magnetic field is lorentz - transformed , such that the angle increases . the transverse propagation ( @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) is reached at a smaller angle .",
    "we apply these calculations to the propagation of an electromagnetic wave through the pulsar magnetosphere using canonical pulsar parameters ( sect .",
    "[ canonical ] ) and taking into account all angular effects .",
    "figure [ lvsx ] illustrates the change of the natural wave mode polarization characteristics with distance from the pulsar for different frequencies .",
    "for clarity , we displayed only the linear polarization for one mode ( the + mode , see eq .",
    "[ brecheq ] ) . as the circular polarization is given by the quadratic complement",
    "[ qucompl ] ) , a decrease of the linear polarization leads to an increase of the circular contribution .",
    "the dominating parameter is the rapidly decreasing magnetic field .",
    "after the radiation , the kinetic energy of the plasma is relatively low .",
    "following kunzl ( 1997 ) , we use a background lorentz factor of @xmath58 .",
    "this value would result from a free electron maser emission mechanism through comparing bunching- and loss times .",
    "other radiation mechanisms lead to different values of @xmath97 but the qualitative manner does not change .",
    "the dependence on @xmath97 is discussed separately in sect .",
    "[ lorentz ] .    the following qualitative behaviour can be observed .",
    "close to the emitting region , the mode is fully linearly polarized for all frequencies due to the extremely high magnetic field in the emitting region ( @xmath98 t ) . as the wave propagates outwards , the intersecting angle increases and the magnetic field decreases .",
    "initially this just causes the linear polarization of the high frequency waves to decrease , while the lower frequency waves maintain a high degree of linear polarization up to a large distance from the ns .",
    "thus , if only one mode is observed at a time , for a given distance we expect a _ decrease _ of linear polarization with frequency and an _ increase _ of circular polarization .",
    "as stated earlier , it remains unclear up to which distance from the ns the polarization of the propagating radiation is influenced by the changes of the natural wave modes ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this remains to be a problem to be solved by mode coupling theory but appears to be rather complicated as the plasma is most likely highly inhomogeneous in space and time .",
    "therefore for the present discussion we choose an arbitrary distance for @xmath4 and derive the qualitative behaviour without loss of generality .",
    "figure [ freq1 ] shows the frequency development of one natural wave mode at an arbitrary distance of 20% of @xmath6 for a typical pulsar .",
    "the degree of linear polarization should decrease and the degree of circular should increase above about one ghz .",
    "we now want to investigate , how the change of polarization characteristics with frequency depends on the variation of other pulsar parameters .      as stated in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , a correlation between the degree of polarization and the spin - down luminosity @xmath1 has been observed at high frequencies .",
    "@xmath99 @xmath100 is the moment of inertia . in order to perform our calculations for different values of @xmath1 , we keep all parameters fixed and change only the time derivative of the period @xmath22 . as before ,",
    "the period was set to 0.6 s and for @xmath22 we used the values @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath1 values of @xmath104 w , @xmath105 w and @xmath106 w respectively    figure [ edot ] shows that for high @xmath1 pulsars the degree of linear polarization decreases at a higher frequency than for low @xmath1 pulsars .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations , especially if one follows the argument of sect .",
    "[ assumptions ] and takes the degree of polarization as an upper limit . at low frequencies , all pulsars have a high degree of linear polarization as an upper limit .",
    "therefore no correlation with @xmath1 is expected . at higher frequencies  in contrary  the upper limit for low@xmath1 pulsars is low , whereas high@xmath1 pulsars can still exhibit highly linearly polarized radio emission .",
    "a correlation is therefore expected at those frequencies .",
    "the next parameter we vary is the period . in the list of observational constraints in sect .",
    "[ intro ] it was stated that only for short - period pulsars highly linearly polarized high frequency radio emission has been observed .",
    "we therefore keep all parameters fixed and vary only the period .",
    "the emission height was set to 2 % of the light cylinder radius ( and therefore changes in absolute numbers as the light cylinder radius varies with the period ) .",
    "figure [ period ] shows that short - period pulsars can maintain a higher degree of linear polarization up to a higher frequency than long - period pulsars .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the observations . at low frequencies",
    "the linear polarization can be high for all periods , we therefore would not expect an observable correlation . at high frequencies in contrast",
    "we therefore _ do _ expect an inverse correlation .",
    "the lorentz - factor of the background plasma is important because the intersecting angle gets lorentz transformed .",
    "if one increases the lorentz factor at a given point , the lorentz - transformed intersection angle first increases up to @xmath94 in the plasma frame , resulting in fully linearly polarized modes of transverse propagation ( see fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) . a further increase of @xmath97 leads to angles @xmath107 .",
    "the degree of linear polarization then decreases again and the circular contribution changes its handedness .",
    "this behaviour can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .",
    "one consequence is that if the lorentz transformed intersecting angle between the propagating wave and the magnetic field is close to perpendicular , small , local variations in the conditions can result into changes in the handedness of the circular polarization .",
    "as we have to assume that the plasma conditions are highly inhomogeneous in space and time , this effect could well account for sudden changes in handedness observed in low degree circular polarizations .",
    "an inference which can be made is that the background lorentz factor can not be very large , e.g. larger than a few hundred .",
    "so far we only regarded the polarimetric properties of _ one _ natural wave mode .",
    "but , as mentioned in sect . [ intro ] , observations suggest that both modes are present in the pulsar radio emission as the familiar opms . they can be observed both separated ( leading to highly polarized parts in the pulse profile with a smooth variation of the ppa ) and superposed ( leading to weakly polarized parts of the profile with often erratic variations in the ppa ) .",
    "a spatial separation of polarized modes in a medium is caused by birefringence , where both modes propagate independently with different indices of refraction ( a familiar example for such a medium is the calcite crystal ) .",
    "different indices of refraction lead to an angular separation which may result into an independent observation of the two modes .",
    "the magnitude of this angular separation is given by @xmath108 ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly the separation depends on the difference between the two indices of refraction .",
    "the larger the difference is , the better is the chance , that we observe the two modes separately .",
    "if the difference is small , we expect increasing superposition of the two modes , thus leading to a depolarization .",
    "figure [ brech ] shows the frequency dependence of the refractive indices of the two natural wave modes .",
    "the deviations of the indices from unity are displayed : @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "[ brecheq ] ) .",
    "the @xmath110mode corresponds to the x - mode ( the polarization vector lies in the plane spanned by @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , the @xmath111mode to the o - mode ( polarization vector perpendicular to @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn from the diagram : * 1 . * the refractive index of the o ",
    "mode is much stronger influenced by propagation effects than the one of the x - mode .",
    "this corresponds to the result of barnard & arons ( 1986 ) , that the x  mode can propagate through the magnetosphere nearly undisturbed , whereas the o ",
    "mode is tight to the bending of the field lines .",
    "the difference between the two refractive indices decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "this may lead to increasing superposition of the two natural wave modes ( either intrinsically or through the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the observation ) .",
    "if the phases of the modes are uncorrelated , this will cause a depolarization of the observed polarization .    if this conclusion is correct ",
    "depolarization at higher frequencies through superposition of opms  an additional depolarization envelope is superposed on our previous discussion .",
    "this depolarization could be responsible for the low number of pulsars which show the increasing degree of circular polarization towards high frequencies .",
    "the difference between the two indices depends on other pulsar parameters as well .",
    "figure [ dbrech ] displays the frequency dependence of this difference for various values for @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath112 is larger for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to a depolarization at higher frequencies compared to pulsars with a low @xmath1 .",
    "the peak in the curve for @xmath113 w is caused by a resonance when the wave reaches the doppler shifted gyro frequency .",
    "it is questionable whether the made approximation is valid at this particular point . following melrose ( 1979 ) and beskin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) we therefore neglect the resonance and join the asymptotic course on both sides of the peak .",
    "we have used the approximation of the dielectric tensor for the low frequency limit to derive the general properties of the natural wave modes in the radio pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the approximation of the dielectric tensor in the given limit implies that the plasma is sufficiently cold .",
    "following melrose ( 1979 ) this should be true for pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "electromagnetic waves , which propagate through a plasma at an oblique angle to the magnetic field , adopt two orthogonal natural wave modes with individual indices of refraction .",
    "we identify these modes with the familiar orthogonal polarization modes .",
    "it was our aim to derive the polarimetric properties of these modes and calculate their dependence on different parameters under special consideration of the various angles involved .",
    "we regard only one natural mode assuming that we see only one mode at a time .",
    "this assumption is of course not always true , but the existence of highly polarized emission in single pulses indicates that at least sometimes it is true . if both modes are recorded simultaneously , it will lead to a depolarization of the observed radiation .",
    "our results can therefore be regarded as upper limits for the observed degree of polarization . in the case of a highly linearly polarized natural mode",
    "we can not predict the degree of linear polarization one will observe .",
    "but if the mode has only a low level of linear polarization , a low level for the observed radiation is predicted .",
    "the main uncertainty of our calculations is the radius of limiting polarization ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , as we are mainly interested in the qualitative behaviour of the polarization , we have used a fixed value for @xmath4 without restriction of generality . for a different value of @xmath4",
    "the numbers may change but the general behaviour remains .",
    "this is even true if one moves @xmath4 to its possible extremes : the light cylinder radius and just above the emission region .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with the observations : * 1 . *",
    "the degree of linear polarization decreases towards high frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ freq1 ] ) .",
    "the decrease in linear polarization implies an increase in circular polarization ( within this concept ) .",
    "this is in agreement with recent observations which show the existence of some pulsars which have this peculiar polarimetric property ( @xcite ) .",
    "given a set of specific pulsar parameters , a variation of @xmath22 leads to a variation in the spin down luminosity @xmath114 .",
    "figure [ edot ] shows that the degree of linear polarization of pulsars with a high @xmath1 decreases at higher frequencies than for pulsars with a lower @xmath1 .",
    "thus a correlation between the polarization at high frequencies and @xmath1 should exist . such a correlation has been indeed observed .",
    "similar to the above point , we have varied the period , keeping all other pulsar parameters fixed ( fig .",
    "[ period ] ) .",
    "the degree of linear polarization for long period pulsars is expected to decrease at lower frequencies than for short periods pulsars .",
    "this should give an inverse correlation between the degree of linear polarization at high frequencies and the period .",
    "again , such an inverse correlation has been observed at a frequency of 5 ghz .",
    "no investigation could be made for the change of the polarimetric characteristics along the different field lines , which are observed during a pulse .",
    "the reason is that the qualitative change depends heavily on @xmath4 . for future work it therefore seems to be important to find an estimate for this distance .",
    "the difference between the refractive indices of the two modes decreases with frequency . as this implies a closer propagation of the modes , we expect an increasing superposition",
    "this would lead to a depolarization of the observed radiation at high frequencies .",
    "such a depolarization could account for low abundance of pulsars which show an increasing degree of circular polarization with frequencies .",
    "we note again that our calculations are based on the two assumptions that the background plasma is cold and is dominated by particles with one sign of charge .",
    "the obvious advantage of these assumptions  negligible spread of the energy distribution and no strong pair production  is their physical and mathematical simplicity . the more it is astounding that we can qualitatively reproduce the complex properties of pulsar radio polarization . in general both assumptions are not widely accepted .",
    "either the energy distribution of the plasma is usually taken to be extended ( arons & barnard 1986 ; lyutikov 1998 and references therein ) or the secondarily produced electron and positron pairs are expected to dominate the particle content of the pulsar magnetosphere ( e.g. sturrock 1971 , cheng & ruderman 1977 and daugherty & harding 1982 ) .",
    "however the expressiveness of our model deserves further considerations .",
