    "the theory of reionization has not yet advanced to the point of establishing unambiguously its timing and the relative contributions to it from galaxies of different masses . in a cold dark matter",
    "( `` cdm '' ) universe , these early galactic sources can be categorized by their host halo mass into minihalos ( `` mhs '' ) and `` atomic - cooling '' halos ( `` achs '' ) .",
    "mhs have masses @xmath6 @xmath7 and virial temperatures @xmath8 k , and thus molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) was necessary to cool the gas below this virial temperature to begin star formation .",
    "achs have @xmath9 @xmath7 and @xmath10 k , for which h - atom radiative line cooling alone was sufficient to support star formation",
    ". the achs can be split further into low - mass atomic - cooling halos ( `` lmachs '' ; @xmath11 @xmath7 ) , for which the gas pressure of the photoionization - heated intergalactic medium ( `` igm '' ) in an ionized patch prevented the halo from capturing the gas it needed to form stars , and high - mass atomic - cooling halos ( `` hmachs '' ; @xmath12 ) , for which gravity was strong enough to overcome this `` jeans - mass filter '' and form stars even in the ionized patches .",
    "once starlight escaped from galactic halos into the igm to reionize it , the ionized patches ( `` h ii regions '' ) of the igm became places in which star formation was suppressed in both mhs and lmachs . at the same time ,",
    "uv starlight at energies in the range 11.2  13.6 ev also escaped from the halos , capable of destroying the h@xmath1 molecules inside mhs through lyman - werner band ( `` lw '' ) dissociation , even in the neutral zones of the igm .",
    "this dissociation eventually prevented further star formation in some of the mhs where the background intensity was high enough .",
    "early estimates , in fact , suggested that this would have made the mh contribution to reionization small @xcite , and , until now , large - scale simulations of reionization have neglected them altogether .    in this letter",
    "we report the first radiative transfer ( rt ) simulations of reionization to include _ all three _ of the mass categories of reionization source halos , along with their radiative suppression , in a simulation volume large enough to capture both the global mean ionization history and the observable consequences of its evolving patchiness in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "we overcame the limitation of previous large - volume simulations by applying a newly developed sub - grid treatment to include mh sources ( section  [ sec : methods ] ) , and calculating the transfer of lw - band radiation self - consistently with the source population using the scheme of  @xcite .",
    "we performed a cosmological n - body simulation of structure formation with @xmath13 particles in a @xmath14 simulation box , using the wmap5 background cosmology @xcite . for this we used the code cubep@xmath15 m ( @xcite ; j. harnois - deraps et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , in which the gravity is computed by a p@xmath15 m ( particle - particle - particle - mesh ) scheme .",
    "the simulation was started at redshift @xmath16 and run to @xmath17 .",
    "n - body data were recorded at 86 equally - spaced times ( every @xmath18 ) from @xmath19 to @xmath17 .",
    "each data time - slice was then used to create matter density fields by smoothing the particle data adaptively onto a uniform mesh  or an `` rt grid ''  of @xmath20 cells .",
    "all cosmological halos with @xmath21 ( corresponding to 20 particles or more ) , and thus both lmachs and hmachs , were identified on - the - fly using a spherical overdensity halo finder with overdensity of @xmath22 with respect to the mean .    because mhs are too small to be resolved in our simulation box",
    ", our rt grid was populated with mhs through a newly - developed sub - grid model , as follows .",
    "we started with a separate , high - resolution n - body simulation of structure formation in a box with @xmath23 volume and @xmath24 particles , which resolved all mhs with @xmath25 with 20 particles or more .",
    "we then partitioned the box into a uniform grid of @xmath26 cells , such that each cell is the same size as one of the rt grid cells in our main , @xmath27  mpc simulation box , and calculated cell density and the total number of mhs per cell . a strong and tight correlation between the number of mhs located in a cell and its density",
    "is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - nmini ] ) .",
    "the best fit to this correlation at each redshift was then used as the total number of mhs in each grid cell of @xmath27  mpc box .",
    "based on these structure formation results for the igm density field and the source dark matter halos , we then calculated the radiative transfer of h - ionizing and @xmath28-dissociating photons ( see table  [ table : param ] for the rt simulation parameters ) .",
    "the stars inside achs are assumed to produce @xmath29 ionizing photons per baryon every 10 myrs , where @xmath30 , and where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath33 is the star formation efficiency , and @xmath34 is the number of ionizing photons per stellar baryon produced over the star s lifetime @xmath35  we use @xmath36 for both hmachs and lmachs , and @xmath37 for mhs .",
    "we assign one pop  iii star per mh , motivated by numerical simulations of first star formation inside mhs , which find that typically one pop iii star with a mass between 100 and @xmath38 forms per mh in the absence of strong soft uv radiative feedback @xcite . at each cell ,",
    "only those mhs which are _ newly _ collapsed every 1.92  myrs are assumed to host pop iii stars to roughly approximate the disruptive radiative and mechanical feedback by the first star and its by - products ( such as a supernova ) on the halo gas ( for this , we create `` morphed '' density fields every 1.92  myrs by linearly interpolating the n - body density fields in time which are separated by a time interval of 11.53  myrs , and finite - difference corresponding minihalo populations on each cell ) .",
    "star formation in mhs is further suppressed when the local lw background ",
    "calculated at each time step in 3d using the scheme by @xcite , but now considering both achs and mhs and also improved in speed using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) scheme  reaches a certain threshold @xmath39 . at present",
    "the precise value of this threshold is not well determined , but the typical values found by high - resolution simulations of mh star formation are @xmath40\\times 10^{-21}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm sr}^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "we adopted a constant value chosen from this range for each simulation . even though stars may still form by @xmath28 cooling , when @xmath41 , in mhs in mass range @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) , we neglect their contribution because they constitute only a small fraction of the whole mh population .    the simulations with achs only ( and without lw radiative transfer )",
    "are described in  @xcite .",
    "simulation parameters are given in table  [ table : param ] .",
    "we demonstrate the effects of the first stars by direct comparison of the results from two simulations , a fiducial case which includes all ionizing sources down to the first stars hosted by mhs ( case l2m1j1 ) and a corresponding reference case which includes the larger , atomically - cooling halos with exactly the same properties , but no mh sources ( case l2 , previously presented in  @xcite ) .",
    "our results show that the early reionization history is completely dominated by the first stars , while the late ( redshift @xmath46 ) history is driven by the stars inside hmachs ( figs  [ fig : globalx]a and  [ fig : globalx]b , top panel ) .",
    "the very first stars start to form inside mhs at redshift @xmath47 , and dominate the reionization process until @xmath48 but through self - regulation which slows their contribution to reionization around the plateau at @xmath49 observed in figs .  [",
    "fig : globalx]b and [ fig : models ] is a numerical artifact which occurs because lw suppression locks the mh star formation rate onto the level that keeps @xmath50 , and the simulation time step ( 1.92  myrs ) is comparable to the mh formation time scale . ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : globalx]b ) .",
    "although the abundance of achs rises exponentially , they remain relatively rare , and thus sub - dominant , until @xmath51 .",
    "after redshift @xmath52 , though , the two reionization histories become largely indistinguishable , because the same hmachs then dominate reionization and push @xmath53 _ above _ @xmath54 ( at @xmath55 ) halting mh star formation altogether , long before the mhs can complete reionization on their own .",
    "nonetheless , the mh sources ( the first stars ) can have quite a dramatic effect on the electron - scattering optical depth @xmath56 .",
    "while intergalactic h  ii regions fully overlap ( at redshift @xmath57 , here defined as when the mass - weighted mean ionized fraction in the igm , @xmath58 , first surpassed @xmath59 ) at almost identical redshifts @xmath60 with ( l2m1j1 ) or without ( l2 ) mhs , the early rise of @xmath58 with mh sources boosts the optical depth by as much as @xmath61 relative to that without mh sources : @xmath62 for l2m1j1 , while @xmath63 for l2 .",
    "this satisfies the current observational constraints on reionization : ( 1 ) reionization ended no earlier than redshift @xmath64  @xcite , and ( 2 ) @xmath65 at @xmath66 confidence level @xcite . predicted values of @xmath56 and @xmath67",
    "are model - dependent , and thus we tested the robustness of our conclusions by varying the physical parameters of mhs and achs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ) .    the first stars , born inside mhs , imprint a distinctive pattern on the global reionization history .",
    "for example , in case l2m1j1 , when the lw - plateau ended , reionization briefly stalled , since mhs no longer formed the stars which replenished the ionizing background and only ach sources remained , thereafter ; the ach contribution took a bit more time to climb enough to move reionization forward again .",
    "this explains the brief `` @xmath58-plateau '' from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalx]b for case l2m1j1 , while in case l2 , @xmath58 grows continuously without showing such a plateau ( fig .",
    "[ fig : globalx]b ) .",
    "this feature is generic ( see figs  [ fig : models ] and [ fig : ee]b for different sets of parameters we explored ) .",
    "reionization histories _ without _ mh sources , modelled either by large - scale rt simulations @xcite or semi - analytical calculations @xcite , are all similar in that respect .",
    "reionization histories _ with _",
    "mh sources calculated here , however , find an ionization plateau phase .",
    "previous studies that considered mh stars and their impact were not able to settle the issue of their global effect on reionization .",
    "this is either because they simulated volumes much too small to represent a fair portion of the universe @xcite , or else treated reionization by a semi - analytical , 1-zone , homogeneous approximation ( either _ with _ lw suppression included @xcite or _ without",
    "_ @xcite , which can not capture its innate spatially inhomogeneous nature , or made a semi - analytical approximation that accounted statistically for spatial inhomogeneity but without lw suppression @xcite .",
    "we find that the global reionization history at @xmath70 depends on @xmath54 more strongly than @xmath71 .",
    "this is due to the very nature of self - regulation of the first star formation .",
    "the larger the @xmath54 is , the weaker the suppression of star formation becomes , thereby temporarily hastening the progress of reionization .",
    "if @xmath71 is smaller @xcite than those simulated here , those stars produce less ionizing and lw radiation and the resulting suppression is weaker , which partly compensates for the lower emission per star .",
    "similar type of compensation would occur also when the number of mhs with a potential to form the first stars are smaller than our estimate , due to the relative offset of baryonic gas from some of the mhs @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the first stars hosted by mhs likely made an important contribution to reionization . but how can we probe them observationally ? while significant , the effects of the first stars are largely confined to the early stages of reionization , at redshifts @xmath72 , which puts them beyond the reach of most current instruments .",
    "recent observations by the south pole telescope ( spt ) have been used to place an upper limit on the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect from the epoch of reionization @xcite . while it has been suggested that this restricts the duration of reionization @xcite",
    ", we will show elsewhere ( h. park et al .",
    "2012 , in prep ) that the ksz signal from our fiducial case , l2m1j1 , is well below the observed upper bound .",
    "the combined effect of the first stars will be reflected in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization anisotropies at large scales .",
    "the current best constraints on @xmath56 by the _ wmap _",
    "satellite @xmath56 are still relatively weak , and thus models with low-@xmath56 values like l2 are still acceptable at the @xmath73 ( 95% ) confidence level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : globalx]b , middle panel ) . however , through the far more precise measurement of the cmb polarization by the _ planck _ mission we should be able to discern the influence of the first stars on reionization .    as we discussed above , current observational constraints suggest that reionization was not complete before @xmath74 . imposing this condition as a prior on the allowed reionization histories @xmath75 ,",
    "we predict that the _ planck _ mission will clearly detect the era of first stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ee ] we show a statistical measure of the _ planck _ sensitivity to detecting the signature of the first stars through the principal component analysis by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who modified cosmomc @xcite to allow generic reionization models ) , we created 7 sets of principal components based on @xmath76 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : xez_pc ] for the definition of @xmath77 ) , which make @xmath78 behave well around @xmath79 .",
    "we then use this late - reionization prior to reject any sample reionization history with @xmath80 when forming the monte - carlo markov - chain of varying reionization models .",
    "second , we improve the physicality condition , or @xmath81 at any z , which was somewhat poorly applied in @xcite . whenever a set of @xmath82 parameters ( eq .  [ eq : mmu ] ) are sampled , we calculate the corresponding @xmath78 , and when either @xmath83 or @xmath84 is violated , we reject that sample .",
    "this small , 4% non - physicality in @xmath85 is still necessary because of the oscillatory nature of @xmath78 caused by the limited number of principal components , but has only modest effects on the cmb e - mode polarization power spectrum @xmath86 . ] .",
    "reionization principal components @xmath87 are eigen - vectors of the relevant fisher matrix ( evaluated with an artibrarily chosen fiducial history @xmath77 ) , @xmath88 which can be used to describe any generic ionization history @xmath78 with just a small number of modes , such that @xmath89 the mode amplitude @xmath90 , for a given history @xmath78 , becomes @xmath91}{z_{\\rm max}-z_{\\rm min}}.   \\label{eq : mmu}\\ ] ] based on the _ planck _ data after its full 2 years of planned operation , the narrow posterior distribution of allowed @xmath56 values will allow us to distinguish reionization models like l2 and l2m1j1 _ unambiguously _ , and thereby strongly constrain the available reionization models .",
    "a high measured measured value of @xmath92 will be a clear ( if indirect ) signature of the first stars .",
    "finally , we note that the presence of mh sources introduces the @xmath58-plateau noted above , which in turn imprints characteristic features in @xmath86 .",
    "hence , _ planck _ might be able to distinguish ( albeit at lower statistical significance , of @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) reionization models with and without first stars _ even _ if they have very similar values of @xmath95 and @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ee]b ) .",
    "full reionization simulations like ours find it hard to satisfy both of these observational constraints without including a significant contribution from the first stars , but some semi - analytical models ( @xcite ; @xmath96 and @xmath97 in fig .  [ fig : ee]b which are of unnaturally large gaps in relative efficiencies of lmach and hmach ) do find such scenarios .",
    "however , all such models lack the plateau feature in @xmath75 , regardless of the details of the assumed physics , and reside in a narrow window of @xmath98-parameter space adjacent to that occupied by our no - mh cases , as demonstrated in fig .  [",

    "planck _ will either probe the signature of the first stars , or show that the first stars had a negligible impact on reionizaion .",
    "once these first results confirm the role of the first stars , simulations of the type presented here can be used to study other observable quantities and thus deepen our understanding of the early universe .",
