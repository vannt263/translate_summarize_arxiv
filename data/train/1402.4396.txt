    "a central topic of spintronics is the design and realization of spin injectors.@xcite these are contacts that allow one to induce a spin accumulation ( in general terms , an imbalance of the chemical potential for the two spin channels ) in a substrate . while spin injectors integrated within the technological si standard@xcite would be most desirable , their actual implementation is hindered by various factors .    indeed ,",
    "while the spin injection may in principle be accomplished using magnetic transition metals and their alloys , the preparation of an atomically well - defined interface between a transition metal and the si surface is very difficult due to the high tendency of exothermic silicide formation.@xcite as an alternative one could use a light @xmath7  metal such as al as a contact layer between si and the ferromagnet .",
    "ohmic contacts between si and al are well - studied and form a standard component in si device technology.@xcite more importantly , al displays a very large spin diffusion length,@xcite and hence al leads are suitable to conduct a spin - polarized current without substantial losses .",
    "the problem is then rendered into finding an appropriately matching ferromagnetic system acting as spin injector .",
    "for this task , the ferromagnetic heusler alloys have been recently investigated theoretically as promising candidates.@xcite in their ideal @xmath8 crystal structure these systems are ferromagnetic half - metals,@xcite which in principle allows a high degree of spin polarization of the injected current .",
    "moreover [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ figstrucs](a ) ] the @xmath8 structure can be matched by an @xmath9 structure rotated by @xmath10 about the @xmath11-axis .",
    "in particular , the co - based full heusler alloys co@xmath0tisi or co@xmath0tige recommend themselves for integrated spin injectors in combination with an al contact layer as the experimentally determined lattice mismatch is small ( less than @xmath12  % ) .    applying an external voltage to a heusler / al / si junction may not be , however , the best way to achieve a high value of spin accumulation . a considerable obstacle in the practical realization of a metal - semiconductor spin injector is the so - called conductivity mismatch@xcite between the different materials .",
    "this leads to a potential drop in locations where it is not useful for the device , while the spin accumulation in the semiconductor itself might remain small .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that this difficulty could be overcome by applying an external temperature gradient , rather than an external voltage , in order to induce the spin accumulation : exploiting the seebeck effect , a temperature gradient across the contact directly results in a difference in the chemical potentials in the two spin channels due to the spin - dependence of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "this difference is independent of an injected current and hence unaffected by a possible mismatch in conductivity .",
    "experimental studies@xcite on bulk samples have shown that the ti - based heusler alloys , such as co@xmath0tisi or co@xmath0tige , display large seebeck voltages ( tens of @xmath4v / k ) of negative sign under an applied temperature gradient .",
    "one would expect from these findings that these materials , in conjunction with their half - metallic electronic structure , might also show a large _ spin_-dependence of the seebeck coefficient , thus making them suitable candidates for spin injectors based on spincaloric effects .",
    "bulk al , on the other hand , is known to exhibit a rather small , negative seebeck coefficient : @xmath13  @xmath4v / k at room temperature , and somewhat increased at lower temperatures due to phonon drag.@xcite thus , using al as contact material will have little impact on the thermoelectric properties of the junction .",
    "it is the aim of our present investigations to assess the ability of al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al ( @xmath1 = si or ge ) trilayers to serve as thermally driven spin injectors .",
    "this has been accomplished by performing first - principles calculations of the electronic structure and of the thermoelectric transport properties . while ignoring the other side of the device , the spin injector - semiconductor contact , we focused on two specific problems for the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al systems : ( i ) the stability and the electronic structure of the al / heusler interface , and ( ii ) whether they open a promising path towards maximizing the thermally induced spin accumulation .",
    "we further provide a detailed insight in the electronic transport mechanisms in these junctions , accounting for a realistic morphology of the interface and focusing on the electronic structure contribution to the transmission and seebeck coefficient .",
    "our results show that the formation energy of the al / heusler interface is negative , which means that these interfaces are stable . while both heusler alloys can match the al substrate either with a ti-@xmath1 or a co - co atomic plane , the former needs non - equilibrium growth conditions to avoid the formation of competing ti@xmath1 compounds . in the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al",
    "trilayers both conventional and spin - dependent seebeck effects are found to be sensitive to the specific atomic structure of the al / heusler interface and the actual spacer material .",
    "we compare the results obtained for the heterostructures with those of the bulk heusler alloys in their cubic and tetragonally distorted structures .",
    "we find that a subtle interplay between biaxial strain and the transmission channel selectivity governs the transport properties of the investigated trilayer systems .",
    "in particular , for a thin co@xmath0tisi or co@xmath0tige layer terminated by a ti - si or ti - ge plane , the spin - dependent seebeck coefficient is positive and of the same order of magnitude as the conventional , spin - averaged seebeck coefficient . for a co - co - terminated al / co@xmath0tige / al trilayer",
    "both coefficients are negative .",
    "this suggests the possibility of achieving a large and stable spin accumulation by employing appropriate growth conditions during sample preparation .",
    "at the center of our investigations are the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al junctions in trilayer geometry , with @xmath2 si or ge . we give here the geometric arguments for the feasibility of such heterostructures and will show later by first - principles calculations that they are energetically stable .",
    "the co@xmath0ti@xmath1 compounds belong to the class of full heusler alloys@xcite of type @xmath14 which crystallize in the cubic @xmath8 structure .",
    "this crystal structure , depicted in fig .  [ figstrucs](a ) , has a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) primitive cell with four inequivalent atomic sites .",
    "it is usually described as four inter - penetrating fcc sublattices , respectively occupied by the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath1 atoms , shifted against each other by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the cubic lattice constant .",
    "alternatively , one can represent the @xmath8 structure by two inter - penetrating @xmath19 and @xmath20 zinc - blende structures , with the latter shifted by @xmath21 .",
    "aluminum , on the other hand , possesses the simple @xmath9 crystal structure , consisting of an fcc bravais lattice with one atom per unit cell . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figstrucs](a ) , the @xmath9 structure , rotated by @xmath10 about the @xmath11 axis , represents a natural continuation of the @xmath8 structure , enabling a perfect epitaxial match of the two systems if their lattice constants are in a ratio of @xmath22 .",
    "the two heusler alloys chosen for the present study deviate only slightly from this condition , namely by @xmath23  % for co@xmath0tisi / al and @xmath24  % for co@xmath0tige / al .",
    "bringing together the two structures , on the other hand , requires the use of a tetragonal unit cell of in - plane lattice constant @xmath25 , with unit vectors oriented along the @xmath8-@xmath26 and @xmath27 directions , and of varying length @xmath28 along the common @xmath29 direction .",
    "each plane of the tetragonal unit cell contains two inequivalent atomic sites .",
    "the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1 heterostructures were modeled with such supercells with @xmath30 fixed to the equilibrium lattice constant of al metal .",
    "we considered two terminations of the heusler materials at the interface to the al electrodes : a pure co - co layer and a mixed ti-@xmath1 layer , where @xmath2  si or ge , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figstrucs](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the supercells contain @xmath31 al planes and @xmath32 co ( ti-@xmath1 ) and ti-@xmath1 ( co ) heusler planes , leading to an appropriate , well - converged potential in the al electrodes .",
    "we constructed the supercells such that the heusler atoms simply continue the al fcc lattice by occupying the hollow sites next to the interface .",
    "all internal atomic positions have been accurately optimized using hellmann - feynman forces to reduce the force components below @xmath33  mry / bohr and the energy changes below @xmath34  mry .",
    "moreover , the length of the tetragonal al / heusler / al supercells has been optimized for each considered structure in order to determine the ideal , energy - minimizing al - heusler spacing .",
    "the electronic structure and transport calculations have been performed within the framework of spin - polarized density functional theory ( dft ) employing the plane - wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the quantum espresso code,@xcite with the pbe@xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) parametrization of the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "corrections to the interface energy as they arise , for instance , due to the phonon free energy at finite temperatures are neglected , since they will certainly be similar for the different structures . in writing down this expression ,",

    "these scattering mechanisms are expected to become more and more important at high temperatures .",
    "for example , including the electron scattering by spin fluctuations in various ferromagnetic metals and alloys had lead to a better agreement of the temperature dependent resistivity with experimental data.@xcite a recent study@xcite investigated the effect of spin disorder on the magneto - thermoelectric phenomena in nano - structured co systems . it could be demonstrated that , while the spin - dependent electron scattering does indeed influence the spin - caloric transport coefficients at high temperatures , this influence is strongly case dependent , such that , without an explicit calculation , no actual quantitative or qualitative predictions can be made . in the following ,",
    "we restrict our investigations to a temperature range below @xmath79  k and assume that the trends determined on the basis of the electronic contribution alone are relatively reliable .",
    "we also neglect the possible magnetic anisotropy of the seebeck coefficient@xcite which may be induced by the spin - orbit coupling , since the elemental constituents of the investigated systems are relatively light .",

    "both atomic and unit cell parameter relaxation is allowed to occur in order to minimize the total energy .",
    "in such a setup , no actual interaction with the substrate is accounted for , isolating this way the effect of the epitaxial biaxial strain on the electronic structure of the material under investigation .",

[ dosco2tiz ] , again in very good agreement with those obtained by other authors,@xcite further evidence that the @xmath39 states of ti ( red / light gray lines ) are almost completely empty and that the spin magnetic moment of @xmath89 found in these systems stems exclusively from the two co atoms ( dashed blue / dark gray lines ) .",

    "we note , however , that the measurements of barth _",

    "this provides the explanation for the drop in the total magnetization evidenced in fig .",
    "[ eandmepiheu ] : since with increasing height of the tetragonal cell the minority spin band gap gets narrower and it plunges below the fermi energy , the system becomes metallic .",
    "note that the tetragonal distortion of epitaxial co@xmath0tisi at equilibrium is less pronounced and , as a consequence , the minority spin band gap reduction is smaller in this case .",
    "we will investigate in the next section the al / heusler interface and will show that , within few monolayers away from it , the heusler alloys stabilize into a tetragonal structure of identical geometry as determined here for the free standing system .",
    "one can therefore regard the al / heusler / al trilayer systems as comprising a tetragonally distorted heusler alloy spacer .",
    "the band structure features discussed here have an important influence on the transport properties of the whole junction ; for example , the minority - spin band gap reduction is equivalent to a lowering of the potential barrier for spin - down electrons .",

    "we will show in this section by means of _ ab initio _ thermodynamics that the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1 ( @xmath2 si , ge ) interfaces , both with co - co and ti-@xmath1 terminations , have a negative formation energy and are thus stable against al and co@xmath0ti@xmath1 separation . the stabilization of ti-@xmath1-terminated interfaces , however , requires non - equilibrium growth conditions because of the competing formation of ti@xmath1 compounds .",
    "in addition , we find that within a short distance away from the interface the heusler systems take on the epitaxial geometry discussed in the preceding section , with a preserved half - metallicity reflected in the electronic structure .",
    "such a fast transition to the half - metallic state appears to be an ubiquitous characteristic of the heusler - based interfaces , whether they contain other heusler alloys@xcite , semiconductors like si,@xcite or insulators like mgo.@xcite      we describe the interfaces in our calculations using the tetragonal supercells depicted in fig .",

    "this means that , in principle , either of the two terminations can be stabilized against al and co@xmath0ti@xmath1 separation , depending on @xmath121 , and thus on the growth conditions .",

    "a similar correspondence can be seen for the co - co - terminated systems in the right column of fig .",
    "[ kaptransef](b ) . as anticipated from the @xmath193 transmission profiles in fig .",
    "[ alheutrans ] , the @xmath199 plots bear the typical characteristics of tunneling : very few transmission channels , mostly oriented along @xmath106 and @xmath107 and placed near the 2d - bz center ( close to normal incidence ) , do participate in the transmission . on the other hand , comparison of the frames corresponding to identical spacer ,",
    "e.g. , co@xmath0tige , but different terminations , shows clear qualitative differences in the transmission which are caused by the nature of the al / heusler contact .",
    "the majority spin channels , fig .",
    "[ kaptransef](a ) , for the two ti-@xmath1 terminations also display striking similarities : the different spacer materials change only the amplitude in transmission , but do not introduce or remove any individual transmission channels .",
    "this is directly reflected in the two transmission profiles @xmath184 ( fig .",
    "[ alheutrans ] ) and the seebeck coefficients calculated for the ti-@xmath1 terminations ( fig .  [ alheusebsigma ] ) that were found to share the same qualitative energy and temperature dependence .    on the contrary ,",
    "dissimilar transmission patterns are observed for the co - co - terminated al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al trilayers in the majority spin channel , fig .",
    "[ kaptransef](a ) , right column .",
    "while the transmission at @xmath111 for the co@xmath0tige spacer shows large contributions near @xmath200 ( corresponding to normal incidence ) , these channels are almost blocked for co@xmath0tisi ( the dark blue area around @xmath201 ) . in turn",
    ", co@xmath0tisi favors transmission channels far from @xmath201 , located along the diagonals of the 2d - bz which appear very weak in co@xmath0tige .",
    "here we recall that the al / co@xmath0tige / al ( co - co ) system has been found to be the only trilayer structure for which @xmath184 passes @xmath111 with a positive slope .",
    "the redistribution of weights among the various transmission channels in the 2d - bz could explain the peculiar interface sensitivity of @xmath184 and thus of @xmath169 , @xmath202 , and @xmath167 evidenced above .",
    "the final evidence must come from the _ energy dependence _ of the various transmission channels . to make this point",
    ", we show in figure  [ kaptransevar ] contour plots tracking the evolution of @xmath203 for several energy arguments , @xmath204  mev , @xmath111 , and @xmath205  mev .",
    "the layout of this figure is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ kaptransef ] ( ti-@xmath1-terminated systems on the left and co - co - terminated on the right ) , but we have added the transmission maps of bulk al leads .",
    "they represent the incoming / receiving available transmission channels and correspond to hypothetical transmission maps unaffected by the electronic structure of the heusler spacers and the al / heusler interfaces .",
    "the map for @xmath197 is equivalent to the projected fermi surface of al .        by showing the comparison to the transmission function of",
    "the al leads , we demonstrate that the absence of transmission near @xmath201 for the al / co@xmath0tisi / al ( co - co ) trilayer is _ not _ induced by the leads , but rather an intrinsic materials property of this heusler alloy .",
    "moreover , taking just al bulk , one would expect the intensity and width of the transmission around the zone center to increase . as can be seen",
    ", the al / co@xmath0tisi / al trilayer with co - co termination lacks such transmission channels for _ all _ energy arguments . in turn",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath203 for the transmission channels along the 2d - bz diagonals is almost independent of energy .",
    "this implies that @xmath184 exhibits only a weak energy dependence and thus @xmath206 is very small .",
    "this behavior is in contrast to the al / co@xmath0tige / al system with co - co termination : apart from the presence of the additional transmission channel at @xmath201 , the contributions from transmission channels along the 2d - bz diagonals tend to increase with energy .",
    "thus , these channels contribute with negative sign to @xmath206 . the ti-@xmath1 terminated systems , on the other hand , share qualitatively similar features , with small quantitative differences , over a wide energy range .",
    "we have investigated the structural stability and the potential applicability as thermally driven spin injectors of heterojunctions consisting of al(001 ) and thin films of the closely lattice - matched heusler alloys co@xmath0tisi and co@xmath0tige .",
    "our most important findings can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the al structure can be continued by heusler alloys terminated either by co - co or ti-@xmath1 ( @xmath2 si or ge ) planes ; _ ab initio _ thermodynamic calculations predict that both terminations are stable against al and co@xmath0ti@xmath1 separation .",
    "formation of ti-@xmath1-terminated interfaces requires , however , non - equilibrium growth conditions .",
    "\\(ii ) as a consequence of a smaller equilibrium co - al bond length than ti - al or si(ge)-al , the structural relaxation occurring at the interface leads to a smaller separation between al and the heusler alloy spacer in the case of a co - co - terminated interface .",
    "this configuration appears to favor the co - al hybridization across the interface .",
    "\\(iii ) the small lattice mismatch between the two components ( al and heusler alloy ) results in a sharp localization of the interface specific distortions , both morphologic and in the electronic structure . within @xmath155",
    "mls away from the interface the heusler alloys accommodate an epitaxial , tetragonally distorted structure with a preserved half - metallicity .",
    "the systems can be still regarded as metal / half - metal heterojunctions , but the effective thickness of the half - metallic spacer is smaller than the geometric thickness of the heusler film .",
    "\\(iv ) for the position of the fermi level found in undoped samples , the effective and spin - dependent seebeck coefficients are dominated by the majority spin carriers and significantly depend on the particular spacer / termination combination . combined with the growth conditions dependence of the formation of a specific stable interface , this establishes a direct connection between growth and spin - caloric properties control in these samples .",
    "\\(v ) the ti-@xmath1-terminated heusler spacer layers exhibit qualitative similar features with slight quantitative differences caused by varying the group iv element @xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "the spin - dependent seebeck coefficient is predicted to be large , actually of the same size as the effective seebeck coefficient .",
    "this practically means that nearly the entire voltage generated under a temperature gradient is converted into spin accumulation !",
    "\\(vi ) for the co - co termination , the transport properties of the two heusler materials studied by us were quantitatively _ and _ qualitatively different . in particular , we could show that the co - co - terminated al / co@xmath0tisi / al heterojunction exhibits a much weaker energy dependence of transmission and thus a very small ( both effective and spin - dependent ) seebeck coefficient .",
    "for the co - co - terminated al / co@xmath0tige / al heterojunction , the obtainable spin - dependent seebeck coefficient is limited by the partial cancellation of contributions from spin - up and spin - down electrons .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the al / co@xmath0ti@xmath1/al trilayers with ti-@xmath1 termination appear to be most suitable for achieving thermally driven spin injection of majority spin carriers .",
    "the actual growth of such systems has been shown to be attainable under out of equilibrium conditions . in order to exploit the semiconductor - like electronic structure of the heusler alloys for minority spin injection , an additional fine - tuning of the fermi level position in these materials would be required .",
    "if the fermi energy could be brought close to the minority spin conduction band edge , e.g. , by some way of doping , it may be possible to obtain a material that displays large @xmath165 due to the enhanced contribution of the minority spin electrons .",
    "regardless of the type of carriers chosen , our calculations show that a rather significant spin - dependent potential can be generated in the al / heusler / al junctions under a thermal gradient provided that the neglected scattering processes ( electron - magnon and electron - phonon ) have a reduced deleterious character .",
    "the remaining issue , not treated here , is the actual spin injection into a semiconductor , such as si , brought in contact with the trilayer .",
    "the resulting heterostructure , al / heusler / al / si , would certainly require a careful choice of the thickness of the second al layer , which acts as buffer between the heusler alloy and the semiconductor .",
    "for a thin al layer , the situation corresponds to a ballistic spin injection similar to that investigated theoretically by mavropoulos for the fe / si system,@xcite and could be treated by a similar method as employed here .",
    "alternatively , the thickness of the al can be even larger , though not exceeding the spin relaxation length . in this case ,",
    "explicit calculations can be carried out separately for the al / heusler / al and al / si systems and their results combined within the spin - charge coupling model developed by scharf _",
    "et al._@xcite we certainly hope that such theoretical investigations will trigger corresponding experimental efforts .",
