    "from a conceptual point of view , there are two distinct approaches to describe a quantum system : with discrete or continuous variables .",
    "the conspicuous differences between them stem from the effect quantization has in these two cases . for the remarkable example of light , which will serve as our thread here",
    ", field quantization does not change the mode pattern , but rather the excitation per mode . therefore ,",
    "if we look at the energy , we find a discrete spectrum , but if we focus on field variables , such as quadratures , their spectra are continuous and quantization manifests itself as unavoidable quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "any state of the electromagnetic field can be expressed in the photon - number basis , but it is always possible to convert this description to the continuous - variable language and vice versa .",
    "the choice of a suitable picture ultimately depends on the experiment under consideration .",
    "if we use photon - number resolving detectors , the fock basis is a natural choice . for homodyne detection",
    "though , the continuous - variable approach is a more convenient alternative .    in the discrete - variable",
    "setting , the dimensionality of a quantum system can be regarded as a resource .",
    "thus , testing the hilbert space dimension is important for quantifying the power of quantum correlations  @xcite , a central issue in quantum information .    in the continuous - variable world , information is encoded in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "while this is entirely satisfactory from a theoretical perspective , in realistic implementations one is physically restricted to a truncated hilbert space .",
    "this is particularly evident in quantum tomography : any reconstructed density operator is always represented by a finite - dimensional positive matrix  @xcite .",
    "this brings up at once the problem of finding the appropriate subspace containing the unknown state , which will be dubbed as the physical sector .",
    "a common strategy is to make an educated guess about the state ( such as gaussianity  @xcite or rank deficiency  @xcite ) , which defines a reconstruction subspace .",
    "yet , when the guess is inaccurate this introduces systematic errors , which is a serious drawback .",
    "algorithms for statistical model selection , such as akaike  @xcite or schwarz criteria  @xcite or the `` likelihood sieve ''  @xcite , have already been used in attempts to locate the signal .",
    "unfortunately , their application to the quantum world is not straightforward due to the positivity constraint on density operators  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we identify the physical sector using a fast filtration method , without carrying out a full state estimation .",
    "this entails efficiently solving linear systems of equations and its feasibility is supported by a direct experimental confirmation . in this way",
    ", the state - space sectors are efficiently and systematically analyzed solely from the measured data , and the corresponding physical sector is filtered out without assuming any _ a priori _ knowledge about the unknown state .",
    "the quantum state is represented by a density matrix @xmath0 , which belongs to the algebra @xmath1 of all hilbert  schmidt operators acting on a separable hilbert space @xmath2 ( whose dimension is otherwise arbitrary , finite or not ) .    in general ,",
    "measurements performed on the system are described by positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) , which are a set of nonnegative hermitian operators @xmath3 that resolve the identity : @xmath4 . each povm outcome represents a single output channel of the measurement apparatus  @xcite ; the probability of detecting the @xmath5th output is given by born s rule @xmath6 .",
    "the _ physical sector _ of the quantum state @xmath0 is the _ smallest _",
    "subspace @xmath7 that encompasses all the significant physical content of @xmath0 ( with high statistical confidence ) .",
    "this subspace @xmath8 , of dimension @xmath9 , is spanned by a trace - orthonormal hermitian basis @xmath10 . when restricted to this sector ,",
    "the signal state and the povm outcomes read @xmath11 where the measurement matrix @xmath12 , of elements @xmath13 , is real .",
    "since @xmath14 , if the state is to be unambiguously assigned to the probabilities @xmath15 , the matrix @xmath12 must have at least @xmath16 linearly independent rows , so @xmath17 , which can be verified from the singular value decomposition of @xmath12 .",
    "our purpose is to set forth a proficient method for the precise identification of the effective physical sector out of the infinite - dimensional @xmath18 .",
    "the scheme requires no _",
    "ad  hoc _ assumptions or prior information whatsoever about the state @xmath0 : only the measured data are necessary to determine @xmath8 .",
    "it relies on two fundamental aspects :    \\1 .",
    "_ subspace filtration .",
    "_ by construction , it is possible to design _ filter random variables _  ( rvs ) to systematically _ learn _ the physical subspace of any unknown quantum state . for a given set of relative - frequency data @xmath19 and a particular operator subspace @xmath20 ,",
    "these filter rvs are defined by @xmath21 with @xmath22 obeying the linear system : @xmath23 where and @xmath24 is the complement of @xmath20 and @xmath25 is just an arbitrary value that may be set to a constant different from 0 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath26 is an extremely small value when @xmath20 is sufficiently large so that @xmath0 is effectively contained . starting with @xmath27 ,",
    "the scheme inspects @xmath26 while systematically increasing @xmath28 , and terminates when @xmath26 is sufficiently small , so that enlarging @xmath20 further no longer includes any significant physical content of @xmath0 .",
    "_ statistical reliability_. the statistical quantity @xmath26 is associated to the significance error @xmath29 \\ , , \\ ] ] which determines how statistically significant it is to conclude that @xmath30 for a certain error margin @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is less than some prechosen @xmath33 , we say that the physical sector is identified up to @xmath33 significance .",
    "the filtration identifies a physical subspace that fully contains @xmath0 . to improve the resolution of this subspace and",
    "ultimately obtain the correct @xmath8 , we note that , in the computational basis , there is an obvious link between @xmath8 and the photon - number distribution .",
    "since @xmath34 , @xmath8 corresponds to the sector of nonzero diagonal entries @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 can be subsequently filtered after acquiring a rough estimate of the photon number distribution using linear inversion for sufficiently accurate @xmath19 . put differently , there is a one - to - one mapping of @xmath8 to a @xmath35-dimensional fock subspace .",
    "because of this connection , only measurements that are mixtures of fock states are necessary for physical - sector filtration .",
    "the filtration procedure can be concisely formulated as a protocol as follows :    step 1 .",
    ": :    assign the largest possible value @xmath36 for    subspaces @xmath20 which you deem larger than    @xmath8 .",
    "this value only defines    the largest dimension of all numerical matrices manipulated on the    computer . in no way",
    "is this integer number involved directly in the    physical - sector filtration .",
    "[ step : dmax ] step 2 .",
    ": :    calculate the @xmath37 measurement matrix    @xmath38    ( @xmath39 ) for _ all _ the    @xmath40 measured diagonal povm outcomes .",
    "multiply its pseudoinverse @xmath41    to the @xmath42 column of measured data    @xmath43 to get    @xmath44 .",
    "then    @xmath45 is an estimate of the photon - number    distribution .",
    ": :    sort the fock numbers @xmath46 in descending order and start    the filtration in this reordered ascending integer sequence    \\{@xmath47}. step 4 .",
    ": :    set @xmath48 .",
    ": :    set    @xmath49.[step : h ] step 6 .",
    ": :    compute @xmath50 and    @xmath51 from eq .  .",
    "[ step : compute_all ] step 7 .",
    ": :    increase @xmath52 by one and repeat step 5 and step 6 until    @xmath51 is smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "this concludes the filtration .",
    ": :    translate @xmath53 back to @xmath46 and read    off the physical sector from the list @xmath54 .     on simulated data for @xmath55 detection events for the mixed state @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is fixed at 40 and 2000 different subsets of @xmath57 random diagonal povm outcomes of ( renormalized ) standard gaussian - distributed entries were used to calculate the average @xmath58 and the corresponding @xmath59 ( blue histogram ) . the physical sector @xmath8 ( yellow region ) is revealed after filtration with respect to a 5% significance level ( @xmath60 ) ( red solid line ) . ]",
    "the value of @xmath36 in step 1 can be adjusted by minimizing the smallest @xmath61 so that the maximal subspace truly contains the physical sector of @xmath0 .",
    "the filtration always converges to the physical sector by construction , since @xmath61 ultimately drops to zero for sufficiently large @xmath53 .",
    "if the smallest @xmath61 is still relatively large , this is a clear indication that the physical sector is still not fully identified , and a larger @xmath36 is subsequently chosen . for a more detailed analysis ,",
    "the reader is invited to consult the appendix .",
    "to illustrate the strategy , we consider the signal state @xmath62 .",
    "monte carlo data are generated with a random povm consisting of diagonal matrices .",
    "the filtered @xmath8 after reordering is shown in fig .",
    "since the photon - number distribution ultimately decays to zero for sufficiently large @xmath46 , the decision that the physical content is insignificant has to be made with greater statistical finesse , such that the required value of @xmath63 is typically larger near the higher - end tail of the distribution . for small @xmath63",
    ", this information is muddled by statistical fluctuations and results in a smaller @xmath8 owing to the imprecise discerning of the drop in physical content .",
    "random errors may be minimized by filtering with different subsets of @xmath36 povm outcomes and calculating an average @xmath64 for every @xmath65 out of these subsets .",
    "moreover , one can detect additional systematic errors that are not attributed to truncation artifacts by inspecting in the corresponding histograms whether these errors are larger than the statistical fluctuation .",
    "notably , our method can certainly be applied to discrete - variable measurements . to confirm this",
    ", we consider the arrangement in ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses single photons to encode the information in horizontal ( @xmath66 ) and vertical ( @xmath67 ) polarizations , and in two spatial modes ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) .",
    "we define four basis states : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . on passing through three suitably oriented half - wave plates at angles @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , the state of the emitted photon can be converted to the pure state @xmath77 , defined by @xmath78 thus , by adjusting the orientation angles @xmath79 , one could produce qubits , qutrits or ququarts . here",
    ", we show that our method can rapidly identify the physical - sector of this black box by inspecting only the data measured from a set of compatible quantum measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the graphs for a qubit , qutrit and ququart system characterized by the different ( @xmath80 ) configurations .",
    "it is clear that the operational physical - sector filtration procedure outlined before is more than just supplying a dimension witness .",
    "it allows us to probe the quantum details of the black box using only the data at hand .",
    "notice that the relevant basis states , labeled by @xmath46 , form a basis for the commuting measurement on the black box . as such",
    ", this procedure is not a bootstrapping instruction .",
    "rather , it systematically identifies the correct physical sector without any other _ ad hoc _ assertions about the black box . in this way",
    ", it simultaneously serves also as an efficient _ deterministic _ dimension tester with complexity @xmath81 .         detection events .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is set at 60 and 5000 different subsets of @xmath82 outcomes were used to calculate the average @xmath58 and the corresponding @xmath59 for each @xmath46 .",
    "figure specifications follow those of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]",
    "we have experimentally validated our approach by measuring photon - click events of a time - multiplexed detector ( tmd ) .",
    "we use a fiber integrated setup to generate and measure a mixture of coherent states , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "coherent states are produced by a pulsed diode laser with 35  ps pulses at 200  khz and a wavelength of 1550  nm .",
    "these pulses are then modulated with a telecom mach - zehnder amplitude modulator , driven with a square - wave signal at 230  khz .",
    "this produces pseudorandom pulse patterns with two fixed amplitudes . after passing through fiber - attenuators ,",
    "the state is measured with an eight - bin tmd  @xcite with a bin separation of 125  ns and two superconducting nanowire detectors .",
    "we record statistics of all possible @xmath83 bin configurations , which corresponds to a total of 256 povm outcomes .    to obtain the povm of the tmd , we perform standard detector tomography , using well calibrated coherent probe states  @xcite .",
    "the setup is very similar to the previous one , but we replace the modulator by a controllable variable attenuator .",
    "we calibrate the attenuation with respect to a power meter at the laser output .",
    "this allows us to produce a set of 150 probe states with a power separation of 0.2  db .",
    "tmd data of a statistical mixture of two coherent states are collected and physical - sector filtration is subsequently performed on these data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . unlike the statistical mixture of fock states that is used for the simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this state does not have sharp borders for its physical sector because of its poissonian nature .",
    "nevertheless , this sector is efficiently and correctly filtered out .",
    "the accuracy of the filtration is ultimately sensitive to experimental imperfections . in this case , these imperfections are minimized owing to the state - of - the - art superconductor technology , the fruit of which is a histogram that is as clean as it gets in an experimental setting .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] provides convincing evidence of the feasibility and practical performance of the technique , where real data statistical fluctuation is present .",
    "this physical sector may subsequently be taken as the objective starting point for a more refined investigation of the quantum signal with tools for tomography and diagnostics .",
    "we have demonstrated a suitable procedure to systematically identify the physical sector of an unknown quantum state ( pure or mixed ) by solely inspecting the data obtained from simple photon statistics .",
    "this can be done without the need for ideal photon - number - resolving detectors or other sophisticated measurements .",
    "the fruit of this procedure is a tool that efficiently identifies the support of any unknown quantum state without any _ a priori _ assumptions about the source whatsoever , which can later be used for an objective state reconstruction .",
    "this implies that the usual belief that a source is prepared in a certain specified subspace ( say a pure state in some one - dimensional support ) is absolutely unnecessary .",
    "although the availability of this knowledge may _ optionally _ be used to improve the speed , the entire numerical procedure involves no more than data inspection .",
    "our method is inspired by concepts of pattern filtration in neural networks and is extremely robust , for it works for all types of signal sources and requires neither state estimation nor any other assumptions about the source .",
    "this affords an optimal solution to the problem of assigning a reconstruction subspace for a quantum state of light in continuous - variable tomography that is operational in nature and efficient in practice : @xmath84 for a single run of filtration and subsequent reconstruction as opposed to a sum of @xmath85 with @xmath86 for repeated state estimation .",
    "finally , we have proven its practicality by performing physical - sector filtration on both simulated and experimental data , and simultaneously identifying this procedure as a fast deterministic quantum - dimension testing protocol .",

    "to confirm the extent to which a signal state @xmath0 is contained in an arbitrary subspace @xmath87 , we introduce the filter operator @xmath88 where @xmath22 is some real parameter related to the @xmath5th povm outcome and will be specified shortly .",

    "we request that in the limit of large number of measurement copies @xmath63 , the mean @xmath92 of this rv approaches zero for arbitrary @xmath93 .",
    "such a filter rv always exists : if we restrict the filtration to a dimension @xmath94 , the coefficients @xmath95 can be calculated by solving the set of linear equations @xmath96 where @xmath25 are real nonzero constants and @xmath24 is the complement of @xmath20 . in other words , the operator defined in eq .",

    "in this way , the filter rvs give a clear indication when the entire physical sector is fully identified .",
    "to analyze the filter rv for a finite number of measurement copies @xmath63 , we make use of some statistical tools . when @xmath63 is large enough for the frequencies @xmath97 to be asymptotically independent , the probability that the absolute difference between @xmath98 and its mean is greater than some @xmath99 is constrained by the hoeffding concentration inequality  @xcite : @xmath100 this illustrates the interplay between the @xmath95 and @xmath63 . if the system   is ill - conditioned , such that the coefficients @xmath95 are large , a large @xmath63 is needed to assess the statistical and truncation errors .",
    "filtration proceeds by performing a measurement with @xmath63 copies of the unknown signal state with a specified povm [ the appropriate @xmath63 is established from eq .",
    "] , then constructing filter rvs for different subspaces @xmath20 and inspecting them to check whether they contain the signal state sufficiently .",
    "the smallest of those subspaces @xmath20 is precisely the physical sector @xmath8 .",
    "conventionally , this last step is done by testing the hypothesis that @xmath104 . if the components of @xmath98 are themselves statistically independent rvs , by the central limit theorem , the rv @xmath98 is also gaussian distributed and one may employ either one of the popular @xmath105- or @xmath106-tests .",
    "we posit here a simpler and more robust method by means of another concentration inequality that can be obtained from the variance @xmath107 of the filter rv  @xcite .",
    "if one stipulates that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , one has @xmath110 the above inequality hints at a simple way to diagnose the different reconstruction subspaces . for @xmath111 , the variance @xmath107 scales as @xmath112 . hence , in this regime , a comparison between @xmath113 and @xmath114 can serve as an indication of the truncation errors . the extent to which truncation artifacts are ruled out with this comparison",
    "is dictated by the value of @xmath63 such that the condition @xmath115 holds .",
    "as @xmath63 increases , the filtered subspace uniquely converges to the true physical sector @xmath8 .",
    "more generally , these quantities reveal the influence of both statistical and systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "this also indicates that the splitting @xmath116 of the filter rv @xmath98 is aptly surveyed by the lower bound in eq .  .",
    "evidently , if the signal lives in a finite - dimensional subspace ; that is , if @xmath117 for the basis operators @xmath118 spanning the complement @xmath24 , then for sufficiently large @xmath63 a clear transition in @xmath98 is detected across the subspace boundaries .    in view of these arguments ,",
