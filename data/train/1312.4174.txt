    "quantum systems can be driven far from equilibrium either by time - dependent perturbation or by coupling to reservoirs at different chemical potentials or temperatures . in the latter case ,",
    "the system is said to be open because it can exchange particles and/or energy with the reservoirs , hence particle and/or energy currents flow throughout the system .",
    "such processes take place in different contexts , ranging from nanoscale thermo - electric conductors to bio - chemical reactions .",
    "the recent developments in modern techniques of microscopic manipulation and nanotechnologies enable us to build functional nanoscale systems , for example , electronic nanodevices or molecular motors .",
    "transport properties and fluctuations in such systems can nowadays be experimentally resolved @xcite .    at equilibrium ,",
    "small fluctuations in a system satisfy a universal relation known as the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem @xcite .",
    "the fd relation connects spontaneous fluctuations to the linear response of the system and holds for both the classical and quantum cases .    the search for similar relations for systems driven far from equilibrium has been an active area of research for many decades .",
    "a major breakthrough had taken place with the discovery of exact fluctuation relations , which hold for classical systems at non - equilibrium ( ne ) @xcite .",
    "the derivation of fluctuation theorems for quantum systems has also been considered in refs .  [ ] , either in the context of quantum heat conduction or electron full counting statistics @xcite in open quantum systems .",
    "another route to study ne fd relations is to find effective local thermodynamical variables ( temperature , chemical potential ) dependent on the ne conditions , but entering the conventional equilibrium fd relations @xcite .    on one hand ,",
    "we know that , at equilibrium , the universal expression of the fd theorem involves the thermodynamical variables of the system , i.e. the temperature and the chemical potential . on the other hand ,",
    "we know that the steady state regime can be seen as an effective equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "it is therefore mostly interesting to know if there exist extensions of the fd theorem to the ne steady state of an open quantum system connected to reservoirs at their own ( but different ) equilibrium .",
    "for instance , we can ask ourselves if there is a unique functional form of the fd theorem which depends only on the different thermodynamical variables of the reservoirs , i.e. their different temperatures and chemical potentials ?    motivated by understanding such ne properties at the nanoscale and their potential use in practical nanodevices , we study , in this paper , generalisations of fd relations to ne conditions in the presence of both charge and heat transport in the steady state regime .",
    "we consider a two - terminal nanodevice where the central region consists of a single electron level in the presence ( or absence ) of interaction .    for this model ,",
    "we show that there is no unique universal expression for the fd relations in a ne steady state .",
    "the fd relations depend on the thermodynamical properties of the reservoirs and on the corresponding forces ( gradients ) that drive the open quantum system out of equilibrium , and on the interaction present in that system .    in particular , we focus on the ne fd relationships for one - particle correlation functions , i.e. the electron green s functions ( gfs ) , and for two - particle correlation functions , i.e. the current - current ( jj ) and charge - charge ( cc ) correlation and response functions .",
    "we extend the concept of the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) and fd relations to the ne steady state regime .",
    "the expressions for the kms and fd relations for our model open quantum system connected to two reservoirs ( in the presence of a finite applied bias and a temperature gradient ) are explicitly derived .",
    "furthermore we also consider the many - body ( mb ) effects on such relations by using a model of an interacting electron - phonon system .",
    "we show that the fd relation for the one - particle correlation functions is strongly dependent on both the ne conditions and the interaction between particles . while the fd relations for the two - particle correlation functions are much less dependent on the interaction .",

    "in this paper , we consider the fd relations of one- and two - particle correlation functions in the context of non - equilibrium steady state quantum transport .",

    "in such cases , the validity of the lowest order expansion for the interaction self - energies becomes questionable ( see refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "the dependence of fdr[cc ] on the interaction is more important than for fdr[jj ] .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that , in our model , the electron - phonon interaction is mediated via the charge density ( the local operators @xmath208 ) in the central region .",
    "hence the dependence on the interaction is stronger in the cc correlations than in the jj correlations , since the current is a non - local operator , not directly related to the charge density in the central region .    ) .",

    "the system is always electron - hole symmetric .",
    "once again , one can see the dependence of the fdr[gf ] and of the fdr[cc ] on the ne and mb effects .",
    "the effects of the interaction are still less pronounced in the fdr of the current - current correlation functions .",
    "note that , in opposition to the off - resonant regime , the inverse fdr of the cc correlations and the fdr of the gf are qualitatively similar : they both present a oscillations with the energy argument .                                                                                                    in the d.c .",
    "limit ( @xmath160 ) , we obtain the usual expression for the nyquist - johnson noise @xmath293 , with the linear conductance expressed as @xmath294 , see for example refs .
