    "[ fig : realcwpulsed](c)/(g ) .",
    "first of all , the main conclusion is that both in experiment and theory the creation of excitons by the _ probe _ laser leads to a blue - shift of the polariton dispersion , which moves it into resonance with the _ pump _ laser .",
    "the density of the _ pump _ state becomes then sufficient to start opo scattering into the _ signal _ and _ idler _ states .",
    "because of the hysteresis of the polariton system in the bistable regime , the _ pump _ density remains high even when the probe excitons have decayed through relaxation and emission from strongly photonic states .",
    "the opo regime persists for more than 1 nanosecond , much longer than the characteristic decay times in the system .",
    "the presence of the confinement potential of the pillar prevents the escape of the _ signal _ polaritons under the influence of the potential of the _ pump _ , contributing to the persistence of the opo .",
    "the decay of the opo is due to the overall imbalance between pumping and losses .",
    "the small difference between pumping and losses becomes more and more important because the decrease of the total polariton density leads to a redshift of the pumped mode , bringing it out of opo resonance , decreasing the efficiency of pumping even further .",
    "this is evidenced in the experiments by the fact that the time evolution of the intensity becomes a concave function of time ( the effective lifetime becomes progressively shorter at longer times ) . in the simulations , increasing the pumping allows to overcome this decay and to maintain a permanently stable opo regime .",
    "however , one should note that in the bistable configurations , the presence of noise ( spontaneous scattering ) leads to spontaneous transitions between the two stable solutions at long time scales .",
    "this noise also contributes to drive the system towards the low - intensity state and to switch - off the opo .",
    "more conclusions can be drawn from the spatial shape of the signal at different moments of time , which results from the interplay of several effects . at initial moments of time ,",
    "the density becomes sufficient to surpass the opo threshold everywhere in the pillar , with a large spreading in the reciprocal space caused by different phase matching conditions ( different signal wave vectors and energies ) in different points because of the non - homogeneous pump profile .",
    "however , the _ signal _ exhibits a homogeneous emission over the whole surface of the pillar , the rapid spreading of polaritons being caused by the strong interactions between all particles : those created by the _ pump _ ( once the bistability is passed ) and those injected with the _ probe_. this is well reproduced by the theoretical simulations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : theory](a ) ] . at later times",
    "[ fig : theory](b ) ] , as the total density drops down and the spatial redistribution stabilizes , the signal concentrates around opposite sides of the pillar along the x axis .",
    "this is due to the spatial shape of the _ pump _ laser , which creates the conditions favorable for the opo only in these points , located at the minima between the _ pump _ spot and the pillar boundary : the _ pump _ density at the center of the pillar is too high to maintain resonant opo , because the signal polaritons are pushed away from the center and there their density becomes insufficient to maintain stable opo .",
    "the overall good agreement between theory and experiment supports our interpretation of the experimental observations .",
    "we have presented new experimental conditions to obtain a long - lived polariton condensate in a pillar mc .",
    "it involves two excitation beams impinging at the center of the pillar with the same wavevector : a _ cw _ _ pump _ , slightly blue - detuned from the inflection point of the lpb , and a pulsed _ probe _ , resonantly creating excitons .",
    "the polariton population created with the arrival of the _ probe _ induces a blue - shift of the lpb , which enters into resonance with the _ pump _ beam , triggering the opo - process .",
    "_ pump _ keeps on feeding the opo after the pulsed _ probe _ has disappeared , because of the hysteresis of the polariton bistability . as a result of the combined effect of both beams , the opo signal emission lasts for more than 1 ns , much longer than any of the characteristic times of the mc .",
    "the polariton condensate dynamics observed when using just the _ probe _ beam is remarkably similar , but much shorter lived , to that obtained for the two beam excitation . the exciton population created by the _ probe _",
    "beam efficiently relaxes to the lpb and from there follows the opo dynamics .",
    "the characteristic decay time is one order of magnitude shorter than that obtained under the two beam excitation conditions .",
