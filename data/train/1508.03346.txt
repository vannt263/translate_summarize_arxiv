    "the probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution is @xmath136 for the 2  mpc scale .",
    "thus for the smaller smoothing length the null hypothesis is rejected at a @xmath137 significance level .",
    "the probability is lower for 3  mpc scale : @xmath138 gives a marginal @xmath139 rejection .",

    "the number of quiescent and compact quiescent galaxies in the majority of the histogram bins in figure  [ f7 ] exceeds @xmath140 .",

    "the resulting contrast between the gsmd distributions for the compact and for the parent quiescent samples is thus not affected by small - number statistics .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ f8 ] show maps of the gsmd field , constructed using a smoothing scale of 2  mpc , in three redshift slices ( of similar volumes ) between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we derive these density maps based on the spatial distribution of quiescent galaxies ( blue circles in the bottom panels of figure  [ f8 ] ) .",
    "to construct gsmd maps we use a linear radial basis function to interpolate between the positions where we evaluate the gsmd .",
    "we avoid the edges of the survey ( areas outside dashed - line squares in figure  [ f8 ] ) because the gsmd is underestimated in regions where our sample is not complete . in each redshift slice ,",
    "massive compact galaxies ( gray circles in the top panels and red circles in the bottom panels of figure  [ f8 ] ) favor denser regions ( see also figure  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "we also examine the gsmd distribution for massive compact quiescent galaxy samples selected based on more conservative compactness thresholds .",
    "all compact samples exhibit the same preference for denser regions .",
    "however , a smaller number of systems in the samples with more extreme properties decreases the significance of the two - sample a - d test results . for the compact sample of 50 quiescent galaxies with @xmath143 ( eq .  [ eq : def ] ) , the null hypothesis that the gsmd distributions for the compact and for the parent quiescent sample originate from the same underlying distribution is rejected at a marginal @xmath144 significance level ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the sample of massive quiescent compact systems with @xmath146 contains only 10 objects ; obviously inadequate for statistical analysis .",
    "a study of the environments of intermediate - redshift galaxy samples covering a broad range of compactness levels requires a survey covering a field larger than the cosmos field .",

    "we explore the impact of the massive nature of compact galaxies .",
    "we use magnitude - limited samples of non - compact quiescent galaxies and compact quiescent galaxies with the same stellar mass distribution to test whether the distribution of the gsmd around compact and non - compact objects differ .    at @xmath147 massive ( @xmath148 ) red galaxies , regardless of compactness , reside preferentially in high - density regions ( e.g. , @xcite ( cosmos ) , @xcite ( candels - uds and goods - s ) ) .",
    "thus the difference in the stellar mass distribution of our parent quiescent sample and the compact subsample may account for the observed difference in environments ( figure  [ f6 ] ) .",
    "massive compact galaxies populate the higher - mass end of the distribution for the underlying quiescent population ( figure  [ f9 ] ) .",
    "the parent quiescent galaxy sample spans the galaxy stellar mass range from @xmath149 to @xmath88 , with a median value of @xmath150 .",
    "the minimum stellar mass for the compact subsample is @xmath151 , and the median mass is @xmath152 .",
    "the two stellar mass distributions differ : a @xmath122 value of @xmath153 corresponds to a @xmath154 rejection of the hypothesis that the two stellar mass distribution originate from the same parent sample ( central panel of figure  [ f9 ] ) .",
    "to further investigate the relationship between the high stellar mass of compact galaxies and their surrounding gsmd , we use the compact stellar mass probability distribution ( red hatched area in the top panel of figure  [ f9 ] ) to select a sample of non - compact ( @xmath155 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : def ] ) quiescent objects with the same stellar mass distribution as the compact sample .",
    "we then evaluate the gsmd field around the most massive non - compact quiescent systems using the smoothing kernel density estimation technique described in section  [ method ] .    in figure  [ f10 ]",
    "we compare the gsmd distribution around massive compact ( red histogram ) and non - compact objects ( green histogram ) for the 2  mpc smoothing length ( see section  [ densityfield ] ) .",
    "the distributions for the two types of objects are indistinguishable ( @xmath156 , central panel of figure  [ f10 ] ) .",
    "this comparison suggests that the observed tendency of massive compact galaxies at @xmath18 in the cosmos sample towards regions of greater surrounding gsmd is mainly driven by the greater stellar masses of compact systems .    if the environment were strongly related to compactness rather than or in addition to the mass , we might expect a residual difference between the distributions presented in three panels of figure  [ f10 ] .",

    "the central panel shows cumulative density distribution for the two subsamples .",
    "the gsmd distribution for the massive non - compact subsample is indistinguishable from the equivalent distribution for compact galaxies .",
    "several recent studies investigate the relationship between massive ( @xmath84 ) galaxy size and environment over cosmic time , with diverse results .",
    "some of the results at high redshift ( @xmath157 ) suggest that quiescent color - selected galaxies in clusters on average have larger sizes than their massive analogs in less dense regions @xcite .",
    "a similar difference apparently occurs between quiescent galaxy sizes in the highest and the lowest density regions @xcite .",
    "however , other high - redshift studies suggest the absence of any trend with environment @xcite .",
    "still others find that quiescent galaxies with early - type morphologies appear more compact in clusters than in lower density regions @xcite .",
    "depending on the sample selection and definition of the environment , previous analyses of intermediate - redshift quiescent galaxy samples paint an equally confusing picture . both galaxy counts in a fixed physical aperture and the distance to the nearest n - th neighbor",
    "suggest that at @xmath158 quiescent galaxies are larger in high local galaxy density environments .",
    "this positive trend in size with local galaxy density is less pronounced than at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "group galaxies in the cosmos field at @xmath159 selected either based on red rest - frame colors or on early - type morphology follow the same size - stellar mass relation as their counterparts in less dense regions @xcite .",

    "the results are also inconclusive .",
    "early - type galaxies appear to follow the same size - mass relation in all environments @xcite .",
    "however , cluster galaxies in the pm2gc and wings survey display a different trend : quiescent dense galaxies are proportionally more numerous in clusters than in other types of environments @xcite . a large @xmath162 dataset drawn from sdss",
    "dr7 shows that massive ( @xmath163 ) early - type galaxies are smaller in the over - dense than in under - dense regions @xcite , although the difference in size is not as pronounced as in pm2gc- and wings - based studies .    to understand the range of results it is important to distinguish the impact of size from the impact of mass . in order to make this distinction",
    ", samples must be selected with identical mass distributions ( section  [ mass ] ) . the well - known correlation between galaxy intrinsic luminosity and/or stellar mass and local density requires this approach @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether other studies take this known dependence into account .",
    "once the mass is taken into account , the variety of results may persist because of 1 ) the use of photometric redshifts , 2 ) small , incomplete galaxy samples ( especially at high redshift ) , 3 ) the range of environments probed , 4 ) and the techniques used for gsmd field estimation .",
    "thus a direct quantitative comparison among these studies is not possible .",
    "other observational results show a trend toward smaller sizes of @xmath162 massive early - type galaxies in overdense regions in sdss @xcite and in nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite indicate that their theoretical results are also consistent with @xcite .",
    "results presented here may be consistent with the observed trends in low - redshift clusters ( and thus in agreement with some theoretical predictions of * ? ? ? * ) , but our sample is not large enough to discriminate between the impact of mass and compactness .",
    "a concern in comparing the observations with theory is that the simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict a steep decline in the number density of massive compact quiescent systems with redshift , discrepant with the most recent observational evidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "resolution of these issues and a more extensive consideration of the relations among galaxy compactness , mass , and environment are an impetus for surveys covering larger volumes than offered by cosmos .",
