    "molecular motors @xcite are either proteins or macromolecular complexes that utilize some form of input energy ( often chemical energy ) to perform mechanical work . in many circumstances ,",
    "molecular motors move collectively on a single track in a manner that has strong resemblance with vehicular traffic @xcite . in recent years",
    "some minimal models of molecular motor traffic have been developed to study their generic features @xcite .",
    "more detailed models for specific motor traffic systems have also been proposed by capturing the stochastic mechano - chemistry of individual motors as well as their steric interactions within the same model to investigate the interplay of individual and collective dynamics of the motors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we develop such a model for a specific class of motors for which no attempt has been made in the past to capture their steric interactions during traffic - like collective movements on a single track .    according to the central dogma of molecular biology ,",
    "the genetic message stored in the dna is first _",
    "transcribed _ into messenger rna ( mrna ) from which it is then _ translated _ into proteins .",
    "polymerization of a mrna from the corresponding single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) template is carried out by a motor called rna polymerase ( rnap ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , synthesis of a protein from the corresponding mrna template is mediated by another motor , called ribosome , which translocates along the mrna strand .",
    "the steric interactions between the neighbouring ribosomes , which simultaneously translocate along the same mrna , were taken into account in most of the theoretical models of translation developed since the late sixties @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of the close similarities between the template - dictated and motor - driven polymerization of macromolecules in transcription and translation , no attempt has been made in the past to incorporate interactions of rnaps in the theoretical description of transcription .",
    "instead , to our knowledge , all the models of transcription reported so far @xcite capture only the stochatic mechano - chemistry of the individual rnap motors .",
    "cooperation and collisions between rnap motors is known to have non - trivial effects on the rate of transcription @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the possibility of the formation of queues in rnap traffic has also been explored @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the gene is relatively short , a sufficiently long queue of rnaps on the ssdna template can reduce the accessibility of the promoter sequence thereby lowering the rate of further initiation of transcription .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to develop a model of rnap traffic that incorporates steric interactions between rnap motors which move along the same dna track . in this model , we incorporate the most essential features of the multi - step mechano - chemical pathway of the individual rnap motors by a scheme which was used earlier in wang et al.s @xcite model for single rnap .",
    "the steric interaction between the rnaps is assumed to be hard - core repulsion .",
    "the effects of these interactions of rnaps is captured in our model of mrna synthesis in the same manner in which the steric interactions of ribosomes was captured in a recent model @xcite of protein synthesis .    in the spirit of traffic science @xcite , we define the _ flux _ to be the average number of motors crossing a site per unit time . thus , flux is expressed in the units `` number per second '' .",
    "we define the number density to be the average number of rnaps attached to unit length of the dna template . using the terminology of traffic science",
    ", we refer to the relation between the flux and the number density of the rnaps as the _",
    "fundamental diagram_. we calculate the flux and investigate its dependence on the number density of rnap on the dna template as well as on some other experimentally accessible parameters of the model .",
    "since average speed of a rnap is also a measure of the average rate of mrna elongation and the flux gives the total rate of mrna synthesis from a dna template , our calculations predict the effects of rnap traffic congestion on the rate of synthesis of mrna .",
    "the steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of a rnap are intrinsically stochastic and give rise to fluctuations in the rates of synthesis of mrna .",
    "we introduce quantitative measures of these fluctuations by drawing analogy with some further concepts from traffic science @xcite .",
    "we define the _ run time _",
    "@xmath0 of a rnap to be the actual time it takes to travel from the start site to the stop site on the dna template ( i.e. , the time taken to synthesize an mrna transcript ) .",
    "similarly , we define the _ time - headway _",
    "@xmath1 to be the time interval between the departures of two successive rnaps from the stop site on the dna template ( i.e. , the time interval between the completion of the synthesis of successive mrna transcripts ) . using the stochastic model which we develope here for rnap traffic",
    ", we also compute the distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of run - times and time - headways respectively .    in recent years , stochasticity in gene expression has been probed by novel experimental techniques and the results have inspired several theoretical models at different levels of complexity @xcite .",
    "the cell - to - cell variations in the levels of expression of the same gene can arise from inherently intrinsic fluctuations in transcription and translation or from extrinsic causes @xcite .",
    "since proteins are the final products of gene expression , normally , fluctuations in the concentration of proteins are taken as a measure of the noise in gene expression .",
    "however , the most direct way to measure transcriptional noise would be to monitor the fluctuations in the synthesis of mrna transcripts @xcite .",
    "therefore , instead of modeling cell - to - cell variations in the transcription of a specific gene , in this paper we study the rnap - to - rnap fluctuations in the synthesis of mrna from a single dna template .",
    "the width of the distributions @xmath2 and @xmath3 provide measures of the contributions to transcriptional noise from the intrinsic fluctuations in the steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of rnaps on the same dna template .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - bioold ]",
    "we summarize the essential mechano - chemical processes involved in transcription . in the same section",
    "we also present a brief review of some of the relevant earlier models .",
    "our stochastic model is developed in section [ sec - model ] .",
    "our theoretical predictions on flux and average density profiles , which follow from this model under periodic and open boundary conditions , are discussed in the sections [ sec - pbc ] and [ sec - obc ] , respectively .",
    "our results on fluctuations and transcriptional noise are presented in section [ sec - fluc ] .",
    "the experimental implications of our theoretical predictions are discussed in section [ sec - expt ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - conclude ] we summarize our main theoretical predictions .",
    "dna and rna are linear polymers whose monomeric subunits are called nucleotides . transcription , i.e. , the process of synthesis of mrna from the corresponding ssdna template , can be broadly divided into three stages , namely , _ initiation _ ,",
    "_ elongation _ and _ termination_. in the initiation stage , an rnap recognizes the so - called `` promoter sequence '' on the dna and locally unzips the two dna strands creating a `` bubble '' whereby a ssdna template is exposed to it .",
    "however , in this paper we are interested mainly in the elongation of the mrna transcript .    during elongation @xcite ,",
    "each successful addition of a nucleotide to the elongating mrna leads to a forward stepping of the rnap .",
    "the rnap , together with the dna bubble and the growing rna transcript , forms a `` transcription elongation complex '' ( tec ) .",
    "the essential components of each of the tecs are shown explicitly in the schematic depiction of rnap traffic in fig.[fig - rnaptraf](a ) . as reported in the literature @xcite , the typical size of a transcription bubble is about @xmath4 nucleotides ( i.e. , about @xmath5 nm )",
    "whereas a single rnap covers a dna segment that can be as long as @xmath6 nucleotides ( i.e. , about @xmath7 nm ) .",
    "the non - template dna strand remains in single - stranded conformation in the bubble region while a @xmath8-@xmath9 nucleotide - long dna - rna hetero - duplex is formed by a part of the template dna strand and the growing end of the rna ( see fig.[fig - rnaptraf](a ) ) .",
    "each mechano - chemical cycle of the rnap during the elongation stage @xcite consists of several steps ; the major steps being ( i ) nucleoside triphosphate ( ntp ) binding to the active site of the rnap when the active site is located at the growing tip of the mrna transcript , ( ii ) ntp hydrolysis , ( iii ) release of pyrophosphate ( @xmath10 ) , one of the products of hydrolysis , and ( iv ) accompanying forward stepping of the rnap @xcite .",
    "this simplified scenario , which is adequete for our purpose here , is shown symbolically in equation ( [ eq - cycle ] ) :    @xmath11    the elongation process ends when the tec encounters the corresponding `` termination sequence '' and the nascent mrna is released by the rnap .",
    "a stochastic chemical kinetic model was developed by jlicher and bruinsma @xcite to describe not only the polymerization of mrna by a rnap , but also to account for the effects of elastic strain in the motor .",
    "almost simultaneously , wang et al.@xcite developed a model that incorporated the multi - step chemical kinetics of the transcription elongation process . extending von hippel s @xcite pioneering works on sequence - dependent thermodynamic analysis of transcription , wang and collaborators",
    "@xcite have developed a sequence - dependent kinetic model in terms of a transcription - energy landscape .",
    "this model has been extended further by tadigotla et al .",
    "@xcite by incorporating the kinetic barriers erected by the folding of the mrna transcript . very recently , bai et al.@xcite have demonstrated the predictive power of their theoretical model carrying out experiment and data analysis in two stages : in the first they estimated the model parameters from experimental exploration of the response to chemical perturbations , and , then , in the second stage using these parameters they predicted the responses to mechanical perturbations .",
    "but , as stated in the introduction , none of these models incorporate steric interactions between the rnaps .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the first model of molecular motor traffic was developed almost forty years ago by macdonald , gibbs and collaborators @xcite in the context of ribosome traffic . in the pioneering works @xcite , as well as in most of the extensions in recent years",
    "@xcite , the details of molecular composition and achitecture as well as the mechano - chemical cycles of the ribosomes were not taken into account . instead ,",
    "each ribosome was modelled as a hard rod ; in the special limit where the size of the rod coincides with the lattice constant , this model reduces to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) which is the simplest model of interacting self - propelled particles . very recently , a more realistic model @xcite of ribosome traffic has been developed by incorporating the essenial steps in the mechano - chemical cycle of a ribosome during the elongation of the protein .",
    "traffic of some other families of motors have also been modelled recently in the same spirit , i.e. , by incorporating both the intra - motor mechano - chemistry and inter - motor steric interactions @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) +   + ( b ) +    for the purpose of quantitative modeling , we simplify the schematic picture of rnap traffic shown in fig.[fig - rnaptraf](a ) .",
    "we represent the dna track for rnap motors by a one - dimensional lattice and each tec by a rectangular box ( see fig.[fig - rnaptraf](b ) ) .",
    "although the actual size of a tec may be slightly larger than that of the associated rnap , from now onwards , in this paper we shall ignore this size difference .",
    "in other words , we assume that the size of the black box in the fig.[fig - rnaptraf](b ) is identical to that of a tec as well as that of a rnap motor .",
    "we label the sites of the lattice by the integer index @xmath12 ( by convention , from left to right ) .",
    "the sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the start and stop sites , respectively .",
    "each of the remaining sites in between the start and stop sites ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) represents a single nucleotide on the dna template .",
    "the size of a single rnap is such that each motor can simultaneously cover @xmath16 successive nucleotides on the dna template ( usually , @xmath16 is typically @xmath17 to @xmath6 base pairs , but in fig[fig - rnaptraf ] @xmath18 ) .",
    "according to our convention , the position of each rnap is denoted by the integer index of the lattice site covered by the leftmost site of the rnap .",
    "thus , the allowed range of the positions @xmath19 of each rnap is @xmath20 .",
    "the hard - core steric interactions among the rnaps is captured by imposing the condition that no lattice site is allowed to be covered simultaneously by more than one rnap .",
    "irrespective of the actual numerical value of @xmath16 , each rnap can move forward or backward by only one site in each time step , if demanded by its own mechano - chemistry , provided the target site is not already covered by any other rnap .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that a rnap must transcribe the successive nucleotides one by one .",
    "the total number of rnaps on the dna template is denoted by the symbol @xmath21 . under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , @xmath21 is independent of time whereas @xmath21 is a fluctuating time - dependent quantity if open boundary conditions ( obc ) are imposed on the system .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 is the _ number density _ of the rnaps",
    ". the _ coverage density _ is defined by @xmath23 which is the total fraction of the nucleotides covered by all the rnaps together . under obc ,",
    "the number density as well as the coverage density are , in general , fluctuating quantities , but the average of these densities attain time - independent values in the stationary state .",
    "our model is aimed at the elongation stage and is not intended to describe the initiation and termination processes in detail .",
    "therefore , we represent initiation and termination by the two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "whenever the site @xmath13 on the dna template is vacant , this site is allowed to be occupied by a new rnap with the probability @xmath24 in the time interval @xmath26 ( in all our numerical calculations we take @xmath27s ) .",
    "similarly , a rnap bound to the site @xmath14 is allowed to detach from the template with the probability @xmath25 in the time interval @xmath26 . for convenience",
    ", we also define the probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath29 for attachment and detachment , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath28 is related to @xmath24 by the relation @xmath30 ; @xmath29 is related to @xmath25 by a similar relation .    following wang et al.@xcite",
    ", we have a simplified description of the chemical ( or , conformational ) states of each individual rnap .",
    "since release of @xmath10 is the rate limiting step in the process of elongation of the mrna transcript , we consider only two , effectively distinct , chemical states of the rnap in each mechano - chemical cycle during the elongation stage . in the state",
    "labelled by the integer index @xmath31 no @xmath10 is bound to the rnap whereas the @xmath10-bound state of the rnap is labelled by the index @xmath32",
    ". the simplified scheme , that captures the essential mechano - chemical processes during the mrna transcript elongation , is shown in fig.[fig - rnaptm1 ] . in this figure ,",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the rates of polymerization of rna in three diferrent situations , namely , by the hydrolysis of nucleotides ( i ) on the rnap , ( ii ) in solution ( while no @xmath10 is bound to the rnap and ( iii ) in solution , while @xmath10 is bound to the rnap .",
    "the corresponding rates of reverse transitions , which result in depolymerization of the rna , are denoted by the symbols @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the rates of association and dissociation , respectively , of @xmath10 .",
    "`` backtracking '' and `` hypertracking '' of rnap have been observed in _ in - vitro _ single - rnap experiments @xcite .",
    "effects of backtrackings on transcription has been investigated recently by voliotis et al.@xcite . however , the model used by voliotis et al .",
    "@xcite does not explicitly capture the biochemical transitions of a rnap during its enzymatic cycle .",
    "interestingly , it has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite that backtracking of a rnap gets strongly suppressed if there is another rnap close behind it .",
    "therefore , we do not allow the possibility of backtracking in our model as , except at extremely low densities of rnaps , backtrackings and hypertrackings are expected to be rare in rnap traffic .",
    "four different types of nucleotides are used by nature to synthesize all dna molecules .",
    "sequence inhomogeneity can lead to site - dependent rates of translocation of rnap on its track . in the context of tasep , which is a special limit of our model of rnap traffic ,",
    "effects of quenched random site - dependent hopping rates @xcite , have been investigated extensively over the last decade .",
    "moreover , brownian motors with quenched disorder @xcite have also been studied . in the same spirit , single molecular motors , which move on dna or rna tracks ,",
    "have been modelled assuming the nucleotide sequence on the track to be random @xcite .    however , to our knowledge , for the realistic inhomogeneous , but correlated , sequences no analytical technique is available at present for the calculation of the quantities of our interest in this paper .",
    "in fact , the theoretical schemes developed so far for single rnaps @xcite , which take into account the actual sequence of the specific dna track , are implemented numerically . even in the context of earlier models of protein synthesis ,",
    "almost all the theoretical results on the effects of sequence inhomogeneities have been obtained by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the sake of ease of analytical calculations , throughout this paper we have ignored the sequence inhomogeneity of the nucleotides on the dna template and , instead , assumed a hypothetical homogeneous sequence .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the probability that there is a rnap at the spatial position @xmath12 and in the chemical state @xmath42 at time @xmath43 ; @xmath44 refers to the state in which the rnap is not bound to any @xmath10 whereas @xmath45 corresponds to the state with bound @xmath10 . note that @xmath46 is the probability of finding a rnap at the site @xmath12 , irrespective of its chemical state .",
    "similarly , @xmath47 is the probability of finding a rnap in the chemical state @xmath42 irrespective of its spatial position .",
    "we describe the stochastic dynamics of the system in terms of master equations for @xmath41 .",
    "most of our analytical results have been derived using the mean - field approximation .    in order to test the range of validity of our approximate analytical calculations ,",
    "we have also carried out extensive computer simulations ( monte carlo simulations ) of our model . in these simulations , we have used random sequential updating which appropriately corresponds to the master equations used in our analytical formalisms . in each run of the simulations ,",
    "the system was allowed to reach steady state in the first one million time steps and the data for the steady - state were collected over the next eight million time steps .",
    "the entire process was repated with large number of different initial conditions and , finally , average steady - state flux was computed .",
    "we have observed that the qualitative features of our results do not depend significantly on the actual numerical value of @xmath16 as long as is sufficiently larger than unity . therefore ,",
    "unless stated otherwise , all the numerical results plotted in this paper have been obtained taking @xmath48 . in our test simulation",
    "runs , we did not find any significant variations in the data for @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , almost all the simulation data reported here were generated in our production runs by keeping @xmath50 fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "we always denote the spatial position of a rnap on the dna track by the integer index of the site covered by the left edge of the rnap ( i.e. , the leftmost of the @xmath16 successive sites representing the rnap ) .",
    "thus , in our terminology , a site is _ occupied _ by a rnap if it coincides with the leftmost of the @xmath16 sites representing that rnap while the next @xmath52 sites on its right are said to be _ covered _ by the same rnap .",
    "let @xmath53 be the conditional probability that , given a rnap at site @xmath12 , there is another rnap at site @xmath19 ; the underlined index @xmath12 within the bracket denotes the site whose occupational status is given .",
    "obviously , @xmath54 is the conditional probability that , given a rnap at site @xmath12 , site @xmath19 is empty ; the meaning of the underlined index @xmath12 within the bracket is the same as in case of @xmath55 .",
    "note that , if site @xmath12 is given to be occupied by one rnap , the site @xmath56 can be covered by another rnap if , and only if , the site @xmath57 is also occupied .      in the mean - field approximation ,",

    "in fact , the number of chemical states in this model is equal to those in an earlier model of traffic of single - headed kinesin motors @xcite where the two chemical states , however , have totally different physical interpretations .",

    "almost all the quantitative theories of rnap developed so far @xcite were intended to account for the mechano - chemistry of a _ single _ rnap .",
    "the interactions of rnaps in transcriptional interference @xcite is a well known phenomenon and it has also been modelled quantitatively @xcite .",
    "however , instead of studying interactions of rnaps during the transcription of different genes @xcite , we have modelled the steric interactions of rnaps which are simultaneously involved in the transcription of the same gene .",
    "the possibility of steric interactions of rnaps during their traffic - like collective movements along the same dna template has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the `` christmas - tree''-like structures @xcite observed in electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic transcription arise from simultaneous transcription of the same gene by many rnaps .",
    "these structures also have strong similarity with the dense population of the nascent mrna transcripts observed all along the loops of the dna strands in the electron micrographs of lampbrush chromosomes @xcite .",
    "our theory predicts not only the average rate of synthesis of rna , but also two different measures of fluctuations in the process of transcription . in most of the earlier experimental investigations of transcriptional noise ,",
    "the distributions of the sizes and frequencies of the `` burst '' of the transcriptional activity were recorded . however ,",
    "size and frequency of the bursts depend on the temporal resolution used for _ sorting _ the time series of the events into separate bursts ( see , for example , fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in principle , the statistics of reported distributions of burst sizes and frequencies may change with the change of time resolution selected for such sorting . instead , in this paper",
    ", we have introduced new measures of the stochasticity in transcriptional activity which do not require any sorting of this kind .    in recent years sophisticated optical techniques",
    "have been developed for single mrna imaging @xcite .",
    "we believe that our theoretical predictions can be tested most appropriately by carrying out _ in - vitro _ experiments with either fluorescently labelled rnaps @xcite or using techniques for tagging the nascent mrna with fluorescent probes @xcite or using techniques where fluorescent probes can quickly bind with the nascent mrna as soon as it is released by the rnap @xcite .",
    "comparison of our theoretical predictions on the distributions of run times and time headways require collection of appropriate data . in our theory",
    ", the run time includes the time spent by a rnap in the elongation stage as well as in the termination stage , but does not include the time spent in the initiation stage .",
    "therefore , in experiments , run times of the rnaps should be measured only from the instant when the tec gets stabilized ; a technique used in ref.@xcite may be utilized for this purpose .",
    "surprisingly , no attempt has been made in the past to develope mathematical models for rnap traffic where transcription of a single gene is carried out simultaneously by a stream of rnaps closely spaced on the same dna template . to our knowledge",
    ", the model developed in this paper is the first attempt to capture inter - rnap interactions in a model where the mechano - chemical cycles of each individual rnaps in the elongation stage are also incorporated , albeit in a simplified manner . in analogy with vehicular traffic @xcite ,",
    "we have defined the flux for rnap traffic ; the rnap flux is also the total rate of synthesis of rna .",
    "we have calculated the average rates of rna synthesis analytically under mean - field approximation .    drawing analogies with vehicular traffic , we have defined two novel quantities whose distributions serve as measures of rnap - to - rnap fluctuations in the transcription of a single gene .",
    "we have calculated these distributions numerically by carrying out computer simulations of our model .",
    "the widths of these distributions ( more precisely , root - mean - square fluctuations ) can be treated as good measures of the strength of `` transcriptional noise '' .",
    "we have investigated how the level of `` transcriptional noise '' depends on some of the model parameters which can be varied in a controlled manner in laboratory experiments . a similar analysis of `` translational noise '' , which arises from ribosome - to - ribosome fluctuations during protein synthesis from the same mrna template ,",
    "will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous sequence of nucleotides on the dna template can lead to stronger fluctuations thereby making additional contributions to the levels of transcriptional noise .",
    "the `` intrinsic noise '' studied in this paper arises from the stochastic nature of the steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of individual rnaps .",
    "although the noise level gets affected by the interactions of the rnaps , this noise remains relevant even when the gene is transcribed by one rnap at a time .",
    "we have made concrete suggestions as to the experimental systems and techniques which , in principle , can be used to test our theoretical predictions . + * acknowledgements * : one of the authors ( dc ) thanks ido golding , stephan grill , anatoly kolomeisky , tannie liverpool , alex mogilner , evgeny nudler , george oster , arjun raj and gunter schtz for useful comments and/or suggestions on the manuscript .",

    "<S> rna polymerase ( rnap ) is an enzyme that synthesizes a messenger rna ( mrna ) strand which is complementary to a single - stranded dna template . from the perspective of physicists , </S>",
    "<S> an rnap is a molecular motor that utilizes chemical energy input to move along the track formed by a dna . in many circumstances , which are described in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> a large number of rnaps move simultaneously along the same track ; we refer to such collective movements of the rnaps as rnap traffic . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theoretical model for rnap traffic by incorporating the steric interactions between rnaps as well as the mechano - chemical cycle of individual rnaps during the elongation of the mrna . by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques , we calculate the rates of mrna synthesis and the average density profile of the rnaps on the dna track . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce , and compute , two new measures of fluctuations in the synthesis of rna . analyzing these fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> we show how the level of _ intrinsic noise _ in mrna synthesis depends on the concentrations of the rnaps as well as on those of some of the reactants and the products of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by rnap . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest appropriate experimental systems and techniques for testing our theoretical predictions . </S>"
