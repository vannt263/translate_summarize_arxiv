    "according to the large extra - dimension scenario , there exists a chance for higher dimensional black holes to be created at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "hence , the higher dimensional black holes have been intensively investigated .",
    "it should be noted that the einstein theory of gravity is not the most general one in higher dimensions . in four dimensions ,",
    "the einstein gravity can be deduced by assuming the general coordinate covariance and the absence of higher derivative terms larger than the second order in the lagrangian . in higher dimensions , however , the same assumptions lead to lovelock theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this mathematical motivation , we have a physical motivation to consider lovelock gravity .",
    "in fact , at the energy scale of black hole production , the einstein gravity is not reliable any more .",
    "it is widely believed that string theory is valid at the fundamental scale .",
    "remarkably , string theory can be consistently formulated only in ten dimensions .",
    "as is well known , string theory reduces to einstein gravity in the low energy limit . in string theory , however , there are higher curvature corrections in addition to the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "thus , it is natural to extend einstein gravity into those with higher power of curvature in higher dimensions .",
    "it is lovelock gravity that belongs to such class of theories . in lovelock gravity",
    ", it is known that there exist static spherically symmetric black holes  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to suppose black holes produced at the lhc are of this type .    in five or six dimensions",
    ", the lovelock gravity reduces to the so - called gauss - bonnet gravity which has static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis of gauss - bonnet black holes under scalar , vector , and tensor perturbations has been performed  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that there exists the scalar mode instability in five dimensions , the tensor mode instability in six dimensions , and no instability in other dimensions  @xcite . in more than six dimensions , however , we need to consider more general lovelock gravity . for example , when we consider ten dimensional black holes , we need to incorporate the third and fourth order lovelock terms into the action .",
    "indeed , when we consider black holes at the lhc , it is important to consider these higher order lovelock terms .",
    "the stability of black holes in any order lovelock gravity has been studied  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that small black holes are unstable in any dimensions .    in order to understand properties of black holes in lovelock gravity , it is important to study qnms of black holes .",
    "the qnfs of gauss - bonnet gravity have already been investigated  @xcite .",
    "thus , the aim of this paper is to calculate qnfs of the stable large black holes in lovelock gravity using the wkb method  @xcite .",
    "the qnfs of lovelock black holes have been calculated for the special background  @xcite .",
    "since the metric is analytically known for such cases , there is no difficulty in using the wkb - method for obtaining qnfs . in general , however , a problem arises because the metric of the black hole is only implicitly given by an algebraic equation .",
    "hence , the primary aim of this paper is to give a general formalism to calculate qnfs of black holes in lovelock gravity .",
    "the other purpose of this paper is to calculate qnfs of lovelock black holes in seven and eight dimensions and reveal effects of higher order lovelock terms on qnfs .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce lovelock gravity and lovelock black holes . in sec .",
    "iii , we review the perturbation theory of lovelock black holes . in sec .",
    "iv , we explain the wkb method for obtaining qnfs .",
    "there , we propose a novel method adapted to lovelock gravity for calculating qnfs .",
    "then , we present numerical results and extract many interesting features from the results .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly review lovelock gravity in higher dimensions  @xcite and derive static black hole solutions determined by an algebraic equation .",
    "lovelock gravity is characterized by the general coordinate covariance and the absence of terms with higher than the second order derivatives in the equations of motion .",
    "the lagrangian satisfying these properties can be constructed from @xmath0th lovelock terms @xmath1 defined by the product of riemann tensors _ ( m ) ^_1 _ 1 _ m _ m__1 _ 1 _ m _ m r^_1 _ 1 _ _ 1 _ 1 r^_m _ m _ _ m _ m  , where we used the totally antisymmetric kronecker delta ^_1 _ p__1 _ p |    cccc ^_1__1 & ^_2__1 & & ^_p__1 + ^_1__2 & ^_2__2 & & ^_p__2 + & & & + ^_1__p & ^_2__p & & ^_p__p     @xmath2 is written by _ d",
    "-2 + ^k_m=1 _ ( m )  , where @xmath3 is a cosmological constant , @xmath4 represents the coupling constants of lovelock gravity and @xmath5 is a parameter defined by k .",
    "this lagrangian is called the lovelock lagrangian .",
    "we can set @xmath6 without losing generality .",
    "the action obviously has the general coordinate invariance .",
    "it is also straightforward to see the absence of higher derivative terms larger than the second order derivatives . performing the variation with respect to the metric",
    ", we obtain the lovelock tensor @xmath7 defined as ^d _",
    "= ^ _ - ^k_m=1 ^_1 _ 1 _ m _ m__1 _ 1 _ m _ m r^_1 _ 1 _ _ 1 _ 1 r^_m _ m _ _ m _ m  , where we used the bianchi indentity to eliminate the terms with derivative of the riemann tensor .",
    "this tensor is equal to the einstein tensor in @xmath8 and the einstein - gauss - bonnet tensor in @xmath9 .",
    "thus , lovelock theory can be regarded as a natural generalization of einstein theory .",
    "it is known that there exist static black hole solutions in lovelock gravity  @xcite . to obtain the solutions",
    ", we put an ansatz ds^2 = g _",
    "x^ x^ = - f(r ) t^2 + r^2 + r^2 _ ij x^i x^j  , where @xmath10 is the metric of the sphere in @xmath11 dimensions . using this ansatz",
    ", we can calculate the lovelock tensor which must be zero in vacuum .",
    "it is convenient to define a new variable @xmath12 as ( r ) =  .",
    "then , we can integrate equations of motion and obtain ( ) =  , [ algebraic_eq ] where the polynomial @xmath13 is defined as ( ) = \\ {    c - ( k=1 )  , +   + ^k_q=2 + - ( k 2 )  .    .",
    "[ kettei ] here , @xmath14 is related to adm mass of black hole as follows : m_adm  .    in this paper , we will focus on the asymptotically flat spacetime . to realize the asymptotically flat spacetime , we set @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 becomes a monotonically increasing function of @xmath17 with zero at @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath18 is achieved at @xmath19 , we can realize asymptotically flat spacetime with this setup .",
    "it should be stressed that eq.([algebraic_eq ] ) implicitly define @xmath20 , namely , the metric function @xmath21 . in other words , we can not obtain the metric in an analytic form in general .",
    "in the previous section , we have presented black hole solutions in lovelock gravity .",
    "now , we consider a scalar field on this spacetime and linear metric perturbations around this background spacetime . we show that there exists a master equation in any case .",
    "the master equation is an equation for the master variable by which all other components of the metric can be derived . in the case of the scalar field ,",
    "the master equation is nothing but the klein - gordon equation . in the case of metric perturbations",
    ", one can also obtain the master equations .",
    "the explicit relation between the master variable and the other metric components can be found in @xcite .",
    "once we obtain the master equations which are separable , we can analyze the stability of black holes and calculate qnfs of black holes .",
    "since we are considering static background , the time - dependence of the fields can be separated by the factor e^-i t  . moreover , due to the spherical symmetry , angular dependence of the master variable can be separated by using harmonics on the sphere .",
    "thus , the master equation can be reduced to the schr@xmath22dinger type equation for the radial direction as + ( x ) = 0  , where we have defined the tortoise coordinate @xmath23 as follows : =  ,    for quasinormal mode analysis , the shape of the effective potential @xmath24 is our main objective . in the rest of this section",
    ", we write down the various effective potentials we will use in this paper .",
    "as we mentioned , the master equation of a scalar field is the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the klein - gordon equation with the mass @xmath25 in curved spacetime reads ( t , r , ) = 0  , where @xmath26 represents the coordinates in a @xmath27-dimensional sphere .",
    "the spectrum of spherical harmonics @xmath28 on a @xmath27-dimensional sphere is given by y_l ( ) = - l(l+n-1 ) y_l ( )  , with an integer @xmath29 .",
    "after separating variables , we obtain the following equation + ( x ) = 0  . here , a prime represents a differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , in this case we get the effective potential as follows : v(r ) = f(r ) ( ^2 + f(r ) + f(r ) + )  .",
    "the metric perturbations in lovelock gravity was fully analyzed in @xcite .",
    "there , the metric perturbations are classified into tensor , vector , and scalar types according to the symmetry on the sphere",
    ". then , the master equations for metric perturbations of tensor- , vector- , and scalar - type have been derived . in this article",
    ", we simply use the effective potentials obtained in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 defined by t(r ) & & r^n-1 _ ( )  , + x(r ) & &  . for the absence of the ghost ,",
    "we need to assume @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "we call it the @xmath35-condition .",
    "the master equation for tensor type perturbations can be written as v_t(r ) = f(r )  .",
    "it is known that there exists the instability of small black holes under tensor perturbations in even dimensions .",
    "the master equation for vector perturbations reads v_v(r ) = f(r )  .",
    "there exists no instability in this sector .",
    "finally , the master equation for scalar perturbations takes the following form v_s(r ) & = & f(r )  . in this case",
    ", it is also known that there exists the instability of small black holes under scalar perturbations in odd dimensions .",
    "the lovelock black holes are unstable in various ways .",
    "the instability of black holes caused by the ghost is characterized by the violation of the @xmath35-condition .",
    "as we mentioned , there are other types of instability under tensor and scalar type perturbations .",
    "the instability comes from the negative region of the effective potential . for this class of black holes",
    ", we can not use the wkb method because this method can be applicable to the positive definite effective potential with single peak . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the qnfs of stable black holes by excluding the cases with the negative regions or with the multipeaks in the potential .",
    "in this section , we present a novel method for the calculation of quasinormal modes in lovelock gravity .",
    "quasinormal modes are fundamental vibration modes around a black hole . these modes are obtained by solving the master equation under the appropriate boundary condition .",
    "the general formalism of calculating qnfs by using wkb - approximation has been proposed by schutz and will  @xcite and subsequently developed by many people @xcite . here , we summarize the main points of the wkb - method for qnfs .    in general , we can divide the region into two regions . the region @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the one ranging from top of the effective potential @xmath38 to the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the region @xmath39",
    "( @xmath40 ) is the one ranging from top of the potential @xmath38 to the far outside of the black hole , i.e. , infinity .",
    "the wave traveling to the potential is called an ingoing wave and the wave traveling from the potential is called outgoing wave . in each region , the solutions of the master equation can be expressed as \\ {",
    "c _ i = z^in_i^in_i + z^out_i ^out_i  , +   + _ ii = z^in_ii^in_ii + z^out_ii ^out_ii  ,    . where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent ingoing and outgoing wave , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition for obtaining quasinormal modes is that there are no ingoing waves : z^in_i = z^in_ii= 0  .",
    "since there are two conditions , only discrete complex eigenvalues are allowed .    in the @xmath43th - order wkb - method , we approximate the function @xmath44 defined by q(x ) ^2 - v(x ) . in terms of @xmath45th - order taylor expansion around the maximum of the potential as follows ; .",
    "|_x = x_0=q^(1)_0 = 0 q(x ) ^2n_p=0 q^(p)_0 ( x - x_0 ) ^p  . expressing the wave function using wkb - approximation",
    ", we can calculate the scattering matrix .",
    "thus , we can get the formula for qnfs as  , where @xmath46 is the @xmath47th order derivative of the potential v^(p)_0 .",
    "|_x = x_0  , and the first and the second of @xmath48 are given by _ 1 & = & -30 ( n_tone + ) ^2_1 ^ 2 + 6_2 ( n_tone + ) ^2 - 7/2_1 ^ 2 + 3/2_2 , + & & + _ 2 & = & ( n_tone + ) ^3 ( -2820_1 ^ 4 + 1800 _ 1 ^ 2_2 - 280_1_3 - 68_2 ^ 2 + 20_4 ) + & & + ( n_tone + ) ( -1155_1 ^ 4 + 918_1 ^ 2_2 - 190_1_3 - 67_2 ^ 2 + 25_4 )  .",
    "here , @xmath49 is defined as _",
    "p ( ) ^+1 the parameter , @xmath50 , is called tone number of quasinormal modes .",
    "this method is often called the @xmath43th - order - wkb - approximation .",
    "this time , we used the 3rd - order wkb method .",
    "so we need @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is known that in the case of @xmath53 this approximation is good .",
    "so we focused on the case @xmath54 in this paper .",
    "let us calculate qnfs of the fields in lovelock gravity semianalytically by using the wkb method . to use the wkb method , we need to know the potential function and hence the metric function @xmath21 .",
    "that is , we need to solve the @xmath5th order algebraic equation ( [ algebraic_eq ] ) for @xmath12 in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to solve the algebraic equation analytically for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "thus , we need to invent a novel method adapted to lovelock gravity .    to circumvent this difficulty , we take the following strategy . instead of solving eq .",
    "@xmath55 , we change the variable from @xmath30 to @xmath17 using the relation r =  .",
    "thus , we are able to get the analytic representation of @xmath56 as f = 1 - r^2 = 1 -  . [ f ] so , if we use this formulation , we will be able to calculate qnfs of the static and spherically symmetric black holes in lovelock gravity .",
    "now , we check the range of @xmath17 .",
    "we are considering the static spherically symmetric black hole solutions with the asymptotically flat region .",
    "when @xmath30 goes to @xmath57 , @xmath21 should be 1 because of asymptotic flatness .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath58 , we have 0  .",
    "when @xmath30 approaches the horizon , @xmath21 must vanish .",
    "hence , in this limit , we obtain ( ) ^2 = ^n+1 [ cond ]",
    ". there will be the unique real solution @xmath59 of this equation because we know @xmath13 is the monotonic increasing function of @xmath17 .",
    "to summarize , we obtained the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath17 as follow : \\ {    cccc r : & horizon & & + : & _ h & & 0    . .",
    "in this region of @xmath17 , we must find @xmath60 which satisfy the equation , v^(1)_0 = 0  .",
    "once we find it , we can use the wkb method and calculate qnfs of lovelock black holes .",

    "we calculated the qnfs for various values of @xmath70 using the third order wkb method .",
    "note that we fixed the @xmath3 parameter to zero and considered a massless scalar field ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we calculated qnfs only for the cases like in fig.[gp ] .",
    "namely , the potential is positive definite in the range @xmath72 and has a single peak .",
    "for some parameters , the effective potential has the multipeaks or the negative region ( fig.[nrdp ] ) .",
