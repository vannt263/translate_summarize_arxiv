    "accordingly , there are @xmath6 split ( different ) swihart velocities @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( see , refs .  ) such that @xmath9 . for example , in the simplest case of two coupled junctions , there are two swihart velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , which correspond , respectively , to the system s in - phase and out - of - phase josephson plasma wave eigenmodes . in the @xmath6-fold stack ,",
    "we also use notation @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are the smallest and largest swihart velocities .",
    "an important issue is to study the conditions for the existence and stability of a single - fluxon state in the stacked system .",
    "it is implied that the fluxon is trapped in one junction and its screening currents spread over neighboring junctions .",
    "the fluxon induces , through the magnetic coupling , `` images '' in adjacent layers , so that a full solution for the single fluxon state in the stack includes both the core topological soliton in the central layer and its non - topological images in the other layers .",

    "it was first suggested@xcite , and recently demonstrated theoretically and experimentally@xcite , that a fluxon may nevertheless move in a multilayer system with a velocity which exceeds the minimum phase velocity of the plasma waves .",
    "it is important to find the maximum fluxon velocity @xmath16 and its dependence on the parameters of the system .",
    "a possibility of having @xmath17 is especially interesting , as it implies steady motion of the fluxon at @xmath18 with cherenkov radiation tail of josephson plasma waves behind it .",

    ", we recall that the set of the split swihart velocities can be found in an exact form from the linearized version of eqs .",

    "these velocities are given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath76 it is also useful to find the values of the parameter @xmath77 corresponding to the minimum velocity @xmath78 and the maximum velocity among all the velocities given by eq .",

    "@xmath96 coupled equations can be reduced to @xmath6 equations in the same way as we reduced 3 equations for @xmath24 to only 2 independent equations . as a result of this reduction , the @xmath6-th equation , which describes the junction containing the fluxon and corresponds to the last row of matrix ( [ eq : matrix ] ) , contains the factor of 2 .",
    "the values of @xmath97 calculated for some @xmath6 are summarized in table  [ tab : sigma_min ] .",
    "one can see that as @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "similar to the above considerations , the single - fluxon state exists only if @xmath100 .",
    "note that this is , actually , quite a noteworthy result , which means that , for any @xmath101 , the steady motion of the fluxon accompanied by the emission of the cherenkov radiation is possible at @xmath102 , _",

    "analytically , it can not be reduced just to looking for solutions of unperturbed equation in the form @xmath109 . therefore , direct numerical simulations are necessary to get an insight into the problem .",
    "the pde s ( [ eq:2:phi0 ] ) and ( [ eq:2:phi1 ] ) for @xmath21 or ( [ eq : sym3:0 ] ) and ( [ eq : sym3:pm1 ] ) for @xmath24 were solved numerically using an explicit method [ expressing @xmath110 as a function of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and treating @xmath113 with a five - point , @xmath114 with a three - point and @xmath115 with a two - point symmetric finite - difference scheme@xcite .",

    "the following convergence criterion was adopted : the difference between the voltages obtained by averaging over two successive time intervals must not exceed @xmath123 . when the average voltage corresponding to the current @xmath55 is found , the current is increased by a small amount @xmath124 to calculate the voltages at the next point of the ivc .",
    "we use the phases ( and their derivatives ) attained in the previous point of the ivc as the initial conditions for the next point . by gradually increasing @xmath55 and ,",
    "thus , @xmath53 , we encountered a maximum value @xmath16 of @xmath53 above which the single - fluxon mode becomes unstable , and the system switches into a resistive state .",

    "this will produce an _ effective lagrangian _ as a function of free parameters that the ansatz contains .",
    "finally , the values of this parameters will be found from the condition that they must realize an extremum of the effective lagrangian .",
    "thus , it is necessary to select a tractable ansatz ( that admits an analytical calculation of the integrals in the expression for the lagrangian ) , which satisfies the above boundary conditions for the fluxon . here , both when selecting the ansatz and considering the boundary conditions , we ignore the above - mentioned nonvanishing cherenkov oscillatory tails ( note that the tail is formally infinitely long in the ideal model with @xmath137 , while in the damped system the tail decays exponentially far from the fluxon s `` body '' ) .",

    "<S> dynamics of a fluxon in a stack of inductively coupled long josephson junctions is studied analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the fluxon has a maximum velocity , which does not necessarily coincide with any of the characteristic josephson plasma wave velocities . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum fluxon velocity is found by means of numerical simulations of the quasi - infinite system . using the variational approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a simple analytical formula for the dependence of the fluxon s maximum velocity on the coupling constant and on the distribution of critical currents in different layers . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis yields rather precise results in the limit of small dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations also show that nonzero dissipation additionally stabilizes the fluxon . </S>"
