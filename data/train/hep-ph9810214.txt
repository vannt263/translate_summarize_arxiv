    "the gauge bosons and higgs bosons superpartners have every chance to play , in the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , an important part in the first direct experimental evidence for supersymmetry , if the latter happens to be linearly realized in nature around the electroweak scale .",
    "this would go through the study of the direct production of the light states and their subsequent decays , eventually cascading down to leptons ( or jets ) and missing energy @xcite@xmath2@xcite@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the chargino / neutralino sector is an over - constrained system in the sense that only a few basic parameters in the lagrangian are needed to determine all the six physical masses and the mixing angles of the various states .",
    "the latter determine the couplings to gauge bosons , higgs bosons and matter fermions , so that various phenomenological tests could be in principle envisaged in the process of experimental identification .",
    "alternatively , one might hope that a partial experimental knowledge of this sector would be sufficient to allow a reasonably unequivocal reconstruction of the full set of parameters ; at stakes , on one hand the determination of the magnitude of the fermion soft susy breaking parameters , on the other , the existence of a heavy neutral stable particle , of prime importance to the cold dark matter issue @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity to @xmath1 , the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , and to the supersymmetric parameter @xmath3 , brings in a further correlation with the other sectors of the mssm .",
    "+ hereafter we describe two strategies : the first deals with the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath5 form the study of the lightest chargino pair production and decay in @xmath6 collisions @xcite , the second with the extraction of @xmath7 and @xmath3 form the knowledge of any three ino masses and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we start by stating the common features to these complementary approaches as well as their specific assumptions .",
    "we then highlight the main ingredients of each of them and illustrate some of their results .",
    "finally we show in what sense they eventually complement one another .",
    "[ obviously , the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for more details and references .",
    "still , we add some comments at various places of the ongoing presentation , which differ slightly from , and hopefully complete , the latter references . ] + the reconstruction of the basic parameters of the theory involves generically two steps which can be sketched as follows : + @xmath8 each of these steps can suffer from equivocal reconstructions due to partial experimental knowledge or to theoretical ambiguities . in the present report we concentrate on the theoretical aspects of both steps .",
    "the ino sector is considered in both @xcite ( referred to as cddkz ) and @xcite ( km ) with the following assumptions :    * no reference to model - dependent assumptions about physics at energies much higher than the electroweak scale , like the gut scale , and their possible implication on the parameters of this sector .",
    "[ thus the study is mainly carried out in the unconstrained mssm , but any model - assumptions can be easily overlaid . ] * r - parity conservation ; * cp - conservation in the ino sector ; this assumption is here only for practical reasons and should be eventually removed in future studies in order to cope with the possibility to deal with ( complex ) phases @xcite ; * cddkz and km choose @xmath9 .",
    "this is of course a mere convention due to the partial phase freedom through redefinition of fields , the only physical signs being the relative ones among @xmath7 and @xmath3 as one can easily see from the relevant terms in the lagrangian .",
    "( also @xmath1 is taken positive and the @xmath3 term convention is that of ref.[@xcite ] . )    let us now recall briefly the basic ingredients of the ino mass matrices .",
    "the physical charginos ( resp .",
    "neutralinos ) are mixtures of charged ( resp .",
    "neutral ) higgsino and gaugino components .",
    "the chargino mass matrix reads :    @xmath10    it has a supersymmetric contribution coming from the @xmath3 term in the superpotential , the higgsino component , a contribution from the soft susy breaking wino mass term , and off - diagonal terms due to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "since @xmath11 is not symmetric one needs two independent unitary matrices for the diagonalization .",
    "this is but the reflection of the fact that there are two independent mixings involving separately the two higgsino @xmath12 doublets .",
    "the eigenvalues are most easily obtained from the diagonalization of @xmath13 giving the squares of the chargino masses :    @xmath14 \\end{array}\\label{chmass}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the angles @xmath15 defining the two independent left- and right- chiral mixings among the winos and higgsinos in the four component dirac representation are given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the lightest chargino mass given by eq.([chmass ] ) .",
    "this form of the mixing angles is such that the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are always positive definite .",
    "+ the neutralino mass matrix corresponds to bilinear terms in the photino , zino and neutral higgsino two - component fields .",
    "it receives contributions from the @xmath3 term , the soft mass terms of the gaugino @xmath12 triplet @xmath18 and singlet @xmath19 , while the mixing among states is triggered by the electroweak symmetry breaking :    @xmath20    in contrast with @xmath11 , @xmath21 is symmetric so that it can be diagonalized with one unitary matrix . on the other hand",
    "the eigenmasses are not positive definite .",
    "finally we note that in general the diagonalization of @xmath21 can not be achieved through a similarity transformation , unless all three parameters @xmath7 and @xmath3 are real",
    ". this will be a key point in the algorithm we present for the reconstruction of the parameters in the neutralino sector .",
    "the lightest chargino @xmath22 can be produced in pairs in @xmath6 collisions , at lepii @xcite or nlc @xcite energies , through @xmath23 and @xmath24 s - channel exchange as well as sneutrino t - channel exchange .",
    "the production cross section will thus depend on the chargino mass @xmath25 , the sneutrino mass @xmath26 and the mixing angles , eq.([mixing ] ) , which determine the couplings of the chargino states to the @xmath24 and the sneutrino .",
    "the unpolarized total cross section is illustrated in fig.1 with three representative cases of higgsino , gaugino or mixed content of the lightest chargino mass .",
    "the sharp rise near threshold should allow a precise determination of the chargino mass .",
    "also the sensitivity to the sneutrino mass with the typical destructive interference in the gaugino and mixed cases necessitates the knowledge of this parameter .",
    "+ subsequently the chargino will decay directly to a pair of matter fermions ( leptons or quarks ) and the ( stable ) lightest neutralino , through the exchange of a @xmath27 boson ( charged higgs exchange is suppressed for light fermions ) or scalar partners of leptons or quarks .",
    "of course the decay matrix elements will depend on further parameters like the susy scalar masses and couplings to the neutralino .",
    "however , cddkz propose that , looking at the total production cross section and some polarization components and spin - spin correlations of the final state charginos , one can define measurable combinations for which the details of the chargino decay products cancel out .",
    "this allows to isolate to a large extent the chargino system from the neutralino system and thus extract the mixing angles and chargino mass from these observables ( step ( i ) in eq.([phil ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , for step ( i ) to work completely for the chargino system , one needs to know , besides the sneutrino mass , _ also the lightest neutralino mass _ , as will become clear later on .",
    "once the chargino mass @xmath28 and @xmath29 are known one can determine @xmath4 and @xmath1 up to possible ambiguities , [ step ( ii ) of eq.([phil ] ) . ]",
    "+ before going further let us first describe in some detail the basic ingredients of step ( i ) .",
    "the presence of invisible neutralinos , in the final state of the process @xmath30 , makes it impossible to measure directly the chargino production angle in the laboratory frame . from now on we will thus concentrate on observables where this angle is integrated out . integrating also over the invariant masses of the fermionic systems @xmath31 and @xmath32 one can write the differential cross section in the following form :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the fine structure constant , @xmath35 the velocity of the chargino in the c.m .",
    "frame , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) denotes the polar angle of the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) system in the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) rest frame with respect to the charginos flight direction in the laboratory frame , and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) the corresponding azimuthal angle with respect to a canonical production plane .",
    "@xmath44 is made out of combinations of helicity amplitudes which lead to an unpolarized term plus fifteen other contributions from polarization components and spin - spin correlations .",
    "we reproduce here only those components which are relevant to our discussion .",
    "@xmath45    actually , among the sixteen terms which contribute to @xmath46 only ten survive because of cp - invariance ( when violation of cp from the z - boson width or radiative corrections is neglected ) .",
    "of these ten , three are redundant being cp eigenstates . of the remaining seven independent components , only those which can be extracted from experimentally measurable angular distributions",
    "are explicitly written in eq.([sigma ] ) .",
    "this means that the others will be integrated out through appropriate projections .    in eq.([sigma ] ) @xmath47 corresponds to the unpolarized cross section for the chargino pair production and is given in terms of helicity amplitudes by    @xmath48 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    @xmath49 is a polarization component coming separately from the @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) system @xmath52\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    while @xmath53 and @xmath54 describe the spin correlations between the two chargino systems and have the following structure @xmath55\\\\ & & \\\\",
    "{ \\cal y}&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int { \\rm d}\\cos\\theta\\sum_{\\sigma=\\pm }         { \\rm re}\\{\\langle\\sigma;--\\rangle\\langle\\sigma;++\\rangle^*\\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the initial state electron helicity .",
    "the strategy of cddkz is based on the following two observations :    * the three angular contributions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are fully determined by the measurable parameters @xmath59 ( the energy and momentum of each of the decay systems @xmath60 in the laboratory frame ) , and the chargino mass @xmath61 ; * the three quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 lead to @xmath64 free observables , where @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 ) measures the asymmetry between left- and right - chirality form factors in the decay products of the chargino ;    here the kinematic configuration is similar to that of a @xmath66 lepton pair production with successive decays in light leptons or quarks plus missing energy .",
    "however in the present context the invisible particle has a non negligible mass whose knowledge is necessary to relate the energy of the @xmath60 system in the chargino rest frame to that in the laboratory frame .",
    "thus the neutralino mass is actually necessary in the reconstruction of the angular contributions in _ i)_. the crucial point in _ ii ) _ is that the dependence on the final state decay fermions through the asymmetry in the left- and right- chiral structure cancels out .",
    "thus @xmath62 and @xmath63 allow to study the chargino sector independently of the details of the decay products .",
    "in the same time , their extraction from the experimental data , via convolution with appropriate moments , requires the measurement of the energies and momenta of the two @xmath67 systems , the chargino mass ( ex . via threshold effects , see fig.1 ) , as well as the neutralino mass ( ex . from the energy distribution of the final particles ) .",
    "once extracted , one can combine @xmath62 and @xmath63 which depend on the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath68 , the sneutrino mass @xmath26 , and @xmath29 to determine the latter cosines .",
    "an illustration is given in fig .",
    "2 of a unique consistent solution corresponding to the intersection point of the contour plots at @xmath69 .",
    "the requirement that the three curves should meet in one point offers clearly a very stringent consistency check of the model . on the other hand",
    ", while @xmath70 is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath71 , @xmath72 , the two other observables are quartic in these variables",
    ". a potential ambiguity in the determination of @xmath73 will be , however , very unlikely , especially if @xmath26 is fixed independently and the c.m .",
    "energy varied .",
    "we do not dwell here on further aspects of step ( i ) which can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we now go to step ( ii ) of eq.(1 ) and describe briefly how to determine @xmath4 and @xmath74 . starting from eq.([mixing ] ) and @xmath61 in eq.([chmass ] ) , cddkz give closed expressions for @xmath75 in terms of the quantities @xmath76 .",
    "they considered all possible cases and concluded to the existence of at most a two - fold ambiguity in the determination of the lagrangian parameters , traceable to a sign ambiguity in @xmath77 , ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "here we only sketch an equivalent discussion which shows that , when it occurs , this two - fold ambiguity is _ always associated with opposite @xmath3 sign solutions_. this can be most easily seen as follows : from @xmath29 in eq.([mixing ] ) one easily determines @xmath78 uniquely ( remember that @xmath78 is positive in our convention ) and @xmath3 with a global sign ambiguity , as functions of @xmath79 and @xmath72 . plugging those functions in the @xmath28 part of eq.([chmass ] ) one gets , thanks to some cancellations , a simple quadratic equation in @xmath1 .",
    "the two solutions encompass automatically the sign of @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , each of them is consistent only with ( at most ) one @xmath3 sign reproducing the correct @xmath28 , since eq.([chmass ] ) is not invariant under @xmath81 for a given @xmath82 . as a numerical illustration , taking the input of fig.2 ,",
    "@xmath83pb , @xmath84 , cddkz find the following two - fold solution @xmath85 =          \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }                ( a ) \\;\\;[1.06 ; \\ ;   83{\\rm gev } , \\ ; -59{\\rm gev } ] \\\\                    { } \\\\ { }                ( b ) \\;\\;[3.33 ; \\ ;   248{\\rm gev } , \\ ; 123{\\rm gev } ]                \\end{array}\\right . \\label{numillust}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the two - fold ambiguity comes with a sign change for @xmath3 in accord with the general pattern just described . to eliminate this discrete ambiguity",
    "one would clearly need an independent information about any of the three parameters .",
    "finally , the reconstruction obviously depends on the quality of the experimental accuracy with which the needed observables can be determined .",
    "this requires among other things :    * running at different c.m .",
    "energies : at threshold for a good determination of @xmath28 , away from threshold to increase the sensitivity to chargino polarization ; * a good reconstruction of the final state fermion systems for a good determination of the neutralino mass ; * identification of the chargino electric charge , necessary for the extraction of @xmath49 ; * an independent knowledge of the sneutrino mass , to avoid a three parameter fit to the observables ;    [ [ km ] ] km ~~    in this section we describe another strategy for extracting the lagrangian parameters @xcite .",
    "it consists in assuming that only ino masses are known . among other things",
    ", this strategy will be complementary to the one described in the previous section in the sense that it provides ( within the cddkz strategy ) an algorithm for the determination of @xmath86 , the only parameter which was not reconstructed in ref.[1 ] .",
    "km concerns mainly step ( ii ) of eq.(1 ) .",
    "the emphasis is put on the extent to which the reconstruction can be made through a controllable analytical procedure including all possible ambiguities , if three ino masses and @xmath1 were known needs to be an input is actually a marginal point here , as one can assume that this parameter has been determined from elsewhere , like for instance in @xcite or from the study of yet another sector of the mssm . ] .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the neutralino sector where the analytical reconstruction is far from trivial .",
    "the next aim in @xcite is to provide a numerical code which uses as much of the analytical solutions as possible and allows a direct reconstruction of @xmath7 and @xmath3 from the physical ino masses .",
    "we do not address here the more realistic issues when only mass differences are measured @xcite , however it is clear that the study provides a useful building block even in this case , and practically allows to avoid parameter scanning numerical procedures as well as model - dependent assumptions .",
    "km distinguish two cases :    * the two charginos and one neutralino masses are input ; * one chargino and two neutralino masses are input ;    although @xmath87 is phenomenologically less compelling than @xmath88 as far as the generic pattern of low lying states is concerned , it turns out that it leads to a full analytical reconstruction .",
    "in contrast , @xmath88 needs partly a purely numerical algorithm which is , however , minimized through the use of the @xmath87 solutions .",
    "the bottom line is that the resulting algorithms are very fast , the first being fully analytical and the second needing seldom more than a few iterations to reach numerical convergence ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "+ let us now describe briefly the solutions for @xmath87 .",
    "+   + starting from eq.([chmass ] ) one can determine analytically @xmath89 and @xmath78 in terms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "without further information in the chargino sector , @xmath3 and @xmath78 will be determined , but up to a @xmath92 ambiguity ( that is , one can not determine uniquely at this level the higgsino and gaugino content of the charginos ) .",
    "on the other hand the global sign ambiguity in @xmath3 , due to the fact that only @xmath89 is known , is actually lifted by the relation @xmath93 since @xmath78 is positive by definition .",
    "nonetheless there remains a two - fold ambiguity coming from the relative @xmath94 sign in eq.([sgnmu ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", some constraints will come from the requirement of real - valuedness of @xmath78 and @xmath3 .",
    "all these aspects are analytically delineated in @xcite in terms of domains of @xmath1 and the sum and difference of the input chargino masses .",
    "+   + let us now assume that @xmath95 and one neutralino mass have been determined , and address the question of reconstructing @xmath86 and thus the three remaining neutralino masses .",
    "it should be clear that the answer to this question is not straightforward independently of whether it can be phrased analytically or not .",
    "indeed , with all parameters but @xmath86 fixed in eq.([neutmass ] ) , and the knowledge of the mass of just one neutralino state ( say the lightest ) , it could well be that multiple branch solutions exist which would be lifted only through extra information about the couplings in this sector .",
    "it turns out , however , not to be the case ( at least when phases are ignored ) : there is basically a unique solution , apart from the fact that one should allow for negative and positive values for the input neutralino mass since @xmath21 can have negative eigenvalues .",
    "( this sign liberty is actually the only ambiguity which can be eventually fixed through the study of the couplings and will not be discussed further here . )",
    "+ the trick is to write down the four independent combinations of the entries of @xmath21 which are invariant under similarity transformations , and thus relate them simply to the four eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "one can then express the correlations between the eigenvalues and the basic parameters in the following form :    @xmath96    @xmath97    where @xmath98 and @xmath99 index any neutralino mass parameter .",
    "( the tilde denotes the fact that the mass parameters can be negative valued ) the nice thing about the above equations is that if any of the neutralino masses is taken as input ( say @xmath100 ) , then the other three are determined analytically through a simple cubic equation . a unique value for @xmath86",
    "is then determined from eq.([solm1 ] ) after plugging any of these solutions .",
    "eqs.([solm1 ] , [ condition2 ] ) express in a specially convenient way the various correlations among the four eigenvalues and the basic parameters .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the input set @xmath101 _ plus _ one neutralino mass is optimal for a fully analytical determination . in particular",
    "this is precisely the input set required in ref.[1 ] .",
    "we illustrate here the complementarity of the two approaches by taking the two sets of numbers ( a ) and ( b ) in eq.([numillust ] ) and a lightest neutralino @xmath102 , to reconstruct @xmath86 and the remaining neutralino masses from eqs.([solm1 ] , [ condition2 ] ) :    @xmath103   { } \\\\{}\\\\ ( a )           \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }    ( + ) ; \\ ; [ 30{\\rm gev } , \\ ;   59{\\rm gev } , \\ ; -107{\\rm gev } , \\ ; 122{\\rm gev } ] \\\\                    { } \\\\ { }    ( -);\\ ; [ -52{\\rm gev } , \\ ;   58{\\rm gev } , \\ ; -119{\\rm gev } , \\ ; 120{\\rm gev } ]            \\end{array}\\right . \\\\                    { } \\\\ { } ( b )          \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l }    ( + ) ; \\ ; [ 46{\\rm gev } , \\ ;   110{\\rm gev } , \\ ; -130{\\rm gev } , \\ ; 284{\\rm gev } ] \\\\                    { } \\\\ { }    ( -);\\ ; [ -25{\\rm gev } , \\ ;",
    "101{\\rm gev } , \\ ; -132{\\rm gev } , \\ ; 284{\\rm gev } ]                          \\end{array}\\right . \\label{numillust1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    here @xmath104 refer to the two possible signs of the @xmath105 lightest eigenmass input .",
    "the effect of this sign tends to be more important for @xmath86 than for the neutralino masses .",
    "of course a minus sign should be accompanied with the appropriate sign change in the feynman rules involving neutralinos ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a further study of the left and right form factors in the chargino decay system could then lift partially the four - fold ambiguity in eq.([numillust1 ] ) .",
    "lifting the remaining two - fold ambiguity will still necessitate further measurements from the ino sector .",
    "+ back to the @xmath87 strategy , we give in fig.3 an illustration of the sensitivity to a chargino mass , fixing the other two masses of chargino and neutralino .",
    "the behavior of the reconstructed @xmath106 turns out to be fairly simple , up to the two - fold ambiguity induced by @xmath3 in the chargino sector .",
    "a simple behavior shows as well for the remaining three neutralino masses ( see @xcite ) , when the input neutralino mass is varied .",
    "this behavior which is fully controlled analytically can be used to discuss the generic gross features of the spectrum even when one deviates from the present input strategy .",
    "for instance the sensitivity to @xmath1 turns out to be rather mild , and the effect of the sign change in the input neutralino mass tends to be negligible apart from well localized regions ( see ref.[2 ] for further illustrations , including a reconstruction of the parameters at the gut scale ) .",
    "+ in fig.4 we illustrate the @xmath88 strategy .",
    "the input set in this case requires a partial numerical algorithm since the output becomes controlled by high degree polynomials . however using eqs.([solm1 ] , [ condition2 ] ) in conjunction with the chargino sector relations allows an optimized iterative algorithm .",
    "fig.4 shows a rather intricate behavior of @xmath106 when one chargino and two neutralino masses are taken as input , a reflection of the above mentioned high degree polynomials , which nevertheless boils down ( at least in our numerical trials ) to at most a four - fold ambiguity .",
    "the regions of many - fold ambiguities or no ambiguity at all are separated by domains where the output parameters become complex valued ( the shaded areas ) .",
    "furthermore the singular behavior in some small regions is generically traced back to zeroing some parameters ( see ref.[2 ] for more details ) .",
    "in this talk we presented two possible theoretical strategies for the extraction of the ino sector parameters from physical observables .",
    "the first relied on the study of the production and decay of the lightest chargino in @xmath6 collisions , the second on the knowledge of some ino masses .",
    "we also illustrated a full reconstruction of the ino sector when the two complementary approaches are brought together .",
    "generally speaking , these approaches provide with efficient tools for the study of the ino sector . in the same time , they suggest the need in some cases for further experimental information due to the occurrence of possible discrete ambiguities in the reconstruction .",
    "+ furthermore , although we only considered real - valued parameters , some of the material presented here goes through unaltered if phases are allowed .",
    "this is the case in cddkz for the chargino sector , even though extra information will still be needed to determine those phases .",
    "the inclusion of phases is less obvious in km , especially in the neutralino sector , and deserves a separate study by itself .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that the above strategies can give indirect information about the need for phases , whenever the experimental data place the parameters in the forbidden regions delineated in km . in any case ,",
    "a by - product of the analytical study would have been the construction of fast and flexible algorithms which can be used in various ways when reconstructing the ino parameters .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the strategies we presented here are just at the theoretical level .",
    "obviously a more realistic examination of the experimental extraction of observables and related errors is still needed to assess their degree of efficiency .",
    "in addition , these strategies should eventually be placed in a wider context involving the other sectors of the mssm , taking into account plausible discovery scenarios of the susy partners .",
    "the inter - correlations between these sectors , endemic to supersymmetry , will then hopefully allow a unique determination of all the parameters of the model .",
