    "@xcite recently suggested that aperture - synthesis imaging and calibration artefacts may introduce strong non - gaussianities into the noise distribution for images of stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which will in turn affect the false detection rate of sources in linear polarization . to model these non - gaussianities in stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , they suggested use of a compound distribution comprising a gaussian distribution plus an exponential distribution ; this is known from the psychological literature as the ex - gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "while it is likely that imaging artefacts will be present in images of stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , their influence should be largely accounted for in _ local _ estimates of rms noise ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this process will ensure that the distribution of pixel snrs is well described by a gaussian , in turn ensuring that local detection thresholds can be computed accurately using the equations presented in this paper .    in an effort to explain the seemingly non - gaussian distribution exhibited in the lower panel of fig .  7 from @xcite ,",
    "in which stokes @xmath0 data from the nvss @xcite were presented , we focus on two effects .",
    "we note that @xcite did not evaluate false detection rates using the nvss data itself , but rather a simulated sky survey described as having characteristics similar to the nvss . here",
    "we examine whether the real nvss data can be used to justify claims of strong non - gaussian noise .",
    "the first consideration is the presence of real sources , which may be positive or negative in stokes @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) .",
    "such sources need to be masked prior to investigation of the noise distribution .",
    "@xcite masked real total intensity sources out of the stokes @xmath0 nvss data investigated .",
    "we attempted to recover a non - gaussian distribution using nvss data by investigating a sample of @xmath161 tiles selected to have central positions located along a line of constant declination with j2000 @xmath162 ; for simplicity we did not analyse the full 2326 tiles comprising the nvss .",
    "we selected 75 of the 90 tiles in this declination range , avoiding 15 tiles containing missing pointings in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "we supplemented this sample with an additional tile , c1232p12 , chosen arbitrarily to ensure that at least one tile containing pointings with significant amplitude calibration errors was included in our analysis .",

    "we also investigated a subset of 73 of these tiles following the removal of tile c1232p12 , as well as two other tiles , c0432p28 and c0448p28 , which were found to contain pointings with minor yet distinct calibration errors .",
    "the declination range above was selected to be representative of the nvss , comprising tiles positioned from the north galactic pole down to and below the galactic plane .",
    "tiles near the galactic plane are likely contain large - scale emission unresolved by the nvss , which may in turn plausibly introduce non - gaussianities into the data due to difficulties encountered during deconvolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to obtain stokes @xmath0 images as free from true sources as possible",
    ", we conservatively masked all pixels that had corresponding stokes @xmath163 intensities @xmath164  mjy  beam@xmath14 .",
    "the rms noise in the nvss is @xmath165  mjy  beam@xmath14 in stokes @xmath163 and @xmath166  mjy  beam@xmath14 in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we note that if masking were only applied to pixels corresponding to catalogued nvss sources , namely pixels with @xmath163  @xmath167  @xmath168 , then real stokes @xmath0 emission from sources with @xmath169 fractional polarization could remain unmasked with significance up to @xmath170 , biasing efforts to uncover the underlying noise distribution .",
    "we then compared histograms of stokes @xmath0 pixels intensities for the unmasked and masked data , and for the distribution observed by @xcite , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] .",
    "we found that the unmasked 76 tile data displayed non - gaussian wings above the nvss levels reported by @xcite , while the masked 76 tile data displayed wings that fell off more rapidly with intensity than their levels .",
    "the 73 tile data was found to exhibit significantly attenuated wings compared with the 76 tile data .",
    "the distribution described by @xcite is inconsistent with the 73 tile data .",
    "the difference between the unmasked and masked 76 tile data in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] is due to real sources , while the difference between the masked 76 and 73 tile data is due to the inclusion of tiles with significant imaging errors .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy between the nvss distribution observed by @xcite and the masked 73 tile nvss distribution examined in this work is likely to be due to residual unmasked sources , the inclusion of corrupted tiles , a combination of both , or some other processing error .    to explain why the masked 73 tile data exhibit small non - gaussian wings",
    ", we now consider a second effect that may also lead to spurious claims of non - gaussian noise .",
    "it is common for rms noise to vary spatially throughout an image due to imaging artefacts about strong sources , or intrinsic observational features such as primary beam sensitivity .",
    "if a histogram of pixel intensities is used as a proxy to examine the noise distribution within such an image , rather than a histogram of pixel snrs ( which require local rms noise estimates ) , then the inferred noise distribution will appear to follow a gaussian distribution with exponential wings . similarly ,",
    "if the distribution of pixel snrs is examined for these images whilst assuming that rms noise is spatially uniform , then the inferred noise distribution will again appear to follow the ex - gaussian distribution . in both these examples , no intrinsic non - gaussianities need exist .",
    "to demonstrate , consider the following illustrative scenario in which an image is arbitrarily divided into two spatial regions , each represented by gaussian statistics but with a different standard deviation .",
    "if 99.9% of the image has standard deviation 1 ( in arbitrary units ) and 0.1% has standard deviation 5 ( this is a crude representation of the fraction of 76 stokes @xmath0 tiles exhibiting calibration errors ) , then the observed distribution of all pixel intensities will follow an ex - gaussian distribution . despite this suggested appearance of non - gaussianity , the distribution of pixel snrs , obtained using local rms noise estimates , will exhibit purely gaussian characteristics .",
    "indeed , this simplified example further demonstrates that if an observed distribution of pixel snrs is not gaussian ( following masking of real sources ) , then the implemented local rms noise estimation procedure may not be performing suitably .    to construct distributions of pixel snrs for the unmasked and masked nvss data",
    "presented above , we used the rms estimation algorithm implemented within the sextractor package to generate a background rms noise map for each tile .",
    "we set the local mesh size to @xmath171  pixel@xmath172 , an area equivalent to @xmath173 independent resolution elements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our estimates of local rms noise therefore have uncertainty @xmath174^{{\\scriptscriptstyle}2}[1-n_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}b}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle}-1}]-1\\}^{{\\scriptscriptstyle}0.5}\\approx10\\%$ ] ( using an approximation to the uncertainty of the standard error estimator , suitable for @xmath175 ; see p.  63 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or greater if many resolution elements in a given mesh contain true sources .",
    "we then computed pixel snrs using the local rms noise values . for comparison",
    ", we also computed pixel snrs by assuming a spatially uniform rms noise value for all tiles .",
    "this value was obtained from a fit to the masked 73 tile pixel intensity data , as indicated by the solid curve in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] . the resulting snr histograms for the unmasked and masked nvss data",
    "are presented in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] .",
    "we found that the distributions constructed using the uniform noise level exhibited stronger non - gaussian wings than those constructed using local noise estimates ( the former are equivalent to the pixel intensity distributions presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] ) , indicating the presence of spatial variations in image sensitivity .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated by the masked 76 tile data ; the failure of this data to exhibit a pure gaussian distribution when using local noise estimates may be predominantly attributed to rapid changes in image sensitivity near corrupted pointings , where the accuracy of the rms noise estimation algorithm employed by sextractor is diminished .",
    "the snr distribution for the masked 73 tile data with local rms noise estimates ( blue dots ) was found to closely follow a gaussian distribution , modulo two apparently non - gaussian features .",
    "first , neglecting bins with @xmath176  @xmath167  @xmath177 , the distribution was found to broaden with snr against that of a true gaussian .",
    "this broadening is predominantly due to variance in the rms noise estimates used to calculate snrs , rather than any intrinsic features of the pixel intensity data .",
    "to demonstrate , we simulated a distribution of snrs by drawing samples from a gaussian with unit variance and dividing each sample by a noise term that was itself drawn from a gaussian with unit mean and standard deviation @xmath178 .",
    "the resulting distribution is displayed in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nvss ] , providing a close fit to the observed data .",
    "second , the distribution was found to exhibit 18 pixels with @xmath179 .",
    "we examined the nvss image data to determine the origin of these discrepant pixels .",
    "we found that 5 of these pixels were situated one pixel beyond the masking boundary of a strong total intensity source , where the total intensity emission was observed to drop suddenly to become negative due an adjacent noise trough or possibly a cleaning artefact .",
    "these stokes @xmath0 pixels were thus associated with unmasked real emission .",
    "the remaining 13 pixels were situated within pointings exhibiting image striping , consistent with calibration errors ; additionally , each of these pointings were situated close the galactic plane , with galactic longitude @xmath180 and latitude @xmath181 . given these identifications ,",
    "we conclude that there is no significant evidence for non - gaussian noise in the stokes @xmath0 nvss data once pointings exhibiting easily discerned calibration errors have been removed . while we can not rule out the presence of non - gaussian noise in all surveys , the lack of evidence for such noise in the nvss sample analysed here suggests that surveys with more sophisticated data reduction are unlikely to be affected , and almost certainly not at the strong levels suggested by @xcite .",
    "we have derived customised statistics to describe faraday - space measurements of linearly polarized intensity obtained using rm synthesis .",
    "the equations presented enable objective determination of the significance of polarization detections , which will be useful for upcoming surveys of radio polarization .",
    "we found that when the observation - specific parameter @xmath55 was increased , larger detection thresholds were required for @xmath13 to ensure that noise features were not mistaken for real polarized emission ( e.g. see middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : statsall ] ) .",
    "we found this effect to be exponential ; @xmath55 needed to be increased by at least an order of magnitude ( e.g. from 10 to 100 , or 1,000 to 10,000 ) before the new detection threshold required to satisfy an original level of statistical significance needed to be significantly raised .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is of limited practical use to tailor observational setups to minimise @xmath55 , unless @xmath55 can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude . a suitable strategy for large-@xmath55 observations , such as those afforded by the @xmath182 capabilities of facilities such as the australia telescope compact array and",
    "expanded very large array , may be to first perform rm - synthesis using reduced spectral resolution ( i.e. by averaging spectral channels to reduce @xmath75 , and in turn @xmath55 ) in order to identify faint polarized emission over a reduced @xmath58 range .",
    "we also discussed source extraction in polarization images and the importance of obtaining spatially - dependent rms noise estimates .",
    "we have not discussed the derivation of confidence intervals for polarization measurements , the setting of upper limits , or polarization bias . while detailed inspection of these issues remains beyond the scope of this work , we close by briefly highlighting how our results may be used in the future to address each of them , as follows .",
    "using the equations developed in this work , credible intervals ( the bayesian equivalent of frequentist confidence intervals ) may be constructed using the technique presented by @xcite .",
    "similarly , confidence bounds ( which depend on observed intensities ) and upper limits ( which do not depend on observed intensities , but rather on the detection process and type ii error minimisation ) may be evaluated using the techniques presented by @xcite ; a demonstration using observational data will be presented by hales et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    finally , we note that the different statistics exhibited by @xmath8 and @xmath13 prevent the application of polarization debiasing schemes designed for the former from being applied to the latter .",
    "however , exceptions may be suitable in the limit to polarized sources strong enough to display a similar pdf in both @xmath13 and @xmath8 ( e.g. compare curves in the lower and upper panels of fig  [ fig : statsall ] ) .",
    "in general , a polarization bias correction scheme designed for @xmath13 would need to be parameterised by a term such as @xmath55 from equation  ( [ eqn : mdef ] ) , so as to take into account the experiment - specific terms @xmath63 and @xmath68 .",
    "we note that the fixed , un - parameterised debiasing schemes presented by @xcite and @xcite are therefore limited in applicable experimental scope .",
    "future investigations are clearly required to resolved these issues . instead of attempting to correct observed flux densities for polarization bias alone , an alternate approach may be to combine this correction with one for @xcite bias , which like polarization bias is always present",

    "given that @xmath31 may be encountered in observational data , as highlighted in the examples below , in this appendix we investigate how @xmath24 may be defined such that the analytic equations presented in this work for @xmath8 and @xmath13 may remain _ approximately _ valid . while it is not possible to fully model a bivariate normal distribution with a single noise term @xmath24 when @xmath31 , we note that the only region of pdf parameter space that needs to be accurately modelled is that of the noise outlier population ( i.e. @xmath167@xmath184 ) ; in practice , detection thresholds may be suitably defined using this population , such that accurate modelling of the remaining parameter space is not required .",
    "we therefore focus here on obtaining a rudimentary definition for @xmath24 that , under certain conditions , may facilitate use of the analytic relationships presented in this work .",
    "two examples of data exhibiting @xmath31 are as follows .",
    "first , consider images of stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 in which a polarized source is present with signal @xmath185 , as will be the case in general .",
    "following deconvolution , it is possible for residual sidelobes and other artefacts about strong sources to affect one image more than the other , causing some lines - of - sight to exhibit @xmath31 . as a second example , spatial variations in root - mean - square ( rms )",
    "noise may be present and independently - positioned throughout images of stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where beam - sized noise elements are superposed on larger - scale undulations .",
    "for example , undulations in rms noise may be produced in aperture synthesis images by large scale emission that is unrecoverable by deconvolution algorithms such as clean @xcite , or in general radio imaging through insufficient flagging of data affected by radio frequency interference .",
    "even surveys designed to exhibit spatially uniform rms noise , such as the nvss @xcite , exhibit undulations in rms noise due to a combination of the effects described above , thus enabling some lines of sight to exhibit @xmath31 . though the issues above may be mitigated by telescope design , observing strategy , and data processing , the potential remains for lines - of - sight to exhibit @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , and in a trivial sense , uncertainties in the estimator used to evaluate @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( using hat notation here to indicate standard errors rather than true underlying standard deviations ) will result in @xmath188 and @xmath189 , such that @xmath190 may result in situations where @xmath191 .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn : sigdef ] ) indicates that a suitable first - order form for @xmath24 may be defined by @xmath200 with positive factors @xmath201 and @xmath202 satisfying @xmath203 , and where these factors may be assumed to be constants ( i.e. independent of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) to ensure that @xmath24 remains signal - independent ( note comments at the end of   [ sec : standard ] ) . to investigate whether the use of equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) , or the average standard error definition further above , could enable outliers within empirically - obtained @xmath31 distributions to be suitably characterised by the analytic distributions for @xmath8 and @xmath13 , we performed the following simulations .",
    "we populated discrete distributions of @xmath43 ( dimensionless ) for @xmath204 and examined how closely outliers beyond @xmath205 were fit by equation  ( [ eqn : ray ] ) .",
    "three definitions for @xmath24 were tested : @xmath195 , equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) with @xmath206 , and a case where @xmath201 and @xmath202 were varied in search of optimal values .",
    "we set up our simulations in two ways . in the first setup",
    ", we assumed that the variance in standard error estimates was zero , namely that @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "we found that selecting @xmath209 or @xmath210 over- or underestimated the noise required to correctly model true outlier populations , respectively . selecting these values in turn under- or overestimated the true statistical significance of outliers , respectively .",
    "we therefore note that if we conservatively defined @xmath211 , then the statistical significance of outliers , as well as that of true polarized sources , would never be overestimated ( though they would certainly be underestimated ) . to limit the degree to which the significance of polarization detections ( both signal and noise ) could be underestimated , whilst still generally preventing them from being overestimated , we found the following empirical values to be suitable for use in equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) : @xmath212 with @xmath213 .",
    "we found that use of these factors limited systematic underestimation of the statistical significance of @xmath214 outlier samples to @xmath215  2% of their true , empirically determined values ; this underestimation peaked at @xmath216 , diminishing elsewhere within the @xmath204 range tested .",
    "for comparison , we found that the conservative definition @xmath211 performed worse , typically underestimating true significance values systematically by @xmath217 . in the second simulation setup",
    ", we investigated the effects of uncertainties in @xmath186 and @xmath187 by assuming what we envisaged to be @xmath218worst - case 10% errors in each . the factors from equation  ( [ eqn : afactors ] ) were again found to be suitable in these simulations .",
    "we found that introducing variance into the standard error estimates affected the empirical @xmath8 distributions in a manner similar to the influence of introducing @xmath31 , shifting outlier populations away from the analytic pdfs .",
    "we found that the @xmath195 and @xmath206 definitions for @xmath24 resulted in empirical distributions that were closely fit by equation  ( [ eqn : ray ] ) at low - snrs , but which resulted in increasingly poor fits for outlier populations as either variance was introduced to the standard error estimates or @xmath31 was introduced .",
    "the @xmath206 definition resulted in marginally improved fits for noise outliers compared with the average standard error definition .",
    "the third definition , using equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) with factors from equation  ( [ eqn : afactors ] ) , resulted in empirical distributions most accurately fit by equation  ( [ eqn : ray ] ) for outliers , though at the expense of poor fitting at low - snr .",
    "we found that this definition of @xmath24 optimally accounted for unequal noise within the range tested , even when variance in standard error estimates was introduced ( though less so towards the upper end of the range where @xmath221 ) .",
    "we performed similar simulations for @xmath13 to investigate suitability of the @xmath24 definitions considered above in this different statistical environment .",
    "we simplified the potential complexity of these simulations by assuming the following illustrative @xmath218worst - case setup based on the @xmath125 , 24 spectral channel setup described in ",
    "[ sec : rmstats ] .",
    "individual samples of @xmath13 were obtained empirically by selecting the maximum of @xmath125 independent rayleigh - distributed variates .",
    "each of these variates was assumed to represent a uniformly - weighted stack of 24 spectral channels , namely with equation  ( [ eqn : rmweights ] ) set to unity .",
    "we investigated unequal noise by systematically assuming @xmath136 , @xmath222 , or @xmath223 for each @xmath62th channel , and investigated the influence of uncertainties in estimates of standard error by introducing 10% error to @xmath224 and @xmath225 for each channel ( thus @xmath226% in each of the @xmath227 stacked @xmath0 and @xmath1 values used to obtain each sample of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we found similar behaviour of the different @xmath24 definitions to that exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : nesigqul ] .",
    "however , the effect of introducing unequal noise was found to be more prominent within outlier populations in fig .",
    "[ fig : nesigqulrm ] due to their being selected from a maximum of @xmath125 samples .",
    "this effect will be further pronounced for data with larger @xmath55 , though because it is unlikely that all spectral channels will exhibit the systematic unequal noise assumed in our worst - case simulations , the outlier populations in real data are unlikely to be as extreme as those presented here .",
    "additionally , if channel weighting is introduced according to equation  ( [ eqn : rmweights ] ) , the the impacts of bad channel data will be minimised and outlier populations further reduced .",
    "regarding the introduction of variance in @xmath224 and @xmath225 , we note that its impact on outlier populations will be minimised for data with a greater number of spectral channels , due to the @xmath228 dependence in stacked channel data . as with the simulations for @xmath8",
    ", we found that by defining @xmath24 using equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) with the factors from equation  ( [ eqn : afactors ] ) , outlier populations of the various empirical distributions investigated were aligned robustly with the analytic distribution given by equation  ( [ eqn : orderray ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the analytic equations presented in the main body of this paper may be utilised for data exhibiting modest unequal noise of @xmath194 , without incurring significant biases , by defining @xmath24 according to equation  ( [ eqn : lsig ] ) with factors from equation  ( [ eqn : afactors ] ) .",
    "while our simulations have indicated that this definition may be suitable for data exhibiting more extreme unequal noise , we caution that we have not considered the potential impacts of biases on polarization position angles ; future investigation regarding this issue is clearly required ."
