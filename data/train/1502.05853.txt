    "a classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway leading to the explosive ejection of the envelope accreted onto a white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system in which the companion is either filling or nearly filling its roche surface @xcite .",
    "they are a type of cataclysmic variables , i.e. optically variable binary systems with a mass transfer from a companion star to wd .",
    "novae are typically detected first in optical observations when the brightness of the object increases by 7 - 16 magnitudes .",
    "the energy spectra of novae often contain a thermal x - ray continuum .",
    "the symbiotic novae , like the classical novae , are also initiated by a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the wd .",
    "however in the case of symbiotic novae , the wd is deep immersed in the wind of a late - type companion star ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration at the blast wave of symbiotic novae was expected to accelerate particles up to energies of a few tevs @xcite . in 2010",
    "the first gev gamma - ray emission was detected by the _",
    "fermi_-lat  from the symbiotic nova v407 cyg @xcite .",
    "such gamma - ray emission can be explained in terms of either leptonic or hadronic models @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the local radiation fields create a target for the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the electrons . on the other hand , protons accelerated in the same conditions",
    "can interact with the matter producing gamma - rays via proton - proton interactions .",
    "several models have been put forward to explain the gev radiation .",
    "for instance , the gev gamma - ray emission can be attributed to the ic process on the strong radiation field of the red giant @xcite .",
    "the same model predicts a second component in the tev range due to proton - proton interactions with the wind of the red giant .",
    "also @xcite consider acceleration of leptons and hadrons in the nova shock . in that model the magnetic field , which determines the acceleration efficiency , is obtained assuming an equipartition with the thermal energy density upstream of the shock .",
    "the gev @xmath0-ray emission is then a product of ic scattering of the nova light by the electrons .    in the last few years",
    "fermi_-lat  has discovered gev gamma - ray emission from a few more novae : v1324 sco , v959 mon , v339 del , and v1369 cen @xcite .",
    "most of these sources are classical novae .",
    "contrary to the symbiotic ones , they do not exhibit a strong wind of the companion star .",
    "interestingly , symbiotic and classical novae all exhibit similar spectral properties of the gev emission . in classical novae",
    "the particles acceleration can occur e.g. on a bow shock between the nova ejecta and the interstellar medium or in weaker internal shocks due to inhomogenuity of the nova ejecta @xcite .",
    "in particular orbital motion of the system can lead to shaping the nova ejecta into a combination of a faster polar wind of the wd ejecta , and a denser material drifted along the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "so far no very - high - energy ( vhe ; e@xmath1100 gev ) gamma - ray emission has been detected from any nova event .",
    "veritas observations of v407 cyg which started 10 days after the nova explosion yielded a differential upper limit on the flux at 1.6 tev of @xmath2@xcite    beginning in fall 2012 the magic telescopes conducted a nova follow - up program in order to detect a possible vhe gamma - ray component .",
    "the program was first aimed on symbiotic novae .",
    "after the reports of detection of gev emission from classical novae by the _",
    "fermi_-lat , the program was extended also to bright classical novae and opened up to additional outbursts from cataclysmic variables .",
