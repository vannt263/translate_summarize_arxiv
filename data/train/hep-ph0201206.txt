    "gluon fusion will be the most important production channel for higgs discovery at the lhc . the higgs boson should manifest itself in the reaction @xmath2 , where a signal should emerge on top of a very smooth , measurable @xmath3 background . at the tevatron ,",
    "the focus for higgs discovery is in associated production modes like @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in a mass window around the @xmath6 threshold , however , gluon fusion is important .",
    "nnlo corrections to the process @xmath7 have been evaluated recently in the heavy top limit and the approximation of soft gluon radiation @xcite , where the partonic center - of - mass energy is close to the higgs mass , @xmath8 . if we write the partonic cross section as an expansion in @xmath9 , it has the following form : @xmath10_+ \\\\    & \\quad+ \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\sum_{k=0}^{2n-1 }    c_{lk}^{(n)}\\ , ( 1-x)^l\\ln^k(1-x)\\ , , \\label{eq::abc } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the @xmath11_+$ ] terms are `` @xmath12''-distributions defined in the usual way ( see , e.g.ref.@xcite ) .",
    "refs.@xcite contain the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 up to @xmath15 of this expansion .",
    "however , as anticipated in ref.@xcite , these contributions are not sufficient to arrive at a reliable prediction for the total cross section .",
    "using resummation techniques , the authors of ref.@xcite evaluated the coefficient @xmath16 at nnlo .",
    "it was included in the final results of refs.@xcite.however , the unknown sub - leading terms @xmath17 with @xmath18 , were treated in different ways by refs.@xcite and @xcite , leading to significant deviations in the numerical results .",
    "it is the purpose of the current letter to report on the analytical evaluation of the coefficients @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in other words , we compute the partonic cross section for higgs production in terms of an expansion around the soft limit .",
    "we find that the series converges very well and conclude that our final results are equivalent to a calculation of the cross section in closed analytic form .",
    "we therefore resolve the ambiguities of refs.@xcite and provide a realistic prediction for the higgs production cross section in @xmath0 and @xmath22 collisions .",
    "in checking our methods , we found an error in thennlo drell - yan calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "the correct result is given at the end of the next section .",
    "in the following we will assume all quark masses to vanish , except for the top quark mass , and neglect all electro - weak couplings . in this limit",
    ", the higgs boson can couple to gluons only via a top quark loop .",
    "this coupling can be approximated by an effective lagrangian corresponding to the limit @xmath23 , which is valid for a large range of @xmath24 , including the currently favored region between 100 and 200  gev .",
    "the effective lagrangian is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath27 is the higgs field , @xmath28gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and @xmath29 is the wilson coefficient .",
    "renormalization of this lagrangian has been discussed in ref.@xcite , for example , and shall not be repeated here . in the @xmath30 scheme , the coefficient function @xmath29 reads , up to the order required here [ @xcite , @xcite ] : @xmath31 + \\ldots\\bigg\\}\\ , , \\label{eq::c1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 .",

    "the feynman diagrams to be evaluated for hadronic collisions at nnlo are : ( i )  two - loop virtual diagrams for @xmath7 ; ( ii )  one - loop single real emission diagrams for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ; ( iii )  tree - level double real emission diagrams for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eq.([eq::abc ] ) are determined by the @xmath49 sub - process only , while the @xmath19 receive contributions from all sub - processes .    for the single real emission diagrams ( ii ) ,",
    "the full analytical result for general values of @xmath50 has been evaluated and will be published elsewhere .",
    "it can be expanded trivially in terms of @xmath9 . in order to obtain this expansion for the double real emission contribution ( iii ) , we evaluated the squared amplitude and expressed the invariants of incoming and outgoing momenta , as well as the phase space measure in terms of two scattering angles and the dimensionless variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , defined by  @xcite @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the momenta of the incoming partonsand the ( outgoing ) higgs boson , respectively .",
    "modulo powers that vanish as @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the space - time dimension ) , the resulting expression is expanded as a laurent series in @xmath9 .",
    "the leading terms in this expansion are of order @xmath59 and give rise to the purely soft contribution obtained in refs.@xcite . here",
    "we also keep higher orders in this expansion , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . aside from a few extra algebraic manipulations of hypergeometric functions , this expansion procedure allows us to performthe phase space integration along the lines of ref.@xcite .",
    "details of the calculations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "there are a number of checks that can be performed on our result .",
    "one is to see that all poles in @xmath62 cancel .",
    "we have explicitly verified this cancellation through order@xmath63 .",
    "since we have computed single real emission and the mass factorization counterterms in closed form(as opposed to an expansion in @xmath9 ) , we can also obtain the pole terms for double real emission in closed form by _ demanding _ that the poles cancel .",
    "this allows us to obtain in closed form all finite terms in the cross section that are linked to the poles .",
    "these include all terms proportional to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and all explicitly scale - dependent terms .    as another check on our approach we applied it to the cross section for the drell - yan process at nnlo , where the full @xmath50-dependence is known in analytical form  @xcite .",
    "detailed comparison with unpublished intermediate results   shows that our expansion of the tree - level double real emission terms is in complete agreement with the corresponding expansion of the exact calculation.however , we find differences in the one - loop single real emission terms which we also have computed exactly .",
    "we conclude that the nnlo result for the drell - yan process in ref.@xcite is incorrect and that the correct result is @xmath66 the numerical effect of these corrections is rather small and shall be investigated in more detail elsewhere .",
    "we now present the result for the partonic higgs production cross sections at nnlo .",

    "it has been argued  @xcite that convergence is improved by pulling out a factor of @xmath50 from @xmath79 before expanding in @xmath9 .",
    "we indeed observe a more stable behavior at low orders of @xmath9 and will adoptthis prescription in what follows . beyond fifth order ,",
