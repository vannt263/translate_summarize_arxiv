    "interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds are likely , as the short lifetime of massive stars mean that they do not move far from the molecular cloud in which they form .",
    "once the star goes supernova the expanding remnant shocks the molecular cloud , heating and compressing it and changing the chemical composition of the gas .",
    "these shock waves contribute to the disruption of the cloud and may also trigger star formation .",
    "signatures such as kinematics and disturbed morphology have been used as the primary evidence of such interactions , but the interpretation was inconclusive due to confusion of the projection along the line of sight .",
    "the mixed - morphology class of supernova remnants is also believed to be an indicator of interaction with a molecular cloud .",
    "mixed - morphology remnants appear center - filled in x - rays and shell - like at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the supernova shock propagating into dense and possibly clumpy interstellar gas is believed to be responsible for the interstellar gas in the interior of the remnant , either through the evaporation of clumps overrun by the supernova shock @xcite or heat conduction reducing the internal temperature and density gradients @xcite .",
    "the discovery of 1720  mhz oh masers in supernova remnants , created in the shocked region , hence provided a solid diagnostic of the interaction .",
    "produced by a transition within the ground rotational state of oh , 1720  mhz oh line emission towards supernova remnants was first detected in w28 and w44 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented high - resolution images of w28 that showed a more extensive distribution of 1720  mhz emission than was expected and were the first to suggest that the 1720  mhz oh maser line may be a powerful diagnostic of the interaction of supernova remnants with molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite showed that collisions of oh molecules with h@xmath4 molecules with kinetic temperatures @xmath5 below 200  k strongly inverted the 1720  mhz line .",
    "densities between 10@xmath6 and 10@xmath7 @xmath8 and temperatures between 50 and 125 k are needed for the inversion to function efficiently .",

    "* ) . at lower column densities",
    "the opacity is too small and at higher column densities radiative trapping thermalises the transition .",
    "surveys of @xmath2200 galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) , have found that 1 in 10 have 1720  mhz emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the masers allow the kinetic distance to the snr to be estimated as their velocities are close to the line - of - sight velocity of the unshocked cloud complex and are consistent with other measures of the systemic velocity of the remnant .",
    "zeeman observations allow the line - of - sight magnetic field of the maser to be measured , from which the internal pressure of the supernova remnant can be calculated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , not all supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds will have 1720  mhz masers , as the conditions may not be correct to produce 1720  mhz masers or the masers could be beamed away from the line of sight @xcite .",
    "so another definitive signature of the interaction would be useful .",
    "masers resulting from a second maser transition would allow constraints to be placed on physical conditions , such as density and temperature in the masing region , particularly if the maser was spatially coincident with an observed 1720  mhz maser .",
    "it would also confirm the zeeman interpretation of the splitting seen between the left- and right - hand circular polarisations ( lhcp , rhcp ) at 1720  mhz , as circular polarisation can be produced by non - zeeman mechanisms ( elitzur 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the 6049  mhz line in the first excited rotational level of oh is an analogue of the 1720  mhz satellite line .",
    "oh excitation calculations @xcite suggest that the 6049  mhz satellite line may be present at higher oh column densities where the 1720  mhz line is weak or absent , and therefore might be a complementary signature of the interaction of supernova remnants and molecular clouds .",
    "the 4765  mhz oh line in the second excited rotational state peaks at an even higher column density of @xmath11  @xmath1 .",
    "this column density is higher than that expected in the interaction of supernova remnants and molecular clouds .",
    "this motivated us to conduct searches for 6049  mhz oh maser emission using parkes , atca , and exploratory time on the evla ( atca and evla to be reported in another paper ) .",

    "no 6049  mhz maser emission was detected , however several 6030 and 6035  mhz oh masers associated with star - forming regions were found .",
    "it is not surprising that some star - forming regions were unintentionally included in the observed fields as star - formation can be triggered by supernovae .",
    "@xcite also observed pointings towards 14 supernova remnants at 6049  mhz but did not detect any oh emission .",

    "scans were conducted over either 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 or 1.0 degree areas to completely cover the area of the remnant .",

    "the calibrator was observed twice , but it was raining heavily during one of the observations so only one of the calibrator scans was used .",
    "the weather was cloudy or raining during all the observations and this adds to the uncertainty in the flux calibration .",
    "thirty - five supernova remnants , a star - forming region and four fields in the large and small magellanic clouds were observed ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the remnants were chosen such that the majority were known or thought to be interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "the star - forming region has a known 6035  mhz oh maser and was observed to confirm that the system was working .",

    "however , as it is predicted that 1720  mhz oh masers are unlikely to be produced when the column density is high enough to produce 6049  mhz oh masers , half of the supernova remnants that were observed have no 1720  mhz masers , but other signatures indicating an interaction with a molecular cloud .",
    "eleven of the remnants surveyed are a part of the mixed - morphology class of supernova remnants with an additional nine possibly being members of this class @xcite .",
    "other signatures suggestive of an interaction with a molecular cloud such as tev @xmath27-ray emission @xcite , infrared emission suggesting molecular shocks ( e.g. @xcite ) , or the presence of shocked co or nearby co clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , were used to identify prospective galactic supernova remnants .",
    "two fields in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) were observed when no galactic supernova remnants were above the telescope horizon .",
    "the fields were chosen to contain as many supernova remnants as possible - nine in the first field and eight in the second .    the data were flux - calibrated , continuum subtracted and gridded using the programs livedata and gridzilla @xcite .",
    "livedata is a program specifically designed for data taken with the parkes multibeam receiver .",
    "it removes the bandpass , calibrates the spectra , applies doppler tracking , and smoothes and removes the baselines of the spectrum .",
    "the bandpass calibration uses robust statistical estimators , such as median estimators , which can reject radio frequency interference without human intervention and is tailored to identify compact emission regions .",
    "gridzilla converts the individual spectra produced by livedata into position - position - velocity cubes by placing the spectra on a regular grid .",
    "the gridding process determines which spectra will contribute to an individual pixel , rejects those spectra which appear to contain corrupt data and ascribes a statistical weight to each remaining spectrum . the value of the pixel is then calculated based on the input data and weights . as with livedata ,",
    "the gridding process is optimised for point sources and uses the median statistic to produce more robust results .",
    "a scale of 1 arcmin per pixel was used .",
    "the data cubes were first searched for any obvious maser emission by eye and then searched using the program duchamp .",
    "duchamp is designed to search for small , isolated objects within spectral - line data cubes .",
    "the program searches for connected voxels that are above some flux threshold , with user - defined limits on size and no assumption made as to the shape of the detections .",
    "the cube can be reconstructed using the _  trous _ wavelet procedure , which effectively reduces much of the noise in the image , thereby allowing the cube to be searched to fainter levels while reducing the number of spurious detections .",
    "the reconstruction is conducted by discretely convolving the input array with a b@xmath28-spline filter function , determining wavelet coefficients by calculating the difference between the convolved array and the input array and if these coefficients are above the requested threshold at a given point , they are added to the reconstructed array .",
    "the separation between the filter coefficients is then doubled and the first step is performed again with the convolved array as the input array .",
    "this process is continued until the maximum number of scales required is reached and then the final smoothed array is added to the reconstructed array to provide the ` dc offset ' .",
    "the 2-dimensional raster - scanning algorithm of @xcite is used to search the cube for detections , one channel map at a time .",
    "the middle of the noise distribution and the width of the distribution is used in calculating the threshold .",
    "the threshold is determined using the false discovery rate technique @xcite .",
    "this is given by the number of false detections divided by the total number of detections and is set by the user .",
    "in practice , the final list of detected objects that are false positives will be much smaller than that requested by the user as , due to merging and rejection of the individual pixels , there is not a direct connection between this value and the fraction of detections that will be false positives .",
    "the repeated detections in the list produced are then combined in an algorithm that matches objects judged to be ` close ' .",
    "the threshold distances apart for two objects to be merged spatially and in the velocity axis are set by the user .",
    "the spatial requirement can be set such that there must be a pair of pixels that are adjacent .",
    "once the detections are merged , they can be grown to some secondary threshold and then are sent through the merging algorithm again . to be accepted as detections",

    "oh masers are usually the strongest oh transition in star - forming regions , but weaker masers at other oh transitions , such as 6030 and 6035 mhz are also often detected .",
    "models of masers in star - forming regions predict these transitions .",
    "for example , @xcite and found that bright 6035  mhz masers are formed in warm dense regions where collisions play an important role in creating the inversion .",
    "the multiple maser spots at each site arise in the dusty molecular envelope around a massive star in its early stages of formation .",
    "the maser spots are valuable probes that can reveal the physical parameters of the environment where the massive star is forming , at a stage before it has been disrupted by the embedded star , and before the visible light can emerge through the dust .",
    "the maser phase occurs at the same time as the development of an ultracompact h  region around the star , but fade rapidly when the h  region has expanded to a size greater than @xmath37  au @xcite .",
    "@xcite have conducted a survey for 6035  mhz oh and 6668  mhz methanol masers in the magellanic clouds . with a 3-@xmath36 limit of 0.39  jy",
    ", they did not detect any 6035  mhz masers in the smc , which is in agreement with our lack of detections for the two fields in the smc .",
    "no oh 6049  mhz maser emission was detected in the current work above our 3-@xmath36 levels , which range from 0.3 to 0.6  jy / beam .",
    "therefore , a constraint can be placed upon the line - of - sight column density of the oh in supernova remnants . assuming a spatially uniform background continuum filling the beam plus a compact foreground oh masing column , filling a fraction of the beam , the observed intensity of a particular line can be written as    @xmath38\\}\\ , , \\label{eqn : intensity}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the background continuum intensity , @xmath40 is the planck function , @xmath41 is the optical depth , @xmath42 is the filling factor , and @xmath43 is the excitation temperature for the line . assuming that @xmath44  k and the rayleigh - jeans approximation holds , equation ( [ eqn : intensity ] )",
    "can be rewritten as    @xmath45    @xmath46 is the brightness temperature of the maser line detected by the telescope . fixing the h@xmath4 density at 10@xmath7  @xmath8 , a typical value determined for 1720 mhz oh maser - emitting regions @xcite , and using the model described in section [ sec : motivation ] , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 can be computed for a particular @xmath47 . for @xmath48  @xmath1 , @xmath49  k , which is much less than the continuum brightness temperatures typically found in supernova remnants ( @xmath220  k , e.g. g349.7 + 0.2 , @xcite ) .    therefore , assuming that @xmath43 is small , equation ( [ eqn : temp ] ) can be approximated by    @xmath50    as no 6049  mhz masers were detected , @xmath46 is the observed 3-@xmath36 brightness temperature limit for the fields , which varies from @xmath51 to 0.6  k ( @xmath52  k ) .",
    "therefore it can be seen that the limits on the optical depth depend on the values for the filling factor and the background continuum .",
    "@xcite found that a typical filling factor for the 1720  mhz oh masers observed with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) was 0.005 .",
    "as our beamsize is 3.4  arcmin compared to the 7.2  arcmin of the gbt , the typical filling factor is multiplied by four to give an appropriate value of 0.02 .",
    "assuming the stated continuum brightness temperature above of 20  k , it can be seen that    @xmath53    and therefore @xmath54 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] , this indicates a maximum oh column density of @xmath55  @xmath1 at 6049  mhz .    by way of example , consider the supernova remnant g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "for this remnant , no 6049  mhz masers were detected to a 3-@xmath36 level of 0.5  k. assuming the filling factor of 0.02 and background continuum brightness temperature of 20  k from above , the predicted brightness temperature for a 6049  mhz maser versus the column density is given in fig . [",
    "fig : modellingresults ] .",
    "the minimum observed brightness temperature of 0.5  k is also plotted , and the intersection of this line with the predicted brightness temperature provides a limit on the column density of the oh , consistent with the estimate from above .",
    "it can be seen that changing the filling factor and the continuum brightness temperature does not make much difference to the limit on @xmath41 , and hence on the oh column density .",
    "if the column density in the supernova remnant was above 10@xmath56  @xmath57 , 6049 mhz maser emission should have been detected .",
    "one possible interpretation of this limit , therefore , is that the column density must be below 10@xmath56  @xmath57 for this remnant .",
    "however , this conflicts with results obtained by @xcite who reported a column density of 10@xmath10  @xmath1 for areas in this remnant .    assuming all other parameters are static ,",
    "if the filling factor is an order of magnitude smaller than in the above calculations , the limit on the column density is @xmath58  @xmath1 and if it is an order of magnitude larger , the limit is @xmath59  @xmath1 .",
    "the 3-@xmath36 rms brightness temperature varies from 0.27  k to 0.59  k over the fields observed , which gives column densities ranging between @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xmath1 .",
    "changes in this parameter are therefore not significant for the fields observed .",
    "changing the temperature @xmath5 of the gas does not appear to significantly alter the results , as an increase to 75  k , as estimated by the modelling of @xcite , lowers the column density limit only slightly to @xmath62 .",
    "we now consider the range of filling factors inferred from the 1720  mhz observations by @xcite .",
    "the minimum filling factor , @xmath63 , was obtained for clumps e , f in w28 , with @xmath64 for a kinetic temperature of 75  k. the corresponding factor for the parkes beam is @xmath65 , and for @xmath66  k , our column density limit was @xmath67 .",
    "increasing @xmath68 reduces the limit , whereas , even at @xmath69  k , the limit on @xmath47 is still below the column density predicted by @xcite . at the other extreme ,",
    "the maximum filling factor , @xmath70 , is for clumps d , e , f in w44 , giving a predicted @xmath71 for a kinetic temperature of 50  k. for our beam , @xmath72 , and for @xmath66  k , our column density limit was @xmath73 .",
    "as above , increasing @xmath68 reduces the limit .",
    "if @xmath74  k , the column density limit is still below the column density predicted by @xcite , but if it is reduced further to @xmath75  k , the column density limit is above the predicted column density value .",
    "therefore , for almost all cases , the sensitivity of the observations was sufficient to detect 6049  mhz oh maser emission that theoretically should have been produced .",
    "this indicates that , assuming that the column densities estimated by @xcite are correct , 6049  mhz oh maser emission should have been observable in at least several of the remnants .",
    "several explanations may account for this conflict : the filling factor may be much smaller than estimated because the background continuum temperature is much higher , the continuum level could vary significantly over the beam , or there may be some other mechanism that is disrupting the formation of the masers , such as a too high velocity gradient in the oh column . however , as 1720  mhz oh masers are produced in some of these remnants and the excitation modelling does correctly predict the column density ranges expected for the amplification of 1720  mhz oh masers , any mechanism that stops the formation of the 6049  mhz oh masers can not affect the production of 1720  mhz oh masers .",
    "previous modelling by @xcite and @xcite only includes the thermal fwhm of the 1720  mhz and 6049  mhz oh lines ,    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath5 is the kinetic temperature and @xmath78 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . for @xmath15",
    "k , this is 0.37  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "if we allow non - thermal broadening , as expected in clouds , for @xmath79  @xmath80 and @xmath15  k at an oh column density of @xmath12  @xmath1 , the 6049  mhz inversion disappears at a fwhm linewidth of 0.54  km  s@xmath24 , whereas 1720  mhz is no longer produced at 0.70  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "therefore an increased sensitivity to velocity coherence may provide a partial explanation as to why 6049  mhz oh masers were not seen and yet 1720  mhz oh masers were seen in some remnants .",
    "however , the observed line widths of 1720  mhz oh masers are generally wider than predicted by any of the current models .",
    "note , however , that the oh column density expected in snr  cloud interactions is uncertain .",
    "existing models of oh production rely on uv or x - ray dissociation of the water produced in molecular shocks , and yield column densities @xmath81 @xcite . as the dissociation rate of",
    "oh is approximately half that of h@xmath4o , these models predict oh / h@xmath82 , and typically much less .",
    "this conflicts with recent absorption measurements in ic 443 , which find that @xmath83 @xcite and @xmath84 @xcite .     for t=50  k for the 6049 mhz line of oh , assuming a filling factor of 0.02 ( see text ) . the background continuum was assumed to have a brightness temperature of 20  k. the horizontal dotted line marks the 3-@xmath36 rms limit of our observations.,width=317 ]",
    "oh excitation calculations show that for column densities in excess of 10@xmath10  @xmath1 , maser emission at 6049  mhz may take over the role of 1720  mhz masers in indicating a snr    molecular cloud interaction .",
    "the oh column density typically produced in these interactions is uncertain , with densities of 10@xmath10  @xmath1 calculated from absorption measures in supernova remnants such as ic  443 @xcite .",
    "a survey of 35 supernova remnants , a star - forming region and four fields in the large and small magellanic clouds at 6049 , 6030 and 6035  mhz was conducted using the parkes methanol multibeam receiver on the parkes radio telescope .",
    "eleven 6035 and three 6030  mhz oh masers associated with star - forming regions were detected .",
    "two new 6035  mhz masers , one with associated 6030  mhz maser emission , were found . where possible , magnetic fields were derived from the zeeman splitting of the polarisations .",
    "no 6049  mhz maser emission was detected in any of the fields to a 3-@xmath36 level of 0.30.6  jy / beam .",
    "this places a limit on the column density of the oh in the supernova remnants .    for a typical supernova remnant such as g349.7 + 0.2 , this limit is @xmath85  @xmath1 , indicating that if the column density of oh was above this value , 6049  mhz maser emission would have been observed .",
    "however , this conflicts with results obtained by @xcite that indicate that the column density is @xmath12  @xmath1 in sections of the remnant where 1720  mhz oh masers are found .",
    "several explanations could account for this discrepancy , such as the filling factor accounting for the size of the maser spot compared to the beam being too high or the continuum temperature being more variable over the beam than anticipated , but are not likely .",
    "another possibility is that the velocity coherence is too low under some conditions for the 6049  mhz oh masers to be produced , while still high enough for 1720  mhz oh masers to be produced .",
