    "supergiant fast x  ray transients ( sfxts ) are a sub - class of high mass x  ray binaries ( hmxbs ) recently discovered by integral during the galactic plane monitoring @xcite .",
    "they are firmly associated ( via optical spectroscopy ) with an o or b supergiant and display outbursts which are significantly shorter than typical be / x - ray binaries , characterized by bright flares with a duration of a few hours and peak luminosities of 10@xmath710@xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "the quiescence , characterized by a soft spectrum ( likely thermal ) and a low luminosity at @xmath10  erg  s@xmath9 is a rarely - observed state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as their spectral properties resemble those of accreting pulsars , it is generally assumed that all members of the new class are hmxbs hosting a neutron star , although the only three sfxts with a measured pulse period are ax  j1841.0@xmath10536 ( @xmath11s , @xcite ) , igr  j112155952 ( @xmath12s , @xcite ) , and igr  j184830311 ( @xmath13s , @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for the observed short outbursts are still being debated .",
    "the proposed explanations ( see @xcite , for a recent review ) mainly involve the structure of the wind from the supergiant companion @xcite , or the possible presence of gated mechanisms ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the latter are due to the properties of the accreting neutron star ( magnetar - like magnetic fields and slow pulse periods ) which can halt the accretion for most of the time .    during february 2007",
    ", we monitored the outburst of the periodic sfxt igr  j11215@xmath15952 @xcite with _ swift _ @xcite , in what became the most complete and deep set of x  ray observations of an outburst of a sfxt .",
    "thanks to these observations , we discovered that the accretion phase during the bright outburst lasts much longer than a few hours .",
    "the orbital dependence of the accretion x  ray luminosity during the outburst led us to propose an alternative explanation for the outburst mechanism in igr  j11215@xmath15952 @xcite , linked to the possible presence of a second wind component , in the form of a preferred plane for the outflowing wind from the supergiant donor .",

    ", we have obtained multi - wavelength observations of 5 outbursts of 3 different sources ( see table  [ sfxt5:tab : campaign ] ) .",
    "as reported in @xcite , we studied the broad - band simultaneous spectra ( 0.3150kev ) of three sfxts .",

    "this was already emerging from the first four months of this campaign @xcite , but now we have accumulated enough statistics to allow intensity selected spectroscopy of the out - of - outburst emission .",
    "spectral fits performed adopting simple models , such as an absorbed power law or a blackbody ( more complex models were not required by the data ) result in hard power law photon indices ( always in the range @xmath95@xmath50.82 ) or in hot black bodies ( kt@xmath221@xmath512  kev ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the statistics now accumulated allow us to constrain well the spectral parameters of the intermediate level of x  ray emission : in particular , when a blackbody model is adopted , the resulting radii of the emitter for all 4 sfxts ( and all the intensity states ) is _ always only _ a few hundred meters ( note that even with several kpc of uncertainty in the distance determination , the emitting regions are always significantly smaller than the neutron star radius ) . this is clearly indicative of an emitting region which is only a fraction of the neutron star surface , and can be associated in a natural way with the polar caps of the neutron star , @xcite .",
    "this evidence , coupled with the high level of flux variability and hard x  ray spectra , strongly supports the fact that the intermediate and low intensity level of sfxts is produced by the accretion of matter onto the neutron star , demonstrating that sfxts are sources which do not spend most of their lifetime in quiescence .",
    "this observational evidence rules out all models for the sfxts emission which predict that the sfxts are in quiescence when they are not in outburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "j16479@xmath14514 a contribution to the time spent in inactivity is due to the x  ray eclipses , hence the above 17% is in fact an upper limit to the true quiescent time . in the latter three sfxts",
    "this inactivity duty cycle , where the sources are undetected with @xmath0 , can be associated with the true quiescence ( that is , no accretion ) and/or with an accretion at a very low rate .",

    "this latter value is consistent with the quiescent state observed in igr  j17544@xmath12619 during a @xmath224 observation [ 5.2@xmath225@xmath22210@xmath223  erg  s@xmath9 , 0.510 kev ; @xcite ] , although the two spectra are very different . during the @xmath224 observation the spectrum was very soft , likely thermal ( fitted with a power law resulted in a photon index @xmath95=5.9@xmath226 ) , whereas our accumulated spectrum during the very low intensity state is much harder ( @xmath95@xmath512 ) , very likely implying low rate accretion onto the compact object .",
    "the lowest level of x  ray emission ever detected from xte  j1739302 has been observed with asca [ 1.1@xmath22210@xmath195  erg  @xmath25  s@xmath9 , 210 kev ; @xcite ] , which is much lower than that observed with @xmath0 .",
    "this comparison , together with the hard spectrum and the small emitting radius ( see table  [ sfxt5:tab : specfits ] ) observed with @xmath0  implies that we have not reached the quiescent state in this source . besides igr  j17544@xmath12619 , the only other sfxts where the quiescence ( characterized by a soft thermal spectrum and a very low luminosity of @xmath510@xmath223  erg  s@xmath9 ) has been caught is igr  j084084503 @xcite .",
    "the low intensity level we observe with @xmath0  in igr  j16479@xmath14514 is consistent with it being due to the x  ray eclipses .",
    "the possibility of an x  ray eclipse in this transient was originally suggested by @xcite , based on the variability of the iron line emission observed during an xmm - newton observation .",
    "then , @xcite found a periodicity at 3.32  days , suggesting it as a possible orbital period .",
    "we were able to confirm this periodicity from our independent analysis of the bat data .",
    "if we assume that this periodicity is of orbital origin , and consider a duration of the x@xmath1ray eclipse of 0.6  days @xcite , then the inclination _",
    "i _ of the system can be derived from the eclipse semi - angle , @xmath227 , for an assumed supergiant radius [ @xmath228  r@xmath229 for a o8.5 supergiant , @xcite ] as @xmath230 . assuming the system parameters previously adopted for igr  j164794514",
    ", we obtain a binary separation @xmath231  cm , implying an orbital inclination of @xmath232 .",
    "this 3.32  days periodicity , if interpreted as the orbital period of the binary system , is puzzling , and is very difficult to reconcile with all the mechanisms proposed to explain the sfxts phenomenon .",
    "the out - of - eclipse average x@xmath1ray luminosity of igr  j164794514 is @xmath233  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "it can be compared with the x@xmath1ray emission expected from bondi - hoyle accretion onto a neutron star .",
    "let us assume a circular orbit ( very likely , given the short period ) , a stellar mass of @xmath234  m@xmath229 , a radius @xmath228  r@xmath229 for the supergiant @xcite , a beta - law velocity for the supergiant wind @xmath235 with @xmath236 , and a conservative high terminal velocity @xmath237  km  s@xmath9 . under these assumptions",
    "the x@xmath1ray luminosity produced by the wind accretion for a reasonable choice of the wind mass loss rate ( @xmath238  m@xmath229  yr@xmath9 ) is @xmath5@xmath239  erg  s@xmath9 , about 23 order of magnitude higher than the observed luminosity . on the other hand , the observed low luminosity can be obtained only at a wind mass loss rate of @xmath240  m@xmath229  yr@xmath9 , which is not reasonable for a o8.5 supergiant .",
    "a viable explanation to this inconsistency could be that the 3.32  days periodicity is not orbital , but is only one of the periodicities predicted in our model for the explanation of sfxts outbursts , that is the time interval between the periodically recurrent flares when the neutron star passes throught the preferential plane for the outflowing wind from the supergiant , twice per orbit ; thus , the true orbital period can be much longer than this periodicity found [ see the different geometries proposed in @xcite ] .     and [ sfxt5:fig : specfits2 ] . for the `",
