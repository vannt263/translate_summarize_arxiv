    "the prompt emission and afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be manifestations of ultrarelativistic shock waves , propagating in media where the large scale upstream magnetization is too weak to affect the shock structure , and too weak , if simply compressed by the shock , to provide the magnetization inferred from synchrotron models of the burst emission ( see piran 2005ab and references therein ) .",
    "the weakly magnetized outflows in the rotational equators of rotation powered pulsars ( coroniti 1990 ) may also be sites of essentially unmagnetized shock waves terminating the relativistic winds in a region which occupies a finite latitude band with respect to the rotational equator of the underlying neutron star .",
    "yet the radiation from these systems has been modeled as being due to synchrotron radiation , which requires the presence of a magnetic field strong enough to deflect particles through a substantial fraction of their larmor orbits . at the very least ,",
    "this requires magnetic structures with amplitude , @xmath10 , whose characteristic dimensions , @xmath11 , are comparable to or larger than @xmath12 , for all particle energies inferred to contribute to the observed radiation .    unmagnetized anisotropic plasmas spontaneously generate small - scale magnetic fields via the weibel instability ( weibel 1959 ) .",
    "shocks have strong plasma anisotropy in the transition layer separating the upstream and downstream media , as well as in the foreshock where downstream particles escape into the upstream , which provides the free energy for generating magnetic fields with spatial scales on the order of the plasma skin depth , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the plasma frequency .",
    "medvedev and loeb ( 1999 ) and gruzinov and waxman ( 1999 ) argued that the relativistic form of this instability ( yoon & davidson 1987 ) could macroscopically magnetize the downsteam plasma where the grb radiation arises ( larmor radii small compared to flow scale ) . through numerical and analytic studies , they and various authors ( silva _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 , medvedev _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) have argued that the instability forms filaments of electric current and @xmath15 field .",
    "these filaments merge and cause magnetic energy to cascade from the initial microscopic scale @xmath16 to larger scales .",
    "thus , the filamented plasma becomes magnetized with a @xmath15 field hypothesized to survive throughout a large fraction of the shocked medium .",
    "such inverse cascades have been observed in 2d and 3d particle - in - cell simulations in the _ foreshock _ region , the part of the shock structure where the upstream and downstream media interpenetrate and the stream filamentation modes grow from noise with most incoming particles still undeflected from the upstream flow .",
    "simulations show that current filaments merge and grow in amplitude until they reach the magnetic trapping limit , where the filament currents and their magnetic fields become comparable to the alfven limit ( davidson _ et al .",
    "_ 1972 ; kato 2005 ; also see milosavljevic , nakar , & spitkovsky 2006 ; milosavljevic & nakar 2006a ) .",
    "at that point the particles orbits on the filament boundaries become chaotic , the filaments disorganize , and scattering from the disorganized magnetic fluctuations halts the streaming of the bulk of the plasma , isotropizing and thermalizing the flow , all within a layer tens to hundreds of skin depths thick ( spitkovsky 2005 ) , in accord with kato ( 2005 ) s model for shock formation .",
    "the magnetic energy is as high as 10 - 20% of the bulk plasma flow energy _ within this scattering layer _ , where the density jump between upstream and downstream occurs .",
    "these initially small - scale b - fields must survive for tens of thousands to millions of inverse plasma periods to serve as the source of the magnetization invoked in synchrotron models of grb emission ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; piran 2005ab ; katz , keshet , & waxman 2007 ) .",
    "long - lived fields are also required in diffusive fermi acceleration ( dfa ) models used to explain the appearance of the nonthermal particle spectra observed through their synchrotron and inverse compton emission in grbs , and in pulsar wind nebulae ( pwns ) and other sites of nonthermal photon emission in relativistic flows . however , present simulations ( kazimura _ et al .",

    ", we show via linear theory that the phase mixing between individual particles and organized macroscopic currents implies rapid decay of the magnetic energy in the downstream medium .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the essential features of the plasma produced by the shock via numerical simulations in  [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "these simulations show the downstream magnetic structures are non - propagating in the frame of the downstream medium , and are intermittent spatially , organized into clumps and filaments of magnetic field with typical diameter @xmath1 skin depths , immersed into a highly isotropic plasma . in this downstream isotropic",
    "maxwellian particle distribution , we calculate the damping rates from vlasov linear response theory , assuming the particles are unmagnetized ( larmor radii @xmath17 magnetic clump diameter ) , recovering a result due to mikhailovskii ( 1979 ) in  [ sec : theory ] and appendix a. taking snapshots from the simulations as initial conditions , we calculate the decay of the magnetic field as a function of time and position , and compare these theoretical calculations with simulations .",
    "we find that the theory does reasonably well in estimating the decay rate of the total magnetic energy as @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "however , it overestimates the damping rate of shorter wavelength modes .",
    "we speculate in  [ sec : trap ] that this discrepancy may result from the magnetic trapping of a large fraction of the particles , which suppresses the disorganizing effect of phase mixing on the currents .",
    "we also discuss the effects of an inverse cascade on the persistence of magnetic fields , though we find little evidence for its relevance from numerical simulations .",
    "we summarize our results and draw some implications for fermi acceleration and for the magnetization required for synchrotron emission in models of grbs and other systems in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "spitkovsky ( 2005 ) and spitkovsky and arons ( in prep ) describe a series of 2d and 3d simulations of relativistic shock waves in @xmath0 plasmas , for varying values of the upstream magnetic field @xmath20 , including @xmath21 .",
    "these are particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations ( birdsall and langdon 1991 ) , using the code _ tristan - mp _ , developed by one of us ( as ) .",

    "although we track all three velocity and field components , due to the two - dimensional symmetry only particle velocities in the plane of the simulation are non - zero for initially cold flow , and only the out - of - plane component of the magnetic field is excited by in - plane currents .",
    "in - plane electrostatic fields are also included .    the interaction of the reflected pair plasma with the incoming stream forms a shock , which propagates toward the plasma injection surface . in the simulations , one plasma skin depth spans 10 cells based on the upstream parameters , i.e. , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the upstream total density of electrons and positrons ( as measured in the frame of the simulation ) , @xmath25 is the upstream plasma frequency , and @xmath26 is the upstream flow energy / particle .",

    "the longest simulation was evolved for @xmath29 .",
    "we have checked , by using boxes of increasing transverse dimension , that the periodic boundary conditions used on the transverse coordinate do not affect the scale of the magnetic structures formed . in the results exhibited below",
    ", we use @xmath30 particles per cell ( @xmath31 per species ) in order to suppress particle noise , which enables us to follow the dynamics of small amplitude fields .",
    "we have performed convergence studies , varying the number @xmath32 of particles per cell from @xmath33 to @xmath30 , confirming that the noise level decreases as @xmath34 , while the gross qualities of the shock structure remain the same .",
    "figure [ fig : shock ] shows the snapshots of density and magnetic energy from a typical 2d simulation . in terms of the _ upstream _ kinetic energy density , instead of the downstream thermal energy density as is a common practice in the grb community ( c.f .",

    "coordinates are in units of the upstream skin depth , @xmath28 . in the simulation shown ,",
    "the upstream flow moves to the left with @xmath35 .",
    "our simulations are large enough to permit the complete development of the shock and show the main features of contemporary collisionless shock simulations even in reduced dimensionality .",
    "for instance , we see the factor of @xmath36 increase in density between the upstream and the downstream ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shock]c ) , which is the expected compression factor for this 2d plasma when the plasma properties are measured in the rest frame of the downstream plasma ( gallant _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; spitkovsky and arons , in prep ) .",
    "current filaments ( geometrically , these are out - of - plane sheets ) show up as the enhancement in plasma density and magnetic energy density in the foreshock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shock]ab ) .",
    "the scale of the filaments grows towards the shock through merging .",
    "the shock is located where the density filaments completely merge and are replaced by a quasi - homogeneous medium .",
    "the subject of the saturation of the weibel instability will be explored in greater detail by spitkovsky and arons ( in prep ) .    at the shock transition layer ,",
    "the filaments disorganize and become clumps of magnetic energy ( in 2d the only appreciable magnetic component is the out of plane @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that these magnetic clumps lose intensity the further downstream they are from the shock ( figure [ fig : shock]b ) .",
    "the magnetic energy peaks before the density completes its rise ( as we see in comparing c and d in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] ) , i.e. , the instability saturates at the alfven critical current before the shock fully develops .",
    "we also note that the particle distribution function changes from an anisotropic free - streaming population to an isotropic ( in the downstream rest frame ) thermal population . in the downstream medium , we find that the difference between the perpendicular and parallel momentum is extremely small , @xmath38 .    as figures [ fig : shock ]",
    "b and d suggest , even though locally in the shock magnetic energy can reach close to equipartition ( @xmath39 when averaged over the transverse dimension ) , the magnetic fields decay in the downstream region of the shock . to study this in further detail , we present several cross sections of the plasma at times separated by 450 @xmath40 in figure [ fig : shock later ] . since our simulation is performed in the downstream frame ( frame of the reflecting wall ) , we see the shock propagate through the box at @xmath41 ( value appropriate for 2d relativistic gas ) .",
    "downstream from the shock , the magnetic clumps weaken as a function of time and appear to be non - propagating . in figure",
    "[ fig : shock later ] , we see this in panels a - d and in the black through blue curves in panel e , which show magnetic energy averaged over the transverse dimension of the simulation at times from panels a - d .",
    "although the separation between prominent clumps that have larger field strength seems to increase with time , this is due to the faster disappearance of small - scale clumps , presumably due to decay , while the location or size of strong clumps does not significantly evolve .",
    "there is little evidence for clump merging far from the shock . in figure",
    "[ fig : shock later ] we also plot a vertical line showing the location where we will decompose the magnetic fields into fourier modes later in  3 , in order to study the comparison of the theory of b - field decay with the numerical experiments .",
    "finally , we mention that 3d shock simulations also show similar behavior ( including the lack of substantial downstream merging of magnetic structures ) for the shorter times that can be followed with present 3d simulations .",
    "topologically , the magnetic clumps in 2d become large looping structures in 3d .",
    "if our 2d plane is thought of as a slice through a 3d simulation , the 3d loops connect field emerging from one clump and returning to another .",
    "the orientation of 3d loops would be mostly perpendicular to the original direction of the flow .",
    "the particle distribution function is also an isotropic , relativistic maxwellian in the downstream region .",
    "the simulations summarized in  [ sec : simulation ] suggest that magnetic turbulence decays in the isotropic post - shock plasma .",
    "we now attempt to understand this theoretically with the goal of finding a model that allows extrapolation of the magnetic evolution beyond the length of time that can be studied in direct shock simulations .",
    "the simulations show that the downstream plasma is isotropic and the downstream particle distribution function is well described by a relativistic maxwellian . for the purposes of this section , we _ assume _ the downstream field amplitudes are so small that magnetic trapping is unimportant for almost all particles ; therefore , their orbits are almost straight lines .",
    "we will revisit this assumption in  [ sec : trap ] .",
    "we begin by deriving the linear plasma response for electromagnetic fluctuations in an isotropic relativistic plasma with small field fluctuations ( mikhailovskii 1979 ) .",
    "the vlasov equation for each species is @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the species label , @xmath44 for positrons and @xmath45 for electrons , with @xmath46 .",
    "we linearize this equation with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with the initial conditions downstream of the shock that tell us that @xmath50 and @xmath10 are small in the sense that @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52 is also small .",
    "the linearized vlasov equation is @xmath53 the plasma couples to the field through the maxwell equations @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the current density .",
    "we orient coordinates so that @xmath56 is along @xmath57 , the wave vector lies along @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is along @xmath60 .",

    ". we will assume by charge neutrality that in the downstream plasma @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that the sum over equal mass species is trivial .",
    "the dispersion relation for normal modes in the plasma plus electromagnetic field is @xmath75 however , we emphasize that the linear relation between the currents and the electric field ( eq.[[eq : j2e ] ] ) through the susceptibility ( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) applies to all ( small amplitude ) fluctuations , not only to normal modes .",
    "we evaluate equation ( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) for distribution functions that are isotropic in two and three dimensions in appendix a. for a two - dimensional isotropic distribution function , we write @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and perform the integral over @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "for a three - dimensional isotropic distribution function , we write @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . in the three - dimensional case , we confirm mikhailovskii s ( 1979 ) result for a relativistic isotropic plasma .",
    "as we show explicitly in equation ( [ eq : worked out suscept ] ) , subluminal waves ( @xmath82 ) are damped , where @xmath83 .",
    "the basic physics is that of landau damping ( stix 1992 ) or more precisely , phase mixing . for a subluminous wave in an isotropic relativistic plasma with @xmath84",
    ", there always exists some angle @xmath85 between the wave vector @xmath86 and a particle s momentum where a particle moving with speed @xmath87 is in phase with the field component , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "when the phase velocity of the field fluctuations is very small compared to the thermal speeds of the particles ( which includes the zero wave velocity case , @xmath89 ) , landau damping takes on the character of simple phase - mixing .",
    "the currents , which support the field fluctuations , are composed of particles .",
    "these current carrying particles have random motions which carry them out of the magnetic structure , which the currents initially support .",
    "as a result , these currents and their magnetic field fluctuations are disorganized ( or damped ) on the transit times of the particles across the field fluctations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the formal theory includes both this phase mixing limit of the damping process and the limit in which the phase 4-speeds @xmath90 of the fields fourier components are high compared to the particles random 4-speeds @xmath91 .",
    "the applicable limit depends on whether the wave phase 4-velocity is large or small compared to the mean 4-velocity of the particles in the distribution function .",
    "hammett , dorland & perkins ( 1992 ) present a simple picture of this process in the case of non - relativistic electrostatic waves .",
    "arons , norman & max ( 1977 ) show how phase mixing works for electromagnetic waves in a relativistic maxwellian plasma . in any case",
    ", the end result is that there is a net power flow from fields to particles , _",
    "i.e. _ the fields decay , which we will demonstrate explicitly below .",
    "we now study the action of such a plasma on an arbitary field of initial b - field pertubations as generated by the weibel mediated shock .",
    "we evaluate equation ( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) numerically for two and three dimensions setting @xmath92 , because of the non - propagating nature of the magnetic clumps , which we infer from visual inspection of the simulations . in the limit @xmath93",
    ", we find : @xmath94 note that the 2d and 3d results only vary by a numerical factor .",
    "hence , long wavelength modes have the same qualitative behavior in two and three dimensions .",
    "the plasma susceptibility , which we calculate in appendix a ( see also eq.[[eq : chi_limit ] ] ) , can be utilized to calculate the evolution , i.e. , the damping or growth , of an initial field of fluctuations .",
    "appendix b contains this calculation in more detail ; the result is @xmath95 where @xmath96 ( see also eq.[[eq : app_general gamma ] ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic forms of @xmath67 from equation ( [ eq : chi_limit ] ) for 3d and 2d gives ( see also eq.[[eq : app_gamma ] ] ) @xmath97    we now compare the expectations from linear response theory to the numerical simulations .",
    "we begin by taking the fourier transform of @xmath10 from our 2d numerical simulations from a downstream region where the shock is fully developed , _",
    "i.e. _ , behind the shock front at @xmath98 , @xmath99 we evolve @xmath100 in accordance to equation ( [ eq : damping ] ) using the asymptotic forms in equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and compare our analytically evolved spectra with the numerical simulation at later times . in figure",
    "[ fig : fftsingle ] , we take the initial data from a region at @xmath101 , which we marked with a line in figure [ fig : shock later ] . to accumulate sufficient statistics , we average the fields over @xmath102 in the flow direction .",
    "we evolve these spectra for 450 ( red ) , 900 ( green ) , and 1350 @xmath103 ( blue ) using equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and compare this to snapshots taken from our numerical simulations at these times .",
    "theory and simulation agree at very low wavenumber ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , theory overpredicts the cutoff in power at larger k. the discrepancy suggests that linear theory is insufficient to describe the nature of downstream magnetic turbulence and that additional physics is needed ( see  [ sec : trap ] ) .",
    "the lack of power in short wavelength modes suggests that the total b - field is determined by long wavelength modes .",
    "we now use equation ( [ eq : damping ] ) to find a simple decay law for the total b - field : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is defined in equation ( [ eq : fourier transform ] ) . inserting equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) into ( [ eq : fourier evolution ] ) and integrating , with @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the long wavelength spectral index and @xmath109 normalizes the amplitude , we find @xmath110 where we have taken @xmath111 without loss of generality , @xmath112 in 3d and @xmath113 ( 2d ) ,",
    "@xmath114 is small such that @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the gamma function .",
    "note that @xmath14 is for the downstream plasma frequency .",
    "however , this detail is irrelevant in terms of determining the power law as a function of @xmath117 .",
    "setting @xmath118 to be small is a safe approximation in the simulations , and of course is excellent in much larger astrophysical systems .",
    "thus if the initial spatial spectrum is a power law in wave number @xmath119 , then the theory predicts @xmath120 .",
    "we study the region immediately following the peak of magnetic energy in the shock front ( where it reaches @xmath121 ) at @xmath122 and plot its value as a function of position in the postshock region . for a shock moving at constant velocity",
    ", we have @xmath123 .",
    "hence @xmath124 .",
    "our numerical simulations are extremely suggestive that the magnetic energy density follows the @xmath125 decay expected for an initially flat magnetic spectrum at early times , then steepens to a @xmath126 decay at later times as shown in figure [ fig : eb ] , until the noise finally swamps the signal .",

    "this @xmath126 decay rate would imply an initial spatial index of @xmath127 at low wavenumber , though our analysis of additional simulations with a large transverse spatial scale suggest @xmath128 .",
    "the difference in the index of the decay law expected from the theory and measured from the simulations may be due to magnetic trapping ( see  [ sec : trap ] ) .",
    "gruzinov ( 2001b ) offered an alternative explanation of @xmath126 decay of the magnetic energy density observed in 2d simulations of weibel instability in counterpropagating pair plasmas . in that simulation",
    "the beams were moving perpendicular to the simulation plane . in order to explain the field decay , gruzinov ( 2001b ) had to assume that the magnetic structures increase their size at the alfven velocity . in our shock simulations ,",
    "the downstream magnetic structures do not significantly expand (  2 ) , hence the similarity of decay law between the two simulations is likely a coincidence .",
    "the picture of filament expansion and merging of gruzinov ( 2001b ) is likely valid very close to the shock , but is not observed in the longer evolution of the downstream plasma .",
    "our simulations and theory suggest power law @xmath18 with @xmath7 temporal decay of the total magnetic energy density in rough agreement with each other .",
    "however , linear theory and numerical simulations disagree on the decay rate for short wavelengths , which hinders a determination of the ultimate fate of the fields on times longer than several thousand plasma periods .",
    "this discrepancy may arise from the nonlinear effects of magnetic trapping .",
    "particles in the magnetic fields do not follow straight line trajectories that are weakly perturbed , but are partially trapped and strongly deflected .",
    "we illustrate this point from following test particles orbits in numerical simulations in figure [ fig : trapped ] .",
    "the test particles suffer large deflections from straight - line orbits as they encounter magnetic clumps .",
    "therefore , the larmor radii of many of the test particles are of the same order of the sizes of these clumps or smaller . indeed closer inspection of some of the test particle orbits that are embedded inside the clumps suggests that they are completely trapped .",
    "we have studied the downstream evolution of magnetic turbulence in the context of a collisionless @xmath0 shock both analytically and numerically .",
    "our large scale 2d simulations show the formation of filaments in the foreshock region which merge and grow until they reach the shock transition region . past the shock transition region",
    ", these filaments break up into magnetic clumps in a quasi - homogenous medium where the background particle distribution function is an isotropic maxwellian .",
    "in such a background , we showed that magnetic energy will decay like @xmath18 with @xmath130 due to untrapped particle phase mixing , which is broadly consistent with our numerical simulations . in detail , the theoretical decay rates depend more strongly on wavelength than is seen in the numerical experiments .",
    "we suggested that magnetic trapping may play an important role in resolving this discrepancy .",
    "trapping can lead to mhd - like behavior and possible long time persistence of some of the magnetic energy in spatially intermittent , more strongly magnetized subregions .",
    "this effect is a subject of further study .",
    "magnetic field decay may be alleviated via an inverse cascade from small scales to large scales .",
    "an inverse cascade via current filament merging operates strongly in the _ foreshock _ region ( silva _ et al . _",
    "2003 ; spitkovsky 2005 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear if this picture can be applied to the downstream region .",
    "the magnetic filaments so prevalent in the upstream region are gone and are replaced by isolated magnetic clumps ( loops ) , a result common to both 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "filament merging does occur , but is confined to the foreshock , where the filaments exist .",
    "we see little evidence of merging magnetic clumps .",
    "this is reinforced by katz _",
    "( 2007 ) , who suggest via self - similar arguments that the inverse cascade does not operate downstream of the shock .",
    "hence , the magnetic energy should damp away in the downstream region .",
    "we have not studied in detail how these magnetic clumps are confined in the downstream plasma .",
    "however , fujita et al . ( 2006 ) have found these same magnetic clumps in simulation of the non - relativistic weibel instability that is appropriate for galaxy clusters . in this case",
    ", they argue that pressure of the external medium confines these magnetic clumps .",
    "the strong perturbation from straight line motion , which we studied in  [ sec : trap ] for test particles , suggest that the magnetic clumps in our simulation are also sensitive to momentum transfer between particles and itself .",
    "that is , the magnetic clumps in our simulations are also confined by external pressure .",
    "whatever the final fate of the spatially intermittent fields , our study of the nature of @xmath0 shocks suggests that the belief in the persistence of weibel generated magnetic fields with strengths comparable to those appearing within the shock transition is overly optimistic .",
    "magnetic field energies tend to decline rapidly after about a few hundred plasma skin depths .",
    "only the very long term evolution is still open to some question , i.e. , does @xmath131 settle at some value smaller than @xmath3 , or does the spatially intermittent magnetic field decline to zero ?",
    "the rapid decay suggested by our analysis puts severe constraints on the synchrotron emission mechanisms for grbs .",
    "the width of the emitting region is @xmath132 ( piran 2005b ) , which is much larger than the region over which we expect magnetic fields to persist .",
    "however , decaying magnetic fields may not be inconsistent with grb observations .",
    "peer & zhang ( 2006 ) suggest that the prompt emission from the internal shock may be more consistent with a decaying magnetic field component rather than a persistent field component .",
    "a field that persists over a scale of @xmath133 plasma skin depths fits the spectra better at low - energies than a field that persists over the entire thickness of the shell ( @xmath134 plasma skin depths ) .",
    "small magnetized regions may also be important in the context of the afterglow ( rossi & rees 2003 ) .    in young pulsar wind nebulae ,",
    "post shock magnetic fields averaged over the whole latitudinal extent of the observed emission tori have energy densities of a few percent of the post shock plasma energy density .",
    "it is possible that weaker magnetic fields exist near the midplane of the equatorial flow , a region of particular interest to the conversion of flow energy into the observed nonthermally emitting spectra of @xmath135 .",
    "if so , the weibel mediated shock dynamics studied here may be of relevance to these systems behavior .",
    "it is also possible that weak systematic upstream magnetic fields are of essential importance , and that shocks in completely unmagnetized plasmas are an oversimplification .",
    "suprathermal particle generated at the relativistic shock front may alter the basic physics of the collisionless shock , if a mean field is present .",
    "milosavljevic and nakar ( 2006b ) argue accelerated particles streaming into the _ upstream _ magnetized medium can drive long wavelength , magnetized turbulence with @xmath136 , which might persist into the downstream and provide the magnetization required in phenomenological models of grb and pwn emission .",
    "then the shock mediated by weibel turbulence becomes a subshock within a much larger extended structure , responsible only for thermalizing the bulk of the flow and injecting the particles that are fermi accelerated in the turbulence generated by high energy particle streaming .",
    "this is a relativistic version of bell s ( 1978 ) ( also see bell 2004 , 2005 ) picture of particle acceleration in non - relativistic shocks .",
    "finally , we briefly mention the extension of this theory to electron - ion plasmas .",
    "let us presume initially that the ions and electrons are isotropic but remain decoupled , i.e. , a two - temperature relativistic plasma .",

    "depending on the relative values of the electron temperature and ion temperature , one term may dominate .",
    "however , initial large - scale simulations of ion - electron collisionless shocks suggest that both reach roughly equipartition with each other ( spitkovsky 2007 ) , thereby reproducing the physics of the @xmath142 shock . in this case , the relativistic electrons and ions contribute equally to the decay rate because thermal equipartition prevails , i.e. , @xmath143 .",

    "<S> the model is based on the small value of the downstream magnetic energy density , which suggests that particle orbits are only weakly perturbed from straight line motion , if the turbulence is homogeneous . using linear kinetic theory applied to electromagnetic fields in an isotropic , relativistic maxwellian plasma </S>",
    "<S> , we find a simple analytic form for the damping rates , @xmath5 , in two and three dimensions for small amplitude , subluminous electromagnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that magnetic energy does damp due to phase mixing of current carrying particles as @xmath6 with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this overall decay compares well to that found in simulations , since it depends primarily on the longest wavelength modes , @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> we speculate that magnetic trapping of a substantial fraction of the particles within the highly spatially intermittent downstream magnetic structures may be the origin of this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , trapping may form the basis for mhd - like behavior , permitting a small fraction of the initial magnetic energy to persist for times much greater than have been followed in the simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we briefly speculate on other physical processes , which depend on the presence of suprathermal particles , that may cause the generation of longer wavelength magnetic fields that create a magnetized plasma ( @xmath9 ) , in which the damping is not as fast . however , absent such additional physical processes , we conclude that initially unmagnetized relativistic shocks in electron - positron plasmas are unable to form persistent downstream magnetic fields . </S>",
