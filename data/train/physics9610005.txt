    "discussions of the magnetic confinement of plasmas and their stability usually begin with the subject of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equilibria .",
    "@xcite in the present generation of devices , dominated by the tokamak concept , the magnetofluids usually carry currents and contain strong dc magnetic fields whose sources are in external coils .    since the earliest days of fusion research ,",
    "the various mhd equilibria have been treated as ideal .",
    "they are assumed to have infinite electrical conductivity and no flow , so that ohm s law , @xmath2 is satisfied by taking all three terms equal to zero . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the electric field , @xmath4 is the fluid velocity , @xmath5 is the electrical current density , and @xmath6 is the electrical conductivity , allowed to become infinite . in familiar `` alfvenic '' dimensionless units , the curl of the magnetic field @xmath7 is just @xmath5 , and of course , the divergences of @xmath7 and @xmath5 are zero . in the limit of infinite conductivity ,",
    "the sharp connection that must exist between @xmath3 and @xmath5 for large but finite conductivity is , of course , destroyed .",
    "there have been attempts to reintroduce the effects of finite conductivity ( _ e.g. _ , see grad and hogan @xcite ) , but these attempts are in our opinion not a satisfactory resolution ; too many possibilities are raised to be able to deal with any one of them conclusively .    with the infinite conductivity assumption ,",
    "the only remaining mhd requirement for equilibrium is one of mechanical force balance , with the local lorentz force @xmath8 taken equal to @xmath9 , the mechanical pressure gradient .",
    "such ideal equilibria are plentiful @xcite and are not constrained by the ohm s law .",
    "the grad - shafranov formulation @xcite then provides a framework in which axisymmetric , toroidal ideal equilibria can be calculated .",
    "investigating the stability of such ideal equilibria can be a lengthy undertaking .",
    "this is particularly true when the program includes investigating the various `` resistive instabilities '' that the ideal equilibria may be thought heir to . aside from the questions of consistency raised by ignoring resistive terms when constructing the equilibria , but then including them in the linear stability analysis , the possibilities for uncovering new variants of non - ideal , normal modes growing about ideal steady states can seem almost limitless .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to re - open the subject of zero - flow mhd steady states by considering the implications of retaining eq .",
    "( [ eq : ohm ] ) with finite @xmath6 .",
    "attention will be confined to axisymmetric steady states with zero flow ( @xmath10 ) in the simplest toroidal geometry .",
    "a previous note by montgomery and shan @xcite reported a proof of a somewhat unanticipated result : no such equilibria exist for the case of spatially uniform @xmath6 . here , we inquire into what kinds of spatial dependences of the conductivity @xmath6 will permit axisymmetric , toroidal steady states without flow .",
    "we do not answer the question of how such conductivity profiles might occur , or indeed whether they are to be expected on physical grounds .",
    "the hydrodynamic precedent suggests the need for such inquiries , as illustrated by plane shear flows such as pipe flow , plane poiseuille flow , or flow around obstacles ( _ e.g. _ , see acheson @xcite ) . in the case of pipe flow , for example , a uniform pressure gradient balances the axial viscous body force in the steady state . in the `` ideal '' limit , both may be allowed to go to zero proportionately , but the connection between them must not be lost , or what was a well - determined ( parabolic ) velocity profile may become anything at all ; any axial velocity dependence upon radius is an acceptable steady state , clearly a nonsensical conclusion . yet the stability of each one of these possible profiles could be investigated _",
    "ad infinitum_.    it is perhaps worth remarking that in the absence of flow velocity , the situation described here is one of classical resistive magnetostatics , and may be treated by standard methods borrowed from electricity and magnetism textbooks .",
    "one can say that until a magnetofluid begins to flow , it does not know whether it is a solid piece of metal with a particular spatially - dependent electrical conductivity or a plasma .",
    "once the requirement of balancing the lorentz force against a scalar pressure gradient is met , none of the additional approximations or assumptions of magnetohydrodynamics _ per se",
    "_ need to be used for this problem .",
    "we also mention that recently , bates and lewis @xcite have developed mathematical machinery for treating toroidal equilibrium profiles in true toroidal coordinates .",
    "they were able to substantiate the result of montgomery and shan @xcite in considerably more detail .",
    "it is important that the point of view adopted here be stated clearly .",
    "we believe the full set of time - independent mhd equations , including resistivity , velocity fields , tensor transport coefficients , and realistic boundary conditions , are far too difficult to solve at this moment .",
    "this is the reason that nearly all mhd equilibrium theory has been ideal , and has omitted these effects , even when it has been asserted that `` resistive instabilities '' were being calculated .",
    "we are interested in moving as far as we can to remove the above restrictions , but we are also interested in doing so only by exhibiting explicit solutions to whatever problem is undertaken .",
    "we are fully aware of the desirability of including all of the complications . here , only one is included : finite resistivity .",
    "it is a new result that there exist finite - resistivity toroidal mhd equilibria without flow , which , in many ways , do not look vastly different from ideal equilibria . how these states that are exhibited here relate to more general toroidal solutions with flow and the other possible complications",
    "is a separate , and much harder , question .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we ask and answer the question of what kinds of spatial profiles of scalar conductivity will permit axisymmetric toroidal equilibria in the presence of a stationary , toroidal inductive electric field .",
    "a partial differential equation is developed which can be thought of as replacing the grad - shafranov equation . in sec .",
    "iii , particular cases are worked out in detail .",
    "implications are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , along with questions about possible developments and extensions of the theory .",
    "in toroidal geometry ( in contrast to the `` straight cylinder '' approximation @xcite ) , the steady - state maxwell equation , @xmath11 , has non - trivial implications for the zero - flow ohm s law .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 whose associated unit basis vectors are @xmath13 . the @xmath14 axis is the axis of symmetry of the torus , and @xmath15 is the midplane .",
    "axisymmetry implies that the components of each vector field are independent of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "the center line of the torus will be taken to be the circle @xmath17 .",
    "the toroidal cross section will be specified by giving some bounding curve in the @xmath18 plane that encloses this center line .",
    "we will choose a specific shape when illustrating the results of the formalism .",
    "the wall of the container will be idealized as a rigid conductor coated with a thin layer of insulating dielectric .",
    "we do not consider the slits and slots that are necessary in any conducting boundary to permit the driving ( toroidal ) electric field to penetrate and drive the toroidal current .",
    "the electric field @xmath19 will be assumed to result from a time - proportional magnetic flux ( @xmath14 direction ) which is confined to an axisymmetric iron core whose axis coincides with the @xmath14-axis and which lies entirely inside the `` hole in the doughnut '' of the torus .",
    "the iron core is assumed to be very long , so the inductive electric field it produces in response to a magnetic flux that increases linearly with time is independent of the @xmath14-coordinate .",
    "faraday s law then implies that @xmath20 only , where @xmath21 is the value of the electric field at @xmath22 . this is a highly simplified cartoon of a tokamak geometry , and it is not difficult to think of ways in which it could be made more realistic .",
    "for example , in a more refined model @xmath3 might contain the gradient of a function of both @xmath23 and @xmath14 that obeys laplace s equation .",
    "we do not consider here the possibility of a poloidal current density that could result from a tensor conductivity .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 has this form , which is dictated by maxwell s equations , has implications for @xmath24 : for a scalar conductivity @xmath6 , @xmath5 must also point in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath6 is a function , as yet unspecified , of both @xmath23 and @xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic field consists of a toroidal part @xmath25 , and a poloidal part @xmath26 whose curl must be @xmath5 : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the strength of the toroidal field at @xmath29 ; it is supported by external poloidal windings around the torus . the source for @xmath30 is @xmath5 , so that @xmath31 the boundary condition on the magnetic field is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the unit normal to the surface of the torus . thus the magnetic field lines will be assumed to be confined to the torus , and we do not inquire into the necessary external `` vertical field , '' or other current distribution required to satisfy boundary conditions on @xmath7 outside the torus .",
    "in addition to solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlb ] ) subject to the boundary condition , the remaining part of the problem is guaranteeing the force balance , @xmath34 .",
    "this can be done by taking the divergence of this relation and solving the resulting poisson equation for @xmath35 .",
    "in order for there to exist such a solution , it is necessary that @xmath36 for uniform @xmath6 , it is not possible @xcite to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : curljcb ] ) . in the present circumstance ,",
    "the question is asked : `` what profiles of @xmath37 make it possible to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : curljcb ] ) and then ultimately , eq .  ( [ eq : curlb ] ) ? '' note that we are not necessarily assuming either incompressibility or uniform mass density .",
    "if we derive @xmath30 from a vector potential , @xmath38 , and compute @xmath39 , we see that eq .",

    "\\label{eq : longone}\\ ] ]    the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : longone ] ) is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is any differentiable function of its argument .",
    "the only remaining equation to satisfy is eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlb ] ) , or @xmath43 , which can be written as @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellip ] ) is structurally similar to the grad - shafranov equation ; any choice of @xmath42 will lead to a partial differential equation for @xmath45 which must be solved subject to boundary conditions .",
    "however , a new restriction on the spatial conductivity is implied .",
    "namely , the toroidal current density @xmath46 must determine @xmath6 by @xmath47 the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig ] ) must always be positive , but seems otherwise unrestricted . in terms of the conventional poloidal flux function @xmath48",
    ", the conductivity @xmath6 is seen not to be a `` flux function . ''",
    "that is , it is not constant on a surface of constant @xmath49 , since it is the square of @xmath23 times a function of @xmath49 .",
    "it is often thought that @xmath6 should be constant on surfaces of constant @xmath49 , since it depends strongly on temperature and flux surfaces are often imagined to be surfaces of constant temperature .    for a specific form of the function @xmath42 , the problem of finding the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellip ] ) is straightforward ; justifying the spatial dependence of the conductivity implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig ] ) , however , is not .",
    "we pass now to the consideration of some special choices of the function @xmath42 and their consequences .",
    "we do not presently inquire into the physical basis of any possible choice of @xmath50 , such as , say , a maximum - entropy or minimum - energy choice .",
    "rather , we select two examples largely on the basis of algebraic simplicity , and also choose a toroidal cross section for which the equation becomes separable and the boundary conditions tractable .",
    "even then , both cases exhibit some complexity .      the simplest choice is to set @xmath42 equal to a positive constant @xmath51 , making the toroidal current density @xmath52 proportional to @xmath23 and independent of @xmath14 .",
    "it should be noted that this @xmath23-proportionality ( for vorticity ) was found useful by norbury @xcite in a study of vortex rings .",
    "these were ideal vortex rings , however , and required no external agency to maintain them against dissipation .",
    "this makes the conductivity @xmath6 vary as the square of @xmath23 , increasing toward the `` outboard '' side of the torus .",
    "( [ eq : ellip ] ) , with @xmath53 , may be solved by first noting that it has become a linear , inhomogeneous , partial differential equation , the general solution to which is any particular solution plus the most general solution of the associated homogeneous equation .",
    "a particular solution is @xmath54 .",
    "the remaining homogeneous equation is the equation for a vacuum poloidal axisymmetric magnetic field .",
    "an easy way to find this vacuum field is to rewrite it in terms of a magnetic scalar potential @xmath55 that obeys laplace s equation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary condition is @xmath58 over the toroidal surface .    satisfying this boundary condition over a curved surface is a difficult task ;",
    "@xcite see , however , bates and lewis.@xcite for illustrative purposes , we consider a torus with a rectangular cross section .",
    "we assume the toroidal boundaries to lie at @xmath59 , and at @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "the vanishing of the normal component of @xmath63 at these boundaries amounts to demanding that    [ eq : inhomoall ] @xmath64 @xmath65    the general solution of @xmath57 for @xmath55 can be written as @xmath66 \\sinh   \\left(kz + \\alpha_k \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the usual bessel and weber functions , respectively , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are arbitrary constants .",

    "the surfaces of constant pressure ( since the current is purely toroidal ) are guaranteed to coincide with the @xmath49-surfaces .    to see that contours of constant pressure coincide with constant @xmath49-surfaces ,",

    "the current contours , in this case , will be rather strange , since the current is simply constant on lines of constant r , inside the torus , right up to the boundary .",
    "the other case we wish to consider is that of a linear variation of @xmath42 , or @xmath103 proportional to the square of @xmath23 times @xmath104 .",
    "the resulting linear differential equation is now homogeneous , which results in an interesting , but imperfectly understood `` quantum '' phenomenon : a preference for certain ratios of width to height for the rectangular cross section , in the steady states .",
    "it is convenient for this case to re - cast the differential equation in terms of the magnetic flux function @xmath105 : @xmath106 we assume that the magnetofluid fills a torus with a rectangular cross section bounded by the planes @xmath59 , and the radii @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "2 , that no radical qualitative departures from the magnetic surfaces expected from a grad - shafranov treatment have been found ; the `` shafranov shift '' of the magnetic axis to the outboard side of the torus is clearly evident .",
    "the principal difference is the non - coincidence of the surfaces of constant conductivity and the magnetic surfaces .",
    "in this paper , we have provided a framework in which toroidal axisymmetric , resistive steady states can been constructed for the mhd equations with scalar conductivity .",
    "our approach is to search for a conductivity profile that permits such steady states to exist .",
    "admittedly , the result is artificial since no discussion has been given of how such a profile might arise , or be consistent with an energy equation .",
    "if ideal mhd had not dominated the subject of magnetic confinement theory for forty years , the exercise might be considered unmotivated . however , since the proof of the nonexistence of toroidal resistive steady states with uniform conductivity,@xcite the question has arisen whether _ any _ current profile will support a static mhd state ; here , we have answered this question affirmatively .",
    "we consider the formalism for constructing static toroidal resistive states , incomplete as it is , to be physically less objectionable than an ideal treatment , which in fact still underlies the vast majority of instability calculations .",
    "what actually seems more likely , based on earlier dynamical computations@xcite using the full three - dimensional mhd equations , is that _ velocity fields _ permit ohm s law to be satisfied in resistive steady states of confined magnetofluids .",
    "even if this conjecture is correct , though , the effects of finite flow will be bound up with that of the conductivity , which is virtually guaranteed to be spatially non - uniform .",
    "the satisfaction of the poloidal and toroidal components of both ohm s law and the equation of motion , simultaneously , is an arduous task when velocity fields are included ; at present , no one seems close to solving this problem .",
    "the situation becomes even more difficult if one demands that the pressure be derived from a local equation of state . in this case ,",
    "complete consistency demands the simultaneous satisfaction of an energy equation as well  a formidably difficult undertaking ( _ e.g. _ , see goodman@xcite ) .",
    "we should remark that the equilibria exhibited here could have been obtained formally as grad - shafranov equilibria with a constant poloidal current function , and with a proper choice of the pressure function .",
    "a demand for consistency with ohm s law leads again to a determination of the conductivity through eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig ] ) , with @xmath146 replaced by @xmath49 , and @xmath42 replaced by the derivative of the pressure function with respect to its argument ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we should remark on a perception of several decades ago , due to pfirsch and schlter,@xcite that difficulties associated with retaining ohm s law and finite resistivity led to difficulties for ideal mhd equilibrium theory .",
    "their resolution , though never absorbed to any significant degree in working models for tokamak equilibria , was to attempt to satisfy the ohm s law in perturbation theory by using it to calculate iteratively the two perpendicular components of a fluid velocity to be associated with any given ideal equilibrium .",
    "a velocity field was thus taken into account in the ohm s law , but not in the equation of motion . a perturbation expansion in inverse aspect ratio was also featured .",
    "the conclusion was reached that a universal plasma outflow existed ( sometimes loosely called a `` diffusion velocity '' ) that had to be compensated by `` sources '' of new plasma within the plasma interior ( never identified quantitatively ) .",
    "we can not accept this conclusion .",
    "the explicit examples shown here , which do not rely on any perturbation expansions or other approximations , demonstrate the existence of zero - flow non - ideal solutions without plasma losses , and as such explicitly contradict the pfirsch - schlter expressions for positive - definite outward flux .",
    "we do believe , however , that pfirsch and schlter were correct in their assumption that real - life toroidal mhd steady states will involve mass flows in a fundamental way .",
    "it is in a sense remarkable that there has been so little attention to this as yet unresolved problem .",
    "the main point seems to us to be the need for developing a renewed respect for the problem of determining allowed steady states of a plasma .",
    "neither present diagnostics nor present theoretical machinery permit it .",
    "the phasing out of the vocabulary that has arisen in connection with ideal steady states will require the passage of some time .",

    "<S> it was recently demonstrated that static , resistive , magnetohydrodynamic equilibria , in the presence of spatially - uniform electrical conductivity , do not exist in a torus under a standard set of assumed symmetries and boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty , which goes away in the `` periodic straight cylinder approximation , '' is associated with the necessarily non - vanishing character of the curl of the lorentz force , @xmath0 @xmath1 . here , </S>",
    "<S> we ask if there exists a spatial profile of electrical conductivity that permits the existence of zero - flow , axisymmetric resistive equilibria in a torus , and answer the question in the affirmative . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical properties of the conductivity profile are unusual ( the conductivity can not be constant on a magnetic surface , for example ) and whether such equilibria are to be considered physically possible remains an open question .    </S>"
