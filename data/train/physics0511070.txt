    "laser - driven ion sources @xcite are considered to be the hot candidates for various important applications in nuclear physics , medicine , biology , material sciences , plasma field tomography @xcite . when multi - terawatt laser pulses are shot on solid state targets , copious amounts of multi - mev ions - both protons and highly charged heavier ions -",
    "are generated @xcite .",
    "these laser - generated ion beams have picosecond durations and originate from a few micrometer wide virtual source .",
    "however , the laser - generated ions are highly divergent and usually are emitted within a cone with some 10 - 30 degrees opening angle . in addition , they have broad energy spectra .",
    "these facts may impede numerous applications for the laser - generated ion beams unless appropriate optics and monochromatizing systems are developed .",
    "because of their high divergence , one needs very strong fields to collimate the ion beams .",
    "such fields exist only in plasma .",
    "however , one can not exploit the standard technique of self - induced magnetic plasma lensing that is widely used to focus conventionally accelerated ion beams .",
    "the reason is that the laser - produced ion beams are charge neutral , i.e. they contain electrons that compensate the ion charge and current .",
    ", the length @xmath1 and is located at the distance @xmath2 from the foil .",
    "the radial electric field of the plasma inside the cylinder collimates the ion beam.,width=302 ]    in the present work we consider ion beam focusing by plasma which already contains a quasistatic electric field .",
    "the experimental configuration is the following , fig .",
    "[ fig : lens ] , @xcite : a laser produced ion beam originates at the point @xmath3 , @xmath4 and propagates toward a hollow metal cylinder of the radius @xmath5 and length @xmath1 , @xmath6 .",
    "the axis of the cylinder coincides with the @xmath7-axis . at the same time , the second laser pulse is shot at the cylinder .",
    "this second pulse generates a population of hot electrons , which penetrate through the metal and spread very fast over the inner surface of the cylinder .",
    "they exit into vacuum and generate a cloud of space charge at the inner surface .",
    "the electric field of this space charge is large enough to ionize the material and to create plasma . as a result at the initial moment we have a cylindrical plasma layer with high electron temperature @xmath0 and low ion temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the plasma begins to expand toward the cylinder axis due to the tnsa ( target normal sheath acceleration ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "normally , the cylinder surface is covered by a thin layer of hydrogen - rich substances .",
    "being the lightest ions , protons are accelerated first and the plasma is usually an electron - proton one regardless of the particular chemical mixture of the cylinder itself .",
    "plasma dynamics is described by the couple of vlasov s equations for electrons and ions and the maxwell equations    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron and ion distribution functions respectively .",
    "we do not include magnetic field in ( [ vlasov ] ) since the cylindrical symmetry of the expansion prohibits magnetic fields generation .    the initial conditions for eqs .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) are    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are initial distributions of electrons and ions , @xmath15 and @xmath5 are cylinder thickness and radius respectively , @xmath16 .",
    "for the initial distributions one reads    @xmath17    where the cylinder length @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the average electron density .",
    "the multiplier @xmath20 is due to the condition of plasma charge neutrality .    in the following",
    "we consider the case of relativistic electron temperatures and non - relativistic ions : @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we exploit the ultrarelativistic approximation @xmath22 for the electron velocities , while for the ions we get @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the ion and electron masses respectively .",
    "we introduce new dimensionless variables    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the ion sound velocity .",
    "since the electrons are ultra - relativistic and ions are non - relativistic , we are forced to introduce different dimensionless normalization for electron and ion components :    @xmath28    we rewrite the vlasov equations ( [ vlasov ] ) in these variables :    @xmath29    the normalized vlasov - maxwell equations ( [ vlasovdimensionless ] ) reveal that the the system dynamics depend on five dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first parameter is the ion charge @xmath30 .",
    "the next two parameters are the normalized sound speed @xmath31 and the normalized debye length @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "these two parameters define plasma dynamic properties .",
    "the remaining two parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 come from the initial system geometry .",
    "we are interested in the cylindrical geometry and drop out the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the parametric dependencies can be written as :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are universal functions .",
    "( [ dimensionlessfunctions ] ) already can be used to state exact scaling laws . the requirements @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "do not fix all the dimensional parameters of the problem , and this allows to scale experimental results .",
    "yet , the most interesting scalings are obtained in the limit @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "assuming @xmath45 one obtains    @xmath46    this means that the electron distribution function can be written as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a universal function .",
    "( [ equilibrium2 ] ) means that the electron fluid has the same effective temperature at all points .",
    "the formal limit @xmath49 coincides with the quasineutrality condition    @xmath50    since @xmath51 is a factor in front of the highest derivative in ( [ vlasovdimensionless ] ) , the quasinetrality condition ( [ quasineutrality ] ) is violated within the narrow debye sheath layer of the width @xmath52 .",
    "being very important for problems like ion acceleration this area hardly plays any role in the ion focusing .",
    "because of its narrowness , only the small amount of ion beam on the order of @xmath53 would be influenced by its fields at any particular moment .",
    "we neglect this influence .",
    "in order to describe the focusing , we study properties of the quasineutral part of the expanding plasma cloud .",
    "the quasineutrality @xmath54 is guaranteed as long as @xmath55 . here @xmath19 and @xmath56 are the electron and ion densities , @xmath30 is the ion charge state . at the same time , the plasma density and consequently the electron pressure @xmath57 vary along the cylinder radius .",
    "the pressure gradient is counterbalanced by the radial electric field    @xmath58    which is developed inside the plasma to satisfy the quasineutrality ( [ quasineutrality ] ) . because the electron pressure gradient is directed off axis ,",
    "the developed electric field is directed toward the cylinder axis .",
    "it is this field that focuses the injected ions .",
    "because of the cylindrical symmetry , we neglect any dependencies on the azimuthal angle on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath7 within the plasma . then , all distributions depend on the radius @xmath59 only . to obtain a closed system of equations we take into account the energy conservation law    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the number of hot electrons and @xmath62 is the laser energy absorbed in the cylinder and stored in the hot electrons .",
    "( [ energyconservation ] ) neglects the energy accumulated in the electromagnetic plasma fields .",
    "this assumption is correct provided that the debye length is much smaller than the cylinder radius @xmath5 , i.e. for @xmath63 .",
    "( [ equilibrium1 ] ) and ( [ equilibrium2 ] ) show that the electron temperature is equal at all points of the plasma .",
    "thus , the energy conservation law ( [ energyconservation ] ) is sufficient to describe the electron dynamics .",
    "the initial ion distribution is    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the initial surface density of ions participating in the plasma expansion . because of the quasineutrality condition ( [ quasineutrality ] ) , we have @xmath66 .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless time - dependent electron temperature @xmath67 and the ion velocity @xmath68 .    the ion vlasov equation and eqs .",
    "( [ balance])([energyconservation ] ) rewritten in the dimensionless variables take the form :    @xmath69    with the initial condition    @xmath70    eqs .",
    "( [ balanceuni])-([initialconditionuni ] ) contain no dimensional parameters whatsoever . as a consequence , the functions @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are universal , i.e.",
    ", they are not affected by specific values of @xmath15 , @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath65 and @xmath74 .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to develop a meaningful similarity theory describing the guidance of laser produced ion beams .    from the normalizations ( [ dimensionlessvariables ] ) we conclude that the electric field @xmath75 developed in the plasma is    @xmath76    where @xmath73 is a universal function .",
    "it does not depend on the plasma density , but is determined by the hot electron temperature and the cylinder geometry only .",
    "this result is valid as long as the debye length is much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the uncompensated charge density    @xmath77    is much smaller than the electron density .",
    "when the laser produced ion beam enters plasma inside the cylinder , it is deflected by the electric field ( [ electricfield ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the beam has a lower density than the plasma inside the cylinder and thus the beam own fields can be neglected .",
    "to describe the beam ion guiding in plasma we consider ions with the charge state @xmath78 , mass @xmath79 and the initial energy @xmath80 being focused by the potential    @xmath81    notice that the charge density @xmath82 depends on time .",
    "however , for the most interesting and important case the beam ions pass the cylinder plasma during the time @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the plasma evolution time . in this case the dependence of @xmath86 from time @xmath87 can be neglected .",
    "now we are able to estimate influence of the non - neutral debye sheath with the width @xmath88 on the beam ions motion .",
    "this area propagates with the velocity @xmath89 and carries the electric field @xmath90",
    ". the radial momentum of a beam ion is changed by the value    @xmath91    where @xmath92 .",
    "the change of a beam ion radial momentum due to the interaction with the quasineutral part of plasma is estimated as    @xmath93    where @xmath94 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ momentumchangenq ] ) and ( [ momentumchange ] ) one sees that @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the ions passing through the non - quasineutral edge are stronger deviated than those interacting only with the quasineutral plasma region . however , because the debye sheath is narrow , the relative number of the strongly declined ions is small and these ions are deviated to different points of space . for these reasons",
    "the debye sheath at the edge of the expanding plasma does not contribute to the ion focusing .",
    "it scatters the beam ion instead .",
    "to investigate focusing properties of the potential @xmath96 we use the well known analogy between the geometrical optics and the classical mechanics .",
    "the optical length corresponds to the action @xmath97 in the hamilton - jacoby equation @xcite    @xmath98    if ions in vacuum are injected at the point @xmath4 , @xmath99 then the @xmath97 function in vacuum is    @xmath100    in our geometry , @xmath101 .",
    "if ions are focused at the point @xmath4 , @xmath102 in vacuum , then the action @xmath97 is    @xmath103    the beam ion motion inside the plasma cylinder is described by the hamiltonian    @xmath104    the solution of the hamilton - jacoby equation inside the plasma can be expanded as    @xmath105    where the function @xmath106 is    @xmath107    note that when the electrons pull the ions behind themselves ( positive pressure gradient ) there is an electron excess at the axis @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "the constant @xmath109 in ( [ betafunction ] ) is obtained from the continuity conditions of the action @xmath97 at the front and rear sides of the plasma cylinder .",
    "thus , we arrive at the thick lens formula    @xmath110    where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and    @xmath114    in our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ thicklense ] ) we neglected the change of plasma parameters during the time the beam ions need to pass the cylinder .",
    "this means that our analysis is valid if @xmath115 .",
    "a parallel beam of ions is obtained if @xmath116 .",
    "this condition is satisfied for @xmath117 if    @xmath118    thus , the plasma element collimates ions with the energy    @xmath119    it is worth mentioning that the energy of the collimated ions strongly depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath120 and can be significantly larger than the initial electron temperature .",
    "it is easy to see that for the ion focusing be practical the electron temperature @xmath0 has to be of the order of several mevs .",
    "such electron temperatures are routinely produced by multi - terawatt lasers .",
    "would be the plasma inside the cylinder stationary , then only ions with the selected energy ( [ collimation ] ) are collimated .",
    "however , the plasma is non - stationary with the characteristic evolution time @xmath121 . the relative change of the plasma parameters during the ion passage time through the cylinder is of the order of @xmath122 .",
    "this small parameter defines finally the finite energy spectrum width @xmath123 of the focused ions :    @xmath124    it follows from ( [ widthenergy ] ) that the plasma cylinder works as a good monochromator if @xmath125 .    to avoid any confusion",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ widthenergy ] ) describes the quality of a small aperture ion beam only .",
    "of course , different parts of the lens collimate ions of different energies . for large",
    "aperture ion beams the energy spectrum width of the focused ions will be large , @xmath126 .    in the preceding part of the paper we consider the focusing by the area @xmath127 .",
    "it is important that the theory can easily be generalised for the focusing by the cylindric area near @xmath128 .",
    "to do so we introduce a new potential    @xmath129    according to eq .",
    "( [ electricfield ] ) the potential @xmath130 gives the right value of the electric field at @xmath131 .",
    "thus the focusing by @xmath131 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ thicklense ] ) with @xmath132 by the substitution @xmath133 .",
    "until now we have assumed that the density of the ion beam focused is so small that it does not affect the focusing field of the lens . to find the validity condition for this approach we have to consider the propagating of an ion beam with a given density profile @xmath134 through the lens . using the quasuneutrality condition for the system",
    "`` the lens plasma + the beam '' one can easily find the the focusing by the area around @xmath131 is not disturbed by the ion beam if    @xmath135 .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a closed similarity theory of a hollow cylinder as a plasma element for ion beam guiding .",
    "significantly , the beam ions are focused by the quasinuetral part of expanding plasma rather than by strong electric fields in the non - quasineutral leading edge of the expanding plasma cloud .",
    "the thick lens formula has been obtained with explicit scalings for all of the parameters .",
    "we show that the plasma lens collimates only ions with a quite definite energy and may be used for monochromatization of the laser - produced ion beams .",
