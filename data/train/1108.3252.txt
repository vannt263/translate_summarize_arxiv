    "in ferromagnet nanowires , the deviation of magnetization from the ground state results in the excitation of spin waves .",

    "the dynamics of magnetization in a soliton can be well described by the famous landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite .",
    "the topological soliton , now namely domain wall ( dw ) , connecting two vacua describes an inhomogeneous state of magnetization and it can not be reduced to the ground state by any finite deformation @xcite .",
    "so it has technological application in race track memory @xcite .",
    "the field - driven dw motion has been studied extensively in thin films @xcite and recently in magnetic nanowires @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the dw travelling speed in magnetic materials conventionally depends on the strength of a constant magnetic field as the external filed is below the walker - breakdown value @xcite . above this critical value ,",
    "the dw develops a variational complex internal structure which results in temporal oscillation of dw velocity @xcite .",
    "recently , many studies demonstrate that the spin - polarized current can cause many unique phenomena for magnetization motion , which attributes to spin - transfer effect @xcite . with this consideration the modified landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xcite including",

    ", considerable progresses have been made to understand the current - induced dw motion in magnetic nanowires @xcite .",
    "this current induced magnetization motion possesses of different character from that driven by an magnetic field , and the spin - transfer torque can induce not only precession but also damping role for the motion of magnetization .    on the other hand",
    ", the dynamic soliton describes the localized states of magnetization which can be reduced to a uniform magnetization by continuous deformation , so that the excited ferromagnet makes a transition to the ground state .",
    "therefore , a dynamic soliton is sometimes said to be topologically equivalent to the ground state . also , the motion of dynamic soliton is of topic research in confined ferromagnetic materials @xcite , especially with the generation and detection of magnons excitation @xcite in a magnetic multilayer .",
    "driven by the adiabatic spin - transfer torque , the dynamic soliton solutions for isotropic case @xcite and uniaxial anisotropic case @xcite are investigated carefully , where the corresponding solutions show the characteristic breather behavior for magnetization motion in ferromagnetic nanowire . however , the current driven motion of the dynamic soliton are not well explored carefully .    in this paper , we present the generation of a novel _ magnetic rouge wave _ solution under stronger breather characters in a perpendicular anisotropic ferromagnetic nanowire driven by spin - transfer torque , which is similar to optical rouge wave in fiber @xcite .",
