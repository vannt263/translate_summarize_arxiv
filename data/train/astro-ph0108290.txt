    "in paper  i of this series ( hambly et al .",
    "2001a ) we describe the supercosmos sky survey programme ( hereafter sss ) .",
    "this project is to scan the multi ",
    "colour / multi  epoch schmidt photographic atlas material to produce a digitised survey of the sky in three colours ( bri ) , one colour ( r ) at two epochs .",
    "the ultimate aim of the project is to cover the entire sky ; the first release of data from the programme was the south galactic cap ( hereafter sgc ) survey .",
    "the sgc survey covers @xmath14 square degrees of the southern sky at galactic latitudes @xmath15 .",
    "paper  iii in this series describes the derivation of the astrometric parameters for the sss ( hambly et al .",
    "2001b ) . in this , the second paper of the series , we describe in some detail the image detection , parameterisation and classification procedures for the programme .",
    "we also describe the techniques for photometric calibration .",
    "paper  i is intended as a user guide for the survey data .",
    "it describes the database organisation and demonstrates specific examples of the use of the data .",
    "papers  ii and  iii provide technical details concerning the derivation of object catalogue parameters available from the survey database , and also demonstrate the precision of these with respect to external data from other sources . in these papers , we demonstrate examples and make comparisons using data from the sgc survey .",
    "all the results , however , are generally applicable to the sss data as a whole at galactic latitudes @xmath16 . at lower latitudes",
    ", image crowding will of course degrade astrometric and photometric performance .",
    "the plate material used in the sss is detailed in paper  i , and consists of sky  limited schmidt photographic glass plate and film originals , or glass copies of glass originals , taken with the uk , eso and palomar oschin schmidt telescopes ( for more details see morgan et al .",
    "1992 and references therein ) .",
    "hereafter , the serc ",
    "j / ej survey will be refered to simply as the j  survey ; the aao ",
    "r / serc  er as the r  survey and the serc  i as the i  survey .",
    "the supercosmos machine digitises the scanned photograph at 10@xmath17 m resolution ( 0.67  arcsec ) in 15bit grey levels ( further details of the hardware are given in hambly et al .",
    "pixel values are in transmission units and are related to incident intensity via the usual transmission ( @xmath18 ) , density ( @xmath19 ) and intensity ( @xmath20 ) relationships on the the log  linear part of the photographic characteristic curve : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gradient of the response in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "each photograph is digitised in @xmath24  hr , producing @xmath24  gbyte of data .",
    "the pixel map is ` blocked down ' in @xmath25 pixel cells during scanning to produce a raw median sky map ; all subsequent processing is then carried out offline .",
    "object detection in the raw pixel map requires an estimate of the sky value at every point within the two  dimensional image .",
    "the raw median values of the sky are first filtered using a weighted median filter ( brownrigg  1984 ) of the form @xmath26 applied over filtering scales of 3,2 and  1 blocks ( e.g.  stobie  1986 ) .",
    "this results in variations in scale size greater than @xmath24  mm ( or @xmath24  arcmin ) being retained as sky variations in the background array .",
    "this is obviously a compromise between detection of low surface brightness objects at this scale or greater and accurate image parameterisation in areas of real sky variation .",
    "experiments with differing scale lengths showed that the choice of raw blocking of 0.64  mm squares coupled with iterative filtering scale sizes of  3,2 and  1 ( e.g.  stobie  1986 ) is optimal in terms of minimising spurious detections due to , for example , low level scattered light around bright stars ( see also macgillivray & stobie  1984 ) .",
    "most modern schmidt photographs have one or more intensity calibration ` step  wedges ' exposed on their sides or corners ( see , for example , tritton  1983 ) . in principle , it is possible to measure the transmission of the various intensity spots and calibrate measured transmission into incident relative intensity . in practice , however , there are a number of reasons why even rough step ",
    "wedge calibration is difficult to achieve .",
    "variations in emulsion sensitivity across the plate and non  uniform illumination of the wedge spots themselves can cause large errors .",
    "also , the fact that supercosmos scans by illumination of a strip of emulsion means that when imaging dense spots , the light levels recorded are badly affected by diffracted light originating from relatively clear emulsion surrounding the spot . measurements of the 16spot kpno step wedges on modern ukstu plates using a macbeth diffuse densitometer show values of characteristic curve gradient @xmath27% ( indeed , such a value is a criterion for a survey  grade plate and inclusion in the final ukstu photographic sky atlases ) .",
    "hence , we use an _ assumed _ transmission  to  intensity calibration with slope corresponding to @xmath28 ( older glass copies of the poss  i ` e ' survey are analysed using a different value due to their poorer contrast ) .",
    "this procedure is vindicated not least by the demonstration , in section  [ grads ] , of measurements of the gradients of the instrumental magnitude scale with respect to ccd data , where we show that the resulting scales have close to unit gradient with scatter at around the 10% level .",
    "image detection requires thresholding above a local sky estimate .",
    "the sss pixel data are thresholded at a constant percentage cut above local sky .",
    "a sky noise parameter @xmath29 is determined from a small ( @xmath30  arcmin ) region of image data near the centre of each plate .",
    "the sky background value i@xmath31 in this region is determined as described in beard , macgillivray & thanisch  ( 1990 ) while the @xmath29 estimator uses the relationship @xmath32 , where mad@xmath31 is the median of absolute deviations of the pixel values about the sky estimate ( the factor 1.48 is the scaling needed to convert the mad estimate for a gaussian distribution to the equivalent gaussian sigma ) .",
    "this yields a ` percentage cut ' value pcut ( @xmath33 ) such that at any part of the image @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the threshold intensity , @xmath36 is the local sky estimate based on bilinear interpolation of the filtered sky map , and pcut is typically 7% for survey plates .",
    "note that this single ",
    "parameter multiplicative thresholding is designed to cope with the fact that the sky level ( and therefore the noise level ) changes over the schmidt field due to vignetting , and a zeropoint sky intensity value is chosen for the transmission  to  intensity calibration such that the threshold , in terms of the number of @xmath37 above sky , remains constant regardless of sky variations .",
    "once the thresholded pixel set has been determined for a plate , pixel connectivity can be analysed and image parameterisation can take place .",
    "the details of the cosmos pixel analyser are contained in macgillivray & stobie  ( 1984 ) , stobie  ( 1986 ) and beard et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and will not be repeated here ; however we describe some details that are relevant to supercosmos survey data .",
    "many of the techniques used are similar to those developed for the apm machine ( e.g.  irwin  1985 ; draper & eaton  1999 ) .    for image detection , 8fold nearest  neighbour pixel connectivity is used along with a criterion that images must contain at least  8 connected pixels ( the so  called ` area cut ' ) .",
    "rethresholding at 16 levels defined as in beard et al .  ( 1990 ) equation  2 , with a ` deblend parameter ' of d@xmath38 detects multiple objects via fragmentation ; in addition rethresholding at 8 levels defined by @xmath39 is used to supply a set of 8 ` areal profiles ' at intensity levels of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43  above the zeroth areal profile level @xmath35 .",
    "these provide a set of measurements of the areal extent ( in pixels ) of each image , and can be used for morphological classification ( see section  [ class ] ) .",
    "note that these areal profile levels are different to those originally used for the cosmos machine ( macgillivray & stobie  1984 ) .",
    "this new definition provides optimal levels for stellar profile analysis ( see later ) .",
    "object parameterisation proceeds for each detected object as described in stobie  ( 1986 ) , with both unit  weighted and intensity  weighted parameters being calculated and recorded .",
    "the object catalogue produced for each plate consists of an unformatted binary file ( the image analysis mode , or iam , file ) of record length 128  bytes consisting of 32 4byte parameters per object ; depending on galactic latitude and plate depth , this individual plate catalogue can have anything from  @xmath44 to  @xmath45 entries .",
    "table  [ iam ] details the full 32 parameter set available for each image .",
    "note that parameters 1,2,19,20,31 and  32 and some bits in parameter  30 are derived at a second stage of processing ( known colloquially as ` post processing '  see section  [ pp ] )    lllll no .",

    "however , the following gives further details of some of the more esoteric parameters :    * cosmag ( parameter  9 ) is calculated from the sky  subtracted intensity values in the connected pixels comprising an image , @xmath49 and is given in units of millimags .",
    "cosmag is an isophotal magnitude . *",
    "blend : each image is deblended by rethresholding at the levels defined by equation  2 , beard et al .  ( 1990 ) ; at each level , the connected pixels are examined for fragmentation and pixels are assigned to fragments using the algorithm described therein .",
    "images which have been deblended have this indicated in the deblending flag .",
    "a code of @xmath50 means the image is the parent image of @xmath51 components , while a code of @xmath52 means that the image is the @xmath53 deblended component ( or child image ) of a parent image .",
    "both parents and children are retained in the iam datasets of each plate in the sss . * quality is an integer flag of 32 bits that are used to record situations encountered during the analysis of the pixels comprising an image .",
    "bits are set in such a way that increasingly severe conditions are flagged by setting increasingly significant bits in the quality flag .",
    "table  [ qbits ] gives more information ; other bits in the quality flag are either used only for image analysis software debugging or are totally unused .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]      the post  processing of each field consists of a number of separate tasks that either overwrite information into the individual plate catalogue files , or that write separate files of data or coefficients .",
    "paper  i describes the sss database organisation and the system that is used to associate individual plate files into a seamless whole . here",
    ", we describe the post  processing tasks that operate on each plate datafile to produce astrometric , photometric and image quality / class information .",
    "paper  iii describes the derivation of global astrometric solutions for each plate .",
    "iam parameters 11,12 and  18 ( respectively @xmath54 , @xmath55 and ellipse  fit position angle with respect to the @xmath54 axis ) are transformed into celestial co - ordinates and a celestial position angle which are written to iam parameters 1,2 and  20 respectively .",
    "proper motion information is also derived between j / r plate pairs and held in separate files , as described in paper  iii .",
    "two additional bits in the quality flag that are unused by the image analysis software are derived at the post  processing stage .",
    "firstly , bit  7 is used to flag images that are in parts of the plate that are likely to be affected by the presence of step  wedges and labels .",
    "areas of the plate are flagged in this way based on the number and the telescope origin of the plate . for example , all uk schmidt plates have a 7step wedge in the west of their northern edge ; in addition plate numbers 1 through to 5715 have a 7step wedge on their eastern edge ; plate numbers 5716 through to 6295 have a 16step kpno wedge in the same eastern position of the 7step wedge while all plates numbered from 6296 have a 16spot kpno wedge in their south  eastern corner .",
    "the survey plate sets used have been examined for wedges and labels , and all images in the appropriate areas have bit  7 set to indicate possible spurious nature or probable poorly determined parameters in the case of real images . because the modern survey field centres are spaced to provide @xmath56 overlap regions between adjacent plates , all parts of the sky affected by a wedge or label on one plate will be unaffected on one or other of the adjacent plates , so these flags are used when creating ` seamless ' catalogues across plate overlap boundaries when making a decision as to which image to include out of a set of duplicates ( see paper  i ) .",
    "secondly , possible problems with an image due to the proximity of a very bright star are indicated using bit  10 .",
    "tritton  ( 1983 ) describes in some detail the origin and appearance of various image defects around bright stars on sky  limited uk schmidt plates .",
    "while the background following algorithm is tuned to minimse spurious image detections around bright stars , there are inevitably many false detections due to , for example , diffraction spikes . within the sgc survey ,",
    "10 plates from each survey colour were examined by eye to measure an exclusion radius , as a function of magnitude , around bright stars . in figure  [ radfit ]",
    "we show these measurements and the log  linear fit as a function of magnitude that is used to flag images as potentially spurious .",
    "we have been conservative in this procedure in the sense that we have flagged all images that could _ possibly _ be spurious , including of course some real images .",
    "hence , if a relatively uncontaminated ( but incomplete ) catalogue is required to be extracted from the survey data , this quality bit can be tested .",
    "the flagging procedure is completely automatic : given the fit as a function of magnitude and a brightness threshold above which to apply it , a list of bright stars is extracted from each iam dataset and a record kept of the magnitude and radius for flagging .",
    "these lists are recorded for each field and can be used for estimating spatial sampling completeness when employing this flag .",
    "( 150,90 )      the sss data are image classified using a two  stage classification scheme originally developed for apm data ( e.g.  irwin & mcmahon 1992 ) .",
    "the first classification stage makes use of conventional techniques such as surface brightness and image shape ( cf .",
    "heydon  dumbleton , collins & macgillivray  1989 ; macgillivray & stobie  1984 ) .",
    "the second stage uses a series of image parameters to trace the stellar locus in a multidimensional parameter space and then quantify the similarity , or otherwise , of an individual image with respect to stellar objects of the same intensity .",
    "advantages of this second stage include : the generation of a ` linearised ' instrumental magnitude scale ( see later ) ; the ability to incorporate prior knowledge of the expected fraction of different classes of images ; and a stellarness index in addition to the more usual discrete classification flag ( stellar / non  stellar / noise ) . the stellarness index quantifies how well the parameters of a given image match the stellar template for that intensity .",
    "for ease of use , the index is given in terms of the equivalent normalised gaussian distribution , of zero - mean and unit - variance  ie .",
    "an n(0,1 ) statistic .",
    "the first stage of image classification consists of generating scatter plots using a combination of measures of the image magnitudes , surface brightness and peak brightness versus magnitude and automatically locating the stellar locus in each .",
    "the stellar locii are automatically found by converting each scatter plot into a 128 @xmath57 128 two - dimensional map , where each `` pixel '' repesents the number of points lying in that bin .",
    "obvious noise - like objects , for example with ellipticity @xmath580.9 or with areal profile slopes incompatible with real images , are not included in the two - dimensional count ( but are shown in the the scatter plots ) .",
    "the location of the mode , and scatter about the modal value , are then determined , where possible , for each magnitude / peak slice and used to track the stellar locus and spread in stellar locus . for faint magntiudes where the stellar locus blends in with the remaining object locii ,",
    "the centre - of - gravity of the generic distribution is used instead .",
    "figures  [ stats](a ) to  ( c ) show typical examples of these scatter plots , where the solid lines mark the boundaries of the stellar / non - stellar locus  defined to be @xmath42 away from the mode , where the mode is well measured , or defined as the centre of gravity of the distribution for the faint end .",
    "the isophotal area versus magnitude diagram is additionally used to define a stellar / noise image boundary which is further used to flag images not to consider in the other two plots . after some experimentation , a combination of the three scatter plots shown in figures  [ stats ] was found to give a reliable stage-1 classification over a wide range of magnitudes , galactic location and plate / emulsion combinations .",
    "the final stage  1 classification is based on a combination of the signed sigma - normalised distances from the stellar locii from these three plots plus the image ellipticity information . as noted previously , at this stage",
    "the stellar / non  stellar boundary is set to conservatively class objects as stellar by defining a @xmath42 boundary from the median stellar locus . in a final step",
    ", obvious non - stellar objects in the stellar bin are rebadged by checking for consistency of other parameters such as ellipticity and areal profile slope .",
    "( 150,220 )    at the completion of the first stage of image classification , each image has iam parameter  19 overwritten by a classification code in the range  1 to  4 where 1=non  stellar , 2=stellar , 3=unclassifiable and 4=noise ( i.e.  images lying above the upper locus in figure  [ stats]a . )",
    "the provisional classification from stage  1 is then used as the primary input for the stage  2 classification scheme outlined earlier .",
    "this second phase builds upon the classification already developed by using it as the basis for deriving a more general descriptor of image shape .",
    "providing the stage  1 stellar sample is a fair representation of the total stellar population , and only has modest contamination by non - stellar images , it is feasible to use it as a means to automatically track the stellar locus for any combination of the measured supercosmos image parameters .    automatically deriving both the position and spread in the stellar locus as a function of magnitude , for any of the image shape parameters is straightforward , even with modest amounts of non - stellar object contamination , providing robust estimation techniques are used ( e.g.  hoaglin , mosteller & tukey 1983 ) . for any desired image shape descriptor , the location of the median of the population suffices to define the locus as a function of magnitude , while the median of the absolute deviation from the median ( mad ) provides a good measure of the scatter about this locus .",
    "the mad estimate of scatter can then be converted to the equivalent gaussian sigma by noting , as before , that @xmath59 . by this",
    "means each of the individual image shape descriptors can be renormalised to follow a zero - median , unit - variance gaussian - like n(0,1 ) distribution .",
    "another part of the second stage of image classification consists of an iterative determination of the stellar radial profile ( ie .",
    "the stellar point spread function , psf , for the plate ) and the determination of a linear instrumental magnitude scale .",
    "this follows the procedure described by bunclark & irwin  ( 1983 ) and makes use of the fact that , to a good approximation , all stellar images should have the same intrinsic profile shape whatever their magnitude .",
    "the areal profile measures ( equation  [ areal ] ) form the basis for this estimate , using the preset instrumental profile threshold levels as a first guess for the intensity scale .",
    "figure  [ apmcal ] shows the results of a typical profile determination and linearised transfer function between isophotal and profile magnitude for a survey plate .",
    "the resulting stellar psf can then also be used as part of the classification scheme .    in order to make an optimal judgement about the class of an object",
    ", a traditional bayesian classification scheme uses knowledge of the conditional and prior probabilities on the right hand side of the following equation @xmath60 where the probability , or likelihood , of observing the image descriptors for stars , galaxies and noise are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively ; @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective prior probabilities of finding a star , galaxy or noise image ; and @xmath67 is the posterior probability of the image being a star . in a similar way we can write equations for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the posterior probability of the image being a galaxy or noise object .",
    "unfortunately , the distribution of both galaxy and noise image parameters is in general unknown , implying that we can not directly use a bayesian estimator in this case .",
    "the problem is further compounded by the fact that the real likelihood function for stellar images is also non - trivial to estimate .",
    "this is caused by the underlying error distribution of the parameters being non - gaussian in the real world and also because the image parameters are highly correlated , with the degree of correlation varying significantly as a function of magnitude .",
    "however , deriving the stellar psf as part of the internal intensity calibration helps to significantly reduce the number of free parameters required to accurately describe the shape of an object .",
    "each image has ( up to ) 8 parameters measuring the areal profile which can be readily converted into the equivalent radial profile .",
    "clearly , images with derived radial profiles significantly steeper than the stellar psf are more likely to be noise images , while those with derived profiles much shallower than the stellar psf are more likey to be galaxies . after some experimentation we found that the intensity - normalised slope of the sigma - weighted difference between an image radial profile and the stellar psf provided a way of summarising the stellarness of an image using all the areal profile information .",
    "this measure preserves both the ` sign ' of the deviation and quantifies the difference .",
    "the normalised - slope measure is then combined additively with ( the relatively ) independent information derived from the intensity - weighted second moments and peak intensity to produce a single number measure . finally , as a function of magnitude , all objects previously classified as stellar , are used to convert the stellarness index back to a zero - median unit - variance n(0,1 ) score .",
    "this stellarness index is our pragmatic equivalent of the likelihood function of the data and summaries the probability that the observed data arose from a stellar object .",
    "a typical example of the derived stellarness index for a survey plate is shown in figure  [ reclass ] with the primary stellar locus boundaries adopted ( @xmath70 for star / galaxy and @xmath71 star / noise ) . as a further refinement this average value of the stellarness index as a function of plate position",
    "is tabulated and used to remove small variations in the zero - point of the stellar locus caused by field effects .",
    "returning to the idealised bayesian scheme outlined previously , for star / galaxy separation the main quantity of interest is @xmath72 since when this ratio is greater than unity the object is classified as a star , and when less than unity as a galaxy .",
    "although the underlying distribution , @xmath62 , is unknown , we do know that both galaxy and noise images have a much wider spread of image shape descriptors than stars , hence to a reasonable approximation @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; where @xmath75 denotes uniform distribution and the arguments the range over which it applies  which in general are a function of magnitude . in the absence of prior information",
    "the ratio of @xmath76 , if @xmath77 and one end of the range @xmath78 lies within the normal stellar distribution , is exactly equivalent to specifying a one - sided k - sigma boundary separating stars from galaxies .",
    "the prior information only enters via the ratio of the expected numbers of star : to : galaxies at a particular magnitude . for most survey fields ( i.e.  not the galactic plane ) the total number of stellar images and the total number of galaxy images visible on a survey plate",
    "are roughly equal . as a function of magnitude ,",
    "however , the stellar population varies roughly as @xmath79 while the number of galaxy images varies as @xmath80 . using the equality of total numbers of star and galaxies near the plate limit to define the relative normalising constant ,",
    "automatically specifies the ratio @xmath81 for all magnitudes .",
    "this prior information ratio can then readily be incorporated into the previous boundary definition by defining a new k-sigma boundary using the assumed n(0,1 ) distribution of the likelihood function to convert ratios to sigmas .    although inevitably somewhat adhoc , this scheme does allow us to fold in additional information within the framework of a bayesian approach ( e.g.  prior knowledge of star : to : galaxy ratios and the knowledge that galaxies and noise images have a wide range of image shapes ) .",
    "the advantages of decision making directly in k - sigma space are that it is straightforward to place realistic constraints on the influence of the prior knowledge , i.e.  by limiting how much the boundary can shift , and it also mitigates against the effect of non - gaussian errors by automatically scaling the boundary using a robust sigma estimator .",
    "( 150,90 )    ( 150,90 )      the isophotal instrumental magnitude scale for iam data is non  linear with respect to external apparent magnitude .",
    "non  linearities are introduced by , for example , thresholding and the limited dynamic range of the measuring machine in addition to any non  linearities inherent in the photographic characteristic curve with respect to the linear @xmath82 scale assumed .",
    "additionally , the magnitude scale for galaxies will be , in general , different to that of stars .",
    "the reason for this is that galaxies are generally more extended and of lower surface brightness than stars , and as such have integrated magnitudes that are less susceptible to any dynamic range limit during measurement .",
    "moreover , the linearised profile magnitude for stars is easier to calibrate than the isophotal scale when external calibration data are limited since it is better behaved .",
    "note that the profile magnitude for a non ",
    "stellar object is not useful since such objects have , of course , non  stellar profiles . for these reasons ,",
    "the stellar / non  stellar magnitude calibrations for the survey data are treated separately .",
    "the calibration procedure adopted was as follows :      for each of the survey colours ( e.g.  serc ",
    "r ) the gradient of the faintest 7  mag of the profile magnitude scale was measured against ccd data from boyle , shanks & croom  ( 1995 ) and croom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . throughout this paper , where any comparisons have been done between photographic and photoelectric photometry , colour equations from blair & gilmore  ( 1982 ) , bessell  ( 1986 ) and evans  ( 1989 ) have been used to naturalise the magnitudes to the photographic b@xmath1/r@xmath83/r@xmath84/e@xmath85/i@xmath86 systems .",

    "furthermore , the small scatter in the gradients means that rough calibration to the plate limit is possible on a field  by  field basis using a small number of relatively bright standards in each field to define a bright stellar calibration curve that can be extrapolated to the plate limits .",
    "figure  [ gradmeas ] shows a typical example of a deep photometric sequence plotted against the linearised profile magnitude scale , demonstrating how closely linear the profile scale is over many magnitudes above the plate limit .",
    "contrast this with the same plotted for the isophotal scale , which is non  linear at the 0.5  mag level .",
    "( 150,90 )      in order to roughly calibrate the stellar profile magnitude scale of each field with respect to external standards , a compilation of bv photometry over the whole sky was made by combining the tycho catalogue ( esa  1997 ) and the guide star photometric catalogue  i ( lasker et al .  1988 ) .",
    "this provided two colour photometry down to v  @xmath96 in every survey field .",
    "standard magnitudes in the ri bands have been estimated from relationships between ( b  v ) versus ( v  r ) and ( v  i ) derived from the multicolour standard star data of landolt  ( 1992 ) . for each field ,",
    "a calibration curve of the profile instrumental magnitude versus naturalised standard magnitude was derived .",
    "figure  [ ccurve ] shows a typical example for the survey data .",
    "the solid lines are least  squares fits to the data , with the added linear constraints that at a fixed point 3  mag fainter than the the faintest calibrating standard , the gradient is set at the appropriate mean value given in table  [ gradients ] while the second derivative of the fitting function is set to zero . in this way",
    ", the calibrating function can be linearly extrapolated from this point to the plate limit , and the calibrating function has no discontinuities in itself or its first derivative .",
    "this somewhat complicated procedure is an attempt to realistically model the shape of the ` linearised ' stellar profile magnitude scale , which is indeed linear over its faintest 7  mag range ( e.g.  figure  [ gradmeas ] ) , but which departs from linearity brighter than this due to the fundamental dynamic range limits of the machine as dictated by diffraction ",
    "limited performance in the imaging optics and the transmission digitisation range , along with the dynamic range limit of the photographs themselves .",
    "( 150,90 )    the fact that the calibrations are extrapolated for the fainter magnitude range coupled with the paucity of external calibrating stars on the linear part of the profile scale results in small ( 10% to  20% ) errors in the zeropoint of the faint magnitude calibration of each field .",
    "this problem is dealt with in the next section .",
    "all the schmidt surveys have varying degrees of overlap between adjacent fields . for the poss ",
    "i e and eso ",
    "r surveys , this overlap can be very small ( or non - existent in the case of a few adjacent eso ",
    "r fields ) , but for the uk  schmidt surveys the field centres were chosen to give @xmath56 overlap strips for all fields ( this system of field centres , reflected into the northern hemisphere , has been adopted for the poss  ii survey ) .",
    "these overlap regions can be used to define a set of individual field photometric zeropoints such that the mean difference over all stars between the stellar magnitudes from the two measurements available per star in any given overlap region is zero .",
    "consider any two adjacent fields  @xmath97 and  @xmath51 .",
    "the mean ( systematic ) difference between the stellar magnitudes in the overlap region is @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the unknown zeropoints .",
    "a mosaic of many fields gives a ( singular ) set of equations in the @xmath101 and @xmath102 values .",
    "such a set may be solved by singular value decomposition to yield minimal zeropoints that solve the set .",
    "however , we have used faint ccd photometry to externally fix as many zeropoints as possible over the survey region .",
    "this makes the equation set non  singular and yields a unique vector of zeropoints that are tied to an external system .",
    "this procedure is similar to that adopted by maddox , efstathiou & sutherland  ( 1990 ) for the apm galaxy survey except that we have _ not _ solved for the field  to  field differences in the gradients of the photometric scales .",
    "also , our sources of external ccd photometry included data from the guide star photometric catalogue  ii ( postman et al .",
    "1997 ) , boyle et al .",

( 1990 ) . at the time of writing , approximately 50% of all southern hemisphere fields have external ccd data defining their photometric zeropoint .",
    "the photometric calibration of photographic plates based on calibrating stars necessarily assumes that there exists a unique calibration curve that is applicable over the entire plate . in general , this is _ not _ the case .",
    "for example , graphs of external photoelectric magnitude versus internal linearised profile magnitude , as a function of plate position , show significant changes in gradient .",
    "one possible cause of this is that the response of the photographic emulsion is not uniform over the plate ",
    "i.e.  the characteristic curve of the emulsion is not constant .",
    "whatever the cause , the results are the same : systematic errors in photometry as a function of magnitude and position occur , and those errors manifest themselves most visibly when magnitudes are combined to generate colour indices .",
    "moreover , we have assumed a constant value of the gradient of the profile magnitude scale in any given passband , and as table  [ gradients ] shows there is a significant dispersion about the mean values adopted which adds to any systematic effects within a given plate .",
    "for example , figure  [ cmdbefore ] shows an  i versus ( r  i ) colour  magnitude diagram for survey field  758 .",
    "there is apparently a trend for brighter stars to get become bluer in this diagram , along with a significant increase in scatter about the modal colour for brighter magnitude ranges .",
    "these effects are both due to systematic errors in photometry as a function of magnitude and position .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ twocolbefore ] shows a stellar ( j  r ) versus  ( r  i ) two  colour diagram for a mosaic of 9  fields at the south galactic pole for the magnitude range @xmath103 .",
    "while the general trend of red objects being red in both colours is apparent , it is also true that stars having intermediate colours do not show a good correlation between ( j  r ) and  ( r  i ) .",
    "the scatter in figure  [ twocolbefore ] is rather large , and masks astrophysically useful information .",
    "( 80,130 )    ( 80,80 )    these problems have been documented in the past ( e.g.  hambly et al .",
    "1995 ; goldschmidt & miller  1998 and references therein ) . in the abscence of large ",
    "scale external calibration sequences , there is no option other than to use the stellar distributions themselves ( in colour , as a function of magnitude and position ) to measure the size of these effects and to calibrate them out .",
    "such corrections require that one passband is chosen as the standard with respect to which all other passbands are corrected . here , we have chosen the j  plates for this purpose because the most widely available external photometry is in the b  band and we expect that the rough calibrations ( section  [ rough ] ) will be the most accurate in this passband .",
    "the correction procedure is straightforward , and is applied to each set of r  and  i field data individually .",
    "first , shifts in colour as a function of position are measured by cross ",
    "correlating smoothed histograms of number  colour counts as a function of magnitude and plate position in coarse bins of 1  mag and 2  cm respectively .",
    "the resulting data cubes of shifts are then padded , resampled onto a @xmath104 finer grid and linearly filtered and smoothed to yield final shift values to be applied to the data .",
    "the final stage of the correction procedure consists of forming number  magnitude histograms as a function of magnitude only , in 0.1  mag bins , and finding the 10th percentile blue ` edge ' of the distributions .",
    "hence , a shift of this value with respect to a global value ( measured as the median 10th percentil blue edge of faint stars over all the fields in the survey ) is measured and can be applied to the data to shift and straighten the blue edge to an internally consistent position .",
    "table  [ blueshifts ] shows the values measured over the whole survey for anchoring the colours in this way .",
    "figures  [ cmdafter ] and  [ twocolafter ] show the results of this procedure for direct comparison with figures  [ cmdbefore ] and  [ twocolbefore ] .",

    "for example , differential reddening across a field would tend to be calibrated out by the above procedure .",
    "for this reason , the database access software ( paper  i ) allows the user the option of turning off these corrections at access time so that uncorrected colours are available if required .",
    "as mentioned previously , the galaxy magnitude calibration must be treated separately to that of stellar objects .",
    "the isophotal magnitude scale is tied to that of stellar objects using the faintest @xmath105 range of objects where the isophotal scale for stars and galaxies is the same since at these magnitudes , the majority of galaxies are unresolved on the plates and have the same profile shapes . in order to apply a simple linear fit between isophotal and profile magnitudes ,",
    "however , the isophotal scale must first be corrected for thresholding non  linearity ( the profile scale is , of course , linear over much more than the faintest @xmath105 range ) .",
    "the thresholding correction to the isophotal scale was modelled assuming a gaussian profile , @xmath106 from which integration yields @xmath107 where @xmath37=fwhm of the profile . if thresholding truncates the integrated brightness at a radius @xmath108 , then it is easy to show that @xmath109 where @xmath36 and pcut are defined by equation  [ threshold ] in section  [ thresholding ] .",
    "we also have that the difference between the total and isophotal integrated intensities of an object is given by @xmath110 and defining an isophotal correction @xmath111 such that @xmath112 it is straightforward to show that @xmath113 hence , a calibration of m@xmath114 versus the calibrated profile magnitude for the same image is possible , and is furthermore applicable to the full threshold corrected isophotal scale . note that @xmath111 is not a correction to ` total ' galaxy magnitudes ( e.g.  young et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) since such a correction is dependent on galaxy profile shape .",
    "note also that we calibrate m@xmath115 to provide a first  order correction for vignetting and differential desensitisation as a function of plate position ( e.g.  maddox et al .",
    "an example calibration of m@xmath114 versus calibrated profile magnitude is shown in figure  [ galcal ] . in this way a calibration for non ",
    "stellar objects is defined in every field , this calibration being tied to the same external zeropoints as the stellar magnitude scale .",
    "( 150,90 )    it is worth emphasising that the calibrations set up for the survey photometry take the form of coefficients values that are applied to raw measurements as and when the data are accessed ( see paper  i ) .",
    "this allows recalibration at any point in the future when better methods and/or better external calibration data become available .",
    "the raw , uncalibrated and uncorrected isophotal and profile instrumental magnitudes are also available , along with all morphological information produced during pixel analysis .",
    "this will allow , for example , investigation and implementation of more sophisticated galaxy calibration techniques in the future ( e.g.  young et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "when assessing the accuracy of the measurement , classification and calibration schemes detailed in the previous section , it is important to distinguish between the various types of error that it is possible to measure and quote .",
    "this is particularly important when comparing the sss characteristics against those of other survey programmes ( e.g.  paper  i ) . here",
    ", we have assessed the internal consistency of the survey data by comparison between data for the same objects from overlap regions ( i.e.  where two independent measurements of the same quantity are available ) . under the assumption that the two overlapping plates have the same characteristics of image quality and signal  to  noise ratio ,",
    "this also provides estimates of the random errors ( dividing by @xmath116 , where appropriate , for a single measurement ) .",
    "note that similar comparisons in overlap regions other than those specifically used here yield similar results provided they have galactic latitudes @xmath16 .",
    "as it will be shown in the next sections , the random errors in single colour photometry are dominated by position and magnitude dependent systematic errors for brighter magnitude ranges , and it is therefore useful to quote an apparent ` standard ' error in the presence of such effects , and also a relative error when comparing photometry within restricted magnitude and position ranges .",
    "the latter thus reflects the true , underlying random errors in the measurement process and is useful when the data are being used in isolation ( for example , inter  comparison of object magnitudes ) while the former is more appropriate when measurements are taken at face  value and compared with external data .",
    "note however that the calibration procedure removes systematic errors in colour as a function of magnitude and position _ and _ across the survey as a whole ( section  [ colbias ] ) so that the sss object colours ( e.g.  b@xmath1r , r ",
    "i ) are much more accurate than the external errors on individual passband magnitudes .",
    "this is illustrated later .",
    "of course , systematic errors can only be truly assessed with respect to external data that can be regarded as ` gold ' standard , i.e.  free from systematic error and having negligible random error , and we also describe comparisons against external ccd data that are of sufficient angular resolution and signal  to  noise that they can be regarded as error ",
    "free for these purposes .        in order to assess the consistency of the image classification , we compared data from each of the four survey types j , r , i and eso  r in the large ( @xmath117 ) overlap region between field numbers  292 and  241 . in figure  [ clsprob](a ) to  ( d ) we show plots of the percentage agreement between the two independent classifications , as a funcion of magnitude , for stars ( solid circles ) and galaxies ( open circles ) .",
    "( 150,90 )    these were analysed for the _ underlying _ correct classification for a single measurement using the following argument .",
    "assume that there are just the two image classes , stellar and galaxian ( the fraction of noise and unclassifiable images on any plate is always @xmath118% ) .",
    "if we denote the probability that a real star is classified as such in any given magnitude range by @xmath119 and the probability that a real galaxy is classed as such by @xmath120 along with probabilities for incorrect classification by @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( where the subscript refers to plate  1 and similar definitions are made for the overlapping plate  2 ) , we have that for plate  1 for example @xmath123 and similarly for plate  2 . between the two independent measurements , the probability of agreement for stellar class ( for example ) is equal to the sum of the probability that both measurements class a real star as such and the probability that both measurements misclassify a galaxy as a star : @xmath124 likewise for agreement on galaxian classification : @xmath125 assume now that the noise parameters and general image quality of the plates are the same , i.e.  write @xmath126 etc .  and since we are not interested in the cross terms in equations  [ three ] and  [ four ] they can be eliminated using equations  [ one ] and  [ two ] to yield @xmath127 which is a set of two non  linear equations in the two unknowns  @xmath128 and  @xmath129 . these are soluble using a simple iterative scheme , and in figure  [ clsprob](a ) to  ( d ) we plot the derived functions @xmath128 ( solid lines ) and @xmath129 ( dashed lines ) .    from figure  [ clsprob ] ,",
    "the image classification scheme is clearly working well , with stellar classification being _ internally _ repeatable / reliable at the @xmath130% level for magnitudes b@xmath131 , r  @xmath132 ( or r  @xmath133 for eso ",
    "r ) and i  @xmath134 . for galaxies ,",
    "classification is reliable at the @xmath4% level in the ranges @xmath135 , @xmath136 but is clearly not so good for the i plates .",
    "this is possibly due to the generally poorer signal  to  noise of i  band schmidt plates .",
    "note that reliable image classification for all i  images is of course available from the b@xmath1 data unless an object is severely reddened or intrinsically very red .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the only true test of the image classification reliability is against external data .",
    "this is because the above analysis can not take into account any systematic effects ( for example , classification of large numbers of faint , unresolved galaxies as stellar objects ) .",
    "such a rigorous test is detailed in section  [ extsg ] . on the other hand",
    ", this internal test illustrates that the classification scheme is not severely limited by random errors at magnitudes as faint as @xmath137 above the respective plate limits .      using the same overlap region as in the previous section ,",

    "relative galaxy magnitudes are , in general , worse than those of stars in a given magnitude range , as expected .",
    "the systematic errors for bright stellar images are partly due to positional effects and partly due to the assumption of a mean gradient for the linear part of the profile magnitude scale .",
    "since the gradient of the isophotal scale is also tied to this mean gradient , then systematic effects are also increasingly apparent in increasingly bright galaxian magnitude ranges due to the linear extrapolation from the faint levels at which the zeropoint is fixed .",

    "the rms values about the @xmath234 lines in figure  [ colover ] are @xmath235  mag , indicating single measurement random errors in the colours at the level of @xmath236  mag in this magnitude range .",

    "the reason for this is that fainter than m  @xmath138 , the typical size of detectable galaxian images is comparable to the seeing on the photographic plate material , and the image classification scheme inevitably classifies unresolved sources as stars . in figures  [ clsprob](a ) to  ( b ) the accuracy of the classification is overestimated since there is a systematic trend for objects to be classed as stellar regardless of their actual type .",
    "the false level of agreement on stellar classification potentially leads to a correspondingly false estimate of the underlying classification accuracy for both image types ; however it is clear from the internal reliability that some very faint , non  stellar sources must be consistenly classified as such when it is possible to detect their non  stellar nature from the photographic data .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reliability estimates from table  [ carter ] were made from a field which presents a small zenith distance at the uk schmidt telescope , while tables  [ eqj ] and  [ eqr ] are based on data at the celestial equator .",
    "this probably accounts for their poorer image classification reliability .      as illustrated in figure  [ jrelphothist ] , while the survey field photometric zeropoints are defined globally using faint objects in overlap regions along with a network of ccd standards , at increasingly bright magnitudes systematic errors become apparent .",
    "this is due to the assumption of a single global gradient for the characteristic curve for the plates in any given colour .",
    "furthermore , it is to be expected that systematic errors will be dependent on plate position as well as magnitude , since the photographic response will not be perfectly uniform within a single plate .",
    "this is illustrated in more detail in figure  [ stonemag](a ) to  ( d ) , where we have compared sgc r photometry against the sdss calibration region  a ( stone , pier & monet  1999 ) .",
    "these data are in a slightly different passband ( sloan r as oppose to r@xmath84 ) but the difference is negligible at the accuracy we require , and the random errors on the ccd data are negligible compared to the photographic errors .",
    "the ccd data encompass @xmath249 and are therefore ideal for showing position dependent systematics over areas that traverse photographic plate boundaries .",
    "( 80,210 )    in figure  [ stonemag](a ) to  ( d ) we have divided the data in @xmath250 into four 2  mag ranges ; the vertical error vectors are scaled such that @xmath251 .",
    "only stars have been used in this analysis .",
    "the following points should be noted :    * in the faintest magnitude range ( @xmath252 ) there are no significant zeropoint errors within a field or in traversing to an adjacent field .",
    "* there are global systematic zeropoint errors within individual fields at the level of several tenths of a magnitude for @xmath253 ; these are , in general , different for different fields .",
    "* at bright magnitudes , the systematic errors change within a single field as a function of plate position .",
    "these variations are once more at the level of several tenths of a magnitude .",
    "finally , we have checked the external errors ( i.e.  those resulting in a straightforward comparison between an external dataset and our survey data , with no regard as to the systematic nature of those errors ) of our bri photometry in the equatorial zone by combining data from landolt  ( 1992 ) and boyle et al .",
    "note that although the boyle et al .",
    "data have been used to measure gradients and tie down zeropoints ( sections  [ grads ] and  [ global ] ) , they have not been used to derive detailed individual calibration curves on a plate  by  plate basis .",
    "galaxy photometric precision has been assessed using the metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) data along with data from cunow et al .",
    "( 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "table  [ absacc ] shows the results .",
    "the main point to note from this comparison is that brighter than m  @xmath96 , there can be large errors in the photometry ( their origin is discussed previously ) .",
    "fainter than this , in general the stellar photometry is typically accurate to @xmath254 ( at best , @xmath255 ) until the respective plate limits are approached , whereupon emulsion noise begins to dominate and the random errors rise again ( this is particularly noticeable for the lower s / n serc  i and poss  e plates ) .",
    "it is also clear that galaxy photometry is , in general , less accurate than stellar photometry in a given magnitude range as expected .",
    "figure  [ extcol ] illustrates external checks on the colour indices b@xmath1r and b@xmath1i from the same data , in the natural systems of the photographic emulsion / filter passbands .",
    "these indicate the external accuracy of the sss colours . despite the presence of large systematic errors on individual magnitudes , the colours are accurate to the levels indicated in the previous internal consistency check : at b@xmath11 , the colours are accurate to the level @xmath10",
    "; at b@xmath256 ( typical of the external comparison stars in figure  [ extcol ] ) the errors rise to @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence of any systematic errors in the colours greater than @xmath235  mag , vindicating the choice of colour zeropoints given in table  [ blueshifts ] .
