    "magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and turbulence generated by these instabilities can play an important role in enhancing transport processes in various astrophysical bodies , such as accretion and protoplanetary disks , galaxies , stellar radiative zones , etc .",
    "anomalous turbulent transport caused by instabilities can be particularly important in differentially rotating and magnetized gas where a number of mhd instabilities may occur .",
    "it is known since the classical papers by velikhov ( 1959 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) that a differentially rotating flow with a negative angular velocity gradient and a weak magnetic field is unstable to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "this instability has been analyzed in detail for stellar conditions ( see fricke 1969 , acheson 1978 , 1979 ) . in the context of accretion disks , this instability was first considered by balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) .",
    "there are strong arguments that the necessary condition of the magnetorotational instability ( a decrease of the angular velocity with cylindrical radius ) is fulfilled in disks ( see , e.g. , kaisig , tajima , & lovelace 1992 , kumar , coleman , & kley 1994 , zhang , diamond , & vishniac 1994 ) .",
    "the instability exists not only for short wavelength perturbations , but also for global modes with scales comparable to the disk height ( curry , pudritz , & sutherland 1994 , curry & pudritz 1995 ) .",
    "likely , the magnetorotational instability may develop in astrophysical plasma under a wide spectrum of conditions .",
    "the effect of radiation on stability of magnetized differentially rotating flow has been studied analytically by blaes & socrates ( 2001 ) and numerically by turner , stone , & sano ( 2002 ) who argued that the stability criterion remains unchanged in this case but the growth rate can be lower .",
    "recently , stability properties of magnetized accretion flows have been considered in the kerr metric by de villiers & hawley ( 2003 ) , de villiers , hawley , & krolik ( 2003 ) , and hirose et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found that the magnetorotational instability can drive turbulence in this case as well .",
    "the numerical study of the magnetorotational instability in magnetized accretion disks both in local ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 , hawley , gammie & balbus 1995 , matsumoto & tajima 1995 , arlt & rdiger 2001 ) and global ( armitage 1998 , hawley 2000 ) approximations show a breakdown of laminar keplerian flow into well - developed turbulence .",
    "the generated turbulence can be an efficient mechanism of the @xmath7-viscosity and angular momentum transport in accretion disks ( brandenburg et al . 1996 , hawley , gammie , & balbus 1996 , stone et al . 1996 ) . at low temperatures and high densities ,",
    "however , the level of turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability can decrease significantly or even turns off completely ( gammie 1996 , gammie & menou 1998 ) .    in recent years , many simulations of accretion disks have been performed , and much of the dynamics was interpreted as a direct consequence of the magnetorotational instability . obviously , however , that this instability can not be the only instability that operates in differentially rotating magnetized gaseous bodies .",
    "for example , convection may occur due to an outwardly decreasing entropy in radiatively inefficient magnetized accretion flow ( narayan et al .",
    "2002 ) or in radiation - dominated accretion disks ( see , e.g. , agol et al .",
    "if the angular velocity depends on the vertical coordinate , then stratification can be the reason of the baroclinic convection associated with non - parallel temperature and pressure gradients ( urpin & brandenburg 1998 , urpin 2003 ) .",
    "stratification can also lead to a wide variety of strong non - axisymmetric instabilities in accretion disks ( keppens , casse , & goedbloed 2002 ) .",
    "many previous stability analyses have adopted the boussinesq approximation , and have therefore neglected the effect of compressibility .",
    "this is valid provided that the magnetic field strength is essentially subthermal , and the sound speed is much greater than the alfvn velocity , @xmath8 .",
    "however , this can often be not the case in both astrophysical objects and many numerical simulations .",
    "the first attempt to consider the effect of compressibility on the magnetorotational instability was undertaken by blaes & balbus ( 1994 ) in the context of astrophysical disks .",
    "the authors consider a very simplified case of the wavevector parallel to the rotation axis and vanishing radial magnetic field . as a result",
    ", the most interesting physics has been lost in their study since only the standard magnetorotational instability operates in this simple geometry .",
    "for instance , the authors concluded that the azimuthal field does not affect the instability criterion in all orders in @xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion applies , however , only to the particular case considered by blaes & balbus ( 1994 ) and is incorrect in a more general magnetic configuration .",
    "a detailed study of the influence of @xmath2 on rotation induced instabilities is given by pessah & psaltis ( 2005 ) .",
    "these authors show that terms in the lorentz force proportional to @xmath9 where @xmath4 is the cylindrical radius can be dynamically important when superthermal magnetic fields are considered .",
    "the curvature of toroidal field lines plays a fundamental role in the local stability of strongly magnetized compressible plasmas .",
    "in particular , the combined influence of compressibility and the curvature term can give rise to two new instabilities .",
    "a more refined analyses of instability of a differentially rotating magnetized gas was undertaken by blokland et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and van der swaluw , blokland , & keppens ( 2005 ) who considered radially stratified disks in the cylindric limit .",
    "in particular , blokland et al .",
    "( 2005 ) investigate the influence of a toroidal field on the growth rate and frequency of eigenmodes and find that it leads to overstability ( complex eigenvalue ) and reduction of the growth rate .",
    "the overstable character of the magnetorotational instability increases as the angular velocity decreases .",
    "van der swaluw , blokland , & keppens ( 2005 ) study the interplay between different instabilities in accretion disks and argue that the growth rate of convection can be essentially increased due to magnetorotational effects .",
    "note that both these studies treat stability in the magnetic field with a vanishing radial component .    in this paper",
    ", we show that a number of instabilities may occur in a compressible differentially rotating magnetized gas which are different from the standard magnetorotational instability .",
    "these instabilities appear if the magnetic field has non - vanishing radial and azimuthal components and can manifest themselves even if stratification is neglected .",
    "the considered instabilities can be oscillatory or non - oscillatory and arise even if the magnetic field is strong enough to suppress the magnetorotational instability .",
    "our study generalizes the paper by bonanno & urpin ( 2005 ) where shear - driven magnetic instabilities were considered in a compressible flow for the particular case when the wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the standard magnetorotational instability does not operate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss the main equations and derive the dispersion relation for a compressible differentially rotating magnetized gas .",
    "stability properties of modes are considered in section 3 , and our numerical calculations of the growth rate are presented in section 4 . finally , we discuss our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we work in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) with the unit vectors ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the equations of compressible mhd read @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 our notation is as follows : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the gas density and velocity , respectively ; @xmath22 is the magnetic field ; @xmath23 is the pressure and @xmath24 is the adiabatic index",
    ".    the basic state on which the stability analysis is performed is assumed to be quasi - stationary with the angular velocity @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the basic state , then @xmath27 we consider magnetic configurations where both the radial and azimuthal field components are presented .",
    "the presence of a radial magnetic field and differential rotation in the basic state can lead to the development of the azimuthal field .",
    "nevertheless , the basic state can be considered sometimes as quasi - stationary despite the development of the toroidal field .",
    "for example , if the magnetic reynolds number is large , one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that the azimuthal field grows approximately linearly with time , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the azimuthal field at @xmath31 . as long as the second term on the r.h.s . is small compared to the first one or , in other words , @xmath32 stretching of the azimuthal field does not affect significantly the basic state ; @xmath33 is the characteristic timescale of generation of @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", the basic state can be treated as quasi - stationary during the time @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 , then steady - state can be maintained during a relatively long time before the generated azimuthal field begins to influence the basic state .",
    "we consider stability of axisymmetric short wavelength perturbations .",

    "therefore , one can expand coefficients in taylor series around some radial point and retain only the zeroth order terms in this expansion .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as the wavelength of perturbations is small compared to the lengthscales of unperturbed quantities .",

    "however , this estimate can be incorrect in accretion disks with substantially superthermal magnetic fields ( pessah & psaltis 2005 ) , but we do not address these objects in the present paper . since @xmath51 is the pressure scaleheight @xmath52 , we obtained that the ratio of the first and second terms on the r.h.s .",

    "criterion of the magnetorotational instability ( 19 ) can be rewritten in terms of the dimensionless parameters as @xmath177 for given values of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath166 , we obtain that this inequality satisfies in the region where @xmath180 .",
    "it is seen from fig .  1 that there is a real root with large re @xmath167 ( @xmath181 ) that can be identified with the magnetorotational instability ( which is always non - oscillatory in the incompressible limit ) .",
    "apart from this root , however , there exist another unstable root which is much smaller for the chosen values of parameters .",
    "the new root is positive in the region @xmath182 where the magnetorotational instability is completely suppressed .",
    "the new instability exists even in the region of very large @xmath168 in complete agreement with criterion ( 32 ) .",
    "the important point is that this unstable root is caused by compressibility and does not appear in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "the growth rate of the new instability is relatively small ( re @xmath183 ) for the chosen parameters because @xmath8 , and departures from the incompressible limit are small .",
    "the situation , however , can change qualitatively if the magnetic field is stronger , and we are beyond the necessary condition of the boussinesq approximation , @xmath184 .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the same dependence as in fig .  1 but for the case @xmath185 ( other parameters are same ) when compressibility plays much more important role .",
    "the boussinesq approximation does not apply in this case except the region of small @xmath186 .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetorotational instability can still occur in the region @xmath187 , and its growth rate is in a good agreement with the incompressible case . in the region of a strong field",
    ", however , there exists a new instability caused by shear and the magnetic field .",
    "compressibility is crucial for this new instability , and it can not be obtained in the incompressible limit .",
    "the growth rate of the newly found instability is rather high , re @xmath188 , in the region @xmath182 where the magnetorotational instability is suppressed . at a fixed wavelength of perturbations ,",
    "the growth rate increases slightly if the magnetic field becomes stronger .",
    "the new instability is not suppressed even by a very strong magnetic field .",
    "calculations show that further decrease of @xmath189 ( that is equivalent to increase of compressibility ) leads to a higher growth rate that can be even as high as re @xmath190 in some cases .",
    "the number of unstable roots and the growth rate are sensitive to a relative orientation of the azimuthal and radial magnetic fields .",
    "this orientation is characterized by the parameter @xmath191 , and we plot the growth rate versus @xmath168 for @xmath192 in fig .",
    "in contrast to fig .  2 , there are two couples of unstable complex conjugate roots for @xmath192 .",
    "as it was mentioned in sec.3 , apart from magnetosonic waves the alfven mode can be unstable as well if rotation is sufficiently fast .",
    "one couple has a larger growth rate ( re @xmath193 ) whereas another couple grows substantially slower ( re @xmath194 ) . as usual ,",
    "compressible instabilities are most efficient in the region where the magnetorotational instability does not occur ( @xmath182 ) . for @xmath192 , however , the compressible instabilities can arise even at @xmath180 , where they work in parallel to the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the above three figures illustrate the behavior of roots in the case when @xmath195 and , hence , the magnetorotational instability can operate if the magnetic field satisfies eq .",
    "the newly found instability , however , can arise in the case @xmath196 as well . in fig .  4",
    ", we plot the real parts of roots for @xmath197 that corresponds to @xmath198 ( other parameters are same as in fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is seen from the figure that there is no large root that could correspond to the magnetorotational instability in the region of low magnetic fields . instead , there are three couples of complex conjugate roots , and one of these couples has positive re @xmath167 .",
    "these roots represent a relatively weak shear - driven instability that operates at any field strength .",
    "obviously , the instability is weak ( re @xmath183 ) because @xmath8 ( or @xmath176 ) for the chosen parameters .",
    "however , the growth rate becomes larger as the magnetic field increases and departures grow from the incompressible limit .    in fig .",
    "5 , we show the growth rate for the case when the magnetorotational instability still does not occur ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 ) but the effect of compressibility is more significant than in fig .  4 since @xmath185 .",
    "again , all modes are complex , and two couples of complex roots are unstable . due to compressibility",
    ", the growth rate of the most unstable modes can reach rather high values @xmath199 . since the epicyclic frequency is large , @xmath200",
    ", we estimate the growth rate as @xmath201 , that implies that the growth time of instability is of the order of the rotation period , @xmath202 , in this case .",
    "therefore , the considered instability turns out to be very rapid even in those cases when the magnetorotational instability can not operate .",
    "note that the newly found instability may occur even if the magnetic field is very strong and the magnetic pressure is greater than the gas pressure ( or @xmath203 ) .",
    "generally , a dependence of the growth rate on the parameters @xmath178 and @xmath179 is relatively weak whereas the value @xmath204 plays more important role for instability . in fig .  6 ,",
    "this point is illustrated by calculations of re @xmath167 for @xmath205 that is larger than in the previous figures .",
    "in fact , the parameter @xmath204 characterizes the direction of @xmath100 with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the value @xmath205 implies that @xmath206 .",
    "calculations have been performed for @xmath185 to compare with the previous figure",
    ". a higher value of @xmath204 does not change complexity of the modes , and all roots are complex .",
    "generally , an increase in @xmath204 can lead to a larger number of unstable modes and a higher growth rate as it is seen from the figure .",
    "the dependence of re @xmath167 on the field strength becomes non - monotonic with maximum at @xmath207 .",
    "the maximum growth rate in fig .  6 is approximately 3 times greater than in the case @xmath173 .    in fig .  7",
    ", we plot the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath167 on @xmath166 for the case of radially decreasing @xmath208 ( @xmath169 ) and for @xmath209 , @xmath172 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "the unperturbed field strength is not sufficient to suppress the magnetorotational instability .",
    "solid lines show the growth rate and frequency for the complex roots , and dashed lines for the real roots .",
    "the real roots correspond to the magnetorotational instability which , in accordance with condition ( 41 ) , can occur only if @xmath213 for the given parameters . in the region of shorter wavelengths ( @xmath214 ) ,",
    "however , the magnetorotational instability is forbidden but the newly found instability can be efficient . in this region , there are two pairs of unstable complex conjugate roots and a pair of stable roots .",
    "the new instability is oscillatory , and arises despite the magnetic field is rather strong ( the thermal and magnetic energy are comparable ) . even in such a strong field",
    ", the growth time of instability is rather short , @xmath215 .",
    "note that the growth rate is weakly dependent on the wavelength for @xmath214 .    in fig .",
    "8 , we plot the same dependence as in fig .  7 but for the flow with @xmath197 which is stable to the magnetorotational instability at any magnetic field .",
    "only complex modes exist in such a flow and , as a result , instability is oscillatory . in this case , re @xmath167 is a bit smaller than for a flow with the keplerian angular velocity ( @xmath169 ) but , because of a high epicyclic frequency @xmath216 , the growth time is rather short , @xmath217 . as in the previous figure ,",
    "the growth rate is approximately same for all short wavelength perturbations .    finally",
    ", we plot in fig .",
    "9 the dependence of the growth rate on @xmath218 for rapidly rotating gas with @xmath219 .",
    "this figure illustrates the type of solutions that can exist in a relatively cold plasma . for such solutions ,",
    "the growth rate is rather high , @xmath220 .",
    "remarkably , that this high growth rate is achieved for perturbations with @xmath221 or , using the dimensionless parameters , @xmath222 .",
    "the calculated growth rate is in a reasonable agreement with estimate ( 26 ) since @xmath223 in the considered case .",
    "the growth rate is smaller than it is given by eq .",
    "( 29 ) for very large @xmath218 .",
    "note that the roots ( 27)-(28 ) were calculated under assumption @xmath109 whereas @xmath224 in the numerical solution .",
    "therefore , even the number of modes is different in eqs .",
    "( 24)-(25 ) and in fig .",
    "however , estimate of the growth rate ( 29 ) is still valid despite this difference .",
    "we have considered stability of differentially rotating magnetized gas taking account of the effect of compressibility and assuming that the magnetic field has non - vanishing radial and azimuthal components . in our stability analysis",
    ", we assume that the basic state is quasi - stationary .",
    "this assumption can be fulfilled in many cases of astrophysical interest despite the development of the azimuthal field from the radial one due to differential rotation .",
    "for instance , if the magnetic reynolds number is large then the timescale of generation of the toroidal field is @xmath225 ( see eq .",
    "( 8) ) in the case @xmath226 .",
    "obviously , the basic state can be considered as quasi - stationary if the growth time of instability is shorter than @xmath33 . as it is seen from eq .",
    "( 29 ) , the growth rate of instability can be roughly estimated as @xmath227 if @xmath88 .",
    "then , the condition of quasi - stationarity reads @xmath228    the physics of the instability is very simple . to clarify its nature",
    ", we consider the simplest case of a cold gas with @xmath109 .",
    "assume that the background magnetic field has only radial @xmath229 and azimuthal @xmath34 component , and the perturbation is a plane wave in the @xmath11-direction , such as @xmath230 .",
    "the wave produces the density perturbation @xmath231 that is also an oscillatory function of @xmath11 .",
    "since the magnetic field is assumed to be frozen into the gas , compression / decompression should perturb the magnetic field .",
    "the perturbation of the radial component is simply related to the density perturbation , @xmath232 .",
    "the azimuthal perturbation is determined by two processes and can be written as @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the perturbation caused by compression / decompression in the wave and @xmath235 is caused by stretching of the azimuthal field from the perturbation of the radial component due to differential rotation .",
    "the rate of stretching is @xmath236 and , hence , @xmath237 .",
    "then , the perturbation of the azimuthal field is given by @xmath238 note that this equation is exactly equivalent to the @xmath10-component of eq .",
    "( 16 ) if we assume @xmath239 and substitute @xmath240 as it follows from the continuity equation ( 14 ) .",
    "the perturbation of the field leads to the lorentz force which , in its turn , generates the vertical velocity .",
    "the lorentz force is equal to @xmath241 .",
    "then , the perturbation of the vertical velocity is @xmath242 in its turn , vertical motions should generate perturbations of the density since the gas is compressible .",
    "we have from the continuity condition @xmath243 combining eqs .",
    "( 43)-(45 ) , we obtain the expression governing density perturbations @xmath244 if we assume that @xmath245 , then the growth rate is determined by the condition @xmath246 this equation describes the same magnetic modes as eq .  ( 24 ) does in the case @xmath247 . indeed , in the case @xmath248 ( or @xmath249 ) , eq .",
    "( 24 ) can be transformed into @xmath250 such as the modes affected by the magnetic field are described by eq .  ( 47 ) .",
    "it is seen from this simple explanation , that shear and compressibility play the major role in the instability .    in the incompressible limit that applies",
    "if @xmath8 , differentially rotating flows can be subject to the well - known magnetorotational instability ( velikhov 1959 , chandrasekhar 1960 ) that arises if the angular velocity decreases with the cylindrical radius .",
    "it turns out , however , that compressibility alters drastically the stability properties of magnetized rotating flows .",
    "apart from instabilities caused by `` the curvature terms '' ( see pessah & psaltis 2005 ) , a number of new instabilities can occur in the presence of a radial magnetic field .",
    "the properties of these instabilities are very much different from those of the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the necessary condition of these new instabilities is given by eq .",
    "( 35 ) and reads @xmath251 .",
    "since differential rotation always generates the azimuthal magnetic field from the radial one , the necessary and sufficient condition of instability is the presence of a radial field in differentially rotating flows .",
    "obviously , this condition can widely be satisfied in astrophysical bodies .",
    "note that , contrary to the magnetorotational instability that occurs only if the angular velocity decreases with the cylindrical radius , the newly found instabilities may occur at any sign of @xmath6 .",
    "likely , the most important difference between the magnetorotational and newly found instabilities is associated with the dependence on the magnetic field strength . a sufficiently strong magnetic field ,",
    "satisfying the inequality @xmath252 , suppresses completely the standard magnetorotational instability . on the contrary , the instability found in our paper",
    "can not be suppressed even in relatively strong magnetic fields ( but satisfying inequality ( 23))as it is seen from the criterion ( 35 ) .",
    "often , the growth rate reaches some saturation in very strong magnetic field , and this saturated value can be rather high ( re @xmath253 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the newly found instabilities is rather high and can even be comparable to @xmath254 for some values of parameters .",
    "generally , the growth rate depends on compressibility , being smaller for a low compressibility .",
    "the incompressible limit ( boussinesq approximation ) corresponds to @xmath8 , and the considered instabilities are inefficient in this limit because of a low growth rate .",
    "however , in the case of a strong field with @xmath255 when the boussinesq approximation does not apply , the instability can be much more efficient than the magnetorotational instability .",
