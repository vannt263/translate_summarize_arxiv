    "it is presented here a gadget model of the wilson - kogut @xcite renormalization group implemented in a quantum mechanical problem , a bit following the mood of @xcite .",
    "but our scheme is complex enough to be a good introduction before to go to full qft - oriented reviews , as the recent one from ball - thorpe @xcite .",
    "examples of the renormalization group in qm have been built using the traditional beta function setup ( by example , see @xcite ) and , recently , the path integral formalism @xcite . to get a non trivial w - k flow we work with qm on @xmath1 .",
    "this one - dimensional setup is richer ( and more complicated ) than typical `` tridimensional '' problems in @xmath2 , which are usually reduced to problems in the one dimensional half line . by working with the full real line",
    "we are forced to calculate in matrix form , which make the problem more illuminating in the long way .",
    "this can be seen , by example , by comparing newton @xcite vs. fadeev @xcite solutions of the 1-d inverse scattering problem .",
    "our scheme moves close to the standard studies of contact interactions : self - adjoint extensions @xcite , series of hamiltonians @xcite , regularizations @xcite etc .",
    "so it can illuminate some recent conflicts in the literature , such as the status of the controversial @xmath3 interaction ( which , btw , would be scale - invariant in one dimension or at least to present characteristics close to the @xmath4 studies from @xcite ) .",
    "this preprint represents work in course .",
    "rigorization of convergence issues in the perturbative analisis is in process .",
    "effort has been done to implement major features of the renormalization group , but some interesting points , as c - functions or correlation lengths are not implemented yet .    plan of this paper is as follows : in section 1 we make some introductory remarks and the plan of the paper is presented .",
    "section 2 defines the interaction we are going to study and sketch some needed formulae . in section 3",
    "the wilson - kogut rg is built and fixed points are calculated .",
    "section 4 show some examples of trajectories got directly from known solutions , for comparation .",
    "section 5 completes the topological analysis of the rg flow calculating the stable and unstable directions at fixed points .",
    "sections 6 and 7 sketch some examples showing how the mechanics of of regularizated potentials and renormalized couplings .",
    "both sections are mainly didactical and only needed points are detailed .",
    "we conclude in section 8 with some specific remarks about contact interactions .",
    "a localized interaction with cut - off @xmath5 will correspond to an interaction which is free out of the interval @xmath6 , but can have any form in the interior of this interval .",
    "so we work only with data external to @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , it can be said that the cutoff `` hides '' or `` averages '' any characteristic of the interaction in distances lower than the cutoff , see figure 1 .",
    "we can characterize such interactions either by their scattering matrix , @xmath7 or by some matrix specifying the boundary conditions in @xmath8 .",
    "an useful one , given its dimensional and scaling properties @xcite , is @xmath9 @xmath10 where the parameters in @xmath11 are reals , but can become indeterminates or infinity for some interactions . in such case , we could use other formulations @xcite , closer to the standard formalism of self adjoint extensions .",
    "note that , in principle -and forgetting some of inverse scattering theory- , different hamiltonians could be localized in the same interval with equal conditions at the boundary ; thus the @xmath5-cutoff in some sense hides data about the interaction to distance less than @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction being free out of this interval , the asymptotic solution of the schroedinger equation must remain valid over all this zone @xmath13 .",
    "thus we can use the explicit definition of the @xmath14-matrix to connect the boundary conditions at both sides of the interval . as we will need it in our examples ,",
    "lets skectch the formulae . for each eigenvalue @xmath15 , we can chose two independent solutions @xmath16 of the schroedinger eq . fulfilling : @xmath17 and evaluate them at @xmath18 and @xmath5 to solve for the matrix @xmath19 ; and reciprocally for @xmath20 .",
    "we get the following relationships .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22    there are no problem going from one description to the other , as here the only role of both @xmath20 and @xmath23 here is to select a pair of eigenfunctions . and",
    "requesting @xmath20 to be unitary and complete , the set of admisible solutions coincide with the result got in @xcite , as @xmath20 unitary iff @xmath23 hermitian , and @xmath24 would imply @xmath23=cte when @xmath25 . ]    to be fully `` wilson - kogut compliant '' and draw the renormalization flow in the space of fixed cut - off theories , it is need to work with the adimensional matrices @xmath26 : @xmath27 in this form , the relationship becomes : @xmath28 @xmath29 where now the ( @xmath15-dependent ) matrix terms @xmath30 refer to the adim matrix @xmath31 .",
    "as usual , we take the space @xmath32 of all the @xmath33-cutoff interactions , in dimensionless form",
    ". each interaction can be given by a unitary @xmath34 , which by standard scattering theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) will fulfill @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the hermitian conjugate .",
    "we could in addition restrict ourselves to interactions invariant under time reversal .",
    "in such case , we would add the condition @xmath38 , which implies @xmath39 and the know reciprocity theorem @xmath40    now , we define that two theories are in the same line of the renormalization group flow if there are a pair of scales @xmath41 such that when we apply them to its respective theories , we get the same physics ( see figure 2 ) , ie the same @xmath14-matrix in physical dimensions .",
    "equivalently , @xmath42 will be the result of applying a rg transformation to @xmath43 iff @xmath44 , this is , @xmath45 = \\tilde s_{e^{-t}\\tilde{k}}\\ ] ]    so the fixed points will be constant @xmath46 matrices .",
    "this is , the subset of @xmath47 fulfilling property ( [ conjug ] ) , namely : @xmath48    if we want to study only t - invariant potentials , we must add condition ( [ recipr ] ) , and the set of fixed points reduces further to @xmath49 where the continuous circle of fixed points can be interpreted corresponding to kurasov @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the rest of contact interactions is not scale - invariant , so we need to study the flow near the fixed points to find them , as relevant parameters .",
    "note that there are aditional asumptions on the analytic properties of @xmath14 , but we do nt need to impose them to determine the fixed points , so they will be commented when needed in section [ stability ] . at this point , note simply that the caracterization of space of interactions is supossed to be restricted to potentials with range smaller that the cut - off .",
    "before entering in perturbative theory , it is good to give an idea about what results we expect , to more easily follow the argument .",
    "there are a four - parametric family of self - adjoint extensions to the free hamiltonian in @xmath50 . in this section",
    "we calculate some subfamilies of scattering matrices for known extensions and show its form near a fixed point .    following the standard theory(@xcite ) , lets take contact - interaction given by the constant matrix at a cutoff @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 its scattering matrix is : @xmath53 which , using the lenght @xmath5 to remove dimensions , corresponds to a line @xmath54 of renormalized interactions . by construction , the rg transformation ( [ rg.trans ] ) can be compensated by a change in the `` spacing '' ( or cutoff ) @xmath5 .",
    "as explained in figure 3 , we expect solution lines to be end - pointed by fixed points .",
    "specifically , we see that :    \\a ) for @xmath55 finite , which correspond to two separate half - lines , the rg flow goes from @xmath56 we get this result in general for any @xmath57 finite and different of zero .",
    "\\b ) for @xmath58 infinite , @xmath59 finite , which for @xmath60 is the traditional @xmath61-interaction , we get the flow going @xmath62 in particular , we see that the fixed point governing the @xmath61 is the identity .",
    "\\c ) for @xmath58 finite but @xmath63 ( which when @xmath60 is the so - called ( by @xcite ) @xmath3-interaction ) the flow travels along @xmath64    so all the interactions of this kind are to be governed either by transparent interactions or by the totally reflective one .",
    "these observations are summarized in figure 4 .",
    "it is instructive to look the interactions in the form @xmath65 near a fixed point ( around an endpoint , if we prefer to ignore rg terminology in this section ) .",
    "we get for `` + q '' @xmath66 for @xmath67 : @xmath68 and for each @xmath69 : @xmath70    with this , we can see outgoing and ingoing trajectories near a fixed point :    -lines starting from @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xmath73    -starting from `` + q '' with @xmath63 @xmath74    -from @xmath69 with @xmath75 : @xmath76    now , for the incoming lines we define @xmath77 , so @xmath78 and we get :    -lines incoming to @xmath79 , @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath80    -arriving to @xmath67 : ( a ) with @xmath72 @xmath81 and from lines type ( b ) : @xmath82    ( note that the approximations here are given in a non rigurous way , simply to have a reference for the next section )    it s worth to note that the coupling constants appear clearly related to the ( dimensional ) constant we used to remove dimensions of @xmath15 .",
    "compare e.g. with @xcite .",
    "now , we need to develop a perturbation theory around the fixed point directly in the s - matrix formalism . in some neighbourhood of the identity , where the exponential map is one ot one , we can use the generators @xmath83 of the @xmath47 group , and write the perturbed system as @xmath84 with @xmath85.for @xmath86 small , we can put it as : @xmath87    the generators of u(2 ) are @xmath88 ( remember that @xmath89 so , around + q we get @xmath90 and for the other fixed points we have @xmath91    as our space of interactions impose restrictions to the admisible @xmath20 , we get restrictions on @xmath92 depending on the fixed point . imposing condition ( [ conjug ] ) around @xmath93 we get @xmath94 of course , the additional asumption ( [ recipr ] ) of reciprocity imposes @xmath95 .",
    "now , we put the rg transformation in differential form .",
    "@xmath96    where @xmath97    we are looking for vectors @xmath92 such that @xmath98 which to first - order amounts to @xmath99    so we have an eigenvalue equation @xmath100 which solves to @xmath101    as an example , lets calculate the flow near @xmath93 with some detail .",
    "it could seem that the valid @xmath92 would be @xmath102    now , finite range condition when required in even potentials implies for the fase shifts at small @xmath15 @xmath103 so , this condition for our space of interactions rules out the combinations @xmath104 as well as higher orders in @xmath15 , and let us with four directions , @xmath105 which coincides with the known result , derived in the previous section . here",
    ", the marginal direction ( [ dir.kurasov ] ) can be asociated with the circle of kurasov @xmath106 family ; the relevant one ( [ dir.delta ] ) is the usual @xmath61 , and the irrelevant parameter one ( [ dir.albeverio ] ) can be seen as coming from the fixed point @xmath71 , then producing the line corresponding to albeverio et al .",
    "so - called @xmath106 ( which happens to be not scale - invariant ) .",
    "finally , lets note that direction ( [ dir.no.t ] ) produces a family of scale invariant interactions which havent time - reversal symmetry .",
    "given a series of cutoff interactions the rg mechanism , as explained in figure 3 , let us to obtain .",
    "a renormalized interaction at a given scale @xmath33 ,    lets see , as first example , the series of effective pseudopotentials @xmath107 proposed by carreau @xcite .",
    "each @xmath108 is zero out of the interval @xmath6 , and the m matrix at @xmath109 always the same and independent of @xmath15 . in such case",
    ", we get a series @xmath110 in the space of dimensionless cutoff interactions .",
    "the @xmath46 matrix is : @xmath111 where now the parameters @xmath112 are the constants of the initial matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the limit @xmath113 is @xmath114 , where @xmath115 one of the fixed points studied in section 5 .",
    "obviously the rg transformation moves @xmath116 towards @xmath117 ; so when using the rg we will move near @xmath117 and the renormalized series will converge to a renormalized interaction in the relevant line . to be concrete , we begin with a cut - off @xmath33 , and for each @xmath5 we recover the original scale by applying @xmath118 , thus getting : @xmath119 and we see that in the limit @xmath113 we recover ( [ ren.line ] ) , as expected .",
    "to go for a more complicated example , lets use the two - deltas regulator for @xmath3 interaction ( this would be as a core - shell regularization ) , @xmath120    the matching conditions are : @xmath121 the scattering matrix is : @xmath122 which goes to @xmath67 as @xmath123 .    in the adim space",
    "this stuff becomes : @xmath124 @xmath125 and the limits are : @xmath126    this shows the qualitative diference between both formalisms . in ( [ s2d ] )",
    "we simply take the limit @xmath123 expecting in to be well - behaved ( as it happens in this simple case ) . in the rg approach , we first got the limit point , and then we look for the fixed point atracting it .    here , any limiting procedure will carry us inexorably to the dirichlet fixed point ( see seba ) .",
    "if we want to get a non trivial result , we need to implementent a dependence for the coupling constant .",
    "this can be seen a la tarrach in the implicit equations ; if @xmath127 the eq ( [ implicit ] ) has a indetermination and we will need go to g(a ) .",
    "lets continue with the previous example .",
    "we ask for a @xmath128 dependence giving us a non trivial limit .",
    "the example is simple enough to directly read the answer from ( [ s2d ] ) .",
    "regretly the rg mechanism in qm is too simple @xcite and it is not possible to get remarkable differences .",
    "lets sketch the method anyway .    equation ( [ s2d.adim ] ) let us define a subset @xmath129 of interactions in the space @xmath14 . we need to get series @xmath130 such that the limit point @xmath123 falls in the atracttion point of a non trivial fixed point .",
    "any @xmath128 going to zero as @xmath123 makes the trick , falling directly in the fixed point @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , we want the corresponding renormalized series @xmath132 to have a non trivial limit .",
    "this is enforced in the usual manner , asking for no dependence of @xmath5 in the limit .",
    "this is get by putting @xmath133 and then @xmath134 which is the s - matrix of the @xmath61 interaction .",
    "of course , if we put @xmath135 , as given by the usual scaling , we get @xmath136 so we have got an alternate derivation of the known result of seba @xcite .",
    "we can always get a known regularization of the @xmath61 or the @xmath137 and look for the renormalized interaction .",
    "it can be got partial but important information simply taking the limit of the unrenormalized series and asking which fixed point is reached when applying the rg to this limit interaction . by example , lets note that even if the nonrenormalized interaction falls in the atraction domain of the two half - lines fixed point , @xmath138 , it is unlikely to reach any interaction in the renormalized line if the series happens to fall in the domain of @xmath139 .    in particular , if we want to reach a limit of the kind of albeverio et al .",
    "`` @xmath106 '' , we will need series of interactions in the attraction domain of the @xmath131 , and with its limit in the domain of @xmath71 .",
