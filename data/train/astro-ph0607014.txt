    "probing the atmospheres of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) by measuring their spectra is the paramount means to determine their physical and chemical character ( burrows 2005 ) .",
    "such direct measurements complement the kinematic and orbital information obtained through the radial - velocity ( rv ) technique by which the vast majority of the egps have to date been discovered and studied .",
    "however , an egp s spectrum and phase - dependent light curve can in principle reveal or constrain the molecular and atomic compositions , atmospheric temperatures , cloud properties , albedos in the optical , and the degree to which the heat absorbed on the dayside is redistributed to the nightside before reradiation .",
    "the advection of heat and material from the dayside by jet streams and zonal winds will alter the dayside atmospheric temperatures and non - equilibrium compositions ( menou et al .",
    "2002 ; cho et al . 2003 ; burkert et al . 2005 ; iro , bzard , & guillot 2005 ; showman & guillot 2002 ; guillot & showman 2002 ) , and might measurably shift the light curve with respect to the orbital ephemeris ( cooper & showman 2005 ; williams et al .",
    "dynamic meteorology could also introduce zonal banding , as seen in jupiter and saturn , and temporal fluctuations , and does influence the rate with which heat is lost from the inner core ( burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard 2003 ; burrows et al .",
    "2004 ) , and thereby the radius of the planet and its evolution .",
    "moreover , such redistribution affects the near- and mid - infrared emissions from the night side , and as a result will affect the interpretation of nightside data when they become available .",
    "the planet / star flux ratios of wide - separation egps ( @xmath1 au ) are quite low ( @xmath2 to 10@xmath3 ) and vary widely as a function of wavelength and orbital separation ( with the concomitant non - monotonic variations in geometric and bond albedos ) ( sudarsky , burrows , & pinto 2000 ; burrows , sudarsky , & hubeny 2004 ; sudarsky et al . 2005 ; burrows 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , space - based coronagraphic techniques can be designed with inner working angles and contrast capabilities that will eventually image such planetary systems in the optical and mid - ir and distinguish planet from star ( trauger et al .",
    "2000 ; trauger , hull , & redding 2001 ) .",
    "however , the close - in egps with orbital semi - major axes less than @xmath40.1 au will not be imaged separately any time soon . in these cases , distinguishing the planet s spectrum from that of the star requires different techniques that do nt rely on imaging .",
    "fortunately , it has been shown recently by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and deming et al .",
    "( 2005,2006 ) that the _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared space telescope can discern changes in the summed light of a transiting egp and primary star due to the occultation of the planet by the star during secondary eclipse ( phase angle , @xmath5 , near 0@xmath6 ) .",
    "the difference in the summed light just before and during planetary eclipse provides a measure of the irradiated planet s emissions in the _ spitzer _ irac bands at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 , in the mips band at 24 , and via the _ spitzer_/irs . to date",
    ", nine transiting egps have been discovered ( charbonneau , brown , burrows , & laughlin 2006 ) , four ( hd209458b , tres-1 , hd189733b , and hd149026b ) are close enough to attempt secondary eclipse measurements with adequate signals - to - noise , and , as of this writing , eclipses for three transiting egps have in fact been detected .",
    "the corresponding planet / star flux ratios at superior conjunction are for tres-1 0.00066@xmath70.00013 and 0.00225@xmath70.00036 at 4.5 and 8.0 , respectively ( charbonneau et al . 2005 ) , for hd209458b 0.0026@xmath70.00045 at 24 ( deming et al .",

    "burrows , hubeny , & sudarsky ( 2005 ) concluded that these data are best interpreted with atmospheres containing water and carbon monoxide for which redistribution to the night side is significant , but partial .",
    "they conclude that the metallicity dependence is very weak and predict that the flux at 3.6 is higher than that at 4.5 .",
    "they also predict a broad peak near 10 , not so obvious in the theoretical results of others .",

    "( 2005 ) emphasize the potential effects of non - solar c / o ratios above 1.0 , in particular the associated lowering of the water abundance and weakening of the water absorption features .",

    "barman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) conclude that some redistribution must be occurring in the atmospheres of both hd209458b and tres-1 , but have trouble simultaneously fitting the two tres-1 data points .",
    "all groups find that the atmospheric temperatures are , as expected , hot and above @xmath41000 k , but the predicted planet / star contrast ratio spectra at superior conjunction vary perceptibly from group to group .    with the irs peak - up measurement of hd189733b at @xmath416 , and the secondary eclipse data anticipated in the near future for the remaining combinations of object and _ spitzer _ band , the time is ripe for a new set of theoretical spectral models and predictions for hd209458b , tres-1 , and hd189733b at superior conjunction ( @xmath10 ) , as well as for the corresponding light curves for the general phase angle , @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper , we provide such models and compare to the extant data to extract physical information about the atmospheres of these three transiting egps .",
    "we also make predictions for the light curves as a function of wavelength and the degree of redistribution to the nightside , and explore the metallicity dependence of the secondary eclipse predictions . to calculate the phase light curves",

    "( 2005 ) , but introduce the redistribution parameter , p@xmath11 , which is the fraction of the stellar energy intercepted by the planet that is redistributed to the nightside .",
    "= 0.5 model would result in slightly greater ir fluxes from the nightside than the dayside . ]",
    "p@xmath11 = 0 means no redistribution .",
    "we calculate for a given star / planet system and p@xmath11 both the dayside and nightside atmospheric temperature(@xmath12)/pressure(@xmath13 ) profiles and the associated spectra , and then for a given phase angle , @xmath5 , combine the emissions from the two hemispheres to derive the total planet fluxes at the earth for 300 wavelengths logarithmically spaced from 2.5 to 30 and the corresponding planet / star flux ratios . limb darkening effects for the day and night sides and planetary bond , geometric , and spherical albedos for the day side are automatically derived in the calculations and are not imposed artificially .",
    "we have opted in this paper for the p@xmath0 parametrization , and not the @xmath9 parametrization mentioned above and introduced by burrows et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , because it is better tied to the core issue of heat redistribution , and because @xmath9 is definitionally tied to stellar irradiation , which is in fact absent on the nightside .",
    "modeling the heating on the nightside with a flux at the base of the atmosphere that accounts for the advection of heat by winds seemed a bit more physical than heating the nightside by the ensatz of external insolation .",
    "the results are predictions for the three transiting egps as a function of wavelength or _ spitzer _ band and six values of p@xmath11 ( \\{0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 } ) .",
    "we thereby derive the dependence of the planet / star flux ratio spectra upon redistribution fraction and phase angle , albeit in the context of a simplified meteorological model .",
    "the spectral model , however , is state - of - the - art . in addition",
    ", we determine for the three close - in egps the approximate p@xmath11 dependence of the day and night side @xmath14 profiles and pay special attention to the temporal and phase dependence of the flux ratios in the irac bands and the 24- mips band during a full orbit ( @xmath15 ) , not just at superior conjunction ( secondary eclipse ) . in this way",
    ", we provide a complete set of theoretical models both for comparison with current data and for predicting future measurements .",
    "though our baseline models are for solar metallicity , we find that the metallicity dependence , without clouds and for solar abundance ratios , is small ( see  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "it is in the near- and mid - infrared that the planet - to - star flux ratio is most favorable for the direct detection of the light of a close - in egp .",
    "the general theory makes this clear ( burrows et al .",
    "2001 ; burrows et al . 2004 ; sudarsky et al . 2005 ; burrows 2005 ) , but this can be most easily demonstrated with a graph of the contrast ratio versus wavelength for a sample of the closest egps .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] depicts theoretical orbital - phase averaged ( sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny 2003 ) flux ratios from the optical through 30 , under the assumption of complete redistribution and ignoring any possible cloud effects , for five of the most interesting close - in egps : hd209458b , hd189733b , tres-1 , 51 peg b , and @xmath16 boo b. the first three are transiting and are discussed in more detail in following sections .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] demonstrates the advantages of working in the mid - ir .",
    "not only is the stellar flux lower there , but absorption by nascent sodium and potassium in the optical and near - ir renders measurements at shorter wavelengths problematic , even for the most sensitive space telescopes . to date , only upper limits have been obtained to the planet / star contrasts in the optical and the corresponding albedos ( e.g. , rowe et al . 2006 ) .",
    "contrasts in the optical of @xmath17 to @xmath18 are expected , improving to only @xmath2 to 10@xmath19 in the near - ir .    however , as fig .",

    "the bond albedos are low ( @xmath24 ; sudarsky , burrows , & pinto 2000 ) and p@xmath0 = 0.5 corresponds approximately to symmetric losses on the day and night sides .",
    "we point out that the roughly isothermal region on the dayside is an effect of stellar irradiation , which is absent on the nightside .",
    "this is the region where the outward core flux and the inwardly penetrating stellar flux are in rough balance ( see hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky 2003 for a more detailed explanation ) .",
    "it is important to note that despite the fact that the inner boundary condition for egp atmospheres on both the day and the night sides should be that they have the same interior entropy and surface gravity , the nightside and dayside atmospheres depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , and [ fig:4 ] clearly have different interior entropies .",

    "a comparison between the measured points and corresponding theoretical points for this p@xmath0 = 0.5 model is encouraging , particularly for the tres-1 data at 4.5 and 8.0 , but also for the hd189733b irs peak - up data point near 16 .",
    "the 24-point for hd209458b is within about 1-@xmath8 , but slightly below the theory .",
    "since these p@xmath0=0.5 models yield the lowest theoretical values for the contrast ratios among the set from 0.0 to 0.5 , for the hd209458b 24-point this may be the best we can do currently . for the hd189733b point at 16 , the entire p@xmath0 range studied would still be consistent to within the 1-@xmath8 range quoted ( see the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] ) , with perhaps only the p@xmath0 = 0.0 model mildly discounted , rendering problematic for this egp the constraint on the degree of heat redistribution from this one point alone . as fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] suggests , values of p@xmath0 of 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 do not fit the tres-1 data point at 4.5 to at least 2-@xmath8 , while values of p@xmath0 of 0.0 and 0.1 do not fit the tres-1 data point at 8.0 to the 2-@xmath8 level .",
    "the other values of p@xmath0 can not be excluded .",
    "hence , we conclude that while some heat redistribution by winds to the nightside is definitely indicated for tres-1 and hd209458b , the degree of redistribution is harder to constrain , with a slight bias towards the larger values of p@xmath0 .",
    "the steep slope from 4.5 to 8.0 is best explained by the rise to a peak near @xmath410 , which in our models is a natural consequence of the relative strength and positions of water bands longward of @xmath45.5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "note that without a large water abundance , none of the data nor their ratios would make collective sense .",
    "this was the conclusion of burrows , hubeny , & sudarsky ( 2005 ) , which we reconfirm here .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the 4.67 band of co is indicated by the depth of the 4.5-feature of tres-1 , but due to the fact that this irac-2 band measurement perforce sums over steeply rising fluxes in regions of the spectrum that bracket the 4.67 feature , and the fact that with reasonable abundances the band is saturated , almost nothing can be said about the co abundance ( burrows , hubeny , & sudarsky 2005 ) .",
    "we predict a rise from irac-2 to irac-1 for all our models , indicative of the peak we generically see just shortward of 4.0 .",
    "we also predict a slight peak around 10 , and a plateau from @xmath414 to 30 .",
    "the peak near 10 might be discernible for hd189733b using the full capability of _ spitzer_/irs .",
    "the predicted plateau seems suggested by the comparison between theory and data for the hd189733b 16-and hd209458b mips points , taken together , but mixing objects ( as we have been forced to do with only four data points ) is not very satisfying .",
    "we have calculated a p@xmath0 = 0.5 model for hd209458b with @xmath34solar metallicity and , contrary to the conclusion of fortney et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we find that the band contrast ratios are within @xmath45% of those with solar abundances .",
    "this is because , without clouds , the bond albedos are very low ( @xmath355% ) . since changing the metallicity does not change the total stellar light intercepted by the planet for a given planet radius , the characteristic atmospheric temperatures are similar .",
    "what is more , we find that the @xmath14 profiles are also similar , with the result that the fluxes and contrast ratios are little altered .",
    "we have not been able to trace the origin of the difference between our results for higher metallicities and those of fortney et al .",
    "however , we interpret the very weak metallicity dependence of the contrast ratios at secondary eclipse for egp models without clouds that we find theoretically to indicate that the metallicity may well be supersolar and large . however , by the same token , we conclude that the metallicity can not easily be constrained nor measured by secondary eclipse data alone .",
    "cloud models , which we expect may be relevant for hd209458b alone among the three egps ( fortney et al .",
    "2003 ; sudarsky , burrows , & hubeny 2003 ) , may well change this conclusion and variations in the c / o ratio , while we do not see any need at this time to invoke them to fit the four _ spitzer _ data points , are still of interest ( seager et al . 2005 ) .",
    "one way to significantly alter the planet / star contrast ratios is to introduce at altitude a strong absorber in the optical and near - uv , where the incident stellar flux can be large . in this way",
    ", the upper atmosphere is heated .",
    "the associated reradiated optical flux is also greater and the @xmath14 profile manifests a  stratospheric \" inversion ( hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky 2003 ) . since the mid - ir fluxes originate higher up in the atmosphere than where @xmath36@xmath41 , the associated brightness temperatures from 4 to 30 are also enhanced .",
    "the increase in the emergent fluxes in the optical and mid - ir leads to a corresponding suppression in the near - ir ( @xmath41 - 4 ) .",
    "this potential mechanism for altering our baseline predictions in the _ spitzer _ bands and for suppressing flux in the near - ir , particularly in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands , should be borne in mind .",
    "figure [ fig:14 ] , constructed from a theoretical model found in hubeny , burrows , & sudarsky ( 2003 ) , depicts an extreme version of this effect for p@xmath0 = 0 models of ogle - tr56b with ( red curve ) and without ( blue curve ) tio and vo in its upper atmosphere .",
    "in fact , we expect that tio and vo are both flushed out of the upper atmosphere by the coldtrap effect , but suppressing this effect allows us to make the general point .",
    "note that the bumps near 10 and 4 seen in our fiducial models ( figs .",
    "[ fig:10 ]  [ fig:12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) can be altered , shifted ( 4 ) , or muted ( 10 ) by this upper - atmosphere absorption effect , so if we fail to see these features as predicted interesting stratospheric or upper - atmosphere chemistry might be implied .",
    "conversely , the presence of these bumps will put useful limits on such upper - atmosphere absorbers .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , we employ the latest measurements of the transit radii of each of the three egps in determining the planet / star contrast levels",
    ". however , these radii , being transit radii that probe along the chord of the planet in the optical ( burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard 2003 ) , are not strictly the appropriate radii to use in determining the planet / star contrast ratios .",
    "they are close , but the total stellar energy intercepted by the planet depends upon wavelength and is different in the near - ir water bands , where the transit radius should be slightly larger than in the optical ( for hd209458b , by @xmath42 - 3% ; fortney et al .",
    "2003 ) . furthermore , planetary emission is from a radius that is not corrected for by the  transit radius effect . \" for hd20948b , this radius difference can be 8 - 10% ( burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard 2003 ) , while for tres-1 and hd189733b , due to the lower atmospheric temperatures and higher gravities the effect is smaller ( @xmath355% ) .",
    "the upshot is that the predicted flux ratios for hd209458b could be smaller by as much as @xmath415% , bringing the 24-mips point better in line with our prediction , but introducing further ambiguities into predictions at all wavelengths until the radius issue is resolved .",
    "no one doing theoretical secondary eclipse calculations has yet corrected for these subtle radius effects . moreover ,",
    "even the measured transit radii retain a residual ambiguity due to the systematic uncertainty in the stellar radius , which could easily be 5 - 10% .",
    "knutson et al . (",
    "2006 ) argue that measurements of the star , constraints of stellar evolution theory ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) , and the detailed fits to the hst / stis transit measurements together yield a transit radius for hd209458b with an error of only @xmath42% .",
    "perhaps , but our same concerns apply to tres-1 and hd189733b .",
    "in sum , ambiguities in the appropriate radii to employ in comparing secondary eclipse data with theory remain and slightly compromise their interpretation .",
    "however , that the data and theory we have developed here correspond as well as they do is gratifying .",
    "in fact , the theory does a good job fitting the four secondary eclipse data points ( fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) , whatever the ambiguities .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for redistribtuion to the nightside , particularly for tres-1 and hd209458b , ( though its specific magnitude remains to be determined ) , and the presence of h@xmath40o and of co is strongly indicated .",
    "moreover , we find that the metallicity dependence of cloud - free models is quite mild , but that ambiguities in the radii remain to slightly compromise the interpretation of the data .",
    "due to the greater sensitivity in the irac bands to variations in p@xmath0 ( figs . [ fig:5 ] - [ fig:8 ] ) , such data have greater potential to determine the degree(s ) of redistribution . data off secondary eclipse at other phase angles , and particularly in irac-4 ( figs .",
    "[ fig:10 ] - [ fig:12 ] ) , would further constrain the models , but the most propitious phase angles in this regard are larger than 90@xmath6 and , hence , will prove very difficult to measure . however , jwst , with its two to three orders - of - magnitude greater sensitivity in the mid - ir , will be able to measure a large fraction of the planetary light curves . in the shorter term , data , or even upper limits , at the 14 other anticipated _ spitzer _",
    "band points are anxiously awaited .",
