    "for example , the results can be utilized to describe formation of molecular nanowires on surfaces , where molecules interact via van der waals interactions and form hydrogen bonds when coming into contact . in the model , such situation could be accounted for by an interaction profile @xmath14 with strong attractive interaction @xmath179 at contact distance @xmath1 and a smoothly decreasing , weaker attractive part for @xmath180 . also , based on experiences in other contexts , @xcite the explicit exact expressions for",
    "the density functionals should allow one to faithfully study the kinetics of wire formation by employing time - dependent density functional theory .",
    "similarly , our results may be helpful in the future to treat diffusion of molecules through nanopores or membrane channels .",
    "our derivation of a fundamental measure form of the hard - rod lattice gas with contact interaction enables a straightforward extension to higher dimensions",
    ". this should be useful to account for transitions between different phases in corresponding systems , which generally resemble nematic ( and other ) phases of liquid crystals.@xcite it has been shown @xcite for athermal hard - rod lattice gases ( @xmath21 ) that extensions to higher dimensions are a powerful means to treat corresponding phase transitions . up to now , we did not succeed to identify fundamental measure forms for general nearest - neighbor - range interactions @xmath14 .",
    "however , there seem to be other possibilities of extensions , which become exact under dimensional reduction",
    ". these will be explored elsewhere .",
    "considering the core in the derivation of the distribution of microstates , it is important to realize that the procedure can in principle be extended to interactions of longer range covering several rod lengths . for a given range @xmath18 , the exclusion constraint leads to a natural decomposition of the set @xmath82 into ranges covering the lattice sites @xmath181 ( first range ) , @xmath182 ( second range ) , and so on . in each of these ranges at",
    "most one occupation number can be equal to one .",
    "the total number of ranges that need to be taken into account is @xmath183 , where @xmath184 denotes the integer ceiling division , i.e.  the smallest integer larger than @xmath185 .",
    "accordingly , we would need to consider higher - order correlators @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , specifies the location of the occupied site in the @xmath188th range as in sec .",
    "[ subsec : jointprob ] .",
    "the distribution of microstates can then be expressed in term of these correlators @xmath186 and the densities @xmath37 . by equating with the boltzmann formula for simple configurations ,",
    "relations between the @xmath186 and the @xmath37 eventually can be obtained , which need to be solved for expressing the @xmath186 in terms of the @xmath37 .    by working out the long - range asymptotic behavior of correlation functions it should be possible also to study the occurrence and behavior of widom - fisher lines.@xcite these lines separate regions in the temperature - density and temperature - pressure planes , where in one region the pair correlation decays monotonically , while in the other region it oscillates with decaying amplitude .",
    "the abrupt change in the behavior at the lines takes place without any singularities in the thermodynamics . in the original work",
    ", @xcite transition lines were calculated for a one - dimensional continuum fluid with square - well interaction potential and a lattice fluid as considered in this work , corresponding to hard rods of size @xmath189 with first - neighbor coupling .",
    "access to the correlation properties of systems with larger @xmath1 and interactions of longer range may allow one to gain deeper insight into general features of these lines .",
    "let us finally note that the rod length defines a length scale independent of the lattice spacing , which implies that a continuum limit of the results should be accessible .",
    "this , the possible extension to larger interaction ranges , and evaluations of widom - fisher lines open new and challenging possibilities for further investigations .",
