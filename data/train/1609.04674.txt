    "most of what is known about the mechanisms producing stellar flares is informed by the detailed observations of flares on the sun .",
    "solar flares occur in close proximity to active regions ( ars ) , which are effectively localized magnetic field regions of 1 - 2 kg strength .",
    "loops from these ars extend into the solar corona ; as the footpoints of these loops are jostled by solar convective motions , they are twisted and distorted until magnetic reconnection occurs near the loop tops @xcite .",
    "the reconnection event is accompanied by a sudden release of energy , resulting in the acceleration of electrons and ions in these loops up to mev energies , which stream both towards and away from the sun , emitting nonthermal radio ( gyrosynchrotron ) and x - ray emission ( particularly at the loop footpoints ) as they move @xcite .",
    "these energetic particles stream down to the loop footpoints and deposit substantial energy to the lower solar atmosphere ( the chromosphere ) , `` evaporating '' and heating plasma from this region to fill the flaring loop(s ) with plasma @xcite . in the `` decay '' phase of the flare , the thermal emission dominates the x - ray emission , although in some large solar flares a nonthermal x - ray component may persist as a continuous source of energy @xcite .",
    "young stars and stars in close binary systems rotate much more rapidly than the sun , and , in consequence , have much stronger levels of magnetic activity , i.e. , greater coverage by starspots and ars , stronger chromospheric and coronal emission , and more frequent and powerful flares @xcite .",
    "there is a large disparity between the extremes of solar and stellar flares : while the largest solar flares have radiated energies exceeding 10@xmath10 erg , and maximum coronal temperatures of a few tens of mk @xcite , large stellar flares can be 10@xmath11 times more energetic , with coronal temperatures around 100 mk @xcite and large energetic releases up to 10@xmath12 erg @xcite . a 2008 flare of the nearby 30 - 300 myr old m dwarf flare star ev lac @xcite had a lower limit on energetic release of 6@xmath6 10@xmath9 erg .",
    "@xcite found x - ray flares on very young low mass stars to range up to 2@xmath610@xmath7 erg , and @xcite found flares from active binary systems to range up to 10@xmath12 erg .",
    "the interpretation of these stellar flaring events assumes that the same physical processes are at work as in the solar case , as confirmed by multiwavelength observations of plasma heating and particle acceleration in stellar flares @xcite . the largest stellar flares , with their extreme parameters of temperature and energy release , clearly test this correspondence .",
    "initial suppositions of a transition from solar - stellar flare scaling laws has come from the work of @xcite , but those data could not determine flare temperatures accurately .",
    "dg cvn ( gj 3789 ) is an interesting , albeit poorly studied member of this class of nearby , very young low - mass stars .",
    "it is noted as having an unusually active chromosphere @xcite and corona @xcite , as well as being one of the brightest nearby stellar radio emitters @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies confirm that it exhibits optical flares and sub - day rotational modulation @xcite , with a measured photospheric line broadening of 51 km / s @xcite indicative of a very short rotational period of @xmath13 8 hours .",
    "dg  cvn is a binary , as revealed by the double - lined spectrum noted in @xcite .",
    "adaptive optics imaging of dg cvn @xcite reveal it to be a close ( 0.2@xmath14 separation ) visual binary system , with two components of near - equal optical brightness ( @xmath15v @xmath4 0.3 ) and spectral types of m4ve .",
    "the distance to dg  cvn , from a large study of the trigonometric parallaxes and kinematics of nearby active stars , is 18 pc , with a space motion consistent with the system being a member of the population of 30-myr old stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "they quote a combined systemic @xmath16 and @xmath17 , from which ( by dividing @xmath18 equally between the two components ) a luminosity @xmath19=@xmath20 is obtained .",

    "* ) suggests a radius of about 0.4 r@xmath22 .",

    "* ) and we adopt r@xmath23=0.4r@xmath22 in this paper . in young stars , accretion episodes can provide an additional optical and x - ray signature to that expected from magnetic reconnection @xcite .",

    "on 2014 april 23 , one of the 2 stars in this system flared to a level bright enough ( @xmath43.4 @xmath6 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath27 @xmath28 ) in the 15 - 100 kev band that it triggered the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) ; described in @xcite .",
    "two minutes later , after swift had slewed to point in the direction of this source , the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) commenced observing this flare .",
    "these observations , as well as supporting ground - based optical and radio observations , continued ( intermittently ) for about 20 days and yielded a fascinating case history of this colossal event , the decay of which took more than two weeks in the soft x - ray band , and included a number of smaller superimposed secondary flares ( see fig .

    "the source location was in the bat field of view ( fov ) starting from t-1627 s , but there was no detectable emission until approximately t@xmath2940 s. after the trigger occurred , a slew placed the star in the apertures of the narrow - field instruments ( xrt and uvot ) , for 210 seconds on target before an observing constraint led to a slew to another target . however , dg cvn remained in the bat fov during this new pointing , until t+892 s. the mask - weighted lightcurve shows a single peak from @xmath4t0 - 40 s to 120 s and another weaker peak from @xmath4t0 + 200 to t0 + 240 s. bat spectra from 15 to 150 kev were extracted for the time intervals from t0 - 30 s to t0 + 72 s and from t0 + 123 to t0 + 328 s ( the latter to match the initial xrt observation ) , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "the xrt @xcite began observing dg cvn 117 seconds after the bat trigger .",
    "the online xrt product generator @xcite was utilised to produce the xrt light curve and extract the time - sliced spectra .",
    "this tool was used to account for pile - up and to apply all necessary corrections . at the time of writing , the software version used by the generator was heasoft 6.18 , with the calibration file release of 2016 - 01 - 21 .    for the initial snapshot of data , immediately following the bat trigger , the data were collected in windowed timing ( wt ) mode , due to the large count rate .",
    "observations between 4.5 and 50 ks after the trigger occurred using a combination of both wt and photon counting ( pc ) modes ; all later data were then taken in pc mode .",
    "the uvot @xcite began observing dg cvn , 108 s after the swift - bat trigger , t0 , with a 10s settling exposure .",
    "after a 4.2 ks gap in xrt / uvot observations , uvot observed in all 7 uvot filters with regular cadence until 1.7ms after the trigger .",
    "the uvot returned to the field 4 months later ( 11ms after the trigger ) to determine the quiesent level in the optical and uv filters . upon examination of the initial images we found that all the white exposures were saturated and therefore no futher exposures were taken later than 11.5ks .",
    "the @xmath30  settling image and the first two @xmath31  and @xmath32  exposures were also saturated .",
    "observations continued from 74ks for the @xmath30 , @xmath31  and @xmath32  filters in hardware mode since the quiescent @xmath33  band magnitude for dg cvn is close to the brightness limit of the standard uvot image mode . in this case a smaller portion of the detector was read out , reducing the frame time of each exposure from 11 ms to 3 ms and enabling brighter objects to be observed .    to perform the photometry for non - saturated images , we used a region of 5@xmath14 radius to extract the source counts and background counts were extracted using two circular regions of radius 12@xmath14 from a blank area of sky situated near to the source position .",

    ". the @xmath33/@xmath34  color temperature of about 6000 k is evidence that increased conundruum continuum emission dominates the optical brightness increase in the f2 event .",
    "the swift @xmath102  point which falls near the peak of f2 , but shortly afterward , can place some constraints on the relative contribution of blackbody versus balmer continuum expected at these short wavelengths .",
    "no extinction correction has been applied here , but due to the proximity of the star and its location out of the galactic plane this will be negligible . at t0 + 11753 to t0 + 11761 , the flux ratio of @xmath102/@xmath33  is 1.2@xmath610@xmath120 / 1.5@xmath610@xmath120 = 0.8 . at t0 + 16951 , the ratio of @xmath102/@xmath33  is 4.2@xmath610@xmath120 / 4.6@xmath610@xmath120 = 0.9 .",

    "this indicates that 10 times more emission is needed to account for the flux in the @xmath102bandpass if a 6000 k blackbody ( or any spectrum that is similar shape to a 6000 k blackbody ) is extrapolated to @xmath1232030  . in the impulsive beam heating phase of the f11 , f12 , and f13 models from @xcite , the average values of the continuum flux ratio 2030/5500   are 1.8 , 2.0 , and 3.1 for these models respectively .",
    "so a ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 ( even given a  20% uncertainty from comparing satellite and ground - based broadband data ) can be used as a strong constraint on heating models .",

    "the megaflare described by k13 was similar to the situation presented here in that a second large flare occurred during the decay phase of a large , @xmath1246 magnitude , flare brightening on the nearby flare star yz  cmi . while the yz  cmi events did not have coverage by high energy satellites",
    ", they did have comprehensive blue - optical spectrophotometric coverage , which enabled several inferences to be drawn about the behavior of the lower stellar atmosphere .",

    "the @xmath33/@xmath34  ratio changed from 1.0 to 1.1 indicating that the broad continuum covering the @xmath33  and @xmath34  bands remained relatively flat , due to the brightness of the decay emission that was dominated by the conundruum continuum component .",
    "the appearance of a very blue spectrum ( t@xmath126 @xmath4 15,000 k ; table 9 of k13 ) in these secondary flares had a small effect on the @xmath33/@xmath34  value of the total ( decay + secondary flare ) emission .    invoking the solar analogy of a two ribbon flare which was applied to the megaflare @xcite , the relevant flaring areas for the dg cvn superflare are the following : +    1 .   the area of the decaying emission before f2 occurred . this area could be decaying ribbon emission from the bff event , and is likely dominated by conundruum continuum emission and balmer continuum emission ( where the area fraction occupied by these two components are roughly equal ) . or it could be decaying emission from loops ignited at earlier times in f2 .",

    "it is possible that the lifetime of the hot blackbody emission in each newly formed flare kernel is much less than the f2 event duration of @xmath4 3600 s and thus the blue spectra from each burst decay quickly leaving bright conundruum emission to dominate the flare energy over a long timescale . to obtain a flare footpoint area ,",
    "we assume the following : 1 ) the area of the newly formed flare emission is approximately equal to the area of the conundruum continuum emission ( however , the loops producing conundruum and loops producing hot blackbody emission may have different heating sources ) ; 2 ) the conundruum emission can be approximated by blackbody radiation ( the emissivity process(es ) that give rise to the conundruum emission are not yet well understood ; see k13 ) ; 3 ) the h@xmath63 , he i 5876 and na i d line contributions to the @xmath34-band are small relative to the continuum ( at most 10% is attributed to h@xmath63 in the gradual phase of other large flares ; hp1991 and k13 ) . using t@xmath46000 k , for the peak of f2 , we use the @xmath33/@xmath34  band ratio to determine that @xmath130=@xmath131 0.14 ( see table  [ tbl : footpoint ] ) . the density of the plasma producing the conundruum should be investigated with radiative - hydrodynamic  multithread \" models .",

    "they used scalings between uv radiated energy and x - ray energy , and a further scaling of x - ray flux to proton flux , to model the response of a terrestrial atmosphere to the impingement of the uv flare photons only or the flare photons along with the mev energy protons .",
    "we note that the comparison of the @xmath34  band radiated energy of f2 on dg  cvn to the great flare on ad  leo in our figure  [ fig : renergy ] reveals f2 to be a factor of @xmath127 20 larger . the energetic protons which were modelled removed the ozone layer , on timescales of about 2 years , and the recovery time of the planetary atmosphere was a few decades .",
    "these effects coupled with the esimated occurrence rate of even larger events suggests that there might be a permanent erosion of the ozone layer .",
    "one critical open question in this area is whether the scalings observed in solar eruptive events between photons and particles holds during stellar events .",
    "a more recent paper on the effects of stellar flares on exoplanetary atmospheres @xcite determined that planets around very active stars would likely never achieve a steady state due to the frequent photon bombardment of the exoplanetary atmosphere from stellar flares .",
    "@xcite considered the transport of ionizing radiation in terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres , and found that while a thick atmosphere can protect the planetary surface from incident x - rays and @xmath284-rays , up to 4% of the incident ionizing radiation received at the surface in the 2000 - 3200   wavelength range comes from atmospheric transmission and reprocessing of the high energy radiation .",
    "as the two flares reported here have peak x - ray luminosities more than several hundred times larger than the quiescent values , any irradiation of a planetary atmosphere would increase temporarily by the same large factor .",
    "the effect of such large variations in the stellar ionizing flux may be significant , especially early in the life of the star and planetary system .",
    "the previous studies examining the impact of stellar flares on exoplanet atmospheres , like @xcite and @xcite , used only uv observations , ignoring the potential increase in uv emission incident on the planet due to high energy photons in the manner described in @xcite . hence they are underestimates at best of the impact of these flares on exoplanet atmospheric chemistry .",
    "the flaring star which produced these immense energetic releases is not solitary , which raises the question of whether the companion could have any impact on the existence of these superflares .",
    "the dg  cvn system is a binary , with the two stars separated by @xmath44 au . at their young age the components",
    "are not yet tidally synchronized , precluding an origin in increased magnetic activity from tidal interaction akin to that seen in rs  cvn or by  dra systems .",
    "recent studies of m dwarf - white dwarf binary systems suggest that even non - interacting close binaries ( @xmath285 au separation ) may have a higher flare rate than single stars @xcite , although @xcite found no correlation between x - ray luminosity and orbital period for spectroscopic binaries in the hyades with periods greater than 10 days . whether this can be related to dynamical interaction within a circumbinary disk compared to the evolution of a circumstellar disk",
    "is speculative .",
    "however , since single m dwarf flare stars are also capable of producing stellar superflares with roughly similar characteristics ( table  [ tbl : compare ] ) this suggests that the binarity is not a strong factor .",
    "we presented a detailed study of two of the most energetic flare events seen on a young low mass star .",
    "in addition to measurements made for each flare event , we used the properties of the second flare f2 to infer some of the properties for bff .",
    "the results confirmed the basic flare scenario for hyperactive stars as for solar flares , and revealed evidence of departures of trends between the temperatures and emission measures of the highest temperature stellar flares compared with lower temperature solar flares .",
    "the object , dg  cvn , has been relatively uncharacterized for its flaring and extreme magnetic activity and we hope that this report will spur additional studies .",
    "based on the flare properties described in this paper , we expect the existence of very strong magnetic fields in the photosphere .",
    "starspot modelling should confirm the nature of starspot sizes implied by the flare footpoint modelling .",
    "uncertainties in the rotation period and @xmath286 mentioned in the introduction are likely the result of the previously unrecognized binary nature of the system .",
    "while x - ray flares from stars are commonly known , observations with swift have revealed that stellar flares can be bright enough to trigger the bat with their intense hard x - ray ( @xmath115 kev ) emission .",
    "these events reveal the nature of magnetic reconnection processes occurring in a regime vastly different from the sun , yet exhibiting continuity with solar events . supporting data from both space- and",
    "ground - based observatories enable more constraints on the extremes of energetics and plasma parameters .",
    "in contrast with the claim of nonthermal emission from the superflare on ii  peg reported by @xcite , for the dg  cvn event the possibility of a nonthermal interpretation is confronted with constraints on kinetic energy and photospheric flare area provided by radio and optical observations , respectively .",
    "since the nonthermal interpretation is disfavored in the dg  cvn flares because of constraints from the radio and optical data , the ii  peg nonthermal interpretation is in doubt .",
    "the extreme nature of the flare temperature of bff , coupled with results from other extreme flares , suggest that the scaling between solar and stellar flare temperatures and emission measures exhibits a flattening at high temperatures .",
    "the opportunity these flares present to confirm this flattening by using spectroscopically derived temperatures is important and may reveal departures from canonical solar flare behavior .    planets around m dwarfs will likely experience millions of these kinds of superflares during their infancy .",
    "this pair of well - studied flares on m dwarfs should be used to provide updated constraints on the impact of flare radiation on close - in terrestrial exoplanets .",
    "this confirms the conclusion reached for ev lac that the  habitable zone \" @xmath4 0.1 au from a young m dwarf star is likely inimicable to life : the flare peak luminosity in the goes ( 1.5 - 8 kev ) band would be equivalent to an x60,000,000 flare .",
    "if the energetic proton fluxes and coronal mass ejection energies scale with the radiated flare energy , the impact upon the atmosphere and magnetosphere of any hypothetical terrestrial planet would be catastrophic .",
