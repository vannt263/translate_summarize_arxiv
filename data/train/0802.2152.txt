    "since the pioneering work of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite , which proved that the entropy of black hole is proportional to the area of its horizon in the early 1970s , the research of the black hole thermodynamics has greatly improved .",
    "especially , it was found that if the surface gravity of the black hole is considered to be the temperature and the outer horizon area is considered to be the entropy , four laws of the black hole thermodynamics , which correspond with the four laws of the elementary thermodynamics , has been established  @xcite .",
    "recently , there are several geometric approaches  @xcite to the black hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the geometric description of the equilibrium thermodynamics comes from ruppeiner geometry based on the metric of the thermodynamic state space : entropy metric and others including weinhold metric  @xcite .",
    "however , the results depends on how to choose the metric .",
    "very recently , ruppeiner has discussed on a systematic discussion of how to make the correct choice of a metric  @xcite .",
    "also , ruppeiner has demonstrated several limiting results matching extremal kerr - newman black hole thermodynamics to the two dimensional fermi gas  @xcite , showing that this connection to a 2d model is consistent with the membrane paradigm of black holes  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "2d dilaton gravity has been used in various situations as an effective description of 4d gravity after a black hole in string theory has appeared @xcite . in particular , thermodynamics of this black hole",
    "has been analyzed by several authors @xcite .",
    "another 2d theories , which were originated from the jackiw - teitelboim ( jt ) theory @xcite , have been also studied @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced the 2d dilaton gravity approach , which completely preserves the thermodynamics of 4d black hole  @xcite .",
    "we have obtained that the 2d curvature scalar shows the features of extremal , davies and minimum temperature points of rn black hole , clearly .",
    "actually , since the heat capacity is inversely proportional to the 2d curvature scalar , we expect that the 2d curvature could show interesting thermodynamic points clearly .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with the issue of geometric approach by analyzing the rn - ads black hole , which provides two different ensembles : canonical ensemble for fixed - charge case and grand canonical ensemble for fixed - potential case  @xcite .",
    "since these are independent of each other , one can not mix them by legendre transformation .",
    "hence , we have to calculate two ruppeiner curvatures for different ensembles . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly recapitulate the rn - ads black hole thermodynamics . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate different ruppeiner curvatures based on fixed - charge and fixed - potential ensembles . in sec .",
    "iv , alternatively , we propose the 2d curvature scalar , which shows the features of extremal , davies and minimum temperature points of the rn - ads black hole , clearly . in sec .",
    "v , we point out the different thermodynamic behaviors between ruppeiner geometry and 2d dilaton gravity in the thermodynamics of black holes .",
    "finally , discussions are devoted to sec .",
    "we start with the four - dimensional action @xmath0\\ ] ] with @xmath1 the curvature radius of ads@xmath2 spacetimes .",
    "hereafter we shall adopt planck units of @xmath3 .",
    "the solutions to equations of motion lead to the rn - ads black hole whose metric is given by @xmath4 with the metric function @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "here , @xmath8 denotes @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the reduced mass becomes the adm mass ( @xmath10 ) and the charge parameter becomes the charge ( @xmath11 ) when choosing planck units .",
    "then , the inner ( @xmath12 ) and the outer ( @xmath13 ) horizons are obtained from the condition of @xmath14 . using these horizons , the mass and charge",
    "are expressed by @xmath15,~q^2(r_+,r_-)=r_+r_-\\bigg[1+\\frac{r_+^3-r_-^3}{l^2(r_+-r_-)}\\bigg].\\ ] ]    first , let us consider the case of fixed - charge ensemble . for the rn - ads black hole  @xcite ,",
    "the relevant thermodynamic quantities are given by the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath16 , adm mass @xmath17 , and hawking temperature @xmath18 @xmath19,~ t_q(r_+,q)= \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\bigg [ \\frac{1}{r_+}-\\frac{q^2}{r_+^3}+\\frac{3r_+}{l^2}\\bigg].\\ ] ] in this case that the horizon is degenerate ( @xmath20 ) , we have an extremal black hole with @xmath21 . in general",

    "here we observe the local minimum @xmath27 at @xmath28 ( schwarzschild - ads black hole ) , in addition to the zero temperature @xmath29 at @xmath30(extremal rn black hole ) and the local maximum @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( davies point of rn black hole ) .",
    "it seems to be a combination of the rn and schwarzschild - ads black holes .    here",

    "we consider the thermal stability of a black hole .",
    "the local stability is usually determined by the positive sign of heat capacity by considering evaporation and absorbing processes of a black hole , even for an exceptional case of the kerr - newman black hole  @xcite .",
    "for example , the heat capacity of the schwarzschild black hole is @xmath42 , which means that this isolated black hole is not in equilibrium in asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "based on the local stability of heat capacity , the rn - ads black holes of @xmath43 can be split into small stable black hole with @xmath44 being in the region of @xmath45 , intermediate unstable black hole with @xmath46 in the region of @xmath47 , and large stable black hole with @xmath44 in the region of @xmath48 .        on the other hand , for fixed - potential @xmath49 ensemble  @xcite , we have the mass and hawking temperature @xmath50,~ t_{\\phi}(r_+,\\phi)=",

    "furthermore , if we compare fig . 2 for @xmath43 with fig . 3 for @xmath56 , we could find that @xmath57 displays no singular behavior at the singular points @xmath58 of @xmath59 .",
    "hence we must separate the fixed - potential case from the fixed - charge one .",
    "another observation on the geometric description of the equilibrium thermodynamics comes from ruppeiner geometry based on a metric on the thermodynamic state space  @xcite @xmath61 where the ruppeiner metric @xmath62 and the weinhold metric @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 in this case , we use the ruppeiner metric as @xmath65 whose form is given by @xmath66    we observe the important relation @xmath67 its determinant takes the form @xmath68= - \\frac{2\\pi}{s } \\frac{(1-\\frac{\\pi q^2}{s}-\\frac{3s}{\\pi l^2})}{(1-\\frac{\\pi q^2}{s}+\\frac{3s}{\\pi l^2})^2}\\ ] ] one ruppeiner curvature is given by  @xcite @xmath69 in this work , we use the computer program _ mathematica _ 6.0 and _ general relativity , einstein & all _ package ( great.m ) @xcite for the calculations of all ruppeiner curvatures .",
    "we observe that the curvature diverges in the extremal limit of @xmath70 .",

    "<S> we study the geometric approach to the black hole thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric description of the equilibrium thermodynamics comes from ruppeiner geometry based on a metric on the thermodynamic state space . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the reissner - nordstrm - ads ( rn - ads ) black hole which provides two different ensembles : canonical ensemble for fixed - charge case and grand canonical ensemble for fixed - potential case . </S>",
    "<S> two cases are independent and can not be mixed into each other . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we calculate different ruppeiner curvatures for two ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> however , we could not find the consistent behaviors of ruppeiner curvature corresponding to those of heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we propose the curvature scalar in the 2d dilaton gravity approach which shows the features of extremal , davies and minimum temperature points of rn - ads black hole , clearly . </S>"
