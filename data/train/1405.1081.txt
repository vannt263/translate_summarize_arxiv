    "( 0.2,2.8 ) ;    adaptive filtering techniques play a prominent part in signal processing .",
    "they cope with time - varying or non - stationary signals and systems .",
    "the rationale of these methods is to optimize parameters of variable filters , according to adapted cost functions working on error signals .",
    "the appropriate choice of cost functions , that encode a priori information on the system under study , should be balanced with the tractability of the adaptation . while traditional adaptive algorithms resort to least squares minimization",
    ", they may be sensitive to outliers , and may not directly promote simple filters ( well - behaved , with concentrated coefficients ) , especially when the filter length is not well known .    certain systems , for instance transmission channels , behave parsimoniously .",
    "they are modeled by sparse impulse response filters with a few large taps , most of the others being small .",
    "several designs have thus turned toward cost functions promoting filter sparsity @xcite .",
    "recently , developments around proximity operators @xcite with signal processing applications @xcite have allowed performance improvements . for instance , @xcite allow sparsity promotion with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , quasi - norms , respectively , via time - varying soft - thresholding operators .",
    "improvements reside in convergence speed acceleration or gains in signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "these developments are generally performed directly in the signal domain .",
    "sparsity may additionally be present in signals .",
    "choosing an appropriate transformed domain could , when applied appropriately @xcite , ease the efficiency of adaptive filters @xcite .",
    "such transforms include filter banks @xcite or redundant wavelets @xcite . the usefulness of sparsity - promoting loss functions or shrinkage functions in structured data denoising or deconvolution is well documented @xcite .",
    "geophysical signal processing @xcite is a field where dealing with sparsity , or at least energy concentration , both in the system filter and the data domain , is especially beneficial .",
    "the aim of seismic data analysis is to infer the subsurface structure from seismic wave fields recorded through land or marine acquisitions . in reflection",
    "seismology , seismic waves , generated by a close - to - impulsive source , propagate through the subsurface medium .",
    "they travel downwards , then upwards , reflected by geological interfaces , convolved by earth filters .",
    "they account for the unknown relative distances and velocity contrasts between layers and they are affected by propagation - related distortions .",
    "a portion of the wave fields is finally recorded near the surface by arrays of seismometers ( geophones or hydrophones ) . in marine acquisition , hydrophones are towed by kilometer - long streamers .",
    "signals of interest , named primaries , follow wave paths depicted in dotted , dashed and solid blue in fig .",
    "[ fig_marine_seismic_reflection_multiple ] .",
    "although the contributions are generally considered linear , several types of disturbances , structured or more stochastic , affect the relevant information present in seismic data .",
    "since the data recovery problem is under - determined , geophysicists have developed pioneering sparsity - promoting techniques .",
    "for instance , robust , @xmath3-promoted deconvolution @xcite or complex wavelet transforms @xcite still pervade many areas of signal processing .",
    "we address one of the most severe types of interferences : secondary reflections , named multiples , corresponding to seismic waves bouncing between layers @xcite , as illustrated with red dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_marine_seismic_reflection_multiple ] .",
    "these reverberations share waveform and frequency contents similar to primaries , with longer propagation times . from the standpoint of geological information interpretation",
    ", they often hide deeper target reflectors .",
    "for instance , the dashed - red multiple path may possess a total travel time comparable with that of the solid - blue primary . their separation is thus required for accurate subsurface characterization .",
    "a geophysics industry standard consists of model - based multiple filtering .",
    "one or several realistic templates of a potential multiple are determined off - line , based on primary reflections identified in above layers .",
    "for instance , the dashed - red path may be approximately inferred from the dashed - blue , and then adaptively filtered for separation from the solid - blue propagation .",
    "their precise estimation is beyond the scope of this work , we suppose them given by prior seismic processing or modeling . as template modeling is partly inaccurate  in delay , amplitude and frequency  templates should be adapted in a time - varying fashion before being subtracted from the recorded data . resorting to several templates and",
    "weighting them adaptively , depending on the time and space location of seismic traces , helps when highly complicated propagation paths occur .",
    "increasing the number of templates is a growing trend in exploration .",
    "meanwhile , inaccuracies in template modeling , complexity of time - varying adaptation combined with additional stochastic disturbances require additional constraints to obtain geophysically - sound solutions .",
    "we propose a methodology for primary / multiple adaptive separation based on approximate templates .",
    "this framework addresses at the same time structured reverberations and a more stochastic part .",
    "namely , let @xmath6 denote the time index for the observed seismic trace @xmath7 , acquired by a given sensor . we assume , as customary in seismic , an additive model of contributions : @xmath8 the unknown signal of interest ( primary , in blue ) and the sum of undesired , secondary reflected signals ( different multiples , in red ) are denoted , respectively , by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "other unstructured contributions are gathered in the noise term @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that several approximate templates accounting for multiples are available .",
    "as the above problem is undetermined , additional constraints should be devised .",
    "we specify sparsity and slow - variation requirements on primaries and adaptive filters . in section  [ sec : related - work ] , we analyze related works and specify the novelty of the proposed methodology . to the authors knowledge , the formulation of this template - based restoration problem in a nonstationary context , taking into account noise , sparsity , slow adaptive filter variation , along with constraints on filters is unprecedented , especially in the field of seismic processing .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the transformed linear model incorporating the templates with adaptive filtering . in section [ sec : var - formulation ] , we formulate a generic variational form for the problem .",
    "section [ sec : algo ] describes the primal - dual proximal formulation .",
    "the performance of the proposed method is assessed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we detail the chosen optimization criteria and provide a comparison with different types of frames .",
    "the methodology is first evaluated on a realistic synthetic data model , and finally tested and applied to an actual seismic data - set .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this work improves upon @xcite by taking into account several multiple templates .",
    "part of it was briefly presented in @xcite , by incorporating an additional noise into the generic model , and by introducing alternative norms in multiple selection objective criteria . here , the approach is extended .",
    "in particular , the problem is completely reformulated as a constrained minimization problem , in order to simplify the determination of data - based parameters , as compared with our previous regularized approach involving hyper - parameters .",
    "primary / multiple separation is a long standing problem in seismic",
    ". published solutions are weakly generic , and often embedded in a more general processing work - flow .",
    "levels of prior knowledge  from the shape of the seismic source to partial geological information  greatly differ depending on data - sets .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent accounts on broad processing issues , including shortcomings of standard @xmath12-based methods .",
    "the latter are computationally efficient , yet their performance decreases when traditional assumptions fail ( primary / multiple decorrelation , weak linearity or stationarity , high noise levels ) .",
    "we focus here on recent sparsity - related approaches , pertaining to geophysical signal processing .",
    "the potentially parsimonious layering of the subsurface ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_marine_seismic_reflection_multiple ] ) suggests a modeling of primary reflection coefficients with generalized gaussian or cauchy distributions @xcite , having suitable parameters .",
    "the sparsity induced on seismic data has influenced deconvolution and multiple subtraction .",
    "progressively , the non - gaussianity of seismic traces has been emphasized , and contributed to the use of more robust norms @xcite for blind separation with independent component analysis ( ica ) for the signal of interest . as the true nature of seismic data distribution is still debated , including its stationarity @xcite , a handful of works have investigated processing in appropriate transformed domains .",
    "they may either stationarize @xcite or strengthen data sparsity .",
    "for instance , @xcite applies ica in a dip - separated domain . in @xcite , as well as in @xcite and",
    "subsequent works by the same group , a special focus is laid on separation in the curvelet domain .",
    "aforementioned works mostly deal with the mitigation of some @xmath12-norm on residuals , as remnant noise is traditionally considered gaussian in seismic .",
    "they are blended with @xmath13 objectives , solved through @xmath3 or hybrid @xmath3-@xmath12 approximations @xcite , resorting for instance to iteratively re - weighted least - squares method . recently , @xcite investigated the use of intermediate @xmath4-norms , with @xmath14 for instance , accounting for the `` super - gaussian nature of the seismic data due to the interfering fields '' , in the time domain . without further insights on precise modeling ,",
    "a more flexible framework is desirable to adapt to the nature of different seismic data , either in the direct or in a variety of transformed domains .",
    "data sparsity and noise gaussianity alone may not be sufficient to solve .",
    "additional constraints reduce the set of solutions , hopefully to geologically sounder ones .",
    "a first one is the locality of matched filters , traditional in standard multiple filtering .",
    "these can be modeled by finite impulse response ( fir ) operators .",
    "classical filter support limitations , down to one - tap @xcite , assorted with @xmath12 or @xmath3 criteria , are standard . in other seismic processing fields",
    ", @xcite has investigated mixed @xmath4-@xmath3 loss functions for deconvolution .",
    "recently , in @xcite the use of the nuclear norm is promoted for interpolation , combined with a standard @xmath12-norm penalty . yet , to the authors knowledge , no work in multiple removal has endeavored a more systematic study of variational and sparsity constraints on the adaptive filters , in the line of @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we propose a formulation allowing a family of penalties to be applied to the adaptive fir filters .",
    "since no metric is evidently more natural , such a flexibility is useful to assess different objectives .",
    "for instance , one might be interested in either well - preserving primaries , in mild noise cases , or robustly removing the multiples , in high contamination situations .",
    "indeed , when the perturbation is stronger in amplitude than the target signal , geophysicists are interested in uncovering even spoors of potential primaries , obfuscated by noise . as will be seen , the most appropriate norm depends on such contexts .",
    "finally , the propagation medium , as well as the modeled templates , carry continuous variations . with the seismic bandwidth ( up to ) , changes in signals are not as dramatic as in sharp images . consequently , we expect the adapted filters to exhibit bounded variations from one time index to the next one .",
    "this paper presents for the first time a relatively generic framework for multiple reflection filtering with ( _ i _ ) a noise prior , ( _ ii _ ) sparsity constraints on signal frame coefficients , ( _ iii _ ) slow variation modelling of the adaptive filters , and ( _ iv _ ) concentration metrics on the filters . with the development of recent optimization tools , multiple constraints",
    "can now be handled in a convenient manner . due to the diversity of focus points , paired with data observation",
    ", we choose here to decouple effects and to insist on ( _ iv _ ) , with respect to different flavors of 1d wavelet bases and frames @xcite , which appear as natural atoms for sparse descriptions of some physical processes , related to propagation and reflection of signals through media .",
    "the evaluation of the proposed multiple filtering algorithm on seismic data is not straightforward , for two main reasons .",
    "first , seismic processing work - flows are neither publicly available for benchmarks and are generally heavily parametrized .",
    "second , quality measures are not easy to devise since visual inspection is of paramount importance in geophysical data processing assessment .",
    "we thus compare the proposed approach with a state - of - the - art solution , previously benchmarked against industrial competitors @xcite .",
    "we assume that multiple templates are modeled at the temporal vicinity of actual disturbances , with standard geophysical assumptions on primaries .",
    "the multiple signal possesses a local behavior related to the geological context .",
    "hence , we assume the availability of @xmath15 templates @xmath16 , related to @xmath17 via a possibly non - causal linear model through a limited support relationship : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an unknown finite impulse response ( with @xmath20 tap coefficients ) associated with template @xmath21 and time @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 is its starting index ( @xmath24 corresponds to the causal case ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that the dependence w.r.t .",
    "the time index @xmath22 of the impulse responses implies that the filtering process is time variant , although it can be assumed slowly varying in practice .",
    "indeed , seismic waveforms evolve gradually with propagation depth , in contrast with steeper variations around contours in natural images .",
    "templates are generated with standard geophysical modeling based on the above primaries .",
    "the adaptive fir assumption is commonly adopted , and applied in partly overlapping , complementary time windows at different scales .",
    "the observation that adapted filters are ill - behaved , due to the band - pass nature of seismic data is well known , although rarely documented , motivating the need for filter coefficient control . defining vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 by : @xmath27^\\top,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]and block diagonal matrices @xmath28 of size @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are vectors of dimension @xmath20 such that @xmath32^\\top= & { \\small \\begin{bmatrix } r_j^{(-p ' ) } & \\cdots & r_j^{(0 ) } & 0 & \\cdots & &   0 \\\\ r_j^{(-p'+1 ) } & \\cdots &   &   r_j^{(0 ) } & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots   &   &   &   & \\\\",

    "we assume that the characteristics of the primary are appropriately described through a prior statistical model in a ( possibly redundant ) frame of signals , e.g. a wavelet frame @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath39 the vector of frame coefficients , and @xmath40 designates the associated analysis operator , we have @xcite : @xmath41 . in addition , we assume that @xmath42 is a realization of a random vector @xmath43 , the probability density function ( pdf ) of which is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45-\\infty,+\\infty\\right]}}$ ] is the associated potential , assumed to have a fast enough decay .    on the other hand , to take into account the available information on the unknown filter , it can be assumed that for all @xmath46 , @xmath47 is a realization of a random vector @xmath48 .",

    "the posterior distribution of @xmath57 conditionally to @xmath58 is then given by @xmath59    by resorting to an estimation of @xmath60 in the sense of the map ( maximum a posteriori ) , the problem can thus be formulated under the following variational form : @xmath61      for simplicity , we propose to adopt uniform priors for @xmath43 and @xmath51 by choosing for @xmath62 and @xmath63 indicator functions of closed convex sets .",

    "one of the potential advantages of such a constrained formulation is that it facilitates the choice of the related parameters with respect to the regularized approach which was investigated in some of our previous works @xcite ( this point will be detailed later on ) .",

    "function @xmath68 accounts for the noise statistics . in this work",
    ", the noise is assumed to be additive , zero - mean , white and gaussian .",
    "this leads to the quadratic form @xmath69 .",
    "the filters are assumed to be time varying .",
    "however , in order to ensure smooth variations along time , we propose to introduce constraint sets @xmath71 @xmath72 these constraints prevent strong variations of corresponding coefficients of the impulse response , estimated at two consecutive times .",
    "the bounds @xmath73 may depend on the shape of the expected filter . for example , its dependence on the coefficient index @xmath74 may enable a larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) difference for filter coefficients taking larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) values .",
    "moreover , some additional a priori information can be added directly on the vector of filter coefficients @xmath70 .",
