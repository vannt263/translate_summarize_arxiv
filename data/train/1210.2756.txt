    "dash - dotted and dash - double - dotted lines represent the both donor and acceptor transition dipoles fixed in the @xmath210-direction [ schematically shown in figure  [ fig : schematic](a ) in the main text ] and in the @xmath211-direction ( dipoles perpendicular to the graphene s plane ) , respectively .",
    "ete in the projection - averaged case is shown by solid lines .",
    "dashed lines represent the case where the _ summation _ is performed over the acceptor s dipole projections instead of averaging ( solid lines ) .",
    "this has to be done if the acceptor s dipole polarizability is isotropic , which is frequently the case for spherical semiconductor qds as fluorophores . for example , this is true for pbse qds , where the dipole polarizability is isotropic due to the presence of four degenerate @xmath212-valleys corresponding to the four equivalent @xmath213 directions in the face - centered cubic lattice of lead chalcogenides.@xcite within the analytical plasmon pole approximation , to substitute the averaging over acceptor s projections with summation it suffices to add an extra factor of 3 into eq .  ( [ matrix - pl ] ) in the main text .    for comparison ,",
    "the dependence of the frster ete ( i.e. , in the absence of graphene ) on dipole orientations is shown by black lines . in this case",
    ", the standard frster ete with @xmath214 is recovered . the slightly smaller frster radius , @xmath215 nm for the solid black line , than the one obtained for the suspended graphene ( @xmath145 nm ) ( figure  [ fig : ead_num_anl ] in the main text ) , is due to the sio@xmath216-induced dielectric screening ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "specific dipole orientations can lead to strong ete variations in the crossover region between frster - dominated and gp - dominated regimes .",
    "this behavior is due to the interference between the frster and gp contributions to et in the region where the magnitudes of these two contributions are comparable . in particular , the negative and positive interferences are seen for dipole projections fixed in @xmath211 and @xmath210-directions , respectively , at @xmath217  nm in figure  [ fig : ead_prjs ] .    at large donor - acceptor distances",
    ", a specific dipole orientation has no significant effect on ete , except for the overall numerical factor of the order of @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the donor with the transition dipole fixed in @xmath211-direction is twice as efficient in exciting gp than that with the dipole in @xmath210-direction.@xcite however , the @xmath211-dipole excites plasmons isotropically within the graphene plane , whereas the gp emission of @xmath210-dipole has a characteristic dipolar pattern [ see figure  [ fig : schematic](a ) in the main text ] , _ concentrated _ in the direction of the acceptor ( and also in the opposite direction ) .",
    "this results in the _ same _ power transfer in both cases , but with _ lower _ power losses in the case of the dipole fixed in the @xmath210-direction , which ultimately yields twice as high ete for @xmath210-dipoles than for @xmath211-dipoles .",
