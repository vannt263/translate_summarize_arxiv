    "in part i  @xcite , it has been shown for non - dissipative was considered , leading to a td hamiltonian @xmath1 , i.e. , non - conservative , but without dissipation . to distinguish this type of systems included in part i from the dissipative ones , in part",
    "ii we refer to the first type as ",
    "non - dissipative \" systems . ] systems that the information about the dynamics of a quantum system that can be obtained from the time - dependent ( td ) schrdinger equation ( se ) can equally well be obtained from the complex , quadratically nonlinear ( nl ) , riccati equation in the cases where the tdse possesses exact analytic solutions in the form of gaussian wave packets ( wps ) , i.e. , for hamiltonians that are at most quadratic or bilinear in position and momentum . as gaussian functions are completely determined by their maximum and their width , this led to the problem of solving the equations of motion for these two parameters .",
    "the maximum followed , according to ehrenfest s theorem , the classical equation of motion for the mean value of the position variable .",
    "the equation of motion for the wp s width was related with the complex td coefficient of the quadratic term in the exponent of the gaussian .",
    "this coefficient fulfilled a nl riccati equation .",
    "taking the square root of the inverse of the imaginary part of the variable fulfilling this riccati equation as a new variable , this was directly proportional to the wp s width and fulfilled a ( real ) nl so - called ermakov equation .",
    "this equation , together with the newtonian equation for the wp s maximum allowed to obtain a dynamical invariant even for an oscillator with @xmath2 , i.e. , in cases where the hamiltonian @xmath1 is no longer an invariant .    due to the nonlinearity of the riccati equation",
    ", the sensitivity to the choice of the initial conditions has been shown in  @xcite for the non - dissipative case .",
    "this and the consequences for physical properties of the system like ground state energy and tunnelling currents will become even more obvious in the dissipative case discussed in this paper . however , the first problem to be solved is to find an appropriate quantum mechanical description of the dissipative system compatible with the tdse used in the non - dissipative case .",
    "this is problematic as dissipative effects can not be included into the established classical lagrangian or hamiltonian formalism using canonical transformations and serving as a basis for the so - called canonical quantization .",
    "therefore , in section  [ section-2 ] some possibilities are shown to solve this problem . in order to preserve the canonical formalism and linear ( but",
    "possibly explicitly td ) hamiltonian operators after quantization , one has to allow for non - canonical ( classical ) or non - unitary ( quantum mechanical ) transformations .",
    "this has the disadvantage that physical and canonical variables have to be strictly distinguished and their interrelation has to be considered carefully .",
    "the other possibility is to keep the physical meaning of position and momentum variables and the corresponding operators like in standard quantum mechanics , but this can lead to nl and non - hermitian hamiltonian operators , implying nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) .",
    "the pleasant feature of these two types of approaches is that they can uniquely be linked via non - canonical ( classical ) or non - unitary ( quantum mechanical ) transformations , as is also shown in section  [ section-2 ] .    in the cases of interest , i.e. , hamiltonians that are at most quadratic or bilinear in the canonical variables , also for dissipative quantum mechanical systems , exact analytic solutions with the form of gaussian wps exist . for the different approaches",
    "the equations of motion for the maximum and width of these gaussians can be transformed consistently into each other .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to solve these equations for the case where the canonical variables are identical with the physical position and momentum , leading to the solution of a nlse .",
    "however , formal advantages of the linear canonical transformations can also be exploited to find analogies between the treatment of the non - dissipative systems and the dissipative ones , particularly with respect to the choice of the initial conditions , what will be shown in section  [ section-3 ] .    in section  [ section-4 ]",
    ", it is shown how the complex riccati equation obtained from the nlse can be linearized to a complex newtonian equation including a linear velocity dependent friction term .",
    "also the feynman kernel ( propagator ) for the dissipative case can be obtained in analogy to the one without dissipation . as in our first contribution  @xcite , in section  [ section-5 ] the wigner function is presented and it is shown that this quasi - distribution of probability , as in standard quantum theory , determines the probability densities in position and momentum space via the marginals .",
    "the explicit time - dependence of the position and momentum uncertainties , their correlations and uncertainty relations as well as the tunnelling currents and the quantum contributions to the energy , depending on the initial conditions , are given in section  [ section-6 ] .",
    "it is shown that different initial values , e.g. , no initial change in time of the width ( @xmath3 ) , or , no initial correlation of position and momentum uncertainties ( @xmath4=0 $ ] ) lead to different results and therefore different values for the physical properties of the system .",
    "this is shown for the damped free motion and the damped harmonic oscillator ( ho ) ( with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ section-7 ] the results are summarized , some conclusions are drawn and perspectives given .",
    "classical hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics describe isolated systems with reversible dynamics . however , realistic physical systems are always in contact with some kind of environment .",
    "this coupling usually introduces the phenomena of irreversibility and dissipation .",
    "how can this be taken into account in the formalism of classical ( hamiltonian or lagrangian ) mechanics and , particularly , in a quantum mechanical context ?",
    "the fundamental classical as well as quantum mechanical equations of motion are invariant under time - reversal and the forces are assumed to be derived from the gradient of a potential , guaranteeing for time - independent potentials conservation of energy . in classical mechanics",
    ", the time - evolution can be traced back to canonical transformations , in quantum mechanics to unitary transformations .",
    "alternative approaches to include irreversibility and dissipation are :    1 .",

    "system - plus - reservoir approaches  @xcite .",
    "modifications of the classical and quantum mechanical equations of motion , leading to non - canonical / non - unitary transformations or nl modifications of the se  @xcite .    in the phenomenological description where a brownian motion - type situation is assumed ,",
    "i.e. , a macroscopic body moving in a viscous liquid ( actually a many - body problem ) , the effect of the bath is described by adding a linear velocity - depending friction force and a stochastic fluctuating force ( that vanishes on average ) to the newtonian equation for the observable macroscopic system . in this effective description of the system",
    "the equation of motion for the average position variable , in one dimension , as assumed throughout this paper without loss of generality , takes the form @xmath8 with @xmath0 the friction coefficient ( _ damping constant _ ) and overdots denoting time - derivatives . as a consequence of the friction force @xmath9 , the velocity and energy of the system decay exponentially .    for a ho ( @xmath10 )",
    ", the friction coefficient @xmath0 is usually referred to as _ ohmic damping _ because eq .",
    "( 1 ) also describes an rlc circuit in series with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the ` charge ' of the capacitor . in classical physics",
    "damping can be introduced without knowledge of the microscopic details of the bath .",
    "although this is often described by a friction force that is linear in velocity , as in the langevin equation ( 1 ) , friction forces that are quadratic in velocity are also relevant for different systems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "a description of the same situation , not in terms of trajectories , but in terms of ( classical ) statistical distribution functions @xmath14 in phase space can be given in terms of a fokker ",
    "planck equation taking into account irreversible diffusion terms .",
    "in particular , in position space this reduces to the smoluchowski equation @xmath15 with the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 that is usually connected with the temperature @xmath17 of the bath via the einstein relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant .    in the system - plus - reservoir approaches ,",
    "the system of interest is coupled to an environment ( consisting usually of a large number of hos ) , where the system and environment together are considered as a closed hamiltonian system . after averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom and some others procedures ( for details",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) an equation of motion for the system of interest including a friction term , e.g. , like the one in the langevin equation , is obtained .",
    "starting point for system - plus - reservoir approaches is usually , on the classical level , the liouville equation for the distribution function @xmath14 in phase space and , quantum mechanically , the equivalent von neumann equation for the density operator in liouville space . in both cases",
    "they are then decomposed ( e.g. by some kind of projection operator ) into a relevant part , describing the system of interest , and an irrelevant part , essentially describing the environment . solving the equation formally for the irrelevant part and inserting this into the equation for the relevant one leads ( after a markovian approximation ) to the so - called generalized master equation  @xcite for the relevant part , describing the system that dissipates energy to the environment .",
    "frequently , an approach by caldeira and leggett  @xcite that is based on this method and modifications thereof are applied .",
    "interestingly for our purpose , this approach can be linked directly to the quantized version of a modification of the classical canonical lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism  @xcite that allows one to include linear velocity - dependent friction forces like the one in eq .",
    "( [ lang - eq ] ) .",
    "more details are given in subsection  [ section-2.1 ] .",
    "a different approach , also based on the generalized master equation of the system - plus - reservoir approach , assumes that a quantum system can always be described by a pure state , no matter if it is in contact with an environment or not  @xcite . in analogy with the generalized master equations mentioned above , gisin derived a corresponding equation of motion for this pure state , represented by a wave function",
    "this leads to a nlse with non - hermitian ( complex ) nonlinearity that still allows for normalizable solutions .",
    "however , the specific form of gisin s nonlinearity and its physical interpretation are not fixed by its derivation .",
    "it turns out that a modified se , based on a smoluchowski equation for the probability density @xmath20 , leads to a formally similar nlse , but here with a fixed form of the ( complex ) nonlinearity and well - defined physical interpretation .",
    "this approach will be discussed in detail in subsection  [ section-2.2 ] , as well as its unique connection with the canonical approaches described in subsection  [ section-2.1 ] .",
    "one type of effective models that is significant for our purpose includes the models that stay within the canonical formalism , thus providing the possibility of obtaining a corresponding se via canonical quantization .",

    "( [ lang - eq ] ) by simply adding a term to the potential @xmath21 are neither in the lagrangian nor in the hamiltonian formalism successful .",
    "however , an approach by caldirola  @xcite and kanai  @xcite , multiplying the lagrangian function by a td exponential factor leads to the desired result .",
