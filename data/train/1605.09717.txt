    "<S> the microscopic nature of dark matter ( dm ) is one of grand challenges of modern physics and cosmology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge lies in extrapolating from the observational galactic to the laboratory or microscopic scales . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently realized  @xcite that ultralight fields , while being cold dm candidates , can also solve the hierarchy problem elevating such fields to the important class of `` economic '' dm models such as weakly - interacting massive particles and axions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to such ultralight fields as vulfs ( virialized ultra - light fields ) . </S>",
    "<S> direct searches for vulfs due to their non - particle nature require low - energy precision measurements . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements , with their exquisite precision , have been historically important in powerfully constraining new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> individual vulf dm search proposals cover a broad range of experiments  @xcite : atomic clocks , magnetometers , accelerometers , interferometers , cavities , resonators , permanent electric - dipole and parity - violation measurements , and extend to gravitational wave detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the sought dm signature in these proposals is dm - induced oscillations of the measured signals at the vulf compton frequencies at the device location . </S>",
    "<S> an important point is that vulfs are _ waves _ , and while they do induce an oscillating in time signal at a given spatial location , dm signals at different locations have a fixed phase relation ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mapsatsearth](a ) ) , i.e. , the signals are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> based on this observation , here we argue that a wider discovery reach can be gained by sampling the dm wave at several locations via a network of precision measurement tools . </S>",
    "<S> further , the vulf signal is composed out of interfering waves traveling at different velocities and in different directions ; thereby the problem of relating signals at different space - time locations requires computations of dark - matter correlation functions , derived here . </S>",
    "<S> based on these ideas and derivations , we propose a number of dm wave detection experiments . in the most basic version , the modifications to already running experiments are minor and only require simple gps - assisted time - stamping of data taking  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> previously a network of precision measurement devices have been proposed for detecting topological defects sweeping through the networks  @xcite ; here we show that such networks can be also used as discovery tools for vulf dark matter .     ( a ) dark - matter wave observatory based on a global network of existing low - energy precision measurement laboratories ( red dots ) around the globe ; ( b ) satellite mission for probing vulf dm correlation function ; both the distance between the satellites and the angle between galactic velocity @xmath0 and separation @xmath1 vectors can be varied . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) terrestrial experiment with fixed nodes utilizes the daily variation of the angle between galactic velocity and two - node separation vector . ]    in the vulf models , dark matter is composed of ultralight spin 0 bosonic fields , oscillating at their compton frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the boson mass ( see review  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies can span many orders of magnitude :  @xmath4 for @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound comes from requiring that the compton wavelength is smaller than the galactic size and the upper limit from requiring that number of particles per de broglie volume is macroscopic ( see supplementary materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposals  @xcite have focused on searching for an oscillating signal at the compton frequency . unfortunately , in a laboratory environment , an observation of an oscillating signal could be ascribed to some mundane ambient noise and it desirable to establish additional dm signatures . </S>",
    "<S> here we derive vulf spatiotemporal correlation functions to probe the dm coherence . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the coherence times and coherence lengths of the signal are related to dm properties . indeed , in the standard halo model ( see , e.g. ,  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , during the galaxy formation , as dm constituents fall into the gravitational potential , their velocity distribution in the galactic reference frame becomes quasi - maxwellian with a characteristic dispersion ( virial ) velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a cut - off at the galactic escape velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity distribution leads to spectral broadening of oscillations ( dephasing ) characterized by the coherence time @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity distribution also results in a spatial dispersion of individual wave packets , leading to the coherence length @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> additional commonality of all the enumerated proposals is the coupling of dm fields to particles and fields in terms of the so - called portals , when the gauge - invariant operators of the sm fields @xmath10 are coupled to the operators involving dm fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of possibilities is the linear coupling ( higgs or linear portal ) , @xmath11 here @xmath10 are various pieces from the sm lagrangian , @xmath12 such as the fermion rest mass energies , electromagnetic field tensor contribution , gluon field contribution , etc . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 are the energy scales , characterizing the strength of the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> quite naturally this portal when combined with the sm lagrangian , leads to variation of fundamental constants , e.g. , the electron rest mass @xmath14 is modulated by dm field as @xmath15 @xmath16 or the fine structure constant @xmath17 @xmath18 , where @xmath14 and @xmath19 are unperturbed quantities . </S>",
    "<S> vulf fields oscillate at compton frequencies , leading to oscillating corrections to fundamental constants  @xcite .    a typical apparatus measures a signal @xmath20 associated with a piece @xmath10 of the sm lagrangian ( or their combination ) . for example , an optical clock measures transition frequencies that depend on @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> then the measured quantity has a dm - induced admixture @xmath21 that is proportional to the field value @xmath22 at the device location . </S>",
    "<S> thereby in the assumption of higgs portal , the correlation between two devices dm signals can be expressed in terms of the two - point dm field correlation function @xmath23 : @xmath24 we could also introduce a correlation function for space - time variation of fundamental constants , e.g. @xmath25 ; it is expressed in terms of dm field correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive the vulf correlation function @xmath26 by generalizing the formalism of quantum optics to massive spin-0 bosons and quasi - maxwellian velocity distribution of dm fields . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation is given in supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting correlation function reads@xmath27 here @xmath28 is the doppler - shifted value of the compton frequency @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the `` galactic '' wave vector associated with the apparatus motion through the dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> the effective field amplitude @xmath31 , and correlation amplitude @xmath32 and phase @xmath33 are defined as @xmath34 where coherence time @xmath35 and length @xmath36 are expressed in terms of the virial velocity @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the correlation function encodes the priors on vulfs  and dm halo , such as the dm energy density in the vicinity of the solar system  @xcite , @xmath38 , motion through the dm halo at @xmath39 and the virial velocity @xmath40 . as such it provides an improved statistical confidence in the event of an observation of dm signal .    </S>",
    "<S> now with the correlation function at hand , we explore the vast vulf parameter landscape . </S>",
    "<S> typical values of various parameters are compiled in table  [ tab : vulf - params ] . </S>",
    "<S> coherence time is roughly a million of compton periods . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence length can be interpreted as the de broglie wavelength of a particle moving at virial velocity and it is thousand times larger than the compton wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the number density of vulf particles @xmath41 ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 for the indicated masses , i.e. , a typical device interacts with a macroscopic number of dm particles . </S>",
    "<S> compton frequencies range from nhz to phz . </S>",
    "<S> notice that one oscillation per year corresponds to @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . as points of reference for the coherence length , </S>",
    "<S> the size of our galaxy is @xmath46 and the earth diameter @xmath47 .    </S>",

    "<S> searching for such resonances has been proposed  @xcite for atomic clocks and the first spectroscopic results were reported  @xcite . for a global network , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial correlations come from the dot product @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is how to probe various distances . in galactic coordinates </S>",
    "<S> , the sun moves through the halo in the @xmath79 direction , roughly towards the cygnus constellation . </S>",
    "<S> the most straightforward approach is to place two satellites with , for example , two precision clocks onboard in the vicinity of a lagrange point , orient their relative position vector @xmath1 towards cygnus constellation ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mapsatsearth](b ) ) and carry out a series of measurements at various distances . </S>",
    "<S> this would map out the spatial part of the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> more practical approach is to carry out terrestrial experiments ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapsatsearth](c ) ) with fixed positions of network nodes and rely on the angular dependence of the @xmath80 of the phase . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath81 would change due to the earth rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the inclination angle of the cygnus constellation ( i.e. direction of motion through the halo ) as seen from the earth is about @xmath82 . as an example , consider two geographically remote labs located along the 45th parallel ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapsatsearth](c ) ) . their two - node correlation function would sample @xmath83 in the range from zero to @xmath84 over the course of one day . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the coherence length @xmath85 , thereby two sites have the most sensitivity for @xmath86 .    the geographic arrangement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapsatsearth](c ) serves as an illustrative example as simply time - synchronized measurements in existing laboratories  @xcite , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapsatsearth](a ) , should be sufficient for the proposed global data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> gnome network  @xcite infrastructure can serve as a natural host for the vulf dm observatory . </S>",
    "<S> one could also use clocks on numerous navigational satellites , such as gps , to search for correlation patterns  @xcite ; these have an advantage of half - a - day orbits ( gps ) and a large @xmath8750,000 km aperture . </S>",
    "<S> elisa gravitational wave mission  @xcite ( a network of three satellites ) can also be used for vulf detection . </S>",
    "<S> another point is that the network does not need to be homogenous , and various precision measurement tools can be included in the network . indeed , as long as the dm portal is linear , eq.([eq : linearportal ] ) , such a global observatory can `` cast a much wider net '' on possible dm couplings . </S>",
    "<S> compared to an individual device , the statistical sensitivity of a correlated network is improved by the factor @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> it is further improved through the sampling of the @xmath83 phase by @xmath90 ( @xmath91 measurements of correlation function ) . </S>",
    "<S> all individual detector proposals  @xcite searching for compton frequency oscillations can substantially constrain yet unexplored parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need to reproduce projected sensitivities of these proposals here ; one could simple rescale them by the factor @xmath92 .    for co - located devices ( or the same apparatus ) , the `` local '' temporal correlation function is@xmath93 notice the presence of the coherence length in the combination @xmath94 ; it arise due to our motion through dm halo over the lag time @xmath95 thereby sampling dm fields @xmath96 distance apart . for @xmath97 </S>",
    "<S> this translates into the @xmath98 distance . considering that @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the signal primary oscillation frequency also depends on @xmath100 since the earth velocity changes seasonally , annual velocity modulations are imprinted in the correlation function .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> , one would obtain a time series of measurements @xmath101 at @xmath102 , compute auto - correlation function @xmath103 and see if it fits eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : localcorrelation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> another approach is to work in the frequency space and examine the power spectral density of @xmath104 given by the fourier transform of @xmath105 . to facilitate a comparison with @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we can define the _ dm - induced line - shape _ as a fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is normalized as @xmath108 . with @xmath109 and @xmath110 </S>",
    "<S> the resulting `` dm line - shape '' reads @xmath111 this holds for detunings @xmath112 , otherwise @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the profile is shown in fig.[fig : dmprofile ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected the line - width is @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the profile is strongly asymmetric due to parabolic dispersion relation for massive non - relativistic bosons . for @xmath115 , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum @xmath116 value of @xmath117 is attained at @xmath118 and the width at half - maximum is @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> it is broad in the spectroscopic sense as @xmath120 .    . </S>",
    "<S> dashed vertical line marks the position of the doppler - shifted compton frequency @xmath121 and the line - width at half maximum in the frequency space is @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dmprofile ] ]    now we examine a practical example of a network : a network of atomic clocks . as an illustration we focus on two nodes each hosting identical devices in the configuration of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapsatsearth](b ) , i.e. , orientation with respect to galactic velocity @xmath0 is static yet we can vary the distance @xmath123 between the nodes . extension to rotating reference frame for terrestrial networks is straightforward . in our preceding discussion </S>",
    "<S> we assumed that the measurements were instantaneous ; in practice there is always a finite interrogation time @xmath124 for a single measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the next measurement is taken right after the previous one was completed ( no `` dead '' times ) and that the measurements at different nodes are synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> we form a time series of fractional frequency excursions @xmath125 taken at @xmath126 for a fixed distance @xmath123 , with @xmath127 labeling the node and @xmath128 being the nominal clock frequency ( strictly speaking one needs to form frequency ratios of two co - located clocks  @xcite ) . the vulf contribution to @xmath129 </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed in terms of sensitivity coefficients @xmath130 and single - measurement accumulated clock phase @xmath131 notice the integral of the vulf field time evolution history over the interrogation duration . </S>",
    "<S> the two - node correlator @xmath132 reduces to a double integral over the field correlation function @xmath133 : @xmath134 , with @xmath135 . while @xmath136 can be numerically evaluated with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fieldcorrfuncanalyl ] ) , we demonstrate the essential features in the limit of infinite coherence lengths and times ( @xmath137 , i.e. with @xmath138 , eq .  ( [ eq : gcoherent ] ) : @xmath139 the dependence on the distance @xmath123 is transparent . </S>",
    "<S> the `` window '' function @xmath140 emphasizes the dependence on the ratio of interrogation time to the period of vulf oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> if vulf oscillations are slow compared to @xmath124 , then @xmath141 and if they are fast , the effect tends to average out , @xmath142 . for a typical  @xcite @xmath143 </S>",
    "<S> , the separation between the two regimes occurs for @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) . </S>",
    "<S> another consideration is synchronization accuracy : for fast oscillations , the uncertainly comes from @xmath146 in @xmath147 : if @xmath124 is uncertain @xmath148 , the @xmath147-factor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : g - network ] ) has uncontrolled oscillatory behavior invalidating the entire analysis . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has demonstrated open - air synchronization of optical clocks at the level of fs . </S>",
    "<S> thereby we expect that a network should remain sensitive to @xmath149 ; at such frequencies the smallness of coherence time on the interrogation time - scale becomes more important . </S>",
    "<S> similar considerations apply to fiber networks  @xcite and gps time transfer  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have discussed large - scale experiments : a satellite mission where the distance @xmath123 between the devices can be in the order of @xmath150 km and terrestrial networks where the separations can be as large as @xmath151 km . finally , it is worth pointing out that small - scale experiments can probe a complementary parameter space of large masses ( see table  [ tab : vulf - params ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the coherence length of sub - mev vulfs is of a meter scale , while ev vulfs have @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> these lengths suggest table - top experiments or measurements with optical tweezers  @xcite where the distance between individual atoms can be varied . </S>",
    "<S> additional advantage of table - top experiments is a better synchronization as the common laser source can be used to probe both locations and the possibility of using rotating tables  @xcite that would compensate for the earth rotation with respect to the galactic wave vector .    _ </S>",
