    "in the recent years there has been a renewed attention on ev sterile neutrinos , suggested by anomalies found in the short - baseline neutrino experiments ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in this context",
    ", it has been realized that these light sterile states would be efficiently produced in the early universe by oscillations with active neutrinos , leading to a conflict with different cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "this problem motivated the investigation of different mechanisms to suppress the sterile neutrino thermalization ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in  @xcite it has been recently proposed a novel suppression mechanism based on the introduction of secret interactions among sterile neutrinos , mediated by a massive gauge boson @xmath1 , with @xmath5 ( see  @xcite for the case of sterile neutrinos interacting with a ligh pseudoscalar ) .",
    "indeed , these secret interactions would generate a large matter term in the sterile neutrino sector , which lowers the effective neutrino in - medium mixing angle .",
    "however , as the matter potential declines , a resonance is eventually encountered .",
    "sterile neutrinos would be produced by a combination of ( damped ) mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw)-like resonant flavor conversions among active and sterile neutrinos  @xcite , and the non - resonant processes associated with the secret collisional effects  @xcite .",
    "it particular , assuming for secret interactions a coupling costant @xmath0 and masses of the mediator @xmath6  mev , the sterile neutrino production would occur at @xmath7  mev , with non trivial consequences on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite . in this context , in  @xcite it has been shown that bbn observations would lead to severe constraints on the parameter space of the model , reducing the range which satisfies cosmological bounds .    in  @xcite much lighter bosons",
    "were considered .",
    "the advantage of this choice seems twofold . on one hand the matter potential",
    "would be so strong to inhibit any sterile neutrino production during bbn , thus evading the corresponding constraints .",
    "moreover , if the new interaction mediator @xmath1 couples not only to sterile neutrinos but also to dark matter particles , for such small masses it might also possibly relieve some of the small - scale structure problems of the cold dark matter scenario  @xcite ( nonstandard interactions were also introduced to alleviate these problems in  @xcite and in the references therein ) . secret interactions among sterile neutrinos , mediated by very light ( or even massless ) pseudoscalars , and their connection with dark matter was explored in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that also for these small masses a large sterile neutrino production is unavoidable at @xmath8  mev , when the matter potential becomes smaller than the vacuum oscillation term .",
    "indeed , the small vacuum oscillations act as _ seed _ for a _ scattering - induced decoherent production _ of sterile neutrinos , associated with the secret self - interactions in the sterile sector .",
    "this process is very rapid and leads to a quick flavor equilibration among the active and the sterile neutrino species after the active neutrino decoupling .",
    "we will explore the consequences of this large sterile neutrino abundance on cosmological observables , namely the effective number of neutrinos @xmath3 at matter radiation equality and recombination and the sterile neutrino mass bounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii we present an overview of the flavor evolution for the active - sterile neutrino system in the presence of secret interactions . in section iii",
    "we discuss the scattering - induced decoherent production of sterile neutrinos , associated with the secret interactions in the post - decoupling epoch . in section",
    "iv we discuss the observable signatures of this scenario for very fast sterile - sterile scattering processes .",
    "we find that active - sterile neutrino flavor conversions leads to a reduction of @xmath3 down to 2.7 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4  mev sterile neutrinos would be free - streaming before they become a non relativistic species .",
    "thus , their large number density would affect the large - scale structure power spectrum . in this case",
    ", we compare the sterile neutrino abundance with the most recent cosmological mass bounds finding a tension for an ev mass range sterile state . finally , in section v we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "we consider a 3 + 1 neutrino mixing scenario , involving the three active families and a sterile species . as usual",

    "in particular , the two contributions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energy density of @xmath29 pairs , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . finally , the term proportional to @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) represents the new matter secret potential where @xmath33 is the energy density of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "flavor evolution generally occurs at @xmath36 ( we comment below for the case @xmath37 ) , so that one can reduce it to a contact interaction , with an effective strength   @xmath38 the numerical factor @xmath39 has been included in order to have in the @xmath1 sector the same relation which holds among the fermi constant @xmath26 , the @xmath40 coupling constant @xmath41 and the @xmath42-mass in the standard model .",
    "when this matter term is of the order of the vacuum oscillation frequency , associated with @xmath21 , a msw resonance among active and sterile neutrinos occurs  @xcite . in the following",

    "since we will work at @xmath44  mev , the standard collisional term @xmath45 in the active sector  @xcite can be neglected and we only consider the collisional effect in the sterile sector , associated with the secret self - interactions @xmath46 , which reads  @xcite @xmath47 = { -i}\\frac{\\gamma_x}{2}[{\\sf s}_x , [ \\rho , { \\sf s}_x ] ] \\,\\ , \\label{eq : collis}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the scattering rate  @xcite ,   instead of @xmath49 . ] with @xmath50 the average - momentum for a thermal fermi - dirac distribution , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 the sterile and the active neutrino abundance , respectively . in flavor basis",
    ", @xmath53 is the matrix with the numerical coefficients for the scattering process .",
    "notice that , in the range we consider for @xmath32 the elastic scattering terms which redistribute momenta are much larger than hubble parameter , so we expect any initial sterile distribution will rapidly approach the standard fermi - dirac shape .",
    "the interplay between flavor oscillations and collisions becomes more transparent considering the equations of motion [ eq .",
    "( [ drhodt])([eq : omega ] ) ] in the case of mixing of only one active flavor with the sterile neutrinos . in this case one may write @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the pauli matrices .",
    "one recovers the known evolution of the polarization vector @xmath58 , expressed by the stodolsky s formula  @xcite @xmath59 the first term at the right - hand - side represents the precession of the polarization vector * p * around @xmath60 .",
    "the effect of the collisions is to destroy the coherence of the flavor evolution , leading to a shrinking of the length of * p*. more precisely , the component of the polarization vector `` transverse '' to the flavor basis @xmath61 is damped with a rate @xmath62 ( we remind the reader that @xmath61 represents the off - diagonal elements of @xmath12 ) .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the combination of precession and damping can lead to different behaviors depending on the relative strength of the two effects .",
    "in particular , when the typical oscillation rate ( @xmath63 ) , collision rate ( @xmath64 ) and the expansion rate of the universe ( @xmath65 ) , obey the hierarchy @xmath66 the flavor dynamics can be described as follows .",
    "active neutrinos @xmath67 start to oscillate into sterile states @xmath34 . the average probability to find a sterile neutrinos in a scattering time scale ( @xmath68 )",
    "is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in each collision , the momentum of the @xmath34 component is changed , while the @xmath67 component remains unaffected .",
    "therefore , after a collision the two flavors are no longer in the same momentum state , and then they can no longer oscillate .",
    "conversely , they start to evolve independently . however , the remaining active neutrinos can develop a new coherent @xmath34 component which is made incoherent in the next collision , and so on .",
    "the process continues till one reaches a flavor equilibrium with equal number of @xmath67 and @xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath70 , i.e. a completely mixed ensemble ) . starting with a pure active flavor state , corresponding to @xmath71 , the final density matrix would be @xmath72 . the averaged relaxation rate to reach this chemical equilibrium is  @xcite @xmath73 notice that this rate is non zero as soon as an initial sterile neutrino density is produced when the matter term becomes of the order of the vacuum oscillation frequency .",
    "this initial sterile abundance is again proportional to the conversion probability .",
    "thus @xmath74 is , at first , proportional to the square of @xmath69 .    in the following",
    "we will show that the conditions to trigger this dynamics are always fulfilled at @xmath44  mev , leading to a copious sterile neutrino production .",
    "the key observation is that , although the refractive potential is smaller than the oscillation rate and the collisional cross sections are even smaller , yet they exceed the hubble rate and lead to scattering - induced decoherent production of sterile neutrinos .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the behavior of the different neutrino refractive and collisional rates normalized to the hubble rate @xmath75 , versus photon temperature @xmath76 ( see  @xcite for details ) . for the sake of illustration",
    ", we show the quantity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega])-([eq : dampgamma ] ) averaged over thermal fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "results are shown for @xmath77 .",
    "left panel is for @xmath78  @xmath26 , or @xmath79  mev , while right panel corresponds to @xmath80  @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath81  mev .",
    "we show the active - sterile vacuum term ( solid curve ) and the secret matter potential ( dotted curve ) assuming @xmath82 , corresponding to the initial sterile neutrino abundance induced by vacuum oscillations ( see later ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath83 the real form of the matter potential would deviate from the contact structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : contact ] ) used in the figure ( see  @xcite ) . in particular , for @xmath84 the potential would vanish , leading to a possible production of @xmath34 when this condition is fulfilled .",
    "however , since the duration of this phase is expected to be shorter than the inverse of the sterile neutrino production rate @xmath85 , for simplicity we neglect this possible ( small ) extra - contribution of sterile neutrinos . in the left panel",
    "a resonance would take place at @xmath86  mev , while in the right panel at @xmath87  mev .",
    "this resonance excites sterile states .",
    "in principle one should perform numerical simulations in a ( 3 + 1 ) scheme in order to calculate the resonant sterile neutrino abundance and the further flavor evolution .",
    "however , in the presence of the very large matter potential and collisional term , induced by the secret interactions , these would be computationally demanding .",
    "moreover , our main argument is not related to the details of the corresponding dynamics .",
    "therefore , for simplicity we assume that the resonance is completely non - adiabatic , so we have to take into account only the vacuum production of sterile neutrinos at lower temperatures when the matter term becomes smaller than the vacuum oscillation term , associated with @xmath21 .",
    "this is a very conservative assumption .",
    "however , it allows us to easily compute the flavor evolution and is enough to show the role of the damping term .",
    "the active - sterile vacuum oscillation probability , averaged over a collision time scale , is given by  @xcite @xmath88 taking as representative mixing angle @xmath89  @xcite , one would expect a sterile neutrino abundance , @xmath90 .",
    "this seems a negligible contribution , but is enough to generate a large scattering rate proportional to @xmath49 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] as dashed curves .",
    "as one can see , at @xmath91  mev , @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the scattering - induced decoherent production will lead to a quick flavor equilibrium . starting with a density matrix having @xmath93",
    "one thus , quickly reaches @xmath94 for all the parameter space associated with ev sterile neutrino anomalies .",
    "notice that this result does not depend on the particular value of @xmath32 , but only on the fact that the condition of strong damping is realized . the same equilibrium value would remain valid for example , for smaller masses @xmath95 by different order of magnitudes , at least until we can treat the collisional term as a four  point effective interactions , i.e. for @xmath37 . as discussed before ,",
    "the rate of sterile neutrino re - thermalization is extremely fast , so that the process is instantaneous . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dampgamma ] ) and ( [ eq : rel ] ) one can estimate @xmath96  mev for the cases we have shown .",
    "this means that it is practically impossible to numerically follow the rise of the sterile neutrino production . however , it can be interesting to appreciate this dynamics in a case where the process is slower .",
    "we address the interested reader to the lower panel of fig .  3 in  @xcite , where it is shown the evolution of the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath12 in a ( 2 + 1 ) scheme , for a scenario with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "in this case the sterile neutrino production starts at @xmath99  mev and the final value would be @xmath100 , as expected with only three oscillating neutrino families .",
    "furthermore , we mention that the final equilibrium value does not depend on the exact values of the active - sterile neutrino mixing angles . indeed",
    ", we explicitly checked that also assuming that the sterile species mixes only with an active one , all the flavors will participate to the equilibrium , due to the presence of the active mixing angles that connect the different species , and indirectly link them also to the sterile species .",
    "secret interactions mediated by a light ( or even massless ) pseudo - scalar ( @xmath101 ) , with a lagrangian @xmath102 , were considered in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that couplings @xmath103 were sufficient to block thermalization prior to neutrino decoupling ( and make dark matter sufficiently self - interacting ) .",
    "however , as long as @xmath104 the @xmath105 plasma would be strongly interacting till sterile neutrinos become non - relativistic .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of @xmath34 production and flavor equilibration would apply also to this case .",
    "however , in the massless case , there would be also the production of a bath of @xmath1 via the @xmath106 process ( with a rate @xmath107 ) .",
    "therefore one would expect a chemical equilibrium over the five species , with an abundance @xmath108 for each of them .",
    "as mentioned in  @xcite , a plasma of strongly - interacting @xmath34 and @xmath1 can have interesting cosmological signatures , since the @xmath105 bath would behave as a single massless component with no anisotropic stress .",
    "the initial snapshot of active and sterile neutrino distribution soon after steriles are excited via oscillation is a shared grey body distribution , a fermi - dirac function weighted by a factor 3/4 for each species . in absence of any interaction ,",
    "these distribution would remain frozen but for the effect of momentum redshift . in the model we are considering , after their production sterile neutrinos are fastly rescattering among themselves via secret interactions of order @xmath49 .",
    "they are therefore , collisional .",
    "in fact , a grey body distribution is not a solution of the collisional boltzmann equation , so these scattering processes will push the sterile distribution towards a fermi - dirac shape , with the constraint that the total neutrino number density is kept constant . furthermore , as soon as sterile neutrinos change their distribution this has a feedback on active neutrino distribution too , which are still efficiently oscillating into sterile states .",
    "this implies that all neutrino species in presence of sterile - sterile scattering will adjust quite efficiently their distribution to a thermal equilibrium distribution . the constant number density ( or entropy )",
    "constraint implies that their eventual temperature is reduced by a factor @xmath109 with respect to the initial active neutrino temperature @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath111 + 1 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are in fact , no pair production processes from the electromagnetic plasma which can refill active neutrino densities , since in the scenario we are considering , sterile neutrinos are excited well below the active neutrino decoupling phase .    from these considerations we see that the total energy density stored in active and sterile neutrinos is reduced .",
    "indeed , before sterile neutrinos are excited , and after @xmath112 annihilation phase , active neutrinos energy density is given by @xmath113 where the photon energy density is @xmath114 and the effective number of neutrino species is @xmath115 , neglecting the small effect due to partial neutrino heating of order @xmath116 @xcite . after sterile states are produced via oscillations and kinetic equilibrium",
    "is reached via secret interactions , we have four species which share a common temperature @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , till all neutrinos are fully relativistic @xmath118 and correspondingly the value of @xmath3 decreases to @xmath119    this value is only slightly reduced at the matter radiation equality , i.e. for @xmath120 ev , since at this energy scale only the high energy tail of sterile neutrino distribution counts as radiation .",
    "if we weight this contribution with the ratio of corresponding pressure over the pressure of a purely relativistic gas , as in @xcite and assume relativistic active states at this epoch , we find with @xmath121  ev @xmath122 where the first and second terms in bracket are the active and sterile contribution , respectively and @xmath123 + 1 }   \\ , , \\\\ & & p_0 = 2 \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\frac{p}{3 } \\frac{1}{\\exp[p/(t_\\nu(3/4)^{1/3})]+1}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a value of the effective number of neutrino smaller than the expected standard result would be a signature in favour of strongly interacting sterile states mixed with active neutrinos , though there might be different models which can account for this result ( e.g. , low - reheating scenarios  @xcite ) .",
    "presently , the most precise determination of @xmath3 is from planck experiment . in the standard @xmath124cdm model but allowing for a free number of relativistic species",
    "the result is @xmath125 ( 68 % c.l . )",
    "@xcite , which is compatible with ( [ finalneff ] ) at about 2@xmath57 . a new data release by planck collaboration is expected soon , including polarization data .",
    "this might put further constraint on @xmath3 . in the future even more tight bounds",
    "are foreseen to come by next generation experiment such as euclid  @xcite , which should reach a sensitivity of order @xmath126 .      the sterile neutrino production due to the scattering - induced decoherent effects is expected to affect the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structures ( lss ) , which are both sensitive to neutrino mass scale in the @xmath127 ev 1 ev range . one of the main effect of a massive neutrino is due their free streaming till the epoch when they become non relativistic , which suppresses the growth of perturbations on small scales",
    "however , if sterile states scatters via secret interactions , the free streaming regime is delayed until the scattering rate becomes smaller than the hubble parameter .",
    "this means that if @xmath32 is large enough so that this condition holds at the non relativistic transition , sterile neutrinos would never have a free streaming phase , but always diffuse .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath32 for which this happens can be obtained from the condition that scattering rate equals the value of @xmath65 at a temperature @xmath128 @xmath129 using standard expression of the hubble rate in the @xmath130 ev range and the fact that , as we have seen , sterile temperature is given by @xmath131 this gives @xmath132 , which corresponds to @xmath133  mev for @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the mass bound discussed below only applies _ as long as the coupling @xmath32 is smaller than this value_.    assuming that the active neutrinos are much lighter than the sterile species , one can define an effective sterile neutrino mass  @xcite @xmath135 latest analysis in  @xcite of the sterile neutrino anomalies gives a best - fit @xmath136  ev@xmath23 with a @xmath137 range @xmath138 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : effmass ] ) the lower value in the 2@xmath57 range gives @xmath139  ev .",
    "this value has to be compared with the cosmological mass bounds .",
    "we also comment that the global analysis of sterile neutrino anomalies presented in  @xcite finds a discrepancy between appearance and disappearance sterile neutrino data .",
    "as a consequence only a small region around @xmath140  ev@xmath23 would be compatible with all data . this would correspond to @xmath141  ev .",
    "cosmological bounds on sterile neutrino mass and abundance in the early universe are rather sensitive to the data set used in the analysis , notably cmb data from planck  @xcite and the recent but controversial bicep2 experiment  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , lss , @xmath142 measurements as well as lensing and cluster data ( cfhtlens+psz ) .",
    "in particular , the planck collaboration combines planck with wmap polarization data , baryon acoustic oscillation and high multipole cmb data . in this case",
    "the bound obtained is @xmath143  ev at 95@xmath144 c.l .",
    "@xcite , which is in strong disagreement with the sterile neutrino abundance produced by the secret interactions .",
    "moreover a possible non - zero sterile neutrino mass has been claimed in order to relieve the discrepancy between the cmb measurements and other observations , like current expansion rate @xmath142 , the galaxy shear power spectrum and counts of galaxy clusters , providing a value @xmath141  ev at @xmath145  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) or an upper bound of @xmath146  ev  @xcite .",
    "stronger bounds have also be quoted in  @xcite .    in general , from the results presented here , one would conclude that the minimum @xmath139  ev obtained from the secret collisional production and compatible with the @xmath21 range would be in tension ( at least at 2@xmath57 level ) with the bounds on sterile neutrino mass from cosmology .",
    "a possible way out to this result is to consider extremely high couplings , @xmath147 , since in this case sterile - sterile scatterings are in equilibrium till the ev scale , when they become non relativistic .",
    "as we mentioned , they would never experience a free streaming regime and cosmological mass bounds do not apply .    to close",
    ", we remark that in deriving our constraint we have been conservative , since we have assumed that sterile neutrinos are produced only by vacuum oscillations at @xmath148  mev .",
    "however , it has been argued in  @xcite that there could be another colder primordial population of @xmath34 generated at @xmath149  gev by the decoupling of the @xmath150 sector from standard particles .",
    "this additional contribution would increase the tension between the sterile neutrino abundance and the cosmological mass bound .",
    "secret interactions among sterile neutrinos mediated by a light gauge boson @xmath1 have been recently proposed as an intriguing possibility to suppress the thermalization of ev sterile neutrinos in the early universe . in particular , interactions mediated by a gauge boson with @xmath151  mev would suppress the sterile neutrino productions for @xmath152  ev and seemed therefore safe from cosmological constraints related to big - bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite .    in the present work we have shown that when the matter potential produced by the sterile interactions becomes smaller than the vacuum oscillation frequency , sterile neutrinos are copiously produced by the scattering - induced decoherent effects in the sterile neutrino sector .",
    "this process would lead to a quick flavor equilibration , with a sterile neutrino abundance largely independent on the specific values of @xmath32 and @xmath95 .",
    "a possible complete re - thermalization of sterile neutrinos and its impact on mass bound was already advocated in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have shown that due to the large damping effects this is _ always _ the case in secret interactions among sterile neutrinos with low @xmath95 masses .",
    "we investigated the cosmological consequences of this huge sterile neutrino population .",
    "we find that a signature of secret interactions would be a reduction of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath3 down to 2.7 .",
    "if this value is compatible with the 2@xmath57 range given by the planck experiment  @xcite , the future experiment euclid  @xcite , with a sensitivity to @xmath126 may probe this small deviation with respect to the standard expectation .",
    "moreover , for @xmath4  mev , sterile neutrinos would be free - streaming at the matter - radiation equality epoch .",
    "then , the large sterile neutrino production would be in tension with the most recent cosmological mass bounds on sterile neutrinos .",
    "we note that for the parameters @xmath153  mev , where secret interactions would play also an interesting role in relation to dark matter and small - scale structures  @xcite , sterile neutrinos would be at the border between free - streaming and collisional regime at the neutrino decoupling . in this case",
    "a dedicated investigations is necessary to assess if mass bounds apply also in this case or can be evaded .    finally , we mention that recently it also been speculated that the background of sterile neutrinos produced by the collisions associated with the secret interactions , would also modify the optical depth of ultra - high - energy recently observed by icecube  @xcite",
    ". therefore , future high - energy neutrino observations would be an interesting additional channel to probe this scenario .",

    "<S> secret interactions among sterile neutrinos have been recently proposed as an escape - route to reconcile ev sterile neutrino hints from short - baseline anomalies with cosmological observations . in particular models with coupling @xmath0 and gauge </S>",
    "<S> boson mediators @xmath1 with @xmath2  mev lead to large matter potential suppressing the sterile neutrino production before the neutrino decoupling . with this choice of parameter ranges , </S>",
    "<S> big bang nucleosynthesis is left unchanged and gives no bound on the model . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that at lower temperatures when active - sterile oscillations are no longer matter suppressed , sterile neutrinos are still in a collisional regime , due to their secret self - interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between vacuum oscillations and collisions leads to a scattering - induced decoherent production of sterile neutrinos with a fast rate . </S>",
    "<S> this process is responsible for a flavor equilibration among the different neutrino species . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effect of this large sterile neutrino population on cosmological observables . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a signature of strong secret interactions would be a reduction of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath3 at matter radiation equality down to 2.7 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for @xmath4  mev sterile neutrinos would be free - streaming before becoming non - relativistic and they would affect the large - scale structure power spectrum . as a consequence , for this range of parameters we find a tension of a ev mass sterile state with cosmological neutrino mass bounds . </S>"
