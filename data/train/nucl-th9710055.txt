    "models that are based on the interacting boson approximation @xcite provide a consistent description of nuclear structure phenomena in spherical , deformed and transitional nuclei .",
    "many extensions of the original interacting boson model ( ibm-1 ) @xcite have been studied . in particular ,",
    "models have been constructed to describe the physics of high - spin states in nuclei ( @xmath3 ) . in the formulation of these models",
    "one has to go beyond the boson approximation and include selected non - collective fermion degrees of freedom . by including part of the original shell - model fermion space through successive breaking of correlated s and d pairs , the ibm is extended to describe the structure of high - spin states .",
    "this extension of the model is especially relevant for transitional regions , where single - particle excitations and vibrational collectivity are dominant modes , and the traditional cranking approach to high - spin physics is not adequate .",
    "the model that we present is an extension of our previous work on the the physics of high - spin states in even - even and odd - even nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the ibm-1 @xcite ; the boson space consists of _ s _ and _ d _ bosons , with no distinction between protons and neutrons . to generate high - spin states",
    ", the model allows one or two bosons to be destroyed and to form non - collective fermion pairs , represented by two- and four - quasiparticle states which recouple to the boson core .",
    "high - spin states are described in terms of broken pairs .",
    "the model space for an even - even nucleus with @xmath4 valence nucleons is @xmath5 the model hamiltonian has four terms : the ibm-1 boson hamiltonian , the fermion hamiltonian , the boson - fermion interaction , and a pair breaking interaction that mixes states with different number of fermions . in previous versions of the model for even - even nuclei",
    ", we could only separately consider neutron or proton excitations .",
    "mixed configurations were not included in the model space , i.e. fermions in broken pairs had to be identical nucleons . for odd - a nuclei , we have extended the ibfm  @xcite to describe one- and three - fermion structures  @xcite . in that model",
    "mixed proton - neutron configurations have been included in the model bases .",
    "the two fermions in a broken pair can be of the same type as the unpaired fermion , resulting in a space with three identical fermions .",
    "if the fermions in the broken pair are different from the unpaired fermion , the fermion basis contains two protons and one neutron or vice versa .",
    "we have applied the model to the description of high - spin states in even - even and odd - even nuclei in the hg  @xcite , sr - zr  @xcite and nd - sm  @xcite regions . in several even - even nuclei high - spin bands",
    "have been observed , that could not be described by model calculations .",
    "they were interpreted as possible two proton - two neutron excitations , not included in our fermion model space . in the present work",
    "we extend the model to include , in addition to two broken pairs of identical nucleons , the configurations with two different broken pairs , one of protons and one of neutrons .",
    "we continue our investigation of high - spin bands in the nd - sm region , and apply the model to the structure of positive and negative parity bands in @xmath0nd .",
    "this nucleus is especially interesting since , in addition to quadrupole bands , a number of high - spin dipole bands have been observed .",
    "the occurrence of regular @xmath6 sequences in nearly spherical or transitional nuclei is a relatively new phenomenon .",
    "it has attracted much interest , but this is the first time that dipole bands in even - even nuclei are described in the framework of a model that is based on the interacting boson approximation .",
    "this means that we do not have to assume a geometrical picture for these bands , and that they result from a consistent calculation of the complete excitation spectrum , which includes also the ground state band and two- and four - quasiparticle quadrupole bands . in section",
    "ii we present an outline of the model .",
    "the calculated excitation spectrum of @xmath0nd is compared with recent experimental data in section iii .",
    "an even - even nucleus with @xmath4 valence nucleons is described as a system of @xmath7 interacting bosons .",
    "the bosons represent collective fermion pair states ( correlated s and d pairs ) that approximate the valence nucleon pairs . in order to generate high angular momentum states ,",
    "one or two bosons can be destroyed .",
    "they form noncollective pairs , represented by two- and four - quasiparticle states that couple to the boson core .",
    "fermions in broken pairs should in principle occupy all the valence single - particle orbitals from which the bosons have been mapped .",
    "however , for the description of high - spin bands close to the yrast line , the most important are the unique parity high - j orbitals for which the coriolis anti - pairing effect is much more pronounced .",
    "we define the model hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the boson hamiltonian of ibm-1  @xcite , and @xmath10 is the fermion hamiltonian which contains single - fermion energies and fermion - fermion interactions .",

    "nuclei in the a = 130 - 140 mass region are @xmath29-soft and the polarizing effect of the aligned nucleons induces changes in the nuclear shape . in all even - even nuclei the alignment of both proton and neutron pairs in the @xmath30 orbital generates low - lying 10@xmath31 states , in many cases isomeric . by coupling the proton and neutron pairs to collective core excitations , @xmath32 decoupled bands are generated with the 10@xmath31 as band - head states . because of the different nature of the excitations ( particles for proton , and holes for neutron configurations ) , the alignment of a pair of @xmath30 protons drives the nucleus towards a collective shape opposite to that induced by the alignment of the neutron pair .",
    "one therefore expects to observe different coexisting structures at similar excitation energies . employing the ibm with broken pairs ,",
    "we have described many low - spin and high - spin properties of @xmath29-soft nuclei of this region ( in the ibm language o(6 ) nuclei ) : @xmath11nd  @xcite , @xmath33nd  @xcite and @xmath34sm  @xcite .    in the present work we use the ibm with proton and neutron broken pairs to describe the excitation spectrum of @xmath0nd .",

    "are predominantly coupled to @xmath71 , and for @xmath72 there is also a large contribution from components with @xmath73 .",
    "band 8 corresponds to two aligned @xmath30 neutrons with @xmath73 , coupled to the boson core .",
    "we notice that the model calculation reproduces in detail the quadrupole collective two - proton and two - neutron bands . finally ,",

    "the states @xmath74$]@xmath75 $ ] are coupled to the ground state band of the core .",

    "@xmath76 high - spin bands have been described as tac ( tilted axis cranking ) solutions  @xcite . in our model such @xmath76 structures result from the fermion - boson interaction of unpaired fermions with the core , as well as from the residual proton - neutron interaction between unpaired fermions in unique - parity high - j orbitals . in order to obtain the correct energy spacings for bands 10 and 11 , it was necessary to include the additional term  ( [ chi_prime ] ) in the boson quadrupole operator .",
    "we have also found that the proton - neutron @xmath26-interaction plays a crucial role in the excitation spectrum of these bands .",

    "this is a structure one normally expects to find in transitional @xmath29-soft nuclei .",
    "the quasi - degeneracy of the doublets is removed in step two , where the term ( [ chi_prime ] ) has been included in the dynamical interactions for protons and neutrons .",
    "finally , the correct excitation energies relative to the band - head 16@xmath31 are obtained in step three with the inclusion of the proton - neutron residual interaction .",
    "it should be noted that bands 10 and 11 have been recently described in the framework of the projected shell model  @xcite .",
    "this model uses a fixed deformation and provides a good description for the near yrast spectra of well deformed nuclei with stable shape . in order to obtain bands of dipole character ,",
    "an axially symmetric shape with deformation @xmath77 had to be assumed , which in turn made energetically more favorable one of the neutrons to occupy the @xmath78 orbital .",
    "therefrom the configuration @xmath1 @xmath78 @xmath79 was assigned to bands 10 and 11 .",
    "the dipole character of the bands results from the coupling of the neutron hole in @xmath30 and the neutron particle in @xmath80 .",
    "this interpretation does not agree with the results of our calculation .",
    "when included in our model space , the structures based on the @xmath78 orbital are found high above the yrast . since @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the lowest two - fermion bands , it is hard to see how could it be that four - fermion bands based on these configurations",
    "are not observed in the experiment .",
    "a larger deformation induced by polarization effects could place these configurations higher above the yrast .",
    "such deformation however , should then result from the dynamics , and not as an additional parameter .",
    "we notice that a very similar dipole band , at approximately the same excitation energy , was found also in @xmath33nd  @xcite .",
    "this nucleus is closer to the @xmath83 shell , and therefore deformations induced by polarization effects should be even smaller . on the other hand , using a unique set of parameters , we have been able to reproduce the complete experimental spectrum of positive parity states , from the ground state band to band 11 , up to angular momentum 29 @xmath84 at more than 13 mev excitation energy .",

    "the fermion part of the model space includes one and two neutron pairs .",

    "the quasiparticle energies and occupation probabilities : @xmath87 mev , @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 .",
    "the neutron parameters are the same as in the calculation of positive parity states , except that @xmath91 and @xmath92 mev .",
    "these are effective interactions , and therefore the strength parameters depend on the fermion model space . however , the precise values are not that important for the structure of bands . in this particular case , the absence of the exchange interaction affects the moments of inertia of the bands , and the strength of the @xmath26-interaction is determined from the energy splittings between even and odd spin states .",
    "the lowest calculated states are compared with the experimental bands 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "the theoretical bands are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the bands are based on the @xmath93 configuration , coupled to the collective ground state band . in the lower part of the spectrum",
    "there are also significant contributions from components based on the configuration @xmath94 , but generally states based on this configuration are higher in energy .",
    "we have also investigated the possibility that the lowest negative parity bands are based on two - proton configurations in orbitals @xmath30 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 as suggested in ref .",

    "of course , the possible assignment for band 12 could also be @xmath98 , as suggested in ref .",
    "however , we were not able to verify this assignment , since the fermion model space for negative parity states with proton and neutron pairs is simply too large for any practical calculation . the experimental spectrum contains another negative parity structure ( band 9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , based on a state @xmath99 at 3182 kev .",
    "the density of calculated negative parity states in this region is very high .",
    "states have strongly mixed wave functions , and we could not find a corresponding theoretical sequence .    in conclusion , we have used an extension of the interacting boson model with broken pairs to describe high - spin dipole bands in transitional nuclei .",
    "the model contains mixed proton - neutron configurations , i.e. proton and neutron broken pairs .",
    "compared with models based on the cranking approximation , the present approach provides several advantages .",

    "a single set of parameters and a well defined hamiltonian are used to calculate collective bands of the core , high - spin two- and four - quasiparticle bands .",
    "polarization effects directly result from the model fermion - boson interactions .",
    "all calculations are performed in the laboratory frame , and therefore the results can be directly compared with experimental data . for the transitional nucleus @xmath0nd , model calculation reproduce the complete experimental excitation spectrum of positive and negative parity states . in particular",
