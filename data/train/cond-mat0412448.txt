    "many social , biological , and communication systems can be properly described as complex networks with nodes representing individuals or organizations and edges mimicking the interactions among them@xcite .",
    "examples are numerous : these include the internet@xcite , the world wide web@xcite , social networks of acquaintance or other relations between individuals@xcite , metabolic networks@xcite , food webs@xcite and many others@xcite .",
    "the ubiquity of complex networks inspires scientists to construct a general model . in the past 200 years ,",
    "the study of topological structures of the networks used to model the interconnection systems has gone through three stages . for over a century , there is an implicit assumption that the interaction patterns among the individuals can be embedded onto a regular structure such as euclidean lattices , hypercube networks , and so on@xcite .",
    "since late 1950s mathematicians began to use random graphs to describe the interconnections , this is the second stage@xcite . in the past few years , with the computerization of data acquisition process and the availability of high computing powers , scientists have found that most real - life networks are neither completely regular nor completely random .",
    "the results of many experiments and statistical analyses indicate that the networks in various fields have some common characteristics , the most important of which are called small - world effect@xcite and scale - free property@xcite .    in a network ,",
    "the distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them .",
    "the average distance @xmath5 of the network , then , is defined as the mean distance between two nodes , averaged over all pairs of nodes .",
    "the average distance is one of the most important parameters to measure the efficiency of communication networks .",
    "for instance , in a store - forward computer network , probably the most useful measurement of its performance is the transmission delay ( or time delay ) encountered by a message travelling through the network from its source to destination ; this is approximately proportional to the number of edges a message must pass through .",
    "thus the average distance plays a significant role in measuring the transmission delay .",
    "the number of the edges incident from a node @xmath6 is called the degree of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 . obviously , through the @xmath7 edges",
    ", there are @xmath7 nodes that are correlated with @xmath6 ; these are called the neighbor - set of @xmath6 , and denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath9 of node @xmath6 is the ratio between the number of edges among @xmath8 and the total possible number , the clustering coefficient @xmath10 of the whole network is the average of @xmath9 over all @xmath6 .",
    "experiments indicate that most real - life networks have much smaller average distance ( as @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the number of nodes in the network ) than the completely regular networks and have much greater clustering coefficient than those of the completely random networks .",
    "therefore they should not be treated as either completely regular or random networks .",
    "the recognition of small - world effect involves the two factors mentioned above : a network is called a small - world network as long as it has small average distance and great clustering coefficient . another important characteristic in real - life networks is the power - law degree distribution , that is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the degree and @xmath14 is the probability density function for the degree distribution .",
    "@xmath15 is called the power - law exponent , and usually between 2 and 3 in real - life networks@xcite .",
    "this power - law distribution falls off much more gradually than an exponential one of a completely random network , allowing for a few nodes of very large degree to exist .",
    "networks with power - law degree distribution are referred to as scale - free networks , although one can and usually does have scales present in other network properties .",
    "[ 0.5 ]    from 1998 much attention has been focused on how to model complex network .",
    "one of the most well - known models is watts and strogatz s small - world network ( ws network ) , which can be constructed by starting with a regular network and randomly moving one endpoint of each edge with probability @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "another popular model was proposed independently by monasson@xcite and by newman and watts(nw networks)@xcite , where no edges are rewired .",
    "some variations of the small - world model have been proposed .",
    "several authors have studied the model in dimension higher than one and obtained similar results to the one dimension case@xcite .",
    "another kind of models in which shortcuts preferentially join nodes that are close together on the underlying lattice also have been studied@xcite .",
    "very recently , zhu et .",
    "proposed a so - called directed dynamical small - world model , in which the network structure is affected by the processes upon the network@xcite .",
    "another significant model is barabsi and albert s scale - free network model ( ba network)@xcite , which is very much similar to prices@xcite .",
    "the ba model suggests that two main ingredients of self - organization of a network in a scale - free structure are growth and preferential attachment . these point to the facts that most networks grow continuously by adding new nodes , which are preferentially attached to existing nodes with large number of neighbors .",
    "the subsequent researches on various processes taking place upon complex networks , such as percolation@xcite , epidemic processes@xcite , cascade processes@xcite and so on , indicate that the scale - free degree distribution plays the most crucial role rather than small - world effect . therefore , in the recent two or three years , the study of modelling complex networks focuses on revealing the underlying mechanism of power - law degree distribution .",
    "roughly , these models for scale - free networks can be classified into 3 main scenarios .",
    "the first one is related to the models of human behavior@xcite and was introduced in a network version under the name  preferential attachment \" mentioned above@xcite .",
    "the second class of models is where a scale - free distribution appears as a result of a balance between a modelled tendency to form hubs against an entropic pressure towards a random network with an exponential degree distribution@xcite .",
    "the third one is the self - organized models that lead to power - law degree distribution@xcite .    in the recent several months ,",
    "a few authors have demonstrated the use of pure mathematical objects and methods to construct scale - free networks .",
    "the first interesting instance is the so - called integer networks@xcite , in which the nodes represent integers and two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath17 are linked by an edge if and only if @xmath6 is divided exactly by @xmath17 or @xmath17 is divided exactly by @xmath6 , where @xmath6 and @xmath17 are nonzero integers .",
    "zhou and wang et al have studied the statistical properties of these networks and demonstrated that they are scale - free networks of large clustering coefficient .",
    "another significant instance is * apollonian networks*(an ) introduced by andrade et al@xcite . in our opinion",
    ", apollonian networks may be not the networks of best performance , but assuredly the most beautiful ones we have ever seen .",
    "another related work is owed to dorogovtsev and mendes et .",
    "al . , in which the deterministic networks , named * pseudofractals * , are obtained by random attachment aiming at edges@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose a simple rule that generates scale - free networks with very large clustering coefficient and very small average distance .",
    "these networks are called * random apollonian networks*(ran ) , since they can be considered as a variation of apollonian networks@xcite .",
    "we discuss the difference between ran and an in detail(in addition , the difference between ran and ba networks ) , and demonstrates that ran perform much better than ba networks in some aspects .",
    "this article is organized as follow : in section 2 , the apollonian networks is introduced , including its fascinating properties and its shortcomings . in section 3 ,",
    "the rule that generates ran is described in detail . in section 4 , we give both the simulation and analytic results about the statistical characteristics of ran , including the scale - free property and the small - world effect , where the detailed analytic processes are shown in appendices . in section 5 , we prove that ran are the maximal planar networks . in section 6 ,",
    "the percolation and epidemic spreading process are also studies and the comparison between ran and ba networks as well as nw networks are shown .",
    "finally , we sum up this article and discuss the relevance of ran to the real world in section 7 .",
    "[ 0.7 ]    apollonian networks , introduced by andrade et al @xcite , are derived from the problem of space - filling packing of spheres according to the ancient greek mathematician apollonius of perga @xcite . to produce an apollonian packing ,",
    "we start with an initial array of touching disks , the interstices of which are curvilinear triangles . in the first generation disks are added inside each interstice in the initial configuration , such that these disks touch each of the disks bounding the curvilinear triangles .",
    "the positions and radii of these disks can easily be calculated , and the circle size distribution follows a power - law with exponent of about 1.3 @xcite .",
    "of course , these added disks can not fill all of the space in the interstices , but instead give rise to three smaller interstices . in the second generation , further disks are added inside all of these new interstices , which again touch the surrounding disks .",
    "this process is then repeated for successive generations .",
    "if we denote the number of generations by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 corresponds to the initial configuration , as @xmath20 the space - filling apollonian packing is obtained as shown in figure 1 .",
    "apollonian packing can be used as a basis of a network , where each disk is a node in the network and nodes are connected if the corresponding disks are in contact .",
    "we call this contact an  apollonian network \" .",
    "figure 2 shows how the network evolves with the addition of new nodes at each generation . for each new disk",
    "added , three new interstices in the packing are created , that will be filled in the next generation .",
    "equivalently , for each new node added , three new triangles are created in the network , into which nodes will be inserted in the next generation .    doye et .",
    "al . have studied the properties of apollonian networks detailedly @xcite , and shown the degree distribution @xmath21 , average length @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath3 is the order @xcite of the network , in other words , apollonian networks are scale - free and display small - world effect .",
    "it is worth remarking that the clustering coefficient @xmath10 is close to 0.828 , much larger than that of ba networks , in the limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "andrade et .",
    "al . have also found many peculiar results about some well - known models upon apollonian networks , including percolation , electrical conduction , and magnetic model@xcite .",
    "[ 0.4 ] the sketch maps for the network growing process .",
    "the four figures show a possible growing process for ran at time @xmath25(a ) , @xmath26(b ) , @xmath27(c ) and @xmath28(d ) . at time",
    "step 1 , the 4th node is added to the network and linked to node 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "then , at time step 2 , the triangle @xmath29 is selected , the 5th node is added inside this triangle and linked to node 1 , 3 and 4 .",
    "after that , the triangles @xmath30 and @xmath31 are selected at time step 3 and 4 , respectively . and node 6 and 7 are added inside these two triangles respectively . the figure 3d shows a random apollonian network of order 7 .",
    "keep on the similar iterations , one can get ran of any orders as he like.,title=\"fig : \" ]    random apollonian network starts with a triangle containing three nodes marked as 1 , 2 and 3 . then , at each time step , a triangle is randomly selected , and a new node is added inside the triangle and linked to the three vertices of this triangle .",
    "the sketch maps for the network growing process are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is clear that , at time step @xmath18 , our network is of order @xmath32 . using this simple rule",
    ", one can get random apollonian network of arbitrary order as he like .",
    "note that the randomicity is involved in our model(that is why we call these networks random apollonian networks ) , the analytic approaches are completely different from the earlier studies on apollonian networks .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the degree distribution is one of the most important statistical characteristics of networks .",
    "since a majority of real - life networks are scale - free networks , whether the networks are of power - law degree distribution is a criterion to judge the validity of the model . in this subsection",
    ", we will give the simulation and analytic results on random apollonian networks degree distribution .",

    "the simulation results agree very well with the analytic one .    by the way , some readers may think the ran are almost the same as ba networks .",
    "indeed , the two ingredients  growth \" and  preferential attachment \" are in common and they have almost the same power - law exponent , but the further simulation and analytic results will show that ran and ba networks are essentially different in some aspects and ran may be closer to reality rather than ba networks .",

    "the curve is above the fitting line when @xmath3 is small(@xmath64 ) and under the fitting line when @xmath3 is large(@xmath65 ) , which indicates that the increasing tendency of @xmath5 can be approximated as @xmath63 and in fact a little slower than @xmath63 .",
    "all the data are obtained by 10 independent simulations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by means of theoretic calculation(see * appendix a * for details ) , we obtain the clustering coefficient of ran with large order @xmath3 as : @xmath66    figure 5 shows the simulation results about the clustering coefficient of ran , which agree very well with the analytic one .",
    "it is remarkable that , the clustering coefficient of ba networks is very small and decreases with the increasing of network order , following approximately a power law @xmath67@xcite(in our simulation , it is found to be about 0.73 ) .",
    "the simulation about clustering coefficient of ba network can also be seen in figure 5 .",
    "since the data - flow patterns show a large amount of clustering in interconnection networks , the ran may perform better than ba networks .",
    "in addition , the demonstration exhibits that most real - life networks have large clustering coefficient no matter how many nodes they have .",
    "that is agree with the case of ran but conflict with the case of ba networks , thus ran may be more appropriate to mimic the reality .",
    "in addition , many real networks including internet , world wide web , and the actor network , are characterized by the existence of hierarchical structure@xcite , which can usually be detected by the negative correlation between the clustering coefficient and the degree .",
    "the ba networks , which does not possess hierarchical structure , is known to have the clustering coefficient @xmath9 of node @xmath6 independent of its degree @xmath7@xcite , while the ran has been shown to have @xmath2(see eq.(a2 ) , in accord with the observations of many real - life networks@xcite . )    in succession , let s discuss the average distance of ran . by means of theoretic approximate calculation(see * appendix b * for details ) , we prove that the increasing tendency of @xmath68 is a little slower than @xmath63 . in figure 6 , we report the simulation results on average distance of ran , which agree with the analytic result well .    in respect that the random apollonian networks are of very large clustering coefficient and very small average distance , they are not only the scale - free networks , but also small - world networks",

    "all the data are averaged over 100 independent simulations.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there are many practical situations in which it is important to decide whether a given network is planar , and if so , to then find a planar embedding of the network .",
    "for example , a very large scale integrated(vlsi ) designer has to place the cells on printed circuit boards according to several designing requirements .",
    "one of these requirements is to avoid crossings since they may lead to undesirable signals .",
    "one is , therefore , interested in knowing if a given electrical network is planar , where the nodes correspond to electrical cells and the edges to the conductor wires connecting the cells .",
    "a network is a planar network if it can be drawn in the plane in such a way that no two edges intersect . putting it a little more rigorously , it is possible to represent it by a drawing in the plane in which the nodes correspond to distinct points and the edges to simple jordan curves connecting the points of its end - points . in this drawing",
    "every two curves are either disjoint or meet only at a common end - point . the above representation of a graph is said to be a plane networks .    in some places",
    ", the networks will perform better when they have more edges .",
    "therefore , how to add more edges into a network but keeping it a planar network is a practical and interesting problem . according to the rule that generates ran , one can immediately find that ran are planar networks .",
    "hereinafter , we will show that the ran are maximal planar networks , which are the planar networks with fixed order who has maximum edges .",
    "if we omit the nodes and edges of a planar networks from the plane , the remainder falls into connected components , called faces@xcite .",
    "clearly , each plane network has exactly one unbounded face and each edge is in the boundary of two faces .",
    "if we draw the graph of a convex polyhedron in the plane , then the faces of the polyhedron clearly correspond to the faces of the plane networks .",
    "this lead to the euler s polyhedron theorem or simply euler s formula@xcite that if a connected plane networks has @xmath76 nodes , @xmath77 edges and @xmath78 faces , then : @xmath79 furthermore , denote @xmath80 the number of faces having exactly @xmath48 edges in their boundaries .",
    "clearly , @xmath81 and since each edge is in the boundary of two faces , we have : @xmath82 combine equ.(8 ) and equ.(9 ) and note that each face has at least 3 edges , we have : @xmath83 then , using euler s formula , one can obtain that : @xmath84 that is to say the maximum number of edges for a planar network with order @xmath76 is @xmath85 .",
    "apparently , the random apollonian network with order @xmath3 has @xmath86 edges on the beam , thus all the ran are maximal planar networks .",
    "as we mentioned above , close to many real - life networks , random apollonian networks are both scale - free and small - world .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate the processes taking place upon ran and directly compare these results with just small - world networks(like ws and nw networks ) and just scale - free networks(like ba networks ) .",
    "these comparisons may give us deep sight into dynamic properties of networks .",
    "in this section , we will exhibit some simulation results on two deeply studied ones , * percolation * and * epidemic spreading process*. since the ws networks may be unconnected , we will use nw networks as exemplifications of small - world networks .      in the year 2000 , albert et .",

    "when such networks are subject to random breakdowns - a fraction @xmath16 of the nodes and their incident edges are removed randomly - their integrity might be compromised : when @xmath16 exceeds a certain threshold , @xmath87 , the network disintegrates into smaller , disconnected fragments . below that critical threshold",

    "infected individuals are assumed to be always infective , which is an approximation that is useful to describe early epidemic stages in which no control measures are deployed . according to eq.(12 ) , one can easily obtain the probability that an susceptible individual @xmath6 will be infected at the present time step is : @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the number of infected individuals at time step @xmath113 in @xmath6 s neighbor - set @xmath8 .",
    "we start by selecting one node randomly and assume it is infected . the diseases or computer virus will spread in the networks in according with the rule of eq.(13 ) . in figure 9 , we plot the average density over 1000 independent runs in ran , ba and nw networks with @xmath70 and @xmath71 fixed .",
    "obviously , all the individuals will be infected in the limit of long time as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the density of infected individuals at time step @xmath18 .",
    "more over , the simulation results indicate that the diseases spread more quickly in ba networks than ran , as well as in ran than nw networks . to make the outcome more clear , we have calculated the diseases spreading velocity , which is defined as : @xmath116    figure 10 shows the spreading velocity vs time in ran , ba and nw networks with @xmath70 and @xmath117 .",
    "the spreading velocity reaches a peak quickly . before the peak - time",
    ", the spreading velocities of the three kinds of networks satisfy the inequality : @xmath118 the result that diseases spread more quickly in ran and ba networks than in nw networks is easy to be understood as the well - known conclusion : boarder degree distribution will speed up the epidemic spreading process@xcite .",
    "why the diseases spread more quickly in ba networks than ran is a very interesting question .",
    "we argue that the larger clustering coefficient may slow down the epidemic spreading process especially in the outbreaks .",
    "for an arbitrary edge @xmath119 , containing two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath17 , obviously , the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath17 is @xmath120 .",
    "remove the edge @xmath119 from quondam network , then , the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath17 will increase @xmath121(if the removal of @xmath119 makes @xmath6 and @xmath17 disconnected , then we set @xmath122 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath123 can be considered as edge @xmath119 s score @xmath124 , denoting the number of edges the diseases must pass through from @xmath6 to @xmath17 or form @xmath17 to @xmath6 if they do not pass across @xmath119 . if @xmath125 is small",
    ", then @xmath119 only plays a local role in the epidemic spreading process , else when @xmath125 is large , @xmath119 is of global importance . for each edge @xmath119 , if it does some contribution to clustering coefficient , it must be contained in at least one triangle and @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , networks of larger clustering coefficient have more * local edges*. ran and ba networks are two extreme ones of scale - free networks . in ran ,",
    "all the edges are of score 2 ; while in ba networks , almost all the edges are of score larger than 2 because the clustering coefficient of ba networks will decay to zero quickly as @xmath3 increases .",
    "consequently , diseases spread more quickly in ba networks than ran .",
    "the above explanation is qualitative and rough , to study the process upon networks with tunable clustering coefficient@xcite may be useful for the present problem , which will be one of the future works .",
    "in conclusion , in respect that the random apollonian networks are of very large clustering coefficient and very small average distance , they are not only the scale - free networks , but also small - world networks",
    ". since most real - life networks are both scale - free and small - world networks , ran may perform better in mimicking reality rather than ws networks and ba networks .",
    "in addition , ran possess hierarchical structure that in accord with the observations of many real networks and we propose an analytic approach to calculate clustering coefficient .",
    "since in the earlier studies , only few analytic results about clustering coefficient of networks with randomicity are reported@xcite , we believe that our work may enlightened readers on this subject .",
    "further more , we briefly introduce the conception of planar network(it is also called  planar graph \" in mathematical language ) , and prove that ran are maximal planar networks , which are of particular practicability for layout of printed circuits and so on . although whether a network is planar or not is a natural and important question that attracts much attention for mathematicians , it seems not interesting for physicists and almost no pertinent results are reported in the earlier studies on complex networks .",
    "but in fact , many real - life networks are planar networks by reason of technical or natural requirements , such as layout of printed circuits , river networks upon the earth s surface , vas networks clinging to cutis , and so forth .",
    "since the planar networks have some graceful characteristics that can not be found in non - planar ones , researchers ought to pay more attention to networks planarity .",
    "we wish our abecedarian work to stimulate physicists thinking more of planarity .",
    "the percolation and epidemic spreading process are also studies and the comparison between ran and ba as well as nw networks are shown . in percolation model , we find that , when the network order @xmath3 is relatively small(as @xmath4 ) , the performance of ran under intentional attack is not sensitive to @xmath3 , while that of ba networks is much affected by @xmath3 . in epidemic spreading process , the diseases spread slower in ran than ba networks during the outbreaks , indicating that the large clustering coefficient may slower the spreading velocity especially in the outbreaks .",
    "we give some qualitative explanation about how the clustering structure affect the spreading process in the outbreaks , but why ran and ba networks display completely different susceptivity to order changing is even a problem puzzling us .",
    "those simulation results suggest that the clustering structure may affect the dynamical behavior upon networks much .",
    "since many real - life networks are of great clustering coefficient , to study the process upon networks with tunable clustering coefficient@xcite is significant .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the state key development programme of basic research ( 973 project ) of china , the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . 70471033 , 10472116 and no.70271070 , the specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education ( srfdp no.20020358009 ) , and the foundation for graduate students of university of science and technology of china under grant no .",

    "at first , let us consider the clustering coefficient @xmath9 of an arbitrary node @xmath6 except the nodes 1 , 2 and 3 . at the very time when node @xmath6 is added to the network , it is of degree 3 and @xmath127 .",
    "after , if the degree of node @xmath6 increases by one(i.e .",
    "a new node is added to be a neighbor of @xmath6 ) at some time step , then @xmath61 will increases by two since the newly added node will link to two of the neighbors of node @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we can write down the expression of @xmath61 in terms of @xmath7 : @xmath128 using equ.(5 ) , we can get the clustering coefficient of node @xmath6 as : @xmath129 consequently , we have : @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the degree of the @xmath48th node .",
    "rewrite @xmath132 in continuous form : @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 denote the minimal and maximal degree in ran , respectively .",
    "then , equ.(a3 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath136 in section 4 , we have proved that @xmath137 with @xmath0 and @xmath138 a constant , thus one can write down the expression that : @xmath139 note that @xmath140 , one can immediately obtain the value of @xmath10 as :    @xmath141    it is clear that @xmath142 and for sufficient large @xmath3 , @xmath143 , and @xmath138 satisfy the normalization equation : @xmath144 therefore , @xmath145 and @xmath1 .",
    "at first , let s prove an interesting property about the shortest paths in ran . marked each node according to the time when the node is added to the network(see figure 3 ) , then we have the following lemma :    * lemma : * for any two nodes @xmath48 and @xmath146 , each shortest path from @xmath48 to @xmath146(@xmath147 ) does not pass through any nodes @xmath13 satisfying that @xmath148 .",
    "+ _ proof .",
    "_ using nodes sequence @xmath149 to denote the shortest path from @xmath48 to @xmath146 of length @xmath150 . obviously , @xmath151 is the trivial case .",
    "suppose that @xmath152 and @xmath153 , if @xmath154 , then the proposition is true .    in succession , we prove that the case @xmath155 would not come forth .",
    "suppose that the triangle @xmath156 is selected when node @xmath157 is added . since @xmath155 ,",
    "neither @xmath48 nor @xmath146 is inside the triangle @xmath156 .",
    "hence the path from @xmath48 to @xmath146 passing through @xmath157 must enter into and leave @xmath156 .",
    "we may assume that the path enter into @xmath156 by node @xmath158 and leave from node @xmath159 , then there exists a subpath of @xmath147 from @xmath158 to @xmath159 passing through @xmath157 , which is apparently longer than the direct path @xmath160",
    ". hence if @xmath147 is the shortest path , the youngest node must be either @xmath48 or @xmath146 . @xmath161    using symbol @xmath162 to represent the distance between @xmath48 and @xmath146 , the average distance of ran with order @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath68 , is defined as : @xmath163 where the total distance is",
    ": @xmath164    according to the lemma , newly added node will not affect the distance between old nodes .",
    "hence we have : @xmath165 assume that the node @xmath166 is added into the triangle @xmath167 , then the equ.(b3 ) can be rewritten as : @xmath168 where @xmath169 .",
    "constrict @xmath156 continuously into a single node @xmath17 , then we have @xmath170 .",

    "the sum @xmath175 can be considered as the total distance from one node @xmath17 to all the other nodes in ran with order @xmath176 . in a rough version ,",

    "<S> in this article , we propose a simple rule that generates scale - free networks with very large clustering coefficient and very small average distance . </S>",
    "<S> these networks are called * random apollonian networks*(ran ) as they can be considered as a variation of apollonian networks . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the analytic results of power - law exponent @xmath0 and clustering coefficient @xmath1 , which agree very well with the simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the increasing tendency of average distance of ran is a little slower than the logarithm of the number of nodes in ran . </S>",
    "<S> since most real - life networks are both scale - free and small - world networks , ran may perform well in mimicking the reality . </S>",
    "<S> the ran possess hierarchical structure as @xmath2 that in accord with the observations of many real - life networks . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we prove that ran are maximal planar networks , which are of particular practicability for layout of printed circuits and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the percolation and epidemic spreading process are also studies and the comparison between ran and barabsi - albert(ba ) as well as newman - watts(nw ) networks are shown . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , when the network order @xmath3(the total number of nodes ) is relatively small(as @xmath4 ) , the performance of ran under intentional attack is not sensitive to @xmath3 , while that of ba networks is much affected by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> and the diseases spread slower in ran than ba networks during the outbreaks , indicating that the large clustering coefficient may slower the spreading velocity especially in the outbreaks . </S>"
