    "a bell inequality is an inequality containing probabilities of measurement results that will be obeyed by probabilities resulting from a local , realistic theory @xcite .",
    "initial interest in them was confined to people working in the foundations of quantum mechanics , but more recently they have provided the basis for protocols in quantum cryptography and for tests of entanglement .",
    "there is now an extensive literature on the subject , and considerable progress has been made in classifying and tabulating bell inequalities .",
    "two recent reviews provide a good overview of the field @xcite .",
    "the standard scenario for a bell inequality is that there are @xmath0 parties making measurements , each party can make one of @xmath1 possible measurements , and each measurement has @xmath2 outcomes .",
    "perhaps the most famous bell inequality , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality , is for the case @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "kaszlikowsi , et al .  showed that by increasing the number of outcomes , @xmath2 , one could more strongly violate local realism @xcite .",
    "the case of full correlation bell inequalities for @xmath4 and general @xmath0 has been fully characterized by werner and wolf @xcite .",
    "bell inequalities for the case @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and general @xmath2 were found by collins , et al .",
    "@xcite , and this was generalized to the case of general @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and general @xmath2 by son , et .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , an approach to bell inequalities based on graph theory was developed by cabello , severini , and winter @xcite .",
    "the vertices of a graph correspond to events , where an event is a particular choice of measurement and a measurement outcome for each party .",
    "the probabilities of these events are what appear in the inequality , in particular their sum .",
    "two vertices are connected by an edge if the events corresponding to them can not be true simultaneously .",
    "the properties of the graph can be used to find an upper bound to the classical sum of the probabilities , that is the sum when the probabilities come from a local , realistic theory , and also an upper bound to the quantum sum , where the probabilities come from quantum mechanics .    in a previous paper",
    ", we explored an approach to bell inequalities based on group actions of single generator abelian groups @xcite . in that case",
    "the bell inequalities also involve sums of the probabilities of events , but instead of starting from a graph , we start from a group .",
    "the events are generated by the application of operators that form a representation of a group to an initial state .",
    "as an example , suppose we have two parties , alice and bob , and they each have a qubit so that their joint states are elements of a tensor product hilbert space , @xmath7",
    ". we will denote the computational , or @xmath8 , basis of @xmath9 by @xmath10 and the @xmath11 basis by @xmath12 .",
    "consider the operator @xmath13 , and note that @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we have that @xmath16 is a representation of the cyclic group @xmath17 , the group of addition modulo @xmath18 , and so is @xmath19 .",
    "the map from @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the state @xmath22 is an example of a group action @xcite .",
    "the definition of a group action is the following .",
    "if @xmath23 is a group and @xmath24 is a set , a group action is a function @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 is the identity element of the group .",
    "the subset of @xmath24 given by @xmath30 is called the orbit of @xmath11 .",
    "any two orbits are either distinct or identical , so the set of orbits forms a partition of @xmath24 . in the case of our example , the orbits will be sets of the form @xmath31 .",
    "now let us set @xmath32 , in which case the orbit is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "define the observables for alice to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 and similarly for bob , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the orbit then corresponds to the events @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "we can also choose a second orbit starting with the state @xmath44 , which generates four more events .",
    "we will not demonstrate this here ( a closely related example appeared in @xcite ) , but the sum of the probabilities for these eight events can not be larger than @xmath45 if the probabilities come from a local realistic theory , whereas it can reach the value of @xmath46 if the probabilities come from quantum mechanics .    in this paper",
    "we would like to extend these results in two directions .",
    "first , we previously only considered the case of two parties . in the next section",
    "we again consider cyclic groups but for the case of three parties . in the following section , we go back to the case of two parties , but look at non - abelian groups , in particular dihedral groups . we compare the nonlocal games that result from bell inequalities for the cyclic group @xmath47 and the dihedral group @xmath48 , both of which have @xmath49 members .",
    "finally , we show how group representation theory can be used to find quantum states that violate a bell inequality that results from the dihedral group @xmath50 , a group with @xmath51 members .",
    "we shall consider a scenario in which three parties , alice , bob , and charlie , share a system of three particles , each party possessing one of the particles .",
    "each of them can measure one of two observables , and for each observable the possible values for the result of the measurement are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 .",
    "alice s observables are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , bob s are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and charlie s are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    in the quantum mechanical version of this scenario , alice , bob , and charlie , each has a qutrit .",
    "the computational basis is @xmath61 and corresponds to the observables @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath59 ; for example , @xmath62 , and similarly for @xmath57 and @xmath59 . in order to define a second basis , consider the operator @xmath63 where @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we have that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , and the addition is modulo @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath68 , which implies that @xmath69 is a representation of the group @xmath47 , addition modulo @xmath49 .",
    "we now define a second basis , @xmath70 , and this basis corresponds to the observables @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath60 , where , for example , @xmath71 .",
    "each of the three parties can measure their qutrit in either of the two bases .",
    "we now choose four states , and apply to each of them the operator @xmath72 , for @xmath73 , which generates a total of @xmath74 states .",
    "the four states are : latexmath:[\\[\\label{3-party - orbits }    note that in the first state all three bases are the same , in the second , the first two bases are the same , in the third , the first and third bases are the same , and in the fourth the second and third bases are the same .",
    "this feature remains the same under application of @xmath72 , so , for example , for all states generated by application of this operator to the first state the bases will be the same .",
    "note that these basis combinations exhaust all possible choices of measurement bases by the parties . because there are only two measurement bases , either each party chooses the same basis or two of them do and the third party chooses a different one .",
    "this second alternative can happen in three different ways .",
    "this results in @xmath74 three - qutrit states each of which is a product of single - qutrit states from one of the two bases .",
    "note that @xmath76 is also a representation of @xmath47 .",
    "application of these operators to @xmath77 defines a group action , and the set resulting from the application of all six operators to a particular state defines the orbit associated with that state .",
    "two orbits are either distinct or identical .",
    "each of the four states in eq .",
    "( [ 3-party - orbits ] ) generates an orbit .",
    "these states were found by means of a random search in the set of states that are threefold tensor products of the states in the computational and @xmath78 bases .",
    "the search identified sets of states whose orbits lead to bell inequality violations .",
    "more details of how the random searches in this paper are performed can be found in appendix a.    each of the @xmath74 states in our set corresponds to a particular choice of measurements by the three parties and a particular set of measurement results .",
    "for example , the state @xmath79 corresponds to alice measuring @xmath55 and obtaining @xmath52 , bob measuring @xmath57 and obtaining @xmath52 , and charlie measuring @xmath60 and obtaining @xmath53 . in order to maximize the sum of probabilities corresponding to these measurement choices and the specified results , we need to find the state , @xmath80 , that maximizes the expectation value @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 the expectation value of @xmath84 in the state @xmath80 is just the sum of the 24 probabilities if alice , bob , and charlie share the three - qutrit state @xmath80 .",
    "the largest value of the expectation value occurs when @xmath80 is the eigenstate of @xmath84 corresponding to its largest eigenvalue .",
    "we want to find the largest eigenvalue of @xmath84 , but before proceeding let us note something that will simplify the calculation .",
    "if we define @xmath85 then we see that the eigenstates of @xmath86 are states of the form @xmath87 , and the possible eigenvalues are @xmath53 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , all of which are degenerate .",
    "let @xmath91 be the projection onto the subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue , @xmath92 , of @xmath86 .",
    "because @xmath93=0 $ ] , we have that @xmath94 therefore , in order to diagonalize @xmath84 we only have to diagonalize it within the subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues of @xmath86 .",
    "we find that the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath84 lies in the subspace where @xmath86 has an eigenvalue of @xmath53 .",
    "this space is seven dimensional , so we are faced with diagonalizing a seven - dimensional matrix .",
    "however , because of the form of the matrix , @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , the problem can be reduced to a four - dimensional one .",
    "if we express the eigenvector as @xmath100 , then the eigenvalue equation becomes @xmath101 finding the overlaps of the vectors , we obtain @xmath102 the largest eigenvalue is @xmath103 , which gives @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 3-party - proj ] ) ) as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvector is given in the computational basis by @xmath105 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximum value of the sum of the classical probabilities is @xmath54 , so we get a violation .",
    "the classical bound is found by assuming that there is a joint distribution for all of the variables,@xmath106 .",
    "then each of the @xmath74 measurement probabilities can be expressed in terms of joint distribution , and their sum can be expressed as @xmath107 where the @xmath108 are integers .",
    "the sum is maximized when the probability distribution is chosen to have the value @xmath53 for one of the values of @xmath109 corresponding to the largest value of @xmath110 , which implies that the maximum value of the sum is just the maximum value of @xmath110 . in this case",
    "we find that the largest value is @xmath54 , which is , therefore , the largest value the sum of the probabilities can assume .",
    "it is also possible to phrase this inequality as a nonlocal game .",
    "alice , bob , and charlie each receive a bit , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , respectively , where @xmath114 or @xmath53 from an arbitrator .",
    "each then transmits to the arbitrator , a @xmath52 , a @xmath53 , or a @xmath54 .",
    "the arbitrator then decides whether they have won the game .",
    "the wining conditions depend on both @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 and the values returned by alice , bob and charlie . for this game ,",
    "the winning conditions are listed in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath115 are listed on the left , and the corresponding winning combinations of the values sent by alice , bob and charlie are listed on the right .",
    "the values of @xmath115 are grouped according to which of the values are the same .",
    "the first two have all the values the same , the next two have their first two values the same , the next two have the first and third values the same , and the last two have the second and third values the same .",
    "the sum of the digits in the winning sequences modulo @xmath45 in each row are the same , @xmath52 in rows @xmath116 , @xmath53 in rows @xmath117 , and @xmath54 in rows @xmath118 .",
    "next , we move on to the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the operator @xmath84 for the group @xmath50 given in eq .",
    "( [ d6-a ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the @xmath119 subspace have already been discussed in the text .",
    "the @xmath120 and @xmath121 subspaces are straightforward , since these representations only appear once in the decomposition of @xmath122 and we can use eq .",
    "( [ same - carrier ] ) .",
    "for @xmath120 we find that the component of @xmath123 in this subspace is @xmath124 while the component of @xmath125 is just @xmath126 .",
    "the eigenvalue corresponding to the @xmath120 space is then @xmath127 .",
    "the components of @xmath123 and @xmath125 in the @xmath121 subspace are @xmath128 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath129 as the eigenvalue corresponding to @xmath121 , and this eigenvalue is two - fold degenerate .",
    "the @xmath130 subspace is more complicated .",
    "it is four dimensional and consists of two copies of the @xmath130 irreducible representation .",
    "we first note that because @xmath131 is invariant under the actions of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the states @xmath134 and @xmath135 transform in the same way , and the states @xmath136 and @xmath137 transform in the same way .",
    "now suppose that @xmath138 is a vector in the @xmath130 subspace .",
    "setting @xmath139 and @xmath140 , for @xmath141 , we find from eq .",
    "( [ two - irreps - final ] ) , that @xmath142 where the matrix is in the @xmath143 basis , and @xmath144 the component of @xmath123 transforming as @xmath130 is @xmath145 and the component of @xmath125 transforming as @xmath130 is @xmath146 for both @xmath147 and @xmath148 we find @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
