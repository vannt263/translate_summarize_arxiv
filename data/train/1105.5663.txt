    "in @xcite _ virtual knots and links _ and equivalently _ abstract knots links _ respectively were introduced .",
    "virtual knots were initially conceived as combinatorial objects , reidemeister equivalence classes of gauss codes , where abstract knots were geometric in nature , knot diagrams drawn on minimalistic supporting surfaces . in @xcite a geometric interpretation of virtual and abstract links as isotopy classes of simple closed curves in @xmath0-bundles over compact oriented surfaces modulo stabilization moves was developed .    in recent work such as @xcite ,",
    "virtual and abstract links are extended to allow compact non - orientable supporting surfaces ; the resulting links are called _ twisted virtual links_. invariants of twisted virtual links such as the twisted jones polynomial and the twisted knot group have been introduced and studied .",
    "twisted virtual knot theory is very new , with many interesting open questions , such as finding a supporting surface of minimal genus for a given twisted virtual knot or link .",
    "quandle- and biquandle - based invariants of twisted virtual links were first considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a counting invariant of unframed oriented classical and virtual knots and links was defined using labelings by finite racks and extended to finite biracks in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the birack counting invariant to the case of twisted virtual links .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ tvl ] we recall the basics of twisted virtual link theory from @xcite and make a few observations which will be useful in later sections . in section [ tvb ]",
    "we recall twisted virtual biracks give some examples . in section [ inv ]",
    "we define the twisted virtual birack counting invariant and provide examples and sample computations of the invariant . as an application , we classify twist structures on the virtual hopf link .",
    "we end with a few open questions for future research in section [ q ] .",
    "_ twisted virtual links _ were introduced in @xcite and subsequently studied in works such as @xcite .",
    "twisted virtual links extend the concept of _ virtual links _ from previous work @xcite ; where virtual links arise by drawing link diagrams on compact orientable surfaces with nonzero genus , twisted virtual links arise when we draw link diagrams on compact surfaces allowing nonzero genus and nonzero cross - cap number .",
    "knot and link diagrams are usually drawn on flat paper without explicitly specifying a supporting surface @xmath2 on which the knot diagram is drawn . if we do explicitly draw @xmath2 , we have a _ link - surface _ diagram .",
    "often we will remove a disk from @xmath3 so we can flatten @xmath2 as depicted .",
    "virtual crossings correspond to crossed bands while classical crossings correspond to crossings drawn on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath4    geometrically , a twisted virtual link is a stable equivalence class of simple closed curves in an @xmath0-bundle , i.e. an ambient space obtained by thickening the surface @xmath2 on which the link diagram is drawn . here",
    "`` stable equivalence '' means that in addition to ambient isotopy of the link within the thickened surface , we can _ stabilize _ the surface @xmath2 by adding or deleting torus summands or cross caps not containing the link .",
    "if we remove a disk from @xmath3 and flatten the resulting @xmath5 in the usual way to get @xmath6 then stabilization moves have the form @xmath7    we can represent twisted virtual links combinatorially without having to draw the supporting surface @xmath2 by representing crossings arising from genus in @xmath2 with circled self - intersections known as _ virtual crossings _ ( see @xcite ) and representing places where our link traverses a cross cap in @xmath2 with a small bar .",

    "semiarcs_. for instance , the twisted virtual hopf link diagram above has six semiarcs .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that stable isotopy of twisted virtual links corresponds to the equivalence relation on twisted virtual link diagrams generated by the _ twisted virtual reidemeister moves _ :    @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    each of these moves can be understood in terms of link - surface diagrams or abstract link diagrams ; for instance , the last move looks like : @xmath14    note that we do not need twist bars covering multiple strands since for any two neighboring strands going through a twisted band , we can remove a disc from the surface between the strands and replace the multi - strand bar with two bars and a virtual crossing : @xmath15    the four virtual moves together imply the _ detour move _ , which says that a strand with only virtual crossings can be moved past any tangle containing classical or virtual crossings ; move ti implies that strands with only virtual crossings can detour past twist bars as well .",
    "@xmath16    replacing the usual classical reidemeister type i move with the blackboard framed type i moves @xmath17 yields _ blackboard framed twisted virtual isotopy_. including orientations on the link components gives _ oriented blackboard framed twisted virtual isotopy_.    we will primarily be interested in using invariants of oriented blackboard framed twisted virtual isotopy to define an invariant of oriented unframed twisted virtual isotopy analogous to those defined in @xcite and @xcite",

    "let us define a _",

    "rack labelings of blackboard framed classical links , etc .",
    ", an @xmath22-labeling of a twisted virtual link diagram @xmath10 can be understood as a homomorphism @xmath37 of twisted virtual biracks where @xmath38 is the _ fundamental twisted virtual birack _ of @xmath10 defined below .",

    "starting with a virtual link diagram , it natural to ask which placements of twist bars yield distinct twisted virtual links . in light of moves",

    "@xmath50    @xmath51    finally , we note that as in the case of biracks , we have several enhancements of the twisted virtual birack counting invariant .",
    "an _ enhancement _ associates an @xmath22-labeled move invariant signature to each labeling of a twisted virtual link diagram so that instead of simply counting labelings , we collect the signatures to get a multiset whose cardinality recovers the counting invariant but is in general a stronger invariant .",
    "we usually convert the multiset into a polynomial for ease of comparison by taking a generating function .",
    "the standard enhancements include the following :    * _ image enhancement .",
