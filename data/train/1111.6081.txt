    "the gluon self - coupling in qcd opens the possibility of existing bound states of pure gauge fields known as glueballs ( @xmath3 ) , which are predicted by several theoretical formalisms and by lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "many mesons have stood up as good candidates for the lightest glueball in the spectrum and in particular the scalar sector ( @xmath4 ) seems promising .",
    "the mesons @xmath0 and the @xmath1 have been considered the principal candidates for the scalar glueball@xcite . however , in this mass region the glueball state will mix strongly with nearby @xmath5 states @xcite .",
    "more recently , the bes collaboration observed a new resonance called @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recently , the clean topologies of exclusive particle production in electromagnetic interactions hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus collisions mediated by colorless exchanges such the qcd pomeron or two photons have attracted an increasing interest @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for these processes are smaller than the correspondent inclusive production channels , which it is compensated by a more favorable signal / background relation .",
    "experimentally , exclusive events are identified by large rapidity gaps on both sides of the produced central system and the survival of both initial state particles scattered at very forward angles with respect to the beam .    in this contribution",
    ", we summarize some results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite on exclusive glueball production in two - photon and pomeron - pomeron interactions in coherent nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "we also present new results for the proton - proton collisions at 7 tev . in the two - photon channel , the photon flux scales as the square charge of the beam , @xmath6 , and",
    "then the corresponding cross section is highly enhanced by a factor @xmath7 for gold or lead nuclei .",
    "a competing channel , which produces similar final state configuration , is the central diffraction ( cd ) process .",
    "such a reaction is modeled in general by two - pomeron interaction .",
    "one goal of the present investigation is to compare the cross sections for these two channels in the production of glueball candidates .",
    "let us start with the glueball candidate production in photon - photon scattering at coherent heavy ion collisions using the weizscker - williams approximation ( epa approximation ) .",
    "in such an approach , the cross section for a two quasi - real photon process to produce a glueball state , @xmath3 , at center - of - mass energy @xmath8 factorises into the product of the elementary cross section for @xmath9 convoluted with the equivalent photon spectra from the colliding ions @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the photon energies and @xmath12 is the photon flux at the energy @xmath13 emmited by the hadron @xmath14 .",
    "the photon energies determine the center - of - mass energy @xmath15 and the rapidity @xmath16 of the produced system .",

    "in addition , @xmath19 is the center - of - mass energy of the ion - ion system and the lorentz relativistic factor is given by @xmath20 . in the numerical calculations we use @xmath21 tev and @xmath22 for the lhc .",
    "we also will present prediction for the alice run at @xmath23 tev ( see table 1 )    in the epa approximation , the flux of equivalent photons from a relativistic particle of charge @xmath24 is determined from the fourier transform of its electromagnetic field . for an extended charge with electromagnetic form factor , @xmath25 , the energy spectrum can be computed as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fraction of the beam energy carried by the photon and @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the four - momentum transfer squared from the charge , with @xmath31 .",
    "the glueball production in two - photon fusion can be calculated using the narrow resonance approximation @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the partial two - photon decay width of @xmath3 , @xmath34 is the glueball mass and @xmath35 is the spin of the state @xmath3 . here , we compute the production rates for the mesons @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the reason is due to they have been mentioned as possible glueball candidates by phenomenologists @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the two - photon component are in practice somewhat difficult as the branching ratios have not been measured . to compute numerical values for the meson ( glueball ) cross section in two - photon reactions",
    "estimates for the two - photon decay widths are needed .",
    "the determination of them depend upon whether the meson state is a pure quarkonium , pure gluonic or a mixed hybrid state . a detailed discussion for the main fetures in each case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was verified that the pure glueball production gives the lowest cross section .",
    "accordingly , the estimates for the two - photon width for a pure glueball resonance are @xmath38 ev , @xmath39 ev and @xmath40 kev . the widths are about three orders of magnitude smaller that for pure @xmath5 states .",
    "therefore , as the two - photon cross section scales as @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ twophotres ] ) , one can consider the experimental feasibility of using peripheral heavy - ion collisions to determine the nature of the resonances discussed above .",
    "let us now focus on the pomeron - pomeron channel .",
    "in particular , we consider the central diffraction ( double pomeron exchange , dpe ) in nucleus - nucleus interactions . as a starting point",
    "we compute the dpe proton - proton cross section making use of the bialas - landshoff @xcite approach .",
    "it is believed that this non - perturbative approach is a reasonable choice due to the light mass of glueballs candidates considered and we are interested in the central exclusive dpe production of glueball states . in the exclusive dpe event",
    "the central object @xmath3 is produced alone , separated from the outgoing hadrons by rapidity gaps , @xmath42 . in approach",
    "we are going to use , pomeron exchange corresponds to the exchange of a pair of non - perturbative gluons which takes place between a pair of colliding quarks .",

    "the standard pomeron regge trajectory is given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath48 gev@xmath49 .",
    "the momenta of incoming ( outgoing ) protons are labeled by @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , whereas the glueball momentum is denoted by @xmath54 .",

    "the factor @xmath68 takes the gap survival effect into account @xmath69 the probability ( @xmath70 ) of the gaps not to be populated by secondaries produced in the soft rescattering . for our purpose here",
    ", we will consider @xmath71 at @xmath72 tev in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "following @xcite we find @xmath44 for colliding hadrons , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the transverse momentum carried by each of the three gluons .",

    "the situation is less clear due to small information on its decaying channels in radiative @xmath85 decays . here",

    "as discussed in @xcite , a consequence on the small deviation for the branching fraction in pure @xmath5 and glueball resonance is the difficulty in testing their nature using the exclusive diffractive data .    in order to calculate the @xmath98 cross section the procedure presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is considered , where the central diffraction and single diffraction cross sections in nucleus - nucleus collisions are computed using the so - called _ criterion c _ ( we quote ref . @xcite for further details ) . using the profile function for two colliding nuclei , @xmath99 , the final expression for cd cross section in @xmath98 collisions",

    "using woods - saxon nuclear densities and considering the inelastic cross section @xmath103 mb for lhc energy , @xmath104 tev , we compute the cd cross section for nuclear collisions . the values for the inelastic cross section are obtained from @xmath105 @xcite , where the scattering amplitude is parameterized using @xmath106 , @xmath107 and elastic slope ( these parameters are taken as fitted by the @xmath108 model @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that for lhc energy the effective atomic number dependence is proportional to @xmath109 , which means that the nuclear cd cross section is only one order of magnitude larger than the nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "in what follows , we compare the two production channels and investigate the main theoretical uncertainties .",

    "the cross sections for glueball candidates production in photon - photon fusion at energy of @xmath72 tev for lead - lead collisions are shown .",
    "the cross sections are sufficiently large for experimental measurement .",
    "the event rates can be obtained using the beam luminosity @xcite : for lhc one has @xmath110 cm@xmath49s@xmath112 , which produces the following number of events .",

    "the pomeron contribution can be separated from photon channel by imposing a cut on the impact parameter of collision . after imposing this kinematic cut ( @xmath131 ) the pomeron contribution is reduced as they are dominated by small impact parameter contributions @xcite . as a final remark , it is important to discuss the uncertainties on the current calculations and the experimental feasibility of detecting glueballs candidates .",
    "the main uncertainty here is the model dependence on obtaining the two - photon and the two - gluon widths for a pure glueball meson .",

    ". we did not discuss the implication of those findings in present calculation .",
    "concerning the experimental detection , the advantage of the exclusive processes discussed here is clear : glueballs are probably being produced with a high cross section in inelastic collisions ( in @xmath132 or @xmath98 reactions ) but when the multiplicity is high the combinatorial background is overwhelming . in _ exclusive _ production there is no combinatorial background . in the ultraperipheral two - photon production of glueballs ,",
    "the final state configuration is clear : nuclei remain intact after collision and a double large rapidity gap between them is present ( glueball is centrally produced with a low @xmath133 transverse momenta spectrum ) .",
    "this type of measurement is already done at rhic for photoproduction of vector mesons and exclusive dilepton production with a signal identification well understood @xcite .",
    "the situation for dpe glueball production is similar , with the @xmath133 spectrum being broader than the processes initiated by two - photons .",
    "thus , a transverse momentum cut ( and also impact parameter of collision ) could separate the two channels .",
