    "a number of studies have been performed that show approximately 3.5@xmath3 hemispherical power asymmetry at large scales in wmap and planck cmb temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used a conceptually simple pixel space _ local variance _ method to demonstrate the presence of asymmetry at large scales in wmap and planck data at a significance of at least @xmath2 ; they find that none of the 1000 isotropic planck ffp6 simulations had a local variance dipole amplitude equal to or greater than that found in data for disk radii @xmath4 . in this method , a local variance map ( @xmath5 ) is generated at a smaller healpix @xcite resolution @xmath6 from a higher resolution cmb temperature fluctuations map by computing temperature variance inside disks of certain radius @xmath7 centered at the center of each pixel of the healpix map with resolution @xmath6 .",
    "isotropic simulations are used to get the expected mean map ( @xmath8 ) , and each map is normalized:@xmath9 then , we obtain local variance dipoles by fitting for dipoles in each of these normalized maps ( both simulations and planck data ) using the healpix ` remove_dipole ` module with inverse variance ( of the 1000 simulated local variance maps ) weighting . in this paper",
    ", we will denote the amplitude of a local variance dipole as @xmath10 .",
    "the local variance dipole obtained from data is then compared to the distributions obtained from simulations .    in this work",
    ", we make use of the local variance method and extend the results obtained in @xcite to include smaller disk radii .",
    "the authors in @xcite focused on large scale power asymmetry , and therefore only looked at large values of @xmath7 . after confirming their results at large disk radii ( @xmath11 )",
    ", we perform the same local variance dipole analysis using smaller disk sizes .",
    "we find that , for smaller disk radii , the contribution of the _ doppler dipole _ becomes increasingly significant .",
    "the doppler dipole in the local variance map is an expected signal because of our velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame .",
    "while the direction and magnitude of the cmb dipole has been known from previous cmb experiments @xcite , the doppler dipole signal in the temperature fluctuations is rather weak and reported only recently by the planck collaboration @xcite using harmonic space estimators @xcite .",
    "we work towards detecting the expected doppler dipole in the local variance maps after removing large scale features from the maps .",
    "our goal therefore is two fold : first , extend the local variance dipole study of the hemispherical power asymmetry to smaller disk radii and second , use the method of local variance to detect the doppler dipole whose amplitude is much smaller but is expected to contribute at all angular scales .    before presenting the details of the analysis and results",
    ", we would like to point out and clarify a difference between our analysis and that of akrami et al .",
    "they used 3072 disks ( @xmath12 healpix map ) for all sizes of disks they considered ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , we find that for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , 3072 disks are not enough to cover the whole sky .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath16 ( 12288 disks ) for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( 49152 disks ) for @xmath14 . once we do this , we find that , unlike the results in akrami et al .",
    "( see fig 2(a ) and table 1 in @xcite ) , none of our 1000 isotropic simulations produce a local variance dipole amplitude larger than that of our foreground cleaned channel maps , for @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the effect of the anomalous dipole ( with respect to the isotropic case ) can be observed for even smaller angular disk radii ( see figure [ fig : subdegrees ] ) .",
    "this result , however , is not surprising because the local variance dipoles computed at smaller disk radii get some contribution from the large scale anomalous power asymmetry at low @xmath20 .",
    "next , in section [ sec : sim ] we discuss in some detail the planck cmb data and simulations used in this paper .",
    "then , in section [ sec : results ] we present our results for both the anomalous dipole and the doppler dipole , followed by discussions and a summary of our results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "for our analysis , we use 1000 realizations of ffp6 planck simulations that include lensing and instrumental effects .",
    "the ffp6 simulations ( cmb and noise realizations separately ) are provided at each planck frequency .",
    "we generate local variance maps from which we obtain local variance dipole distributions following the method briefly introduced in the previous section ( described in more detail in @xcite ) .",
    "since the ffp6 simulations for cmb and noise processed through the component separation procedure are not yet publicly available , we will generate foreground cleaned cmb channel maps at two frequencies 143 ghz and 217 ghz using the sevem method @xcite .",
    "we use the same four template maps as the planck collaboration ; these are difference maps of two near frequency channels : ( 30 - 44 ) ghz , ( 44 - 70 ) ghz , ( 545 - 353 ) ghz and ( 857 - 545 ) ghz . before generating the four templates , we smooth the larger frequency channel map to the resolution of the smaller frequency channel map : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the beam transfer function for the given frequency channel map",
    ". see appendix c of @xcite for details of this method .",
    "to summarize : the cleaned 143 ghz or 217 ghz map @xmath23 , is obtained by subtracting from the uncleaned channel map @xmath24 , a linear combination of the templates @xmath25 : @xmath26    the coefficients @xmath27 s are obtained by minimizing the variance of @xmath23 outside of the mask used for our analysis . once the linear coefficients for the four template maps are obtained , we use the same coefficients to process combinations of noise ffp6 simulations in order to generate noise maps for our foreground cleaned simulated maps .",
    "we process the planck maps and the simulated maps identically in each step .",
    "in addition to the isotropic local variance maps ( obtained from isotropic realizations of cmb plus noise ) , we obtain two new sets of simulated local variance maps from two other models which are obtained from the isotropic realizations as explained below :    * doppler model * : the expected dipolar temperature modulation from the doppler effect , with an amplitude @xmath28 along the direction @xmath29 @xcite . we take @xmath30 for the 143 ghz map and @xmath31 for the 217 ghz map @xcite .",
    "the dipolar modulation is generated in pixel space simply as : @xmath32 { \\left.{\\frac{\\delta t}{t}}\\right\\vert}_{\\rm iso } ( \\hat{n } )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    s generated by our modulation model that modulates large scales ( 1.25@xmath33 smoothing ) with an amplitude @xmath34 in real space , in addition to the dipolar modulation at all scales due to the cmb doppler effect .",
    "this plot was generated using 1000 simulations for the 217 ghz channel . ]    * modulation model *    : the doppler model as described above plus a large angle modulation , corresponding to a modulation at smoothing @xmath35 , along the direction ` ( l , b)=(218^\\circ , -20^\\circ ) ` , with an amplitude @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the map obtained is : @xmath36 in which the modulation is only applied to the doppler model after smoothing at @xmath35 .",
    "here we have used the notation @xmath37 for the amplitude of modulation for temperature fluctuations in the above equation to distinguish it from the dipole modulation amplitude in local variance maps @xmath10 .",
    "our choice of the smoothing scale @xmath35 is guided by our attempt to fit the obtained local variance asymmetry in data for different @xmath7 that we have considered .",
    "for example , we find that a larger @xmath38 modulation does not reproduce the local variance asymmetry in data for @xmath14 or smaller .",
    "similarly , using a smaller fwhm produces local variance asymmetry distributions with amplitudes too large to be consistent within @xmath39 with that seen in data for some disk radii ( @xmath40 , for example ) .",
    "note that when we apply modulation at large scales in this manner , we are using a filter that will suppress modulation at scales much smaller than the smoothing fwhm specified .",
    "therefore , by construction , the modulation is only generated at large scales . in figure",
    "[ fig : modulation ] , we plot the asymmetry generated by our modulation model in harmonic space ( up to @xmath0 ) ; the quantity plotted is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is taken to be the hemisphere centered at @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the @xmath45s for the relevant hemisphere is computed by masking the rest of the sky .",
    "[ [ masks ] ] masks : + + + + + +    for each map , we use the union mask u73 from the planck collaboration .",
    "this is the union of the qualitative masks for the four different component separation techniques employed by the planck collaboration , and leaves approximately 73 percent of sky unmasked .",
    "the template fitting in our sevem - like cleaning procedure is also done in the region outside this mask .",
    "the resulting clean maps at 143 ghz and 217 ghz ( with the u73 mask ) are shown in figure [ fig : cleanmaps ] .",
    "first , let us comment that we get results consistent with @xcite for @xmath46 to @xmath47 , in terms of the significance of the magnitude , and the direction of the anomalous dipole .",
    "also , our modified set of simulations that includes temperature modulation at large angular scales produces dipole distributions consistent with data .",
    "all our results presented in this paper were analyzed using the foreground cleaned 217 ghz maps unless otherwise stated . for large scale results i.e. relating to the anomalous dipole",
    ", we get similar results using the 143 ghz maps .      for @xmath48 ,",
    "our results in figure [ fig : onetwodegrees ] indicate that the effect of the doppler dipole is increasing compared to larger disk radii .",
    "further , the results also show that the modulation model that we have chosen ( modulated at large scales corresponding to a smoothing of @xmath35 , with an amplitude @xmath34 ) is consistent with data , while the no modulation ( isotropic ) model is disfavored at approximately @xmath49 .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath10 is not exactly gaussian , but we assume the distribution to be gaussian to obtain standard deviation significance values as rough guides .",
    "next , we extend the analysis to apply to even smaller disk radii",
    ".          we will now consider disks of radii @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this requires that we increase the number of disks to cover the whole sky .",
    "we therefore use disks centered on pixels of a healpix map of @xmath52 ( 786432 disks ) .",
    "figure [ fig : subdegrees ] shows our results for these two disk sizes . from the figures , it is clear that for these disk radii , the effect of the doppler dipole can not be neglected when computing the significance of the dipole amplitude obtained in the data .",
    "if we do not include the doppler effect , then the local variance dipole in the planck map is anomalous at approximately @xmath53 for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , whereas with respect to the doppler model distribution the significance drops to about @xmath39 .",
    "also , the direction of the dipole detected from planck maps gets closer to the doppler dipole as the disk radius is decreased .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : dirs ] .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ fig : subdegrees ] , the effect is still small and the distributions of the isotropic simulations and the doppler model simulations overlap quite a bit .",
    "we will now investigate if , by removing large scale features from the temperature fluctuation maps , it is possible to separate the doppler modulated local variance dipole distribution from the isotropic one , and therefore measure the doppler dipole in the planck maps .",
    "we remove large scale features by simply filtering a map using a high-@xmath20 filter i.e. set the low-@xmath20 @xmath54 values to zero in multipole space .",
    "since we are looking for an expected signal that is a vector ( i.e. to test the significance of the measurement we need to look at both the direction and magnitude of the dipole signals ) , we will determine the distribution of the component of the dipoles obtained in the direction of the known cmb dipole .",
    "this was also the approach taken by the planck collaboration @xcite ; the quantity whose distribution they plot , called @xmath55 , is the component of their estimator in the cmb dipole direction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : doppler18 ] , we show results for our local variance analysis using disk radius @xmath56 but using cmb temperature maps with @xmath57 for @xmath58 i.e. large scale features removed up to @xmath0 .",
    "the signal in the direction parallel to the cmb dipole is consistent with the doppler model distribution while the isotropic model is disfavored at @xmath59 .",
    "when using a larger disk radius @xmath60 ( also shown in figure [ fig : doppler18 ] ) , we measure the doppler dipole signal at approximately @xmath61 .",
    "we have repeated this analysis using other disk radii , different @xmath62 and the 143 ghz channel map .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : dopplerresults ] .",
    "unexpectedly , we obtain higher values of amplitude for the 143 ghz channel but in most cases the dipole amplitude in the direction of cmb dipole is within @xmath39 of the expected distribution obtained from the doppler model . the only exception being the case of @xmath63 , 143 ghz , @xmath56 in which the signal in data is at @xmath64 from the doppler model distribution . in all cases , no amplitude in excess of @xmath39",
    "is obtained in two directions orthogonal to the cmb dipole and with each other ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    ".summary of the doppler dipole detection results .",
    "the significance of detection is computed with respect to the corresponding isotropic distribution for local variance amplitudes ( 1000 simulations ) in the cmb dipole direction . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the local variance dipole directions obtained for various cases are shown in figure [ fig : dirs ] .",
    "we can also investigate the presence of power asymmetry at small scales in the direction @xmath65 , in our small scale maps that have @xmath54 s up to @xmath0 set to zero .",
    "a similar study of the power asymmetry at small scales ( but in multipole space ) was performed in @xcite using foreground cleaned smica maps ; they report no such small scale asymmetry after accounting for a number of effects , including estimates of power asymmetry due to the doppler effect .",
    "they report an upper bound on the modulation amplitude of @xmath66 at these scales .",
    "another important previous work on constraining hemispherical power asymmetry at smaller scales is @xcite using quasars that reports @xmath67 at @xmath68 .    when repeating our measurements shown in figure [ fig : doppler18 ] , but now in the direction @xmath65 , we find that the local variance dipole amplitude component in the data is within @xmath69 expectation from both isotropic and doppler model distributions .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : smallscale ] .",
    "each value in the doppler model distribution is basically shifted right from the isotropic distribution ( see the inset in figure [ fig : smallscale ] ) ; this shift is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the direction of large scale asymmetry and the direction of the cmb doppler dipole .",
    "therefore , we subtract this shift to get the value of the intrinsic local variance power asymmetry . using @xmath56 ,",
    "we obtain ( at @xmath39 ) : @xmath70        however , we can see from our results for the doppler model distributions that the relation between @xmath37 of a dipole modulated model and the most likely value of @xmath10 obtained from the corresponding local variance maps is not quite simple .",
    "this can be directly seen in figure [ fig : doppler18 ] in which the doppler model had @xmath71 whereas the obtained distributions for @xmath10 are different for the two cases with different @xmath7 . to estimate the @xmath37 constraint from the @xmath10 constraint in eqn [ eqn : smallconstraint ] , let us assume that the relationship between them is linear for small values of @xmath37 up to approximately @xmath72 ( for a given frequency channel , @xmath7 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "then , for the case of the 217 ghz channel maps , @xmath56 and @xmath73 , we can use the correspondence between @xmath37 and @xmath10 of the distributions from simulations in figure [ fig : doppler18 ] , and translate the constraint in eqn [ eqn : smallconstraint ] to ( at @xmath39 ) : @xmath74 to further check our translation between @xmath10 and @xmath37 , we repeated this small scale analysis with a @xmath75 modulation model and recovered the intrinsic local variance dipole amplitude obtained in eqn [ eqn : smallconstraint ] . using other larger values of @xmath7 or the 143 ghz channel map ,",
    "we obtained slightly weaker but consistent constraints for the small scale power asymmetry @xmath37 in the direction of the large scale hemispherical power asymmetry .",
    "in this short work , we have used local variance maps to study the power asymmetry in planck temperature anisotropy maps , extending the work done in @xcite that used the same method to smaller scales .",
    "we have shown that the effect of the doppler dipole is small for local variance dipole measurements at large disk radii ( @xmath76 ) ; we find that the peak of the doppler model distribution for the 217 ghz case is less than @xmath77 away from that of the isotropic distribution for the @xmath78 result .",
    "the difference gets even smaller for larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "further , we have also shown that the doppler dipole can be measured to a moderate significance using this method .",
    "the first measurement of the doppler signal in the temperature fluctuations was done by the planck collaboration in @xcite .",
    "the method of local variance is a pixel space method , so our measurement is complimentary to that done by the planck team using harmonic space estimators sensitive to the correlations between different multipoles induced by the doppler effect .",
    "however , local variance dipoles are not sensitive to the aberration effect and therefore our method is less sensitive than the estimators that consider the aberration effect in addition to the dipolar power modulation .    for our large scale asymmetry analysis",
    ", we find similar results using both 217 ghz channel maps ( reported in figures in this paper ) and 143 ghz channel maps .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works @xcite that have investigated channel dependence of hemispherical power asymmetry in wmap maps .    throughout our analysis",
    ", we included a large scale modulation model in which temperature anisotropies were modulated only for scales smoothed ( gaussian smoothing ) at fwhm=1.25 degrees and found that the anomalous power asymmetry seen at all @xmath7 analyzed in this paper using the local variance method is consistent with this simple phenomenological model .",
    "this tells us about the scale dependence of the power asymmetry seen in data as our modulation model generates a scale dependent hemispherical asymmetry in @xmath45s ( see figure [ fig : modulation ] ) .",
    "we summarize important aspects of our work and results in the following points :    * we have verified the hemispherical power asymmetry results obtained in @xcite , with the exception of @xmath79 degrees for which we have identified the need to use more disks in order to cover the whole sky .",
    "* once we use smaller disk radii in our local variance analysis , the effect of the dipolar doppler modulation becomes increasingly important which can be directly observed from our dipole amplitude distributions .",
    "* after removing large scale features up to @xmath80 , we could detect the expected dipolar doppler modulation in planck temperature anisotropy maps at a significance of approximately @xmath81 .",
    "* we have obtained a constraint on dipolar modulation amplitude at small scales ( @xmath82 ) in the direction of the large scale anomalous hemispherical power asymmetry as @xmath83 .",
    "we expect this work to be useful for a better understanding of the power asymmetries that are known to exist in the cmb data .",
    "in particular , we hope that our work will shed more light on local variance statistics in cmb maps which is already being used to compare theoretical models of power asymmetry with data @xcite .",
    "while a satisfying theoretical explanation for the power asymmetry anomaly still lacks in the literature , several interesting proposals exist @xcite .",
    "the statistical fluke hypothesis still remains a possibility too @xcite .",
    "more careful studies of both data and theoretical possibilities are important since the implications of progress in any direction consists of learning more about the fundamental statistical assumptions that we make about the universe at large scales .",
