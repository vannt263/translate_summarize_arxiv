    "in this work , we give a  rigorous analysis of the behavior of stochastic burgers equations in one spatial dimension under various approximation schemes .",
    "it was recently argued in @xcite that if the approximation scheme fails to satisfy a  certain symmetry condition , then one expects the approximations to converge to a  modified equation , with the appearance of an additional correction term in the limit .",
    "this correction term is somewhat similar to the it ",
    "stratonovich correction that appears in the study of sdes when one compares centred and one - sided approximations .",
    "the present article provides a  rigorous justification of the results observed in @xcite , at least in the case where the nonlinearity of the equation is of gradient type , and therefore the limiting equation is well posed in a  classical sense .",
    "more precisely , we will consider in this work stochastic pdes of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an @xmath3-valued function , with @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath6 is a  positive constant , the functions @xmath7 are assumed to be @xmath8 , and the stochastic forcing term @xmath9 consists of independent space ",
    "time white noises in each component of @xmath3 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we endow this equation with periodic boundary conditions , but we do not expect this to alter our results significantly .    endowed with an initial condition @xmath10;{\\mathbf{r}}^n)$ ] , ( [ espde ] ) is locally well posed @xcite , provided that we rewrite the nonlinearity as @xmath11 and consider solutions either in the weak or the mild form @xcite .",
    "( note that our noise term is _ not _ the gradient of space  time white noise , as in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our solutions are actually @xmath12-hlder continuous functions for all @xmath13 . )",
    "the aim of this article is to show that this well - posedness is much less stable than one may imagine at first . indeed , if we set @xmath14 and consider the family @xmath15 of solutions to the approximate equation @xmath16 then our main result , theorem  [ thmmain - one ] below , implies that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the solution to ( [ espde ] ) , but with @xmath19 replaced by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the usual laplacian on @xmath3 .",
    "the correction term in ( [ ecorf ] ) is reminiscent of the wong  zakai correction @xcite , which arises if the driving brownian motion in a  stochastic ode or pde is approximated by stochastic processes of bounded variation .",
    "this correction term is due to the _ temporal _ roughness of the driving brownian motion and does not appear if the noise is additive .",
    "our correction term is a  consequence of the _ spatial _ roughness of the solutions and appears even though we consider spdes with additive noise . in fact , an explicit calculation allows to check that the local quadratic variation ( in space ) of the solution @xmath22 to ( [ espde ] ) is precisely given by @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , one can interpret the correction term appearing in ( [ ecorf ] ) as precisely being equal to @xmath24 times the quadratic covariation between @xmath22 and @xmath25 . recall that this is exactly the correction term that appears when one switches between it and stratonovich integral in the usual setting of stochastic  calculus .",
    "see also @xcite for a  heuristic argument for computing the correction  term .",
    "this correction term is a  purely stochastic effect and is completely unrelated to the fact that our discretization scheme is not an upwind scheme ( see @xcite ) . in the absence of noise",
    ", we would still have the regularizing property from the nonvanishing viscosity , so that pretty much any `` reasonable '' numerical scheme would converge to the correct solution .",
    "if @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath27 , defined by @xmath28 , then a  similar result is true , but the sign in front of the correction term in ( [ ecorf ] ) changes .",
    "we will actually consider a  much more general class of approximations to ( [ espde ] ) , where we also allow both the linear operator @xmath29 and the noise term @xmath9 to be replaced by approximate versions that are still translation - invariant , but modified at the lengthscale @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath31 , we consider approximating stochastic pdes of the type @xmath32 since our system is invariant under spatial translations , it seems natural to restrict ourselves to a  class of approximations that enjoys the same property . throughout this article",
    ", we will therefore use approximate differential operators @xmath33 and  @xmath34 , as well as an approximate space ",

    "there exists a  signed borel measure @xmath48 such that @xmath49 and such that @xmath50 in particular , we have @xmath51 .    the function @xmath52 is bounded and such that @xmath53 is of bounded variation .",

    ", we assume that @xmath77 is odd and we set @xmath78 we furthermore identify a  function @xmath22 with the trigonometric polynomial of degree @xmath79 agreeing with @xmath22 at the gridpoints .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath80 the natural choice for the discretization of the derivative operator in this case is to choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be integers , so that discretization takes place on the gridpoints . with this choice",
    ", it can be shown that the correction factor is identical to that obtained in the previous case .",
    "note however that this is _ not _ the case if the discretization of the derivative operator is not adapted to the gridsize .      in this case , we approximate @xmath21 and @xmath9 by only keeping those fourier modes that appear in the approximation by trigonometric polynomials .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath83 the correction factor @xmath59 is then given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ secproof ] ,",
    "we introduce notation , we give a  refined formulation of the main result and present an outline of the proof of the main result ( theorem  [ thmmain ] ) . in section  [ secingredients ] , we prove several useful bounds on the approximating semigroups and the approximations of the gradient .",
    "section  [ secprobtools ] is devoted to several estimates for stochastic convolutions , the most crucial one being proposition  [ propsecond - chaos ] , which is responsible for the correction term appearing in the limiting equation .",
    "most of the work is performed in section [ secapprox ] , where convergence of various approximating equations is proved .",

    "in the rest of the paper we write @xmath127 to denote the norm of an element @xmath22 in the fractional sobolev space @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",

    "however , we do not believe that any rate obtained in this way would reflect the true speed of convergence , so we keep with the values ( [ eexponents ] ) that yield simple fractions .    from a  technical point of view",
    ", the general methodology followed in this section and the subsequent sections is inspired from  @xcite , where a  somewhat similar phenomenon was investigated . besides the structural differences in the equations considered here and in @xcite , the main technical difficulties that need to be overcome for the present work are the following :    in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to simply subtract the stochastic convolution @xmath141 ( or  @xmath142 ) and work with the equation for the remainder .",
    "here , we instead subtract only the highest fourier modes of @xmath141 .",
    "the reason for this choice is that it entails that @xmath143 as @xmath144 .",
    "this allows us to linearize the nonlinearity around @xmath145 in order to exhibit the desired correction term . as a  consequence ,",
    "our a priori regularity estimates are much worse than those in @xcite and our convergence rates are worse .",
    "the main reason why we need this complication is that our approximate derivative @xmath34 does not satisfy the chain rule .",
    "all of our fixpoint arguments need to be performed in the fractional sobolev space @xmath118 , for some @xmath146 .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite where some of the arguments could be performed first in @xmath62 , and then lifted to @xmath118 by a  standard bootstrapping argument .",
    "these bootstrapping arguments fail here , since the nonlinearity of our approximating equation contains an approximate derivative , which gives rise to correction terms which are not easy to control .    in one crucial step where a  gaussian concentration inequality is employed in @xcite , it was necessary that the stochastic convolutions belong to  @xmath118 for some @xmath147",
    "this is the case in @xcite as a  consequence of the extra regularizing effect caused by a  small fourth - order term present in the linear part .",
    "this additional regularizing effect is not always present in the current work .",
    "we therefore perform another truncation in fourier space , at very high frequencies .",
    "this is the purpose of the exponent @xmath140 .",
    "note also that proposition  [ propsecond - chaos ] is the analogue of proposition 4.1 in @xcite .",
    "one difference is that we have a  much cleaner separation of the probabilistic and the analytical aspects of this result .    by a  standard picard fixed point argument ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) it can be shown that ( [ equ-0 ] ) admits a  unique mild solution @xmath18 defined on a  random time interval @xmath148 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the spatial regularity of @xmath96 and @xmath18 equals that of a  brownian path , in the sense that @xmath149 and @xmath150 are continuous and belong to @xmath128 for any @xmath151 and any @xmath152 , but not to @xmath153 .",

    "in fact , @xmath155 almost surely for any @xmath130 and any @xmath152 , but one does not expect it to belong to  @xmath156 in general .",
    "this follows immediately from the mild formulation  ( [ equ-0 ] ) combined with a  standard bootstrapping argument .",
    "it follows from these considerations that , for every fixed time horizon  @xmath157 , the stopping time @xmath158 converges in probability to @xmath159 as @xmath160 .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ secprobtools ] that a  number of functionals of @xmath96 and @xmath97 scale in the following way : @xmath161 where the quantities @xmath162 and @xmath163 are defined by @xmath164 note that all of these relations are of the form @xmath165 for some expression @xmath166 depending on @xmath30 and some exponent @xmath167 . in the proof",
    ", it will be convenient to impose this behavior by means of a  hard constraint .",
