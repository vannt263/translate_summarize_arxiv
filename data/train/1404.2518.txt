    "<S> different methods to extract the temperature and density in heavy ion collisions are compared using a statistical model tailored to reproduce many experimental features at low excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> the model assumes a sequential decay of an excited nucleus and a fermi gas entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we first generate statistical events as function of excitation energy but stopping the decay chain at the first step . </S>",
    "<S> in such a condition the ` exact ' model temperature is determined from the fermi gas relation to the excitation energy . from these events , using quantum and classical fluctuation methods for protons and neutrons , we derive temperature and density ( quantum case only ) of the system under consideration . additionally , the same quantities are also extracted using the double ratio method for different particle combinations . a very good agreement between the `` exact '' temperatures and quantum fluctuation temperatures </S>",
    "<S> is obtained , the role of the density is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> classical methods give a reasonable estimate of the temperature when the density is very low as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of secondary decays of the excited fragments are discussed as well .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2#3#4#1 * # 2 * , # 3 ( # 4 ) .    the nuclear equation of state ( neos ) is one of the most challenging open problems today in particular the access to the symmetry energy part which carries relevant information especially for the nuclear ( astro)physics domain@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a feasible way to experimentally constrain the neos is through the use of heavy ion collisions ( hic ) at intermediate energies involving nuclei with a large range of n / a concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the systems created in such conditions are dynamical and strongly influenced by coulomb , angular momentum and other effects , thus the determination of ` quasi - equilibrium ' conditions is rather challenging . </S>",
    "<S> the neos can be determined if we are able to extract the temperature , density and pressure , or free energy from the hic data . </S>",
    "<S> several methods can be found in the literature to determine such quantities from available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> classical approaches include slope temperature from the kinetic energy distribution of emitted ions @xcite , excited level energy distributions @xcite and double isotopic ratios @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the last method provides information on the density @xmath0 of the system at the time when fragments are emitted from a source at a given excitation energy per particle @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a coalescence approach @xcite can also be used to estimate the density of the system . even though such a method is derived from classical physics , </S>",
    "<S> the obtained densities are higher than that of the double ratio method @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this might be due to the introduction of a new parameter ( the coalescence radius @xmath2 ) which is determined from experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> such a parameter might in fact mimic important quantum effects @xcite which result in a generally higher density , for a given temperature @xmath3 , as compared to the one obtained from the double ratio method . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a different method to extract @xmath3 and @xmath0 from the data has been proposed in @xcite based on fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the method was first used for quadrupole fluctuations within a classical approach , in order to obtain the temperature of the system . later on this method was applied to quantum systems for which the temperature is naturally connected to the density . in such a scenario , particle multiplicity fluctuations are used in order to pin down @xmath3 and @xmath0 from experimental data and modeling @xcite . an important first distinction between fermions and bosons is necessary in order to evidence important quantum effects such as fermion quenching ( fq ) and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a correction due to coulomb effects for bosons and fermions was also introduced in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .     are used in the left and right hand side panels . </S>",
    "<S> the exact value of @xmath3 obtained from the fermi gas relation , eq . ( [ energy ] ) , is given by the full ( red ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> available experimental data from the current literature are given by the ( blue ) dashed line @xcite and open stars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> open ( full ) circles and open ( full ) squares refer to the classical ( quantum ) fluctuation method for protons and neutrons respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the full upward triangles refer to the total density . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted lines refer to the total densities estimated from level density for different @xmath4 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leveldens ] ) . ]    in order to distinguish among different approaches and test their region of validity , we have applied the double ratio method , the classical and quantum fluctuation methods to analyze ` events ' obtained from a commonly used statistical model dubbed as gemini @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar studies using the slope temperature have been reported in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the model assumes a sequential statistical decay of a hot source of mass ( @xmath5 ) and charge ( @xmath6 ) , with @xmath1 and a given total angular momentum @xmath7 , which we assume equal to zero for simplicity in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we fix @xmath8 and @xmath9 also in order to compare to many calculations based on the constrained molecular dynamical model ( comd ) which we have performed before @xcite . the statistical model assumes that a hot source decays into a small fragment @xmath10 and a daughter nucleus @xmath11 . in general both fragments can be still excited and decay again into other fragments and so on until all excitation energy is transformed into kinetic energy of fragments and the q - value determined from the initial source and the final fragments . at each decay step </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of the process is determined from the entropy which is assumed to be that of a fermi gas @xcite : @xmath12 corresponding to an excitation energy @xmath13 both equations can be derived from a simple low temperature approximation of a fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> the level density parameter @xmath14 in such approximation is given by : @xmath15 for ground state density @xmath16 mev . in order to take into account experimental observations , the parameter @xmath4 in the model </S>",
    "<S> is adjusted to a smaller value which could depend on excitation energy as well @xcite . for our purposes </S>",
    "<S> we will use two fixed @xmath4 values of 7.3 mev and 15 mev since our goal is to test different methods to determine @xmath3 and @xmath0 from the model data . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the model , the temperature can be derived from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) if we stop the simulation after the first decay step . </S>",
    "<S> the following steps take into account a decreasing temperature due to particle emissions in previous decays , thus the @xmath3 determination becomes ` tricky ' and we will discuss it later on in the paper . </S>",
    "<S> the model does not implicitly assume any density , even though one might naively think that the density of the system is that of the excited nucleus in its ground state density . </S>",
    "<S> this is not however correct since the fermi gas relation is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the level density is connected to density by the relation : @xmath17    . </S>",
    "<S> ( top panels ) the asterisks and crosses refer to the @xmath3 obtained from dr using dth@xmath18 and pnth combinations respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( bottom panels ) open diamonds , open crosses and full downward triangles refer to p , n and total densities obtained from the dth@xmath18 dr . </S>",
    "<S> open circles , squares and upward triangles refer to the same quantities from the pnth dr . ]    </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath16 mev implies a nuclear ground state density , while @xmath19 mev results in @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that other effects can be invoked to justify the smaller value of @xmath4 , such as an effective mass or momentum dependence of the neos @xcite ; however in the simple fermi gas used in the model , the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leveldens ] ) is the natural explanation . </S>",
    "<S> this has an important consequence and in fact , we would naively expect that the different approaches to determine the density will give values compatible to the estimate above , at least asymptotically i.e. at high @xmath3 where different effects , such as coulomb barriers and q - values become less important . at low @xmath3 , these effects are important and will determine the probability of decay into a given channel rather than another . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the decay probability at low @xmath3 will effectively decrease the values of the densities obtained from all methods , which might correspond to the fact discussed in comd simulation , that the emitted particles at low @xmath3 are located in a low density region of the nuclear surface : a low @xmath3 will correspond to a lower @xmath0 .     and [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( bottom panels ) the full triangles , open triangles and asterisks refer to qf , dth@xmath18 and pnth dr respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that the model assumes a barrier penetration of particles at various excitation energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an effective radius is assumed for the system @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> for a nucleus of mass @xmath8 this gives an effective radius @xmath22 which is equivalent to a system having a density less than one third of the normal nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> of course this assumption might be in contrast with the density value obtained from the fermi gas relation . </S>",
    "<S> however our goal is not to modify the model but to use it as a test bench , keeping in mind that these assumptions might be justified at low excitation energies ( for which the model was proposed ) and not at higher ones where fragmentation will dominate .     for all steps model simulations . </S>",
    "<S> ]    using the gemini code available in the literature @xcite , we have generated one million events for each excitation energy ( or initial @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the results for the simulations stopped at the first decay step where the relation of the excitation energy and temperature is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) . in figure [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot the temperature @xmath3 ( top panels ) and the density @xmath23 ( bottom panels ) as function of the excitation energy per particle of the intial hot system . </S>",
    "<S> two different values of the @xmath4 fermi gas parameter are used in the left and right hand side panels . </S>",
    "<S> the exact value of @xmath3 obtained from the fermi gas relation , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) , is given by the full ( red ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> available experimental data from the current literature are given by the dashed ( blue ) lines @xcite and open stars @xcite , which we have reported for reference purposes only . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuation ( qf ) method , both for neutron and proton , agrees rather well with the exact result as expected since the basic assumption in the method and in the gemini model is the same , i.e. a nucleus made of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the classical fluctuation method ( cf ) agrees with the exact method especially for the neutron case and at low excitation energies for both protons and neutrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this behavior could be explained from the bottom part of figure [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the densities estimated only from the qf method ( the cf does not determine a density since the multiplicity fluctuation are equal to one classically ) are very low especially for neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that at low densities and relatively high @xmath3 , classical and quantum methods should give similar results . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show the density obtained using the double ratio method is even smaller than the one obtained from qf . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the proton density is given by full circles and the neutron density by full squares , while the total density is given by full triangle symbols . </S>",
    "<S> all densities have been normalized to their respective ground state values , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why we have extended the model to such high excitation energies where it is not necessarily justified , is because we wanted to show that the estimated total density tends asymptotically to the value estimated from the fermi gas relation , eq . ( [ leveldens ] ) , using the respective @xmath4 values which are given by the dotted horizontal lines in figure [ fig1 ] . at low excitation energies , different q - values for particle emissions and barrier penetrations </S>",
    "<S> modify the fluctuations given by the fermi gas entropy , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ entropy ] ) , which results in lower densities as displayed . </S>",
    "<S> if these effects would be turned off , then fluctuations would arise from the fermi gas entropy as for the quantum fluctuation method which is based on the same fermi gas assumption @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion above can be extended to the double ratio ( dr ) method @xcite and reported in figure [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the asterisks and crosses refer to the @xmath3 obtained from dr using deuteron , triton,@xmath27 , @xmath18 ( dth@xmath18 ) and p , n , t , @xmath27 ( pnth ) combinations , respectively . the celebrated plateau of the caloric curve is observed in figure [ fig2 ] ( top panels ) especially for the dth@xmath18 combination mostly used in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice the peculiar and maybe surprising result obtained using the pnth dr for which @xmath3 goes down for increasing excitation energy ( top panels in figure [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar opposite behavior for the two cases is obtained for the densities ( bottom panels in figure [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the pnth densities decrease for increasing excitation energy . all densities estimated from dr are much smaller than those from qf and do not asymptotically tend to the value obtained from the fermi gas relation , eq . ( [ leveldens ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course this is not surprising since we are using classical physics to estimate quantities obtained from a model based on a quantum ( fermi - gas ) system .     </S>",
    "<S> for all steps model simulations . ]    . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another way to visualize the results is by plotting density ( top panels ) and the difference of neutron and proton density ( bottom panels ) as function of @xmath3 as reported in figure [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> now the surprising differences in the densities obtained from the pnth and dth@xmath18 cases in figure [ fig2 ] are not observed : the two dr methods agree which simply tells us that the control parameter is @xmath3 and not the excitation energy as it should be in a statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> the densities differ greatly in the qf and dr methods as observed before . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ leveldens ] ) and the available data support higher densities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the qf results tend asymptotically to the value expected from the fermi gas and the used @xmath4 parameters . </S>",
    "<S> notice the large difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 densities as obtained in different approaches ( bottom panels in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular all different methods fail to reproduce the initial source value of zero @xmath30 which should be recovered at high @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is however a failure of the statistical model which we have pushed at high excitation energies where it is not justified . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that in a two - component system phase transition , the quantity plotted in the bottom part of figure [ fig3 ] , could be considered as an order parameter @xcite .    for completeness in figures </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we display the results obtained when all steps in the statistical decay model are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> these figures should be compared to figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe generally a decrease of @xmath3 and an increase of @xmath0 compared to the first step results . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that , if the general assumption of a sequential decay is correct , then the derived @xmath3 and @xmath0 estimated in the different methods are effective values influenced by the secondary decay . within the fluctuation method </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that the initial @xmath3 is somehow between the classical and the quantum cases , while the dr method fail in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we have seen in figure [ fig3 ] , plots of @xmath0 and @xmath3 as function of excitation energy might be misleading as in the pnth and dth@xmath18 cases . in figure [ fig6 ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath0 as function of @xmath3 obtained from different assumptions both at the first decay and all decay steps . </S>",
    "<S> as we see in the figure all results roughly collapse in single curves , especially results from the dr method , which suggests that indeed the values of @xmath3 might shift down due to the secondary decay , however the corresponding density is also modified in such a way to collapse in a single curve . </S>",
    "<S> this result should be compared to similar calculations using comd , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 26 ) in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in conclusion , in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have compared different proposed methods to extract density and temperature using a statistical sequential model . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the model observables are better reproduced by the quantum fluctuations method since the same physical ingredient , the fermi gas , is used . </S>",
    "<S> double ratios fail because of the classical assumptions as it should be . </S>",
    "<S> however , the feature that different ratios give different @xmath3 and @xmath0 as function of excitation energy is misleading . </S>",
    "<S> an agreement of the different particle ratios is observed when the temperature is used as a control parameter as it should be in a statistical environment . </S>",
    "<S> secondary decays support again the qf method as compared to the dr and differences might be highlighted by plotting densities as function of the control parameter @xmath3 . </S>"
