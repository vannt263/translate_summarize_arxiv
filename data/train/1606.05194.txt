    "the present theory of channeling is based on the assumption that the potential of a set of atoms forming a crystal can be replaced by the potential of a system of continuous atomic chains or planes .",
    "this approach , first proposed by lindhard [ 1 ] , can be regarded as a model approach .",
    "its quantum - mechanical version [ 2 , 3 ] predicts a number of effects associated with channeling .",
    "in particular , radiation which accompanies channeling has received considerable attention [ 4 - 6 ] . although the model approach is widely used , it is not quite satisfactory since , strictly speaking , it is not an approximate method and , therefore , it can not describe correctly finer effects which require extension beyond the average potential such as discreteness of the potential , boundary effects , interstitial atoms , vacancies , etc .",
    "the average potential in the aforementioned model approach is introduced artificially ( as the zeroth fourier component of the real potential ) and longitudinal scattering disappears in this approach .",
    "it follows that the problem of scattering from a realistic potential bounded in space can not be treated by this method .",
    "it is our aim to study elastic scattering of fast particles from the potentials of an atomic chain and an atomic plane within the general scattering theory .",
    "it will be shown quite rigorously that the average potential of an atomic chain introduced by lindhard [ 1 ] is obtained from double asymptotic expansion of the lippmann - schwinger equation in terms of the length of the atomic chain @xmath0 and in terms of the longitudinal momentum component of the incident particle @xmath1 .",
    "it is then possible to formulate a general method for calculating corrections to the zeroth approximation corresponding to the average potential since such corrections are simply the next higher - order terms in the asymptotic expansion in terms of large parameters in the problem . in the case of an atomic plane ,",
    "it is necessary to carry out an asymptotic expansion of higher multiplicity .",
    "the zeroth - order wave function is expressed in the present approach in terms of a transverse integral equation with a kernel depending on the longitudinal length of an atomic chain or an atomic plane .",
    "an analysis of this equation indicates that the density of the wave function for negatively charged particles depends logarithmically on the length of the atomic chain near the maximum and can be much greater than unity . for real single crystals",
    ", this effect is known as flux peaking effect[7 ] .",
    "we shall consider scattering of fast charged particles from the potential of an atomic chain containing @xmath2 atoms separated by the lattice period @xmath3 . to ensure that the opposite ends of the chain tend uniformly to @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 , we shall choose the origin at @xmath7 .",
    "the fourier transform of the potential then remains the same for even and odd @xmath2 , and we shall quote the potential for an odd number of atoms    @xmath8    without loss of generality , we shall consider the scattering of nonrelativistic particles whose wave function satisfies the lippmann -schwinger equation ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the particle mass .",
    "it is well known that the solution of the integral equation ( 3 ) can be written formally as an infinite born series @xmath13 with terms @xmath14 , @xmath15 an eikonal expression for the wave function is obtained from the expansion of @xmath16 in powers of @xmath17 followed by summation of the first terms of this expansion [ 8 ] .",
    "an additional expansion in powers of @xmath0 was considered in [ 9 ] within the eikonal approximation , i.e. , a double asymptotic expansion has been used ( first expansion in powers of @xmath17 and then in powers of @xmath0 ) . however , the eikonal approximation is not uniform with respect to the length of the potential and holds for @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that an expansion where the limit @xmath0 is taken first and then the limit @xmath17 should yield a different result .",
    "in fact , the pole of the green function ( in the momentum space shifted by an amount equal to the particle momentum p ) @xmath19 i.e. , the point @xmath20 merges in the limit @xmath17 with a removable singularity of the component @xmath21 of the fourier potential of the chain defined by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the resulting nonuniform behavior in the asymptotic expansion of the integrals involved is due to merging of certain critical singularities [ 10 , 11 ] . to obtain the wave function in the field of a chain with @xmath22 ,",
    "it is necessary to derive an asymptotic expansion of @xmath23 which is uniform over the length of the chain @xmath24 .",
    "the parabolic approximation of leontovich and fock [ 12 ] represents such expansion . for @xmath25",
    ", the parabolic approximation can be simplified . the simplification in question",
    "can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( 5 ) by expanding with respect to @xmath26 and then with respect to @xmath1 , and the results are quoted below . omitting the intermediate steps ,",
    "we can write the principal term for @xmath27 in the form @xmath28   e^{- i{\\bf p_{\\perp } r_{1 \\perp } } }   v_{\\perp}({\\bf r_{\\perp } -r_{1 \\perp } } ,   0 ) , \\label{r6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 is a hankel function of first kind ; @xmath30 is an incomplete hankel cylindrical function [ 13 ] .",

    "since the integrand in eq.(6 ) is independent of @xmath32 , we can introduce quite consistently in eq .",
