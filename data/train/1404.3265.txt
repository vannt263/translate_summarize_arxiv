    "the number of wireless devices has skyrocketed over the last decade , which exasperates the scarcity of spectral resources .",
    "the reality is that most wireless spectrum bands have been allocated by regulatory agencies to licensed users , which however are severely under - utilized .",
    "it is reported that the utilization of licensed spectrum varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1  @xcite , and only @xmath2 of the spectrum from @xmath3 mhz to @xmath3 ghz is used in the us  @xcite .",
    "recently some regulators have issued permissions for unlicensed devices to use parts of the licensed spectrum under restrictions . cognitive radio",
    "( cr ) realizes the unlicensed devices ( called _ secondary users _ ) to utilize the temporarily unused licensed spectrums without interfering with the licensed devices ( called _ primary users _ ) .",
    "therefore , cr is a promising technology to alleviate the spectrum shortage problem in wireless communication , and cognitive radio network ( crn ) is considered the next generation of communication networks .    in a crn , through spectrum sensing  @xcite , each secondary user ( su ) has the ability to detect current open ( or available ) channels at its site , i.e. , channels that are not occupied by the primary users ( pus ) . due to dynamic come and go of pus , the available channels to sus have the following important characteristics : 1 ) _ spatial variation _ :",
    "sus at different locations may have different available channels ; and 2)_temporal variation _ :",
    "the available channels of a su may change over time .",
    "spectrum assignment is to allocate available channels to sus to improve network performance , such as connectivity , spectrum utilization , network throughput and fairness  @xcite .",
    "spectrum assignment is one of the most challenging problems in crns .",
    "one fundamental action in spectrum assignment is referred to as the _ rendezvous _ problem of which the simplest form can be stated as :    _ for two secondary users , alice and bob , how do they establish a connection through choosing a common channel at the same time slot ? _",
    "we call the approach they adopt for choosing a channel at each round as _ a rendezvous strategy_. a strategy attaining a fast time - to - rendezvous ( ttr ) is not trivial due to the following facts : 1 ) the local available channels for alice and bob are asymmetric ; 2 ) in a distributed system , one su only knows his / her local channel status but not the other s ; 3 ) the local channel availability may change during the rendezvous ; and 4 ) in asynchronous systems , rendezvous is even more complicated as one does not know the time of the other su or how many tries the other su has made .        in the basic form of the rendezvous problem ( also called the telephone coordination game @xcite ) , two players are placed in two separated rooms each with @xmath4 telephone lines .",
    "there is a one - to - one matching between the lines in two rooms , and players can only use matched lines to contact each other ; the matching is not known to either of the players . in every round each player can select a line in his room and see whether it is connected with the line chosen by another player .",
    "the goal is to design a strategy for the players to get connected while minimizing the number of trial rounds .",
    "it is not hard to see that the optimal strategy takes @xmath5 rounds in expectation , which is achievable by letting the first player choose a random line and keep using it , and letting the second player try the lines one by one in a random order .",
    "however , this strategy only works when the players can correctly determine who is the first player , which may not be possible in a given application .",
    "thus , a player - independent strategy is desired .",
    "anderson and weber @xcite presented such a strategy using at most @xmath6 rounds in expectation , where each player will repeat either to keep on choosing one line or randomly choosing a line different from his last choice with some probabilities .",
    "there are many other well - studied variants of the rendezvous problem ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . also , some researcher considered jammers in rendezvous , such as the node discovery in ( conventional ) multiple - channel wireless communications  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the basic version , rendezvous in crns happens in an asymmetric dynamic scenario , where each user may have different and time - variant sets of available channels .",
    "there have been a number of rendezvous strategies proposed for crns .",
    "one group of these strategies makes use of a dedicated channel , called a common control channel ( ccc ) , to exchange information between users for rendezvous ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , assuming a ccc might not be practical as the channel could be occupied by some pus , and it also introduces an easy attack point . _ blind rendezvous _ without any centralized controller or a dedicated ccc is therefore preferred ( in this paper , unless specified otherwise , rendezvous stands for this blind case ) .",
    "a main group of these rendezvous strategies adopts the channel - hopping ( ch ) technique , where sus hop among their available channels based on a hopping sequence to achieve rendezvous ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "quorum systems are also frequently adopted for rendezvous in crns(e.g .",
    ",  @xcite ) . besides",
    ", essential details of their strategy will be covered in section  [ sec : stable : azar ] .",
    "although most of the above work have considered the spatial variation of the channels , i.e. , users in different locations may have different sets of available channels , they are limited to stable ( channel ) environments where the channel availabilities are static over time .",
    "not many of them take the temporal variation of channels into account . in this work",
    ", we will study both the stable and the dynamic environment in asynchronous and synchronous systems .",
    "we hope this work may inspire further research on the dynamic version of the rendezvous problem .      in this paper",
    ", we investigate the rendezvous problem for two sus and derive optimal strategies for different system settings . for the sake of theoretical analysis , we assume each channel of alice and bob has an available probability of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , and denote the total number of channels as @xmath4 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * for a synchronous stable environment , we derive a time - adaptive strategy that guarantees successful rendezvous at the first common channel , say channel @xmath9 , within at most @xmath9 rounds .",
    "the expected ttr of our strategy is @xmath10 when @xmath11 , which is a 2-approximation to the optimal .",
    "* our main effort is devoted to the dynamic environments which better reflect the nature of temporal variation of channel availability in crns .",
    "we first define two special cases , the semi - stable and the independent dynamic cases ( refer to section  [ sec : dynamic ] ) . for the synchronous semi - stable case",
    ", we derive an optimal strategy based on the one used in the synchronous stable environment . for the independent dynamic environment",
    ", we derive a simple stationary strategy and prove that it is exactly optimal no matter whether there is a common clock or not .",
    "when @xmath11 , its expected ttr is @xmath12",
    ". then , we model the channel availability in the general dynamic environment as a markov process .",
    "when neither of the environments of two sus is stable nor semi - stable , we prove the expected ttr of our strategy is @xmath13 , which is asymptotically optimal . * based on simulation , we validate the above theoretical analysis and demonstrate the efficiency of our strategies when there are a small number of channels .",
    "besides , we reveal the impacts of different parameters on the ttr , such as the number of channels , the channel open possibilities , the extent to which the environment being dynamic , and the existence of an intruder .",
    "* paper organization : * in section  [ sec : def ] , we formally define our model and problems studied in this paper .",
    "we investigate the rendezvous problem in stable environments in section  [ sec : stable ] .",
    "the different cases in dynamic environments are studied in sections  [ sec : dynamic ] .",
    "section  [ sec : sim ] gives the simulation results and discussions .",
    "the whole paper is concluded in section  [ sec : con ] with possible future works .",
    "we consider a pair of secondary nodes , called alice and bob , which need to establish a connection .",
    "there are totally @xmath4 channels with i d s from @xmath14 to @xmath4 .",
    "a binary vector @xmath15 indicates whether a channel is open for alice at time @xmath16 , e.g. , if channel @xmath17 is open , @xmath18 ; otherwise , @xmath19 .",
    "vector @xmath20 is similarly defined for bob . through spectrum sensing , both alice and bob can know their local available channels . however , as in a distributed system , alice and bob are oblivious of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "in addition , there is no information ( i.e. , the node ids ) to break the symmetry of the two nodes .",
    "we investigate both _",
    "synchronous _ and _ asynchronous _ distributed systems in _",
    "stable _ and _ dynamic _ environments . in a synchronous system",
    ", alice and bob will have a common clock , as mentioned before , in a stable environment , the channel availability will be static over time , while in a dynamic environment , the channel status may change over time .",
    "we assume at least one common channel exists in the channel environment , or otherwise the rendezvous can never happen . within a round ( time slot ) , each node will try to achieve rendezvous once using a strategy which is stationary or adaptive over the rounds .",
    ".definitions of the symbols [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     they also claimed , which holds for any strategies in the stable environments .",
    "the proof is trivial .",
    "alice is oblivious of bob s channel status .",
    "no matter what strategy she uses , at a round , when alice chooses a channel @xmath17 , the possibility that channel @xmath17 is open at bob is @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , on the side of alice , the rendezvous possibility at a round is no more than @xmath8 .",
    "a similar result holds for bob .",
    "then , at each round , the rendezvous probability can not exceed @xmath22 .",
    "we first explain why the argument for the independent dynamic environment is not applicable to the general cases .",
    "take alice as an example .",
    "given that channel @xmath17 of alice is open at time @xmath16 , it will have a probability of @xmath23 to change to close at time @xmath24 .",
    "hence , the open probability of channel @xmath17 at time @xmath24 is @xmath25 , which in general may not be equal to @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , the events of a channel being open in different time slots are not independent , which makes the previous argument fail when applying to the general cases .    in order to analyze the performance of strategy c ,",
    "our idea is to find some special time slots such that , restricted on these slots alone , the environment becomes close to the independent dynamic environment for which a tight upper bound on the ttr has already been obtained .",
    "we then argue that such `` closeness '' can guarantee a similar time upper bound , which gives the desired result .",
    "we now formalize the above idea .",
    "let @xmath26 be a parameter to be specified later .",
    "we restrict strategy c on the @xmath27-th rounds for all non - negative integers @xmath28 , or equivalently , consider a new strategy @xmath29 which is identical to @xmath30 on the @xmath27-th rounds , but in other rounds both alice and bob do nothing , i.e. , not trying to connect with each other .",
    "obviously the ttr of @xmath29 is at least as large as that of strategy @xmath30 .",
    "hence , a proper upper bound on the ttr of @xmath29 will suffice for our purpose .    for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "let @xmath33 denote the probability that channel @xmath17 is open for alice at round @xmath34 given @xmath35 , i.e. , the availability of channel @xmath17 for alice at round @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 .",
    "( rigorously speaking @xmath38 is a random variable which takes value 0 or 1 .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in the following , the actual value of @xmath35 does not affect the result .",
    "thus we treat @xmath35 as a constant . )",
    "recalling that @xmath23 and @xmath39 , it is clear that for any integer @xmath40 , @xmath41 rearranging terms gives that for any @xmath40 , @xmath42 from which it follows that @xmath43 noting that @xmath44 is a constant independent of @xmath26 and that @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 therefore , for any @xmath47 , the open probability for channel @xmath17 at round @xmath48 given its status at round @xmath36 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath7 , provided that @xmath26 is sufficiently large ( which can always be guaranteed when @xmath11 ) .",
    "so the events that channel @xmath17 is open for alice at round @xmath49 , for all @xmath50 , are `` approximately '' independent from each other .",
    "more precisely , by choosing @xmath51 we can obtain from eqn  ( [ eqn : general ] ) that @xmath52 , which implies that @xmath53 .",
    "( here the constant 0.001 is just an illustration ; it can be arbitrarily small . )",
    "similar results also hold for bob .    then , in the @xmath27-th round for each @xmath47 , the probability that alice and bob both find channel @xmath17 is at least @xmath54 , which can be regarded as @xmath55 times the probability in eqn  ( [ eqn:14 ] ) with @xmath7 and @xmath8 replaced with @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively",
    ". then , by routine probability calculations similar to theorem  [ thm : perfc ] , the expected ttr is at most @xmath58 .",
    "finally note that , since only the @xmath27-th rounds are considered , the actually upper bound on the expected ttr should be @xmath26 times the previous bound . by our choice",
    "we have @xmath59 , as the environment dynamic factors are regarded as constants .",
