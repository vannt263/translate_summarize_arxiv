    "granular crystals are material systems based on the assembly of particles in one- , two- and three - dimensions inside a matrix ( or a holder ) in ordered closely packed configurations in which the grains are in contact with each other @xcite",
    ". the fundamental building blocks constituting such systems are macroscopic particles of spherical , toroidal , elliptical or cylindrical shapes @xcite , arranged in different geometries .",
    "the mechanical , and more specifically dynamic , properties of these systems are governed by the stress propagation at the contact between neighboring particles .",
    "this confers to the overall system a highly nonlinear response dictated , in the case of particles with an elliptical or spherical contact , by the discrete hertzian law of contact interaction @xcite .",
    "geometry and/or material anisotropy between particles composing the systems allows for the observation of interesting dynamic phenomena deriving from the interplay of discreteness and nonlinearity of the problem ( i.e. anomalous reflections , breathers , energy trapping and impulse fragmentation ) @xcite .",
    "these findings open up a large parameter space for new materials design with unique properties sharply departing from classical engineering systems .",
    "one of the prototypical excitations that have been found to arise in the granular chains are traveling solitary waves , which have been extensively studied both in the absence  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a number of recent developments ) , as well as in the presence  @xcite of the so - called precompression .",
    "the precompression is an external strain a priori imposed on the ends of the chain , resulting in a displacement of the particles from their equilibrium position .",
    "as has been detailed in these works , the profile of these traveling waves is fundamentally different in the former , in comparison to the latter case . without precompression , waves exist for any speed , featuring a doubly exponential ( but not genuinely compact ) decay law , while in the case with precompression , waves are purely supersonic ( i.e. , exist for speeds beyond the speed of sound in the medium ) and decay exponentially in space .",
    "in fact , the fpu type lattices such as the one arising also from the hertzian chain in the presence of precompression have been studied extensively ( see  @xcite and references cited therein for an overview of the history of the fpu model ) .",
    "it is known , both formally  @xcite and rigorously  @xcite ( on long but finite time scales ) that kdv approximates fpu @xmath0-type lattices for small - amplitude , long - wave , low - energy initial data .",
    "this fact has been used in the mathematical literature to determine the shape  @xcite and dynamical stability @xcite of solitary waves and even of their interactions  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the above referenced remarks in the mathematical literature are valid `` for @xmath1 sufficiently small '' , where @xmath1 is a parameter characterizing the amplitude and inverse width , as well as speed of the waves above the medium s sound speed .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is to determine the range of the parameter @xmath1 for which this theory can be numerically validated , an observation that , in turn , would be of considerable use to ongoing granular chain experiments .",
    "it is that general vein of connecting the non - integrable traveling solitary wave interactions of the granular chain ( that can be monitored experimentally ) with the underlying integrable ( and hence analytically tractable ) approximations , that the present work will be following . in particular ,",
    "our aim is to quantify approximations of the hertzian contact model to two other models , one continuum and one discrete in which soliton and multi - soliton solutions are analytically available .",
    "these are , respectively , the kdv equation and the toda lattice .",
    "the former possesses only uni - directional waves .",
    "since hamiltonian lattices are time - reversible , a single kdv equation can not capture the evolution of general initial data .",
    "it is typical to use a pair of uncoupled kdv equations , one moving rightward and one moving leftward to capture the evolution of general initial data  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the toda lattice has several benefits as an approximation of the granular problem .",
    "firstly , it is inherently discrete , hence it is not necessary to use a long wavelength type approximation that is relevant for the applicability of the kdv reduction  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the toda lattice admits two - way wave propagation , hence a single equation can capture the evolution of all ( small amplitude ) initial data .",
    "once these approximations are established , we will `` translate '' two - soliton solutions , as well as superpositions of 1-soliton solutions of the integrable models into initial conditions of the granular lattice and will dynamically evolve and monitor their interactions in comparison to what the analytically tractable approximations ( kdv and toda ) yield for these interactions .",
    "we will explore how the error in the approximations grows , as a function of the amplitude of the interacting waves , so as to appreciate the parametric regime where these approximations can be deemed suitable for understanding the inter - soliton interaction .",
    "we believe that such findings will be of value to theorists and experimentalists alike . on the mathematical / theoretical side , they are relevant for appreciating the limits of applicability of the theory and the sharpness of its error bounds . on the experimental side ,",
    "these explicit analytical expressions provide a yardstick for quantifying solitary wave collisions ( at least within an appropriate regime ) in connection to the well - characterized by now direct observations  .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will present the analysis and comparisons for the kdv reduction . in section iii",
    ", we will do the same for the toda lattice , examining in this case both co - propagating and counter - propagating soliton collisions .",
    "finally , in section iv , we will summarize our findings and present some conclusions , as well as some directions for future study . in the appendix",
    ", we will present some rigorous technical aspects of the approximation of the fpu solution by the toda lattice one .",
    "our starting point here will be an adimensional , rescaled form of the granular lattice problem , with precompression @xmath2  @xcite that reads : @xmath3^p_+ - [ \\delta_0+y_{n}-y_{n+1}]^p_+\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the displacement of the @xmath5-th particle from equilibrium , and @xmath6_+ = max\\{0 , x\\}$ ] . defining the strain variables as @xmath7",

    "i.e. , the analytical and numerical results share the same initial condition and their observed / measured differences are solely generated by the dynamics .",
    "it is clear that the kdv limit properly captures the individual propagation of the waves and is proximal not only qualitatively but even semi - quantitatively to the details of the inter - soliton interaction , as is illustrated from the middle and especially the bottom panels of the figure .",
    "nevertheless , there is a quantative discrepancy in tracking the positions of the solitary waves , especially so after the collision .",
    "the second figure shows a space - time plot of the very long scale of the observed time evolution .",
    "it is clear from the latter figure that small amplitude radiation ( linear ) waves are present in the actual granular chain , while such waves are absent in the kdv limit , due to its integrable , radiationless soliton dynamics .",
    "in fact , these linear radiation waves are also clearly discernible as small amplitude `` blips '' in fig .",
    "[ twosoliton ] .",
    "we believe that the very long time scales of the interaction of the waves enable numerous `` collisions '' also with these small amplitude waves thereby apparently reducing the speed of the larger waves in comparison to their kdv counterparts , as is observed in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ twosoliton ] . in that light",
    ", this is a natural consequence of the non - integrability of our physical system in comparison to the idealized kdv limit . nevertheless , we believe that the latter offers a very efficient means for monitoring the solitary wave collisions even semi - quantitatively . as a final comment on this comparison , we would like to point out that because of the very slow ( long time ) nature of the interaction , we are monitoring the dynamics in a periodic domain , merely for computational convenience .",

    "was also presented .",
    "the latter provided a high - quality description especially of counter - propagating wave collisions , while its 2-soliton solutions can also be used for capturing co - propagating cases , at least qualitatively .",
    "it is relevant to note here that at the level of @xmath109 ( i.e. , when the precompression is absent ) such collisions have _ already _ been studied in  @xcite .",
    "it thus seems that an extension of that work to experimentally consider collisions in the more theoretically and analytically tractable case of finite precompression would be possible , as much as it would be desirable .",
    "we believe that this line of thinking , and especially the approximation of using a discrete model such as the toda lattice could provide a useful tool for understanding different forms of solitary wave interactions in hertzian systems  @xcite .",
    "a more ambitious generalization would involve the consideration of two - dimensional lattices and the potential reduction thereof to kadomtsev - petviashvilli continuum models ( i.e. , 2d generalizations of the kdv ) or perhaps to other lattice models in order to understand the dynamics of higher dimensional such chains .",
    "another challenging problem would be to obtain some analytical understanding of the collisions without precompression ; the difficulty in that case stems from the absence of a well - established , yet analytically tractable ( discrete or continuum ) description for capturing multi - soliton interactions .",
    "such directions are currently under consideration and will be presented in future publications .",
    "to obtain rigorous estimates it is first useful to write the general fpu chain as a first order system .",
    "observe that the chain of oscillators @xmath110 can be rewritten as the system @xmath111 upon making the change of variables @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",

    "having provided this general setup for our toda and granular hamiltonian chains , we now proceed to present the proposition that estimates the proximity between the 2-soliton solutions of these two models for small amplitude initial data ( quantified by @xmath121 below ) and long times ( quantified by @xmath73 below ) .    let @xmath122 denote the toda hamiltonian and let @xmath123 denote its four - parameter family of two - soliton solutions .",

    "the content of the theorem is that the amount of energy that is transferred from coherent modes to radiative modes is very small compared to the energy in the coherent modes .",
    "the proposition can be regarded as a corrolary of three lemmas .",
    "before we embark into their technical description , let us give a brief outline of the physical significance of each one .",
    "lemma 3 below shows that in the context of the toda 2-soliton solution , the interaction of two broad shallow waves does not produce high ( i.e. order greater than @xmath87 ) frequency ripples i.e. , `` radiation '' corresponding to such wavenumbers .",
    "lemma 1 makes use of lemma 3 to quantify the `` local truncation error '' for the scheme given by evolving a toda 2-soliton in lieu of fpu .",
    "i.e. , when we evolve with toda 2-soliton initial conditions in our fpu ( non - integrable ) lattice instead of the integrable toda one , there is a local truncation error stemming from the difference between the two lattice dynamics .",
    "this lemma quantifies this difference as a function of the solution amplitude ( represented by @xmath121 ) .",
    "finally , lemma 2 estimates how the difference of our fpu - type lattice and the toda lattice evolves over time on the basis of the above local truncation error and how the latter `` accumulates '' over a long interval of time @xmath70 ( characterized by @xmath73 ) .",
