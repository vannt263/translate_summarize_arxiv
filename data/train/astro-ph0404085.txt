    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) mapped in radio waves are an interesting probe of large - scale structure .",
    "they can be routinely detected out to very large redshift ( @xmath6 ) over wide areas of the sky and hence delineate the largest structures and their evolution over cosmic epoch .",
    "radio emission is insensitive to dust obscuration and radio agn are effective tracers of mass : they are uniformly hosted by massive elliptical galaxies and have been shown to trace both clusters ( hill & lilly 1991 ) and superclusters ( brand et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the current generation of wide - area radio surveys such as faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first ; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al . 1998 ) contain radio galaxies in very large numbers ( @xmath7 ) and have allowed accurate measurements of the imprint of radio galaxy angular clustering .",
    "these patterns are considerably harder to detect in radio waves than in optical light due to the huge redshift range that is probed .",
    "whilst this provides access to clustering on the largest scales , it also washes out much of the angular clustering signal through the superposition of unrelated redshift slices .",
    "the angular correlation function was measured for first by cress et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and for nvss by blake & wall ( 2002a ) and overzier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the nvss radio survey , covering @xmath8 per cent of the sky , permits the measurement of fluctuations over very large angles .",
    "blake & wall ( 2002b ) detected the imprint of the cosmological velocity dipole in the nvss surface density , in a direction consistent with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) dipole . in this study",
    "we measure the angular power spectrum , @xmath0 , of the radio galaxy distribution ( baleisis et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this statistic represents the source surface - density field as a sum of sinusoidal angular density fluctuations of different wavelengths , using the spherical harmonic functions .",
    "the angular power spectrum is sensitive to large - angle fluctuations and hence complements the measurement of the angular correlation function , @xmath9 , at small angles .",
    "measurement of the @xmath0 spectrum has some advantages in comparison with @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , the error matrix describing correlations between multipoles @xmath10 has a very simple structure , becoming diagonal for a complete sky .",
    "this is not the case for the separation bins in a measurement of @xmath9 : even for a full sky , an individual galaxy appears in many separation bins , automatically inducing correlations between those bins .",
    "secondly , there is a natural relation between the angular power spectrum and the spatial power spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath11 .",
    "this latter quantity provides a very convenient means of describing structure in the universe for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly its primordial form is produced by models of inflation , which prescribe the initial pattern of density fluctuations @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , in linear theory for the growth of perturbations , fluctuations described by different wavenumbers @xmath13 evolve independently , enabling the model power spectrum to be easily scaled with redshift .",
    "the physics of linear perturbations are hence more naturally described in fourier space .",
    "in contrast , the angular correlation function is more easily related to the spatial correlation function @xmath14 , the fourier transform of @xmath11 .",
    "correlation functions more naturally serve to describe the real - space profile of collapsing structures evolving out of the linear regime .",
    "we emphasize that although the two functions @xmath0 and @xmath9 are _ theoretically _ equivalent  linked by a legendre transform  this is not true in an _ observational _ sense .",
    "for example , @xmath9 can only be successfully measured for angles up to a few degrees , but @xmath0 depends on @xmath9 at _ all _ angles .",
    "we derive the angular power spectrum using two independent methods .",
    "firstly we apply a direct spherical harmonic estimator following peebles ( 1973 ) .",
    "secondly , we use maximum likelihood estimation , commonly employed for deriving the angular power spectra of the cmb temperature and polarization maps .",
    "these two methods are described in section [ secmeth ] .",
    "we find that these two approaches yield very similar results ( section [ secres ] ) , which is unsurprising given the wide sky coverage of the nvss . in section [ secpk ] we interpret the nvss angular power spectrum in terms of the underlying spatial power spectrum of mass fluctuations and the radial distribution of radio sources .",
    "finally in section [ secbias ] we employ these models to derive the linear bias factor of nvss radio galaxies by marginalizing over the other model parameters .",
    "the 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) was performed at the very large array over the period 1993 to 1996 and covers the sky north of declination @xmath15 .",
    "the source catalogue contains @xmath16 entries and is 99 per cent complete at integrated flux density @xmath17 mjy .",
    "the full width at half - maximum of the synthesized beam is 45 arcsec ; the majority of radio sources are thus unresolved .",
    "the relatively broad nvss beam yields excellent surface brightness sensitivity and photometric completeness .    before analyzing the survey for large - scale structure we imposed various angular masks .",
    "firstly we excluded catalogue entries within @xmath18 of the galactic plane , many of which are galactic in origin ( mostly supernova remnants and hii regions ) .",
    "the contribution of foreground galactic sources at latitudes @xmath19 is negligible .",
    "we also placed 22 masks around bright local extended radio galaxies contributing large numbers of catalogue entries , as described in blake & wall ( 2002a ) .",
    "figure [ fignvss ] plots the remaining sources with @xmath20 mjy .",
    "the remaining nvss geometry corresponds to 75 per cent of the celestial sphere .",
    "blake & wall ( 2002a ) demonstrated that the nvss suffers from systematic gradients in surface density at flux - density levels at which it is complete .",
    "these gradients  corresponding to a @xmath21 per cent variation in surface density at a threshold of 3 mjy  are entirely unimportant for the vast majority of applications of this catalogue .",
    "however , they have a significant influence on the faint imprint of large - scale structure .",
    "if left uncorrected a distortion of the measured angular power spectrum would result , because the harmonic coefficients would need to reproduce the systematic gradients as well as the fluctuations due to clustering .",
    "blake & wall ( 2002a ) found that these surface gradients are only significant at fluxes @xmath22 mjy . at brighter fluxes",
    "the survey is uniform to better than 1 per cent  sufficient to allow the detection of the anticipated cosmological velocity dipole ( blake & wall 2002b ) .",
    "hence we simply restricted our @xmath0 analysis to fluxes @xmath23 mjy .",
    "the nvss source surface density at this threshold is @xmath24 deg@xmath25 .",
    "we note that the broadness of the radio luminosity function ensures that the projected clustering properties of radio galaxies are not a strong function of flux density in the range 3 mjy @xmath26 50 mjy , as verified by the correlation function analyses of blake & wall ( 2002a ) and overzier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in this flux - density range ,",
    "the redshift distribution of the radio galaxies does not change significantly .",
    "a distribution of galaxies on the sky can be generated in two statistical steps .",
    "firstly , a density field @xmath27 is created ; this may be described in terms of its spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the usual spherical harmonic functions .",
    "secondly , galaxy positions are generated in a poisson process as a ( possibly biased ) realization of this density field .",
    "the angular power spectrum @xmath0 prescribes the spherical harmonic coefficients in the first step of this model .",
    "it is defined over many realizations of the density field by @xmath31 the assumption of isotropy ensures that @xmath32 is a function of only @xmath10 , not @xmath33 .",
    "the angular power spectrum @xmath0 is theoretically equivalent to the angular correlation function @xmath9 as a description of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the two quantities are connected by the well - known relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the source surface density and @xmath36 is the legendre polynomial .",
    "however , the angular scales on which the signal - to - noise is highest are very different for each statistic .",
    "@xmath9 can only be measured accurately at small angles up to a few degrees ( blake & wall 2002a ) , beyond which poisson noise dominates .",
    "by contrast , @xmath0 for galaxies has highest signal - to - noise at small @xmath10 , corresponding to large angular scales @xmath37 . hence the two statistics are complementary , the @xmath0 spectrum probing fluctuations on the largest angular scales .",
    "peebles ( 1973 ) presented the formalism of spherical harmonic analysis of a galaxy distribution over an incomplete sky ( for refinements see e.g. wright et al .",
    "1994 ; wandelt , hivon & gorski 2000 ) . for a partial sky ,",
    "a spherical harmonic analysis is hindered by the fact that the spherical harmonics are not an orthonormal basis , which causes the measured coefficients @xmath28 to be statistically correlated , entangling different multipoles of the underlying @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "however , for the case of a survey covering @xmath38 of the sky , the repercussions ( discussed below ) are fairly negligible , implying shifts and correlations in the derived power spectrum that are far smaller than the error bars .",
    "we employed the original method of peebles ( 1973 ) with only one small correction for sample variance . in section [ secmaxlik ]",
    "we compare spherical harmonic analysis with the technique of maximum likelihood estimation and find that the two methods yield results in good agreement .",
    "the spherical harmonic coefficients of the density field may be estimated by summing over the @xmath39 galaxy positions @xmath40 : @xmath41 for an incomplete sky , these values need to be corrected for the unsurveyed regions , so that an estimate of @xmath0 is @xmath42 ( peebles 1973 equation 50 ) where @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 where the integrals are over the survey area @xmath46 , and are determined in our analysis by numerical integration .",
    "the final term in equation [ eqclpeeb ] corrects for the finite number of discrete sources : for a full sky ( @xmath47 ) we expect @xmath48 in the absence of clustering , i.e. this is the power spectrum of the shot noise",
    ". note that @xmath35 is the apparent source density @xmath49 , not the average over an imagined ensemble of catalogues .",
    "we determined the angular power spectrum for the @xmath10th multipole , @xmath50 , by averaging equation [ eqclpeeb ] over @xmath33 . because the density field is real rather than complex , @xmath51 , resulting in @xmath52 independent measurements of @xmath0 : @xmath53",
    "there is no need for us to use the modified weighting formula of peebles ( 1973 equation 53 ) . in our case",
    ", @xmath54 does not vary significantly with @xmath33 .",
    "we verified that the modified weighting formula produced indistinguishable results .",
    "one consequence of the partial sky is to `` mix '' the harmonic coefficients such that the measured angular power spectrum at @xmath10 depends on a range of @xmath55 around @xmath56 : @xmath57 the angled brackets refer to an imagined averaging over many realizations of density fields generated by @xmath0 , in accordance with equation [ eqcldef ] .",
    "peebles showed that @xmath58 ; i.e. mixing does not spuriously enhance the measured power ( this is accomplished by the factor @xmath54 in equation [ eqclpeeb ] ) .    for a complete sky , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) or 0 ( @xmath62 ) . for a partial sky ,",
    "the matrix @xmath63 can be computed from the geometry of the surveyed region ( hauser & peebles 1973 ) .",
    "figure [ figrll ] illustrates the result for the nvss for @xmath64 ( computed using hauser & peebles 1973 equation 12 ) .",
    "the nvss covers a sufficiently large fraction of the sky ( 75 per cent ) that mixing only occurs at the @xmath65 per cent level and can be neglected because the underlying @xmath0 spectrum is smooth : @xmath66 we checked the nvss @xmath63 matrix for other multipoles @xmath10 and found very similar results .",
    "this argument ensures that the measured multipoles are statistically independent to a good approximation .",
    "the statistical error on the estimator of equation [ eqclpeeb ] is @xmath67 ( peebles 1973 equation 81 ) .",
    "there are two components of the error :    * `` shot noise '' ( @xmath35 ) because the number of discrete objects is finite and therefore does not perfectly describe the underlying density field .",
    "* `` cosmic variance '' ( @xmath0 ) because even with perfect sampling of the density field , there are only a finite number of harmonics associated with the @xmath10th multipole .    the error for the @xmath68 case in equation [ eqclsig ] is greater because @xmath69 is purely real , rather than complex . in the latter case",
    ", we are averaging over the real and imaginary parts of @xmath70 , two independent estimates of @xmath0 , which reduces the overall statistical error by a factor @xmath71 . for a partial sky equation [ eqclsig ]",
    "is an approximation , because the variance of multipoles of given @xmath10 depends on the underlying power spectrum at @xmath72 . as discussed above , this effect is negligible for the nvss .",
    "the averaging over @xmath33 ( equation [ eqclobs ] ) decreases the error in the observation .",
    "combining the errors of equation [ eqclsig ] , assuming estimates at different @xmath33 are statistically independent , the resulting error in @xmath50 is @xmath73 we used monte carlo simulations to verify that equation [ eqclerr ] produced results within 5 per cent of the true error for all relevant multipoles .",
    "our only addition to the formalism of peebles ( 1973 ) was to increase the total variance on the estimate of @xmath0 by a factor @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the fraction of sky covered ( i.e. multiply equation [ eqclerr ] by @xmath76 ) .",
    "this correction factor was motivated by scott , srednicki and white ( 1994 ) as a fundamental property of sample variance for a partial sky , and is part of the standard cmb formalism ( e.g. bond , efstathiou & tegmark 1997 ) . for the nvss geometry , @xmath77 ,",
    "thus this correction corresponds to a @xmath78 per cent increase in the error .",
    "radio sources have complex morphologies and large linear sizes ( up to and exceeding 1 mpc ) . a radio - source catalogue such as",
    "the nvss will contain entries which are different components of the same galaxy ( for example , the two radio lobes of a `` classical double '' radio galaxy ) .",
    "the broad angular resolution of the nvss beam leaves over 90 per cent of radio sources unresolved ; however , the remaining multiple - component sources have a small but measurable effect on the angular power spectrum .",
    "it is relatively simple to model the effect of multiple - component sources on the estimator for @xmath0 described in section [ secestharm ] .",
    "the relevant angular scales ( @xmath79 ) are much bigger than any component separation , and equation [ eqalm ] can be replaced by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the total number of galaxies and @xmath82 is the number of components of the @xmath83th galaxy .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath84 is unchanged by the presence of multiple components ( @xmath85 denotes the average number of components per galaxy , and @xmath86 is the total number of catalogue entries , as in equation [ eqalm ] ) . but",
    "@xmath87 in equation [ eqclpeeb ] depends on @xmath88 multiple - component sources only affect the first term in this expression , producing an offset in the @xmath0 spectrum @xmath89 but @xmath90 from equation [ eqjlm ] , and this expression simplifies to an offset independent of @xmath10 : @xmath91 most multiple - component sources in the nvss catalogue are double radio sources . let a fraction @xmath92 of the radio galaxies be doubles .",
    "then @xmath93 and @xmath94 , thus the constant offset may be written @xmath95 we can deduce @xmath96 from the form of the nvss angular correlation function @xmath9 at small angles @xmath97 , where double sources dominate the close pairs ( see blake & wall 2002a and also section [ secalm ] ) .",
    "this correction was applied to the measured nvss @xmath0 spectrum and successfully removed the small systematic offset in @xmath0 at high @xmath10 .",
    "a sophisticated suite of analytical tools has been developed by the cmb community for deriving the angular power spectra of the observed cmb temperature and polarization maps .",
    "these methods can also be exploited to analyze galaxy data ( see for example efstathiou & moody 2001 , huterer , knox & nichol 2001 and tegmark et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this approach the power spectrum",
    "is determined using an iterative maximum likelihood analysis , in contrast to the direct estimator discussed in section [ secestharm ] .",
    "the likelihood is a fundamental statistical quantity , and this analysis method permits straightforward control of such issues as edge effects , noise correlations and systematic errors .    the starting point for maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) is bayes theorem @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the parameters one is trying determine , @xmath100 is the data and @xmath101 is the additional information describing the problem .",
    "the quantity @xmath102 is the likelihood , i.e. the probability of the data given a specific set of parameters , while the left - hand side is the posterior , i.e. the probability of the parameters given the data .",
    "we will assume that the sky is a realization of a stationary gaussian process , with an angular power spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "we assume no cosmological information about the distribution of the @xmath0 .",
    "the rendition of the sky will be a pixelized map , created by binning the galaxy data in equal - area cells such that the count in the @xmath83th cell is @xmath103 , effectively constructing a `` temperature map '' of galaxy surface density .",
    "we performed this task using the healpix software package ( gorksi , hivon & wandelt 1999 ; http://www.eso.org/science/healpix ) .",
    "we chose the healpix pixelization scheme @xmath104 , which corresponds to 12,288 pixels over a full sky .",
    "the angular power spectrum may be safely extracted to multipole @xmath105 .",
    "we then defined a data vector : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the mean count per pixel .",

    "the covariance matrix @xmath109 due to primordial fluctuations is given by @xmath110 where @xmath36 is the legendre polynomial and @xmath111 is the angle between pixel pair @xmath112 . in order to apply a likelihood analysis",
    "we must also specify a noise covariance matrix @xmath113 .",
    "we modelled the noise as a gaussian random process with variance @xmath114 , uncorrelated between pixels , such that @xmath115 .",

    "we used the madcap package ( borrill 1999 ; http://www.nersc.gov/@xmath118borrill/cmb/madcap ) to derive the maximum likelihood banded angular power spectrum from the pixelized galaxy map and noise matrix .",
    "madcap is a parallel implementation of the bond , jaffe & knox ( 1998 ) maximum - likelihood algorithms for the analysis of cmb datasets .",
    "we ran the analysis software on the supercomputer seaborg , administered by the national energy research scientific computing centre ( nersc ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory , california .",
    "we again applied equation [ eqcldoub ] to the madcap results to correct the measured power spectrum for the influence of multiple - component sources .",
    "boughn & crittenden ( 2002 ) also performed a healpix analysis of the nvss as part of a cross - correlation analysis with the cmb searching for evidence of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . from the pixelized map they derived an angular correlation function for the nvss , which they used to constrain theoretical models",
    "we compare their results with ours in section [ secbias ] .",
    "we tested the two methods , direct spherical harmonic and maximum likelihood estimation , by generating a dipole distribution of @xmath119 sources over the nvss geometry , where the model dipole possessed the same amplitude and direction as that detected in the nvss ( see blake & wall 2002b ) . in order to simulate multiple components , we added companion sources to @xmath120 per cent of the objects , with the same separation distribution as that measured in the nvss ( blake & wall 2002a ) .",

    "the dipole term @xmath123 is of course spuriously high , but has a negligible effect on the measured harmonics at @xmath124  the galaxy dipole ( unlike the cmb dipole ) is only barely detectable in current surveys ( blake & wall 2002b ) .",
    "the normalization convention used in figure [ figcltest ] , and the remaining power spectrum plots , is to expand the surface overdensity @xmath125 in terms of spherical harmonics . to convert from the definition of @xmath0 in equations [ eqsigylm ] and [ eqcldef ] we simply divide @xmath70 by @xmath35 ( in units of sr@xmath126 ) and hence @xmath0 by @xmath127 .",
    "figure [ figcltest ] permits a first comparison of the two independent methods of estimating @xmath0 . at low @xmath10 ,",
    "the variances are in excellent agreement .",
    "as @xmath10 approaches @xmath128 , the variance of the maximum likelihood method begins to exceed that of the spherical harmonic analysis .",
    "this occurs as the resolution of the pixelization scheme becomes important : the angular pixel size is no longer much less than the characteristic angular scale probed by the @xmath10th multipole .",
    "the variance of the high @xmath10 bins could be reduced by adopting a finer pixelization , such as @xmath129 , with the penalty of a rapidly increasing requirement of supercomputer time .",
    "given that the signal in the nvss angular power spectrum turns out to be confined to @xmath130 , our optimum pixelization remains @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , higher pixel resolution would decrease the mean pixel count @xmath107 in equation [ eqdata ] , rendering a gaussian distribution a poorer approximation for @xmath108 .",

    "alternatively , @xmath145 can be expressed in terms of the amplitude of fluctuations at the hubble radius , @xmath149 , and constrained by measurements of cmb anisotropies on large angular scales : @xmath150 for example , bunn & white ( 1997 ) give the best - fitting constraint on @xmath149 and @xmath151 for flat models ( @xmath152 ) based on results of the cobe dmr experiment : @xmath153 with a maximum @xmath154 statistical uncertainty of 7 per cent . for our fiducial cosmological parameters , a ( reasonably ) consistent cosmology is produced if @xmath155 ( i.e. @xmath156 ) .",
    "we assumed this fiducial normalization in our model , noting that the value of @xmath4 is in fact degenerate with the amplitude of a constant linear bias factor @xmath157 .",
    "equation [ eqpkmod ] is only valid ignoring non - linear effects , which will boost the value of @xmath11 on small scales as modes commence non - linear collapse .",

    "the resulting model power spectrum is shown in figure [ figpkmod ] .",
    "strictly , this modification violates the assumption of linear evolution implicit in equation [ eqdz ] .",
    "however , this is not significant in our analysis because the small scales for which non - linear evolution is important are only significant in the projection at @xmath158 .",
    "the projection of the spatial power spectrum onto the sky depends on the radial distribution of the sources under consideration , which may be deduced from their redshift distribution .",
    "we only need to know the probability distribution @xmath159 of the sources ( equation [ eqrad ] ) , the absolute normalization is not important .",
    "unfortunately , the radial distribution of mjy radio sources is not yet accurately known .",
    "the majority of radio galaxies are located at cosmological distances ( @xmath160 ) and their host galaxies are optically very faint .    however , models exist of the radio luminosity function of agn ( i.e. the co - moving space density of objects as a function of radio luminosity and redshift ) , from which the redshift distribution at any flux - density threshold can be inferred .",
    "such models have been published by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) and willott et al .",
    "these luminosity function models are by necessity constrained by relatively bright radio sources ( @xmath161 mjy ) and the extrapolation to nvss flux - density levels must be regarded as very uncertain .",
    "the willott model is constrained by a larger number of spectroscopic redshifts , and the samples of radio sources used provide fuller coverage of the luminosity - redshift plane ( thus the required extrapolation to @xmath131 mjy is less severe ) .",
    "however , the willott samples are selected at low frequency ( 151 and 178 mhz ) , necessitating a large extrapolation to the nvss observing frequency of 1.4 ghz .",
    "the dunlop & peacock models are constrained at high frequencies , but treat steep - spectrum and flat - spectrum radio sources as independent populations , which is inconsistent with current ideas concerning the unification of radio agn ( e.g. jackson & wall 1999 ) . in addition , they were computed for cosmological parameters @xmath162 , @xmath163 rather than the currently favoured `` @xmath164cdm '' cosmology .",

    "we only considered the redshift range @xmath169 in this analysis because at @xmath170 , the ( very luminous ) optical counterparts of the 10 mjy nvss sources begin slipping below the 2dfgrs magnitude threshold , which we verified by plotting the magnitudes of matched 2dfgrs galaxies against redshift .",
    "having determined the value of @xmath171 , we created the full redshift distribution by assigning the remaining probability @xmath172 over the redshift range @xmath173 in proportion to the prediction of the dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) luminosity function models .",
    "for this investigation we used the average of the seven models provided by dunlop & peacock . assuming the willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) radial distribution for @xmath173 made a negligible difference to the results ( because most of the contribution to the @xmath0 spectrum arises at low redshifts , see section [ secclpred ] ) .    matching nvss catalogue entries brighter than @xmath174 mjy with",
    "the 2dfgrs database yielded @xmath175 identifications with redshifts @xmath169 , using matching tolerance 10 arcsec ( see sadler et al .",
    "we restricted the 2dfgrs sample to `` high quality '' spectra ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "an estimate of the probability of an nvss source being located at @xmath169 is @xmath177 where @xmath178 deg@xmath25 is the surface density of nvss sources brighter than 10 mjy , and @xmath179 is the 2dfgrs area under consideration , which ( owing to the varying angular completeness ) is not trivial to calculate .",
    "we followed sadler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) by dividing the number of 2dfgrs galaxies contained in the nvss geometry by the 2dfgrs surface density @xmath180 deg@xmath25 , resulting in an effective area @xmath181 deg@xmath182 .",
    "the result , @xmath183 ( per unit redshift ) , is a significant underestimate for various reasons :    * incompletenesses in the 2dfgrs input catalogue ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "* input catalogue galaxies unable to be assigned a 2df spectrograph fibre ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "* observed 2dfgrs spectra with insufficient quality ( @xmath186 ) to determine a redshift ( @xmath187 ) . *",
    "extended radio sources with catalogue entries located more than 10 arcsec from the optical counterpart ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the estimated correction factors in brackets were obtained from colless et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and from carole jackson ( priv . comm . ) .",
    "multiplying these corrections implies a total incompleteness of @xmath189 , and on this basis we increased the value of @xmath171 to @xmath190 .",
    "figure [ fignz ] plots 2dfgrs - nvss matches in redshift bins of width @xmath191 , together with the low - redshift fit described above .",
    "a constant @xmath159 is a fairly good approximation at low redshifts ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "this flat distribution arises because the overall redshift distribution is a sum of that due to agn and that due to starburst galaxies ; @xmath159 increases with @xmath193 for the agn , but decreases with @xmath193 for the starbursters .",
    "figure [ fignz ] also displays the predictions of the luminosity function models of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) and willott ( 2001 ) . as explained above",
    ", the large extrapolations involved render these models a poor fit to the redshift distribution at mjy flux levels , and their use without modification at low redshift would have caused significant error .",
    "we used equation [ eqpktocl ] to predict the @xmath0 spectrum from our fiducial models of the spatial power spectrum ( section [ secpkmod ] ) and the radial distribution of the sources ( section [ secnz ] ) .",
    "we found that a good match to the measured angular power spectrum resulted if the nvss sources were assigned a constant linear bias factor @xmath194 ( figure [ figclmod ] ) ; @xmath195 provides a very poor fit to the results .",
    "the bias factor of the radio galaxies is analyzed more thoroughly in section [ secbias ] .",
    "we note that these measurements of the radio galaxy @xmath0 spectrum at low @xmath10 are _ not _ directly probing the large - scale , small @xmath13 , region of the power spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "investigation of the integrands of equations [ eqclkapp ] and [ eqclxapp ] revealed that the majority of the signal is built up at low redshift , @xmath196 ( see figure [ figkz ] ) , where small - scale spatial power is able to contribute on large angular scales ( i.e. contribute to low multipoles ) .",
    "higher redshift objects principally serve to dilute the clustering amplitude .",
    "this is unfortunate : the potential of radio galaxies distributed to @xmath160 to probe _ directly _ the large - scale power spectrum is forfeited by projection effects . in order to realize this potential , we must measure redshifts for the nvss sources .",
    "a three - dimensional map extending to @xmath160 would directly yield @xmath11 on large scales , defining the `` turn - over '' sketched in figure [ figpkmod ] .",
    "the enhanced radio galaxy bias apparent in figure [ figclmod ] is consistent with the nature of agn host galaxies : optically luminous ellipticals inhabiting moderate to rich environments .",
    "similarly high radio galaxy bias factors have been inferred from measurements of the spatial power spectrum of low - redshift radio galaxies ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) and from deprojection of the nvss angular correlation function @xmath9 ( blake & wall 2002a ; overzier et al .",
    "2003 ) . furthermore , boughn & crittenden ( 2002 ) cross - correlated nvss and cmb overdensities in a search for the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( see also nolta et al .",
    "their analysis included fitting theoretical models to the nvss angular correlation function .",
    "they derived good fits for a slightly lower linear bias factor than ours , @xmath197 .",
    "this difference is due to the assumed redshift distribution .",
    "boughn & crittenden also used the dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) average model , but we corrected this model using observational data at low redshifts @xmath169 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fignz ] , our correction reduces the number of low - redshift sources , necessitating a higher bias factor to recover the same angular correlations .    in order to derive a formal confidence interval for the linear bias parameter @xmath3 we must incorporate the effects of uncertainties in the underlying model parameters ( by marginalizing over those parameters ) . with this in mind",
    ", we assumed gaussian priors for hubble s constant @xmath198 , for the matter density @xmath199 , and for the primordial spectral index @xmath200 .",
    "the widths of these priors were inspired by the cosmological parameter analysis combining the wmap satellite observations of the cmb and the 2dfgrs galaxy power spectrum ( spergel et al . 2003 , table 7 , column 3 ) and are a good representation of our current knowledge of the cosmological model . in addition , we considered variations in the model for the radial distribution of nvss sources at low redshift ( section [ secnz ] ) , using a more general fitting formula @xmath201 to describe the probability distribution for @xmath169 . for each pair of values of @xmath202 we derived the chi - squared statistic between the model and the observations , @xmath203 , which we converted into an ( unnormalized ) probability density @xmath204 .",
    "our model is thus specified by values of ( @xmath3 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath151 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 ) from which we can calculate a model @xmath0 spectrum and hence a chi - squared statistic with the observations , @xmath209 , corresponding to a probability density @xmath210 .",
    "we used the spherical harmonic estimation of the @xmath0 spectrum as the observational data . after multiplying @xmath211 by the redshift distribution probability density @xmath212 and the gaussian prior probability densities for @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath151 , we derived the probability distribution for @xmath3 by integrating over each of the other parameters .",
    "we do not marginalize over the normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath4 , because this quantity is degenerate with @xmath3 ( using equations [ eqrad ] , [ eqclxapp ] and [ eqsigsq ] : @xmath213 ) .",
    "the resulting normalized probability distribution for @xmath214 is displayed in figure [ figb0 ] , from which we determined a @xmath1 confidence region @xmath215 . when combined with the wmap determination of @xmath216 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , we infer that @xmath217 .",
    "this investigation has measured the angular power spectrum of radio galaxies for the first time , yielding consistent results through the application of two independent methods : direct spherical harmonic analysis and maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "the nvss covers a sufficient fraction of sky ( @xmath8 per cent ) that spherical harmonic analysis is very effective , with minimal correlations amongst different multipoles .",
    "the form of the @xmath0 spectrum can be reproduced by standard models for the present - day spatial power spectrum and for the radial distribution of nvss sources  provided that this latter is modified at low redshift through comparison with optical galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "the results strongly indicate that radio galaxies possess high bias with respect to matter fluctuations .",
    "a constant linear bias @xmath194 permits a good fit , and by marginalizing over the other parameters of the model we deduce a @xmath1 confidence interval @xmath215 where @xmath4 describes the normalization of the matter power spectrum .",
    "we find that the majority of the angular power spectrum signal is generated at low redshifts , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in order to exploit the potential of radio galaxies to probe spatial fluctuations on the largest scales , we require individual redshifts for the nvss sources .",
    "we thank jasper wall and steve rawlings for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper .",
    "we acknowledge valuable discussions with carole jackson concerning cross - matching the nvss and 2dfgrs source catalogues .",
