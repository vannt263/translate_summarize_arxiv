    "in lorentzian geometry it is useful to use the boost - weights to categorise tensors @xcite .",
    "this was particularly useful in studying degenerate metrics and it is thus useful to generalise this to the pseudo - riemannian case @xcite . in this short paper",
    "we will consider an arbitrary - dimensional pseudo - riemannian space of signature @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetry group of frame - rotations in this case is @xmath3 .",
    "we will utilise the decomposition where any element , @xmath4 , can be written @xmath5 , where we have split it into an compact spin piece , @xmath6 , an abelian boost piece , @xmath7 , and a piece consisting of null - rotations @xmath8 . for @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and there are @xmath10-independent boosts ( which equals the real rank of @xmath3 ) .",
    "we want to utilise this decomposition and we can do so by choosing a suitable frame .",
    "therefore , we introduce a null - frame such that the metric can be written : s^2=2(^1n^1+  +^in^i+  +^kn^k)+_ijm^im^j , where the indices @xmath11 .",
    "the spins will act on @xmath12 , each boost will act on the pair of null - vectors , while the null - rotations will in general mix up null - vectors and spatial vectors .",
    "more precisely ,    & & ^i=^i ,  ^i = n^i ,  ^i = m^i _  jm^j ,   ( m^i _  j)so(m ) , + & & ^i = e^_i^i ,  ^i = e^-_in^i ,  ^i = m^j , while the null - rotations can be split up at each level . considering the subset of forms @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , we can then consider the @xmath15-th level null - rotations w.r.t .",
    "@xmath16 :   ^i=^i - z__i^_i-12z__iz^_in^i ,  ^i = n^i ,  ^_i=^_i+z^_in^i , and similarly for @xmath17 .",
    "note that there are @xmath18 null - rotations at @xmath15th level , making @xmath19 in total .",
    "first we need to introduce some mathematical tools which are useful for studying these metrics .",
    "consider the @xmath10 independent boosts : ( ^1,n^1 ) & & ( e^_1 ^ 1,e^-_1n^1 ) + ( ^2,n^2 ) & & ( e^_2 ^ 2,e^-_2n^2 ) + & & + ( ^k , n^k ) & & ( e^_k^k , e^-_kn^k ) . for a tensor @xmath20 , we can further consider the boost weight of the components of this tensor as @xmath21 , as follows .",
    "if the component @xmath22 transforms as : @xmath23 then we will say the component @xmath22 is of boost weight @xmath24 .",
    "we can now decompose a tensor into boost weights , in particular , @xmath25 where @xmath26 means the projection onto the components of boost weight @xmath27 .    by considering tensor products",
    ", the boost weights will obey an additive rule : ( t s)_*b*=_+=*b*(t)_(s)_.    let us consider a tensor , @xmath20 , and list a few conditions that the tensor components may fulfill :    [ cond]we define the following conditions :    1 .",

    "4 .    5 .",
    "@xmath28 , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "we will say that a tensor @xmath20 possesses the @xmath37-property if and only if there exists a null frame such that condition ( b1 ) above is satisfied .",

    "we will say that a tensor @xmath20 possesses the @xmath2-property if and only if there exists a null frame such that conditions b1)-b@xmath10 ) in definition [ cond ] are satisfied , _ and",
    "_ @xmath39    for tensor products we have :    1 .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath40 possess the @xmath1- and @xmath41-property , respectively . assuming , with no loss of generality , that @xmath42 , then @xmath43 , and any contraction thereof , possesses the @xmath44-property .",
    "2 .   let @xmath20 and @xmath40 possess the @xmath1- and @xmath2-property , respectively .",
    "then @xmath43 , and any contraction thereof , possesses the @xmath1-property . if @xmath45 , then @xmath43 possesses the @xmath2-property .",
    "3 .   let @xmath20 and @xmath40 both possess the @xmath2-property .",
    "then @xmath43 , and any contraction thereof , possesses the @xmath2-property .",
    "it is also useful to define a set of related conditions .",
    "consider a tensor @xmath20 that does not necessarily meet any of the conditions above .",
    "however , since the boost weights @xmath46 , we can consider a linear @xmath47 transformation , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a lattice in @xmath50 . now , if there exist a @xmath4 such that the transformed boost weights , @xmath51 , satisfy ( some ) of the conditions in def.[cond ] , we will say , correspondingly , that @xmath20 possesses the @xmath52-property . similarly , for the @xmath53-property .    if we have two tensors @xmath20 and @xmath40 both possessing the @xmath54-property , with the same @xmath4 , then when we take the tensor product : @xmath55 therefore , the tensor product will also possess the @xmath54-property , with the same @xmath4 .",
    "this would be useful for us later when considering degenerate tensors and metrics with degenerate curvature tensors .",
    "note also that @xmath54-property reduces to the @xmath1-property for @xmath56 ( the identity ) .",
    "a tensor @xmath20 satisfying the @xmath54-property or @xmath53-property is generically not determined by its invariants in the sense that there may be another tensor @xmath57 with the same invariants .",
    "the @xmath1-property therefore implies a certain _ degeneracy _ in the algebraic structure of the tensor .",
    "we can also use the boost - weight decomposition to classifiy the weyl tensors @xcite of arbitrary signature . by successively using null - rotations at each level",
    ", we can use the well - known boost - weight classification to give an algebraic classification of arbitrary - signature ( weyl ) tensors . at each level we can consider the null - rotations leaving invariant the @xmath58-dimensional metric 2^in^i+ _ _",
    "the metric @xmath59 will be of signature @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , consider a weyl tensor , @xmath61 , which can be decomposed into boost weight components , as explained earlier . to find the primary level algebraic type , we consider the components : @xmath62 where @xmath63 means all the components of boost - weight @xmath64 , etc .",
    "we can now use the standard algebraic classification of lorentzian tensors at each level ; e.g. , will say that @xmath61 is of primary ( or primary level ) algebraic type iii if there is a frame such that @xmath65 .    in order to get the second level type",
    ", we use the prefered form from the primary level . consider the highest non - zero primary boost - weight component @xmath66 .",
    "again , we can decompose as follows : @xmath67 the second level type can then be found by trying to find a frame ( using the 2th level null - rotations which preserves the primary boost - weights )",
    ".    the full algebraic type will then be the sum of the prime , second , @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath10th - level types .",
    "we will write this as follows ; e.g. , @xmath69 , means the type at 1st , 2nd , and 3rd level are i , d , and iii , respectively .    for weyl tensors obeying the @xmath1,- or @xmath2-property , we have the following : _ i : & & ( _ i , g, ...",
    "n * : & & ( ii , ii, ... ,ii , iii)or simpler .",
    "in the special case of 4d neutral signature ( ns ) space , the weyl operator , @xmath70 , splits into a self - dual and anti - self - dual part : @xmath71 . in @xcite law",
    "classified the weyl tensor of ns metrics using the weyl operator the ( anti-)self - dual operators which can be defined as : @xmath72    each of the parts can be considered to be symmetric and tracefree with respect to the 3-dimensional lorentzian metric with signature @xmath73 .",
    "consquently , each of the operators @xmath74 can be classified according to `` segre type''(the `` type '' refers to law s enumeration ) :    * type ia : @xmath75 * type ib : @xmath76 * type ii : @xmath77 * type iii:@xmath78 .    as in @xcite",
    "is also advantageous to refine law s enumeration for the special cases :    * type d : @xmath79 * type n : @xmath80    we first note that the refined law classification translate into our boost - weight classification as follows ( for each tensor @xmath81 ) @xmath82    as for the full weyl tensor @xmath83 , there is no simple 1 - 1 correspondence like above . in some sence , there is a `` tilted '' correpondence ( using a map @xmath4 in `` boost '' space ) . in terms of the @xmath52- and @xmath2-property , which measures a degeneracy of the weyl tensor , we can relate it to the law classification as follows .    for a 4d neutral signature space ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , then :    1 .   if _ either _ the self - dual _ or _ the anti - self - dual part of the weyl tensor is algebraically special of type ii , d , iii , n or o , then the weyl tensor possesses ( at least ) the @xmath86-property .",
    "2 .   if _ both _",
    "the self - dual _ and _ the anti - self - dual part of the weyl tensor are algebraically special of type ii , d , iii , n or o , then the weyl tensor possesses ( at least ) the @xmath87-property .",
    "3 .   if _ both _ the self - dual _ and _ anti - self - dual part of the weyl tensor are algebraically special of type iii , n or o , then the weyl tensor possesses the @xmath2-property .",
    "this result gives us a statement in terms of degeneracy of the weyl tensor .",
    "in particular , it tell us that if one of the parts of the weyl tensor is algebraically special , then the weyl tensor is degenerate in the sence that its not determined by its invariants .",
    "( first column ) and @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( second column ) .",
    "the axes are the two boost weights @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    ", width=377 ]    in fig [ fig1 ] , we have illustrated the boost weight components of the ricci tensor ( the ` diamond ' ) and weyl tensor ( the ` cross ' ) in 4d neutral signature .",
    "each of the weyl tensors @xmath81 are the diagonal and anti - diagonal components ( there are two independent boost - weight @xmath92 components of the weyl tensor @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that for 4d neutral signature , a ricci tensor obeying the @xmath2-property has a 4-step nilpotent ricci operator : @xmath93 . of signature @xmath88 , @xmath89 ,",
    "possessing the @xmath2-property need not be @xmath94-step nilpotent , however it must be @xmath95-step nilpotent ; i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the weyl tensor possessing the @xmath2-property in signatures @xmath97 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 are @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively . ] by inspection we see that for a ricci tensor obeying the @xmath2-property , we have that the powers of @xmath100 must be of the following types ( or simplier ) : @xmath101    as an illustration , let us consider the following 4d ns spacetime which is a vsi spacetime @xcite : s^2=2u^1(v^1+hu^1+w__1x^_1)+2u^2v^2 , where w__1x^_1&= & v^1w^(1)_u^2(u^1,u^2)u^2+w^(0)_u^2(u^1,u^2,v^2)u^2+w^(0)_v^2(u^1,u^2,v^2)v^2 , + h&= & v^1 h^(1)(u^1,u^2,v^2)+h^(0)(u^1,u^2,v^2 ) .",
    "in general this metric is of ricci type @xmath102 . here , the term with @xmath103 contributes with a boost - weight @xmath104 component .",
    "consequently , if @xmath105 , then this spacetime is of type @xmath106 and we have @xmath107 .",
    "the above metric also allows for the additional subcases @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the types given here are not complete in the sense that the metric above allows for the two distinct cases of @xmath102 , where @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
