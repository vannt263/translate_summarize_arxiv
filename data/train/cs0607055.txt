    "chordal graphs are useful for many practical problems . for example",
    "they arise in the context of sparse linear systems ( rose@xcite ) , relational data bases ( bernstein and goodman@xcite ) , positive definite completions ( e.g.  grone et al.@xcite , fukuda et al.@xcite , waki et al.@xcite ) . in statistics , graphical models have received increasing attention ( e.g.  whittaker@xcite , lauritzen@xcite ) .",
    "the decomposable graphical models determined by chordal graphs are particularly convenient and have been extensively studied by many authors ( e.g.  dobra@xcite , geiger , meek and sturmfels@xcite , hara and takemura@xcite , @xcite ) . in view of these applications",
    "it is important to study properties of chordal graphs .    in this article",
    "we focus on characterizations of clique trees for a chordal graph .",
    "a clique tree is an intersection graph representation of a chordal graph and in general there are many clique trees for a chordal graph .",
    "clique trees are very important from the algorithmic point of view for many techniques based on chordal graphs .",
    "they have been used to solve domination problems on directed path graphs ( booth and johnson@xcite ) .",
    "they also provide efficient algorithms for probability propagation in graphical models ( e.g.  jensen@xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to characterize the set of clique trees in three ways .",
    "we first address properties of boundary cliques defined by shibata@xcite which form an important subclass of simplicial cliques .",
    "shibata@xcite showed that if a maximal clique @xmath0 is an endpoint of some clique tree , then @xmath0 is a boundary clique .",
    "we show that the converse of this fact holds and give some characterizations of endpoints of clique trees by using the notion of boundary cliques . in this paper",
    "we also use an alternative terminology and call a boundary clique _ simply separated _ , because a boundary clique meets a single minimal vertex separator .",
    "the characterization of endpoints of clique trees is essential for proving theoretical facts on chordal graphs by induction on the number of maximal cliques .",
    "secondly we consider the relation between the set of clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques .",
    "lauritzen@xcite presents two ( randomized ) algorithms , one of which generates a clique tree from a perfect sequence given as an input and the other generates a perfect sequence of maximal cliques from a clique tree given as an input .",
    "based on these algorithms , we can define a symmetric binary relation between the set of clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques . in this article",
    "we consider to describe this relation using a bipartite graph .",
    "we prove that the bipartite graph is connected for every chordal graph .",
    "this result allows us to construct a connected markov chain over the set of clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques of a given chordal graph .",
    "the markov chain is potentially useful for optimizing over the set of clique trees or over the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques . in the proof of the connectedness of the bipartite graph we use the induction on the number of maximal cliques and we can confirm the usefulness of our characterization of endpoints of clique tree by using the notion of boundary cliques .",
    "finally we consider the question of uniqueness of clique trees .",
    "as mentioned above a chordal graph may have many clique trees . as two extremes",
    ", there exists a chordal graph such that an arbitrary tree is a clique tree for it and there also exists a chordal graph such that the clique tree is unique .",
    "we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on chordal graphs for the arbitrariness and for the uniqueness of their clique trees .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we prepare notations and present some preliminary facts on the simplicial vertices , the clique trees and the perfect sequences of maximal cliques of a chordal graph . in section 3",
    "we consider boundary cliques and give some characterization of endpoints of clique trees in relation to boundary cliques .",
    "we also characterize a final maximal clique in a perfect sequence by using the notion of boundary cliques . in section 4",
    "we define a symmetric binary relation between the set of clique trees and the set of perfect sequences of maximal cliques and consider to describe the relation by a bipartite graph .",
    "in particular we prove that the bipartite graph is connected .",
    "in section 5 we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the arbitrariness and the uniqueness of clique trees .",
    "we end the paper with some concluding remarks in section 6 .",
    "in this section we prepare notations , definitions and some basic results on chordal graphs required in the subsequent sections . throughout this paper",
