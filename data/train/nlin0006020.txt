    "in the present paper we continue numerical experiments @xcite with the khalatnikov - kroyter model @xcite developed for a qualitative description of the wave turbulence of second sound in helium .",
    "the model is specified by an effective non ",
    "hermitian hamiltonian : @xmath5 where we slightly changed the notations in ref.@xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the two linear oscillators via complex phase ",
    "space variables @xmath6 and the frequencies @xmath7 with phenomenological dissipation parameters @xmath8 .",
    "two other parameters of the model represent a nonlinear coupling @xmath9 of the two oscillators , and the driving force @xmath10 .",
    "the motion equations @xmath11 were numerically integrated together with the corresponding linearized equations ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "particularly , all four lyapunov exponents ( @xmath12 ) were computed .",
    "one of them , whose eigenvector goes along the trajectory , is always zero while the sum of all @xmath13 is the constant rate of the phase space volume contraction .    surprisingly , at a relatively weak force @xmath10 this most simple model does describe the birth of turbulence ( dynamical chaos ) in a physical system .",
    "this was the main subject of studies in ref.@xcite .    as the force grows",
    "the two  freedom model is losing any relation to the real physical turbulence which is a multi(infinitely)freedom phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , it seems of some interest , for the general theory of dynamical systems , to compare the structure and properties of a chaotic attractor in such an opposite limit represented by a sample model under consideration .",
    "it was the main motivation for us to continue general studies of the model on unrestricted range of its parameters .",
    "in the spirit of the theory of turbulence we introduce , first , a unique dimensionless parameter , similar to the reynolds number , which determines all the dimensionless characteristics of the motion . to this end , we choose @xmath14 as the three basic parameters , and form the desired combination @xmath15 which has the meaning of a dimensionless force . for this basic characteristic of the model were unique we need to fix all other dimensionless parameters : @xmath16 the values of all three ratios are chosen as in the previous studies @xcite . particularly , we keep @xmath17 , as well as the motion initial conditions @xmath18 this allows us to directly compare our new results with the former ones .",
    "in what follows we set @xmath19 in the basic relation ( 2.1 ) .",
    "invariance of @xmath0 with respect to variation of the three basic parameters gives us an extra freedom for choosing the latter in such a way to minimize the computation errors , and thus to reach higher values of @xmath0 .    in the present studies we were primarily interested in the properties of chaotic attractor .",
    "one of its principal characteristic is the metric ( @xmath20 ) that is the set of signs of the lyapunov exponents . as in the previous studies we did observe only one metric of the three possible",
    ", namely @xmath21 with a single zero exponent @xmath22 .",
    "the next , more interesting , characteristic of attractor is the fractal ( noninteger ) dimension . by now",
    ", there is a dozen of various definitions for such a dimension ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . from physical point of view",
    "those all are meaningful and acceptable in principle .",
    "however , in numerical experiments the two of them are much more preferable .",
    "these make use of the lyapunov exponents only which greatly simplifies the computation .",
    "we have chosen one , due to kaplan and yorke , because it is more close to other definitions @xcite .",
    "it is given by the relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the largest integer for which the sum @xmath25 .",
    "this is the simplest and widely used method for calculating dimension . in the model under consideration",
    "the dimension of a chaotic attractor is always within the interval @xmath26 .",
    "the upper bound corresponds to the dimension of the whole phase space , while the lower is the condition for chaos ( @xmath27 , see eq.(2.4 ) ) .",
    "the second characteristic of a chaotic attractor , closely related to ( but different from ) the former is the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath28 . in dimensionless form",
    "it is @xmath29 accordingly , the dimensionless sum of all the exponents @xmath30 ( see eq.(1.3 ) ) .    besides , we computed two other , geometrical , characteristics of attractor : the average size and shape .",
    "the former is represented by attractor s rms radius in phase space @xmath31 where @xmath32 are dimensionless variables , and the brackets @xmath33 denote the time average along a trajectory . in all cases",
    "the average shift of attractors @xmath34 was relatively small .",
    "the attractor shape is characterized by the ratio @xmath35    the results are presented and discussed in the next section .",
    "in fig.1 the attractor dimension @xmath36 , eq.(2.5a ) , is plotted in dependence on the principal parameter @xmath0 , eq.(2.1 ) .",
    "the huge range of @xmath0 comprises almost five orders of magnitude , from the first chaos border at @xmath37 up to @xmath38 limitted by the computation time ( about one full day ) .",
    "five separated groups of points are clearly seen followed by a number of scattered points .",
    "each group corresponds to a chaos window in @xmath0 separated from the neighbours by the limit ",
    "cycle windows . apparently , the latter also exist in the region of scattered points which all belong to chaotic attractors .",
    "however , these points are too few , because of computation difficulties , for the reliable location of any windows beyond @xmath39 .",
    "the first two groups , studied already in our previous work @xcite , certainly belong to different attractors with different chaos borders @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "it is natural , again in the spirit of the theory of turbulence , to introduce the principal argument of all dependences in the form : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corresponding chaos border which is characteristic , and different , for a particular attractor .",
    "the result of such a rescaling is shown in fig.2 : both groups have overlapped following some joint dependence @xmath43 .",
    "the first surprise was in that one of the lyapunov exponents proved to be nearly constant in the whole range of the empirical data : @xmath44 .",
    "even though the origin of this peculiarity is not known it allows for a simple relation of both empirical dependences in fig.2 . besides",
    ", we did use this result as an additional check of the computation accuracy .    indeed , using eqs.(1.3 ) ,",
    "( 2.4 ) , and ( 2.5a ) we obtain a simple relation @xmath45 with constant parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 whatever the dependence @xmath43 .",
    "the next , and the main , result was a very slow dependence on @xmath0 of all the dimensionless characteristics of chaotic attractors ( see figs.1 and 2 ) .",
    "this is why we make use of a logarithmic argument @xmath48 rather than of @xmath49 itself .",
    "that slow dependence prevents us from reaching a close vicinity of the upper bound @xmath50 , and thus from clarifying an interesting question in ref.@xcite : if the dimension does asymptotically approach this bound or , instead , saturates at some lower value of @xmath36 ( for farther discussion see next section ) .",
    "the maximal value actually reached in our numerical experiments was approximately @xmath51 only due to a rapid increase of the computation time as @xmath52 .",
    "the empirical dependence @xmath53 ( and hence @xmath54 as well ) has been constructed using the data for the two first groups in fig.1 with known @xmath42 values . to this end , let us assume , first , that @xmath53 does reach the upper bound as @xmath55 .",
    "further , fig.2 suggests that this dependence is close to linear near @xmath56 , hence we added the unity under logarithm in @xmath57 .",
    "finally , we use a simple relation : @xmath58 with a single fitting parameter @xmath59 .",
    "surprisingly , the simple empirical relation ( 3.3 ) fits , with a particular value of the fitting parameter @xmath60 , not only the points of the first two groups but also , with a reasonable accuracy ( especially for @xmath36 ) , the rest of points with unknown @xmath42 values set to zero in fig.2 .",
    "notice that deviations of empirical points from a smooth dependence are not due to computation errors , which were carefully checked , but apparently represent some fine structure of chaotic attractors we did not study in the present work ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .    still , the agreement between empirical data and analytical relation is not yet satisfactory especially for the three rightmost points with the biggest @xmath0 .    for improving the agreement we used two methods .",
    "first , we tried to fit the unknown @xmath42 values for the three groups of points around @xmath61 ( see fig.1 and the table ) .",
    "interestingly , the two groups seem to belong to the same attractor even though they are separated by a wide gap with limit cycles only . apparently , this is because of the fixed initial conditions ( 2.3 ) which may or",
    "may not find themselves within the attractor basin for a particular value of @xmath57 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we can not directly see the vicinity of chaos border for these three groups of points .",
    "hence , the two new values of @xmath42 are the fitting parameters unlike the first two .     [ 3 mm ] & & & & + number & chaos border & & size & shape + 1 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + 2 & @xmath66 & @xmath63 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + 2 & @xmath66 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + 3 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 + 4 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 + @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 +    beyond the five groups we managed to compute just a few scattered points which prevented the location of other attractors . in this region",
    "we used another method based on a simple assumption that each point belongs to a separate attractor whose chaos border is directly related to the position of this point @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a new fitting parameter .",
    "this method of a statistical nature is , in a sense , opposite to the first one .",
    "the assumption ( 3.4 ) is very crude , of course , but it allows us to farther improve the agreement with empirical relations ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) including two points at @xmath87 but not the last one at the biggest @xmath88 .",
    "certainly , a couple of these abnormal points is too few for any definite conclusions .",
    "yet , they may , and apparently do as we shall see below , indicate a different asymptotic behavior , as @xmath89 , compared to the simple relations ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) . to clarify this important question we turned to the very limit @xmath90 . to reach this limit we may fix parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , and set @xmath91 ( see scaling ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) ) . in this way we arrive at a conservative system with the simple hermitian hamiltonian : @xmath92 where the latter equality is due to the initial conditions ( 2.3 ) .",
    "a few sample runs of this limit system revealed that all characteristics ( 2.5 ) but the dimension @xmath36 of an energy surface now , which is the limit of a chaotic attractor for a finite @xmath93 , kept growing with time .",
    "this suggests an unbounded motion along some non  compact energy surface , and moreover with the ever increasing dimensional lyapunov exponent @xmath94 for @xmath95 .    as to the dimension of the energy surface itself it quickly converges to the maximal value @xmath50 .",
    "at the first glance , it appears strange as one would expect this surface to be three  dimensional .",
    "the explanation of the apparent paradox is the following .",
    "the metric of the motion @xmath96 has now two zero lyapunov exponents : one corresponds to the eigenvector along a trajectoty , as usual , while the other one is associated with the eigenvector across the energy surface ( the so  called marginal instability , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it means that this metric characterizes an infinitely narrow four  dimentional layer around the energy surface rather than the surface itself .",
    "notice that the invariant measure of ergodic motion ( the so  called microcanonical distribution ) on energy surface is determined by the phase ",
    "space volume in that layer , and not by area on the surface .",
    "increasing @xmath28 in the limit ( 3.5 ) is at variance with the asymptotics of eq.(3.2 ) for @xmath97 .",
    "indeed @xmath98 to cope with this difficulty we need a power  law argument in the right  hand side of eq.(3.3 ) rather than a logarithmic one , @xmath57 .",
    "to this end , we simply added to the latter a power  law term in the form @xmath99 with two parameters , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the latter characterizes the crossover to the asymptotic behavior where the lyapunov exponent is described by the relation @xmath102 the limit behavior in system ( 3.5 ) ( @xmath28 growth ) implies @xmath103 .",
    "there is an interesting possibility to calculate more accurate value of @xmath100 using our preliminary empirical data for the limit ( 3.5 ) .",
    "the point is that conservative system ( 3.5 ) possesses only one quantity of the frequency dimension , the inverse time .",
    "so , one may conjecture that the variable @xmath104 plays in conservative system ( 3.5 ) a role similar to that of @xmath93 in our main dissipative model ( 1.1 ) . according to our preliminary data all the motion characteristics ( 2.5 ) but @xmath36 in the former case",
    "are growing with time as a power law . particularly , @xmath105 . by comparison with eq.(3.8 ) we obtain @xmath106 to be used below .",
    "with all these improvements we show in fig.3 our final fitting the empirical data for the attractor dimension and lyapunov exponents .",
    "the most interesting result of our studies is finding eventually the two quite different chaotic structures with respect to their dependence on the principal parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the most of our empirical data belong to the structure with the slow , logarithmic , dependence .",
    "it comprises the region from @xmath107 up to the crossover @xmath108 beyond @xmath109 the chaotic structure becomes turbulent with a relatively fast , power ",
    "law , dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover between the two regions is clearly seen in fig.3 from the @xmath54 dependence , and can be noticed in @xmath53 variation as well .",
    "so far , we have no explanation as to a large value of this crossover .",
    "however , notice that in the logarithmic scale @xmath57 the crossover @xmath110 is not that big .",
    "since the logarithmic dependence in eq.(3.3 ) becomes linear for small @xmath49 there is actually the third region bounded from above by one more crossover @xmath111 .",
    "this region of threshold chaos is most clearly seen in fig.1 .",
    "all the regions can be descibed by unified and relatively simple empirical relations ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) , and ( 3.7 ) to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "an interesting peculiarity of these relations is the discontinuity of the first derivative @xmath112 at @xmath113 .",
    "the ratio of the slopes above to below this point @xmath114 is independent of the function itself , similar to eq.(3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we display in fig.4 the behavior of two geometrical characteristics of chaotic attractor , the size @xmath115 ( 2.5c ) and shape @xmath116 ( 2.5d ) . we did not attempt to construct the empirical relations for these characteristics .",
    "however , a clear qualitative behavior of those is also interesting and important .",
    "first , both @xmath115 and @xmath116 grow with @xmath57 which is also in agreement with the limit behavior in system ( 3.5 ) .",
    "in other words , the attractor becomes more and more large and elongated .",
    "another interesting point is in that the geometrical characteristics are multivalued that is specific , at the same value of @xmath57 , for a particular attractor .",
    "this confirms that we , indeed , have found some different attractors as summarized in the table .",
    "in the present work , which continues our previous studies @xcite , we investigate the structure of chaotic atractors in the khalatnikov - kroyter model of two freedoms ( 1.1 ) . as was shown in ref.@xcite this simple model describes the birth of the wave turbulence ( dynamical chaos ) in a real very complicated physical phenomenon - the dynamics of the second sound in helium ii driven by an external force @xmath10 .",
    "the model is applicable for weak force only which proved to be sufficient for producing chaos .",
    "it means that under particular conditions such a few  freedom model can represent some features of the many ",
    "freedom turbulent structure .",
    "the main goal of the present studies was to find out what would be peculiarities of the few ",
    "freedom turbulence in a wide range of the parameters , particularly of the driving force . to put it other way , we were interested in the structure of the few  freedom chaos as compared to that of the multi ",
    "freedom one .    to this end , we have chosen a number of dimensionless characteristics of the chaotic structure ( 2.5 ) , und studied their dependence on a single dimensionless parameter @xmath0 ( 2.1 ) in a series of numerical experiments .",
    "we had expected some qualitative differences between the few and multi  freedom chaos , yet the surprise was in the nature of the difference which proved to be the dependence of chaos characteristics on the principal parameter @xmath0 . while in the multi ",
    "freedom chaos this dependence is fast ( a power law ) in a few  freedom chaos it is very slow ( logarithmic ) .",
    "even though our studies were restricted to a particular model we conjecture that this principal difference is of a generic nature .",
    "apparently , it is related to the strict limitation of the attractor dimension in a few  freedom system ( to the interval @xmath117 in our model ) .    in spite of satisfaction with this finding we went on in numerical experiments trying to reach as large @xmath0 as possible in a reasonable computation time ( days ) , and it was not in vain !",
    "first , we tried to find some indication , if any , of deviations from the original empirical relations which could be interpreted as a lower asymptotic dimension ( @xmath118 ) than assumed above ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "eventually , we have found the deviation but of the opposite sign ( see fig.1 and 3 ) ! even though this is just three points we put forward a different explanation - the transition to a new , power law , dependence of the attractor characteristics which is similar to that in a multi  freedom system ( section 3 ) .",
    "remarkably , all the three regions can be described by a unified empirical relation which is rather simple and reasonably accurate .",
    "particularly , this confirms the assumption that ( rather than answer to the question if ) the dimension of chaotic attractor in the model considered does reach the upper bound @xmath50 ( see eq.(3.3 ) and above ) .    at the time of publication ref.@xcite , some preliminary numerical experiments at very large @xmath123 have presented the first evidence for the transition to a power ",
    "law dependence in our few  freedom model .",
    "it was just three points for @xmath119 near the crossover ( 3.9 ) marked in fig.3 by squares .",
    "by now , we have collected much more empirical data at the crossover and beyond , up to @xmath124 .",
    "these are also shown in fig.3 ( circles ) , and perfectly fit , to a less accuracy though , the previously found empirical dependence @xmath125 .",
    "each point in the new region costed about a full day of work for one processor on the alpha supercomputer .    unlike this surprising agreement in extrapolation of @xmath119 , the new data for @xmath126 show a systematic deviation down to @xmath127 above crossover ( 3.9 ) . at the moment",
    "it is not clear if this decrease is caused by insufficient computation accuracy , we had to permit in order to cope with the enormous computation time , or a real transition for @xmath126 is observed , indeed . in any case , the corresponding change in @xmath119 is negligible in this region ( see eq.(3.2 ) ) .",
    "there is an interesting possibility to compare the unexpected and unexplained invariance of @xmath128 in our model with the data in ref.@xcite for a close model of two freedoms also . in the latter work",
    "the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor was studied in detail . for the main set of model s parameters",
    "the lyapunov exponents are @xmath129 with the same metric @xmath20 ( 2.4 ) as in our model , the dissipativity @xmath130 , and the attractor dimension @xmath131 which is well within the logarithmic region ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "even more interesting is the ratio @xmath132 which differs from our result by 10% only .    in the very conclusion",
    ", we would like to mention that an important question how univeral the described structure of the few  freedom chaos might be , remains open and certainly deserves further studies .",
    "in particular , the above condition for a power  law asymptotics ( unbounded motion in conservative limit ( 3.5 ) ) is hardly generic .",
    "rather , it is characteristic for a more narrow class of nonlinear models as compared to those with the wide logarithmic region .",
