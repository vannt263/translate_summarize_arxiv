    "shells and supershells have long been studied in external galaxies , as well as in our own milky way , as a probe of the star formation feedback processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most shells form from the combined effects of stellar winds and supernovae that inject large quantities of energy ( @xmath5  ergs ) into the ism .",
    "a few studies have directly identified the shell power source as an ob association ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in these cases , however , standard wind blown bubble models ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) fail to properly account for the shells radii and expansion velocities . as noted by @xcite",
    "the model typically predicts radii that are too large and expansion velocities that are too small when compared to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) shell population .    in the nearby large and small magellanic clouds the large - scale structure of the ism",
    "is dominated by hundreds of expanding shells @xcite .",
    "many of these have been studied in an attempt to understand the dynamics of shells @xcite and their role in the ism .",
    "unfortunately , much less is known about the dynamics , density and distribution of  shells in the milky way .",
    "early  surveys of the milky way resulted in the discovery of many shells @xcite .",
    "new high resolution surveys of the galactic plane , such as the canadian and southern galactic plane surveys @xcite are increasing this number and our knowledge of the small - scale structure of galactic .",
    "we here report on the identification of two large shells , gsh  304 - 00 - 12 and gsh  305 + 01 - 24 , located at the edge of the nearby sagittarius - carina spiral arm .",
    "the coalsack nebula lies between the sun and the near edge of gsh  304 - 00 - 12 , though it does not appear physically related to the shell .",
    "we believe that gsh  305 + 01 - 24 is associated with the centaurus ob1 stellar association .",
    "we employ a very simple model for a wind - blown bubble to show that the shell is well explained by the catalogued stars in cen ob1 . in  [ sec : obs ] we present the observations and data analysis . in  [ sec : new shells ] we describe the shells morphologically and dynamically and suggest a geometry to explain their characteristics . in  [ subsec : cenob1 ] we explore the relationship of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 with cen ob1 .",

    "the parkes portion of the sgps covers @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the observations were made during four observing sessions on 1998 december 15 - 16 , 1999 june 18 - 21 , 1999 september 18 - 27 , and 2000 march 10 - 15 .",
    "observations were made by the process of mapping `` on - the - fly '' with the inner seven beams of the multibeam system .",
    "the telescope was scanned through three degrees in galactic latitude while recording data in 5  s samples .",

    "the center frequency was switched between 1419  mhz and 1422.125  mhz every 5  s. to remove the bandpass shape each sample was divided by the previous frequency switched sample and the residual bandpass shape fitted with a series of fourier components .",
    "the spectra were then multiplied by the mean of the reference signal over the spectrum to reconstruct the emission with a flat baseline .",
    "this technique for bandpass calibration has the advantage that continuum information is retained but changes in the bandpass shape during the course of the observing day are removed .",
    "absolute brightness temperature calibration of the  line data was performed from daily observations of the iau standard regions s6 and s9 @xcite .",
    "these data were shifted to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) by applying a phase shift in the fourier domain .",

    "the shell is a large elliptical structure extending to @xmath21 in an arc that is nearly symmetric about the plane . for clarity",
    ", the shell is shown again in fig .",

    "there is a vertical line marking the position of the latitude cut and a cross - hair marking the position of the velocity profile .",

    "is roughly constant . at the central velocity of @xmath22",
    "the shell is brightest on the high longitude end of the images and traces a faint arc through the low - longitude end . towards larger velocities ( i.e. towards the local gas )",

    "the caps of the shell , on both the near and far sides are not readily detected .",

    "[ fig : shell ] & [ fig : annotated ] , the emission void above the plane contains a vertical filament at @xmath31 , extending from @xmath32 to the top of the shell .",
    "this filament appears to correspond to the galactic worm gw 305.5 + 9.4 @xcite .    using the galactic rotation model of @xcite and adopting the iau standard values for the sun s orbital velocity , @xmath33  , and galactic center distance , @xmath34  kpc",
    ", we estimate the distance to gsh 304 - 00 - 12 from the central velocity of @xmath22  . assuming a velocity error of @xmath35  to account for streaming motions @xcite , we determine a distance of @xmath36 kpc . at this distance",
    "the shell has physical diameters of 280  pc and 200  pc in the longitude and latitude directions , respectively .",
    "the near edge of the sagittarius - carina arm is at @xmath37 kpc @xcite .",
    "although the shell distance errors are large , the coincidence of the shell and spiral arm distances suggests that the shell is at the edge of the arm .",
    "gsh 304 - 00 - 12 has a velocity full width of @xmath38  .",
    "disentangling the spatial extent of the shell from the physical expansion is difficult . because of galactic rotation , structures that span hundreds of parsecs",
    "will be observed over a range of radial velocities , even if they are not expanding .",
    "the velocity - distance relationship can be partially separated by considering the velocity gradient along the line of sight . at the location of shell",
    "the velocity gradient is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , if the shell is roughly spherical , such that the shell diameter along the line of sight is on the order of 240 pc , it should extend over approximately 3  in velocity space .",
    "given the errors involved in deriving distances from the rotation curve , we believe that the velocity expanse due to the shell s physical extent in negligible . therefore , we estimate the shell s expansion velocity as half of the velocity full width , @xmath40  .",
    "this expansion velocity is comparable to shells of similar size in the smc and somewhat smaller than shells in the lmc @xcite .    the second shell",
    ", gsh  305 + 01 - 24 , has a smaller angular size of @xmath41 and is located at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44  .",
    "this shell is centered slightly above the plane and expands further above and below the plane than it does along the plane .",
    "an  image of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 at @xmath44  is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] overlaid with the positions of stars in the cen ob1 stellar association .",
    "the relationship of the shell to the stellar association is discussed below .    like the first shell , gsh  305 + 01 - 24",
    "does not have a clearly defined near cap .",
    "it does , however , seem to have a far cap .",
    "this shell appears to open conically from within the spiral arm at @xmath45  .",
    "it increases in angular size towards larger velocities in the interarm region and reaches its maximum size at @xmath44  .",
    "the angular size is relatively constant until @xmath46  , where the shell begins to close . beyond @xmath47  ,",
    "emission from the shell is confused with that of gsh 304 - 00 - 12 .",
    "the central velocity of @xmath44  implies a distance of @xmath48  kpc . at this distance",
    "the shell has physical radii of @xmath49  pc ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "gsh  305 + 01 - 24 has a velocity full width of @xmath51  .",
    "again , the velocity width due to the physical extent of this shell along the line of sight is probably negligible so we calculate an expansion velocity of @xmath52  .",
    "the ism along this line of sight is complicated .",
    "spectro - photometric mapping of the region show that the coalsack nebula is at an average distance of @xmath53 pc and consists of at least two overlapping clouds at 188 and 243 pc @xcite .",
    "co emission from the coalsack nebula is geometrically centered at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , covers @xmath56 on the sky and extends at least over the systemic velocity range @xmath57 to @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "self - absorption from gas in the coalsack was detected by @xcite and is also observed in the sgps dataset .",
    "the interarm region between the coalsack and the edge of the sgr - car arm is nearly devoid of dust and molecular gas and the near edge of the spiral arm is at about 1.3 kpc @xcite .",
    "and co emission between @xmath59 and covering lsr velocities between @xmath60 and @xmath61  corresponds to the sgr - car arm at a mean distance of @xmath62  kpc . for velocities in the range",
    "@xmath63  to @xmath64  the spiral arm is nearly perpendicular to the line of sight",
    ". there is a very slight velocity gradient , such that the high longitude end of the arm is at more negative velocities than the low longitude end .    for a small range of velocities ( @xmath65  ) gsh  305 + 01 - 24 overlaps with gsh  304 - 00 - 12 .",
    "though the shells are coincident in velocity space , there is no reason to believe that they are physically overlapping .",
    "the central velocities place the shells more than a kiloparsec apart and the line of sight widths are insufficient to overlap the shells .",
    "also , the morphology of the shells do not appear altered by an interaction .",
    "the overlap is most likely due to the expansion of the shells and not a true interaction .",
    "both shells appear to have formed in the edge of the sagittarius - carina arm .",
    "gsh  305 + 01 - 24 seems to close near the edge of the spiral arm , whereas gsh  304 - 00 - 12 expands into the interarm region .",
    "we suggest that gsh  304 - 00 - 12 experienced exaggerated expansion into the interarm region due to the pressure gradient leading away edge of the spiral arm .",
    "this explains the relatively constant size over the range of velocities covering the interarm region and the lack of a detectable near cap .",
    "gsh  305 - 00 - 12 also extends into the range of velocities covered by the coalsack nebula .",
    "the nebula at a distance of @xmath53 pc @xcite , however , is considerably closer than gsh  305 - 00 - 12 . unless the distance to gsh  304 - 00 - 12 has been significantly over - estimated or the shell s diameter along the line of sight far exceeds its diameter in the plane of the sky",
    ", it is unlikely that the shell is physically interacting with the coalsack .",
    "the lack of emission from a near cap , though , could alternately be explained by absorption by cold  in the coalsack .",
    "the lower portion of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 was previously identified as an shell associated with the wolf - rayet star @xmath66 muscae @xcite .",
    "however , given the larger field of view in the current observations , this shell arc appears connected with the arc above the plane .",
    "the void of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 is bisected by emission from the galactic plane .",
    "because the rotation curve is dual - valued at these velocities , some emission is likely due to much more distant gas located on the far side of the tangent point . in the context of these measurements",
    "the @xmath66 muscae shell must be part of the larger structure that we identify as gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .",
    "@xcite also noted a second  depression at @xmath22  that we identify as part of gsh  304 - 00 - 12 .    there is 2.4  ghz continuum emission corresponding to the lower half of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .",
    "[ fig : coalsack2.4 ] is a 2.4 ghz continuum image from the @xcite survey of the southern galactic plane overlaid with contours of an  channel image of the shell at @xmath44  .",
    "the continuum emission excellently traces the inside edge of the shell below the plane .",
    "also , the continuum may trace a portion of the shell above the plane near @xmath67 , though this emission is very weak making a definitive detection difficult .",
    "there is an arc of continuum emission through the the upper  void that does not correspond to any  features .",
    "these arcs were identified by @xcite as a possible supernova remnant , g303.5 + 0 .",
    "however , close examination of iras 100  images of the region reveals a very faint infrared shell coincident with the radio continuum features .",
    "these features were also identified as an h@xmath4 shell , the coalsack loop , by @xcite .",
    "the detection of the arcs in the infrared implies that the emission is thermal and therefore suggests that the arcs are not part of a supernova remnant .",
    "the close morphological similarity of the lower arcs and the  shell leaves little doubt that the two are associated .",
    "we point out that the coalsack loop is much larger in angular size than the coalsack nebula so that even though the loop is behind the nebula , extinction in the nebula will not affect the h@xmath4 emission .",
    "we believe , therefore , that the continuum emission is the photo - ionized region interior to the  shell .",
    "the cen ob1 stellar association is centered at @xmath68 , @xmath69 with radial velocities in the range @xmath70  to @xmath71  .",
    "the adopted distance is 2.5  kpc @xcite , which puts the cluster , to within the errors , at the same distance as gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .",
    "the positions of the stars are plotted on a channel image of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 at @xmath72  in fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] .",
    "the morphology of the shell appears to trace the stellar distribution , suggesting an association .",
    "the shell extends further above the plane than below , a characteristic that is matched by the stellar distribution .",
    "the cluster contains 21 stars with measured luminosities and temperatures and calculated ages and masses @xcite .",
    "the earliest stars in the association are of type o9 , which suggests that more massive stars may have already exploded as supernovae .",
    "a wolf - rayet star , @xmath66 muscae , of spectral type wc6 is also in the cluster .",
    "this system is a binary , possibly a triple , consisting of the w - r+o close binary and a distant o supergiant @xcite .",
    "a priori , it seems likely that this association is the energy source for the gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .    to explore",
    "whether gsh  305 + 01 - 24 could be explained as a wind - driven bubble associated with cen ob1 , we employed a very simple one - dimensional numerical model to study the evolution of a shell powered by the stars in this association .",
    "the model follows standard equations for the evolution of a pressure - driven wind bubble ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the system is simplified to contain a centrally located power source , in this case the ob association , that supplies a time - dependent wind luminosity which drives the expansion of a shell .",
    "we assume that the internal pressure and temperature are constant throughout the bubble interior .",
    "the system is further simplified by assuming an ideal , monatomic gas equation of state , and a cool , homogeneous external medium .",
    "the bubble expansion can be described by three first - order equations : the rate of expansion of the shell , the equation of momentum conservation and the equation of energy conservation .",
    "the rate of expansion , @xmath73 , is simply the first - derivative of the shell radius , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and the momentum conservation equation , including the effects of external and internal pressure , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the mass of the shell and @xmath80 is the density of the ambient medium .",
    "the equation of energy conservation is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the wind luminosity and @xmath83 is the bubble volume , @xmath84 .",
    "the internal energy of the shell , @xmath85 is related to the internal pressure according to the relation @xmath86 where the adiabatic index is @xmath87 .",
    "the wind luminosity , @xmath88 , is calculated from an estimate of the mass - loss rate , @xmath89 , and escape velocity , @xmath90 , of each star in the cen ob1 association .",
    "the external pressure is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the local speed of sound in the external medium , which is assumed to be @xmath93  for a warm neutral medium at @xmath94 k. using temperatures , luminosities , masses , and ages for 21 cen ob1 stars tabulated by @xcite , we estimate the mass - loss rate from the empirically determined mass - loss rates of ob stars made by @xcite . the terminal velocity is estimated from the ob stellar wind model of @xcite . using the ages of the stars we calculate the total wind luminosity as the sum of all stars that exist at each time step .",
    "only stars for which masses , luminosities , and ages are available are included in the model . the spectral type , escape velocities , mass - loss rates , and wind luminosities are given in table  [ tab : stars ] .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a constant external density , @xmath95 , corresponding to one hydrogen atom per cubic centimeter . the model is calculated with time steps of @xmath96  yr and the initial conditions are calculated from the self - similar solutions to the differential equations at the first time step , @xmath97  yr .    the results of the numerical integration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "we explored two cases : one where the luminosity increases with time as stars are `` born '' in the association and another case of constant luminosity equal to the sum of all stars , regardless of age .",
    "the time - dependent wind luminosity case is plotted with a solid line and the constant wind luminosity case is plotted with a dashed line .",
    "the vertical dotted line marks the age of the oldest star in the association ( 14.7 myr ) , with time @xmath98 assumed to be the birth of that star .",
    "the expansion velocity flattens near 14 myr because of the high mass - loss rate of the wolf - rayet star , @xmath66 muscae .",
    "several differences between the two models are of note .",
    "first , the shell radius for the constant wind luminosity case can be fit as @xmath99 , the analytic self - similar solution to the problem .",
    "but , in the time - dependent wind luminosity case the radius goes as @xmath100 initially and then is better fit as @xmath101 .",
    "second , the usual assumption of coeval star formation for stellar associations leads to a slight over - estimate of the total energy input in a wind blown bubble .",
    "this effect is most noticeable as an overall increase in final shell radius by a factor of @xmath102 ; expansion velocity is relatively insensitive to the total energy input for larger ages .",
    "it seems , then , that including the stellar ages in the wind luminosity model results a marginally better fit to the data .",
    "we find that gsh  305 + 01 - 24 is surprisingly well described by the @xcite model of a wind - blown bubble with a time - dependent wind luminosity from cen ob1 stars .",
    "this model predicts a shell radius of @xmath103  pc , which corresponds well with the measured radii of @xmath104  pc ; whereas the time - independent luminosity model predicts a radius of @xmath105  pc .",
    "the model predicts an expansion velocity of @xmath106  for both the time independent and dependent luminosity cases , which also agrees well with an inferred expansion velocity of @xmath107  .",
    "the good agreement suggests that gsh  305 + 01 - 24 was indeed formed from the stellar winds of the cen ob1 association .",
    "the size and expansion velocity are consistent with a shell age approximately equal to the age of the oldest star in the association ( @xmath108  myr ) .",
    "@xcite , however , derive an age of @xmath109  myr for cen ob1 , from the average of the population s ages .",
    "the stellar ages are evenly distributed from 14.7 myr to 3.6 myr with no evidence for sequential star formation , but rather there is evidence for continuous star formation , which makes it difficult to define an age for the cluster . using the wind luminosities and ages of the cen ob1 association stars we find the total energy released in the form of stellar wind luminosity during the lifetime of the association is @xmath110 ergs .",
    "we can compare this to the expansion energy of the shell - the equivalent energy instantaneously deposited at the center of the shell - derived by @xcite and given in equation 2 of @xcite : @xmath111 . to account for the current radius and rate of expansion of gsh  305 + 01 - 24",
    ", the expansion energy is @xmath112 ergs , which agrees well with the total energy of the cen ob1 stellar winds .",
    "the model shows , as it was intended to do , that the origin of gsh 305 + 01 - 24 can be explained , with respect to the energetics , as stellar wind luminosity from the cen ob1 association . despite the good reproduction of the shell characteristics by this model , it should be stressed that it is a over - simplification and can not replace full magnetohydrodynamical simulations of  shells from ob associations .",
    "no attempts have been made to include multi - dimensional modeling , radiative cooling , magnetic fields , or the spatial distribution of the energy input sources .",
    "additionally , the model contains no morphological information that can be helpful when trying to fully understand shell dynamics .",
    "here we summarize some of the components of a non - idealized ism that have not been included in the calculations and how those might effect the results .",
    "the model neglects energy injection from supernovae because there is no direct evidence for any associated with this cluster .",
    "however , it is possible that there have been supernovae in the association .",
    "the effect of supernovae on the wind - driven bubble evolution is very similar to that of stellar winds as an input energy source @xcite .",
    "@xcite show in their equation 1 that for a standard initial mass function , an association of @xmath113 stars with mass greater than @xmath114 , supernovae input a mean luminosity over the association lifetime of @xmath115 .",
    "however , only @xmath116% is available in the first 10 myr .",
    "therefore , if @xmath117 , supernovae would have increased the modeled radius and expansion velocity of gsh 305 + 01 - 24 by about a factor of two .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stars ] the stars of the cen ob1 association are distributed throughout the interior of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .",
    "the model , however , assumes all stars are at the center of the shell .",
    "the b stars may have migrated as much as @xmath118 pc in the shell life - time @xcite , which suggests that the stars could have been initially distributed over a region @xmath119 pc in diameter .",
    "this inferred remaining distribution should be negligible on the calculated shell radius and expansion velocity , but could affect the morphology of the shell .",
    "the shell morphology would likely be dominated by external density variations that were not included in this model .",
    "as shown in studies of supershell expansion in stratified media ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shells expanding out of the plane of the galaxy experience exaggerated expansion and blow - outs in that direction . for gsh  305 + 01 - 24 , the shell radius is on the order of the scale height of the  disk , at which height the density gradient of the disk becomes significant .",
    "also , as noted above , the shells are at the edge of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm , so the density and pressure should decrease into the interarm region . both of these effects will undoubtedly lead to exaggerated expansion down both density gradients .",
    "small scale density fluctuations and the development of instabilities in the course of shell expansion can also effect the shell shape and size and can lead to break - outs in localized regions .",
    "the effect of such break - outs would be to equalize the internal and external pressures and stall expansion .",
    "finally , three dimensional simulations of shell expansion in multi - phased , magnetized , turbulent media show shells that are far from circular and exhibit many merging cavities and tunnels rather than a fully empty void @xcite .",
    "uniform magnetic fields in the disk can act to temporarily confine shells to the plane , and thereby affect the shell radius @xcite .",
    "clearly , the model employed here has numerous limitations , but it adequately shows that winds from the cen ob 1 association can account for the observed shell radius and expansion velocity .",
    "we have shown images of two new  shells , gsh  305 + 01 - 24 and gsh  304 + 00 - 12 , located at the edge of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm in the direction of the coalsack nebula .",
    "both shells are very large , with radii on the order of 200  pc .",
    "we employed a simple time dependent wind luminosity model based on the ages and luminosities of the stars in the cen ob1 association to describe the evolution of gsh  305 + 01 - 24 .",
    "the model predictions agree well with the observed shell radius and expansion velocity .",
    "we use this agreement , the positional coincidence of the shell and ob association , and the similarities between the shell morphology and the stellar distribution to argue that gsh  305 + 01 - 24 is a wind - blown bubble .",
    "this shell is associated with a 2.4  ghz radio , infrared and h@xmath4 shell that were previously posited to be an old supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "because of the infrared detection of the shell we believe that the emission is thermal and therefore not part of a supernova remnant , but instead emission from the shell itself .",
    "we also found a large angular diameter shell , gsh  304 - 00 - 12 , that does not appear to have formed from any known stellar associations .",
    "this shell is embedded in the edge of the sagittarius - carina arm and expanded into the interarm region , resulting in a conical geometry .",
