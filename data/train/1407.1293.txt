    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the quality of approximation of almost time and band limited functions by its expansion in the hermite basis . as a corollary ,",
    "this allows us to obtain the rate of convergence of the hermite expansion of function in the @xmath0-sobolev space with fixed compact support .",
    "time - limited functions and band - limited functions play a fundamental role in signal and image processing .",
    "the time - limiting assumption is natural as a signal can only be measured over a finite duration .",
    "the band - limiting assumption is natural as well due to channel capacity limitations .",
    "it is also essential to apply sampling theory .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest form of the uncertainty principle tells us that a signal can not be simultaneously time and band limited .",
    "a natural assumption is thus that a signal is almost time and band limited in the following sense :    let @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a function @xmath3 is said to be    * @xmath4-_almost time limited _ to @xmath5 $ ] if @xmath6 * @xmath7-_almost band limited _ to @xmath8 $ ] if @xmath9    here and throughout this paper the fourier transform is normalized so that , for @xmath10 , @xmath11(\\omega):=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{\\r}f(t)e^{-it\\omega}\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\\ ] ]    of course , given @xmath3 , for every @xmath2 there exist @xmath1 such that @xmath12 is @xmath4-almost time limited to @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath7-almost time limited to @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the point here is that we consider @xmath13 as fixed parameters .",
    "a typical example we have in mind is that @xmath14 and is time - limited to @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "such an hypothesis is common in tomography , _",
    "@xcite , where it is required in the proof of the convergence of the filtered back - projection algorithm for approximate inversion of the radon transform .",
    "but , if @xmath14 with @xmath15 , that is if @xmath16 then @xmath17 thus @xmath12 is @xmath18-almost band limited to @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "an alternative to the back projection algorithms in tomography are the algebraic reconstruction techniques ( that is variants of kaczmarz algorithm , _ see _ @xcite ) .",
    "for those algorithms to work well it is crucial to have a good representing system ( basis , frame ... ) of the functions that one wants to reconstruct .",
    "thanks to the seminal work of landau , pollak and slepian , the optimal orthogonal system for representing almost time and band limited functions is known .",
    "the system in questions consists of the so called prolate spheroidal wave functions @xmath19 and has many valuable properties ( see @xcite ) . among the most striking properties they have",
    "is that , if a function is almost time limited to @xmath5 $ ] and almost band limited to @xmath8 $ ] then it is well approximated by its projection on the first @xmath20 terms of the basis : @xmath21 this is a remarkable fact as this is exactly the heuristics given by shannon s sampling formula ( note that to make this heuristics clearer , the functions are usually almost time - limited to @xmath22 $ ] and this result is then known as the @xmath23-theorem , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a major difficulty with prolate spheroidal wave functions that has attracted a lot of interest recently , namely the difficulty to compute them as there is no inductive nor closed form formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one approach is to explicitly compute the coefficients of the prolate spheroidal wave functions in terms of a basis of orthogonal polynomials like the legendre polynomials or in the hermite basis .",
    "the question that then arises is that of directly approximating almost time and band limited functions by the ( truncation of ) their expansion in the hermite basis . this is the question we address here .",
    "we postpone the same question concerning legendre polynomials for which we use different methods .    an other motivation for",
    "this work comes from the work of the first author @xcite on uncertainty principles for orthonormal bases .",
    "there it is shown that an orthonormal basis @xmath24 of @xmath25 can not have uniform time - frequency localization .",
    "several ways of measuring localization were considered , and for most of them , the hermite functions provided the optimal behavior . however , in one case , the proof relied on : this shows that the set of functions that are @xmath4-time limited to @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath7-band limited to @xmath8 $ ] is almost of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , this set can not contain more than a fixed number of elements of an orthonormal sequence . as this proof shows , the optimal basis here consists of prolate spheroidal wave functions .",
    "as the hermite basis is optimal for many uncertainty principles , it is thus natural to ask how far it is from optimal in this case .",
    "let us now be more precise and describe the main results of the paper .",
    "recall that the hermite basis @xmath27 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath25 given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a normalization constant .",
    "recall also that the @xmath30 s are eigenfunction of the fourier transform .",
    "morover , as is well known the @xmath30 s satisfy a second order differential equation .",
    "this allows us to use the standard wkb method to approximate the hermite functions as follows : let @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then , for @xmath34 , @xmath35 this formula is not new ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , we will need a precise estimate of the error term , both in the @xmath36 sense for which we improve the one given in @xcite and the lipschitz bound .",
    "a first consequence of this formula is that the @xmath0-mass of @xmath37 is essentially concentrated in an annulus of radius @xmath38 and width @xmath39 of the time - frequency plane .",
    "a second consequence is the approximaion over @xmath5\\times[-t , t]$ ] of the kernel @xmath40 more precisely , by using and the christoffel - darboux formula , one gets for @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 be the hilbert - schmidt operator defined on @xmath44)$ ] by @xmath45 } r_n(x , y ) f(y)\\ , dy.\\ ] ] the heuristic is then as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath12 is @xmath46 time and band limited in @xmath5\\times[-\\omega,\\omega]$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath12 is only `` correlated '' to the first @xmath47 hermite functions : @xmath48 is small if @xmath49 .",
    "one may thus expect that @xmath50 where the error has a satisfactory decay rate with respect to @xmath51 this seems unfortunately not to be the case .",
    "we establish that for @xmath52 , the @xmath53 has an @xmath0-norm bounded by @xmath54 :    [ th : mainhermite ] let @xmath55 and @xmath2 .",
    "assume that @xmath56 for @xmath57 an integer , let @xmath58 be the orthogonal projection of @xmath12 on the span of @xmath59 .",

    "the above heuristics suggest that the right power of @xmath65 may should be closer to @xmath66 .",
    "we will show how one can decrease the dependence on @xmath65 by replacing the hermite basis by a scaled version @xmath67 at the expense of a worse dependence on the almost band - limitness of @xmath12 .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to the approximation of hermite functions by the wkb method .",
    "we then devote section [ sec : kernel ] and [ sec : kernel2 ] to establish properties of the kernel of the projection on the hermite functions . in section [ sec : mainth ] we first prove theorem [ th : mainhermite ] .",
    "then , we give the quality of approximation of almost time and band limited functions by the scaled hermite functions . finally , in the last section , we give various numerical examples that illustrate the different results of this work .",
