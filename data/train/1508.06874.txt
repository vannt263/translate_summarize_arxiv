    "bootstrap percolation was introduced by chalupa , leath and reich @xcite as a model for certain interacting particle systems in physics . since then it has found applications in clustering phenomena , sandpiles @xcite , and many other areas of statistical physics , as well as in neural networks @xcite and computer science @xcite .",
    "there are two broad classes of questions one can ask about bootstrap percolation .",
    "the first , and the most extensively studied , is what happens when the initial configuration @xmath26 is chosen randomly under some probability distribution ?",
    "for example , vertices are included in @xmath26 independently with some fixed probability @xmath32 .",
    "one would like to know how likely percolation is to occur , and if it does occur , how long it takes .",
    "the answer to the first of these questions is now well understood for various graphs .",
    "an interesting case is the one of the lattice graph @xmath33^d$ ] , in which @xmath34 is fixed and @xmath35 tends to infinity , since the probability of percolation under the @xmath19-neighbor model displays a sharp threshold between no percolation with high probability and percolation with high probability .",
    "the existence of thresholds in the strong sense just described first appeared in papers by holroyd , balogh , bollobs , duminil - copin and morris @xcite .",
    "sharp thresholds have also been proved for the hypercube ( balogh and bollobs @xcite , and balogh , bollobs and morris @xcite ) .",
    "there are also very recent results due to bollobs , holmgren , smith and uzzell @xcite , about the time percolation take on the discrete torus @xmath36 for a randomly chosen set @xmath26 .",
    "the second broad class of questions is the one of extremal questions .",
    "for example , what is the smallest or largest size of a percolating set with a given property ?",
    "the size of the smallest percolating set in the @xmath34-dimensional grid , @xmath33^d$ ] , was studied by pete and a summary can be found in @xcite .",
    "morris @xcite and riedl @xcite , studied the maximum size of minimal percolating sets on the square grid and the hypercube @xmath37 , respectively , answering a question posed by bollobs .",
    "however , it was proved in @xcite that finding the smallest percolating set is np - complete for general graphs .",
    "another type of question is : what is the minimum or maximum time that percolation can take , given that @xmath26 satisfies certain properties ?",
    "recently , przykucki @xcite determined the precise value of the maximum percolation time on the hypercube @xmath38}$ ] as a function of @xmath35 , and benevides and przykucki @xcite have similar results for the square grid , @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] , also answering a question posed by bollobs .    here",

    "thus , since @xmath48 is not satisfiable , then there is a vertex @xmath103 such that @xmath20 infects @xmath56 at time @xmath108 .",

    "this assignment satisfies @xmath48 because since @xmath20 has at least one vertex in each set @xmath107 , then each clause will have at least one literal that evaluates to true . furthermore , since all vertices in @xmath78 are infected at time 4 , then we have that two vertices in @xmath111 that represent the same variable but negate each other , can not be in @xmath20 simultaneously and , therefore , we do not risk to assign different values to the same variable .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath79 is infected by @xmath20 at time @xmath112 .",
    "since any hull set @xmath20 infects all vertices in @xmath113 at time @xmath112 , then @xmath55 is the only vertex that can possible be infected at time greater than 4 . since , for any hull set @xmath20 , @xmath20 infects @xmath55 at time @xmath112 , hence all hull sets infect @xmath1 at time @xmath112 .",

    "the proof remains the same .",
    "in the next sections , we prove that the percolation time problem for @xmath45 in general graphs and for @xmath45 and @xmath5 for bipartite graphs is polynomial time solvable . in each of these cases ,",
    "we obtain algorithms that are by - product of a structural characterization that can be computed in polynomial time .",
