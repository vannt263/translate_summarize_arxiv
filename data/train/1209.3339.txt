    "the milky way galaxy is known to be surrounded by a halo of dark matter whose composition remains a mystery .",
    "only 5% of the universe consists of ordinary atomic matter , while the remainder is 23% dark matter and 72% dark energy @xcite .",
    "identifying the nature of this dark matter is the longest outstanding problem in all of modern physics , stemming back to observations in 1933 by fritz zwicky ; he proposed the existence of `` dunkle materie '' ( german for `` dark matter '' ) as a source of gravitational potential to explain rapid motions of galaxies in the coma cluster  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , others discovered flat rotation curves in disk galaxies , starting with babcock in 1939  @xcite and followed ( more persuasively and with better data ) by rubin and ford  @xcite and roberts and whitehurst  @xcite in the 1970s .",
    "their results imply that the predominant constituent of mass inside galaxies must be nonluminous matter ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a leading candidate for this dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the terminology refers to the fact that these particles undergo weak interactions in addition to feeling the effects of gravity , but do not participate in electromagnetic or strong interactions .",
    "wimps are electrically neutral and the average number of interactions with the human body is at most one per minute , even with billions passing through every second  @xcite . the expected wimp mass ranges from 1  gev to 10  tev . these particles , if present in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , annihilate with one another so that a predictable number of them remain today .",
    "the relic density of these particles is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fractional contribution of wimps to the energy density of the universe .",
    "an annihilation cross section @xmath2 of weak interaction strength automatically gives the right answer , near the value measured by wmap @xcite .",
    "this coincidence is known as the `` wimp miracle '' and is why wimps are taken so seriously as dark matter candidates .",
    "possibly the best wimp candidate is motivated by supersymmetry ( susy ) : the lightest neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions  @xcite .",
    "however , other wimp candidates arise in a variety of theories beyond the standard model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "a multitude of experimental efforts are currently underway to detect wimps , with some claiming hints of detection .",
    "there is a three - pronged approach : particle accelerator , indirect detection ( astrophysical ) , and direct detection experiments .",
    "the focus of this review article is the third option  direct detection experiments .",
    "this field began thirty years ago with the work of drukier and stodolsky @xcite , who proposed searching for weakly interacting particles ( with a focus on neutrinos ) by observing the nuclear recoil caused by their weak interactions with nuclei in detectors .",
    "then , goodman and witten @xcite made the important point that this approach could be used to search not just for neutrinos but also for wimps , again via their weak interactions with detectors .",
    "soon after , drukier , freese , and spergel @xcite extended this work by taking into account the halo distribution of wimps in the milky way , as well as proposing the annual modulation that is the subject of this review .",
    "the basic goal of direct detection experiments is to measure the energy deposited when wimps interact with nuclei in a detector , causing those nuclei to recoil .",
    "the experiments , which are typically located far underground to reduce background contamination , are sensitive to wimps that stream through the earth and interact with nuclei in the detector target .",
    "the recoiling nucleus can deposit energy in the form of ionization , heat , and/or light that is subsequently detected . in the mid 1980s ,",
    "the development of ultra - pure germanium detectors provided the first limits on wimps @xcite . since then , numerous",
    "collaborations worldwide have been ( or will be ) searching for these particles , including anais @xcite , ardm @xcite , cdex / texono @xcite , cdms @xcite , cogent @xcite , coupp @xcite , cresst @xcite , dama / nai @xcite , dama / libra @xcite , deap / clean @xcite , dm - ice @xcite , drift @xcite , edelweiss @xcite , eureca @xcite , kims @xcite , lux @xcite , naiad @xcite , pandax @xcite , picasso @xcite , rosebud @xcite , simple @xcite , texono @xcite , warp @xcite , xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite , xenon1 t @xcite , xmass @xcite , zeplin @xcite , and many others .",
    "the count rate in direct detection experiments experiences an annual modulation @xcite due to the motion of the earth around the sun ( see figure  [ fig : earth ] ) . because the relative velocity of the detector with respect to the wimps depends on the time of year , the count rate exhibits ( in most cases ) a sinusoidal dependence with time . for the simplest assumptions about the dark matter distribution in the halo ,",
    "the flux is maximal in june and minimal in december .",
    "annual modulation is a powerful signature for dark matter because most background signals , _",
    "e.g. _  from radioactivity in the surroundings , are not expected to exhibit this kind of time dependence .",
    "the details concerning the recoil energy and modulation spectra depend on the specifics of both the particle physics model and the distribution of wimps in the galaxy .",
    "we discuss these possibilities in this review .    for more than a decade , the dama experiment @xcite has been claiming detection of an annual modulation .",
    "the experiment , which consists of nai crystals , is situated in the gran sasso tunnel under the apennine mountains near rome . by now",
    ", the amount of data collected is enormous and the statistical significance of the result is undeniable . the dama annual modulation is currently reported as almost a 9@xmath3 effect @xcite , and is consistent with an @xmath480 or 10  gev  @xcite wimp elastically scattering predominantly off of iodine or sodium , respectively .",
    "many other direct detection experiments have presented null results that are in clear conflict with the high - mass window .",
    "the viability of the 10  gev wimp remains a controversial issue because it is not clearly compatible nor clearly incompatible with other null experiments once various detector systematics are taken into account .",
    "recently , the cogent experiment reported a 2.8@xmath3 evidence for an annual modulation  @xcite and a third experiment , cresst - ii , has also announced anomalous results  @xcite . whether dama , cogent , and cresst are consistent in the low - mass window",
    "is still debated  @xcite .",
    "yet cdms sees no annual modulation  @xcite , and both cdms @xcite and xenon  @xcite find null results that appear to be in conflict with the three experiments that report anomalies .",
    "the current experimental situation in direct detection searches is exciting . understanding the anomalies and the role that different experiments play in validating them is of crucial importance in moving forward in the search for dark matter . in this review article , we seek to provide the reader with the basic theoretical tools necessary to understand a potential dark matter signature at a direct detection experiment , focusing on the annual modulation of the signal .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : dmdetection ] by reviewing the basics of direct detection techniques for wimps , describing the particle physics in section  [ sec : crosssection ] and the astrophysics in section  [ sec : velocitydist ] .",
    "we describe the standard halo model ( shm ) as well as modifications due to substructures . in section  [ sec :",
    "modulation ] , we examine the behavior of the annual modulation signals for both the shm and substructures .",
    "although this is primarily a theoretical review , we turn to the experimental status in section  [ sec : experiments ] , briefly reviewing the current anomalies and null results .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the appendices discuss quantities required for understanding results of direct detection experiments .",
    "appendix  [ sec : quench ] describes the quenching factor , and appendix  [ sec : miv ] presents analytical results for the mean inverse speed for commonly used wimp velocity distributions , a quantity necessary for a computation of expected count rates in detectors .",
    "direct detection experiments aim to observe the recoil of a nucleus in a collision with a dark matter particle  @xcite .",
    "after an elastic collision with a wimp @xmath5 of mass @xmath6 , a nucleus of mass @xmath7 recoils with energy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleus system , @xmath10 is the speed of the wimp relative to the nucleus , and @xmath11 is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame .",
    "the differential recoil rate per unit detector mass is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number density of wimps , with @xmath14 the local dark matter mass density ; @xmath15 is the time - dependent wimp velocity distribution ; and @xmath16 is the velocity - dependent differential cross - section , with @xmath17 the momentum exchange in the scatter . the differential rate is typically given in units of cpdkg@xmath18kev@xmath18 , where cpd is counts per day .",

    "here , @xmath24 is the mass splitting between the lightest and next - to - lightest states in the spectrum in the case of an inelastic scattering interaction;(100  kev ) was first invoked to reconcile the dama anomaly with the cdms limits  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , alternate formulations remain viable as a means of reconciling the experimental results ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . more generally , inelastic scattering ( for arbitrary @xmath24 ) remains an interesting possibility for direct detection experiments , yielding distinct recoil spectra .",

    "the dominant wimp - quark couplings in direct detection experiments are the scalar and axial - vector couplings , which respectively give rise to spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross - sections  @xcite . in both cases , @xmath26 to leading order ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for how higher order corrections can modify this form ) . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the heaviside step function , @xmath28 is the maximum momentum transfer in a collision at a relative velocity @xmath10 , and the requirement @xmath29 gives rise to the lower limit @xmath30 in the integral for @xmath31 in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : eta ] ) . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath32 is the scattering cross - section in the zero - momentum - transfer limit  we shall use @xmath33 and @xmath34 to represent this term in the si and sd cases , respectively  and",
    "@xmath35 is a form factor to account for the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "the wimp coherently scatters off the entire nucleus when the momentum transfer is small , giving @xmath36 .",
    "however , as the de  broglie wavelength of the momentum transfer becomes comparable to the size of the nucleus , the wimp becomes sensitive to the spatial structure of the nucleus and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 at higher momentum transfers .",
    "it is traditional to define a form - factor corrected cross - section @xmath39 as was used in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : drdenr2 ] ) above .",
    "we note that this is an _ effective _ cross - section , whereas the _ actual _ scattering cross - section is given by @xmath40 for a given relative velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the total wimp - nucleus scattering rate is then the sum over both the si and sd contributions , each with its own value of the form factor .",
    "we describe these two cross - sections below and then briefly discuss more general operators .",

    "are roughly comparable , @xmath48 . for identical couplings ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the si cross - section can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the wimp - proton reduced mass .",
    "as neutralinos are the currently favored wimp candidate , this assumption is widely made throughout the direct detection literature .",
    "although typically @xmath47 , models can be constructed that violate this condition ( _ e.g. _ , isospin - violating dark matter @xcite ) .",
    "we assume identical si couplings for the rest of this review .",
    "the si cross - section grows rapidly with nuclear mass .",
    "the explicit @xmath52 factor in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : sigmasi2 ] ) arises from the fact that the contributions to the total si cross - section of a nucleus is a coherent sum over the individual protons and neutrons within .",
    "in addition , for wimps that are much heavier than the nucleus , @xmath53 , so the cross - section scales as @xmath54 . however , the form factor suppression becomes more significant as the size of the nucleus increases , so the scattering rate does not scale as @xmath54 for heavy nuclei , though it still rises rapidly with @xmath55 . as a result ,",
    "direct detection experiments often use heavy nuclei to increase their sensitivity to wimp scattering .",
    "the si form factor is essentially a fourier transform of the mass distribution of the nucleus .",
    "a reasonably accurate approximation is the helm form factor @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57  fm and @xmath58 is an effective nuclear radius with @xmath59  fm and @xmath60  fm .",
    "further details on si form factors can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "sd scattering is due to the interaction of a wimp with the spin of the nucleus through operators such as @xmath61 , and takes place only in those detector isotopes with an unpaired proton and/or unpaired neutron .",
    "the sd wimp - nucleus cross - section is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fermi constant , @xmath64 is the spin of the nucleus , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the average spin contributions from the proton and neutron groups , respectively , and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) are the effective couplings to the proton ( neutron ) . unlike the si case , the two sd couplings @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath68 may differ substantially ( though they are often of similar order of magnitude ) , so that a simplification comparable to eqn .  ( [ eqn : sigmasi2 ] ) for si scattering is not made in the sd case .",
    "because of the uncertain theoretical relation between the two couplings and following from the fact that one of @xmath66 or @xmath67 is often much smaller than the other , experiments typically only significantly constrain one of the two sd cross - sections , @xmath70 or @xmath71 , but not both .",
    "sd scattering is often of lesser significance than si scattering in direct detection experiments for two main reasons .",
    "first , si scattering has a coherence factor @xmath52 that the sd scattering is missing .",
    "in fact , the spin factors @xmath64 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are either zero or @xmath72 , so the sd cross - section does not grow as rapidly with nucleus size as the si cross - section does . thus , whereas @xmath73 for heavy wimps , @xmath74 ( _ n.b._this remaining @xmath52 factor arises from @xmath75 ) .",
    "second , spin - zero isotopes do not contribute to sd scattering , so the sd scattering is reduced in elements where non - zero - spin nuclei represent only a small fraction of the naturally occurring isotopes within a detector s target mass .",
    "we note that sd couplings may often be larger than si couplings ; _",
    "e.g. _ , for an mssm neutralino , it is often the case that @xmath76 .",
    "however , even with this ratio of couplings , si scattering is still expected to dominate for the heavy elements used in most detectors for the two reasons described above .",
    "the sd form factor depends on the spin structure of a nucleus and is thus different between individual elements .",
    "form factors for many isotopes of interest to direct detection experiments , as well as estimates of the spin factors @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can be found in the reviews of refs .",
    "@xcite .      while scalar and axial - vector couplings are the dominant interactions for many wimp candidates , such as neutralinos , they are by no means the only allowed couplings . in general , dark matter - nucleon interactions can be described by a non - relativistic effective theory , as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory approach is useful for highlighting the variety of operator interactions that can exist , and their potentially unique direct detection signatures .",
    "generic operators can give rise to additional factors of the velocity and/or momentum in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : dsigmadq ] ) . due to the small velocities ( @xmath77 ) and momenta transfers ,",
    "these interactions are expected to be suppressed relative to the scalar and axial - vector cases and are thus often ignored . however , in models where the scalar and axial - vector couplings are forbidden or suppressed themselves , these new types of interactions can become important .",
    "consider momentum - dependent ( md ) interactions .",
    "for certain classes of theories  @xcite , the dominant interactions yield a scattering rate of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an arbitrary mass scale and @xmath80 si , sd denotes whether the rate is independent of nuclear spin or not ; @xmath81 is the conventional si or sd scattering rate described previously .",

    "the momentum dependence in the rate has an important effect on the recoil spectrum , suppressing scattering at low energies .",
    "this leads to a peaked recoil spectrum and potentially more high - energy events than would be expected for the case of standard elastic scattering with no momentum dependence , where the rate falls off exponentially .",

    "thus , an experimental determination of the recoil energy at which the phase reverses , which occurs at @xmath186  km / s for the shm , can constrain the wimp mass . for a germanium detector ,",

    "as the wimp gets much heavier than the target nucleus , the recoil spectrum becomes degenerate and the energy of the phase reversal approaches a fixed value ( 62  kev for germanium ) ; observation of a reversal at this energy allows only a lower limit to be placed on the wimp mass .",
    "we emphasize that detection of this phase reversal could constitute an important signature of a wimp flux , as backgrounds would not give rise to such an effect .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the shm may not be an accurate model of the smooth background halo .",
    "however , the generic features of the shm modulation signal discussed here are also features to be expected of any smooth background halo model .",
    "in particular , the modulation should be sinusoidal in shape with a phase around the beginning of june , have an @xmath183 modulation amplitude ( except at high @xmath146 ) , and have a phase reversal  @xcite .",
    "however , all these features can be significantly altered if there is any significant substructure present in the halo , so we turn to substructure next .",
    "next , we consider the modulation spectrum when the dark matter scattering in the detector is dominated by unvirialized components in the halo , such as debris flows or streams .",
    "the schematic in figure  [ fig : schematic ] illustrates how the modulated and total rates in these cases can differ drastically from that expected from a smooth halo contribution . for a complete discussion of the modulation spectra for dark matter streams , see ref .",
    "a simple analytic approximation for the mean inverse speed of the debris flow is given in  @xcite , from which it is straightforward to derive the modulated and total rates ( see also appendix  [ sec : miv ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] emphasizes that substructure components can increase the number of expected scattering events at large recoil energies , in comparison to the smooth halo contribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that velocity substructure is most likely to be found near the escape velocity , where the dark matter is predominantly not in equilibrium . in particular , while the modulation amplitude for a smooth halo falls with energy , that for debris flows and streams can peak at large values .",
    "therefore , a larger - than - expected modulation at high recoil energies can be an important indicator for dark matter substructure in the local neighborhood .    as an example of a substructure component",
    ", we now consider the case of a dark matter stream more fully .",
    "for the case of a dispersionless dark matter stream , the recoil spectrum is proportional to @xmath187 where @xmath11 is the heaviside function , and is flat up to the cutoff energy @xmath188 this characteristic energy is the maximum recoil energy that can be imparted to the nucleus , and is obtained as follows : the maximum momentum transferred from a wimp to a nucleus occurs when the nucleus recoils straight back and is @xmath189 .",

    "the dark matter in a tidal stream can be expected to have a velocity dispersion of a similar magnitude , though how closely it matches the dispersion of the stars remains an open question .",
    "we take as an example a stream with velocity and direction similar to what may be expected if the sgr stream is accompanied by a broader stream of dark matter that passes near the solar neighborhood  @xcite .",
    "this is intended as a concrete example of a more general phenomena , and will illustrate the basic features of an annual modulation signal in the presence of a stream .",
    "the stream in our example is roughly orthogonal to the galactic plane and moves at a speed @xmath4350  km / s relative to the sun .",
    "its speed distribution and mean inverse speed @xmath31 are shown in figure  [ fig : eta ] ; in the latter case , the step - like spectrum ( with a softened edge ) is evident .",
    "for this stream , @xmath135 is maximal on december  29 and minimal on june  30 .",
    "there are two distinct features of a stream s recoil spectrum that modulate : ( 1 ) the height of the step and ( 2 ) the location of the step edge .",
    "unlike the shm , the relative modulation amplitude is fairly uniform at all @xmath146 below the velocity of the stream in the lab frame , though , like the shm , the modulation is small compared to the total rate .",
    "this modulation , seen in the top panel of figure  [ fig : modulation ] , is sinusoidal and peaks in late december . above the stream s velocity in the lab frame ,",
    "the signal vanishes because there are no available dark matter particles ( lower panel of figure  [ fig : modulation ] ) .",
    "the modulation becomes interesting when the minimum scattering velocity is approximately equal to the stream s velocity in the lab frame , @xmath192  350  km / s .",
    "this occurs near the edge of the step in the recoil spectrum .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : schematic ] , @xmath31 changes by a relatively large amount throughout the year for @xmath193 , leading to a very large modulation .",
    "the modulation at the softened edge of the example stream , shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : modulation ] , has a relative amplitude of nearly 70% , far larger than that for the shm . though not apparent in this figure , this is one of the special cases where the higher order terms of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fourier ] ) can become important and the modulation deviates from a sinusoidal shape ; see figure  7 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a clearer example .",
    "this very large modulation , which occurs only over a narrow range of recoil energies , has a phase reversed from that at lower energies .",
    "the features of the modulation for our example stream are expected of any cold flow ( stream ) . up to some cutoff energy , the modulation is uniform , relatively small , and sinusoidal . above the cutoff energy ,",
    "the modulation , as well as the total rate , is negligible . over a narrow range of energies about the cutoff energy",
    ", the modulation can be very large and possibly non - sinusoidal .",
    "however , the phase of the modulation and cutoff energy can vary significantly depending on the direction and speed of the stream .",
    "observation of unexpected phases in the modulation and/or a narrow energy range containing an unusual modulation behavior would not only indicate that a significant stream of dark matter is passing through the local neighborhood , but would allow the direction and/or speed of that stream to be determined",
    ". however , there may be more than one significant stream or other substructure  in addition to the smooth halo background ",
    "so more than one halo component may make significant contributions to the recoil spectrum and modulation signals , complicating the interpretation of modulation data .",
    "we turn to a multiple component halo next .",
    "thus far , we have considered the modulation spectra of individual components of the dark matter halo separately . however , in greater likelihood , the local dark matter will be comprised of a combination of virialized and unvirialized components . in such cases , low - velocity dark matter will most likely be in equilibrium and well - described by a smooth halo , while the high - velocity tail of the distribution may have additional contributions from streams or debris flows .",
    "the resulting modulation spectrum will be a linear combination of the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : schematic ] , appropriately weighted by the relative density of each component .",
    "a general study of dark matter detection in the presence of arbitrary streams or debris flow , in combination with a smooth halo background , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the addition of even a small amount of substructure to the smooth halo background can significantly alter the observational signals in direct detection experiments from those due to the background distribution alone .",
    "we take , for example , the case of the shm with the addition of our example ( sgr - motivated ) stream at a density 10% that of the shm .",
    "while the overall recoil spectrum is approximately exponentially falling due to the large contribution from the shm , a noticeable drop - off in the spectrum appears around a characteristic energy @xmath194 corresponding to the step in the stream contribution .",
    "the impact on the modulation , shown in figure  [ fig : modulation ] , is even more pronounced .",
    "as can be seen in the middle panel , the shape can differ significantly from that due to either contribution alone : the modulation is no longer sinusoidal and is not even symmetric in time .",
    "the phase also differs significantly : the peak of the modulation occurs at a time several months different from that of either component . from the different panels , it is also clear that the phase changes with recoil energy by more than just a 180@xmath195 phase flip .    in the general case where multiple components contribute significantly to the scattering , the following features in the modulation spectrum can arise :    *",
    "the phase of modulation can vary strongly with recoil energy and not just by a 180@xmath195 phase reversal ; * the combined modulation may not be sinusoidal , even if the modulation of each individual component is ; * the combined modulation may not be time - symmetric , even if the modulation of each individual component is ; and * the minimum and maximum recoil rates do not necessarily occur 0.5  years apart .",
    "more quantitatively , the time - dependence of the rate is no longer dominated by the @xmath160 term in the fourier expansion of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : fourier ] ) , and other terms in the expansion contribute .",
    "a power spectrum of the modulation is very useful for understanding the relative strengths of these higher - order contributions ( see _ e.g._ref .",
    "the dama experiment is currently the only one with enough data to have produced a power spectrum of their results ; their measured limit on @xmath196 can already provide constraints on certain types of streams , as has been shown for the case of inelastic dark matter in ref .",
    "in this section , we discuss the experimental status of dark matter annual modulation searches . an extremely diverse set of direct detection experiments exists , which take advantage of a variety of target materials and background rejection techniques .",
    "the advantage of such diversity is that different targets are more or less sensitive to different types of dark matter and/or features in the velocity profile .",
    "for example , searches for spin - dependent interactions require the use of targets with non - zero spin . also , a lighter target , such as germanium or sodium versus xenon , is better for detecting light mass dark matter .",
    "the current anomalies from dama , cogent , and cresst have engendered a great deal of excitement in the field , with debates as to whether they represent the first direct observation of dark matter .",
    "we now review these experiments , as well as their counterparts that report the tightest constraints .",

    "however , the modulation could be explained by local substructure  @xcite .",
    "the cdms experiment also consists of germanium and is located in the soudan mine . using the ratio of two signals observed in an interaction with the detector target  phonons and ionization",
    " cdms can distinguish between nuclear recoil events ( wimp and/or neutron interactions ) and electron recoil events ( beta and gamma interactions ) , where the latter represents an otherwise dominant background contribution  @xcite .",
    "the conventional low - background analyses in cdms , the most recent having 612  kg - days of exposure  @xcite , have failed to detect any excess events inconsistent with background .    to improve sensitivity to light wimps , which produce only low energy recoils , cdms has also performed a low - energy analysis @xcite , reducing its threshold from 10  kev to 2  kev . at these lower energies ,",
    "it is more difficult to discriminate between potential signal events and background events , so there is far more background contamination in this analysis than the conventional case .",
    "the @xmath4500 low - energy events found in this analysis are consistent with rough background estimates . however , cdms places conservative no - background - subtraction constraints on light wimps , neglecting background contributions and allowing any or all of the events to be due to wimps .",
    "cdms has also performed a modulation search in their low - energy data @xcite , finding no evidence for modulation .",
    "constraints on the modulation amplitude , assuming the cogent best - fit phase of april  16 , are shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "a direct comparison can be made with the cogent modulation results because both experiments have a germanium target , although the cdms modulation analysis was only performed down to 5  kev , whereas the cogent modulation data goes to a much lower @xmath42  kev .",
    "the cresst experiment , developed at the max planck institute in munich and deployed in the gran sasso tunnel , has 730  kg - days of data with a cawo@xmath201 scintillating crystal target , and measures both light and heat to reject electron recoils .",
    "it reports an excess of low energy events with a statistical significance of over 4@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the experiment is not background - free however , and has experienced problems with energetic alpha and lead ions produced in the decay of polonium , itself produced from radon decay .",
    "for various technical reasons not discussed here , polonium deposited in the clamps holding the detectors in place is the major source of such backgrounds .",
    "the expected number of these events , which occur on the surface , is determined by extrapolating from high energy observations ( where such background events are readily identifiable ) to the signal regions at lower energies using monte carlo simulations .",
    "questions have been raised as to whether the monte carlo simulations underestimate the background contamination by failing to account for the roughness of the surface at microscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "an upcoming redesign should eliminate this background source , and future cresst runs should clarify the origin of the current excess .      the xenon collaboration has developed a series of liquid xenon target experiments , with the most recent iteration ( xenon100 ) containing @xmath4100  kg of xenon @xcite . as with cdms and cresst ,",
    "xenon uses two signals  scintillation and ionization in this case  to discriminate between nuclear recoils and electron recoils . xenon100 and xenon10 both performed conventional low - background analyses  @xcite .",
    "in addition , xenon10 published a low - energy analysis that sacrifices background discrimination to improve sensitivity to light wimp masses  @xcite .",
    "none of these analyses find an excess of events above expected background and xenon100 currently places the most stringent constraints on the si cross - section for wimps heavier than @xmath410  gev .",
    "the experiments we discussed in detail here represent only a fraction of the current direct detection program .",
    "no other experiment claims an excess of events consistent with dark matter and , for standard assumptions , none provide constraints as stringent as those from cdms and xenon100 .",
    "one exception is the case of sd scattering where the coupling to the neutron is suppressed relative to the proton ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "the proton - even target materials in cdms and xenon only couple weakly to the wimp in this case ( see eqn .  ( [ eqn : sigmasd ] ) ) , so these experiments place relatively weak constraints .",
    "for this case , coupp @xcite , picasso @xcite , and simple @xcite provide the best limits .",
    "figure  [ fig : msigma ] summarizes the current status of anomalies and limits for si scattering , assuming the shm with @xmath203  km / s and @xmath204  km / s .",
    "note that the experimental limits and anomalies , as shown in this figure , are highly dependent on the assumptions made about the particle and astrophysics ( see  @xcite for astrophysics - independent comparisons ) . the compatibility may change for _ e.g. _  a different wimp - nucleus effective operator or for additional substructure contributions  @xcite",
    ". however , note that changes to the particle physics and/or astrophysics may change the interpretation of individual results without actually affecting the compatibility among different results .",
    "in addition , various systematic issues regarding the behavior of individual detectors , such as the calibration of the recoil energy scale , can impact the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the high - mass @xmath191(80  gev ) dama region appears to be ruled out for both si and sd elastic scattering by null results from cdms , xenon , and coupp  a heavy mass wimp is only viable for non - standard interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the compatibility of light @xmath191(10  gev ) dark matter remains the subject of some debate . for the case of si scattering , these positive results are in apparent contradiction with each other and with cdms and xenon .",
    "some authors have nevertheless argued that some of the results could potentially be reconciled ( see _ e.g. _  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "for the case of sd scattering , the dama lower mass region has until recently remained compatible with all experiments @xcite , provided the sd coupling to the neutron is strongly suppressed relative to the proton ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "results from picasso have since closed this window for standard assumptions @xcite .",
    "this particular case is also uniquely suited to be probed by indirect searches involving detection of neutrinos produced by wimps annihilating in the sun , _",
    "e.g. _  with the super - kamiokande @xcite and icecube detectors @xcite .",
    "direct detection experiments are poised at an important juncture . in the past few years",
    ", the cross - sections reached by the detectors have improved by roughly two orders of magnitude .",
    "a similar improvement is expected in the next generation of detectors , which will be one tonne ( 1000  kg ) in size .",
    "these experiments will probe some of the most promising regions of wimp parameter space , exploring higgs exchange cross - sections and large regions of supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "however , as the sensitivity of direct detection experiments reaches @xmath206  @xmath207 , astrophysical neutrinos become an irreducible background , so the experiments are no longer zero - background  @xcite .",
    "in addition to tonne - size detectors pushing the reach to lower cross sections and heavier dark matter masses , efforts are also being made to explore dark matter with masses below @xmath41  gev using electron recoils  @xcite .    new technology and creative experimental designs will allow for further exploration of the @xmath208 dark matter anomalies .",
    "for example , kims  @xcite and anais  @xcite , which use csi(tl ) and nai(tl ) targets , respectively , will test the dama modulation claim .",
    "@xcite is a detector located at the south pole that also uses the same target material as dama .",
    "because it is located in the southern hemisphere and is embedded deep in the ice where the natural temperature variation is minimal , dm - ice should have different environmental background sources than dama .",
    "in addition , directional detectors will provide a powerful probe in mapping out the distribution of the local dark matter . whereas the modulation in the recoil rate discussed throughout this paper resulted from the variation in the _ velocity _ of the detector relative to the dark matter halo ( due to the earth orbiting the sun and , to a much lesser extent , the rotation of the earth ) ,",
    "detectors with recoil direction sensitivity will observe a diurnal modulation in the recoil direction due to the _ rotation _ of the detector as the earth spins ( _ i.e. _  the orientation of the detector with respect to the halo changes throughout the day ) .",
    "the incoming wimp flux is peaked in the direction of the sun s motion and , as a result , the nuclear recoil angular spectrum is peaked in the opposite direction for most energies .",
    "therefore , the event rate should experience a strong forward - backward ( ` head - tail ' ) asymmetry along the direction of the disk rotation .",
    "in addition , the direction of the dark matter wind as observed in the lab frame changes with the time of day due to the earth s daily rotation . the result is a differential recoil rate at a particular angle ( as measured in the lab frame ) that diurnally modulates with an amplitude as large as @xmath4100%  @xcite , far larger than the modulation effects that are the focus of this paper . ref .",
    "@xcite reviews the current status of prototypes of directional detection experiments . to achieve reasonable angular resolution ,",
    "the recoiling nucleus must leave a track that is sufficiently long . as a result , the chosen detector material is a gas , typically cf@xmath201 and cs@xmath209 in current designs .",
    "the use of gas as the active target , with the gas being at low pressure ( well below atmospheric pressure to allow for longer recoil tracks ) , will require these detectors to have volumes of @xmath210 to achieve tonne - scale masses .",
    "a novel type of directional detector has also recently been proposed that uses a dna tracking material @xcite .",
    "these detectors can achieve nanometer resolution with an energy threshold of 0.5 kev and can operate at room temperature .",
    "when a wimp from the galactic halo elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector , the recoiling nucleus then traverses thousands of strings of single stranded dna ( ssdna ) and severs those ssdna strings it hits .",
    "the location of the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of cut ssdna using techniques well known to biologists .",
    "thus , the path of the recoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy . by leveraging advances in molecular biology ,",
    "the goal is to achieve about 1,000-fold better spatial resolution than in conventional wimp detectors at a reasonable cost .",
    "directional detectors are particularly useful in mapping out the local dark matter distribution  @xcite . a positive signal at both a direct and directional detection experiment would provide complementary information about the halo , building our understanding of the velocity structure of the local dark matter .",
    "the theoretical and experimental status of the annual modulation of a dark matter signal ( due to earth s rotation around the sun ) in direct detection experiments has been reviewed here .",
    "annual modulation provides an important method of discriminating a signal from most backgrounds , which do not experience such a yearly variation .",
    "the milky way halo consists of a dominant smooth component as well as substructures such as streams , tidal debris , and/or a dark disk , each of which contributes to the modulation of the signal . in the standard halo model",
    ", the count rate in experiments should peak in june with a minimum in december ; substructure may change the phase , shape , and amplitude of the modulation .",
    "the current experimental situation is puzzling , as several experiments have positive signals ( dama and cogent both see annual modulation , while cogent and cresst - ii have unexplained events ) but appear to be contradicted by null results from other experiments ( cdms and xenon ) . in the future , detectors with sensitivity to the directionality of wimps should enable determination of the direction of the wimp wind as well as diurnal modulation due to earth s rotation .",
    "proposed techniques for directional detection include large gaseous detectors as well as nanometer tracking with dna .",
    "consistent measurement of a head / tail asymmetry together with annual modulation would provide very convincing evidence of wimp detection .",
    "the future of dark matter searches is promising and an annual modulation signal should play an important role in the interpretation and confirmation of a potential wimp signal .",

    "any experimental apparatus does not directly measure the recoil energy of scattering events . the recoiling nucleus ( or recoiling electron , in the case of some backgrounds ) will transfer its energy to either electrons , which may be observed as _ e.g. _",
    "ionization or scintillation in the detector , or to other nuclei , producing phonons and heat ; these are the signatures that are measured .",
    "some experiments that measure only scintillation or ionization give their results in terms of the electron - equivalent energy @xmath198 of an event in their detector ( usually given in units of kevee ) .",
    "this quantity is defined as the energy of an electron recoil that would produce the observed amount of scintillation or ionization , even if the event was actually a nuclear recoil rather than an electron recoil .",
    "nuclear recoils tend to produce a smaller amount of scintillation / ionization than electron recoils for the same recoil energy , so @xmath198 is _ not _ the recoil energy of that event if it is a nuclear recoil event . for nuclear recoils",
    ", these two energies are related by @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is called the quenching factor .",
    "the quenching factor is different for each element in a detector and can have a recoil - energy dependence . the different quenching factors for different elements and for electron - recoil events ( @xmath213 for electron recoils , by definition ) makes it impossible to determine the recoil energy of an event based upon the scintillation or ionization signal alone .",
    "take , for example , the nai in dama , with @xmath214 and @xmath215 @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for quenching factor measurements of nai and several other scintillators used in direct detection experiments ) .",
    "a recoil event in dama that produces 2  kevee of scintillation can be from a @xmath47  kev na recoil , a @xmath422  kev i recoil , or a 2  kev electron recoil .",
    "dama is unable to distinguish between these three types of events on an event - by - event basis , so any dama analysis is necessarily based upon the total @xmath216 spectrum that contains contributions from all three types of events .",
    "cogent , which observes only ionization in a germanium target , also gives results in terms of the electron - equivalent energy spectrum .",
    "cogent suggests using @xmath217 as a reasonable approximation to the quenching factor measurements over the energy range of interest @xcite ( measurements of @xmath212 in germanium can be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "cdms , which also uses a germanium target , can discriminate between electron - recoil and nuclear - recoil events and can reconstruct the nuclear recoil ( though limited by a finite resolution ) , so results for this experiment are given in terms of @xmath218 rather than @xmath198 . because cdms and cogent are made of the same target material",
    ", one would expect that these two experiments should have the same nuclear recoil spectrum ; however , one should keep in mind the caveat that the two results are given in terms of different quantities that must be rescaled to make direct comparisons between their two results .",
    "the detection rate in dark matter experiments is directly proportional to the mean inverse speed @xmath219 . here , we present analytical results of this integration quantity for several commonly used isotropic velocity distributions .",
    "we define @xmath220 as the velocity distribution in the rest frame of the dark matter population ( _ i.e._@xmath221 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution in the lab frame is determined via the galilean transformation @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the ( time - dependent ) motion of the lab ( observer ) relative to the rest frame of the dark matter population .",
    "this motion is described in more detail in section  [ sec : modulation ] .",
    "the distributions considered below are maxwellian distributions ( including two modifications to account for a finite cutoff ) and distributions corresponding to cold flows and debris flows .",
    "these are not the only possible distributions of dark matter and may be only simple approximations for some populations , but they are frequently used distributions that have known analytical forms for @xmath31 .      perhaps the most useful simple distribution is the maxwellian : @xmath224 for this distribution , @xmath225 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath226 is the most probable speed , @xmath227 many well - mixed populations of dark matter particles can be expected to have a maxwellian or maxwellian - like distribution , in which case the above is a useful first approximation .",
    "the standard halo model ( shm ) takes the dark matter halo to be an isothermal sphere , in which case the velocity distribution is maxwellian .",
