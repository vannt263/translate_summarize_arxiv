    "quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) schr \" odinger equations occupy an intermediate place between exactly - solvable and non - solvable ones . such equations , which have widespread applications in physics , chemistry , and engineering , are characterized by the fact that a ( finite ) part of their spectrum can be determined algebraically if the potential parameters satisfy certain constraints , while the remaining part remains unknown . among the procedures used to construct them ,",
    "one may quote the recursion relation method , which is rather hard to perform since one has to deal with three- or more - step recursion relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two easier approaches are the one based on an sl(2,@xmath0 ) algebraization @xcite and that relying on the functional bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example of qes systems is the sextic polynomial oscillator @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the non - qes nature of the simpler and phenomenologically more important quartic polynomial oscillator @xcite has always been surprising . in a recent work inspired by the well - known example of the square",
    "well , znojil proposed a resolution of this paradox by allowing an analyticity - violating symmetrization of the quartic polynomial oscillator and he proved that the resulting potential is qes by using the recursion relation approach @xcite .",
    "this has emphasized the interest of splitting the real line of coordinates into subintervals and considering potentials that admit different definitions inside these subintervals , while remaining continuous on the whole real line @xcite .",
    "such a procedure indeed opens the possibility of constructing new es or qes potentials .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold : first to re - examine the symmetrized quartic polynomial oscillator in the light of the sl(2,@xmath0 ) lie algebraic method , and second to propose a new symmetrized sextic one , while providing some explicit solutions of both of them .",
    "as in @xcite , let us consider the symmetrized quartic polynomial oscillator @xmath1 which is non - analytic and defined separately on the two semi - infinite intervals @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "here @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are three real constants . the corresponding schr \" odinger equation @xmath7 may be considered separately on these two intervals .",
    "physically acceptable wavefunctions should tend to zero at infinity and be continuous everywhere , as well as their first derivative .",
    "since the potential is symmetric under parity , they must also be either symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "we may therefore solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) in one of the intervals , e.g. , @xmath2 , then impose that in the other interval @xmath3 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 or @xmath10 according to whether @xmath11 is even or odd .",
    "qes solutions of ( [ eq : se ] ) may be obtained by assuming that @xmath12 takes the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 here @xmath15 , @xmath16 are two real constants , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , 1 ,  , @xmath19 ) are some expansion coefficients to be determined .",
    "such functions have the right behaviour for @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", the continuity of @xmath21 and of its derivative at the origin imposes the additional condition @xmath22    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : qes-4 ] ) in ( [ eq : se ] ) and setting @xmath23 in order to eliminate some high - order terms , we arrive at the differential equation @xmath24 on the interval @xmath2 .",
    "this is a ( triconfluent ) heun equation @xcite .",
    "hence , provided we also set @xmath25 the second - order differential operator @xmath26 on its left - hand side can be written as a second - degree polynomial @xcite @xmath27 in the sl(2,@xmath0 ) generators @xmath28 acting in the ( @xmath29)-dimensional representation in the space of polynomials of order not higher than @xmath19 , @xmath30 .",
    "on using the relations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , it is straightforward to explicitly write the matrix of @xmath26 in the space @xmath34 .",
    "its diagonalization , followed by the imposition of constraint ( [ eq : constraint-4 ] ) , will then provide the admissible energies @xmath35 and wavefunctions @xmath21 .    in @xcite",
    ", znojil solved the rather complicated @xmath36 , @xmath37 case by the recursion relation method . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we plan to exhibit some simpler examples , which can be directly derived by using ( [ eq : heun])([eq : j ] ) .    for @xmath38",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 and @xmath40 on @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath41 and @xmath42 , according to ( [ eq : constraint-4 ] ) , the resulting wavefunction on the whole real line can not be odd , but it can be even if the condition @xmath43 is satisfied .",
    "we conclude that the potential @xmath44 has an energy eigenvalue @xmath45 and associated wavefunction @xmath46 , given by @xmath47 corresponding to a ground state .",
    "turning now ourselves to the @xmath48 case , we arrive at a second - degree equation for @xmath49 , whose solutions @xmath50 are real provided @xmath51 , which imposes @xmath52 or @xmath53 and either @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions on @xmath2 are @xmath56 . hence @xmath57 and @xmath58 . on the whole line",
