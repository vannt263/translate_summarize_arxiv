    "direct cp - violation within the standard model takes place when two or more amplitudes with different ckm phases interfere in a time - independent manner . as an example , take the decay of a @xmath2 meson to a final state @xmath3 , which can proceed through two amplitudes .",
    "the partial decay widths can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the magnitudes of the interfering amplitudes , @xmath7 is the ckm phase difference between the amplitudes , and @xmath8 is the cp - conserving phase difference .",
    "cp - violation is often considered in terms of a non - vanishing cp - asymmetry , @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath11 gives a determination of @xmath0 which has a 4-fold ambiguity , due to its invariance under the two symmetry operations @xmath12 these ambiguities were also noted in methods which do not rely on a decay rate asymmetry  @xcite .    the @xmath13 ambiguity is generally considered unphysical , since application of @xmath13 to @xmath0 values within the currently allowed range  @xcite , @xmath14 yields values which are not within @xmath15 , and are therefore inconsistent with the standard model .",
    "we note , however , a third symmetry of equation  ( [ eq : interf ] , which makes the ambiguity 8-fold : @xmath16 this symmetry has so far been overlooked , perhaps because it does not appear to be a symmetry of @xmath11    the significance of @xmath17 arises from the fact that while @xmath17 and @xmath13 may be unphysical within the standard model , the operation @xmath18 , applied to @xmath19 , results in values which are in or close to @xmath15 .",
    "thus , given the finite sensitivity of future experiments , it may be impossible to deem @xmath20 unphysical , hampering the ability to test the standard model using such measurements of @xmath0 .    in some @xmath0 measurement methods",
    ", there is no a - priori knowledge of the magnitudes of some of the interfering amplitudes .",
    "these magnitudes are then obtained simultaneously wth @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", additional `` accidental '' ambiguities will exist if more than one magnitude value is consistent with the data .",
    "an example is given below .",
    "@xmath1 decays , recently observed by cleo  @xcite , provide several ways to measure the weak phase @xmath21 . since non - standard model effects are expected to be small in such decays , comparing these measurements with experiments which are more sensitive to new physics may be used to test the standard model  @xcite .",
    "gronau and wyler ( gw )  @xcite have proposed to measure @xmath0 in the interference between the @xmath22 decay @xmath23 and the color - suppressed , @xmath24 decay @xmath25 .",
    "interference occurs when the @xmath26 is observed as one of the cp - eigenstates @xmath27 , which are identified by their decay products .",
    "the interference amplitude is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a cp - conserving phase .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is extracted from this triangle relation and its cp - conjugate , disregarding direct cp - violation in @xmath30  decays  @xcite .",
    "several variations of the method have been developed@xcite .    in practice",
    ", measuring the branching fraction @xmath31 requires that the @xmath30 be identified in a hadronic final state , @xmath32 , since full reconstruction is impossible in semileptonic decays , resulting in unacceptably high background .",
    "atwood , dunietz and soni ( ads )  @xcite pointed out that the decay chain @xmath25 , @xmath33 results in the same final state as @xmath23 , @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 undergoes doubly cabibbo suppressed decay . estimating the ratio between the interfering decay chains , one obtains @xmath36 the numerical value in equation  ( [ eq : gw - trouble ] ) was obtained using @xmath37  @xcite , @xmath38 , @xmath39  @xcite , and @xmath40 which is the ratio measured for @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : gw - trouble ] ) implies that sizable interference makes it practically impossible to measure @xmath31 , and the gw  method fails .",
    "ads proposed to use the interference of equation  ( [ eq : gw - trouble ] ) to obtain @xmath0 from the decay rate asymmetries in @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are two @xmath26 final states of the type @xmath44 . measuring the four branching fractions , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ,",
    "one calculates the four unknowns @xmath47 , @xmath0 , and the two cp - conserving phases associated with the two decay modes . @xmath48 and",
    "the @xmath30 decay branching fractions will have already been measured to high precision by the time the rare decays @xmath49 are observed .",
    "in addition to the similar magnitudes of the interfering amplitudes , large cp - conserving phases are known to occur in @xmath26  decays  @xcite , making large decay rate asymmetries possible in this method .",
    "jang and ko ( jk )  @xcite and gronau and rosner  @xcite have developed a @xmath0 measurement method similar to the gw method , but in which @xmath50 is not measured directly .",
    "rather , it is essentially inferred by using the larger branching fractions of the decays @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , solving in principle the problem presented by equation  ( [ eq : gw - trouble ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath54 amplitude in @xmath1 is very small and hard to detect , several methods will have to be combined in order to make best use of the limited data .",
    "quantitative estimates of the resulting gain in sensitivity are rarely conducted , since they require realistic efficiency and background estimates , and depend on specific phase values . here",
    "we undertake this task for the case of combining the ads and gw methods ( contributions of the jk method are commented on later ) . in this scheme ,",
    "one obtains the unknown parameters @xmath55 where @xmath56 $ ] , by minimizing the function @xmath57 with respect to the parameters @xmath58 . in equation  ( [ eq : chi2 ] )",
    "we use the symbols @xmath59 to denote the experimentally measured decay rates of interest , and @xmath60 to denote the corresponding theoretical quantities .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the cp - conjugates of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "@xmath69 represents the experimental error in the measurement of the quantity @xmath70 .",
    "several gains over the individual methods are immediately apparent : in the ads  method , a @xmath26 decay mode is `` wasted '' on measuring the uninteresting cp - conserving phases . by contrast , when combining the methods , knowledge of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in a single mode is in principle enough to determine the four unknowns , @xmath58 , even if @xmath71 . in practice , adding the @xmath72 modes will decrease the statistical error of the measurement . in both the gw and the ads methods , the ability to resolve the @xmath73 ambiguity depends on the degree to which @xmath29 varies from one @xmath2 decay mode to the other . experimental limits on cp - conserving phases in @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77  @xcite suggest that @xmath29 may be small , making the @xmath73 resolution difficult . when combining the methods , however , we note that @xmath68 and @xmath64 are invariant under @xmath78 , whereas @xmath67 and @xmath63 are invariant under @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath73 ambiguity is thus resolved in a single @xmath2 and @xmath26 decay mode in which @xmath80 is far enough from 0 or @xmath81 .",
    "we proceed to estimate the sensitivity of the @xmath0 measurement combining the ads and gw methods , at a future , symmetric @xmath82 @xmath83-factory , operating at the @xmath84(4s ) resonance .",
    "the detector configuration is taken to be similar to that of cleo - iii@xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity is @xmath85 , corresponding to three years of running at the full luminosity of @xmath86  @xmath87  s@xmath88@xcite with an effective duty factor of 20% .",
    "crucial to evaluating the measurement sensitivity is a reasonably realistic estimate of the background rate in the measurement of @xmath65 , whose statistical error dominates the @xmath0 measurement error , @xmath89 .",
    "we estimated the background by applying reconstruction criteria to monte carlo events generated using the full , geant - based@xcite cleo - ii detector simulation . the event sample consisted of about @xmath90 @xmath91 events and @xmath92 continuum @xmath93 events , where @xmath94 stands for a non-@xmath95 quark . since the full simulation did not include a silicon vertex detector or cerenkov particle identification system , these systems were simulated using simple gaussian smearing .",
    "the cerenkov detector was taken to cover the polar region @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath30 candidates ( reference to the charge conjugate modes is implied ) were reconstructed in the final states @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . the @xmath100 and @xmath30 candidate invariant masses were required to be within @xmath101 standard deviations ( @xmath102 ) of their nominal values .",
    "a dalitz plot cut was applied in the @xmath103 mode to suppress combinatoric background .",
    "the @xmath2 candidate energy was required to be within @xmath104 of the beam energy .",
    "the beam - constrained mass , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the beam energy and @xmath107 is the momentum of the @xmath2 candidate , was required to be within @xmath104 of the nominal @xmath2 mass . since the @xmath108 and the @xmath30 fly back - to - back , all charged daughters of the @xmath2 candidate were required to be consistent with originating from the same vertex point .",
    "continuum background was suppressed by applying cuts on the cosine of the angle between the the sphericity axis of the @xmath2 candidate and that of the rest of the event , and on the output of a fischer discriminant  @xcite . in background events ,",
    "the reconstructed @xmath108 and @xmath109 come from two different @xmath26  mesons , or are due to @xmath110 popping , while signal events often contain a third kaon , originating from the other @xmath83 meson in the event . as a result",
    ", 90% of the background events are rejected by requiring that an additional @xmath109 or @xmath111 be found in the event and be inconsistent with originating from the @xmath2 candidate vertex .    with the above event selection criteria",
    ", we find that continuum events account for over 80% of the remaining background , with a rate of 7 events per @xmath112 charged @xmath83 mesons produced .",
    "this is comparable to the expected signal yield . under such low signal ,",
    "high background conditions , significant improvement is obtained by conducting a multi - variable maximum likelihood fit . in this technique ,",
    "cuts on the continuous variables are greatly loosened , and the separation of signal from background is achieved by use of a probability density function , which describes the distribution of the data in these variables . as has been the case in several cleo analyses of rare @xmath83 decays , we assume that the effective background level in the likelihood analysis , @xmath83 , as inferred from the signal statistical error , @xmath113 , will be similar to the level obtained with the monte carlo simulation .",
    "signal efficiency will increase , however , due to the looser selection criteria .",
    "the expected number of @xmath114 signal events is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of @xmath2  mesons produced , and @xmath117 is the probability that the final state be detected and pass the loosened selection criteria of the likelihood analysis . for given values of @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath0 , we calculate @xmath67 using the @xmath118 branching fractions from  @xcite , equation  ( [ eq : dcs ] ) , @xmath119  @xcite , and @xmath120 ( obtained from @xmath121 and the values used in equation  ( [ eq : gw - trouble ] ) ) .    to estimate the efficiency @xmath117 , we start with the values in  @xcite , 44% for the @xmath122 mode , 17% for the @xmath123 mode , and 22% for the @xmath124 mode . these are multiplied by the efficiency of finding the third kaon ( 45% ) , and the particle - id efficiency ( 68% ) .",
    "the particle - id efficiency is composed of the probability that a well - reconstructed @xmath108 be in the particle - id system s fiducial region ( 83% ) , and that half the @xmath109 daughters of the @xmath26 meson also be in the fiducial region .",
    "the momentum of the other half allows good identification using specific ionization , as does the momentum of the third kaon in most events .",
    "an additional efficiency loss of 10% is assumed due to non - gaussian tails , cerenkov ring overlaps , etc .",
    "the final efficiencies are 13% for the @xmath122 mode , 5% for the @xmath123 mode , and 7% for the @xmath124 mode .    since @xmath125 , suppression and accurate knowledge of the background in the measurement of @xmath66 is much less critical .",
    "starting from the continuum background level in  @xcite and applying vertex and particle - id criteria , we arrive at a rate of 60 background events per @xmath112 charged @xmath83 mesons .",
    "the number of signal events observed in this channel is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the efficiency for detecting the @xmath108 with the particle - id criteria described above , and @xmath128 are cp - eigenstate decay products of @xmath129 . using table  [ tab : cp - modes ] , we obtain @xmath130 .",
    "to estimate the measurement sensitivity for given values of the `` true '' parameters @xmath131 , we compute the average numbers of observed signal events using equations  ( [ eq : n_a ] ) and  ( [ eq : n_b ] ) . an integrated luminosity of @xmath132 yields @xmath133 .",
    "we assume that statistics will effectively triple if , in addition to @xmath25 , one uses the modes @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we therefore take @xmath139 .",
    "the resulting @xmath140 , @xmath141 and their cp - conjugates determine the experimental quantities @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the average experiment , ie . , the experiment in which statistical fluctuations vanish .",
    "the minimization package minuit  @xcite is then used to find the parameters @xmath58 , for which @xmath142 is minimal in this experiment .",
    "since the measurement is expected to be statistics - limited , only statistical errors are used to evaluate @xmath142 .    to demonstrate ambiguities ,",
    "the trial value of @xmath0 is stepped between @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath50 are varied by minuit so as to minimize @xmath142 .",
    "such @xmath0 scans are shown in figure  [ fig : gamma - scans ] for cases of particular interest .",
    "evident from these scans is the fact that a large @xmath147 at the input value @xmath148 does not guarantee that @xmath142 will obtain large values before dipping into a nearby ambiguity point . as a result ,",
    "the quantity that meaningfully represents the measurement sensitivity is not @xmath149 , but @xmath150 , the fraction of @xmath15 which is excluded by the @xmath1 measurement , ie .",
    ", for which @xmath151",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath150 , the greater the a - priori likelihood that predictions of @xmath0 based on new physics - sensitive experiments will be inconsistent with the @xmath1 measurement , leading to the detection of new physics .    to evaluate @xmath150 ,",
    "540 monte carlo experiments were generated , using randomly selected input values in the range @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( note that in reality , the cp - conserving phases will be different in the different decay modes ) .",
    "depending on the input phases , the numbers of observed signal events varied between @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "for each set of phases , a @xmath0 scan was conducted in the range @xmath19 , and @xmath150 was taken to be the fraction of the area of the scan for which @xmath151 .    the @xmath150 distribution of the 540 random experiments is shown in figure  [ fig : f_exc ] .",
    "also shown is the distribution of the 91 experiments for which @xmath157 .",
    "@xmath150 tends to be larger in this case , since small values of @xmath142 associated with the @xmath73 ambiguity ( even if the ambiguity is resolved ) are pushed away from the center of @xmath15 . since the distributions of phases used in the monte carlo experiments can not be expected to represent the actual phases in nature , it is not meaningful to study the @xmath150 distribution in detail .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig : f_exc ] indicates that this measurement may reduce the allowed region of @xmath0 by as much as 70% .",
    "we have studied in detail the measurement of @xmath0 using @xmath1 at a symmetric @xmath83  factory .",
    "use of this measurement to detect new physics effects is complicated by low statistics and an ambiguity which is at least 8-fold , not 4-fold as often stated .",
    "we show that combining the ads and gw methods helps resolve the @xmath158 ambiguity and decreases the statistical error , compared with the ads method alone .",
    "the ambiguities associated with the @xmath159 and @xmath17 symmetries are irremovable in measurements of this kind .",
    "even when the @xmath73 ambiguity is in principle resolved , in practice it still deteriorates the measurement by reducing @xmath142 ( or other experimental quantity of significance ) .",
    "being ambiguity - dominated , the sensitivity of future experiments should be evaluated in terms of the exclusion fraction @xmath150 , rather than the weak phase error @xmath149 . with a luminosity of @xmath132",
    ", we find that the @xmath1 measurement can exclude up to about @xmath160 of the currently - allowed range of @xmath0 .    with @xmath161 @xmath83  mesons , 100% efficiency and no background ,",
    "jk find @xmath149 in their method to be between about @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath164 .",
    "using more realistic estimates and noting out comments above , one would conclude that combining their method with the ads and gw methods , while probably useful for the actual experiment , will not result in a dramatic change in the predictions of our analysis .",
    "i am grateful to my colleagues at the cleo collaboration for permitting the use of the excellent monte carlo sample which they have worked hard to tune and produce ; to david asner and jeff gronberg for sharing their knowledge of the performance of the cleo silicon vertex detector ; and to michael gronau and yuval grossman for discussions and useful suggestions .",
