    "as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is built on the nonabelian su(3)-color group , it allows for purely gluonic bound states called glueballs .",
    "the structure and properties of these pure glue states is nowadays far from being completely understood and deserves much interest on both experimental and theoretical sides .    on the one hand ,",
    "some experimental glueball candidates are currently known .",
    "most of them are scalar , such as the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,  but no definitive conclusions can be drawn concerning the nature of these states .",
    "indeed , it is often pointed out that the lightest glueballs are probably strongly mixed with other hadrons like mesons and tetraquarks for example .",
    "many details concerning the identification of experimental states can be found in the recent report  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", pure gauge qcd has been investigated by lattice qcd for many years , leading to a well established glueball spectrum below 4  gev @xcite .",
    "numerous effective qcd models have also been applied to study the glueballs .",
    "one can quote qcd sum rules  @xcite , ads / qcd correspondence  @xcite , coulomb gauge qcd  @xcite , and potential models .",
    "pioneering works in this last field were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in both works ,",
    "glueballs are seen as bound states of at least two valence gluons , but the properties of these gluons ( mass and spin ) are very different . in the first reference ,",
    "valence gluons are assumed to be helicity-1 particles .",
    "it means that their spin has only two projections ( @xmath5 ) . in the second one",
    "however , they are seen as massive particles with spin-1 ( the zero projection is also allowed )",
    ".    a remark should here be done concerning the number of constituent gluons in a given glueball .",
    "it appears in lattice qcd that the lowest - lying glueballs are the @xmath6 ones . as a bound state of two gluons",
    "can only have @xmath6 , it is rather natural to assume that the lightest glueballs are mainly two - gluon states ( the more constituent gluons are present , the more the glueball should be heavy ) .",
    "this picture , that we adopt in the present work , is widely accepted in models with constituent gluons .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to mention some results of the coulomb gauge study of ref .  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a fock space expansion of glueball states in terms of quasigluons can be performed , and it appears that the influence of the three- and four - gluon components on the low - lying @xmath6 glueballs is negligible : the two - gluon component is dominant as intuitively expected .",
    "but actually , the relevance of using a potential model to describe a glueball is still controversial .",
    "let us begin by the problem of the gluon mass .",
    "as we already mentioned , there are works , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , arguing that a valence gluon is a massless particle , which gains a constituent mass @xmath7 , either constant  @xcite , or state - dependent @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "relativistic spin - dependent corrections are then developed in powers of @xmath9 . in this picture",
    ", the valence gluon is _ a posteriori _ massive , because it is confined into a glueball .",
    "let us note that , more generally , both quarks and gluons can gain a constituent mass from renormalization theory ( in the coulomb gauge approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , massless gluons gain a constituent mass of about @xmath10  gev at zero momentum ) .",
    "but , other studies keep the assumptions of ref .",
    "@xcite and state that a valence gluon has to be _ a priori _ considered as massive , that is with a non zero current mass @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is roughly that the nonperturbative effects of qcd cause a mass term to appear in the gluon propagator .",
    "this fixed gluon mass is typically assumed to be around @xmath11  gev @xcite , and the relativistic corrections are then expanded in powers of @xmath12 .",
    "the problem of the gluon spin is obviously linked to its mass .",
    "if a valence gluon is a priori massive , then it is a spin-1 particle .",
    "but , if it is massless , what is the correct internal degree of freedom ?",
    "the most obvious answer is that it has a helicity-1 .",
    "but , the spin corrections in potential models appear at the order @xmath9 , at a level where the gluons have a dynamical mass , and thus perhaps a spin-1 . in the present work",
    ", we will only focus on the case where the valence gluons are massless , that is have a vanishing current mass .",
    "we thus need a formalism which allows us to deal with both helicity and spin degrees of freedom , and to build quantum states with the correct symmetry following the degree of freedom which is chosen .    in potential approaches ,",
    "hadrons are generally described by @xmath13 quantum states ( in spectroscopic notation ) which are simultaneously eigenstates of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 is the total spin .",
    "but actually , @xmath18 is the only relevant angular momentum labeling a hadronic state ( together with the parity and the charge conjugation ) . in this picture",
    ", it is assumed that a @xmath0 state is a linear combination of the allowed @xmath13 states leading to the desired value of the total spin .",
    "how to build such a general state ?",
    "we propose here to use the helicity formalism , developed by jacob and wick in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe scattering in two - body systems .",
    "the crucial feature of this very general formalism is that it remains valid for massless particles like gluons .",
    "but , as we will show through this paper , it provides a powerful tool to build @xmath0 states in terms of the usual @xmath13 states , and allows to gain considerable insight on the glueball models in potential approaches .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ genform ] is a presentation of the helicity formalism .",
    "it sums up the key points of ref .",
    "then , in sec",
    ".  [ hsglu ] , this formalism , which allows for the gluons to have either a helicity or a spin degree of freedom , is applied to two - gluon glueballs .",
    "the case of massless gluons has already been studied in ref .",
    "we present here a more detailed study with a proper treatment of the relativistic kinematics , and we formulate the glueball helicity states in a way that is more convenient to further apply to potential models .",
    "moreover , the glueball spectrum is now far better known than at the time of ref .",
    "@xcite thanks to lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "that is why it is of interest to reconsider the description of glueballs with helicity states .",
    "to this aim , we introduce in sec .",
    "[ pmodel ] a simple potential model based on a spinless salpeter hamiltonian with a cornell potential .",
    "instanton - induced forces are also included .",
    "then , we show in sec .",
    "[ numapp ] that the model we introduced , supplemented by the helicity state formalism for helicity-1 gluons , leads to a rather good agreement with the lattice qcd spectrum .",

    "( [ hstate ] ) are orthonormalized by definition , i.e. @xmath46 , and they describe a general two - particle system in the rest frame .",
    "the use of helicity degrees of freedom rather than the spin ones allows to deal with massless particles too",
    ". this feature will obviously be useful in the description of glueballs .",
    "let us note that we did not write explicitly the dependence in @xmath47 of the helicity states in order to simplify the notation .",
    "the states  ( [ hstate ] ) are defined so that they satisfy @xmath48 moreover , the usual rules concerning the coupling of two angular momenta lead to the constraint @xmath49 it can also be shown that the @xmath50 states have the following behavior under the parity @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the intrinsic parity of particle @xmath54 .",
    "a physical state is asked not only to be an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators but also of the parity .",
    "such a requirement is fulfilled by the following linear combinations @xmath55 for which @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . in the latter",
    ", the @xmath58 and @xmath59 states will be referred as helicity states .",
    "when the two particles are identical ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) , it is relevant to study the action of the permutation operator @xmath62 .",

    "it is worth noting that the shape of the radial wave function can only depend on the total angular momentum @xmath70 in order not to destroy the symmetry properties of the helicity states . at this stage",
    ", one could wonder if the helicity formalism , which has been proposed as a powerful way of studying relativistic scattering problems , can be applied to describe bound states .",
    "actually , the construction of the helicity states that was presented here is purely geometrical .",
    "the angular parts of the states are built in order to have the desired properties , but the radial part of each state is arbitrary ( excepted that it can only depend on @xmath70 ) .",
    "consequently , only the dynamics of the system will fix this radial part : spherical waves will be obtained for scattering states , and bound state radial wave functions otherwise .",
    "but , the construction we presented up to now , being hamiltonian - independent , is valid in both cases .",
    "we now particularize the formalism to the special case of a system made of two gluons with helicity-1 .",

    "the total color wave function is indeed assumed to be a singlet one , which is totally symmetric , and does not explicitly appear in the computations .",
    "taking into account the symmetrization of the helicity sates , one finds that there are four allowed helicity states , namely @xmath85    but , the selection rules  ( [ selecgen ] ) together with eqs .",
    "( [ jinf ] ) and ( [ pdef ] ) impose particular values for the total angular momentum and parity of these four states .",
    "it can be checked that one can only obtain the following states @xmath86 the @xmath73- and @xmath44-labels stand for helicity - singlet and -doublet respectively .",
    "it should be noticed that a state made of two gluons in a color singlet has always a positive charge conjugation ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "more explicitly , the states  ( [ ggstate ] ) thus give rise to the following glueball states    [ ggstate3 ] @xmath88    it is readily observed that only the @xmath89 states can lead to @xmath90 , while the @xmath91 states always have @xmath92 .",
    "obviously , no @xmath93 state is present : only the @xmath94 states can generate an odd-@xmath70 , but @xmath70 is at least 3 in this case .",
    "the fact that a state made of two photons ( or gluons ) can never have the value @xmath93 is known as yang s theorem  @xcite , but has also been found independently by landau  @xcite .",

    "we have shown that this helicity formalism only leads to the quantum numbers which are observed in lattice qcd .",
    "this feature is a considerable improvement of usual potential models in which lots of extra glueball states are obtained . in particular , the well - known absence of @xmath93 states",
    "has been shown to be a consequence of the symmetrization in the helicity formalism for helicity-1 gluons .",
    "@xmath93 states are however allowed for spin-1 gluons .",
    "we have then developed a simple potential model , relying on a spinless salpeter hamiltonian with a cornell potential and massless gluons .",

    "two possibilities were taken into account : either the valence gluons are spin-1 or helicity-1 particles .",
    "we have computed the masses of different states by using standard values for the string tension and the strong coupling constant .",
    "the instanton parameter has been fitted so that it leads to an optimal agreement with lattice qcd data in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels .",
    "it appears that , if gluons are spin-1 particles , no instanton - induced term is needed in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels , but the rest of the spectrum is not in agreement with lattice qcd . if helicity-1 gluons are assumed , an instanton term has to be added since the @xmath101 glueballs would be nondegenerate otherwise .",

    "qcd , it appears that modeling the currently known @xmath6 glueballs by a bound state of two massless valence gluons with helicity-1 seems to be far more relevant , justifying _ a posteriori _ the assumption that two - gluon states dominate in this sector . in particular , the necessity of adding instanton - induced forces should not be seen as a flaw of the model , but rather as a way to be more coherent with other studies showing that instantons contribute in glueballs .    in conclusion",
    ", the helicity formalism appears to be a very promising way to improve potential models of hadrons containing valence gluons , because it takes into account correctly the relativistic character of these particles .",
    "it is relevant to assume that such valence gluons are massless particles with helicity-1 , as we argued in this paper . for what concerns the glueball mass spectrum ,",
    "it is remarkable how the addition of the helicity formalism to a simple potential model as the one we developed here leads to such a nice agreement with lattice qcd . in future works",

    "<S> in the last decade , lattice qcd has been able to compute the low - lying glueball spectrum with accuracy . like other effective approaches of qcd , potential models still have difficulties to cope with gluonic hadrons . assuming that glueballs are bound states of valence gluons with zero current mass , it is readily understood that the use of a potential model , intrinsically non covariant , could be problematic in this case . </S>",
    "<S> the main challenge for this kind of model is actually to find a way to introduce properly the more relevant degree of freedom of the gluon : spin or helicity . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use the so - called helicity formalism of jacob and wick to describe two - gluon glueballs . </S>",
    "<S> we show in particular that this helicity formalism exactly reproduces the @xmath0 numbers which are observed in lattice qcd when the constituent gluons have a helicity-1 , without introducing extra states as it is the case in most of the potential models . </S>",
    "<S> these extra states appear when gluons are seen as spin-1 particles . using a simple spinless salpeter model with cornell potential within the helicity formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a glueball mass spectrum which is in good agreement with lattice qcd predictions for helicity-1 gluons provided instanton - induced interactions are taken into account . </S>"
