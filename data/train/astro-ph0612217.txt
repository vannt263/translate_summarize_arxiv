    "they cross the classical instability strip , in which large - amplitude radial oscillations are driven by the @xmath3-mechanism , and the objects will be recognized as type ii cepheids and rv  tauri type pulsating variables . because of their fast evolution , these stars are rare and not many have been identified in the galaxy ( van winckel 2003 ) .",
    "the use of pulsations to determine the physical parameters of post - agb stars has been very limited so far .",
    "classical post - agb variables , like ( longer period ) type ii cepheids and rv  tauri stars , have an extensive literature and are understood to be low - order radial pulsators ( for a review , see wallerstein 2002 ) . some rv  tau stars , the so - called rvb variables , also show long - term changes that are attributed to binarity . although the macho database yielded important results on these objects ( alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) , the full use of microlensing data of post - agb stars is yet to be explored .",
    "the situation is much worse for post - agb pulsators outside the cepheid instability strip .",
    "theoretical models have suggested that complex , possibly chaotic , pulsations should occur in stars hotter than the instability strip ( aikawa 1991 , 1993 ; gautschy 1993 ; zalewski 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , irregular pulsations were found in several cases ( fokin et al .",
    "2001 ; le coroller et al .",
    "2003 ) , but a comprehensive survey of many objects , using a homogeneous set of long - term observational data , has rarely been done so far ( e.g. pollard et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "this group of stars not only offer the possibility of measuring physical parameters via modelling oscillations , but they also offer the best opportunity to observe stellar evolution over human time - scales . because these stars evolve quickly across the hrd , changes of their pulsation periods may be a sensitive indicator of the ongoing evolution , as in the extreme example of fg  sagittae ( jurcsik 1993 ) .",
    "de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) recently analysed broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) characteristics of a sample of post - agb objects to investigate the presence of keplerian rotating passive discs .",
    "the sample contained 51 stars , including confirmed binary post - agb stars collected from the literature , classical rv  tauri stars from the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs , kholopov et al .",
    "1985 - 1988 ) with strong infrared excess and a new sample of candidate rv  tauri stars ( lloyd evans 1997 ) .",
    "based on the very similar seds they concluded that in all systems , gravitationally bound dusty discs are present , implying binarity of the central object .",

    "( 2006 ) used pulsations to estimate luminosities via the rv  tauri period ",
    "luminosity relation ( alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , they only found pulsation periods in the literature for 21 stars , even though a much higher fraction of their sample resides in the instability strip .",
    "this lack of information prompted us to examine the publicly available photometric databases .",
    "here we present our findings on photometric variability of the de ruyter et al . sample .",
    "we used two all - sky photometric surveys as light curve sources : asas and nsvs .",
    "the third upgrade of all sky automated survey ( asas ) has been covering 70% of the sky ( everything south of @xmath4 declination ) since 2000 . as of writing ,",
    "the asas-3 system has produced a few hundred individual @xmath5-band magnitude measurements for each of about 10 million stars , using two wide - field telescopes ( 200 mm telephoto lenses ) , located at the las campanas observatory ( see pojmanski 2002 and references therein for details ) .",
    "the data have been online since the start of the observations and are available for download through the asas - webpageasas ] .",
    "the useful magnitude range is between @xmath6 mag , although in some cases even brighter variables ( e.g. u  mon ) have good light curves , presumably due to shorter exposure times in these fields .",
    "the typical photometric errors ( as indicated by the point - to - point scatter of long period variables ) range from 0.01 to 0.20.4 mag , depending on the target brightness .",
    "a limited northern counterpart to the asas was the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) , which captured 1 year of the northern sky over the optical magnitude range from 8 to 15.5 , providing typically 100500 unfiltered measurements for approximately 14 million objects .",
    "the instrument was a wide - field telescope similar to that of the asas project and took data between 1999 april 1 and 2000 march 30 in los alamos , new mexico ( woniak et al .",
    "the nsvs public data release is available through a dedicated webpage .",
    "we searched the two online databases for the 30 stars that have no pulsation period given in table  a.2 . of de ruyter et al .",
    "we found useful data for 22 ( mostly southern ) of these in the asas-3 and for 2 northern / equatorial objects in the nsvs observations . in two cases (",
    "hr  4049 and hd  93662 ) , the asas-3 @xmath5-magnitudes showed large scatter that was probably caused by saturation .",
    "nevertheless , one characteristic minimum was still identifiable for hr  4049 ( see later ) .",
    "in addition , we also downloaded asas-3 data for 7 other pulsating stars that do have periods listed in table  a.2 . of de ruyter et al .",

    "we could determine at least one period , while in 13 stars we infer multiple periodicity with a wide range of period ratios . in cooler ( and hence larger amplitude ) stars ,",
    "the long secondary periods correspond to the so - called rvb phenomenon , i.e. long - term changes of the mean brightness , coupled with the short - term rv  tauri pulsations .",
    "we identify five new genuine rv  tauri variables , whose rv  tauri nature was suggested by their position in the iras two - colour diagrams ( lloyd - evans 1997 ) . in a few objects we see several cases of beating , caused by multiple frequencies with ratios between 1.0 and 2.0 . in those cases we determined 2 or 3 periods , although we note that the time - span of the data is not long enough to make a distinction between non - repetitive quasi - regularity and genuine multiple periodicity .",
    "we present stellar parameters and periods in table  [ periods ] .",
    "detailed notes on each star are given in appendix  a.",
    "our study aimed at determining periods for a well - defined sample of post - agb stars , which includes confirmed and candidate binary objects .",
    "the homogeneous set of asas-3 @xmath5-band data allowed us to study photometric variability with an extended coverage of this interesting evolutionary phase .",
    "the immediate result is an improved knowledge about pulsations and orbital brightness modulations in a relatively large set of post - agb stars .",
    "let us recall that the most extensive catalogue contains about 220 objects ( szczerba et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that our 30 stars form a significant fraction of post - agb stars known to date . by restricting our investigation to the de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample , we ensured that the properties of all stars are known to similar accuracy .",
    "almost half of the sample comprises rv  tau - type pulsating variables , of which five are new identifications . assuming that the rvb phenomenon is a signature of orbital modulations , we have measured the orbital periods for three stars ( bz  pyx : 372 d ; iras  09538@xmath77622 : 1190 d ; iras  17233@xmath74330 : 735 d ) .",
    "their confirmation will require long - term spectroscopic monitoring . in three more rvb stars ( ar  pup , iw  car and ai  sco ) we measured modulation periods that are consistent with those in the literature .",
    "we find two new candidates for binary modulations ( iras  10174@xmath75704 and hd  93662 ) to add to the well - known examples of hd  44179 , hr  4049 and hd  213985 .",
    "unfortunately , in neither case are the data long or accurate enough to derive orbital periods .",
    "we can only say that the time - scales are a few hundred days .",
    "of the known binary variables , hd  213985 is most interesting for future monitoring because of the cycle - to - cycle changes of the light curve shape .",

    "gonzalez & wallerstein ( 1996 ) determined the orbital period of this system from radial velocity data to be 410.4 days .",
    "the value of orbital periodicity , however , strongly depends on the radial velocity variations caused by the pulsation . when decomposing the radial velocity changes into pulsational and orbital components , it is essential to use the correct pulsation period derived from photometry . from the present period study it is obvious that the pulsation period of 18.4622 days used by gonzalez & wallerstein was incorrect for the epoch of their radial velocity observations . instead , the value of 18.4298 day is a reasonable approximation . decomposing the radial velocity data with this latter period ,",
    "a much shorter period emerges for the orbital periodicity , instead of 410.4 days , the value of 25.67 days fits much better the radial velocity data prewhitened with the variations of pulsational origin . such a short orbital period ( if confirmed ) means that the secondary star can influence the pulsation significantly and offers a natural explanation for the instability of the pulsation period of st  puppis .        these strong period changes in st",
    "puppis occurring on a short time scale prompted us to study the behaviour of the pulsation period of this particular cepheid using all available photometric data .",
    "the period for the first half of the 20th century was published by payne gaposchkin ( 1950 ) .",
    "in general , the period was longer than now and the changes in it were apparently less sudden as compared with the recent behaviour .",
    "reliability of these period values is supported by an independent period determination made by hoffmeister ( 1943 ) based on another series of photographic observations . from the mid-20th century on , data have been obtained with photoelectric equipment and , more recently with ccd cameras . because the individual data are all accessible , a homogeneous treatment is possible for determining the instantaneous pulsation period .",
    "the data series analysed included ( in the order of the epoch of observations ) the observations by irwin ( 1961 ) , walraven , muller & oosterhoff ( 1958 ) , landolt ( 1971 ) , harris ( 1980 ) , kilkenny et  al .",

    "the temporal dependence of the pulsation period is plotted in figure  [ stpupper ] .",
    "the uncertainties of the individual period values are smaller than the size of the circles .",
    "it is seen that violent period changes are superimposed on the smooth ( yet strong ) variations of the pulsation period .",
    "most conspicuous jumps in the period occurred between jd2432000 and jd2435000 , near jd2449000 , and between jd2453000 and jd2454000 .",

    "[ teffamp ] we show peak - to - peak amplitudes of the asas-3 light curves versus effective temperature ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of lloyd evans 1999 ) .",
    "for the rvb stars , we first removed the long - term modulation . since the effective temperature is a good indicator of the post - agb evolutionary phase , the correlation between the @xmath5-band amplitudes and @xmath12 is a spectacular indication of how post - agb stars evolve through the instability strip .",
    "the temperatures were taken from de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who determined a consistent set of stellar photospheric temperatures for the majority of the sample from high - resolution spectra . for rv  tauri stars they deduced the parameters from spectra taken preferentially around the maximum light , when the effects of the molecular bands are weaker . in fig",
    "[ teffamp ] we made a distinction between singly periodic and multiply periodic ( or possibly semiregular ) variables to show how pulsation behaviour changes on the two edges of the instability strip .",
    "note that for the coolest rv  tau stars the @xmath5-band amplitude is enhanced by the temperature sensitivity of the molecular bands in the optical spectrum .",
    "however , for temperatures above 5000 k , where most of the stars lie , we expect the effect to be small .",
    "we draw several conclusions based on fig .",
    "[ teffamp ] .",
    "the position of the instability strip is very well - defined by the boundaries at @xmath134500 k and 6500 k. this is where the higher amplitude type ii cepheid / rv  tauri pulsations are excited by the @xmath3-mechanism . for stars that have left the instability strip , the pulsations are much less dynamic and regular .",
    "however , the lack of a sharp edge on the hot side is exactly as predicted by model calculations ( aikawa 1993 , gautschy 1993 ) .",
    "it is very interesting that a similar behaviour may occur for the red edge , too , although the evidence is based on a single object ( iras  05208@xmath72035 ) . despite the lack of stars between 4000 k and 4750 k",
    ", the asymmetric amplitude distribution suggests a narrower red edge for the instability strip , which might be understood in terms of a stronger damping by convection in the cooler stars .",

    ", we have used the period ",
    "luminosity relation for rv  tauri stars in the large magellanic cloud derived by alcock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which has been used by de ruyter et al . (",
    "2006 ) for estimating the luminosities of the pulsating objects in their sample .",
    "we used the same p ",
    "l relation to calculate @xmath5-band absolute magnitudes :    @xmath15 , @xmath16    for variables with @xmath17 days . to calculate luminosities , we took @xmath18 values from table  a.2 in de ruyter et al .",
    "the resulting empirical hrd is shown in fig .",
    "[ hrd ] , where we also show the boundaries of the classical instability strip , adopted from christensen - dalsgaard ( 2003 ) .",
    "we did not include stars hotter than 7000 k because the applicability of the rv  tau p  l relation becomes doubtful for stars that have parameters outside the calibrating sample .",
    "this is also true for the coolest multiply periodic star on the right - hand side in fig .",
    "[ hrd ] ( iras  05208@xmath72035 ) , but its position in the plot could still be interesting , so we applied the p ",
    "l relation to both of the periods .",
    "[ hrd ] reveals a very nice agreement with the classical instability strip .",
    "using other models of the cepheid instability strip ( e.g. saio & gautschy 1998 ; baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ; bono et al .",
    "2005 ) gives slight changes in the slope and exact locations of the theoretical edges but does not change the overall agreement .",
    "this means that the lmc rv  tau p ",
    "l relation and the adopted spectroscopic temperature estimates , both free of any theoretical assumption on the pulsations , yield a consistent physical picture of post - agb stars evolving through the instability strip ( see also lloyd evans 1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a suggestion for a more extended red edge from the outside positions of the three coolest and largest amplitude rv  tau stars ( near the location @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "this becomes more evident if we consider that the temperatures of those stars were determined in the hottest states , so that their mean temperatures are even cooler .",
    "we interpret this subtle difference as one caused by the different stellar structure of cepheids and post - agb stars .",
    "they may overlap in temperature and luminosity , but cepheids are massive stars ( 58 m@xmath1 ) , which means their density profile will be different from that of the post - agb objects .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the same efficiency of excitation at a given position of the hrd , especially at the edges of the instability strip .",
    "finally , some of the objects on the blue edge of the instability strip present evidence for multiply periodic oscillations with period ratios around 1.1 ( cf .",
    "fig.[power ] ) .",
    "the simplest explanations are the presence of radial and non - radial modes or of very high - order radial modes",
    ". the former case could be interesting in the search for mechanisms that may lead to non - spherical mass - loss ( e.g. soker 2000 ) .",

    "except where noted , nothing has previously been published on the variability of most of these stars .",
    "this star belongs to the candidate rv  tauri stars based on the position in the iras colour - colour diagram of lloyd evans ( 1997 ) .",
    "previously , hashimoto ( 1994 ) listed the star among oxygen - rich agb stars . the light curve ( fig .  [ lc1 ] )",
    "is dominated by short - period , complex variations with time - scales from 16  d to 120  d , which are hardly compatible with typical agb stars .",
    "none of these periods comes from a coherent signal that might have indicated orbital motion .",
    "de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) listed a period of 135 d , which can be traced back to hoffmeister ( 1930 ) , but which is not correct .",
    "it was already pointed out by horowitz ( 1986 ) that the period is more likely to be half or even a quarter of that .",
    "the asas data ( fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ) clearly shows alternating light curve with 67 days between two consecutive primary minima .",
    "this binary is the central star of the red rectangle nebula , with an orbital period of 318@xmath223 d. waelkens et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measured an asymmetric light curve with 0.12 mag amplitude in @xmath5 and no colour variation over the optical range .",
    "their data , taken over six orbital cycles , revealed only minor light curve shape changes , suggesting a stable configuration of the inner circumstellar disk .",
    "waelkens et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that photometric variability is not caused by variable extinction due to the orbital motion ( as was commonly assumed ) but by the variation around the orbit of the scattering angle of the light that is observed .",
    "our analysis confirms the period and , apart from a tiny zero - point shift of the photometry , we find a very similar light curve to that measured by waelkens et al .",
    "( 1996 ) more than a decade earlier ( fig.[lc1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests stable conditions around the binary over the whole baseline of about two decades .",
    "the power spectrum does not contain any excess power that could be indicative of low - amplitude pulsations .",
    "this is a well - known rv  tau variable of the ` b ' subtype .",
    "the asas data ( fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ) are not long enough to detect the @xmath212600 d modulation of the mean brightness , which was identified as the orbital period of the system ( pollard & cottrell 1995 ) .",
    "maas et al . ( 2003 ) measured an orbital period of 499@xmath223  d and found two periods of nearly equal probability , 71.9  d and 89.9  d. the asas light curve ( fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ) confirms the shorter pulsation period ( 72  d ) as well as a slightly shorter one ( 69  d ) , producing a clear beat .",
    "the presence of a third significant period ( @xmath23 for 133  d ) that is close to the twice the shortest one , supports the multi - mode interpretation of the apparent amplitude modulation . despite covering 4 orbital cycles",
    ", the light curve does not show evidence for orbital brightness variations .",
    "the variable star designation and class sr : were given by kazarovets , samus & durlevich ( 2001 ) , who referred to a vsnet report by k. takamizawa in 2000 , in which the discovery of new field variable stars was announced with no period determination .",
    "the asas light curve ( fig .  [ lc1 ] ) suggests two periods and resembles an rvb type pulsation with long - term modulation , except that the pulsation amplitude and period are far smaller than in typical rvb stars .",
    "the regularity of the modulation suggests that the 372@xmath221 d period corresponds to orbital motion .",
    "the simbad database lists this as an rv  tau variable , but no reference or period are given .",
    "the star is quite faint for the asas instrument , which is the reason for the high point - to - point noise in the light curve ( fig.[lc2 ] ) .",
    "although the determined period would be typical for an rv  tau star , the light curve is too noisy for a firm classification .",
    "this star is a c - rich rvb variable with a 67.580 d pulsation and 1500 d modulation period ( giridhar , rao & lambert 1994 ) .",
    "the latter is confirmed by the asas data , while the short - period oscillations are best described with periods of 72  d and 42  d ( fig.[lc2 ] ) .",
    "however , the shorter one , being close to the harmonic of the main period , might only be caused by the non - sinusoidal shape of a non - stationary signal .",
    "waelkens et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found a periodicity of 434 d , which was interpreted as an orbital period .",
    "the star is bright ( @xmath24 mag ) and the asas data seem to have been affected by saturation .",
    "nevertheless , one characteristic minimum was observed around jd 2452800 , which extended over 200 d and had a very similar shape to those observed by waelkens et al .",
    "( 1991 ) .          lake ( 1963 ) suspected its variability ( hence the designation nsv  4975 ) but nothing specific has been published since then .",
    "the asas data have large scatter , presumably from saturation effects , but two minima about 260 d apart are still recognizable .",
    "this star has been included in the abundance analysis of an extended sample of field rv  tau stars ( giridhar et al .",
    "2005 ) , with no specific variability information given .",
    "the light curve shows typical rv  tau variations with 76 d period ( fig .  [ lc2 ] ) .",
    "we derive variability parameters for the first time . besides a long - term modulation ( fig .",
    "[ lc3 ] ) , the light curve shows 0.5 mag oscillations with a formal period of 22 d. however , tiny differences in minima suggest a doubled period of 44 d , which puts the star among the rvb type variables .      first misclassified as r  crb star then realized it was a yellow semiregular variable ( giridhar , rao & lambert 1992 ) .",
    "we determine a period that is close to the one in the gcvs .",
    "the light curve shape is typical of an rv  tau star ( fig.[lc3 ] ) .",
    "we measure a very similar pulsation period than listed by de ruyter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which originates from pollard et al .",
    "these authors measured a long ( rvb ) period of 940 d , which is not entirely inconsistent with the asas data , especially if we consider their short time - span ( @xmath25900 d , see fig .",
    "[ lc3 ] ) .",
    "the simbad database lists as a variable star of rv  tau type , but neither the period , nor the source of information is given .",
    "besides a short period and low amplitude fluctuation we also find a long - term modulation ( fig.[lc3 ] ) .",
    "menzies & whitelock ( 1988 ) reported low amplitude variations with a characteristic time - scale of 50 days .",
    "rao , goswami & lambert ( 2002 ) interpreted their spectra in terms of an obscured rv  tauri variable .",
    "the nsvs data are quite noisy but show four distinct minima of 0.08 mag at 60 days from each other .",
    "whitelock et al . (",
    "1989 ) observed a remarkably regular variability in @xmath27-band with a period of 254 d and a peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath28 mag .",
    "van winckel , waelkens & waters ( 2000 ) measured an orbital period of 259 d from long - term radial velocity measurements , implying that the light variations reflect orbital brightness modulation , either from variable extinction or light scattering .",
    "the asas data confirm the period and show a @xmath5-band amplitude ranging unpredictably between 0.20.6 mag ( fig .",
    "[ lc3 ] ) , which means the circumstellar shell must have variations on a similar time - scale to the orbital period .",
