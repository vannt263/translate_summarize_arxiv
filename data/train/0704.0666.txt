    "one of the most dramatic discoveries of the modern cosmology in the past decade is that our universe is currently accelerating @xcite . a component that causes the accelerated expansion of the universe",
    "is referred to as  dark energy \" . although the nature of such dark energy is still speculative ,",
    "an overwhelming flood of papers has appeared which attempt to describe it by devising a great variety of models . among them are cosmological constant , exotic fields such as phantom or quintessence , modified gravity , etc , see @xcite@xcite for a recent review .",
    "available models of dark energy differ in the value and variation of the equation of state parameter @xmath0 during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the cosmological constant with @xmath1 , is located at a central position among dark energy models both in theoretical investigation and in data analysis @xcite . in quintessence",
    "@xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite and holographic dark energy models @xcite , @xmath0 always stays bigger than @xmath2 .",
    "the phantom models of dark energy have @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however , following the more accurate data analysis , a more dramatic result appears showing that the time varying dark energy gives a better fit than a cosmological constant and in particular , @xmath0 can cross @xmath2 around @xmath4 from above to below @xcite .",
    "although the galaxy cluster gas mass fraction data do not support the time - varying @xmath0 @xcite , theoretical attempts towards the understanding of the @xmath0 crossing @xmath2 phenomenon have been started .",
    "some dark energy models , such as the one containing a negative kinetic scalar field and a normal scalar field @xcite , or a single scalar field model @xcite and interacting holographic dark energy models @xcite have been constructed to gain insight into the occurrence of the transition of the dark energy equation of state and the mechanism behind this transition .",
    "other studies on the @xmath1 crossing have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "independent of the challenge we deal with the dark energy puzzle , in recent years , theories of large extra dimensions , in which the observed universe is realized as a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , have received a lot of interest . according to the braneworld scenario the standard model of particle fields",
    "are confined on the brane while , in contrast , the gravity is free to propagate in the whole spacetime . in these theories the cosmological evolution on the brane",
    "is described by an effective friedmann equation that incorporates non - trivially with the effects of the bulk onto the brane .",
    "an interesting consequence of the braneworld scenario is that it allows the presence of five - dimensional matter which can propagate in the bulk space and may interact with the matter content in the braneworld .",
    "it has been shown that such an interaction can alter the profile of the cosmic expansion and lead to a behavior that would resemble the dark energy .",
    "the cosmic evolution of the braneworld with energy exchange between brane and bulk has been studied in different setups @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in these models , due to the energy exchange between the bulk and the brane , the usual energy conservation law on the brane",
    "is broken and consequently it was found that the equation of state of the effective dark energy may experience the transition behavior ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , in string theory , in addition to the einstein action , some higher derivative curvature terms have been included to derive the gravity . in order to obtain a ghost - free theory ,",
    "the combination of quadratic terms called gauss - bonnet term is usually employed as curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite . from a geometric point of view",
    ", the combination of the einstein - hilbert and gauss - bonnet term constitutes , for 5d spacetimes , the most general lagrangian to produce second - order field equations @xcite .",
    "the gauss - bonnet correction significantly changes the bulk field equations and leads to modifications in the braneworld friedmann equations .",
    "therefore , the study of the effects of the gauss - bonnet correction term on the evolution of the universe in the braneworld scenario is well motivated .",
    "influences of the gauss - bonnet correction on the dgp braneworld have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to investigate the effects of the bulk content in the general gauss - bonnet braneworld on the evolution of the universe .",
    "although the effects of the gauss - bonnet correction term on the late time universe is small , we will see that it still plays an important role in the cosmic evolution . besides we will show that the combination of the dark radiation term and the matter content of the bulk plays the role of the dark energy on the brane and influences the evolution of the universe . in our model , in contrast to the previous models ( @xcite ) ,",
    "we do not need to break down the standard energy momentum conservation law on the brane , although our model can allow such assumption if one is interested .",
    "we will show that by suitably choosing model parameters , our model can exhibit accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition , we will present a profile of the @xmath0 crossing @xmath2 phenomenon which is in good agreement with observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present a braneworld model to describe the accelerated expansion and the effective equation of state of dark energy in the presence of the gauss - bonnet correction term in the bulk . in section",
    "[ late ] , we study the cosmological consequences of the model and in particular , its effect on the evolution of the universe .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "the theory we are considering is five - dimensional and has an action of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bulk cosmological constant and @xmath7 is the gauss - bonnet correction term @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the bulk and brane metrics , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the scalar curvature and ricci and riemann tensors , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we choose the unit so that @xmath14 as the gravitational constant in five dimension .",
    "we have also included arbitrary matter content both in the bulk and on the brane through @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , and @xmath17 is the positive brane tension .",
    "the field equations can be obtained by varying the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the bulk metric @xmath18 .",
    "the result is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the second - order lovelock tensor @xmath21 for convenience and without loss of generality , we can choose the extra - dimensional coordinate @xmath22 such that the brane is located at @xmath23 and bulk has @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "we are interested in the cosmological solution with a metric @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a maximally symmetric @xmath27-dimensional metric for the surface ( @xmath28=const . , @xmath22=const .",
    ") , whose spatial curvature is parameterized by k = -1 , 0 , 1 .",
    "the metric coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are chosen so that , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath28 is cosmic time on the brane .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor has bulk and brane components and can be written as @xmath33 the first and the second terms are the contribution from the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field confined to the brane and the brane tension @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , being the energy density and pressure on the brane , respectively .",
    "in addition we assume an energy - momentum tensor for the bulk content of the form @xmath37 the quantities which are of interest here are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , as these two enter the cosmological equations of motion .",
    "in fact , @xmath39 is the term responsible for energy exchange between the brane and the bulk . integrating the @xmath40 component of the field equations ( [ feq ] ) across the brane and imposing @xmath24 symmetry",

    "@xmath43 is the hubble parameter on the brane .",
    "( [ jc1 ] ) is a cubic equation for the discontinuity @xmath44 , which has only one real solution , the other two being complex .",
    "therefore , if we require our cosmological equations to have the right @xmath45 limit we are left with only one solution . however , this real root is too lengthy and complicated to present here . since we are interested to study the effect of the gauss - bonnet correction term on the evolution of the universe in the late time so it is reasonable to choose the gauss - bonnet coupling constant @xmath46 to be small , namely @xmath47 . using this fact we can expand the real solution for @xmath44 versus @xmath46 powers .",
    "the result for @xmath48 up to order @xmath46 is @xmath49 in a similar way , integrating the @xmath50 component of the field equations ( [ feq ] ) across the brane and imposing @xmath24 symmetry , we can obtain the discontinuity in the metric function @xmath51 , which for @xmath48 can be written up to o(@xmath46 ) in the following form @xmath52 where dots denote time derivatives and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath22 . at this point",
