    "assume that @xmath0 admits an exceptional minimal set .",
    "does this set have zero lebesgue measure , and does its complement have only finitely many connected components ?    many interesting examples of foliations are obtained by the suspension of a group action ( see @xcite ) .",
    "actually , this provides a natural framework for testing potential conjectures for general foliations . in the codimension - one context",
    ", the underlying space ( fiber ) should be obviously the circle , and the questions above translate into the next ones :    [ q : m ] let @xmath6 be a finitely generated group of circle diffeomorphisms of class  @xmath2 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 acts minimally , that is , every orbit is dense in the circle . is the action necessarily ergodic with respect to the lebesgue measure ?",
    "in other words , is it necessarily true that for every _ measurable _ @xmath6-invariant subset @xmath7 , one has either @xmath8 or @xmath9 ?",
    "m - e ] let @xmath6 be a finitely generated group of circle diffeomorphisms of class  @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the action of @xmath6 admits a minimal invariant cantor set @xmath10 ( also called an exceptional minimal set ) .",
    "does @xmath10 necessarily have zero lebesgue measure ?",
    "is the set of orbits of connected components of @xmath11 finite ?",
    "for simplicity , in what follows we will assume that all diffeomorphisms preserve the orientation .",
    "notice that the general case reduces to this one , as the subgroup of orientation - preserving elements has index two in the original group , hence it carries all its relevant dynamical properties .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide proofs of affirmative answers to questions  [ q : m ] and  [ q : m - e ] for actions by real - analytic diffeomorphisms , with the extra hypothesis that the group @xmath6 is algebraically free for the first one .",
    "the reason for just treating free - group actions comes from that the very simple algebraic structure allows giving more elementary combinatorial arguments .",
    "moreover , according to a theorem of ghys to be discussed below , it still allows dealing with actions of non - necessarily free groups admitting an exceptional minimal set .",
    "although our approach and techniques also yield a road towards question  [ two ] and eventually to question  [ one ] , more general cases are to be treated in separate works . finally , let us point out that translating our results and approach to the language of codimension - one foliations also seems to provide a road towards the well - known question of the topological invariance of the godbillon ",
    "vey class @xcite .",
    "namely , given a codimension - one foliation , one can ask whether its holonomy pseudogroup is ( locally ) discrete . in the case",
    "it is , an analogue of our main theorem , combined with theorem  [ t : kf ] below would give us a rigid description of the dynamics that would probably suffice to describe the gv class . on the other hand , if the holonomy pseudogroup is not ( locally ) discrete , a topological conjugacy is often ( transversally ) analytic , which implies the invariance of the gv class almost immediately .",
    "let us begin by reviewing some of the literature on the subject . this will allow us to state our main ( and somewhat technical ) theorem from which the results announced above will directly follow .",
    "first , in what concerns minimal actions , if the group is generated by a single diffeomorphism , then its ergodicity is guaranteed by a theorem independently proven by a. katok in the @xmath12 case @xcite , and by m. herman  @xcite in the @xmath13 case :    the action of every minimal @xmath2 circle diffeomorphism ( equivalently , of every @xmath2 diffeomorphism with irrational rotation number ) is ergodic with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "this theorem easily extends to ( minimal ) group actions with an invariant probability measure ( such a group necessarily contains an element of irrational rotation number -and is conjugated to a group of rotations- provided it is finitely generated ) . for richer actions , a partial answer to question  [ q :",
    "m - e ] comes from sullivan s exponential expansion strategy ( see for instance  @xcite ) :    let @xmath6 be a group of @xmath14 circle diffeomorphisms , with @xmath15 .",
    "assume that for all @xmath16 there exists @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . if the action of @xmath6 is minimal , then it is ergodic with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "a similar panorama arises when dealing with actions by @xmath2 diffeomorphisms with an exceptional minimal set ( that is , a minimal invariant cantor set ) @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , in such a case , no invariant probability measure can exist provided the group is finitely generated ( this is essentially a consequence of the denjoy theorem ) . moreover , if for every @xmath19 there exists @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , then the lebesgue measure of @xmath10 can be easily shown to be zero .",
    "the approach above was pursued by s. hurder  @xcite , who defined a lyapunov expansion exponent for the action : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the ball of radius @xmath24 ( centered at @xmath25 ) with respect to some fixed finite system of generators of @xmath6 .",
    "he proved that if @xmath6 is made of @xmath14 diffeomorphisms , @xmath15 , then this exponent is constant lebesgue almost everywhere on @xmath26 for minimal actions , and constant lebesgue almost everywhere on @xmath10 in case of an exceptional minimal set @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the ergodicity in the former case and the zero lebesgue measure of @xmath10 in the latter one remain true whenever the exponent is positive .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that in all the examples we know where the lyapunov expansion exponent is positive ( including those of @xmath27 and thompson s group  @xmath28 to be recalled later ) , expanding elements appear everywhere ( _ resp .",
    "_ , everywhere on  @xmath10 ) .",
    "actually , corollary  [ c : zero - lyap ] below shows that , under certain hypothesis , this must be always the case .",
    "it becomes clear from the previous discussion that a general obstacle for the application of the expansion strategy is the presence of non - expandable points :    [ d : ne ] a point @xmath29 is _ non - expandable _ for the action of a subgroup @xmath30 if for all @xmath17 one has @xmath31 the set of non - expandable points is denoted by @xmath32 ( we omit @xmath6 in this notation as the group is usually fixed ) .",
    "the presence of non - expandable points is compatible with both minimality ( with no invariant probability measure ) and exceptional minimal sets for actions of finitely - generated groups .",
    "such examples are known to exist in the real - analytic context , a relevant family being given by @xmath33 and other fuchsian groups corresponding to surfaces with cusps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are also the ghys - sergiescu smooth realizations of thompson s group  @xmath28 ( see  @xcite ) , yet these are only  @xmath34 . we refer the reader to  @xcite for a general discussion on these two families of actions .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth mentioning that _ a posteriori _ , such examples seem to be rare , forming a `` thin '' ( though very interesting  ! ) `` boundary '' between two `` more stable '' types of actions , namely , those having an exceptional minimal set , and those that are minimal and have a `` rich '' dynamics ( _ e.g. _ non locally discrete , that is , having local flows in their local closures ; _ c.f .",
    "_ proposition  [ p : affine ] ) .    in an attempt to handle",
    "( and understand ) the case where @xmath35 is nonempty and intersects the minimal set ( more rare in the minimal setting and easier to construct in the case of an exceptional minimal set ) , the following notions were introduced in  @xcite .",

    "these consist of tools that allow to compare a composition of `` simple '' @xmath2-diffeomorphisms , restricted to some `` small '' interval , to the corresponding affine map , provided that the sum of the lengths of the intermediate images of this interval is not too big .",

    "we will also use certain results on composition of one - dimensional holomorphic maps , more specifically the commutators arguments and the vector fields technique .",

    "[ s : modifications ] . the proof is done by contradiction .",

    "the desired estimate will then be proved in ",
    "[ s : growth ] by showing ( assuming a quite technical proposition ) that this sum tends to infinity exponentially .",
    "this proof involves several combinatorial arguments that are particular to the free group . in what concerns the aforementioned proposition [ p : geod ] (",
    "whose proof is postponed to   [ s : cones ] ) , we will show that the failure of its conclusion implies property  @xmath50 , as well as some other complementary properties , as for instance the existence of a markov partition for the action .",
    "next , in   [",
    "s : proof ] , we will first see how control of distortion arguments ensure that each map @xmath94 is very close to the identity on some relatively big neighborhood of  @xmath85 .",
    "taking two such maps and applying to them the ghys commutators technique and the shcherbakov - nakai - loray - rebelo dilatation argument , we will find local vector fields in the closure of the group . as a consequence",
    ", one can map any given point ( as for instance  @xmath85 ) arbitrarily close to any other one with a derivative bounded away from 0 and infinity .",
    "nevertheless , this is in contradiction with ( an extension of ) sacksteder s theorem : there exist elements with hyperbolic fixed points ( although the classical version of this is in the context of exceptional minimal sets , it extends to minimal actions without invariant probability measure ; see @xcite ) .",
    "more technical issues and outcomes of the proof ( see _ e.g. _ remark [ r : rare ] ) will be considered along the text .",
    "we begin by recalling several lemmas concerning control of distortion which are classical in the context of smooth one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "a more detailed discussion with ( references to the ) proofs may be found in  @xcite .    given two intervals @xmath95 and a @xmath96 map @xmath97 which is a diffeomorphism onto its image , we define the _ distortion coefficient _ of @xmath90 on  @xmath98 by @xmath99    the distortion coefficient is subadditive under composition .",
    "moreover , it satisfies @xmath100 as well as @xmath101 where the constant @xmath102 depends only on the @xmath103-norm of  @xmath90 ( indeed , one can take @xmath102 as being the maximum of the absolute value of the derivative of the function @xmath104 ) .",
