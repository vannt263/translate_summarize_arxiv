    "we present a systematic yet very basic review of the construction of homological evolutionary vector fields on the infinite jet spaces and on several natural classes of partial differential equations such as the gauge models . for a long time , this geometric structure developed in parallel in mathematics and physics . since mid-70 s , it has been being used intensively in theoretical physics : specifically , within the brst- or bv - technique for the quantization of gauge - invariant systems  @xcite . in mathematics ,",
    "the concept first stemmed over smooth manifolds in the problem of the homological vector field realizations of lie algebroids  @xcite , which encompass lie algebras and vector bundles and are best known in the framework of symplectic and poisson geometries .",
    "although the notion of lie algebroids in the geometry of manifolds had been known for a long time  @xcite , the proper generalization of this omnipresent structure to the geometry of jet bundles ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) appeared in  @xcite . in principle , it _ could _ be contemporary to the discovery of the brst - technique ( @xcite vs  @xcite ) . in the meantime , a steady progress in the geometry of jet spaces  @xcite created the platform for important applications of the future concept .",
    "let us name only a few of them :    * the variational poisson dynamics for the kdv - type systems  @xcite , also  @xcite ; * modern revisions of the theory of liouville - type hyperbolic equations  @xcite , in particular , the 2d  toda chains associated with the dynkin diagrams  @xcite ; * the cohomological approach to gauge fields  @xcite and ( quantum ) poisson theory  @xcite .    in this paper , we recall the jet - bundle geometry that stands behind the structures  @xmath0 .",
    "it allows us to address , from a unified standpoint  @xcite , many relevant physical models ranging from the korteweg  de vries equation and its poisson structures  @xcite to the yang  mills theories , gravity , and poisson sigma - models  @xcite .    in section  [ secinvolutive ]",
    "we first consider the evolutionary vector fields @xmath1 whose generating sections @xmath2\\bigr)$ ] belong to the images of matrix linear operators @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 in total derivatives ( and those derivatives are equal to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the three above - mentioned classes of geometries are regular sources of collections of such operators .",
    "we impose the berends  burgers ",
    "van  dam hypothesis  @xcite : namely , we let the images of the operators be subject to the collective commutation closure . this involutive setup gives rise to the bi - differential structure constants  @xcite and bi - differential analogs of christoffel symbols  @xcite . for any number  @xmath7 of the operators @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 , we reduce the setup at hand to the variational lie algebroids  @xcite with one variational anchor . having endowed the new bundle geometry with the cartan connection , we reverse the parity of the fibres in it by brute force and then construct the odd , parity - reversing evolutionary vector field  @xmath8 that encodes the entire initial geometry via the homological equality  @xmath0 .    in section  [ secexamples ]",
    "we describe three natural examples of such geometries : the variational poisson algebroids  @xcite , 2d  toda chains viewed as variational lie algebroids  @xcite , and gauge algebroids  @xcite .",
    "first , in section  [ secham ] we recall the construction of necessary superbundles using the notion of the variational cotangent bundle  @xcite and derive the representation via  @xmath0 for the variational poisson structures  @xcite . as usual",
    ", the renowned kdv equation  @xcite offers us the minimally possible nontrivial illustration .",
    "the odd vector fields  @xmath8 are themselves hamiltonian and we write the corresponding @xmath9-charges explicitly .    by exploiting the profound relation between the variational poisson geometry and 2d  toda chains  @xcite",
    ", we obtain the evolutionary fields  @xmath8 for these models of liouville type  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the differentials  @xmath8 and their cohomology carry much more information than the ordinary chevalley ",
    "eilenberg differentials for the semi - simple lie algebras at hand . being obtained from the gauge - invariant yang ",
    "mills equations under a symmetry reduction  @xcite , the 2d  toda chains represent the vast class of nonlinear euler  lagrange systems of liouville type  @xcite .",
    "this class is very interesting by itself ; moreover , the construction of the homological vector fields  @xmath8 in section  [ sectoda ] remains valid uniformly for all such equations .",
    "finally , in section  [ secgauge ] we expose the true geometric nature of the brst - differentials  @xcite or the ` longitudinal ' components of the bv - differentials  @xcite for gauge systems . in agreement with the second",
    "noether theorem , the differential operators  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 which we study here emerge from the noether relations between the equations of motion ; we explain why the same approach of @xmath0 can successfully grasp more subtle geometries without any further modifications .",
    "the gauge parameters ( that is , the arguments of the operators  @xmath10 ) , being the parity - reversed _",
    "neighbours _ of the _ ghosts _ , together with the _ antifields _ ( which will have appeared before in section  [ secham ] ) and the newly introduced _",
    "antighosts _ constitute the classical bv - zoo .",
    "similarly to the variational poisson case , the evolutionary bv - differentials  @xmath11 , which incorporate the odd vector fields  @xmath8 , are then determined by the schouten bracket of the bv - charges with the inhabitants of the  zoo .    in the appendix , we report the results of a direct search for the linear differential operators with involutive images ; their coordinate - free understanding as the variational anchors in variational lie algebroids is yet to be achieved .",
    "we conclude that the presence of the evolutionary differentials  @xmath8 is not specific to either the variational poisson or gauge systems alone : indeed , it is an immanent property of a much wider class of models .",
    "the study of the arising cohomology theories not only sheds new light on each system or structure in particular but also reveals far - reaching links between them .",
    "the geometry of jet fibre bundles is an established and well developed domain  @xcite .",
    "any deviations between the notations from different sources are easily tractable ; we follow the notation of  @xcite and adopt dirac s convention on bra- covectors  @xmath12 and -ket vectors  @xmath13 , fixing the orientation  @xmath14 on the cotangent bundles .    by default , we pronounce the standard incantation about the ground field  @xmath15 , the infinite smoothness of all mappings at hand , the locality along the oriented base  @xmath16 of the bundles ( whence emerge the jets of sections of _ vector _",
    "bundles @xmath17 instead of the jet spaces @xmath18 for maps of manifolds ) , and the locality with respect to the jet order ( whence the filtration in @xmath19 ) .",
    "we assume that all total differential operators are local , i.e. , polynomial in the total derivatives . by convention , the symmetries are infinitesimal and we identify the evolutionary vector fields  @xmath20 with their generating sections  @xmath21 . for the sake of transparency",
    ", we consider the purely even , non - graded initial geometry of commutative vector spaces , manifolds , and bundles ; the odd objects which we deal with appear later , through the explicit use of the parity reversion  @xmath22 .",
    "our reasonings are independent of the choice of local coordinates .",
    "we denote the independent variables by @xmath23 , whereas the notation @xmath24 runs through all the dependent variables such as the gauge fields ( if any in the model under study ) at the points of space - time or say , the realizations of the `` string ''  @xmath16 in the space - time  @xmath25 .",
    "the notation is multi - faceted : in each class of examples ( see section  [ secexamples ] ) , we shall recall the common specific notation so that , on one hand , an object in this review may acquire several interpretations in different contexts , while on the other hand , we shall of course meet with the habitual ghosts , antighosts , and antifields .",
    "we work with the infinite jet bundles from the very beginning .",
    "let us remember that many elementary constructions on usual manifolds first of all , the leibniz rule in the commutator  @xmath26 $ ] and the schouten bracket  @xmath27\\!]$ ] or in the poisson brackets under the multiplication of the arguments by smooth functions either entirely disappear over the jet spaces or ( seldom ) survive after a careful consideration and proper amendments .",
    "furthermore , we deal with the variational poisson structures  @xcite over the spaces @xmath28 of jets of sections for vector bundles @xmath17 rather than suppose that the target space @xmath29 for @xmath18 alone is a poisson manifold ( c.f .",
    "the variational poisson theory we exploit does not amount to the canonical formalism which one applies to a lagrangian system after taking its legendre transformation ( except for section  [ sectoda ] where we do use that approach as well ) , c.f",
    ".  @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we explicitly endow the horizontal infinite jet bundles  @xcite over the spaces  @xmath28 with the cartan connection .",
    "when introducing the modules of sections of the horizontal bundles such as the spaces of the gauge parameters , never we attempt to treat these sections as the `` collections of functions '' or use any other , equally weak interpretation of their structure because it does not grasp properly the geometry of the building blocks  instead , this shadows it with irrelevant fragmentations .",
    "indeed , let us remember that , under a differential change of the coordinates  @xmath30 and  @xmath24 , the genuine reparametrization rules for those sections are imperatively prescribed by their geometric nature ( see  @xcite for detail and examples ) .",
    "we thus ought to be careful with the @xmath19-module structure for the spaces of such sections ; this is specific in particular to the variational anchors in variational lie algebroids ( see section  [ secinvolutive ] and  @xcite ) which are neither the anchors nor lie algebroids for usual manifolds , respectively , unless the base manifold  @xmath16 shows itself in space - time as no more than a point , or unless all gauge fields are uniformly constant .",
    "this also means that we deal _ ab initio _ with the field - dependent gauge parameters @xmath31\\bigr)$ ] ; moreover , their rigorous introduction ( see section  [ secgauge ] ) demonstrates that the gauge models must be particularly restrictive in order for these sections  @xmath32 to not depend on a part of the variables that encode the points of  @xmath28 .    in sections  [ secinvolutive ] and  [ secham ] we work on the empty jet spaces ; later , in sections  [ sectoda ] and [ secgauge ] , we do on - shell . we assume the off - shell validity of the berends  burgers  van  dam hypothesis stating the collective commutation closure of the evolutionary fields",
    "@xmath33 whose generating sections  @xmath34 belong to the images of linear differential operators  @xmath10 .",
    "this may require us to quotient out the trivial symmetries that vanish on - shell .",
    "we recall that the euler  lagrange systems @xmath35 contain as many equations as there are unknowns in  it .",
    "( in contrast with  @xcite , we do not assume that the density of the action functional  @xmath36 is a differential polynomial : indeed , see section  [ sectoda ] . )",
    "we point out also that _ usually _ the equations , either in evolutionary systems or in the euler  lagrange systems , are enumerated ( more precisely , labelled ) by the respective unknowns  @xmath37 which explicitly occur in the left - hand sides .",
    "however , we emphasize that the admissible reparametrizations of the fields  @xmath24 and of the equations  @xmath38 are entirely unrelated .",
    "this produces its due effect on the transcription of the infinitesimal symmetries @xmath39\\bigr)$ ] in the former case and , in the latter , on the objects that lie in or are dual to the horizontal module @xmath40 of the equations , e.g. , on the antifields  @xmath41 ( thus , more appropriately denoted by  @xmath42 ) , the generating sections  @xmath43 of conservation laws ( for the euler  lagrange systems , emerging from the noether symmetries  @xmath44 by the first noether theorem ) , or the objects which obey the second noether theorem such as the ghosts  @xmath45 and the antighosts  @xmath46 .",
    "the 2d  toda chains in section  [ sectoda ] offer a perfect example of such discorrelation between  @xmath44 and  @xmath43 , which is brought in by force due to a purely sthetic tradition of writing hyperbolic systems with their symbols cast into diagonal shape .",
    "this requires a bit of attention ( see  @xcite ) : the noether map @xmath47 is not always the identity .    in this paper , we understand as the _ noether maps _ not only the linear differential operators @xmath48 but , for  @xmath49 , the operators @xmath50 at each @xmath51th generation of the _ syzygies _ @xmath52\\in p_i$ ] , i.e. , the equations @xmath53 at  @xmath54 , noether s relations @xmath55\\equiv0 $ ] at  @xmath56 , etc . ; the notation  @xmath57 corresponds to the modules of sections dual to  @xmath58 . in this sense , the hamiltonian operators @xmath59 and the generators @xmath60 of gauge symmetries are noether operators .    on the same footing",
    ", we note that the arguments  @xmath61 of the linear differential operators  @xmath10 which determine the evolutionary vector fields  @xmath62 do possess an ambiguity .",
    "this is due to several independent reasons and occurs not only because of the on - shell equivalence : for a given equation  @xmath63 , we let @xmath64 whenever @xmath65 on  @xmath63 . but",
    "indeed , the kernels  @xmath66 in reducible gauge theories carry the freedom as large as the presence of the free functional parameters in their description if the operator equations @xmath67 admit nontrivial solutions  @xmath68 . independently , the differential equations @xmath69\\bigr)\\bigr)=0 $ ] may have non - empty non - linear spaces of solutions  @xmath70 .",
    "this shows that the structure constants   ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) , which are bi - differential operators with respect to the arguments  @xmath71 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath72 of the operators  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 , are in fact equivalence classes of mappings .",
    "because of this , considerable efforts are required to achieve the canonical normalization of the homological evolutionary vector fields on the jet - bundle extensions of such domains , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the construction of gauge symmetries , which appear in a class of geometries very particular by themselves , is reviewed in section  [ secgauge ] .",

    ", we always highlight the geometric nature of the structures at hand and describe the links between them , as carefully as possible .",

    "we emphasize that generally speaking , the symbols  @xmath111 alone that is , _ without _ the first two standard terms in   do not determine any lie algebra structure : the true jacobi identity is given by   where the standard terms are taken into account properly .",
    "it is likely that the restoration of the standard component in   for known bi - differential symbols  @xmath111 is the cause of a fierce struggle in the modern double field theory and in the theories which are based on courant - like brackets .",
    "we notice further that the bi - differential christoffel symbols introduced in   must not be confused with the connections @xmath114 in principal fibre bundles in gauge theories .",
    "it is interesting to pursue further this emerging parallel between the geometry over the jet bundles and the known connection - based structures over usual manifolds .",
    "we remark that , in general , @xmath115 if @xmath116 , that is , the image of an operator alone may not be involutive even if the operator ( in particular , its domain of definition ) is well defined regardless of the entire collection  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 . also , we note that for only one operator ( @xmath117 ) the lie algebra of evolutionary vector fields in its image is , generally , non - abelian , which must not be confused with the abelian gauge theories ( e.g. , maxwell s electrodynamics ) corresponding to one - dimensional lie groups , which are always commutative .",
    "we finally notice that the nature of the arguments  @xmath61 is firmly fixed by the reparametrization rules @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the isolated components of the sections  @xmath61 , which one may be tempted to treat as `` functions '' and by this fully neglect their geometry , may not be well - defined as true _ functions_. we repeat that this primitivization discards much of the information about the setup and shadows the geometry which we have addressed so far .",
    "we now reduce , in a regular way , the setup of _ many _ operators and their individual domains to one operator on the large domain  @xcite .",
    "namely , we take the whitney sum over  @xmath28 of the induced bundles @xmath84 , which in down - to - earth terms means that we compose the new `` tall '' sections    [ bothtallwide ] @xmath118    obviously , property   implies that @xmath119\\subseteq\\text{im}\\,a.\\ ] ] by definition , operator   is the variational anchor in the variational lie algebroid  @xcite ; its total space is the quotient of the sum over  @xmath28 of the initial domains for  @xmath10 by the kernel @xmath120 .",
    "we emphasize that variational lie algebroids are not lie algebroids and the variational anchors are not anchors as described by their traditional definition @xcite for usual manifolds ( here , for the target @xmath29  alone but not @xmath18 ) . the operator  @xmath121 transfers the commutator  @xmath26 $ ] in the lie algebra of evolutionary vector fields to the lie algebra structure  @xmath26_a$ ] on the quotient of its domain by the kernel  @xcite .",
    "it is now entirely obvious that for a given collection  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 of the operators with a _",
    "common _ domain ( and not necessarily involutive images , but this does not matter ) the induced bracket  @xmath26_a$ ] may not determine a well defined lie structure on a single copy of that common domain ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) : indeed , it is the concatenations  @xmath32 of the @xmath102  elements  @xmath61 from the same space for which the new bracket actually appears .",

    "the conversion of the sections  @xmath61 to jet variables creates the miracle : the kernel  @xmath131 of the operator  @xmath121 becomes a linear subspace in  @xmath128 for each point of  @xmath28 .",
    "this is a significant achievement because it allows us to operate with the quotient spaces , which we anticipated when the bi - differential structure constants  @xmath106 were introduced in  .",
    "next , we take the fibres of the vector bundles  @xmath78 ( hence , of  @xmath132 ) and reverse their parity , @xmath133 , the entire underlying jet space  @xmath28 remaining intact .",
    "this produces the horizontal infinite jet superbundle @xmath134 with odd fibres , the coordinates there being  @xmath135 for @xmath79 and  @xmath136 .",

    "whatever representatives in the equivalence classes of the bi - differential symbols  @xmath111 be taken , the odd - parity evolutionary vector field @xmath140 is homological @xmath141    the proof is obtained immediately by passing from many arguments of many operators to the tall sections of wide operators , see  , and then literally repeating the first half of the proof of the main theorem in  @xcite .",

    "seemingly , the exchange between the two theories , foresighted in  @xcite , channeled through the construction of the _ variational _ schouten bracket .",
    "nowadays , the systematic and well - motivated calculation of the variational poisson cohomology only begins   while the brst- and bv - cohomology theories are an established domain of research and the subject of a vastest literature . in this review we traced the links between the variational poisson algebroids , gauge algebroids , and playing the rle of mediators 2d  toda - like systems also viewed as variational lie algebroids .",

    "this research was supported in part by nwo  veni grant  639.031.623 ( utrecht ) and jbi  rug project  103511 ( groningen ) .",
    "a  part of this research was done while the author was visiting at the @xmath311 ( bures - sur - yvette ) ; the financial support and hospitality of this institution are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we now list several operators which we obtained in a fixed system of local coordinates and whose images are then closed under commutation .",

    ", we performed the search for scalar operators that satisfy   and which are homogeneous with respect to the weights not greater than  @xmath319 .",
    "we obtained two compatible hamiltonian operators @xmath320 and @xmath321 , the odd powers @xmath322 of  @xmath323 , and the hamiltonian operator @xmath324also , there are four non - skew - adjoint operators with involutive images , @xmath325@xmath326 finally , we have found the operators that contain arbitrary functions : @xmath327 and @xmath328 with vanishing christoffel symbols  @xmath329 , and also @xmath330 the transformation rules for the sections that constitute the domains of the operators @xmath331 ,  @xmath332 ,  @xmath333 ,  @xmath4 ,  @xmath334 are yet to be found .",
    "likewise , the interpretation as variational anchors and the understanding of the physics of the models remain an open problem for the infinite class of linear total differential operators with involutive images which were found in  @xcite .",
