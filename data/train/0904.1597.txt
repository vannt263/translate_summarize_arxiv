    "the [ neii ] @xmath1 emission line has been suggested as a potential new probe of the planet formation region of circumstellar disks .",
    "it is a potentially powerful diagnostic because the neon in disks is expected to be fully in the gas phase and in atomic form . in addition , the [ neii ] @xmath1 line probes warm , ionized gas , conditions which are believed to characterize the upper atmosphere of the inner disks surrounding classical t tauri stars ( glassgold , najita , & igea 2007 ; meijerink , glassgold , & najita 2008 ) and disk photoevaporative flows ( alexander 2008 ) . because it is sensitive to low column densities of gas , [ neii ] may also be a useful probe of residual gas surrounding weak - line t tauri stars or gas in the optically thin regions of transitional disks .",

(",
    "2007 ) proposed that these scenarios could be tested by observing [ neii ] emission from higher inclination disk systems .    a more recent paper ( van boekel et al .",
    "2009 ) illustrates another possible origin for the [ neii ] emission from t tauri stars .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of the [ neii ] emission from the t tau triplet reveals that the emission is spatially extended and associated with a known outflow in the system .",
    "this suggests that [ neii ] emission may arise primarily in outflows rather than disks in systems with strong outflow activity .    to investigate the scenarios proposed by herczeg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the origin of [ neii ] emission in t tauri stars , we present here high resolution spectroscopy of the [ neii ] emission from aa tau and gm aur , t tauri stars that are not known to show strong outflow activity . apart from its high inclination ( @xmath9 degrees ; bouvier et al .  1999 ) , aa tau is a typical classical t tauri star .",
    "gm aur is an actively accreting transition object that is viewed at an intermediate inclination ( @xmath10 degrees ; simon et al .",
    "the sed of gm aur indicates that the disk is optically thin in the mid - infrared continuum , suggesting that the disk is devoid of small dust grains in the radial range 524au ( calvet et al .",
    "the observations were carried out using texes in its high - resolution mode ( @xmath11 ) with a 0.6  wide slit on the gemini north telescope on 29 - 30 october 2007 under program i d gn-2007b - c-5 .",
    "the background sky emission was removed by nodding the source along the slit and subtracting adjacent nod positions .",
    "we corrected for telluric absorption with observations of @xmath12 cma obtained at a similar airmass as that of the science targets ( the difference in airmass was @xmath13 ) .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated using the low resolution _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "spectra reported by furlan et al .",
    "roughly every 10 minutes , we took a series of calibration frames including blank sky and an ambient temperature blackbody .",
    "the blackbody observations were used for flatfielding the data , while the sky emission line observations were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the standard texes pipeline ( lacy et al .  2002 ) which produces wavelength - calibrated one dimensional spectra , was used to reduce the data .",
    "the wavelength solutions have an accuracy in velocity of @xmath14 .",
    "one challenge associated with these observations is that the [ neii ] line at 12.81 @xmath15 m falls in a gap between two texes spectral orders . by tilting a mirror within the instrument , we are able to cover the gap by shifting the spectrum on the detector and thereby accessing the [ neii ] line at the long wavelength end of one order or the short wavelength end of the next order . in the first case",
    ", the blaze efficiency rises toward the blue side of the line , while in the second case , it rises toward the red side of the line .    during the night of 29 october , we shifted the optics to enhance the sensitivity on the red side of the [ neii ] line .",
    "we spent 2590 seconds of on - source integration time on gm aur and 3238 seconds on aa tau in this instrument setup .",
    "the observed gm aur line appeared narrow , symmetric , and centered at the stellar velocity while the emission from aa tau was broad and redward of the stellar velocity .",
    "this led us to search for a line profile component that might be present blueward of the aa tau stellar velocity on the following night .",
    "we spent 2331 seconds of on - source integration time on aa tau on the night of 30 october 2007 , with our optics shifted to enhance the sensitivity on the blue side of the [ neii ] line .",
    "the aa tau data from the two separate nights were combined by interpolating onto a common wavelength scale and , in the spectral regions where data from both nights were available , weighting the contribution from each night .",
    "the weighting was used to account for the varying noise across the spectra in the overlap region ; the variation resulted primarily from the rising or falling blaze efficiency .",
    "we therefore weighted each data point inversely as the square of the noise , which was calculated assuming that photon noise dominates .",
    "this weighting is appropriate if the noise in the two spectra being combined add in quadrature . in practice ,",
    "the exact value of the weighting factor had little effect on the combined spectrum .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the resulting [ neii ] spectra of aa tau and gm aur .",
    "the spectra shown have been smoothed by 3 pixels . because 3 pixels is the width of a spectral resolution element at the wavelength of [ neii ] , the smoothing has little impact on our results .",
    "although the larger noise on the blue side of the [ neii ] line in aa tau makes it difficult to characterize the line profile with certainty , the emission appears to be centered near the stellar heliocentric velocity ( @xmath16 ; bouvier et at .",
    "1999 ) and is broad , extending both redward and blueward of the line center with fwhm @xmath17 .",
    "the line appears approximately double - peaked , with a blueshifted peak possibly further from the stellar velocity and possibly weaker than the redshifted peak .",
    "the emission redward of the stellar velocity has an equivalent width of @xmath18 .    in comparison , the spectrally unresolved [ neii ] feature detected in the @xmath0=600 _ spitzer _ irs spectrum of aa tau ( carr & najita 2008 ) has an equivalent width of approximately 24 .",
    "if the emission blueward of the stellar velocity in the texes spectrum has an equivalent width equal to that of the redward emission , the total equivalent width ( red and blue ) is @xmath19 of the equivalent width seen in the _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "such a difference might arise if either the mid - infrared continuum or the [ neii ] emission is time variable .",
    "another possibility is that the _ spitzer _ spectrum ( 4.7  slit width ) includes spatially extended [ neii ] emission that is excluded in the narrower slit ( 0.6 ) of the texes observation .",
    "spatially extended [ neii ] emission can arise in outflow sources ( e.g. , neufeld et al .",
    "2006 ; van boekel et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "spectrally unresolved emission from other lines might also enhance the equivalent width of the [ neii ] feature in the _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "however , known emission features are unlikely to contribute at this wavelength .",
    "the synthetic spectrum of aa tau presented in carr & najita ( 2008 ) provides a good fit to the molecular emission detected in the _ spitzer _ spectrum of that source .",
    "when examined at high spectral resolution , the synthetic spectrum reveals no strong lines of h@xmath20o , hcn , or c@xmath20h@xmath20 within @xmath21 of the [ neii ] line .",
    "we therefore interpret the emission features detected with texes as [ neii ] .",
    "the [ neii ] emission from gm aur has a component of modest width ( fwhm @xmath22 ) that is centered near the systemic velocity determined from measurements of the surrounding molecular disk ( @xmath23 ; dutrey et al .",
    "1998 ; simon et al .",
    "there is possible evidence for an additional emission component centered @xmath24 redward of the stellar velocity , although it is difficult to be certain because of the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath25 component might arise from either infalling gas located close to the star or gas in rotation about the star . in the latter case",
    ", we would expect to see an additional emission component with a similar @xmath24 velocity offset on the blue side of the line . because we observed the [ neii ] emission in only one order , the gm aur spectrum has much higher noise on the blue side of the line ( see  2 ) , and it is impossible to determine whether a corresponding blueshifted component is present . a more complete study of the [ neii ] emission from gm aur is needed to distinguish between these possibilities .    the emission feature centered near the stellar velocity",
    "has an equivalent width of @xmath26 , and the feature @xmath27 redward of the stellar velocity has an equivalent width of @xmath28 . in comparison , the equivalent width of the spectrally unresolved [ neii ] feature detected in an @xmath0=600 _ spitzer _ irs spectrum of gm aur ( najita et al .",
    ", in preparation ) is approximately 70 , almost three times the combined equivalent width of the two [ neii ] emission features detected at high spectral resolution . as discussed above , variability in the [ neii ] line or the mid - infrared continuum ,",
    "alternatively spatially extended [ neii ] emission , might account for the difference in the equivalent widths .",
    "we are also insensitive to very broad [ neii ] emission , particulary given the limited signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum .",
    "a line 10% above the marked continuum in figure  2 and @xmath29 wide , which is within a _ spitzer _ resolution element , would have an equivalent width of 13 , similar to the equivalent width reported for the [ neii ] line .",
    "such a broad component would be difficult to detect with our data .",
    "another possibility is spectrally unresolved emission from other lines . in the _ spitzer _ spectrum of gm aur ,",
    "the emission feature detected at the wavelength of [ neii ] is broader than an unresolved line .",
    "perhaps the feature includes a contribution from lines other than [ neii ] .",
    "mid - infrared molecular features such as h@xmath20o , hcn , or c@xmath20h@xmath20 would contribute very negligibly to our texes observations , because any such emission features , if present in the _ spitzer _ spectrum of gm aur , are much weaker than in aa tau .",
    "we therefore interpret the emission features detected with texes as [ neii ] for the purpose of this paper .",
    "thus , as in the case of tw hya ( herczeg et al .",
    "2007 ) , the [ neii ] line profiles of aa tau and gm aur are consistent with emission centered near the stellar velocity . in comparison with the intrinsic ( deconvolved ) line width of @xmath30 ( fwhm )",
    "obtained by herczeg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for tw hya , the width of the [ neii ] emission from aa tau is significantly broader ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "while the [ neii ] emission from gm aur has a velocity component centered on the stellar velocity that is more similar in width ( @xmath22 ) to the [ neii ] emission from tw hya , the [ neii ] emission may also include a redshifted emission component that extends to @xmath31 of the stellar velocity .",
    "the double - peaked shape of the [ neii ] line profile of aa tau is similar to the shape of the h@xmath12 line profile of aa tau ( bouvier et al .",

    "the h@xmath12 emission is centrally peaked ( edwards et al .",

    "however , the h@xmath12 emission ( fwhm of @xmath33 ; edwards et al .",

    "the co fundamental lines from aa tau are also double - peaked , similar to the shape of the [ neii ] line in aa tau .",
    "co fundamental emission is believed to probe the inner regions of t tauri disks ( see najita et al .",

    "the line profile shown is the average of 4 @xmath36=10 lines in the @xmath37 region .",
    "regions of poor telluric correction ( @xmath38% transmission , as determined from observations of the telluric standard ) were excluded from the average .",
    "the double - peaked co line profile has a fwhm of @xmath39 and a peak - to - peak separation of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the co profile is broader than the [ neii ] line profile , but narrower than the balmer line profile .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the basic properties of the co fundamental emission from aa tau finds that the emission is optically thick and has an average temperature of @xmath41k ( carr & najita 2008 ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the co emission will be presented in a future publication .",
    "co fundamental emission has been reported from gm aur by salyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , although it was not detected in an earlier study ( najita et al .  2003 ) .",
    "because of the low infrared continuum excess of gm aur compared to that of aa tau ( gm aur is a transition object ) , the stellar photosphere makes a more significant contribution to the gm aur spectrum than it does in the case of aa tau .",

    "this value for the veiling at @xmath43 is consistent with that implied by the sed of gm aur ( furlan et al .",
    "we subtracted the veiled stellar continuum from spectrum , and we then added back an equivalent ( featureless ) continuum in order to show the strength of the emission relative to the continuum .",

    "the average co line profile differs from that reported by salyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in that there is no significant central dip in the average line profile , because the stellar photospheric contribution to the line profile has been removed . because the average line profile is now more centrally peaked ,",

    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the [ neii ] and co line properties can also be compared with those of uv fluorescent h@xmath20 emission , another line diagnostic that is believed to probe the conditions in inner circumstellar disks ( e.g. , herczeg et al .",

    "while this interpretation might be considered for a face - on system such as tw hya , the progression of line widths in tw hya , from broader [ neii ] lines to narrower h@xmath20 and co lines , would not be expected to hold in higher inclination systems where disk rotation would play a larger role .    indeed , for aa tau",
    ", we find that the width of the co emission is instead _ broader _ than the [ neii ] emission . for gm aur ,",
    "the co line ( fwhm @xmath45 ) is also broader than the central component of the [ neii ] line ( fwhm @xmath22 ) ; the hwzi of the average co line profile could be as large as @xmath35 ( salyk et al .",
    "2007 ) , comparable to the velocity extent of the red component of the [ neii ] emission ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , the co emission is broader or comparable to the width of the [ neii ] emission in the two sources studied .",
    "if both diagnostics are dominated by disk rotation , this suggests that the [ neii ] emission arises from larger disk radii on average than the co.    this is consistent , in general , with models of the ionization and thermal structure of t tauri disks ( e.g. , glassgold et al .",

    "significant [ neii ] is found to emerge from the disk surface region within @xmath54au ( glassgold et al .  2007 ;",
    "meijerink et al .",
    "in contrast , co becomes abundant at much larger disk vertical column densities ( @xmath55 ) , and the warm temperatures and high densities needed to produce the co emission ( @xmath56k ) likely limits the emission to smaller disk radii , within a few au .",
    "although for tw hya the width of the uv h@xmath20 emission is broader than the co fundamental emission , the inverse is true for other sources with uv h@xmath20 and co fundamental emission line widths that have have been reported in the literature ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus , as might be expected , the progression of line widths found for tw hya among the [ neii ] , h@xmath20 , and co emission lines does not appear to be typical of t tauri stars .",
    "herczeg et al .  (",
    "2007 ) offered three possible interpretations for the origin of the width of the [ neii ] line observed from tw hya : ( 1 ) keplerian rotation from the very inner disk region , ( 2 ) transsonic turbulence in a @xmath57k disk atmosphere , or ( 3 ) photoevaporation at @xmath58 from both faces of a face - on gaseous disk that is optically thin in the mid - infrared continuum .",
    "while each of these explanations could , in principle , account for the observed @xmath6 line width of tw hya given its low inclination , they would produce different line profiles for systems viewed at higher inclinations .    at higher inclination , a line profile dominated by disk rotation would remain symmetric about the stellar velocity but would become broader . in comparison , a line profile dominated by turbulence would show little difference when viewed at higher inclination . in the case of a photoevaporative flow from a disk that is optically thick in the mid - infrared continuum ,",
    "the disk would occult the receding flow , producing a line profile that is blueshifted by up to @xmath58 , the nominal velocity of a photoevaporative flow ( e.g. , font et al .",
    "2004 ) .    a physical picture analogous to this last scenario is invoked to account for the high velocity blueshifted components of the [ oi]6300  line emission from t tauri stars ( e.g. , edwards , ray , & mundt 1993 ) ; although the high velocities observed in the [ oi ] case indicate a dynamical ( rather than thermal ) ejection process .",
    "font et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied whether a lower velocity thermally - driven disk photoevaporative flow could account for the properties of the low velocity component of the [ oi ] emission .",
    "a more recent paper explores the disk photoevaporative flow hypothesis specifically for [ neii ] , in both the case of a continuous disk and a disk with an inner hole ( alexander 2008 ) . in a system",

    "of the three explanations invoked to explain the width of the [ neii ] line of tw hya , only disk rotation could plausibly account for the broad profile of the [ neii ] emission from aa tau .",
    "the width of the emission greatly exceeds the width expected from either disk turbulence or photoevaporation .",
    "the apparent double - peaked line profile might indicate that the emission arises from a limited range of disk radii , similar to the interpretation given to the double - peaked co overtone lines in sources such as wl16 ( carr et al .",
    "1993 ; najita et al .",
    "1996 ) . for keplerian rotation about a @xmath60 star viewed at an inclination of 75 degrees , the redward velocity extent of the [ neii ] emission and the redward emission peak ( to @xmath61 and at @xmath62 from the stellar velocity , respectively ) would indicate emission extending from an inner radius of @xmath63au out to an outer radius of @xmath64au .",
    "the narrow ( @xmath22 fwhm ) component of the [ neii ] emission from gm aur that is centered at the stellar velocity could plausibly be explained by turbulent broadening .",
    "it might also arise from a rotating keplerian disk at radii beyond several au given the stellar mass ( @xmath65 ) and inclination ( @xmath10 degrees ) measured for the system ( simon et al .",

    "the lack of a velocity shift of this component from the stellar velocity argues against photoevaporation playing a significant role in the emission ( cf .",

    "the high velocity of the redshifted component could plausibly be accounted for by disk rotation if an ( undetected ) blueshifted component is also present .",

    "earlier studies of the sed found a smaller optically thin region out to @xmath5au ( rice et al .",
    "2003 ; see also bergin et al .",
    "these authors speculate that the optically thin region arises from the presence of a companion that has carved out a gap in the disk ( see also marsh & mahoney 1992 ) .    in comparison ,",
    "the [ neii ] emission component centered on the systemic velocity in gm aur has a hwzi of @xmath58 .",
    "if the width of the emission arises from keplerian rotation , the emission arises from @xmath79au , given the stellar mass and inclination of gm aur ( dutrey et al .  1998 ; simon et al .",
    "this component may therefore arise from within the optically thin region ( 524au ) in the interpretation of the sed favored by calvet et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see also dutrey et al .",
    "2008 ) , or from the inner region of the outer disk , if the outer disk extends in to the smaller radii favored by rice et al .",
    "figure 5 shows a model profile constructed using the @xmath71 distribution of meijerink et al .",
    "( 2008 ) where the emission extends in to 4au ( long dashed green line ) .",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio data are needed to determine if this model profile provides a better fit than one in which the inner radius extends in to much smaller radii ( e.g. , 0.25au ; short dashed blue line ) .",
    "the redward component of the [ neii ] emission extends to @xmath80 from the stellar velocity .",
    "if the [ neii ] line profile is symmetric across the stellar velocity and arises from keplerian rotation , the redward emission component can be inferred to arise from disk radii @xmath81au .",
    "this component may represent emission from a gaseous inner disk close to the star .",
    "such a gaseous disk is expected to be present since gm aur experiences continued stellar accretion at a rate typical of t tauri stars ( @xmath82 ; najita et al .",
    "the observations reported here bring to a grand total of four the number of t tauri [ neii ] emission sources that have been studied at high spectral resolution . in the high accretion rate system t tau",
    ", the [ neii ] emission is associated primarily with outflow activity ( van boekel et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the three lower accretion rate cases",
    "studied thus far ( tw hya , aa tau , gm aur ) , the [ neii ] emission appears to be centered at the stellar velocity , consistent with a disk origin for the emission .",
    "the [ neii ] emission is broader in the non - face - on systems ( aa tau , gm aur ) than in the face - on tw hya , a result that is also consistent with a disk origin for the emission .    in the non - face - on systems ,",
    "the [ neii ] emission width is narrower than ( or comparable to ) the co emission width .",
    "if the widths of both diagnostics are dominated by keplerian rotation , this suggests that the [ neii ] emission arises from larger disk radii on average than the co emission .",
    "this is consistent , in general , with models of the ionization and thermal structure of t tauri disks ( e.g. , glassgold et al",
    ".  2007 ; meijerink et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the observed [ neii ] line profiles show little evidence for an origin in a disk photoevaporative flow .",
    "this is particularly so in the case of gm aur , where the central component of the [ neii ] emission is narrow enough to plausibly arise in a photoevaporative flow , but the profile is centered at the stellar velocity rather than showing the @xmath59 blueshift that is predicted for emission arising in a photoevaporative flow ( alexander 2008 ) .",
    "photoevaporative flows may be present in these systems but contribute a small fraction of the [ neii ] emission .",
    "more recent work by pascucci & sterzik ( 2009 ) finds stronger evidence for photoevaporative flows in other [ neii]-emitting systems .    the equivalent width of the [ neii ] emission we detect is less than that of the spectrally unresolved [ neii ] feature in the _ spitzer _ spectra of the same sources .",
    "variability in the [ neii ] emission or the mid - infrared continuum , a spatially extended [ neii ] component , or a very ( spectrally ) broad [ neii ] component might account for the difference in the equivalent widths .",
    "further work is needed to understand the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "these results illustrate the ability of high resolution spectroscopy to probe the origin of the [ neii ] emission from t tauri stars .",
    "further measurements of resolved [ neii ] line profiles , for both classical t tauri stars and transition objects , are needed to determine whether the results obtained here apply to the majority of [ neii]-emitting t tauri stars .",
    "in addition , higher sensitivity line profiles than those reported here would be useful to probe the origin of the [ neii ] emission in detail .",
