    "we begin with the mathematical definition of the relevant quantities . for a density matrix @xmath15 ,",
    "the von neumann entropy is defined by @xmath48 , which is conveniently calculated from the eigenvalues , @xmath49 , of @xmath15 by @xmath50 . for a state @xmath15 ,",
    "the conditional entropy of @xmath12 given @xmath13 is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator , @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the conditional von neumann entropy of the state @xmath54 where @xmath2 corresponds to a measurement on the @xmath12 system in the orthonormal basis defined by @xmath55 ( this state is to be interpreted as the post - measurement state after @xmath2 is measured ) .",
    "it will be convenient to write this in the following form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath58 when @xmath2 is measured , and @xmath59 is the state of the @xmath13 system when @xmath58 occurs .",
    "the relevant entropy can then be calculated using  @xcite @xmath60 the entropy @xmath61 can be analogously defined .",
    "the density operators @xmath62 are obtained by performing tomography on the state of the @xmath13 system conditioned on a particular outcome ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "this generates the _ tomographic estimate _ of the uncertainty .",
    "alternatively , we can estimate @xmath14 by performing a measurement on @xmath13 in a basis which we denote by @xmath63 with outcome @xmath64 . since @xmath65 ,",
    "i.e.  measurements can not decrease the entropy , we in general obtain a higher uncertainty .",
    "the entropy @xmath66 can be calculated from the resulting joint probability distribution of both measurements , @xmath67 , via @xmath68 .",
    "this gives rise to the _ measurement bound _ on the uncertainty .",
    "we also calculate the entropy using the bound @xmath69 ( which comes from fano s inequality ) , where @xmath70 is the probability that @xmath71 .",
    "this gives rise to the _ fano bound _ on the uncertainty .",

    ", we generate the entangled photons pairs using type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) . a 0.7@xmath76 diode laser at 404@xmath77 pumps a 25@xmath78 periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath79 ( ppktp ) crystal in a sagnac configuration , emitting entangled photons which are subsequently single - mode fibre - coupled after 3@xmath77 bandpass interference filters ( if ) @xcite .",
    "typically we observe a coincidence rate of 15@xmath80 directly at the source . a half - wave plate ( hwp )",
    "@xmath81 before the sagnac interferometer controls the pump polarization and therefore allows us to precisely control @xmath24 in equation   and hence the entanglement of the generated state .",
    "additional hwps at the outputs of the fibres rotate the entangled state into the desired schmidt basis @xmath82 ( see below ) .",
    "photons are detected by single - photon counting modules ( spcm ) and their frequencies are recorded using a multichannel logic with a coincidence window of 3@xmath83 .    on alice s side , two polarization analyzer modules , each consisting of a pbs preceded by a qwp and hwp ,",
    "are separated by a 50/50 beamsplitter .",
    "one of them is set to measure in the @xmath84 basis while the other can be set to measure at some chosen angle in the x - z plane , i.e.  @xmath85 where the @xmath37 in @xmath86 is the angle of the linear polarization .",
    "the other down - converted photon is meanwhile delayed in a 50@xmath87 single - mode optical fibre spool , which is long enough to execute the measurements on alice s side and communicate ( feed - forward ) her chosen basis to bob . depending on the basis , bob switches between two analyzer bases , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is achieved by using a fast rbtiopo@xmath79 ( rtp ) pockels cells ( pc ) , aligned so as to perform a @xmath88 ( x ) operation  @xcite .",
    "hwps before and after the pc allow to adapt the switchable analyzer bases .",
    "therefore , after passing the pc , bob s photon is effectively measured in the @xmath85 ( @xmath84 ) basis when the pc is on ( off ) .",
    "the experiment itself is performed as follows . at the start of each run",
    ", quantum state tomography  @xcite is performed on the entangled photon pair .",
    "we record coincidences between alice s reflected arm of the bs and bob s polarization analyzer following the switched off pcs .",
    "coincidence measurements were integrated over @xmath89 for a tomographically over - complete set of measurements , comprising all combinations of the six eigenstates of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 on alice s and bob s qubit , respectively . using an iterative technique  @xcite we reconstruct the density matrix @xmath93 , from which we infer the tangle @xmath25 of our state .",
    "we then set the analyzers on alice s side to the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) basis in the transmitted ( reflected ) arm of the bs and perform conditional single - qubit tomography on bob s photon , from which we calculate @xmath94 .",
    "finally , bob s analyzer is set to the @xmath84 basis which allows us to calculate @xmath95 and @xmath96 directly from the coincidence counts .",
    "stepwise repetition of this procedure for varying @xmath24 or @xmath37 leads to the data presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "our aim is to rigorously test the validity of the new uncertainty relation   in an experimental setting .",
    "however , it is not the case that for all pairs of measurements there exists a state which saturates the bound .",
    "likewise , it is not the case that for all states the bound can be saturated by some pair of measurements .",
    "hence , in order to probe the bound , we try to observe the minimum uncertainties possible ( i.e.  the minimum left - hand side attainable ) . in this section ,",
    "we show how to achieve this minimum .",
    "we start by considering the new uncertainty relation in the case where the state of the system and memory is a pure two - qubit state . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume @xmath3 is a measurement in the @xmath84 basis and @xmath2 is a measurement in the @xmath97 basis , which we denote @xmath85 .",

    "we can write out the terms in equation   as @xmath103 for fixed entanglement @xmath16 , i.e.  fixed @xmath24 , and a given complementarity between the observables , i.e.  fixed @xmath37 , we want to find the corresponding entangled state @xmath98 that achieves the minimum uncertainty , so that we can get closest to the bound given by equation  .",
    "this is the case @xmath28 , i.e.  @xmath104 so that @xmath14 reduces to @xmath105 the minimum over @xmath106 is then for @xmath107 .",
    "we then have @xmath108 from the form of @xmath109 , it is clear that the minimum over @xmath110 occurs for @xmath111 or @xmath112 and has the value @xmath113 . in other words , for the case @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and fixed @xmath16 , to minimize the uncertainty , the best choice of state is @xmath114 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is related to the tangle @xmath25 through the relation @xmath115 and can be conveniently set by hwp @xmath81 in our photon pair source .",
    "note that , in this case , the bound given by equation   is achievable .",
    "this is the blue , solid line ( tomographic bound ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) .",
    "( a ) ) . theoretically",
    ", the bounds coincide for this case ( purple line ) .",
    "however , in the experiment , we find a slight difference and a worse estimate for the fano bound ( red dots ) when compared to our standard method ( purple dots ) .",
    "simulations of the experiment ( dashed lines ) are in good agreement with the data . ]    in the general case of arbitrary @xmath2 , the optimal @xmath106 can be @xmath116 or @xmath117 depending on the other parameters . however , we can always take @xmath107 and note that the minimum over @xmath110 accounts for the two possibilities ( taking @xmath106 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 is equivalent to taking @xmath110 to @xmath118 , in terms of the entropies ) .",
    "the task is then to minimize @xmath119 on @xmath110 for fixed @xmath24 and @xmath37 . for a wide range of parameters ,",
    "the minimum occurs for @xmath120 , so that the best entangled state is aligned `` in between '' the @xmath92 axis and the axis of @xmath2 .",
    "however , when the measurements are close to complementary ( i.e.@xmath121 ) , the minimum can occur at @xmath111 ( as in the case of perfectly complementary observables ) .",
    "the optimal measurement of bob is not necessarily the same as that of alice in the general case . in general ,",
    "the best measurement setting on bob s side can be found by numerical optimization .",
    "however , in the cases investigated here , choosing the same measurement on both sides provides an entropy close to that of the optimal with the difference being insignificant when compared to experimental errors ."

    "<S> more recently , driven by information theory , uncertainty relations have been developed in which the uncertainty is quantified using entropy  @xcite , rather than the standard deviation . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite derived such a relation ( an equivalent form of this relation had previously been conjectured by renes and boileau  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the new relation is @xmath11 where the measurement ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) is performed on a system , @xmath12 , and the additional quantum information held by the observer is in @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> note that this quantity can be _ negative _ for entangled states and in this case lowers the bound on the sum of the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if @xmath15 is maximally entangled , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dimension of the system . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath19 can not be larger than @xmath20 , the rhs of   can not be greater than zero for a maximally entangled state and , as mentioned previously , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are perfectly predictable in such a case , for any observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 . from a fundamental point of view , this highlights the additional power an observer holding quantum information about the system has compared to an observer holding classical information .    in order to clarify the sense in which an observer holding quantum information can outperform one without , we follow berta _ et al . _  </S>",

    "<S> s result , equation  , is most apparent for the case of maximal entanglement and conjugate observables , i.e.  for @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this scenario , bob can predict the outcome of alice s measurement perfectly , i.e.  @xmath30 , which would be impossible if bob did not have a quantum memory ( the rhs of equation   has @xmath31 for these observables ) . in fact , for any finite entanglement between alice s particle and bob s quantum memory we expect to find lower uncertainties than in the case of no entanglement . this trend is clearly observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] where we vary the entanglement ( characterized by the tangle @xmath25 ) for the case of conjugate observables . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that entanglement allows bob to predict both observables more precisely than without . </S>",
    "<S> we also use two different approaches to estimate the lhs of equation  . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a direct determination of @xmath32 ( the blue , solid line in  [ fig:2](a ) ) which requires calculation of the reduced density matrix of bob s photon for each of the alternative measurement choices and outcomes , which can in turn be obtained through quantum state tomography  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can bound the entropies by also performing a projective measurement on bob s photon , which allows us to estimate @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the observables measured by bob ) . since @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , this technique will in general only provide an upper bound on @xmath32 and therefore yield a weaker inequality . </S>",
    "<S> its advantage is that it can be estimated with a straightforward experimental test without tomography . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] we show the results of both experimental approaches and we outline the details of the entropy calculations in the appendix .        </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we investigate the new uncertainty relation for other choices of observables . </S>",
    "<S> choosing non - conjugate observables lowers the rhs of both inequalities   and  . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) we chose the relative angle between the observables , @xmath37 , as @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) which is where the unentangled bound decreases to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> inequality   is not tight in this case , i.e.  there is no state for which equation   is satisfied with equality . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , where the tomographic estimate no longer coincides with the berta _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  bound ( as it did for the case of conjugate observables ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario places more stringent requirements on the quality of the experiment in order to show that the entanglement allows for lower uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we find lower entropies than predicted by inequality   for sufficiently large entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> discrepancies from the ideal , theoretical bound are mainly due to the imperfect entanglement between the photons . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the experiment , based on the measured fidelities ( @xmath41 ) of our entangled photon pair source and assuming white noise as the dominant source of imperfection , confirm this fact ( see dashed lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) , we investigate the new uncertainty relation for a fixed partially entangled state , varying the complementarity of the observables , @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> again we find good agreement and uncertainties consistent with the new inequality , thereby providing strong evidence for the validity of the new uncertainty principle in practice . </S>",
    "<S> further discussion on the optimization of the entangled states and measurements required to most stringently test the uncertainty principle are described in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss our experiment and the new inequality in the context of the proposed application as an entanglement witness . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainty relations have been used in the past to derive entanglement witnesses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea in our case is to use equation   to bound @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> whenever @xmath43 , we can conclude that @xmath44 which is a certificate that @xmath15 is entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this is readily observed in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] : any datapoint below the unentangled bound indicates the presence of entanglement .    the best entanglement witness is for the case of complementary observables . as can be seen in fig  [ fig:2](a ) , the quality of the witness depends on the technique used . in the case that bob measures , </S>",
    "<S> our experiment detects entanglement for @xmath45 , which is higher than the analogous bound obtained with tomography , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> however , using tomography requires estimation of more parameters ( 16 vs 8) . </S>",
    "<S> an even simpler bound can be obtained using only 2 parameters , which we find to be only slightly weaker as a witness : it detects entanglement for @xmath47 ( see appendix fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : supp ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> significantly , the 2 parameters needed for the simpler bound can be obtained using local measurements , making it a very simple entanglement witness . for single qubits , </S>",
    "<S> the merits of this are minor when compared to full tomography . however , more generally the separation between the number of parameters scales like the square of the dimension of the system , making the tomographic estimate infeasible for systems comprising more than a few qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we further remark that , although one parameter witnesses exist , these usually require measurement of a joint operator , which can be difficult to implement . in practice </S>",
    "<S> these witness operators are often first decomposed into locally measurable parts  @xcite .    until recently , </S>",
    "<S> all known bounds on the uncertainty an observer can have about the outcomes of measurements on a system applied only to observers holding classical information about the system . </S>",
    "<S> berta _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  have since overcome this limitation , deriving a stronger uncertainty relation which applies when one observer holds quantum information about another system in a quantum memory . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we give the first experimental investigation of this strengthened relation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that entangling the system with a particle in a quantum memory does indeed lead to lower bounds on the uncertainty than is possible without . </S>",
    "<S> our results also quantitatively illustrate the theoretical behaviour of the new uncertainty relation , with discrepancies explained from the measured quality of our source . </S>",
    "<S> future improvements in both photon sources and detectors will allow more precise tests of its bounds . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , since we achieve lower uncertainties than would be possible without entanglement , our experimental setup acts as an effective entanglement witness , and succeeds as such over a wide range of entanglement .    </S>",
