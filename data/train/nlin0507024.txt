    "purpose and scope of this paper is to introduce and discuss a simple hamiltonian dynamical system describing the motion of @xmath0 particles in the ( _ complex _ ) plane .",
    "this problem is the prototype of a class of models @xcite that feature a transition from _ very simple  _ ( even _ isochronous _ ) to _ _ quite complicated  _ _ motions characterized by a _ sensitive dependence _ both on the initial data and the parameters ( `` coupling constants '' ) of the model .",
    "this transition can be explained as travel on riemann surfaces .",
    "the interest of this phenomenology  illustrating the _ onset _ in a _",
    "deterministic _ context of _ irregular _ motions  is underlined by its generality @xcite , suggesting its eventual relevance to understand natural phenomena and experimental investigations .",
    "the novelty of the model treated herein is that it allows a quite explicit mathematical treatment . here only some of our main findings are reported , without detailing their proofs : a more complete presentation will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the idea that the _ integrable _ or _ nonintegrable _ character of a dynamical system is closely related to the _ analytic _ structure of its solutions as functions of the independent variable ( `` time '' , but considered as a _ complex _ variable ) goes back to such eminent mathematicians as carl jacobi , sophia kowalewskaya , henri poincar , paul painlev and his school .",
    "some of us heard illuminating discussions of this notion by martin kruskal , whose main ideas  a synthetic if overly terse rendition of which might be the statement that _ integrability is compatible with the presence of multivaluedness but only provided this is not excessive _  can be gleaned from some papers written by himself and some of his collaborators @xcite , or by others who performed theoretical and numerical investigations motivated by his ideas @xcite .",
    "the results presented below constitute progress along this line of thinking . for a more detailed analysis",
    "we refer the interested reader to the papers where more complete versions are presented of our findings @xcite .",
    "the model we introduce and discuss in this paper is characterized by the following equations of motion:@xmath1__notation _ _ : here and hereafter indices such as @xmath2 @xmath3 range from @xmath4 to @xmath0 and are defined @xmath5 superimposed dots indicate differentiations with respect to the _ real _ independent time variable @xmath6 ; the dependent variables @xmath7 _ _  _ _ are _ complex _ , and indicate the positions of @xmath0 point `` particles '' moving in the _ complex _ @xmath8-plane ; @xmath9 is the _ imaginary _ unit ; the parameter @xmath10 is _ positive _ , and it sets the time scale via the basic period@xmath11the @xmath0 quantities @xmath12 are arbitrary coupling constants , but in this paper we restrict consideration to the case in which they are all _ real _ and moreover satisfy the `` semisymmetrical '' restriction @xmath13entailing that the two particles with labels @xmath4 and @xmath14 are _ equal _ , while particle @xmath0 is _",

    "@xmath8-plane , an _ infinity _ of _ near misses _ shall indeed occur . and",

    "this suggests that our model ( [ eqmot ] ) , in spite of its simplicity , might also support quite complicated motions , possibly even displaying an `` unpredictable '' evolution in spite of its _ deterministic _ character .",
    "this hunch is confirmed by the results reported below .    to investigate the dynamics of our `` physical '' model ( [ eqmot ] )",
    "it is convenient to introduce an `` auxiliary '' model , obtained from it via the following change of dependent and independent variables:@xmath24note that initially the coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath25 coincide:@xmath26the equations of motion of the auxiliary model follow immediately from ( eqmot ) via ( [ zita ] ) ( or , even more directly , by noting that , for @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29:@xmath30here of course the appended prime denotes differentiation with respect to the ( _ complex _ ) variable @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath47 see ( [ t ] ) . indeed an _",
    "system is characterized by the property to possess one or more _ open _ sectors of its phase space , each having of course _ full dimensionality _ , such that _ all _ motions in each of them are _ completely periodic _ with the same _ fixed period _ ( the periods may be different in these different sectors of phase space , but must be fixed , i e. independent of the initial data , within each of these sectors ) : and in our case clearly ( at least ) _ all _ the motions characterized by initial data @xmath48 such that@xmath49are _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath23 , see ( [ periodic ] ) , since this inequality , implying ( via ( [ zitazero ] ) and ( [ dzero ] ) ) @xmath50 entails that @xmath51 is _ holomorphic _ ( at least ) in a disk @xmath45 that includes , in the _ complex _",
    "@xmath31-plane , the disk @xmath40 .",
    "this argument is a first demonstration of the usefulness of the `` trick '' ( zita ) , associating the auxiliary system ( [ eqzita ] ) to our physical system ( [ eqmot ] ) .",
    "more generally , this relationship ( [ zita ] ) allows to infer the main characteristics of the _ time evolution _ of the solutions @xmath41 of our physical system ( [ eqmot ] ) from the _ analyticity properties _ of the corresponding solutions @xmath52 of the auxiliary system ( [ eqzita ] ) : indeed the evolution of @xmath53 as the time @xmath6 increases from the initial value @xmath54 is generally related via ( [ zita ] ) to the values taken by @xmath52 when @xmath31 rotates ( counterclockwise , with period @xmath55 on the circle @xmath35 in the _ complex _ @xmath31-plane and correspondingly @xmath51 travels on the riemann surface associated to its _",
    "analytic _ structure as a function of the _ complex _",
    "variable @xmath31 .",
    "suppose for instance that the _ only _ singularities of @xmath51 in the _ finite _ part of the _ complex _ @xmath31-plane are _ square - root branch points _ , as it is indeed the case for our model ( [ eqmot ] ) at least for a range of values of the ratio of the coupling constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 see ( [ symm ] ) and below . ) , while the number and especially the locations of these singularities depend on the specific solution under consideration and their identification requires a more detailed knowledge than can be obtained by a local analysis _  la painlev_. ] then the _ isochronous _ regime corresponds to initial data such that the corresponding solution @xmath52 has _ no branch points _ inside the circle @xmath35 on the main sheet of its riemann surface ( i. e. that characterized by the initial data ) . moreover , if there is a _",
    "( _ nonvanishing _ ) number of branch points inside the circle @xmath35 on the main sheet of the riemann surface of @xmath58 and a _ finite _ number of branch points inside the circle @xmath35 on all the sheets that are accessed by traveling on the riemann surface round and round on the circle @xmath35 , then clearly the corresponding solution @xmath53 is still a _ completely periodic _ function of the time @xmath59 but now its period is a _ finite integer multiple _ @xmath60 of the basic period @xmath34 the value of @xmath61 depending of course on the number of sheets that get visited along this travel before returning to the main sheet .",
    "hence , in particular , whenever the _ total _ number @xmath62 of ( _ square - root _ ) branch points of the solution @xmath63 of the auxiliary problem ( [ eqzita ] ) is _ finite _ , the corresponding solution @xmath53 of our physical model ( [ eqmot ] ) is _ completely periodic _ , although possibly with a _ very large _ period ( if @xmath64 is _ very large _",
    ") the value of which may depend , possibly quite sensitively , on the initial data . on the other hand if the number of ( _ square - root _ ) branch points possessed by the generic solution @xmath51 is _ infinite _ , and the riemann surface associated with the function @xmath51 has an _ infinite _ number of sheets ( as it can happen in our case , see below ) , then it is possible that , as @xmath31 goes round and round on the circle @xmath65 the corresponding value of @xmath52 travels on this riemann surface without ever returning to its main sheet , entailing that the time evolution of the corresponding function _",
    "_  _ _ @xmath53 is _ aperiodic _ , and that it depends _ sensitively _ on the initial data inasmuch as these data characterize the positions of the branch points hence the structure of the riemann surface .",
    "this terse analysis entails an important distinction among all these ( _ square - root _ ) _ _  _ _ branch points : the `` active '' branch - points are those located _ inside _ the circle @xmath35 on sheets of the riemann surface accessed  when starting from the main sheet  by traveling round and round on that circle , so that they do affect the subsequent sequence of sheets that get visited ; while the `` inactive '' branch points are , of course , those that fall _ outside _ the circle @xmath65 as well as those that are located _ inside _ the circle @xmath35 but on sheets of the riemann surface that do not get visited while traveling round and round on that circle ( starting from the main sheet ) and that therefore do _ not _ influence the time - evolution of the corresponding solution of our physical system ( eqmot ) .",
    "this distinction is of course influenced by the initial data of the problem , that characterize the initial pattern of branch points ; clearly it is not just a `` local '' characteristic of each branch point depending only on its position ( for instance , _ inside _ or _ outside _ the circle @xmath66 : it depends on the overall structure of the riemann surface , for instance if there is no branch point on its main sheet  that containing the point of departure of the travel round and round on the circle @xmath35  then clearly _ all _ the other branch points are _ inactive _ , irrespective of their location .",
    "let us also emphasize that , whenever an _ active _ branch point is _ quite close _ to the circle @xmath65 it corresponds to a _ near miss _ involving _ two _ particles of our physical model ( [ eqmot ] ) , at which these two particles scatter against each other almost at right angles ( corresponding to the _ square - root _ nature of the branch point ) .",
    "the difference between the cases in which such a branch point falls _ just inside _ respectively _ just outside _ the circle @xmath35 corresponds to a _ near miss _ in which the two particles slide past each other on one side respectively on the other ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , and this makes a substantial difference as regards the subsequent evolution of our @xmath0-body system ( unless the two particles are equal ) .",
    "the closer the _ near miss _ , the more significant this effect is , and the more _ sensitive _ it is on the _ initial data _ ,",
    "a tiny change of which can move the relevant branch point from one side to the other of the circumference of the circle @xmath35 and correspondingly drastically affect the outcome of the _ near miss_. this is the mechanism that accounts for the fact that , when the initial data are in certain sectors of their phase space ( of course quite different from that characterized by the inequalities ( [ condiso ] ) ) , the resulting motion of the physical @xmath0-body problem ( [ eqmot ] ) is _ aperiodic _ , indeed nontrivially so : in such cases ( as we show below ) the _ aperiodicity _ is indeed associated with the coming into play of an _ infinite _ number of ( _ square - root _ ) branch points of the corresponding solution of the auxiliary problem ( [ eqzita ] ) and _ _  _ _ correspondingly with an _ infinite _ number of _ near _ _ misses _ experienced by the particles throughout their time evolution , this phenomenology being clearly characterized by a _ sensitive dependence _ on the initial data .",
    "this mechanism to explain the transition from _ regular _ to _ irregular _ motions  and in particular from an _ isochronous _ regime to one featuring _",
    "unpredictable _ aspects  was already discussed @xcite in the context of certain many - body models somewhat analogous to that studied herein .",
    "but those treatments were limited to providing a _ qualitative _ analysis such as that presented above and to ascertaining its congruence with _ numerical solutions _ of these models .",
