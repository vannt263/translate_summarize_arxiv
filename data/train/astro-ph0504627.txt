    "ngc 6791 is unique among open clusters .",
    "not only it is one of the richest of them ( on the sky surveys it is easily mistaken for a globular ) ; it also has both an unusual metallicity [ fe / h ] = + 0.3 ( stetson , bruntt , & grundahl 2003 , s03 ; worthey & jowett , 2003 ) , and an anomalously old age of 812 gyr ( s03 ; chaboyer , green , & liebert 1999 ) .",
    "its apparent distance modulus @xmath1 = 1313.5 ( see discussion in ",
    "4 ) allows us to measure stars down to the neighborhood of the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "study of this cluster ( go 9815 ) in which images made with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) take us down to @xmath2 .",
    "this study is part of a more extended investigation aimed at studying stars in a low - mass regime that has never been accessible before , and will serve as an important guide for theories of the structure of low - mass stars . our color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) will check the luminosity  radius relation , while the faint end of the luminosity function ( lf ) can be used to check the mass  luminosity relation .",
    "our target objects ( ngc 6397 , m4 , @xmath3 centauri , 47  tuc , and ngc 6791 ) will allow us to cover most of the globular cluster ( gc ) metallicity regime , with an extension to supra - solar metallicities thanks to ngc 6791 .",
    "our earlier results showed that while models are able to reproduce the observed main sequence ( ms ) almost down to the hydrogen - burning limit for metal poor clusters ( see our study of ngc 6397 in king et al.1998 , paper i of this series ) , theory fails to reproduce the cmd of a moderate - metallicity gc like m4 ( bedin et al .",
    "2001 , paper ii ) .",
    "this inability of stellar models to reproduce the luminosity  color relation , and the implausible bends at the low - mass end of the mass functions ( mfs ) that we derive from our lfs cast doubt on the reliability of the adopted theoretical framework .",
    "however , as discussed by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cassisi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , this occurrence must be related to current uncertainties in the relations between color and effective temperature that are adopted for transferring stellar models from the theoretical @xmath4 diagram to the various observational planes .",
    "these uncertainties , which are due mainly to the poorly known contribution of different chemical species to the opacities of the stellar atmospheres , become more serious at higher metallicities .    because ngc 6791 lies in a rich galactic field ( at @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , our program includes a second epoch of observation , to be carried out in mid-2005 , to derive proper motions that we can use to separate out field stars .",
    "the first - epoch images have yielded so much interesting information , however , that we feel that they merit the report that is given here .",
    "in fact , we are already able to present the deepest cmd of ngc 6791 , with a ms which extends down to the hydrogen - burning limit , and , for the first time , the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling sequence , possibly down to the faintest wds in ngc 6791 .",
    "this paper will concentrate on the presentation of the data set , on the data reduction , and on the main - sequence stars .",
    "the white dwarf cooling sequence will be discussed in a separate paper bedin et al.(2005b ) .",
    "our observations , made with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of acs , were of a field centered 1.5 arcmin ne of the cluster center .",
    "they were taken on 16 and 17 july , 2003 , through the f606w and f814w filters ; in each filter the exposure times were 3 @xmath7 30 sec + 2 @xmath7 1142 sec + 4 @xmath7 1185 sec .",
    "the images in each color were dithered by fractional pixels , for better photometry and astrometry .",
    "we made our first measurements on the _ flt images , which are a pipeline output that includes corrections for bias and flat field .",
    "we corrected pixel values for geometrical distortion according to the recipe given by anderson ( 2002 ) .",
    "then , in order to reach as faint as possible , we created a stacked image in each color , as follows . we first measured magnitudes and positions in each image using the epsf method described by anderson & king ( 2000 ) , and we corrected these positions for geometrical distortion using the anderson ( 2002 ) prescription .",
    "we then chose one of the images as a reference frame , and found the best linear transformation between each of the other images and this frame .",
    "since acs / wfc images are undersampled , we made a stack in which the original 50 mas pixels are subsampled by a factor of 2 in each direction .",
    "this we accomplished as follows . for each pixel of the super - sampled image",
    ", we calculated the position to which it corresponds in each of the distortion - corrected images , and chose a pixel value derived from bi - linear interpolation in that image .",
    "( there is no need to allow for the fact that the new pixels are smaller , since the magnitude zero point will be calibrated only at a later stage . )",
    "we calculated the mean of these 6 values , using residuals to eliminate outliers by sigma - clipping at the @xmath8 level",
    ".    we will refer to the resulting stacks as super - stacks . for all but the brightest stars our final photometry was performed on the two super - stacks , using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and allstar ( described in the daophot user s manual ) , with a psf based on a moffat function , and a quadratic spatial variation .    in attempting to push photometry to a faint limit",
    ", there is always a problem with false detections at the faint end .",
    "we used three criteria to eliminate false objects .",
    "first , we did the find operation with a threshold of 3.5 times the sigma of the background , in order to minimize the background noise effects .",
    "then we eliminated as many false objects as possible by requiring that the absolute value of the sha parameter of daophot be less than 0.2 and that the positions of the star in each of the two super - stacks agree within a distance of 0.5 pixel . before choosing the numerical criteria just quoted , we carried out photometry using a number of other values of the parameters and examining the resulting color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ; we adopted the values that appeared to give the best compromise between accepting false stars and losing real ones .    because stars brighter than @xmath9   @xmath10 20.5 were saturated in the long exposures , for them we used photometry by the method of anderson & king ( 2000 ) on the short - exposure images .",
    "the super - stack magnitudes were put on the zero point of the short - exposure images by comparing the magnitudes of a large number of well - measured , non - saturated stars that were common to both sets .",
    "the zero points were set by the procedures described in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .    our final step was a determination of completeness as a function of magnitude .",
    "this we did by adding artificial stars ( constructed from our psf , with a realistic amount of noise added ) .",
    "in the artificial - star tests 38,000 stars , on a grid with a spacing of 42 pixels , were added to each of the super - stacks .",
    "the grid was displaced by a random number of pixels in each coordinate , the number ranging from zero to one less than the separation .",
    "the same displacement was used for each color .",
    "the artificial stars had random @xmath9  magnitudes over a range of 7 magnitudes ( 23.5 @xmath11 @xmath9   @xmath11 30.5 ) .",
    "two separate experiments were carried out . in one ,",
    "the @xmath12  magnitude was chosen so as to place the star on the ridge line of the white - dwarf sequence ; in the other , the stars were on the ridge line of the main sequence .",
    "the super - stacks containing the artificial stars were processed in exactly the same way as the real super - stacks had been .",
    "the results of the artificial star tests on the ms are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the left panel shows , in a cmd , the input ( continuous line ) and output magnitudes . the right panel of fig .",
    "1 shows that our ms star counts are @xmath13% complete for all magnitudes @xmath9  @xmath14 .",
    "figure  2 shows our full cmd of ngc 6791 for the @xmath153200 stars which remain after the selection described in the preceding section .",
    "the cmd extends for 15 magnitudes , from a couple of magnitudes above the to down to @xmath9  @xmath15 29 , i.e. , @xmath16 magnitudes fainter than in s03 .",
    "the cmd shows a main sequence with a well - defined turn - off , as well as several magnitudes of a white - dwarf sequence .",
    "as expected from the relatively low galactic latitude of the cluster ( @xmath6 ) , the entire cmd is contaminated by field stars . as mentioned above",
    ", we will use our second - epoch images ( july 2005 ) to remove the field stars by measuring the proper motions of all the stars .",
    "the field stars are not nearly so numerous , however , as to obscure the cluster cmd , which is clearly visible down to @xmath9   @xmath17 .",
    "according to the artificial star tests the completeness of our photometry is 50% at @xmath9  = 28.34 , and reaches 90% at @xmath9  = 27.5 .",
    "indeed , we still see numerous faint field stars , but the cluster sequence seems to be dwindling away .    in fig .  2",
    "there is a clear indication of a well - populated binary sequence running parallel to the ms , and of a possible white dwarf - white dwarf binary sequence , parallel to the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "both sequences indicate that the fraction of binaries in this cluster must be relatively high .",
    "a more quantitative analysis will be done when we will have removed the field stars .",
    "2 also contains two very blue stars that correspond to subdwarf candidates discussed by kaluzny & rucinski ( 1995 ) and s03 ( nos.11562 and 12652 in their catalog , http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/stetson/ngc6791/ngc6791.dat ) .",
    "( the other s03 subdwarf candidates are outside our field . )",
    "these stars are likely cluster members ( s03 ) , and their presence in such a metal - rich cluster is noteworthy .",
    "they might correspond to very hot hb stars , implying some anomalously high mass loss along the red giant branch , or an anomalous composition ( e.g. , strong helium enhancement , as found in piotto et al .  2005 for a subsample of stars in omega centauri ) .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to compare our cmd directly with that of s03 , on account of differences in the color systems .",
    "the magnitudes of s03 are in standard _ bvi _ , whereas our magnitudes are constrained , by observational necessity , to be in the system defined by the f606w and f814w filters of _",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath18 @xmath9  and @xmath19 @xmath12   differences between s03 and our photometry as , a function of the @xmath20 color .",
    "comparison between the s03 @xmath21 magnitudes and our @xmath12 , for stars measured in common , shows that on the average they are nearly identical , for the range of nearly 8 magnitudes that is covered , with a small offset of @xmath150.05 magnitude ( which we believe arises from the difference between the two passbands rather than from any error in our zero point ) , and only a slight non - linearity ; but there is no guarantee that this will continue to fainter magnitudes , where the stars are so cool that their spectra are full of complicated features . even a small difference between the two passbands can have sizable effects .    for the @xmath0 magnitudes , however , the situation is very different , and illustrates a serious problem , often not properly taken into account in photometric studies based on _ hst _  data . there is a pronounced color equation between the s03 @xmath0 and our @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , it can be expected that this color equation will be strongly non - linear for the fainter , redder stars .",
    "that this is so can be shown by means of synthetic photometry , in which theoretical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are integrated over the passbands of various systems and filters . not only does the color equation between @xmath9and @xmath0 become grossly non - linear for redder stars ; the non - linearity depends strongly on metallicity .",
    "( we plan to devote a separate paper to the problem of color equations . )",
    "thus the faint part of our ms has to stand completely on its own ; there is no way of tying it to the s03 ms .",
    "the problem , already mentioned in the introduction , is that even the best available seds are able to match the lower - ms colors of globular clusters only at the lowest metallicities .",
    "one of the aims of our studies , of course , is to provide theoreticians with actual stellar colors against which they can test their model atmospheres .",
    "from this point of view it makes no difference that our cmd is not in @xmath0 and @xmath21 ; at the metallicity of ngc 6791 the transformation from the ( @xmath9,@xmath22@xmath9   @xmath23 @xmath12 ) system to @xmath24 is no worse known than is the transformation from @xmath25 , since both are quite unknown .",
    "it is a sad fact that for faint red stars of the metallicity of ngc 6791 no seds at all exist yet , so comparison of observation with theory will have to await the appearance of the theory .",
    "the real value of a system such as _ ubvri _ is that observers can intercompare their observations conveniently if they all agree to use that system . for the comparison of observation with theory ,",
    "however , all systems are equally valid , because comparison depends only on the basic operation of integrating the seds of the theory over the passbands of the observing system .",
    "one of the driving reasons of this entire project , and , in general , the main reason for studying the cmd of a cluster , is for comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution models .",
    "such comparisons provide important information on the stellar structure and atmosphere , and allow measuring important cluster parameters , including the age and the mass function .",
    "the most appropriate way to perform such a comparison is to transform the theoretical tracks into the observational plane .",
    "these transformations become more and more uncertain for stars much cooler or much hotter than the sun , and , as noted in the previous section , the problem becomes really severe for supra - solar metallicities , to the point that we expect that our observations will provide important new inputs to the theoreticians working in this field .",
    "unfortunately , there is an additional problem that complicates our efforts :   the ( often large ) uncertainties in the reddening and the distance modulus of the object observed .",
    "these uncertainties are particularly large in the case of ngc 6791 , for which various studies in the last 20 years have found reddening values @xmath26 and true distance modulus @xmath27 ( see s03 , and references therein ) .",
    "definitive measurements of the reddening , distance , and age of ngc 6791 are beyond the scope of the present paper . however , taking advantage of the shape of the ms around the turn - off ( to ) , we still can extract some useful information from our data ( information that was also used in the companion paper on the wd cooling sequence [ bedin et al .",
    "2005b ] ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the same cmds as in fig .",
    "2 , zoomed around the to . in order to estimate the cluster age and distance modulus",
    ", we used the theoretical framework presented by pietrinferni et al .",
    "we refer the interested reader to that paper for a detailed discussion of the stellar evolutionary models for both h- and he - burning phases . here",
    "it is enough to note that these stellar models and isochrones are based on the most up - to - date physical scenario that is currently available .",
    "the whole theoretical framework has been transferred from the theoretical plane to the observational johnson - cousins one by using the recipes described by pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while for the acs system on board _ hst _",
    "we adopted the color - effective - temperature relations , bolometric - correction scale , and color transformations presented by bedin et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "in order to fit the cmd of ngc 6791 , we have used the evolutionary models corresponding to the chemical composition @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( i.e. , [ m / h ] = 0.26 ) .    in figure  4",
    "we show the best fit we could get by eye .",
    "this would imply an age of @xmath159 gyr , an @xmath30 , and an apparent distance modulus @xmath31 , which would correspond to a true distance modulus @xmath32 , i.e. , a distance of @xmath154 kpc from us . note that while the distance modulus differs by only 0.2 mag from the distance modulus found by s03 , the reddening is significantly higher ( by 0.06 magnitude ) .",
    "( we note also that carney , lee , & dodson [ 2005 ] recently found from an infrared study @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ) these differences in the estimated distance modulus and reddening are due in part to the combination of different assumptions adopted in computing the stellar models used in the present work and in the models used by s03 ( for instance , the initial he content and physical inputs such as the equation of state ; for a detailed discussion of a variety of stellar models , see vandenberg et al .",
    "2000 , and pietrinferni et al .   2004 ) , and in part to the different bolometric corrections used to transfer the various sets of stellar models from the theoretical plane to the observational ones .",
    "however , as shown in figs .  5 and 6 , using our isochrones , properly transformed into the standard _ bvi _ system , with the data of s03",
    ", we obtain an age , distance , and reddening consistent with the values used in the fit of fig .",
    "4 . only with a higher metallicity ( [ m / h ] = + 0.4 )",
    "would we obtain a smaller reddening ( @xmath35 , still above their 0.09 ) .",
    "we also performed the same exercise as in fig .",
    "22 of s03 .",
    "basically , we compared the color of the to in a @xmath36 vs.  @xmath20 two - color diagram with theoretical to colors for four different metallicities ( [ m / h ] = @xmath230.25 , 0.05 , 0.25 , 0.4 ) and for ages in the interval 715 gyr , at steps of 1 gyr . adopting a reddening law @xmath37 , we obtained a larger age ( @xmath151213 gyr ) , and a smaller reddening ( @xmath38 ) than those suggested by figs .  46 , but very similar to the values suggested by s03 .",
    "in this case one works only with differential numbers within the cmd ; however , the results are based on the ( uncertain ) color of only one observational point , namely the to .",
    "we prefer the more traditional approach of isochrone fitting , as it takes advantage also of the shape of the msto and sgb regions .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "4 , 5 , and 6 indicate that the shape of the to - sgb region is well reproduced by an isochrone at 9 gyr , and that isochrones for ages @xmath3910 gyr are too flat and have too short a distance between the to and the bend in the sgb to be able to reproduce the observed sequence . in conclusion , according to our models , both our cmd on the _ hst _  acs system and the s03 cmd suggest that ngc 6791 is a very old cluster , with an age greater than 8 gyr , assuming for it a metallicity @xmath40<0.4 $ ] .",
    "there are two important notes to add here .",
    "first of all , there is some inconsistency in the reddenings obtained in the fits of figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "this is in part related to the intrinsic uncertainties of the isochrone fitting ( because of the well - known degeneracy in age , distance , and reddening ) , but problems with the transformation of the models from the theoretical plane to the observational _ bvi _ plane can not be exluded .",
    "more importantly , fig .",
    "4 ( which is in the acs observational system ) shows that the models are unable to reproduce the observed cmd for @xmath41 , being too blue compared with the observed sequences .",
    "the same procedure does give a good fit to the _ bvi _ magnitudes of s03clear evidence that the disagreement here is due to uncertainty in the color - effective - temperature relations .",
    "in this context we should note that our isochrones were transferred from the theoretical diagram to the standard johnson system by using accurate tabulations of bolometric corrections and color-@xmath42 relations based on the updated model atmospheres by castelli & kurucz ( 2003 ) .",
    "in the regime of low - mass main - sequence stars , however , ( i.e. , ms stars with @xmath43  k ) , the empirical color-@xmath42 relationships provided by houdashelt , bell , & sweigart ( 2000 ) were adopted , since they provided a better fit of the ms locus of some selected open clusters ( see pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 for details ) . in the case of the acs observational system",
    ", we rely fully on the theoretical color-@xmath42 transformations provided by bedin et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , since empirical calibration is lacking .",
    "this explains the apparent inconsistency  given that the theoretical stellar models are the same in all the figures  of the results obtained in figs .",
    "46 .    for the benefit of comparisons with theory , we quote the colors of the main - sequence ridge line . for steps of 0.5 mag in @xmath9  from 18.5 to 28.5 ,",
    "the values of @xmath9  @xmath23 @xmath12  are 0.76 , 0.84 , 0.93 , 1.05 , 1.18 , 1.36 , 1.53 , 1.72 , 1.87 , 2.03 , 2.16 , 2.28 , 2.39 , 2.47 , 2.54 , 2.62 , 2.72 , 2.82 , 2.94 , 3.14 , 3.38 .",
    "one of the ultimate aims of this project is to derive a luminosity function ( lf ) of ngc 6791 , with the field stars cleanly removed by means of a proper - motion study . at the present time , even with only one epoch , we can derive a preliminary lf , by making a statistical allowance for the field stars . in a cmd of the cluster",
    ", we mark out the main - sequence ridge line ( msrl ) , and we subtract its color from the color of each star , so as to have a ms that stands vertically . in this verticalized cmd it is fairly easy to mark a color range that comfortably encompasses the ms stars , with a spread that increases at fainter magnitudes to allow in a rough way for the increased photometric errors . for the field stars we choose a region to the blue of the ms , and somewhat separated from it .",
    "( we do not go to the red side , because there is a strong indication of a cluster binary sequence on that side . )",
    "the color range for the field stars is twice as wide , because the poisson error of the field - corrected ms counts will then be @xmath44 ; the number of field stars then makes only a small contribution to the error .",
    "figure 7 shows the successive stages of this process .",
    "for clarity the verticalized ms is shown at two different scalings . at the far right",
    "is the lf , after correction for completeness , with its error bars .",
    "the dotted histogram shows the size of the correction that was made for field stars .    the quantity of real interest , however , is the mass function ( mf ) .",
    "since the lf and the mf refer to the same stars , it is clear that @xmath45 where the notation should be obvious ; the minus sign is needed because @xmath46 and @xmath47 increase in opposite directions .",
    "thus we find the mf simply by multiplying the lf by @xmath48 .",
    "to do this , however , we need to know the mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) at the metallicity of ngc 6791which is lacking , because no appropriate set of color-@xmath42 transformations and bolometric corrections is available for very - low - mass stars with metallicity higher than solar . to alleviate this problem we used the following work - around . from our own",
    "set of stellar models we evaluated the difference in the f606w magnitude between stellar models with the same mass and age ( @xmath49  gyr ) , but different metallicities :  the solar one and the metallicity adopted for ngc 6791 , @xmath28 .",
    "we did this in the mass range 0.50.8@xmath50 ; the mean value was @xmath51 mag .",
    "we then applied this constant difference to a solar mlr extending to very - low - mass stars , and used the resulting mlr for the conversion .",
    "it has to be emphasized that this is a crude approximation to the true mlr for high - metallicity stars .",
    "nevertheless , we think that for lack of a more reliable mlr , this approach should give us a not - too - gross estimate of the mf of ngc 6791 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 8 , in which successive panels show the lf , the mf in linear units , and the mf in logarithmic units .",
    "the mf is fairly flat , with irregularities that are probably due to non - optimal field subtraction .",
    "we will not comment on it further , because of the crude way in which it was derived , and because the second - epoch observations will lead to a more reliable mf .",
    "one of the major purposes of this project was to study the main sequence in the neighborhood of the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "the large error bars clearly make that impossible at the present stage . the faintest bin ,",
    "for example , has only @xmath52 stars in it .",
    "but after we get our second - epoch observations , proper motions will identify the stars that are actual cluster members , and our study will be able to proceed .",
    "our intention is to do as we did in the case of m4 ( bedin et al .",
    "2001 ) , using the much fainter limiting magnitude of the stars found in @xmath12  but not in @xmath9  to show that stars having the cluster motion drop nearly to zero well above the limit .",
    "first - epoch _ hst _   observations of ngc 6791 have led to a color - magnitude diagram in which the main sequence can be followed to magnitudes in the vicinity of the hydrogen - burning limit  about 6 magnitudes fainter than the ground - based cmd of stetson et al.(2003 ) . in the region of overlap",

    ", we make a statistical subtraction of field stars to get a preliminary luminosity function .",
