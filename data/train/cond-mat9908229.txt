    "bose - einstein condensation has been observed in magnetically trapped dilute vapors of@xmath6  the alkali elements @xmath7rb  @xcite , @xmath8na  @xcite , @xmath0li  @xcite , and @xmath9h  @xcite . at the nanodegree temperatures of these experiments ,",
    "the systems would have frozen solid long ago were they in free space . in the confining trap , however , zero - point motion keeps the atoms apart , and the systems remain gaseous .",
    "the case of @xmath0li is special , however , in that the interatomic interaction is predominantly attractive , as indicated by a negative scattering length .",
    "thus , the condensate in @xmath0li should be less stable than the other cases .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the nature of the instability , its onset , and manifestations .",
    "the object of study is the condensate wave function @xmath10 , which gives the probability amplitude for annihilating one particle in the condensate at @xmath11 at time @xmath12 .",
    "we use the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , or nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , which corresponds to a mean - field approximation :    @xmath13 \\psi   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "u_{0 } & = & \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar ^{2}|a|}{m }   \\label{nlse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is a negative scattering length , and the external potential is taken to be harmonic : @xmath15 this defines a characteristic length @xmath16 , the width of the unperturbed ground - state wave function : @xmath17 the number of condensate particles enters through the normalization @xmath18 which is a constant of the motion .",
    "another constant of the motion is the hamiltonian @xmath19 \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] the parameters used in @xmath0li   experiments correspond to @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is taken to be approximately equal to the geometric mean of the three circular frequencies of the experimental trap .",
    "equation ( [ nlse ] ) does not  take into account the coupling between the condensate and the `` thermal cloud '' of uncondensed atoms , nor does it describe the loss of atoms from the trap  due to collisions .",
    "these effects will be considered later .    in free space",
    ", the nlse with attractive interactions has an instability known in plasma physics as  `` self - focusing '' @xcite , whereby the initial wave function develops a singularity in finite time , corresponding to a local collapse to a state of infinite density . in an external trap",
    ", however , the ground state is apparently stable , as long as @xmath1 is not too large , as indicated by variational calculations using a gaussian trial wave function @xcite .",
    "the width of the gaussian narrows with increasing @xmath1 , and collapses to zero at some critical value @xmath2 this conclusion is borne out by other studies @xcite . in particular , kim and",
    "zubarev  obtain an exact upper bound for @xmath22 , which for a gaussian wave function gives @xmath23 ueda and leggett @xcite obtain the upper bound in a variational calculation .",
    "for the @xmath0li   parameters ( [ parameters ] ) , this formula gives @xmath24 . in the numerical calculations",
    "described later , we obtain @xmath25 or @xmath26 for the @xmath0li parameters .",
    "this number becomes slightly larger when gain and loss effects are taken into account .",
    "actually , even ignoring collisional loss , the condensate is only metastable for @xmath27 , for it can decay via quantum tunneling .",
    "this effect is not described by the nlse , although an approximate decay amplitude can be obtained by continuation of the nlse to imaginary time .",
    "kagan et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the amplitude by calculating an overlap integral between initial and final states represented by gaussian wave functions , and obtained @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the widths of the initial and final wave functions . through numerical calculations ,",
    "shuryak   @xcite found that the decay rate is proportional to @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "stoof   @xcite wrote down a wkb formula for the decay rate , but did not explicitly evaluate it . using variational wave functions , ueda and",
    "leggett  @xcite obtained a rate proportional to @xmath32.$ ] these estimates indicate that the tunneling probability is negligible unless @xmath33 .",
    "however , the wkb approximation breaks down in this neighborhood , and reliable calculations become difficult . in experimental terms",
    ", it is also difficult to observe tunneling in the present system , because the effect is masked by collisional loss , especially near @xmath34 @xcite . for these  reasons",
    ", we shall not calculate the tunneling amplitude in this paper ; but we will give a qualitative discussion of  the phenomenon , in as far as it pertains to the instability of the system .    ueda and huang",
    "@xcite formulated an approach to the stability problem , including tunneling , in terms of the feynman path integral for a transition amplitude . in a saddle - point approximation to the path integral , one obtains the nlse as the saddle - point condition , whose continuation into imaginary time yields the tunneling amplitude . starting with a gaussian initial wave function",
    ", they assume that it remains gaussian , in order to analyze the problem analytically . in this `` gaussian approximation ''",
    ", it was found that , as soon as @xmath35 @xmath22 , the system begins to collapse locally , in a region at the center of the trap .",
    "the size of this region grows as @xmath1 increases . by putting the nlse in hydrodynamic form",
    ", one can see that the pressure becomes negative inside this `` black hole '' , and , consequently , there would be infinite density fluctuations .    in the present work ,",
    "we remove the gaussian approximation by performing numerical calculations .",
    "we verify that the picture presented by ueda and huang is correct . for @xmath35 @xmath22 , a `` black - hole ''",
    "does appear at the center of the trap , within which the density has sharp local maxima , whose heights grow as the grid size for the numerical computation is decreased .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the density becomes divergent in the continuum limit .",
    "finally , we take into account gain and loss mechanisms by adding phenomenological terms to the nlse .",
    "we are able to study in some detail the growth - collapse cycles of the condensate , as anticipated in earlier work @xcite .",
    "to give an overview of the mechanisms for instability , we think of the condensate wave function at each spatial point as a `` coordinate , '' which moves in an effective potential , consisting of the last two terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , plus fluctuation corrections arising from the term @xmath36 .",
    "the system is classically stable when this motion is bounded at all spatial points .",
    "we immediately see that the attractive interaction term @xmath37 can lead to instability , for it decreases without bound when the density increases .",
    "the question is whether there is an energy barrier guarding against the free fall .",
    "a precise definition for the effective potential can be modeled after that for a spatially uniform system in quantum field theory@xcite . for a qualitative description ,",
    "however , it is much simpler to use the `` gaussian approximation''@xmath6introduced by ueda and huang@xcite , where we assume that the wave function is gaussian , given by its initial form @xmath38 where @xmath39 we introduce a width parameter @xmath40 by putting @xmath41 thus , @xmath42 corresponds to the ground - state eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator . with this",
    ", we have @xmath43 where @xmath44\\ ] ] and in this approximation",
    "the effective potential is @xmath45 |\\psi |^{2}-\\frac{u_{0}}{2}%    for different @xmath46 .",
    "there is an energy barrier with height @xmath47 ^{2}\\ ] ] which is nonzero at @xmath48 , because @xmath49 . at large @xmath50",
    "the effective potential tends to @xmath51 . in reality , of course , the nlse ceases to be valid somewhere along the drop , for other physical effects , such as solidification , come in .",
    "a typical initial wave function @xmath52 is shown on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ aekhfig1 ] . at a given @xmath46",
    ", we can measure the wave function on the left panel , and transfer it to the horizontal axis on the right panel .",
    "if it lands to the left of the barrier maximum for the particular @xmath53 then the system at that point is classically stable , but can decay via quantum tunneling as indicated by the classically forbidden path @xmath54 .",
    "if it lands to the right , the system at that @xmath46 will rapidly collapse to a state of high density .    since @xmath52 has a maximum at @xmath48 with value proportional to @xmath55 , the system may only decay via tunneling at any @xmath46 , if @xmath6it is classically stable at @xmath48 .",
    "otherwise , the system in a region about @xmath48 will rapidly collapse .",
    "the condition for stability against collapse is therefore @xmath56 which corresponds to @xmath27 , with @xmath57 the time for the onset of  local collapse is expected to be greater than the time needed to establish a quasi - stationary initial wave function .",
    "thus , @xmath40 should correspond to the best gaussian approximation to that wave function .",
    "this expectation is verified by numerical calculations described below , which also show that the gaussian approximation is very good , up to the onset of collapse .",
    "of course , @xmath58 ceases to have meaning once the collapse begins , for @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical calculations for @xmath59 , which is just below @xmath22 , give @xmath60    as mentioned earlier , we will not calculate the tunneling amplitude in this paper , but concentrate on numerical solutions of the nlse in real time .",
    "we seek spherically symmetric solutions to the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) , for the parameters ( [ parameters ] ) for the @xmath0li experiments . for convenience we put @xmath61 with the boundary condition @xmath62 , and the normalization condition @xmath63 from now on , we shall measure distance in units of @xmath16 , and time in units of @xmath64 .",
    "to do this without introducing new symbols for dimensionless distance and time , we formally put @xmath65 .",
    "the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) then takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 the initial condition with gaussian form is @xmath68 where @xmath69 we calculate @xmath70 numerically as a complex function , using an implicit difference equation algorithm due to goldberg et al.@xcite .",
    "to find out how various initial states relax to a stationary state , we first solve the equation with an initial wave function uniform within a certain radius , and zero outside .",
    "for @xmath71 , which is somewhat below the critical number , the time development is shown in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig2](a ) .",
    "we see that the modulus @xmath72 appears to be gaussian - like , except for small local fluctuations , after only about one - hundredth of an oscillator cycle . in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig2](b ) , we start with a gaussian with @xmath42 , with the same @xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to the stationary wave function in the absence of interatomic interaction . in a few oscillator cycles , the width narrows to a stationary value .",
    "if we initially choose @xmath40 near the stationary value , the location of the peak of @xmath72 will slowly oscillate about some mean position .",
    "[ aekhfig2](c ) shows the case when the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the peak location is minimized .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath73 , for this choice of @xmath1 .",
    "the wave function in this case is sensibly stationary , and the gaussian approximation is good .    in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig3 ] , we plot the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the peak location for @xmath59 ( just below critical ) against @xmath58 , and exhibit the minimum at @xmath74 , as quoted earlier in ( [ alpha ] ) . for a quantitative measure of",
    "how good the gaussian approximation is , we calculate the absolute value of the overlap between @xmath75 and @xmath76 and find that it lies between 1 and 0.9795 , with an average of 0.9906 , for @xmath12 between 0 and 50 ( @xmath12 in units of 2@xmath77 ) .",
    "to find @xmath22 , we examine the time development for different @xmath1 , to look for the onset of local collapse .",
    "the signature of the collapse is the occurrence of a minimum in the wave function within a small distance from the origin as shown in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig4 ] for @xmath74 and @xmath78 .",
    "the initial wave function is stationary for a while , but begins to narrow after @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ aekhfig4](a ) ) , and a dip occurs at @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ aekhfig4](b ) ) , at @xmath81 , which describes the implosion of a shell of particles at that radius .",
    "the first local minimum moves inwards with time and it eventually gets very close to @xmath48 , at @xmath82 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig4](c ) .",
    "the density in the inner region can grow only by taking particles from the outside , since the number of particles is conserved .",
    "an examination of the phase of the wave function , whose gradient gives the superfluid velocity , shows that the superfluid velocity has a peak at the dip , and is directed inward , as we expect from the continuity equation .",
    "thus , qualitatively , the onset of collapse happens on a time scale an order of magnitude greater than that for the establishment of the initial wave function , and it is initiated by a sudden inward rush of particles from a finite distance from the center .",
    "this signals the formation of a `` black hole '' , as suggested by ueda and huang @xcite .    after the onset of collapse , the density in the black hole increases rapidly , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig4](c ) .",
    "the increase is fueled by particles drawn from throughout the outer region , but the density outside does not decrease uniformly . instead , there are ripples of small implosions this is illustrated in the 3d plot of fig .",
    "[ aekhfig5 ] , with @xmath72 plotted above the @xmath46-@xmath83 plane",
    ". the black hole formation is indicated by the sudden rise of @xmath72 near the origin .",
    "the terrain is smooth before the rise , but very rough after that .",
    "the uneven bumps in the terrain are of course deterministic , but they are very sensitive to variations in the initial wave function , and in this sense they are random ( see fig .  [ aekhfig6 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the height of the plateau seems to remain constant in time is an artifact of the finite spatial grid size .",
    "the height appears to increase without bound in the continuum limit , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig8 ] .    to determine @xmath22 more precisely , we plot the occurrence time of the first local minimum in the wave function within distance @xmath84 from the origin , as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig7 ] , for a gaussian initial wave function with @xmath86 , and for an optimal gaussian initial wave function with @xmath74 .",
    "the results are as follows : @xmath87 which conforms to our expectation that the numbers are not very sensitive to initial conditions , because the time for the onset of collapse is long compared to the formation time of a quasi - stationary wave function .    in fig .",
    "[ aekhfig8 ] we show the dependence of some of our results on the spatial grid size .",
    "the time for the onset of collapse appears to tend to a finite limit when the grid size approaches zero , but the height of a peak in the collapsed region seems to grow without bound , faster than ( grid size)@xmath88 .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that density fluctuations become divergent in the continuum limit .",
    "we have ignored gain - loss mechanisms so far , because we wanted to understand various effects one at a time .",
    "now we shall take them into account , and make the problem more realistic .    in the experimental situation , the condensate in the trap can exchange atoms with an uncondensed `` thermal cloud '' , which contains far more atoms than the condensate .",
    "equilibrium is reached when the chemical potentials equalize .",
    "the equilibrium fraction of condensate to `` cloud '' atoms is determined by the temperature .",
    "the kinetic equations governing the approach to equilibrium are quite intricate , and a subject of ongoing research @xcite .",
    "we shall use a phenomenological gain equation based on a fit to data @xcite :    @xmath89\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 is the equilibrium number of atoms in the condensate , with @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the elastic scattering rate , which is approximately equal to 1 s@xmath88 for the conditions of the experiment of ref.@xcite and @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 is a phenomenological factor to reconcile the above theoretical prediction for @xmath95 with the experimental results for the repulsive case @xcite . in our runs",
    "we used @xmath96 and @xmath97 nk , while @xmath98 was taken to be equal to the critical value of @xmath99 , i.e. about @xmath100 . assuming @xmath101 , we ignored the second term in the bracket .",
    "the main loss mechanisms are two- and three - body collisions@xcite described by the following equation :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the particle density in the condensate . adding the gain and loss terms , we have an extended nlse , which reads , in units such that @xmath104 ,    @xmath105    where @xmath106 in ref.@xcite , the value of @xmath107 is taken to be of order @xmath108 , which differs considerably from ours .    with the new equation , we find that the initial conditions become quite irrelevant .",
    "the number of particles quickly settle into a steady - state oscillation whose peak value defines the critical particle number in the new context .",
    "this is shown in fig.9 , with : @xmath109 the mean number of atoms is approximately 735 , and the period of the oscillation is @xmath110 the long time scale of the oscillations explains why they are insensitive to initial conditions .",
    "we have extended the calculations to the longest evolution time practicable , and found that , with a constant supply of particles , @xmath1 oscillates in a steady state for at least 1.44@xmath111 trap cycles , or 100 seconds .",
    "these results are comparable with those obtained by hulet et al .",
    "@xcite , except that , in contrast to our case , @xmath1 collapses to zero in that calculation .",
