    "both the shortest path problem and the min - cut problem are of great importance to various kinds of network routing applications ( e.g. , in transportation networks , optical networks , etc . ) . a traffic request can be routed in the most efficient way ( e.g. , with minimum delay ) by computing a shortest path . on the other hand ,",
    "the min - cut problem arises in the context of network reliability , network throughput , etc .",
    "fortunately , both of these problems are solvable in polynomial time for networks with independent additive link weights .    however , often correlations or ( inter-)dependencies exist among link weights .",
    "for example , in overlay @xcite or multilayer networks @xcite , the abstract links in the logical layer are mapped to different links in the physical layer . in this context , two or more abstract links , which use the same physical links , may have correlated latencies @xcite , bandwidth usage @xcite , or geographical failures @xcite , @xcite . or if the path must pass through some specific nodes ( e.g. , regenerators to boost the signal quality @xcite ) , such important nodes and their links may also introduce dependencies .",
    "correlations also appear in social networks .",
    "for instance , a message may be forwarded more rapidly if it came from a close friend rather than from a distant acquaintance .",
    "another example relates to interdependent networks @xcite , where for instance the electricity network and internet are coupled and inter - connected , and one node or link failure in one network may cause failures of nodes or links in the other network . similarly in shared - risk link group ( srlg ) networks @xcite , links in , for example , the same duct will fail simultaneously , if their duct fails .",
    "the dependencies in interdependent and srlg networks can also be seen as correlations , so we use the term correlation throughout this paper and study relevant problems in these so - called correlated networks .",
    "our key contributions are as follows :    * we propose two correlated link weight models , namely a _ deterministic correlated model _ and a _",
    "stochastic correlated model_. * we study the shortest path problem and the min - cut problem under the deterministic correlated model , and we prove that both of them are np - hard and even can not be approximated in polynomial time . * on the other hand , we also show that both the shortest path problem and the min - cut problem are solvable in polynomial time under a ( constrained ) nodal deterministic correlated model . * to solve both problems under the proposed correlated models , we propose exact algorithms under the deterministic correlated model , and develop convex optimization formulations for the stochastic correlated model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : corremodels ] introduces our two correlated link weight models . in section [ sec : correrouting ] and section  [ sec : correcut ] , we study the shortest path problem and min - cut problem , respectively , for the proposed models and devise algorithms to solve them exactly .",
    "an overview of the related work is presented in section  [ sec : correrelwork ] and we conclude in section  [ sec : correconclusion ] .",
    "a network having node and link weights can be transformed into a directed network with only link weights , as done in @xcite . therefore , we assume nodes are unweighted and only consider correlated link weights . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the term `` correlated model '' to represent `` correlated link weight model '' .      without loss of generality",
    ", we use @xmath0 to represent the weight of link @xmath1 . for simplicity , in this paper we call @xmath0 the cost of @xmath1 , although it could also reflect other metrics such as delay , energy , etc . in the deterministic correlated model , for any two links @xmath2 and @xmath3 , their joint total cost is represented by @xmath4 , where the operator @xmath5 indicates the joint total cost of the links , which may differ from the @xmath6 operator when they are _",
    "correlated_. when correlated , the use of one link may influence the cost of another in this model . for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nondom ] where the cost is shown above each link , it is assumed that only links @xmath7 and @xmath8 are correlated with joint cost of @xmath9 , and all the other links have uncorrelated costs .",
    "we can see that in path @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 , the cost of link @xmath8 is @xmath13 , since another link @xmath14 in this path is not correlated with it .",
    "therefore this path s cost is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "however , in path @xmath10-@xmath16-@xmath11-@xmath12 , the cost of link @xmath8 should be calculated together with link @xmath7 , leading to a joint cost @xmath9 , since they are correlated and both appear in this path .",
    "therefore , this path s total cost is equal to @xmath17 , which is smaller than the sum of the individual link costs ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "equivalently , we could formulate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 stands for the correlation coefficient between links @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and its value varies in the range of @xmath21 , since we do not consider negative costs .",
    "when @xmath20 is equal to @xmath22 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are uncorrelated , when @xmath20 is greater than @xmath22 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have an increasing correlation , and otherwise we say that @xmath2 and @xmath3 have a decreasing correlation .",
    "analogously , for given @xmath23 links @xmath24 in the deterministic correlated model , their joint total cost can be expressed as follows : @xmath25 similarly , if the link @xmath1 s weight is multiplicative ( e.g. , failure probability ) , then by using @xmath26 to represent its weight value , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumcorrelated ] ) also applies .",
    "the decreasing correlation case can also reflect srlg networks .",
    "for instance , in srlg networks , each link is associated with several srlg events with their respective failure probabilities .",
    "hence , the total failure probability ( represented by @xmath27 ) of two correlated links that have at least one srlg in common will be equal to the product of the failure probabilities of all the distinct srlg events that belong to these two links .",
    "let us denote @xmath28 and @xmath29 as the failure probabilities of these two links , respectively , where @xmath30 denotes the common srlgs failure probability between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the non - overlapping srlgs failure probability of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 )",
    ". then @xmath35 . by taking the @xmath36",
    ", we have :    @xmath37 or equivalently , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes their correlation coefficient . in probability theory ,",
    "given two random variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 with expected values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and standard deviations @xmath44 and @xmath45 , their _ linear _ correlation coefficient @xmath46 is defined as : @xmath47}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}=\\frac{e[(x-\\mu_x)(y-\\mu_y)]}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 $ ] represents the covariance of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "however , the _ linear _ correlation coefficient in probability theory is different from and can not be transformed to the one defined in the deterministic correlated model , because : the variances of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbcorrecoe ] ) must be nonzero and finite .",
    "however , in the deterministic correlated model , for any link @xmath1 , when none of its correlated links simultaneously appear on a path , the cost of @xmath1 is fixed / deterministic with variance of @xmath49 .      in many real - life networks ,",
    "the link weights are uncertain because of inaccurate network state information ( nsi ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , papagiannaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the queuing delay distribution can be approximated by a weibull distribution .",
    "since the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of a weibull distribution is log - concave and the cdfs of many common distributions ( e.g. , exponential distribution , uniform distribution , etc . ) are log - concave @xcite , we make , as in @xcite , a mild ( general ) assumption that the link weights follow a log - concave distribution .",
    "we first define the _ correlated group _ ( cg ) :    given is a network @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents a set of @xmath52 nodes and @xmath53 denotes a set of @xmath54 links .",
    "a correlated group ( cg ) is a subset of links @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , such that @xmath1 and @xmath58 are correlated ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "accordingly , the maximum correlated group ( mcg ) is defined as a cg with the maximum number of correlated links .",
    "if a link @xmath1 is uncorrelated / independent with all the other links , then we say @xmath60 is a single element mcg .",
    "suppose there are @xmath61 maximum correlated groups ( mcgs ) , and there are @xmath62 links ( denoted as @xmath63 , @xmath64, ... ,@xmath65 ) in the @xmath66-th mcg , where @xmath67 . in the @xmath66-th mcg , a multivariate @xmath68-dimensional log - concave cumulative density function @xmath69 is given to allocate cost @xmath70 , @xmath71 , ... ,",
    "@xmath72 for links @xmath63 , @xmath64 , ... ,",
    "@xmath65 , respectively .    therefore ,",
    "if the possible cost of link @xmath1 ranges from @xmath49 to @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , then the probability of allocating a cost value out of this range is @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath75 for a single element mcg @xmath66 , and @xmath76 for a multi - element mcg @xmath77 .    for example ,",
    "[ fig : cvxcdf ] shows a 2-dimensional multivariate normal distribution , where both variables are in the range @xmath78 $ ] with mean @xmath79 and covariance matrix @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbcorrecoe ] ) , the correlation matrix ( composed of linear correlation coefficients ) can be derived from the covariance matrix and the variables standard variances in the multivariate normal distribution .",
    "however , we do not explicitly use the _ linear _ correlation coefficient in the stochastic correlated model , since we will later prove that via the log - concave property of this model , the shortest path problem can be solved by convex optimization .",
    "given is a directed network @xmath50 , and each link @xmath81 has a cost @xmath0 following the deterministic correlated model .",
    "the shortest path under the deterministic correlated model ( spdcm ) problem is to find a path from a source @xmath10 to a destination @xmath12 with minimum cost .    in conventional deterministic networks ,",
    "a subpath of a shortest path is also the shortest .",
    "we refer to this property as the dominance of the subpath . however , this is not the case in networks with deterministic correlated link weights , which means a dominated path may also lead to an optimal solution . for instance , in the example of fig . [",
    "fig : nondom ] , we can see that although subpath @xmath10-@xmath11 has a smaller cost than subpath @xmath10-@xmath16-@xmath11 , path @xmath10-@xmath16-@xmath11-@xmath12 ( instead of path @xmath10-@xmath11-@xmath12 ) has minimum cost . in the following",
    ", we will study the complexity of the spdcm problem .",
    "[ theo : spdcm_np ] the spdcm problem is np - hard .    when the correlation coefficient is equal to @xmath22 , the spdcm problem can be solved in polynomial time by a conventional shortest path algorithm .",
    "we therefore prove in the following that the spdcm problem is np - hard for `` increasing correlation''@xmath82 as well as `` decreasing correlation''@xmath83 .    * increasing correlation * :    when the correlation coefficient is greater than @xmath22 , we make a reduction to the forbidden pairs shortest path problem , which is known to be np - hard  @xcite . in a given network and for a given set of node pairs @xmath84",
    ", the forbidden pairs shortest path problem looks for the shortest path between @xmath10 and @xmath12 such that at most one node from each pair in the set @xmath84 lies on this path .",

    "the link costs are uncorrelated and finite . since @xmath85 , if the two forbidden nodes appear in the same path then the cost of this path will be @xmath88 , so it will never lead to the shortest path . now , the spdcm problem is equivalent to the forbidden pairs shortest path problem .    *",
    "decreasing correlation * :    when the correlation coefficient is less than @xmath22 , we make a reduction to the minimum color single - path ( mcsip ) problem , which is np - hard @xcite . given a network @xmath50 , and given the set of colors @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the total number of colors , and given the color set @xmath91 associated to each link @xmath92 , the minimum color single - path ( mcsip ) problem is to find one path from source node @xmath10 to destination node @xmath12 such that it uses the least amount of colors .",
