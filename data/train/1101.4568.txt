    "lhc experiments provide the unique opportunity to explore some exotic states of heavy quarks . among them , particularly interesting states are those four - quark states consisting of double heavy quarks and double light antiquarks ( or their charge conjugator ) .",
    "the existence of such states can be inferred from the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the double heavy quarks in the color anti - triplet state may form a diquark cluster by the attractive strong interactions . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the double heavy quarks move slowly in a small relative velocity @xmath1 in the rest frame within a smaller distance ( @xmath2 ) , comparing to the size of light degree of freedom ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus in the tetraquark states the double heavy quarks form a color anti - triplet diquark cluster .",
    "it contributes the color interactions to double light antiquarks as a color source of a heavy antiquark .",
    "the other two light antiquarks move around it with attractive interactions between them .",
    "the dynamics of the light degrees of freedom of these tetraquark states are similar with those of the heavy baryons .",
    "the picture is supported by scrutinizing the typical sizes of real hadrons .",
    "the size of the heavy quarkonium is around @xmath4 fm while that of the light hadrons is around @xmath5 fm .",
    "the masses of such states can be roughly estimated as the sum of two heavy quarks masses and @xmath6 .",
    "for the tetraquark states containing the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 quarks , their masses are around 3.4 gev , 6.8 gev , and 10.2 gev , respectively .",
    "the flavor features of this sort of hadrons are very different from the conventional hadrons . once they are discovered in experiments",
    ", it will be an undoubted evidence for the existence of the tetraquark states .",
    "some theoretical studies on these states were presented in literatures@xcite .",
    "the spin of a tetraquark state is a composition of the spins of the four quarks and the relative orbital angular momenta between them . for @xmath10waves , all orbital angular momenta",
    "then the spin of the tetraquark state is just the composition of the spin of each quark or antiquark .",
    "the composition of the spins of double heavy quarks may be 0 or 1 .",
    "however , when two heavy quarks are identical , only spin 1 state is allowed due to the antisymmetry by exchanging identical fermions .",
    "it is also the same case for the light antiquarks sector . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in only the tetraquark states with all orbital angular momenta vanishing .",
    "we denote states by @xmath11 ( @xmath12=0 , 1 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent their heavy flavor indexes and @xmath12 is the spin of the double heavy quarks subsystem .    as bound states with quite large masses they are difficult to be produced at usual high energy machines .",
    "nevertheless , at lhc , they can be produced efficiently via a direct production process which involves effects happened at several distinct distance scales .",
    "firstly , two heavy quark - antiquark pairs are produced via gluon - gluon fusion hard subprocess at distance scale @xmath15 or shorter .",
    "secondly , for those produced two heavy quarks with small relative velocity @xmath1 there are certain probabilities to form a color anti - triplet diquark cluster at distance scale @xmath2 .",
    "finally the diquark cluster evolves into the tetraquark state via the fragmentation process by picking up two light antiquarks from the vacuum at the distance scale @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the hadronic production cross sections of @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath12=0 , 1 ) , and @xmath18 via gluon - gluon fusion process at lhc .",
    "our results show that a number of these particles can be produced .",
    "we also point out the signatures to detect those particles .",
    "the rest of the paper are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the calculation of the subprocess @xmath19 . sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] devotes to the numerical results of the cross sections of the tetraquark states at lhc and at tevatron . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we give some discussions about the results and the signals in the detectors .",
    "as mentioned above , in the production process of the tetraquark states @xmath21 , there are three hierarchy distance scales , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly , the cross sections of the subprocesses for the production of the @xmath10wave tetraquark states , @xmath23 , can be factored into three different parts accounting for physical effects happening at those distinct distance scales : @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath18 and @xmath16 ; @xmath29 is the squared invariant mass of the double gluons ; @xmath30 is the lorentz invariant three - body phase space integral element ; @xmath31 is the short - distance coefficient describing the production rate of the color anti - triplet point - like @xmath32 state at the energy scale @xmath33 or higher ; @xmath34 is the wave function at the origin of the @xmath10wave diquark state ; @xmath35 is the fragmentation function of the diquark into the color - singlet tetraquark state @xmath23 .",
    "the short - distance coefficient can be calculated by perturbative qcd and can be expanded in terms of @xmath36 at the short - distance energy scale @xmath33 or higher .",
    "the rest parts are non - perturbative effects in nature .",
    "to estimate the production cross sections , one needs to determine their numerical values .",
    "the formation of the diquark cluster from the free double heavy quarks is described by the wave function at the origin .",
    "their numerical values can be estimated by the potential model .",
    "the diquark cluster provides an anti - triplet color source as a heavy antiquark .",
    "thus , in the heavy quark limit , its fragmentation probability for forming the tetraquark states can then be approximately described by that for forming the heavy baryons by a heavy quark .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the cross sections of hadronic production of the @xmath10wave states , @xmath16 , @xmath27 , @xmath37 , and @xmath18 , at lhc .",
    "we compute the tree level short - distance coefficients @xmath38 in the leading order @xmath39 using perturbation qcd . by estimating the nonperturbative matrix elements , we carry out the numerical calculations of the total cross sections .",
    "our results show that a number of these particles can be produced .",
    "we first calculate the short - distance coefficients @xmath40 at the tree level .",
    "they are proportional to the squared matrix elements @xmath41 .",
    "to calculate the matrix elements , one needs to calculate the subprocess of @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 moving in the same @xmath45velocity and in the color anti - triplet state . at the tree level , the production processes involve 36 feynman diagrams for @xmath46 , and 72 ones for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the amplitudes can be classified as six gauge - invariant subsets in terms of six independent color bases . given this ,",
    "the calculations of the amplitudes as well as their squares are straightforward .",
    "@xmath34 s are the wave functions at the origin of the s - wave diquark clusters .",
    "their precise values are difficult to be gained since the large range interaction potential between the double heavy quarks in the color anti - triplet state is not very clear while the short range one is dominated be coulomb potential . reasonably , we take values predicted by solving schdinger equation with coulomb potential , @xmath49 .",
    "then the predicted @xmath50 s are 0.143 , 0.0382 , and 0.0198 gev@xmath51 for @xmath9 , @xmath52 , and @xmath7 diquark systems , respectively . including the confinement part ,",
    "the wave function is squeezed to the central region and hence the wave function at the origin will be enhanced .",
    "actually , we have done numerical calculations for the diquark state by solving the schrdinger equation using coulomb potential plus the linear potential fixed in the color - singlet case , the numerical value of wave function at the origin is enhanced by 10% - 30% . more reliable prediction for this nonperturbative number can be obtained by some nonperturbative method like lattice qcd .",
    "we now turn to the fragmentation function of @xmath53-cluster to a tetraquark state .",
    "as discussed above , the produced heavy diquark cluster in the color anti - triplet state provides the same color source as the heavy antiquark to the light antiquarks in the limit of the ratio of size of the diquark over that of the light antiquarks in the tetraquark state .",
    "thus the fragmentation probabilities to produce the tetraquark states @xmath11 from the heavy diquarks are the same with that to produce the heavy baryons from the heavy quarks .",
    "let s take a qed example to illustrate it .",
    "imagine the hydrogen ion or deuterium ion passing material .",
    "the probabilities forming the hydrogen atom or the deuterium one are the same if the velocities of both ions are the same since they possess the same electric charge . the fragmentation function is defined in the framework of the infinity momentum where the parton moves in the speed of light .",
    "the fragmentation functions to produce the tetraquark states are nonperturbative in nature .",
    "thus the shapes of them can only be described by certain phenomenological models @xcite .",
    "one of the most commonly used models is the peterson model@xcite , in which the fragmentation function takes the following form : @xmath54 ^ 2 } , d_{\\bar{3}}\\to { t_{q_1q_2}^{i}}(x)=\\frac{n}{x[1-(1/x)-\\epsilon_{q_1q_2}/(1-x)]^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the only parameter determining the shape of the fragmentation function ; @xmath56 is the normalization constant .",
    "once the fragmentation probability to produce the tetraquark state r is given , @xmath56 is fixed by the following condition : @xmath57    the fragmentation probabilities of @xmath58 and @xmath59 have been measured in @xmath60 collisions @xcite . according to pdg 2006 @xcite , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "these results are about 0.1 .",
    "therefore as a good approximation we may take the fragmentation probability of @xmath63 , the value of @xmath64 in eq.([nor - sub ] ) , be 0.1 .    from eqs.([frag - sub ] ) and ( [ nor - sub ] ) we know the normalization constant @xmath56 in the peterson model is dependent on the parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the model suggested a scaling behavior for the parameter @xmath65 that is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 determined by experiments is about @xmath68 @xcite . using the scaling behavior and taking @xmath67 to be 0.004",
    ", we predict that @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the corresponding normalization constants are 0.0075 , 0.0194 , 0.0047 . here",
    "we take @xmath72 gev , @xmath73 gev and @xmath74 .",
    "the fragmentation functions are energy scale dependent .",
    "their convolution from one energy scale to another satisfies dglap equation .",
    "however , for the hadronic production of the tetraquark states at lhc , the production is dominated by the smaller @xmath75 region of the produced particles , i.e. , compatible with the tetraquark masses . for smaller @xmath75 production of the tetraquark state",
    ", there are no distinguishable energy scale differences .",
    "thus the evolution of the fragmentation function used here is not significant .",
    "therefore , in the numerical calculations we can take the fragmentation functions with the initial energy scale to be the tetraquark mass without evolution .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of the total cross sections with @xmath76 of the subprocess given in eq .",
    "( [ cs - sub ] ) . according to the parton model",
    ", the cross sections of the processes @xmath77 , can be expressed as :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the factorization energy scale , @xmath75 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath11 , and @xmath80 is the distribution function of the gluon in the proton .",
    "here we use the cteq6l @xcite parton distribution function .",
    "there is an uncertainty in the calculations arising from the choice of the factorization energy scale @xmath79 . here for comparison , we take two different values of @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82/2 , where @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the transverse momentum of the diquark . with the choices of these factorization energy scales and",
    "@xmath36 given in @xcite for the cteq6l @xcite parton distribution function , we calculate the total cross sections in cms , atlas and lhcb with the invariant mass of the @xmath85 system , @xmath86 tev and 14 tev , respectively .",
    "the numerical results of the total production cross sections are listed in tables [ cross14tev ] and [ cross7tev ] .",
    "the @xmath75 and the rapidity distributions are shown in figs.[cmscut]-[7ycut ] . from tables",
    "[ cross14tev ] and [ cross7tev ] , we see that the total cross section to produce @xmath16 without @xmath87cut is much larger than the one with @xmath88 gev .",
    "this can be explained with two reasons , i.e. , the small peak value in the @xmath75 distribution of the subprocess @xmath89 and the shape of fragmentation function of @xmath90cluster .",
    "they also result in the lines of the @xmath87distributions across in figs.([cmscut ] ) , ( [ lhccut ] ) , ( [ 7cmscut ] ) , and ( [ 7lhccut ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tevatron ]    from table [ tevatron ] , we see that for @xmath91 integrated luminosity running at @xmath92 tev , for the production of @xmath93 , around @xmath94 events at tevatron can be accumulated with kinematic cuts @xmath95 gev and @xmath96 . for the production of @xmath97 , again by adding both @xmath98 and @xmath99 events together , we see that for @xmath91 integrated luminosity , for the production of @xmath97 , around @xmath100 events at tevatron can be accumulated with kinematic cuts @xmath95 gev and @xmath96 . for the production of @xmath101 , around @xmath102 events at tevatron can be accumulated with kinematic cuts @xmath95 gev and @xmath96 .    there are some uncertainties in the predicted numerical results .",
    "one arises from the ambiguity in choosing the factorization energy scale @xmath79 . from the tables",
    ", we see that two different values of @xmath79 lead to around and less than factor 2 difference in the cross section .",
    "the next leading order result will reduce this uncertainty .",
    "however , it will be very hard calculation .",
    "another one arises from the wave function at the origin , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , it will increase the cross sections by 20 - 70 % including the linear confinement potential between the heavy quark .",
    "moreover , all excited heavy diquark states will decay into the ground diquark states by emitting photons or @xmath103 s . including those contributions ,",
    "the production cross sections may be enhanced by 2 - 3 times .    comparing the @xmath75 distributions at lhc and tevatron , we see that the differential cross sections decrease faster at tevatron than at lhc with the @xmath75 increase .",
    "in calculating the accumulated events number , we take the integrated luminosity as the corresponding collider running at present or planning luminosity for about one year . from the above discussions , we see that the predicted event number of the tetraquark at the tevatron is about 3 - 4 orders of magnitude lower than that at lhc with @xmath104 tev for one year .",

    "some other useful decays for identifying those tetraquark states are those 3-body or 4-body nonleptonic decays .    considering the signatures and the efficiencies of the the detectors",
