    "excitations of the phonon field around the ground state @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the transverse and the longitudinal modes respectively . for a chosen vacuum @xmath26",
    "we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{0\\leq\\omega_q^{l , t , t}\\leq\\omega_{\\rm d}}[\\pi_q^{1}\\pi_{-q}^{1}+\\pi_q^{2}\\pi_{-q}^{2}+\\pi_q^{3}\\pi_{-q}^{3}]+\\\\ \\sum_{0\\leq\\omega_q^l\\leq\\omega_{\\rm",

    "in particular , this hamiltonian predicts that heat capacity at constant volume per particle @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) drops down from approximately @xmath32 to about @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the effective hamiltonian has a neat property regarding the low - frequency transverse phonon excitations in the _ rigid_/compressed liquid regime ( see the last term in eq .",
    "[ ham ] ) , i.e. low - frequency wave - packets ( long - wavelength limit ) can not be propagated in the _ rigid liquids _ due to the existence of the transverse phononic gaps in the spectrum ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the inability to support low - frequency transverse elementary collective excitations ( low - energy cutoff ) is a manifestation of the absence of the long - range order structural correlations in liquids ( see dac experiments ) and _ vice versa_. an increase in temperature leads to the disappearance of both the high - frequency transverse phonon modes ( @xmath36 , hence , @xmath37 : @xmath38 ) @xcite and progressively the medium - range order pair correlations @xcite .",
    "@xmath39 ( @xmath40 , see eq .",
    "[ ham ] ) is the new thermodynamic limit ( dubbed here the frenkel line thermodynamic limit ) along with other well - known @xmath41 ( the dulong - petit law ) and @xmath42 ( the ideal gas ) thermodynamic limits which are also covered by eq . [ ham ] .",
    "therefore , crossing the frenkel line results in fundamental changes of pair structural correlations both in reciprocal and real spaces @xcite , as well as in the thermodynamics ( heat capacity at constant volume @xmath37 ) , scaling laws @xcite , and phonon states in the supercritical matter @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the liquid energy can be calculated on the basis of pair correlations @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density , @xmath45 is the interatomic potential , and @xmath46 is the pair distribution function which can also be represented as a fourier transform of the static structure factor @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the first approach ( see eq . [ ham ] ) takes into account the phonon contributions into the internal energy of a liquid . as temperature increases ( @xmath36 ) the internal energy and the heat capacity approach the frenkel line thermodynamic limit meaning that @xmath48 . on the other hand , from the second equivalent approach",
    "[ gas ] ) , the internal energy with temperature increase loses the contribution from the medium range pair correlations which can be evidenced from disappearance of the 2@xmath49 @xmath46 or @xmath47 peaks .",
    "thus , @xmath48 . therefore , dynamic , structural and thermodynamic crossovers are interconnected within the liquid and the supercritical state and governed by temperature variations , hence , negligibly influenced by the pressure in terms of the described analysis .",
    "it is noteworthy , that any approach what bears a `` small parameter '' and makes it possible to expand the energy of the system into the series , for example such as virial expansion , meyer expansion , percus - yevick approach , hard - sphere model and other perturbation approaches are capable to describe weakly interacting systems , by the definition . as a result",
    ", these approaches fail in describing the systems with strong interactions like compressed liquids .",
    "hence , these methods are unable to predict and describe the structural crossover between compressed and non - compressed liquid regimes which is described above and the subject of this work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the limiting case of no interaction , the system behaves as an ideal gas and the structure factor is completely featureless : @xmath50 .",
    "there is no correlation between the positions @xmath51 and @xmath52 of different particles ( they are independent random variables ) so the sum over the off - diagonal terms in equation @xmath53 vanishes , i.e. @xmath54\\rangle = \\langle \\exp ( -i \\mathbf{q } \\mathbf{r}_j ) \\rangle \\langle \\exp ( i \\mathbf{q } \\mathbf{r}_k ) \\rangle = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even for interacting particles at high magnitudes of the scattering vector @xmath55 , the structure factor goes to 1 .",
    "this result follows from equation    @xmath56    since @xmath57 is the fourier transform of the @xmath46 and thus goes to zero for high values of the argument @xmath5 .",
    "this reasoning does not hold for a perfect crystal , where the distribution function exhibits infinitely peaks . to examine the temperature changes of @xmath47 in more detail ( see fig .",
    "[ figfo]a ) , we show temperature variation of the heights and positions of the first and second peaks of @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ figfo](b  d ) .",
    "there is a steep decrease of both peaks at high temperature , fig .",
    "[ figfo](b , c ) , followed by their flattening at high temperature , with the crossover between the two regimes taking place around 1500 k. the crossover is visible in the insets of fig .",
    "[ figfo](b , c ) where we plot the temperature derivative of the heights of both peaks .",
    "these plots clearly show two structural regimes corresponding to the fast and slow changes of the @xmath47 peaks and their positions .",
    "the structural crossover in the reciprocal space of supercritical state at elevated temperatures which we observe in figs .",
    "[ figfo](b  d ) , supports the experimental results from the main text .",
    "it should be noted , that the observed crossover is not related to the melting line , as the @xmath47 profile of the ar solid phase ( well - ordered phase ) would exhibit very clear sharp peaks throughout the @xmath5-range covered by md simulations .",
    "in contrast , the 1@xmath58 and the 2@xmath49 s(q ) peaks become wider and weaken with temperature increase signifying the strong disorder .",
    "the structural crossover is further evidenced by the calculation of mean force potential ( mfp ) , self - diffusion and first coordination shell parameters that include the first shell coordination number , the height and the first @xmath46 peak position at different temperatures ( see fig .  [ figfi ] ) .",
    "the temperature variations of the system properties are manifested in both real ( fig .",
    "[ figfi ] ) and reciprocal ( fig .",
    "[ figfo](b  d ) ) spaces .",
    "various methods have been proposed for calculating the mfp .",
    "the simplest representation of the mfp is the separation @xmath59 between two particles as the reaction coordinate .",
    "the mfp ( see fig .  [ figfi]a ) is related to the @xmath46 using the following expression for the helmholtz free energy @xcite @xmath60}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we use einstein s formula to calculate self - diffusion from the mean square distance ( msd ) travelled by a certain particle over a certain time interval . at the limit of infinite observation time",
    ", self - diffusion in terms of msd @xcite becomes @xmath61 ^ 2\\right>\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is displacement vector of the @xmath63-th atom at @xmath29 time and the term @xmath64 ^ 2 $ ] is the msd .",
    "the relationship between system properties in the real and reciprocal spaces is of prime interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is widely recognised that such a relationship may exist in some classes of systems but not in others . in this work ,",
    "the dac experiments and md simulations show that not only the supercritical state is physically non - uniform but also that manifestations of the non - uniformity are observed in both real and reciprocal spaces ( @xmath47 and @xmath46 peaks exhibit a `` zigzag '' behavior ) .",
    "we relate the structural crossovers in the supercritical state to changes in elementary collective excitations , power laws and thermodynamics in the crossing of the frenkel line . crossing",
    "the frenkel line corresponds to a quantitative change of the supercritical fluid s atomic structure and the transition of the substance from the compressed liquid structure to the non - compressed gas - like structure ( see figures [ figsoq]-[figgor ] and discussion below ) .",
    "the structural crossover takes place continuously when the liquid relaxation time @xmath65 ( the average time between two consecutive atomic jumps at one point in space @xcite ) approaches its minimal value @xmath66 , the debye vibrational period , upon which the system loses its ability to support high - frequency propagating shear modes with @xmath67 and behaves like a gas @xcite .",
    "when all shear modes are lost , only the longitudinal mode remains in the system and the heat capacity at constant volume becomes @xmath68 per particle @xcite .",
    "this result can be easily obtained from the phonon theory of liquids in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed thermodynamic boundary in the dac experiments is also closely related to both dynamic and thermodynamic crossovers existing in the supercritical state @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic boundary discovered in this work has several possible implications to astrobiology and the existence of alien life with the impact of extreme conditions on biomolecules @xcite .",
    "astonishingly , a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical co@xmath69 and can survive under severe conditions of pressure and temperature @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied structural properties of the supercritical co@xmath69 @xcite where we provided the evidence for the existence of persistent medium - range order correlations that make supercritical co@xmath69 nonuniform and heterogeneous on an intermediate length scale . in the first shell of the co@xmath69 cluster both carbon and oxygen atoms experience gas - like type correlations with short - range order interactions while within the second shell",
    ", oxygen atoms essentially exhibit a liquid - like type of correlations due to localization of transverse - like wave - packets .",
    "atoms inside the nearest - neighbor heterogeneity shell play a catalytic role providing a mechanism for diffusion on an intermediate length scale .",
    "extraterrestrial organisms might use these peculiar structural and thermodynamic advantageous properties of the supercritical co@xmath69 to survive biologically .",
    "other possibilities include exoplanets with 2 - 5 times the mass of the earth with stronger gravitational pulls ( super - earths ) and , thus , having supercritical atmospheres and/or oceans @xcite .",
    "therefore , further theoretical and experimental study of thermodynamics , dynamics and structure of various supercritical fluids and supercritical carbon dioxide in particular are in a strong demand .",
    "we believe that this discovery will boost the industrial use of supercritical fluids in more efficient way , assist us to search for other alternative conditions for an extraterrestrial fine - tuned life and also can lead to greater understanding in another disordered systems such as glasses and granular materials .    99    landau , l. d. @xmath70 lifshitz , e. m. _ statistical physics _ ( nauka , moscow , 1964 ) .",

    "<S> critical point occurs under conditions of specific values of temperature , pressure and composition , where no phase boundaries exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the substance approaches critical temperature , the properties of its gas and liquid phases converge , resulting in only one phase at and beyond the critical point  a homogeneous supercritical fluid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been experimentally established that the supercritical fluids are , in fact , dynamically non - homogeneous in the neighborhood of the critical point @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the supercritical state has recently been revised @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested to divide the supercritical state beyond the critical point and its neighborhood into two distinct domains by introducing the frenkel line in the framework of the unified phonon - based approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that moving from one domain to another in the supercritical state is accompanied by changes in particle dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the frenkel line separates these two regions beyond the critical point based on changes in phonon excitations , which defines the dynamic crossover @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite associated with the crossing of the frenkel line have been theoretically predicted . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the predicted structural and thermodynamic crossovers are closely related to fundamental changes in phonon states @xcite , providing new unexpected connections between elementary collective excitations and the structure @xcite , thermodynamics and scaling laws of supercritical state @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report results from a diffraction experiment on supercritical argon in a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) which enables the observation of structural transformations upon crossing the frenkel line . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions correspond to a new thermodynamic boundary on argon pressure - temperature diagram ( see fig .  [ diagram ] ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we explain the origin of the structural crossovers across the frenkel line in the framework of the phonon theory of liquids using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , and relate its origin to the change of thermodynamic properties of the supercritical state . </S>",
