    "porous media is typically simulated through percolation systems @xcite , and flow through a variety of models ranging from the idealized ant in a labyrinth @xcite to the very practical ones like convective tracer flow @xcite .    in the study of flow in percolation clusters",
    ", it has been hypohesize that transport properties may be related to some geometric property of the cluster .",
    "however , despite considerable effort @xcite such a geometric property relation has not been found @xcite . here , we argue that , for the particular case of convective tracer flow in percolation clusters , a connection exists between transport properties and the static properties of a model of optimal paths in disordered lattices , described in detail below .",
    "this relation allows for a mapping between the two problems that opens new approaches for their study .",
    "the first hint of a possible connection between flow in porous media and the optimal path problem arouse in the work of lee et al .",
    "@xcite . this reference deals with a simplified model of flow in porous media related to secondary oil extraction , in which an invading fluid ( water , steam , etc . ) injected at @xmath9 pushes oil out through extraction well @xmath10 .",
    "this method is used when the oil reservoir does not have enough pressure to be exploited without this added driving pressure .",
    "the system is considered in the following way : the medium is modeled by a percolacion cluster at the critical threshold density , and a steady state laminar flow of an incompresible fluid is established between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then , tracers which mimick the flow of the driving fluid are injected at @xmath9 and travel purely by convection to @xmath10 ( sec .",

    "no turbulence or other complex fluid flow effects are considered , which is equivalent to assuming laminar flow inside the system .",

    "the total traveling length of a tracer is the number of bonds of the path connecting @xmath9 and @xmath10 , chosen by this tracer .",
    "since the particles do not interact with one another , it is equivalent to launching one particle at a time into the cluster .",

    "moreover , as @xmath1 increases , @xmath6 decreases and @xmath76 increases , indicating the differing behaviors for the two problems . in the next section",
    ", we explain the origin of the differences , how these differences can be removed , and under which conditions the two problems coincide .",
    "the numerical results presented above show the difference in the values of the scaling exponents @xmath6 and @xmath76 of the distributions . to understand these differences",
    ", we now elaborate on the characteristics of the optimal path problem in comparison to those of tracer paths in percolation .    in fig .",
    "[ schematic](a ) we represent the optimal path in strong disorder , where the dark areas represent regions with site weights @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and the white areas regions with site weigths @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "typically , the arbitrary choice of @xmath9 and @xmath10 may lead to a path connecting them that requires visiting regions with site weights @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast , the tracers inside percolation clusters must , by definition , travel on the _ same _ percolation cluster ( spanning or otherwise ) , because the flow takes place only if there is a percolating path between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , this difference between the flow and optimal path problems presents a possible explanation for the differences between @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "optimal paths tend to be longer because they are able to visit more sites of the lattice and are therefore of longer length , whereas tracers in percolation flow are confined to a given cluster , and their traveling lengths are much more limited .",
    "these features intuitively explain why @xmath76 is larger than @xmath6 .",
    "the above considerations lead to the following hypothesis : if the optimal path search is constrained to pairs of sites within regions of the lattice that are part of the same cluster [ fig .",
    "[ schematic](b ) ] , then the scaling of @xmath3 and @xmath8 would coincide . to test this , we present @xmath3 and @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ pl_pltr_perc ] , where the optimal paths satisfy the condition that their highest weight is at or below percolation .",
    "this condition forces the optimal paths to be inside percolation clusters . indeed ,",
    "for this case ( fig .",
    "[ pl_pltr_perc ] ) , the two quantities exhibit very similar behavior , supporting our hypothesis .",
    "the exponent @xmath6 inside percolation now becomes very close to @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath82 does not change , confirming the equivalence of the two problems .",
    "we also have similar results for three - dimensional lattices .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that @xmath3 has a power law tail with an exponent @xmath6 which decays as @xmath1 grows and is different from the power law tail of @xmath8 .",
    "this difference seems to be related to the fact that the optimal path crosses percolation clusters and thus tends to have longer lengths compared with tracers which are always inside percolation clusters .",
