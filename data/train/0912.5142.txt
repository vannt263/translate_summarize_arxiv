    "the skyrme model @xcite is an effective field theory of mesons and baryons in which baryons arise as topological soliton solutions , known as skyrmions .",
    "the model is based on the pre - qcd nonlinear @xmath0 model of the pion meson and was usually regarded to be consistent with the low - energy limit of large - n qcd@xcite . for this reason , among others",
    ", it has been extensively revisited in recent years anw , jr , sutcliffe , battye97,atiyah89,battye ( see , @xcite , for a review ) . owing to the high nonlinearity , the solution to the skyrme model was mainly studied through the numerical approach .",
    "it is worthwhile , however , to seek the analytic solutions @xcite of skyrmions due to its various applications in baryon phenomenology .",
    "one of noticeable analytic method for studying the skyrmion solutions is the instanton approach proposed by atiyah and manton@xcite which approximates critical points of the skyrme energy functional .    in this letter",
    ", we address the static solution of hedgehog skyrmion in the @xmath1 skyrme model without pion mass term and propose an analytical solution for the hedgehog skyrmion by writing it as the hybrid form of a kink - like solution and the analytic solution obtained by the instanton method @xcite .",
    "two lowest order of pad approximations was used and the corresponding solutions for skyrmion profile are given explicitly by using the downhill simplex method .",
    "the skyrmion mass and static properties of nucleon as well as delta was computed and compared to the previous results .",

    "using the hedgehog ansatz , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 are the three pauli matrices ) with @xmath16 depending merely on the radial coordinate @xmath17 , the static energy for ( [ sk ] ) becomes @xmath18 \\label{eden}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 a dimensionless variable and @xmath20 .",

    "the singularity at @xmath29 is gauge dependent and can be gauged away without affecting the value for the skyrme field .    to find the more accurate analytic solution",
    ", we first improve the solution ( [ kink ] ) into @xmath30 $ ] with @xmath31 a numeric factor and then take @xmath32 to be a @xmath33-dependent function : @xmath34 .",

    ", one can find the governing equation for the unknown @xmath37 by substituting ( [ fw ] ) into ( [ eom1 ] ) and obtain a series solution of @xmath38 by solving the governing equation . here , however , we choose the pad approximation to parameterize @xmath37@xmath39 since it has as equal potential as series in approximating a continuous function .",
    "note that we have already written @xmath37 as function of @xmath40 instead of @xmath33 since so is @xmath41 in ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the simplest nontrivial case of the above pad approximation is the [ 2/2 ] approximant @xmath42    the minimization of the energy ( [ eden ] ) with the trial function ( [ fw ] ) with respect to the variational parameters ( @xmath43 ) was carried out numerically for the [ 2/2 ] pad approximant ( [ 22 ] ) using the downhill simplex method ( the neilder - mead algorithm ) .",

    "we also include the analytic solutions given by @xcite and the solution in the form of the purely pad approximant @xcite for comparison . a quite well agreement of our solution with the numerical solution can be seen from this plot .",

    "the solution @xmath47 to the equation ( [ eom1 ] ) is given by @xmath49(see also @xcite , where the variable @xmath33 used is twice of @xmath33 in this paper ) while the analytic solution ( [ fw ] ) , when ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ para ] ) is used , behaves like @xmath50one can see that ( [ fwsmall ] ) agrees well with ( [ fsmall ] ) up to @xmath51 . for large @xmath52 the series solution for @xmath47",
    "can be obtained by solving ( [ eom1 ] ) with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath53 and using the series expansion for small @xmath54 . after re - changing @xmath54 to @xmath33 , one finds@xmath55on the other hand , the solution hyb(2/2 ) , at large @xmath33 , has the asymptotic form @xmath56which agrees globally with ( [ flarge ] ) except for a small bit differences .",
    "the detailed differences between ( [ flarge ] ) and ( [ fla ] ) at large @xmath33 can be due to the fact that the variationally - obtained solution ( [ fw ] ) approximates the skyrmion profile globally and may produce small errors in local region , for instance , @xmath57 while @xmath58",
    ".    the disagreement can be improved by employing the pad approximant of higher order than ( [ 22 ] ) , for example , the [ 4/4 ] approximant @xmath59 the minimization of ( [ eden ] ) using ( [ 44 ] ) , as done for the [ 2/2 ] approximant , yields the numerically optimal parameters , @xmath60 the solution ( [ fw ] ) with @xmath37 specified by ( [ 44 ] ) and ( p2 ) will be referred as the hyb(4/4 ) in this paper and is also plotted in .",

    "the computed skyrmion energies ( [ eden ] ) , measured in the unit of @xmath64 , are listed in , including the corresponding results obtained by the numeric solution and obtained in the relevant references as indicated .    in solving ( [ eom1 ] )",
    "numerically , we employ the nonlinear shoot algorithm for the boundary values at @xmath65 and @xmath66 based on the asymptotic formulas ( [ fsmall ] ) and ( [ flarge ] ) of the chiral angle @xmath47 .",

    "the resulted analytic solution ( [ fw ] ) has two remarkable features : ( 1 ) it is simple in the sense that it is globally given in whole region ; ( 2 ) it well approaches the asymptotic behavior of the exact solution .",
    "we note that the further generalization of ( [ fw ] ) , made by approximating @xmath31 in ( [ fw ] ) via pad approximation , does not exhibit remarkable improvement , particularly in the asymptotic behavior of the chiral angle @xmath47 at infinity .",
