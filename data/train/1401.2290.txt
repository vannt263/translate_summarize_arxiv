    "roughly speaking , a graph is an expander if it is sparse and at the same time well - connected .",

    "expander graphs have , e.g. , been used to construct certain classes of error correcting codes , in a proof of the pcp theorem ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , a deep result in computational complexity theory , and in the theory of metric embeddings .",
    "see , e.g. , the surveys @xcite and @xcite for these and other applications .    in recent years , the combinatorial study of simplicial complexes - considering them as a higher - dimensional generalization of graphs - has attracted increasing attention and the profitability of the concept of expansion for graphs has inspired the search for a corresponding higher - dimensional notion , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the expansion of a graph @xmath2 can be measured by the _ _ cheeger constant__often the cheeger constant is defined in a slightly different but closely related way , see section  [ sec : diffnotions ] . ] @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the set of edges with one endpoint in @xmath13 and the other in @xmath14 .",

    "this combinatorial notion of expansion is connected to the spectra of certain matrices associated with the graph : the adjacency matrix and the laplacian .",
