    "they are also the lightest fermions ever observed  in fact the smallness of neutrino masses can not be explained using the standard higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "all this indicates , that neutrinos are a window to some new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the possible electromagnetic properties of neutrinos in the form of an induced magnetic moment are particularly interesting , since the electromagnetic interactions are much easier to control in any precise measurement .",

    "@xcite a  basis independent classification of various diagrams leading to majorana neutrino masses has been presented .",

    "we have studied the majorana neutrino masses and transition magnetic moments using exact analytic formulas and up - to - date experimental data concerning neutrino oscillations and the non - observability of the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "our numerical procedure rested upon the assumption that most of the free parameters of the supersymmetric model unify in certain way at the gut scale @xmath2 .",
    "this allows to reduce the number of free parameters to few , and calculate the rest by performing renormalization group evolution .",
    "such approach gives a  much more convincing picture of the low energy spectrum than just assessing the running masses of the superparticles .",
    "we have also demonstrated the influence of the mixing among squarks and quarks on the results .",
    "the evident weak point of our approach was the lack of knowledge of the trilinear coupling constants , which forced us to use additional source of constraints ( neutrino oscillations , @xmath1 decay ) .",
    "in this paper we study the majorana neutrino transition magnetic moments generated in the @xmath0-parity violating modified minimal supergravity model .",
    "this model , based on the ref .",
    "@xcite , takes into account the full dependence of the renormalization group equations ( rge ) on the rpv couplings and their soft susy breaking versions .",

    "no other input , in particular experimental data , is needed .",

    "the neutral particles , like the neutral components of the higgs bosons , neutralinos and sneutrinos will contribute to the neutrino mass , but will not contribute to the magnetic moment , and as such will not be discussed here .    the paper is organized as follows . after the introduction , in sect .",

    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is the minimal extension of the standard model ( sm ) of particles and interactions , which introduces supersymmetry ( susy ) . in short , for each particle there is a  new superpartner ( fermionic for bosons and bosonic for fermions ) so that the number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in the mssm are equal .",
    "the one additional multiplet , not present in the sm , is a  second higgs doublet needed to cancel the gauge anomalies and to give masses to both the up and down components of the @xmath3 doublets .",
    "this version of the model preserves the so - called @xmath0-parity , which is a  multiplicative quantum number defined as @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the spin of the particle , @xmath6 the baryon , and @xmath7 the lepton number .",
    "one easily sees , that @xmath8 for ordinary standard model particles , while @xmath9 for the supersymmetric partners . preserving @xmath0 not only gives the baryon and lepton number conservations but also forbids decays of susy particles into sm particles , leaving the lightest susy particle stable .",
    "the problem of the lepton and baryon number conservation is still disputable . on one hand ,",
    "our observations suggest , that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are conserved quantum numbers .",
    "especially strong limits on @xmath6 violation come from the non - observation of the proton decay . on the other hand , in the sm not only the total lepton number but also generation lepton numbers @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are conserved , and this rule has been proven wrong after the discovery of neutrino oscillations . from the theoretical point of view , there is no underlying symmetry or mechanism , which supports conservation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which might suggest that it is only an accidental ( not exact ) symmetry present in the low - energy regime .",
    "it is generally expected , that the higher - energy extensions of the sm will not preserve at least the lepton number ( the proton stability must still hold ) .",
    "such models based on supersymmetry introduce new interactions , or in fact do not rule out certain terms , that should be present in the superpotential , which violate @xmath0-parity @xcite .",
    "they have a  much richer phenomenology and predict lots of new phenomena , like the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay , rpv loop - corrected neutrino mass and magnetic moment , and others .",

    "this clearly shows , that the loops with heaviest particles ( like higgsinos and charginos ) tend to dominate the overall contribution to the magnetic moments .",
    "this result is not totally unexpected , but it was not fully clear , if the higher order process ( amplitude proportional to four instead of two coupling constants ) will not suppress the effect coming directly from the masses of the heavy particles .",
    "that was the case when the neutrino  neutralino mixing placed two mass insertions on the external neutrino lines of the diagrams . here , however , the mass dependent loop functions @xmath99 are capable to boost the amplitudes of the process to very high values .",
    "all this holds also for the second , high , set of input parameters , although there the difference between smallest value of @xmath147 and the maximum trilinear contribution is ` only ' two orders of magnitude .",
    "the full contribution to the majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment consists of three main parts . the first one is represented by loop diagrams with two trilinear rpv couplings , containing either a  quark  squark or lepton ",
    "slepton pair .",
    "the second takes into account possible neutrino  neutralino mixing , which occurs on the external neutrino lines in the form of bilinear mass insertions .",
    "the third one , discussed in this paper , allows for the mass insertions to appear inside the loop , which may contain a  number of different particles , i.e. , charged higgs bosons and the corresponding higgsinos , leptons and sleptons , charged gauge bosons , and charginos .",
    "a  proper discussion of the latter contribution is possible only within a  consistent @xmath0-parity violating model , in which all the mixing between different mass eigenstates is taken into account .",
    "also , new terms in the rge equations , proportional to the rpv couplings appear . however , the impact of these terms has already been studied @xcite and their presence changed the low energy mass spectrum of the model by a  factor of 1/5 at most ( 20% ) .",
    "this indicates , that the crucial point is the phenomenon of mixing between different mass eigenstates , so that the amplitudes of the processes must be expanded in the physical bases and summed over respective eigenstates .",
    "we have found that the presently discussed contributions are dominant over the remaining two .",
    "this allowed us to find the acceptable parameter space of the model , using the condition that no magnetic moment may exceed @xmath140 .",
    "we have also checked , how different initial values of the rpv couplings , represented by @xmath46 , change the results . finally , a  comparison with previous numerical studies has been given .",
    "this work has been financed by the polish national science centre under the decision number dec-2011/01/b / st2/05932 .",
