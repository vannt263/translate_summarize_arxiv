    "in flat space - time , lorentz invariance is a guide which generally allows to identify a unique vacuum state for the theory .",
    "however , in curved space - time , we do not have lorentz symmetry . in general , there does not exist a unique vacuum state in a curved spacetime . as a result ,",
    "the concept of particles becomes ambiguous , and the problem of the physical interpretation becomes much more difficult @xcite .",
    "the creation of particles from the vacuum takes place due to the interaction with dynamical external constraints .",
    "for example the motion of a single reflecting boundary ( mirror ) can create particles @xcite , the creation of particles by time - dependent external gravitational field is another example of dynamical external constraints .",
    "nowadays it is strongly believed that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "recent observations from type ia supernovae @xcite in associated with large scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite have provided main evidence for this cosmic acceleration .",
    "it seems that some unknown energy components ( dark energy ) with negative pressure are responsible for this late - time acceleration @xcite .",

    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 gravity has been performed according to the holographic dark energy @xcite .",
    "models based on modified teleparallel gravity were presented , in one hand , as an alternative to inflationary models @xcite , and on the other hand , as an alternative to dark energy models @xcite .    in this paper",

    "@xmath7 , particle production phenomenon in an expanding universe is extensively discussed . finally , in sec . 4 , we present the conclusion .",
    "let us consider the action for the theory of modified gravity based on a modification of the teleparallel equivalent of gr , namely @xmath0 theory of gravity , coupled with matter @xmath8 , given by @xcite-@xcite @xmath9_,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , and @xmath3 denotes an arbitrary function of @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the function @xmath0 is assumed to be a sum of the teleparallel gravity term @xmath1 and an arbitrary function @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 .",

    "now , we take the usual spatially - flat metric of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , in agreement with observations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scale factor as function of the cosmic time @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , we assume the background to be a perfect fluid . using the friedmann - robertson - walker metric and the perfect fluid matter in the teleparallel lagrangian ( [ 2 ] ) and the field equations ( [ 3 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the matter density and pressure respectively , and the hubble parameter @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .    in the frw universe",
    ", the energy conservation law can be expressed as the standard continuity equation @xmath31 where we used the barotropic equation of state @xmath32 relating the ordinary pressure with the ordinary energy density .",

    "one gets the power - law solution for the scale factor in terms of @xmath33 as @xmath38 where the parameter @xmath39 depends on the algebraic function @xmath3 and its first and second derivatives , as well as the ordinary components @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that if @xmath40 the universe evolves so that @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) corresponding to a decelerating universe .",

    ", the effective energy density can be written as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a positive constant . also , using ( [ 9 ] ) , eq.([4 ] ) leads to the following result @xmath53 we see from ( [ torsionexpress ] ) that if @xmath40 , at early time @xmath54 , the exponent of @xmath55 in ( [ torsionexpress ] ) is negative and the torsion scalar diverges , @xmath56 , while for late - time @xmath57 , the torsion scalar goes to zero ( @xmath58 ) . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the exponent of @xmath55 is positive and at the early time @xmath60 , the torsion scalar also diverges ( @xmath56 ) , while at late - time @xmath49 , the torsion scalar goes to zero . in the case where @xmath46 , the exponent of @xmath55 is negative so that at early time @xmath60 , the torsion scalar goes to zero ( @xmath58 ) , while at late - time @xmath49 , the torsion scalar diverges @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that for an expanded decelerated universe the torsion scalar is initially strong and the conformal time evolves it goes to zero . for an expanded",
    "accelerating universe in quintessence phase , the torsion scalar is still initially strong and as the conformal time evolves , it goes to zero .",
    "however , the opposite occurs in an expanded accelerating universe in phantom phase , i.e. , the torsion scalar is initially null and as the conformal time increases it diverges as the late - time is approached .",
    "let us denote by @xmath61 a scalar field of mass @xmath62 and @xmath63 the scale factor depending on the conformal time @xmath33 for spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic frw spacetime .",
    "the line element in terms of the conformal time is written as follows @xmath64 the lagrangian that describes the minimal coupling between the massive scalar field with the gravitational in conformal spacetime is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the metric in minkowski space .",

    "can be used for constructing the field and each of them possesses its own vacuum state .",
    "if we label one of these set of modes by @xmath86 , then , the field can be written in terms of these modes as @xmath87\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding vacuum state is such that @xmath88 for all @xmath89 .",

    "taken in consideration the completeness , the two sets of modes @xmath94 and @xmath95 are related by the bogoliubov transformations that diagonalize the hamiltonian i.e. , @xmath96 , satisfying the relation @xmath97 with the normalization condition @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are called bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "we can now compare the two vacuum states by noting that the number operator for the barred states is @xmath101 .",
    "computing its expectation value with respect to the unbarred vacuum , we get @xmath102 hence , the number of barred particles in the unbarred vacuum in the mode @xmath89 is @xmath103 . in the same way ,",
    "the number of unbarred particles in the barred vacuum in the mode @xmath89 is @xmath103 .",
    "since the diagonalization imposes @xmath96 , using ( [ vin12 ] ) with @xmath71 substituted by @xmath93 , one gets @xmath104 putting this result in the expression of @xmath105 , we obtain @xmath106 by using ( [ vin11 ] ) and ( [ vin15 ] ) , one obtains @xmath107 and therefore @xmath108 ) and ( [ vin19 ] ) , ( [ vin21 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath109 ) .",
    "now , in order to calculate @xmath110 we have to find @xmath111 from ( [ vin5 ] ) and @xmath112 from ( [ vin18 ] ) . making use of ( [ 9 ] ) in ( [ vin5 ] )",

    "now we can proceed to the calculation of @xmath110 through the expression ( [ vin22 ] ) .",

    "however , this is not the case when @xmath40 , since using the asymptotic initial limit of the hankel functions , one gets @xmath126 .",
    "it appears clearly through ( [ vin56 ] ) that in an expanded accelerating universe , @xmath43 , particle production is initially null , and as time evolves it becomes important at late - time .",
    "but in an expanded decelerating universe , particle production is initially strong and becomes inefficient at late - time .",
    "this seems quick reasonable because the expanded decelerating universe is the matter dominated universe and comes before the accelerating dark energy dominated one .",
    "the end of the matter dominated phase is linked with the early of the accelerating one , and one sees clearly that the matching of the two phases on the point of view of particle production is realized , because at the end of the decelerating phase @xmath127(@xmath40 ) , and at the beginning of the accelerating phase @xmath128 ( @xmath43 ) , the rate of particle production vanishes .",
    "as the conformal time grows , the evolution of the total number @xmath129 of created particle per unit of space volume is @xcite @xmath130 and the quantum energy density associated to massless particle production is @xmath131    thus , according to the values of the effective parameter of the equation of state @xmath132 , the phenomenon of particle production can change from the early time to the late one .",
    "we can distinguish three different cases :    @xmath133 for @xmath40 , the conformal time is such that @xmath134 and the torsion scalar @xmath135 , where the rate of particle production @xmath110 is initially important and decreases as the time evolves .",
    "in this situation we see that in an expanded decelerating universe , the order of magnitude of the rate of particle production is directly linked with the torsion scalar , i.e. , for large torsion scalar , the rate of particle production is important and for small torsion scalar , the rate of particle production becomes small .",
    "@xmath133 for @xmath59 , one has @xmath44 and @xmath135 , whereas the rate of particle production is initially null , and increases as the time grows .",
    "note that this is a quintessence - like situation and one can conclude in this case that the magnitude of the rate of particle production is inversely linked with the order of magnitude of the torsion scalar , i.e. , for large torsion scalar the rate of particle production vanishes , while for small torsion scalar the rate of particle production diverges .",
    "thus , we can conclude that in quintessence - like universe , the rate of particle production and the torsion scalar do not follow the same order of magnitude .",
    "@xmath133 for @xmath46 , we have for the conformal time @xmath44 , whereas for the torsion scalar , @xmath136 . here",
    ", the rate of particle production is initially null and as the time grows , it increases . we see that for small magnitude of torsion scalar , the rate of particle production is also small , while for large magnitude of torsion scalar , the rate of particle production is also large .",
    "we conclude that in the phantom - like universe , the rate of particle production is directly linked with the order of magnitude of the torsion scalar .    in this later case , one can observe that as the final time is approached , @xmath49 , the scale factor @xmath63 , the effective energy density @xmath137 and effective pressure @xmath138 diverge ; this is the so - called big rip ( singularity of type - i ) .",
    "do to this finite time singularity , we focus our attention to this case and try to analyse the effects of particle production around the singularity .",
    "we present in fig.1 the evolution of the quantum energy density ( energy density of particle production ) , as well as it quotient over the classical one ( the effective energy density ) @xmath139 .",
    "we also present the graph of the evolution of the torsion scalar in this phantom case .",
    "the important and interesting feature to be notified here is the evolution of @xmath139 when the time evolves .",
    "we see that as the conformal singularity time is approached , both the classical and quantum energy densities diverge , but particularly , the quotient @xmath139 goes to zero .",
    "this means that as the singularity is approached , quantum effect due to particle production is inefficient with respect to the classical effective energy density of the background",
    ". therefore , mass - less particle production can not avoid the big rip .",
    "this situation is the same as that in which the gravitational part of the action is driven by the curvature and gravitational field is minimally coupled with the scalar field . in gr",
    "the curvature scalar reads @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to see that this latter is proportional to the torsion scalar .",
    "therefore , for any value of @xmath141 , the evolution of the curvature scalar will be same as that of the torsion scalar , and this , for an expanded decelerating phase @xmath142 , an expanded accelerated quintessence phase @xmath143 , and the expanded accelerating phantom phase @xmath144 .",
    "particularly , in phantom phase when the curvature goes to zero or almost null , there is no particle production , while as the curvature increases , the particle production becomes important @xcite .    other important point to be put out here is that _ particle production aspect _ for massless scalar field appears to be the same for gr , @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath0 . in @xmath0 theory , one can show how the algebraic function @xmath0 can influence the particle production .",
    "remark that the scale factor depends on the effective parameter of equation of state @xmath39 , because of the dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath37 on the torsion scalar .",
    "then , the sign of @xmath132 will depend on the expression of the algebraic function @xmath0 .    as in gr and @xmath2 gravity ,",
    "one can write the lagrangian density @xmath8 in teleparallel ( see also @xcite where this type of lagrangian density is used and the stability of non - minimally conformally coupled scalar field has been widely developed with interesting results ) , as @xmath145 through the euler - lagrangian equation , and using the fourier space , one gets the klein - gordon equation for each quantum mode @xmath146 , as @xmath147 by setting @xmath148 , one gets the following equation @xmath149 observe that for the minimally coupling , i.e. , @xmath150 , the contribution of the torsion in this equation disappears .",
    "thus , we see clearly that for minimally coupling constant , the aspect of particle production is the same in @xmath0 theory as in @xmath2 theory .",
    "it is important to note that particle production aspect is different from the quantitative aspect of particle production .",
    "what we would like to show here is the form of klein - gordon equation for both @xmath2 and @xmath0 theories . for minimally coupling constant , and in our case where the massless field is considered , the previous equation becomes @xmath151 for both @xmath2 and @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
    "even , the massive field is considered within minimally coupling choice , the two theories present the same result , @xmath152 as it is well known in quantum field theory @xcite , particle production depends on the effective mass , which is @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively for massless scalar field and massive scalar field minimally coupled with the gravitational one .",
    "particularly , for the purpose of this work where massless scalar field is considered , one sees that in phantom phase , @xmath46 , the effective mass @xmath155 . in this phantom phase ,",
    "the early corresponds to @xmath60 , for which the effective mass vanishes , leading to klein - gordon equation for massless field minimally coupled with the gravitational in minkowski s spacetime , where particle production never occurs : this is the vacuum .",
    "but as the time evolves , the effective mass @xmath156 increases , and diverges as at the late - time @xmath49 .",
    "this result is valid for both @xmath2(including gr ) and @xmath0 theory .",
    "consequently , quantum effects due to massless particle production from minimally coupled field have to be the same in @xmath0 as in the framework of gr and @xmath2 gravity , where it shown that quantum effects can not avoid the occurrence of the big rip @xcite",
    ". the same would appear in the case of the sudden singularity where quantum effect is inefficient , showing that this singularity is also robust with respect to quantum effects @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that when the scalar field is not minimally coupled with the gravitational one , the particle production seems different , at least quantitatively .",
    "note that , in both the coupling and non - coupling case , the torsion scalar remains the same , initially null and growing as the time evolves .",
    "the capital difference that appears between the gr and the teleparallel when the fields are not minimally coupled is about the time dependent expression of the torsion scalar @xmath1 in teleparallel gravity and the ricici scalar @xmath5 in gr .",
    "note that in gr and @xmath2 gravity , the equation ( [ debat ] ) is written as @xmath157 in gr and @xmath2 , the expression of the ricci scalar based on the conformal time is @xmath158 , while in teleparallel gravity and @xmath0 theory of gravity , the expression of the torsion scalar is @xmath159 .",
    "then , ( [ debat ] ) and ( [ debat1 ] ) become respectively @xmath160\\chi_k=0\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\quad \\xi(\\eta)=-\\frac{a^{\\prime\\,2}}{aa^{\\prime\\prime}}\\xi_c\\label{debat3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath161\\chi_k=0\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\label{debat4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 denotes here the coupling constant commonly know in gr and @xmath163 is the coupling constant in teleparallel gravity .. it appears clearly that if @xmath164 ( the minimally coupling case ) , @xmath165 , and the equations ( [ debat3 ] ) and ( [ debat4 ] ) are equivalent .",
    "however , if the non - minimally coupling is considered , the two equations are not equivalent and consequently their solutions should not be the same . since the solution of the equation of motion is the most necessary element for calculating the bogoliubov coefficients , the results must be different .",
    "now , looking for the equations ( [ debat3 ] ) and ( [ debat4 ] ) , it can be concluded that in @xmath0 gravity , the coupling parameter between the scalar and gravitational fields is a _ running coupling constant_. then , in general , in the view of particle production , the equivalence between the teleparallel and the gr no longer occurs when the scalar field is non - minimally coupled with the gravitational one .",
    "in this paper we have studied particle creation in frw universe in the framework of @xmath0 gravity , considering massless scalar field minimally coupled with the gravitational one .",
    "since the case when the spatial sections are flat is slightly simpler , we have restricted our attention to this later in this work . by solving the generalized equations of friedmann ,",
    "one gets a power - law solution for the scale factor , which depends on an effective parameter of equation of state @xmath132 . in general",
    ", we see that in an expanded decelerating universe , @xmath40 , the conformal time @xmath33 goes from @xmath166 to @xmath48 , while the torsion scalar @xmath1 goes from @xmath167 to zero . in this case",
    ", the rate of particle production @xmath110 in initially strong and as the conformal time evolves it decreases and tends to zero as the late - time is approached . for @xmath59 , the quintessence - like phase , the conformal time goes from @xmath167 to zero , and similarly , the torsion scalar goes from @xmath167 to zero .",
    "but in this case , the rate of particle production is initially null and as the time evolves it increases and diverges as the late - time is approached .",
    "the final and interesting case is the phantom - like case where @xmath46 . here",
    ", the conformal time goes from @xmath167 to zero whereas the torsion scalar is initially null and decreases to @xmath167 as the time evolves . in this case ,",
    "particle production is initially null , increases as the conformal time evolves and diverges at the late - time .",
    "we conclude that the rate of particle production is directly connected to the order of magnitude of the torsion scalar in the expanded decelerating and expanded accelerating phantom universes .",
    "however , in quintessence - like universe , the situation is different : as the torsion scalar is large , the rate of particle production is inefficient and for small torsion scalar , the rate of particle production becomes important .    since in the phantom - like case ,",
    "the big rip ( the singularity of type - i ) may appear , we analyse the effects of particle production around the singularity .",
    "the result shows that the energy density due to particle production diverges as the singularity time is approached , but is not enough to avoid the occurrence of the singularity .",
    "moreover , we present the comparison of particle production aspect between @xmath2 and @xmath0 in general .",
    "since the interpretation of quantum particle production is based on the effective mass @xmath168 , we shown that particle production aspect is the same for both gr and tele - parallel theory , and this may be extended to both @xmath2 and @xmath0 theories , for massless scalar field minimally coupled with the gravitational one . however ,",
    "when the scalar field is non - minimally coupled with the gravitational one , this equivalence breaks down for the gr and tele - parallel theory , and consequently for @xmath2 and @xmath0 . comparing with the gr ( respectively @xmath2 theory ) where the coupling constant is effectively constant , the tele - parallel theory ( respectively @xmath0 theory ) presents a running coupling constant .",
