    "this time - symmetric approach to quantum mechanics has been emphasized in ref .",

    "we derive the two consistency conditions for the weak value vectors which enables us to interpret them as ( complex ) conditional probabilities for counter - factual processes in quantum mechanics .",
    "we shall explicitly give in what cases a weak value becomes strange .",

    "the description of intermediate state @xmath24 in the present work is counter - factual or virtual in the sense that the intermediate state would not be observed by projective measurements .",

    ", we confirm this by the identity , @xmath43 steinberg  @xcite addressed the issue of the tunneling traversal time from the view point of the weak measurement in which he proposed the joint and conditional probabilities for the counter - factual cases in quantum mechanics .",
    "we regard the relation ( [ joint ] ) of the joint and conditional probabilities as consistency conditions for a set of weak values in a framework where the weak value is promoted to a fundamental concept independent of the weak measurement model .",

    "a keen reader may notice that only the real part of the weak value is relevant in the bayesian - like rule ( [ bay ] ) so that there is an option that we interpret only the real part as a conditional probability",
    ". then it would be interesting to consider the restricted cases where the weak values are real .",
    "this also demands the reality of the joint probability ( [ joint ] ) , which implies the commutativity of the observables @xmath1 and @xmath39 relative to the pre - selected state @xmath15 , i.e. , there is no heisenberg - robertson uncertainty @xmath52 for the state @xmath15 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the square root of the variances of @xmath1 and @xmath39 .",

    "one might interpret the @xmath61 as a  negative \" conditional probability for the path @xmath62 .",
    "we can see the negative conditional probability is also responsible for the various  strange \" weak values , e.g. , the weak value of the @xmath63component of the spin of a dirac particle can be very large , say @xmath64  @xcite  .",

    "these factual results can be also reproduced by the abl formula  @xcite , i.e. , the absolute value squared of the weak values multiplied by the weight of the post - selected state . in the case of @xmath110 for the positron , the abl formula gives @xmath179 and @xmath180 for @xmath178 and @xmath176 , respectively . in the case of @xmath107",

    "we consider a different choice of post - selected state @xmath73 keeping the same pre - selected state @xmath183 ( [ originalhardy ] ) . for the intermediate @xmath184 ,",

    "the last row indicates that the consistency condition 1 ( [ consistency1 ] ) is satisfied , since the sum of the weak values over the complete set of orthonormal projectors is unity for all the post - selected states . to confirm the consistency 2 ( [ consistency2 ] )",
    "we see in the rightmost column that the weighted average of the weak values over the post - selected states for each intermediate state becomes the probability for the intermediate state to be actually observed by projective measurements .",
    "let us look at the column of @xmath119 .",
    "the apparent puzzle is that the  probabilities \" for @xmath165 or @xmath193 add up to @xmath163 exceeding @xmath169 .",
    "the weak value resolution to it is that the  probability \" of the remaining @xmath194 is @xmath167 so that the total  probability \" is @xmath195 !    with this example",
    "we can see more clearly how the minus sign emerges in the table of the weak values .",

    "assume that all the components of them are positive",
    ". otherwise , we have done .",
    "keep one of them as it is and find an orthogonal vector to it by the schmidt orthogonalization of the other one .",
    "one may be easily convinced that the new one contains at least one negative component , unless the new one is lying along one of the axis .",
    "if the latter is the case we can go on picking up the third one and then schmidt diagonalization . if we end up with the configuration of the weak values which are all along the different axes , this is against our assumption of counter - factuality .",
    "that is , we could verify the weak value by a projective measurement . in hardy s paradox ,",
    "the counter - factuality is unavoidable so that the negative weak value should appear for a set of orthogonal set of projection operators and post - selected states .",
    "here we would like to re - emphasize the remark around eq .",
    "( [ abl_formula ] ) that the concept of weak value gives a physical basis of counter - factual arguments in hardy s setting .",
    "the apparent paradox comes from the omission of the non - local possibility @xmath161 and the non - orthogonality of @xmath111 and @xmath116 .",
    "hopefully the weak value is helpful to resolve quantum paradoxes which come from counter - factual arguments in more general settings .",
    "so far we have mainly studied the projection operators as observables , which are relevant in most of the optical experiments . in this section",
    "we study the non - commuting variables in the simple spin @xmath0 case .",
    "in contrast to the preceding case , we will encounter complex weak values and a new consistency condition .",
    "we choose the pauli operators @xmath196 and @xmath197 as the three non - commuting observables .",
    "let us start with an illustrative example : the pre - selected state is given by @xmath198 and the post - selected states are @xmath199 .",
    "the table for the weak values is @xmath200    table ( [ table4 ] ) exhibits the fact that the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 are orthogonal with respect to the pre - selected state @xmath201 , since @xmath202 . from the discussion of sect .",
    "[ sec_formal ] , we see that the weak vectors of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are real and orthogonal to each other , while that of @xmath197 is complex",
    ".    we can also compose the non - orthogonal positive weak value vectors , e.g. , as @xmath203 we can clearly see that if the non - orthogonal vectors of weak values are positive vectors , then the orthogonal operators with respect to the preselected states contain at least one negative weak value .",
    "we would like to see how strange weak values , which are outside the range of eigenvalues , show up in the spin @xmath0 case for the more general pre - selected state @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are assumed to be real to simplify the exposition .",
    "the post - selected states are @xmath207 and @xmath71 .",
    "we compute the weak values , @xmath208 where @xmath209 .",
    "of course , they are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "the weighted average gives the bloch vector of the pre - selected state @xmath15 as shown in table ( [ table6 ] ) .",
    "the consistency with the multiplication rules , @xmath210 etc . can be checked , as well as the  sum of squared \" results .",
    "let us see the weak value for a pair of orthogonal projection operators , @xmath211 : @xmath212    it is evident that at least one of the weak values is negative . for @xmath213",
    "the weak value of @xmath214 with the post - selection @xmath215 is negative .",
    "this also means the weak value of @xmath216 for the post - selection @xmath215 is strange , i.e. , more than unity and thus outside the range of the eigenvalue spectrum discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_neg ] .",
    "the appearance of strange values can also be seen without explicitly calculating the weak values .",
    "note that @xmath217 in general for an arbitrary post - selected state @xmath218 .",
    "this implies that @xmath219 . by a suitable rotation",
    ", we will have @xmath220 .",
    "we can see either @xmath221 or @xmath222 is strange , i.e. , larger than @xmath169 .",
    "the abl formula cam be confirmed using @xmath223 .",
    "the intermediate states are orthogonal and therefore distinguishable so that they can be identified by a projective measurement , i.e. , factual .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a framework of weak value vectors and derived the two consistency conditions for them which enables us to interpret them as ( complex ) conditional probabilities for counter - factual processes in quantum paradoxes .",
    "we have shown that at least one of the components of the weak value vector becomes strange for counter - factual process .",
    "two examples hardy s paradox and the spin @xmath0 system were demonstrated . in the former ,",
    "the choice of the pre - selected state is unique from the setting of the paradox and the appearance of the  negative probability \" is due to the counter - factuality . in the latter we have discussed the case of non - commutative operators to weakly observe .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the weak value should be studied on its own right and believe that this is just the right quantity to describe a sequence of counter - factual phenomena in quantum mechanics by virtue of the  probabilistic \" interpretation explained in this paper .",
