    "three geometric closely related properties , with fairly intuitive interpretations , are analyzed in this paper .",

    "@xcite ) , _ @xmath0-convexity , ( perkal @xcite , mani - levitska @xcite , walther @xcite ) and _ rolling condition ( walther @xcite ) .",
    "our interest in these `` rolling - type properties '' is motivated in the framework of set estimation , that is , the problem of reconstructing a set @xmath5 ( typically a density support or a density level set ) from a random sample of points ; see e.g. cuevas and fraiman @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "the classical theory of this subject , dating back to the 1960 s , is largely concerned with the assumption that @xmath6 is convex ; see e.g. dmbgen and walther @xcite or reitzner @xcite for a survey .",
    "the rolling - type properties have been employed as shape restrictions on @xmath6 alternative to ( and much broader than ) the convexity assumption . _ _ _    the rolling - type conditions are useful in statistics and stochastic geometry at least in two ways .",
    "first , they can be sometimes incorporated to the estimator : for example , if the ( compact ) support @xmath6 of a random variable @xmath7 is assumed to be @xmath0-convex one could estimate @xmath6 , from a random sample of @xmath7 by taking the @xmath0-convex hull of the sample points , much in the same way as the convex hull has been used to estimate a convex support ; see rodrguez - casal @xcite .",
    "second , they can be used as regularity assumptions in order to get faster rates of convergence for the estimators ; see , e.g. , cuevas and rodrguez - casal @xcite , pateiro - lpez and rodrguez - casal @xcite . of course other , perhaps more standard",
    ", regularity conditions have also been used in set estimation .",
    "they rely on usual smoothness assumptions on the boundary or the underlying density , defined in terms of derivatives .",
    "see biau et al .",
    "@xcite and mason and polonik @xcite for some recent interesting examples .",
    "some deep results on the connection between differentiability assumptions and rolling - type conditions can be found in federer @xcite , walther @xcite and ambrosio et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most popular among the rolling - type properties is by far the positive reach condition .",
    "it was introduced by federer @xcite in a celebrated paper which could be considered as a landmark in geometric measure theory . among other relevant results ,",
    "federer @xcite proved that ( theorem 5.6 ) , for a compact set @xmath6 with reach @xmath8 , the volume ( lebesgue measure ) of the @xmath9-parallel set @xmath10 can be expressed as a polynomial in @xmath9 , of degree @xmath11 , for @xmath12 .",
    "this is a partial generalization of the classical steiner formula that shows this property for convex sets for all @xmath13 .",
    "so the positive reach property can be seen as a natural generalization of convexity in a much deeper sense than that suggested by the definition .",
    "for some recent interesting contributions on this property see ambrosio et al .",

    "an application in set estimation , more specifically in the problem of estimating the boundary measure , can be found in cuevas et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-convexity property provides a different but closely related generalization of convexity ( see section [ rolling ] for precise definitions ) . whereas this property has also a sound intuitive motivation it is much less popular .",
    "an earlier reference is perkal @xcite but , to our knowledge , the first statistical application is due to walther @xcite who uses this condition in the setting of level set estimation .",
    "a study of the @xmath0-convex hull as an estimator of an @xmath0-convex support can be found in rodrguez - casal @xcite .",
    "let us know establish some notation and basic definitions .",
    "we are concerned here with subsets of @xmath14 although some concepts and results can be stated , with little additional effort , in the broader setup of metric spaces .",
    "the euclidean norm in @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "given a set @xmath16 , we denote by @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the complement , interior and boundary of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the closed ball with centre @xmath22 and radius @xmath0 . by convenience",
    ", the open ball @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath24 .    in the problem of estimating a compact set and/or its boundary we need to use some suitable distances in order to assess the quality of the estimation and",
    "establish asymptotic results ( concerning consistency , convergence rates and asymptotic distribution ) .",
    "the most usual distances in this setting are the _",
    "hausdorff distance @xmath25 and the _ distance in measure @xmath26 .",

    "often @xmath35 is either a probability measure or the lebesgue measure on @xmath41 , which we will denote by @xmath42 .",
    "note that the distance function @xmath26 is actually a pseudometric but it becomes a true metric if we identify two sets differing in a @xmath35-null set .",
    "this amounts to work in the quotient space associated with the corresponding equivalence relation .    besides the estimation of the set @xmath6 and the boundary @xmath43 , some functionals of @xmath6 are sometimes of interest as estimation targets",
    "this is the case of the @xmath44-dimensional boundary measure , @xmath45 ( that is the perimeter of @xmath6 for @xmath46 and the surface area for @xmath47 ) .",
    "there are several , not always equivalent , definitions for @xmath45 ( see mattila @xcite ) but we will mainly use the _ outer minkowski content , @xmath48 under regularity conditions , the limit in ( [ os ] ) coincides with the usual _ minkowski content given by @xmath49 we refer to ambrosio et al .",

    "_ _    the contributions in this paper can be now summarized as follows . in section [ rolling ]",
    "we clarify the relations between the rolling - type conditions pointing out that if the reach of a set is @xmath0 , then it is @xmath0-convex and , in turn , @xmath0-convexity entails the @xmath0-rolling property .",
    "see propositions [ reachrconvex ] and [ rconvexroll ] .",
    "it is also shown that the converse implications are not true in general . in section [ sub : seq ]",
    "we prove that , under very general conditions on @xmath35 and @xmath6 , @xmath50 plus @xmath51 ( we call this simultaneous convergence _ full convergence ) implies @xmath52 ( theorem [ dhdmu ] ) .",
    "we also show ( theorem [ partialsn ] ) that if the sets @xmath53 fulfill the rolling condition , the @xmath25-convergence @xmath50 implies full convergence .",
    "this result ( which has some independent interest ) is used below in the paper . in section [ sec : bill ] we show that , under broad conditions , the class of uniformly bounded sets with reach @xmath54 is a @xmath1-uniformity class ( in the sense of billingsley and topse @xcite ) and therefore also a glivenko - cantelli class .",

    "this is an interesting contribution to the theory of nonparametric boundary estimation which so far relies mostly on the use of two samples ( one inside and the other outside the set @xmath6 ) ; see cuevas et al .",

    "convexity is a natural geometrical restriction that arises in many fields . while the study of this topic dates back to antiquity , most important contributions and applications date from the 19th and 20th centuries .",
    "we refer to the handbook edited by gruber and wills @xcite for a complete survey of convex geometry and its relations to other areas of mathematics",
    ". however , convexity leaves out usual features of sets such as holes or notches and may be considered an unrealistic assumption in some situations . as a natural consequence ,",
    "there are meaningful extensions of the notion of convexity ; see e.g. mani - levitska @xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall consider three different shape restrictions that generalize that of convexity .",
    "we group them under the name of rolling - type conditions .",
    "their formal definitions are as follows .    given @xmath8 , a set @xmath58 is said to fulfill the ( outside ) @xmath0-rolling condition if for all @xmath59 there is a closed ball with radius @xmath0 , @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the radius @xmath0 of the ball acts a smoothing parameter .",
    "we refer to walther @xcite for a deep study of this condition .",

    "besides all convex closed sets ( which have infinite reach ) and regular submanifolds of class 2 of @xmath41 , the class of sets of positive reach also contains nonconvex sets or sets whose boundary is not a smooth manifold .",
    "sets with positive reach were introduced by federer @xcite who also obtained their main properties . in particular , these sets obey a steiner formula in the following sense .",
