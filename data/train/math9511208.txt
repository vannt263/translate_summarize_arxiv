    ", it would be helpful to answer the question : for which @xmath5 in @xmath4 is the julia set @xmath2 locally connected ?",

    ", we discuss sullivan s sector theorem .",

    "the proof repeatedly applies the sharpest version of koebe s distortion theorem ( see  [ bie ] ) , and uses sullivan s idea about using hyperbolic contraction to trap points in a hyperbolic neighborhood .    using the generalized version of sullivan s sector theorem",
