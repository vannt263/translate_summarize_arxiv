    "the threshold behavior of the total cross section for the reaction @xmath2 can be described by : @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xmath5 is the nucleon mass , @xmath6 is the mass of @xmath7 .",
    "this estimation is based on @xmath8exchange mechanism , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and on the comparison with the processes @xmath9 ( @xmath10exchange ) , assuming @xmath11 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the threshold @xmath12-behavior ( @xmath13 is the energy excess over threshold ) , is the phase - space for a three - body reaction @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we report the threshold behavior of the cross section for the reaction @xmath2 as a function of @xmath13 , ( top ) and of the proton kinetic energy ( bottom ) .",
    "no experimental data exist in the threshold region .",
    "the lowest energy where the open charm cross section has been measured , @xmath14=70 gev , @xmath15 gev , corresponds to @xmath16 gev . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq15 ] ) we find , for this energy : @xmath17 @xmath18b , to be compared to the experimental value @xmath19 @xmath18b @xcite .",
    "the calculation rigorously hold only for @xmath20 .",
    "the near threshold can be approximated as : @xmath21 and it flattens at larger energies .",
    "the has been calculated in @xcite , in analogy with strange particle production , and it has been found @xmath22 depending on the choice of the cut off parameter for the form factor , which has to be introduced in the vertex of the diagram .",
    "let us note that this number is larger than the direct experimental value @xcite . using these cross section",
    ", one can find : @xmath23    following @xcite , in analogy with strange particle production in @xmath24-collisions , in principle one should take into account another contribution , @xmath25-exchange , which may increase the cross section of a factor four . therefore : @xmath26 which is in agreement with the experimental value of 40@xmath27 200 @xmath18b at @xmath28=62 gev @xcite .",
    "the models @xcite allow to calculate the cross section for all channels of exclusive charm particle production , not only for @xmath29- but also for @xmath30-collisions .",
    "the starting point of such calculations is the isotopic structure of the matrix element @xmath31 for @xmath32 , which is model independent .",
    "we give here the necessary relations based on the isotopic invariance of the strong interaction , with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the isotopic amplitudes , corresponding to the total isospin @xmath38 for the initial nucleons and the total isospin @xmath39 for the produced @xmath40-system .",
    "in fact we have twice more of these reactions , by changing isospin @xmath41 ( for example @xmath42 ) .",
    "one can see , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) , that seven different matrix elements for different @xmath43-reactions , are characterized by three complex isotopic amplitudes : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . relations ( [ eq : amp ] ) hold for any model in any kinematical condition .    model independent relations among the seven differential cross sections hold : @xmath47    the isotopic averaged cross section for the processes @xmath48 , typically used in the transport codes , is defined as : @xmath49 therefore : @xmath50 and does not contain any interference term between the different isotopic amplitudes .",
    "the isotopic amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the cross sections as : @xmath51    the situation essentially changes near the reaction threshold , where all final particles are produced in @xmath52-state . the selection rules with respect to the pauli principle",
    ", the p - invariance and the conservation of isospin and of the total angular momentum , allow to find a more simple spin structure for the matrix element for @xmath29 and @xmath30-collisions in @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of the threshold spin structure is that the interferences @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which can be present in the general case , vanish in the threshold region , after summing over the polarizations of the colliding nucleons . therefore at threshold we can derive the following relations , additional to ( [ eq : sig ] ) , which hold for any model : @xmath55 @xmath56      taking the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "d - exchange model : the amplitudes are proportional to the amplitude for elastic dn - scattering , which is a combination of amplitudes for the two possible states of isotopic spin , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "su(4 ) symmetry : @xmath59 ( as for kn scattering ) , so we neglect the amplitudes corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "threshold regime : all particles are in s final state ; no interference between singlet and triplet initial states .",
    "we find : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "this derives from the fact that @xmath44 and @xmath46 are both proportional to @xmath57 , therefore the spin structure of theses amplitudes may be different , but their moduli squared are the same .",
    "@xmath65 can be calculated from the proportionality with @xmath66 : @xmath67 .",
    "if one assume @xmath11-symmetry , in the considered @xmath68-exchange model , the ratio of the coupling constants @xmath69 can be related to @xmath70 .",
    "an estimation of this ratio from the literature ( @xcite and refs herein ) gives @xmath71 .    the overall @xmath72-production , due to the discussed reactions , results in about @xmath73 .",
    "the calculation @xcite takes into account the general threshold symmetry properties of the strong interaction , such as the the conservation of parity , total angular momentum , and the pauli principle .",
    "current models , which reproduce high energy data , can not always be safely extrapolated to threshold .",
    "for example , in @xcite the cross section is taken as : @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath72 production , and slightly different paramaters for @xmath80-production : @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] a comparison between the calculations @xcite ( thick lines ) and @xcite ( thin lines ) is shown for @xmath72 production ( solid lines ) and for @xmath80-production ( dashed lines ) .",
    "one can see that the values can differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "this comes from the fact that the correct @xmath13-behavior at threshold , from phase space considerations , should be quadratic , whereas the best fit parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite give an exponent @xmath85 .",
    "the difference is also due to the fact that the isotopic relations among @xmath72 and @xmath80-cross sections are not respected in the parametrization @xcite .",
    "this induces very large effect in particular in the threshold region .",
    "note that the calculation @xcite , which is based on the quark - gluon string model and the regge phenomenology , is in agreement with @xcite , for a specific choice of form factors .",
