    "the answer is almost certainly affirmative.''@xcite    in examining the distribution of zeros of our example case @xmath62 , we are interested in their density and infinitude , and ask : for every @xmath3 is there an infinite number of @xmath13 s for which @xmath141 ? in figure [ fig : bwfract_002 ] , the zeros of @xmath62 are highlighted with red bands ; numerous zeros can be seen in the @xmath35 gridplot with density rapidly diminishing for each sequence of increasing @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig : countzerosexpfit ] is a plot of the density of zeros of @xmath145 vs. @xmath20 for @xmath106 .",

    "exponential fits to the data and samples @xmath73 are shown in the legend .",

    "although our sample only yields four data points for @xmath149 and three data points for @xmath150 , the strong exponential fits give no reason to expect that the number of zeros is finite for any order of @xmath20 or @xmath1 .",
    "vs. @xmath20 for @xmath146 , @xmath73 samples , and exponential fits ]      up to this point , we have mostly focused on a local case of @xmath70 with parameters fixed at @xmath59 , @xmath31 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the prime - index order @xmath20 has been the chief parameter examined , as it is the fractal scaling parameter of @xmath62 , while @xmath13 is the index of the function .",
    "returning to the topic of local structure discussed in section [ section : introduction ] , consider that for our example case @xmath62 and any @xmath151 , the primes @xmath152 encode ` special ' information ( i.e. , the distribution of @xmath153 ) , while all other primes @xmath154 apparently do not .",
