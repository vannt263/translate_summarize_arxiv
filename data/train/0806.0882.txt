    "in contrast , in between the two vertical lines and after the system reaches the stationary oscs , particles rotating in either direction , clockwise or counterclockwise , will remain rotating in such a way regardless of the fluctuations induced by the noise .",

    "for this case , @xmath69 smoothes out completely and , as region iii disappears , the transition from the trans in region ii to the oscs in region iv shows an apparent continuous nature with critical point @xmath89 ( see fig .",

    "thus , the critical points that separate the different stability regions will mainly depend on the ratio @xmath59 since the mean range of the alignment interaction , @xmath109 $ ] , still depends on @xmath32 and @xmath59 itself , as can be appreciated in figs .",
    "[ fig : size](a ) - [ fig : size](c ) , and not on @xmath41 ( in general , @xmath110 is a function of all the parameters of the system ) .",
    "this is one of the main effects of the correlated angular noise , and allows an increase in the normalized connectivity @xmath59 to translate into an effective increase in the range of the alignment interaction , in position space , with respect to the overall size of the group for any given value of @xmath32 as shown in figs .",

    "in all of the cases @xmath47 and @xmath67 . ]    we must remark that for cases with larger connectivities @xmath111 , when initial conditions are taken in the oscs and for weak noises ( @xmath112 ) , the resulting stationary oscillatory states can present the formation of clusters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : states_cls ] .",
    "this comes as a result of the short - range character of the alignment interaction .",
    "nonetheless , structures like these have been obtained by providing each particle with a short - range repulsive potential @xcite . on the other hand , the clusters ,",
    "when present , seem to be very stable since the exchange of particles is not likely as they oscillate around the center of mass in a limit - cycle fashion .",
    "the segregation of the system in this way is the main cause that the dispersions parallel ( @xmath55 ) and orthogonal ( @xmath56 ) , given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : disps ] ) , are different in figs .",
    "[ fig : size](b ) and [ fig : size](c ) for weak noise intensities .",
    "what happens is that , since the particles are not homogeneously distributed in a circular form around the center of mass , the center of mass itself does not lie in the center of the circular formation but closer to the largest cluster . in consequence ,",
    "the center of mass is able to perform a translational motion rather than a diffusive one .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : states_cls](b ) , where the large arrow points to the trajectory of the center of mass for a finite time .",
    "the exchange of particles among the clusters is more likely when noise increases , in the end leading to the destruction of these structures .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : scaling ] shows a plot of @xmath59 vs.  @xmath0 , and is intended as a scaling analysis of the transition from regions ii to iv .",
    "one can observe that as the number of particles @xmath0 in the system increases , the crossover regime ( solid line with grey circles ) that separates the cases when the bistable region iii is absent , and the transition from the trans to the oscs seems to be continuous with a one - peaked @xmath79 at criticality ( solid black circles above the line ) , from those when a region iii is present and @xmath79 is bimodal ( clear circles below the line ) , moves from lower values of the connectivity @xmath59 to larger ones , finally stabilizing for @xmath113 .",
    "as far as our numerical results indicate , increasing @xmath0 any further does not change the position of the different stability regions for finite values of @xmath59 and @xmath108 .",
    "we have studied the mixed effects of correlated angular noise , centering and alignment interactions in a simple two - dimensional ( 2d ) lagrangian model of @xmath0 self - propelled particles . as a result , we have observed rich dynamics in the collective behavior along with different stability regions as the amplitude of the noise changes .",
    "of particular interest is the development of intermittent behavior as the presence of alignment interactions induce turbulence bursts in the trans where the group is able to even segregate into clusters . during these events ,",
    "the group may present local order but not global , and for certain combinations of the parameters , they allow the system to freely transit from the trans to the oscs and vice versa .",
    "this result is _ distinctive _ from other models where the collective dynamics is condemned to live in monotonous stable states .",
    "indeed , a closer inspection of @xmath79 shows the presence of a tail that deviates from a gaussian distribution and accounts for these turbulence bursts inside region ii , while this behavior is not observed in the case @xmath64 [ see figs .",
    "[ fig : interm](a ) - [ fig : interm](c ) ] .",
    "moreover , increasing the range of the alignment interaction ( by increasing @xmath59 ) enhances this effect that finally leads to a fundamental change in the dynamics of the system as the bistable region iii disappears , and the transition in @xmath69 from the trans of region ii to the oscs of region iv apparently changes its nature to continuous [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : psi](a ) and [ fig : scaling ] ] .",
    "this comes about from the fact that , for large enough connectivities ( @xmath111 ) and subcritical values of @xmath32 closer to the end of region ii , the system becomes fully intermittent as @xmath79 shows a non - gaussian asymmetrical form [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : interm](d ) ] , consequently leading to the existence of region iii and its further disappearance when the connectivity increases .",
    "this strongly suggests what seems to be a clear connection between the intermittent behavior in the collective motion of the group and the kind of phase transitions undergone by its mean velocity .",

    "the dotted lines correspond to gaussian fits of the whole distribution in ( a ) , and of the crest of the distributions in ( b)-(d ) . ]",
    "the kind of dynamics the system develops inside region ii , resembles that in the model of vicsek _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the cluster formation has proven to play an essential role in the development of intermittent dynamics @xcite .",
    "this comes accompanied by a continuous order - disorder phase transition in the mean velocity of the group @xcite .",
    "the intermittent behavior shows up as , in the stationary ordered phase , a laminar regime ( where all the particles move in a rather ordered fashion ) is interrupted by chaotic bursts of turbulence where the system segregates in clusters that may present local order , but not global , in a very similar way as our model does .",
    "moreover , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite reported the cluster formation in a lagrangian model that considers alignment forces , centering , and separation , but with white additive noise .",
    "in fact , intermittent behavior can be observed in other systems far from equilibrium including biological ones ( see references in @xcite ) .    finally , as our numerical simulations show",
    ", the different dynamics displayed by our model seem to be robust even if each particle is provided with a hard - core repulsive potential .",
    "this case is analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the nonlinear way angular noise enters in our model results in the development of an effective individual mean speed that depends on @xmath32 , and in contrast to some other models where it does not @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath16 fluctuates around the value @xmath114 , since @xmath115 depends only on the form of the distribution of the noise .",
