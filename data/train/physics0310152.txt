    "one of the intriguing questions which remain to be answered in bound - state quantum electrodynamics is related to the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values for the lamb shift in ionized helium , or he@xmath0 , which is a hydrogenlike atomic system with a nuclear charge number @xmath3 .",
    "the latest measurement of the `` classical '' lamb shift in he@xmath0 , using the anisotropy method , has led to the result  @xcite @xmath4 the theoretical value given in  @xcite is different : @xmath5 where the uncertainty has been assigned according to an estimate of the magnitude of higher - order contributions which had been unknown . if these higher unknown terms had turned out to increase rather than decrease the value of the lamb shift , then a @xmath6 discrepancy between theory and experiment could have arisen . in the current paper , we review a shift in the theoretical value due to recently calculated higher - order two - loop self - energy corrections , and a further shift due to radiative - recoil corrections where a certain discrepancy between conflicting results has recently been eliminated",
    ".    bound - state quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) energy shifts may be expressed as combined perturbation series in the parameter @xmath7 , which is the fine - structure constant , and in @xmath8 , which is a measure of the electron - nucleus interaction .",
    "although lamb - shift measurements in atomic hydrogen ( @xmath9 ) have a long history , it is necessary to perform at least one measurement for a different value of @xmath10 in order to test the @xmath10-dependence of the corrections , which are generated by bound - state effects and are fundamentally different from the qed of free electrons . in he@xmath0",
    ", we have @xmath3 , and the series in @xmath8 converge much slower than for @xmath9 ( atomic hydrogen ) .    a more accurate measurement of the lamb shift in he@xmath0 is currently being pursued by hinds and boshier  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile to note that he@xmath0 , as it constitutes an ionic system , should also be an attractive candidate for high - precision laser - spectroscopic measurements in traps , where the small doppler shifts associated with the slow movement of the trapped ion could provide a basis for a further significant reduction in the experimental uncertainty .",
    "a detailed summary of radiative corrections which contribute to the lamb shift of @xmath11 states in he@xmath0 has been given in table  i of@xcite .",
    "recently , the understanding of two - loop binding corrections to the lamb shift of s states has been significantly enhanced  @xcite .",

    "we will also use the notations @xmath17 and @xmath13 for the electron mass interchangeably  @xcite , and by @xmath18 , we denote the mass of the @xmath7 particle . ]",
    "these coefficients involve contributions originating from two - loop self - energy , combined self - energy vacuum - polarization , and two - loop vacuum - polarization diagrams .",

    "this is a @xmath34 deviation from the corresponding result for 1s  @xcite which is indicated here in equation  ( [ res1s ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29-correction , for 2s , therefore does not quite enhance the 2s@xmath1 - 2p@xmath1 interval as much as might be expected from the corresponding result for the 1s state [ equation  ( [ res1s ] ) ] .    additionally , we note that the recently available  @xcite nonlogarithmic two - loop terms of order @xmath35 result in a negative energy shift for s states and that the @xmath36-coefficients are surprisingly large ,    [ resb60 ] @xmath37    here , the uncertainty is mainly due to an unknown high - energy contribution to this coefficient .",
    "recent progress has also been reported with regard to recoil corrections of first order in the mass ratio @xmath38 , where @xmath18 is the mass of the atomic nucleus . for hydrogenic systems ,",
    "a nonperturbative evaluation to all orders in @xmath8 has been performed in  @xcite , and the results are in agreement with the known terms of the @xmath8-expansion of this effect .",

    "the sum of these corrections , evaluated for @xmath3 , leads to a satisfactory agreement with the numerical data published in  @xcite for the entire range @xmath42 .",
    "the nonperturbative ( in @xmath8 ) remainder can conservatively be estimated as @xmath43 , which is three times the magnitude of the term of order @xmath44 $ ] ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this term is _ not _ the main source of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "a discrepancy in the analysis of radiative - recoil corrections of order @xmath45 has recently been resolved .",
    "according to the fully analytic calculation  @xcite , the coefficient multiplying this term has the value @xmath46 for s states ( here , @xmath25 is the principal quantum number ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "a slightly different coefficient of @xmath47 had been obtained , whereas in  @xcite , a coefficient of @xmath48 has been given .",
    "assuming the correctness of the most recent evaluation  @xcite , the result for radiative - recoil corrections of order @xmath49 should be taken as @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 .",
    "this concerns the entry termed `` @xmath52 '' in table i of  @xcite which , in units of @xmath53 , is of relative order @xmath54 .    finally , we note that the uncertainty due to the nonperturbative ( in @xmath8 ) one - loop self - energy remainder @xmath55 has recently been eliminated  @xcite : the numerical result reads @xmath56 . for the 2s state of he@xmath0",
    ", the following energy shifts result from the results reported in equations ( [ resb62])([resb60 ] ) :    [ results ] @xmath57    for completeness , we should also note slight inconsistencies in the notation of the corrections in  @xcite . first , in table i of  @xcite , all corrections are given in units of @xmath58 .",
    "the salpeter correction has inadvertently been termed `` @xmath59 '' whereas in units of @xmath58 , it should be termed `` @xmath60 . ''",
    "correspondingly , the correction denoted `` @xmath61 '' should actually be termed `` @xmath62 '' , and the correction denoted as `` @xmath63 '' is of course a correction of ( relative ) order `` @xmath64 . ''",
    "we now discuss the main source of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "there exists an essentially unknown three - loop binding correction of order @xmath65 where we note that the @xmath66-coefficient , in analogy to the two - loop binding correction @xmath67 , might be numerically large . with the estimate @xmath68 for the unknown term , the corresponding additional uncertainty for the 2s state",
    "is @xmath69 .",
    "the nuclear - size contribution to the uncertainty is @xmath70  @xcite ( this is assuming a nuclear radius of @xmath71 ) .",
    "there is an additional @xmath72  uncertainty due to unknown higher - order two - loop corrections for 2p states .",
    "we obtain the following theoretical error budget for the theoretical value of the lamb shift in he@xmath0 :    * unknown high - energy part of @xmath36 : @xmath73 .",
    "* unknown higher - order two - loop effects for p states : @xmath74 .",
    "* unknown three - loop binding correction @xmath66 : @xmath75 .",
    "* nonperturbative remainder of nuclear recoil : @xmath43 . * uncertainty in the nuclear charge radius : @xmath76",
    ".    the @xmath77 particle charge radius has been determined to high accuracy in  @xcite , using spectroscopic experimental data from the system @xmath78he@xmath79 .",
    "however , the accuracy of the resulting charge radius of @xmath71 has been questioned ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the result obtained in combining scattering experiments",
    "is @xmath80  @xcite and has a considerably larger error .",
    "the above entry in the error budget should therefore rather be interpreted as a lower limit of this problematic contribution .",
    "because theoretical errors can not be expected to follow a normal distribution like experimental errors , there exists no universally adopted procedure for the determination of a total theoretical error in a situation where several unknown terms contribute to an error budget . in the current work , we choose to ( conservatively ) add the above errors in order to obtain a total theoretical uncertainty of @xmath81 . to complete the discussion",
    ", we mention that ( i ) under the assumption of normally distributed theoretical errors , the total theoretical uncertainty would be reduced to @xmath82 , and ( ii ) under the assumption of a @xmath83 uncertainty in the nuclear radius  @xcite , the theoretical error due to the @xmath7 particle charge radius alone would be @xmath84 .",
    "we have re - evaluated theoretical predictions for the @xmath85@xmath86 lamb shift in he@xmath0 . taking into account recently evaluated corrections to the entries in table i of  @xcite ( see equation  ( [ results ] ) ) ,",
    "we obtain the new theoretical value of    @xmath87    where the first error is due to the error budget as discussed above , and the second error results due to the nuclear size alone , if we assign a larger nuclear charge radius uncertainty of @xmath88  @xcite instead of @xmath89  @xcite . for the 2p@xmath902s@xmath1-interval ,",
    "the new theoretical prediction is @xmath91    with the same error budgets as for @xmath92 .",
    "there remains a small discrepancy between the `` new '' theoretical value of @xmath93 ( equation  ( [ nuth2s2p12 ] ) ) and the experimental result of @xmath94 given in equation  ( [ nuexp ] ) .",
    "however , this discrepancy is less severe than the difference of the experimental value  ( [ nuexp ] ) and the `` old '' theoretical value of @xmath95 ( see equation ( [ nuthold ] ) ) .",
    "the sum of the experimental ( @xmath96 ) and the theoretical uncertainty ( @xmath97 ) is @xmath98 .",
    "this should be compared to the difference @xmath99 between the theoretical and experimental `` expectation values '' ( [ nuth2s2p12 ] ) and ( [ nuexp ] ) .",
    "the difference @xmath100 corresponds to @xmath101 .",
    "if we assign the larger error of @xmath83 to the nuclear radius , then the discrepancy shrinks to @xmath102 .",
    "even though a difference of @xmath102 to @xmath101 between theory and experiment remains somewhat unsettling , it is not large enough to be regarded as statistically significant . even at this level , it still represents a better test of the unexpectedly large @xmath103 two - loop binding correction to the lamb shift ( 1.339 mhz ) than that provided by the corresponding measurement in hydrogen .",
    "in addition , the anisotropy method provides a completely independent method of measuring the lamb shift that is not limited by the large level width of the @xmath104 state(s ) , and it is the only method that is capable of comparing two different atomic or ionic species ( h and he@xmath0 , c.f .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) within the same apparatus .",
    "it may also be beneficial , in the near future , to re - analyze the results of the most recent measurement  @xcite in terms of qed corrections to the @xmath85@xmath104 transition matrix elements which are currently under study  @xcite . in the current paper , we restrict the discussion to the _ theoretical _ predictions for the absolute frequency of the @xmath85@xmath104 transitions .",
    "further clarification of this and related questions will certainly benefit from a reduction of the experimental uncertainty of the lamb - shift measurement to @xmath105100 khz or better , as is currently being pursued by hinds and boshier  @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that all theoretical predictions for transitions in he@xmath0 rely on the single available accurate determination of the charge radius of the @xmath7-particle as described in  @xcite .",
    "there is still a lack of accurate independent verifications of this determination of the charge radius . in the end",
    ", the answer to a number of questions related to lamb - shift measurements in atomic hydrogen and he@xmath0 might be as easy as a slight deviation of the proton and @xmath7 particle charge radii from their currently accepted values .",
    "however , other , more subtle explanations can not be ruled out at present , either .",
