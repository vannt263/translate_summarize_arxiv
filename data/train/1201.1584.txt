    "an important milestone in planetary astronomy is the discovery of a jupiter - mass planet , 51 peg b @xcite .",
    "its extraordinary 4 day orbital period rekindled a theoretical expectation that protoplanets may undergo orbital decay @xcite as a consequence of their tidal interaction with their natal disks .",
    "today , more than 500 planets have been discovered around nearby stars . among them , there is a pile up of @xmath0100 planets with periods ( @xmath1 ) less than a week and mass ( @xmath2 ) two orders of magnitude larger than that of the earth ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "transit observations of some of these planets indicate that they have a radius and density comparable to that of jupiter and saturn and are commonly referred to as hot jupiters .",
    "these hot jupiters , including 51 peg b , were formed in presumably at some preferred locations ( beyond the snow line ) of their natal disks @xcite . after acquiring sufficient masses to open gaps in their natal disk ,",
    "they undergo type ii migration along with the viscous diffusion of their surrounding gas . in order to account for their survival",
    ", we proposed that the migration of 51 peg b and other short - period gas giant planets may have stalled when they entered into the magnetospheric cavity of their host star during their infancy @xcite . since protostellar disks are expected to be truncated within the magnetosphere of their central stars ( see below ) , once any protoplanet enters into this region , its migration would slow to a halt as the intensity of its tidal interaction with its nascent disk weakens .",
    "the existence of magnetosphere around t tauri stars was proposed @xcite to account for the observed period distribution which peaks around 8 days @xcite .",
    "if efficient angular momentum flow between protostellar disks and the magnetosphere of their central stars can enforce corotation at their interface where the magnetic and viscous torques are balanced @xcite , we would infer kilogauss fields . today , zeeman splitting of emission lines",
    "have been directly measured for many t tauri stars and these observations confirm the presence of kilogauss fields on their surface @xcite .",
    "if this field strength represents that of a dipole stellar field , the magnetospheric radius for t tauri stars with accretion rates in the range of @xmath4 yr@xmath5 would extend to regions beyond the orbits of their close - in planets .",
    "the radius of this magnetospheric cavity expands during the depletion of the disk gas and the decline of the accretion flux through the disk .",
    "although the magnetospheric - cavity scenario provides a useful qualitative model for the abundant population of short - period planets , a detailed reconstruction of the observed period distribution requires a quantitative determination of short - period planets retention efficiency .",
    "after they have entered the magnetospheric cavity of their host stars or after they have been engulfed by the magnetospheric cavity , protoplanets continue to interact with the stellar magnetic field .",
    "it is not clear whether this process can induce planets to undergo further orbital interaction .    in order to understand the nature of this physical mechanism , we carry out a series of investigations . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we provided a general description of the relevant physical effects .",
    "we first consider the retention of short - period gas giant planets inside the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "we decompose the stellar magnetic field into a steady and a periodically modulating component and the planet into a day and night side . in this previous investigation",
    ", we considered the periodically modulating component of the field which can be due to either the planet s eccentric orbit or the star s non - synchronous ( with respect to the planet s orbital angular frequency ) and non - aligned ( with respect to the star s magnetic poles ) spin . on the night side of the planet where the magnetic diffusivity is relatively high , this time - dependent field can permeate into the planet s envelope and induce an ac current .",
    "the ohmic dissipation of this current not only heats the planet but also provides a torque which drives the planet s orbit toward a state of circularization and synchronization with the star s spin .",
    "we also found that close to the host star where the stellar magnetosphere is intense , ohmic dissipation can cause a planet s interior to heat up such that it expands and overflows its roche lobe . the gas flow from the planet to its host star via the inner lagrangian point also transfers angular momentum to the orbit of the planet @xcite .",
    "this process can halt the migration of the planet despite its loss of angular momentum as a consequence of its tidal interaction with the disk and the host star and the direct torque applied by the stellar magnetosphere on it .",
    "the results of this analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "another class of planets have been discovered with @xmath6 a few @xmath3 and @xmath1 in the range of a few days to 2 months .",
    "in contrast to their jupiter - mass siblings , these planets probably have rocky or icy internal structures and are commonly referred to as super - earths @xcite .",
    "recently kepler mission led to the discovery of over 1200 planetary candidates .",
    "since they all have radii more than twice that of the earth , they may also be super - earths , albeit their masses are yet to be determined .",
    "these super - earths too are probably formed at locations ranging from a fraction to several aus from their host stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gas giants , super - earths may not have adequate mass to open a gap and undergo type ii migration .",
    "nevertheless , they do tidally interact with their natal disk and undergo type i migration , due to an imbalance between the torque they exert on the disk at the lindblad and corotation resonances both interior and exterior to their orbits @xcite .    in most regions of the disk , type i migration",
    "is directed inward . however , due to the corotation torque , there are migration barriers where the orbital decay of isolated super - earths may be halted @xcite .",
    "these barriers occur at gas surface density ( @xmath7 ) maximum near the snow line ( @xmath8 where water vapor condensate ) , at the inner edge of a dead zone ( @xmath9 where the ionization fraction near the mid plane is too small to maintain coupling between turbulent magnetic field and disk gas ) , and just outside the magnetospheric cavity , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath7 and the mid - plane temperature of the disk decline with time , the location of these barriers also evolves with them . during the advanced stages of disk evolution , @xmath7 may be sufficiently small that the dead zone essentially vanishes and the stalled embryos near @xmath8 and @xmath9 resume their migration .",
    "assuming the field strength decreases slowly or remains unchanged , the location of @xmath10 also expands beyond the orbital semimajor axis of the super - earths , @xmath11 , during the transition from classical to weak - line t tauri phases on a timescale of @xmath12 myr @xcite . after the disk depletion , the stellar magnetic field and spin rate decrease @xcite on a timescale @xmath13 myr @xcite . during these evolutionary stages ,",
    "the location ( @xmath14 ) where the frequency of the keplerian motion matches that of the stellar spin also evolve relative to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we anticipate that some super - earths are located interior to the corotation radius while others are located beyond it .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the interaction between close - in super - earths with the steady component of their host stars magnetic field . beside differences between their masses and radii ,",
    "rocky planets have much larger electric conductivity on their surface than the envelope and atmosphere on the night side of close - in young gas giant planets .",
    "the dayside of gas giant planets is exposed to the stellar ionizing photons and may have much higher ionization fraction and electrical conductivities than their night side .",
    "we will consider this more complex aspect of the hot jupiter problem elsewhere .",
    "the super - earth problem we are considering here is analogous to the _ echo _ satellite ( in the form of a conductor ) moving relative to background ( earth ) field line which was analyzed by drell et al .",
    "( 1965 ) . in general , an electric field is induced across the conductor ( in directions orthogonal to the field and motion ) .",
    "however , the electric field must vanish ( in its frame ) inside a perfect conductor ( with an infinite conductivity ) . on its surface ,",
    "the electric field generate a current which leads to an induced magnetic field .",
    "the induced field cancels the unperturbed field inside the conductor so that there is no relative motion between the perfect conductor and the net ( unperturbed plus induced ) field inside it .",
    "outside the moving conductor , the net field appears to wrap around it . at large distances from the moving conductor , the induced field propagates away from it with the alfven speed .    in a slightly different context ,",
    "goldreich and lynden - bell ( 1969 ) analyzed the electrodynamic interaction between io and jupiter .",
    "they treated io as a conductor moving in jupiter s magnetosphere .",
    "because io s conductivity is larger than that of jupiter , it drags a flux tube of field lines .",
    "they showed that an electromagnetic field is induced across io s surface .",
    "provided the conductivity is high along and low across the field lines , the electric potential drop across them would propagate and be maintained along the field lines connecting io and jupiter with an alfven speed . at the foot of the flux tube where it enters into jupiter s atmosphere and envelope , conductivity across the field lines increases with the density of the surrounding gas such that the potential drop drives a dc current across the potential drop . provided that the induced field can propagate back to io before the unperturbed field slips through it , the current forms a close circuit . in this scenario ,",
    "io acts as a unipolar inductor .    in this paper , we apply the goldreich and lynden - bell s model to the study of a super - earth moving in its host star s magnetosphere . for computational simplicity , we neglect the planet s intrinsic magnetic field , as we have done in the previous paper . in the problem we are considering , a steady component of the stellar magnetic field is present regardless of the differential motion between the star s spin and the planet s orbit .",
    "in an asynchronous system , a flux tube of magnetic field between the planet and the star can not be infinitely anchored on both entities .",
    "if the planet s conductivity is smaller than that on the surface of the host star , the flux tube would tend to be anchored on the surface of the star along with all other unperturbed field lines and it would slip through the planet .",
    "in section 2 , we introduce qualitative discussion and schematic illustration to show in the limit that the electric conductivity in the super - earth planet is higher ( but not by an infinite amount ) than that of its host star s envelope , the relative motion between the planet and the stellar magnetic field leads to an induced emf and a potential drop across the planet . outside the planet",
    ", a flux tube of ( unperturbed plus induced ) magnetic fields would appear to be approximately anchored on the planet . in the tenuous regions between the planet and its host star ,",
    "the conductivity along the field lines is much higher than that across them and the electric current flows freely to maintain constant electric potential along them . in the absence of field reconnection",
    ", alfven waves propagate to infinity on open lines and the electric current flows to the surface of the host stars along closed field lines . due to the finite resistance of the surrounding ( stellar ) gas , the foot of the flux tube on the surface of the host star slips through the stellar atmosphere and the electrical potential drop across the foot of the flux tube drives an electric current with an associated rate of ohmic dissipation .    based on the above qualitative scenario ,",
    "we construct a quantitative model in this paper . in section 3 , we introduce the values of the different parameters we use in the numerical applications and derive the analytical expressions for the induced electric field , intensity , ohmic dissipation , and torque . in our numerical applications ,",
    "we adopt a set of fiducial physical parameters for a rocky super - earth planet with two earth radii , @xmath15 m on a 3 day circular orbit ( @xmath16 m around a t tauri star with a mass equals to that of the sun ( @xmath17 kg ) and a radius twice that of the sun @xmath18 m .",
    "we also assume that it has a solar luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , a surface temperature of @xmath20k , and a dipole field with a strength 0.2 t ( i.e. @xmath21 g ) on the stellar surface ( which corresponds to a magnetic dipole strength of @xmath22 ) .    with these parameters ,",
    "we first analyze two limiting cases of rapid and slow stellar spin .",
    "we discuss the condition of validity of the model in section 4 and derive in section 5 the expressions and values of the resistances and alfven speed .",
    "we will consider more general sets of model parameters elsewhere . in section 6",
    ", we calculate the values of the induced intensity , ohmic dissipation , and torque , and discuss the relevance of these values . in the context of planetary migration in the presence of their natal disk , we show that if the planet orbits around the host star outside its corotation radius ( i.e. the keplerian frequency of the planet s orbit is smaller than the stellar spin frequency ) , the net torque associated with this induced current would provide an adequate rate of angular momentum transfer to balance against the rate of tidally induced angular momentum loss by the rocky planet to the disk . in the limit",
    "that the planet is inside its host star s corotation radius , the planet s orbit would continue to decay .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss their implications in section 7 .",
    "we consider a rocky planet with a mass of several @xmath3 moving in the dipole magnetic field of the star it is orbiting .",
    "the relative motion of such a conductor in an external stellar magnetic field generates an induced emf across the planet .",
    "there are two complementary effects ( see paper 1 ) described by the complete magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equation : the diffusion of the magnetic field in the planet and the magnetic induction ( with its associated drag ) .",
    "the mhd equation describing the electrodynamics of the planet in the stellar field can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnetic diffusivity ( which is equal to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the electric conductivity ) .    in paper 1",
    ", we focused on the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field inside a hot jupiter . in order to do so , we considered the periodic component of the stellar magnetic field felt by a planet when the axis of the stellar magnetic moment is not aligned with the planetary orbital axis , or when the planet is on an eccentric orbit .",
    "the drag of the magnetic field by the planet due to induction can be neglected if the planet s orbit co - rotates with the star s spin or if the electrical conductivity of the planet is low compared with that of the outer layers of the star ( which is the case at least in the night side of a hot - jupiter ) .    in this limit",
    ", the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field inside the planet is modulated by the electric conductivity ( inversely proportional to the magnetic diffusivity ) profile in the planet .",
    "a somewhat higher electric conductivity in the planet would tend to decrease the penetration depth of the stellar magnetic field and the volume where the electric current induced by the field can be dissipated , but it would also increase the volumic ohmic ( power ) dissipation rate . likewise , a lower conductivity in the planet would enable the stellar magnetic field to penetrate deeper into it , albeit the induced current also encounters a lower volumic ohmic dissipation rate .",
    "consequently , we found that , the total ohmic dissipation rate over the entire planet does not change significantly over a reasonable range of electric conductivity for a hot - jupiter ( neglecting the effect of photo - ionization in its atmosphere ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe the induction ( and associated `` drag '' of the field lines ) which was neglected in paper i. for simplicity , we neglect the damping of the magnetic field in the planet associated with the diffusion term and focus on the case where the planet is able to significantly drag the stellar magnetic field lines which are enclosed in the flux tube that passes through the planet .    throughout this paper , this `` flux tube which passes through the planet '' is simply referred to as `` the flux tube '' ( we are interested in the part that extends between the interior of the planet and above the surface of the star ) .",
    "the  foot of the flux tube `` refers to that part of the flux tube which extends below the surface of the star for a distance @xmath27 ( the subscript ' ' pn \" refers to penetration ) to be estimated below .    between the planet and the surface of the star ,",
    "the volumic current flows along the flux tube ( parallel to the magnetic field lines  the electrons in fact gyrate around the magnetic field lines ) , but the volumic current crosses the flux tube in the planet and at the foot of the flux tube ( perpendicular to the magnetic field lines in the stellar atmosphere ) . figures 1 and 2 present the general overview of the system .     [ overview ]     and @xmath28 which defines the geometry of the foot of the flux tube ]    .",
    "[ geometry ]    in this model , we make a distinction between the regular ( unperturbed ) stellar dipole magnetic field ( magnetosphere ) which co - rotates with the stellar spin and the field lines which define the flux tube ( composed of both the stellar field in the planet and the induced flux tube ) which appear to be dragged along with the planet and thus move relative to the rest of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "this drag is significant when the electric conductivity of the planet is large compared to that of the outer layers of the star @xcite .",
    "a large conductivity in the planet s interior would lead to a large surface current which induces a field and cancels the external ( unperturbed stellar dipole ) field . with small magnetic diffusivity",
    ", the planet s interior would appear to be shielded from any time dependent external magnetic field .",
    "we , therefore , consider only the time - independent component of the stellar magnetic field . in this model ,",
    "the time - independent component of the stellar magnetic field permeates the planet .",
    "the motion of the planet relative to the stellar magnetosphere induces an electric field @xmath29 , an induced volumic electric current @xmath30 , and an induced difference of potential u across the planet s diameter . in figure",
    "[ fig : planet ] , we provide a schematic illustration on the field lines and current inside the planet .        for the flux tube between the planet and its host star ,",
    "we adopt the assumption of high electric conductivity along the magnetic field lines and low conductivity across them which was introduced by goldreich & lyndenbell ( 1969 ) for the system io - jupiter . in this case",
    ", the difference of electric potential ( induced by the planet s relative motion with respect to the magnetic field of its host star ) drives an electrical current out of the planet , along the flux tube , across its foot on the atmosphere of the star , and back to the planet along its other half ( figure 1 ) .    in the limit of negligible electrical conductivity in the direction normal to the flux tube",
    ", the electric current can only cross the field lines in the planet or in the atmosphere of the host star .",
    "the assumption of high electric conductivity along the magnetic field lines also implies 1 ) that the difference of potential u across the planet s diameter is transmitted along the flux tube without significant drop in potential and 2 ) that the plasma enclosed in the flux tube is dragged along by the motion of the magnetic field lines .",
    "an electric circuit is therefore created , where the flux tube acts as electric wires , the planet as a unipolar inductor with internal resistance @xmath31 , and the foot of the flux tube as the largest resistance .",
    "we see that there are in fact two circuits ( see figure 1 ) . the first one is composed of the foot of the flux tube on the northern hemisphere of the star , its corresponding flux tube , and the northern hemisphere of the planet .",
    "the second is equivalent and symmetric to the first one ( the plane of symmetry being the plane of the planetary disk ) . except when explicitly stated , the calculations ( current , resistances , ohmic dissipation , torques , etc . ) describe only one circuit ( the northern one ) .    in an electric circuit composed of a generator ( with an emf @xmath32 and resistance @xmath33 over a length scale @xmath34 ) and other resistances along the circuit @xmath35 ( here primarily the resistance of the foot of the flux tube ) , the intensity of the current @xmath36 is determined by @xmath37 . with the parameters we have adopted here , we show in section 5 that the resistance along the flux tube @xmath38 and the resistance across the planet @xmath39 are small",

    "1 ) the potential drop across the planet with a radius @xmath41 is @xmath42 , 2 ) the magnitude @xmath43 is approximately constant along each field lines in the flux tube between the planet and its host star because the resistance of the tube @xmath38 and the induction are negligible , and 3 ) the total current is determined by the largest resistance along the circuit , _",
    "i.e. _ that at the foot of the flux tube in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "except when explicitly stated otherwise , we consider a system composed of a super - earth orbiting closely a young t - tauri star with a time - independent magnetic dipole .",
    "we assume that the magnetosphere co - rotates with the star , and adopt the following numerical values ( si units ) for the parameters intervening in the model :    for the star we adopt the following model parameters : + temperature of the isothermal outer layer : @xmath44 k , + radius : @xmath45 m , + mass : @xmath46 kg , + opacity at the photosphere : @xmath47 @xmath48 ( which is equivalent to taking a surface pressure of about 15 pa ) , + magnetic dipole strength : @xmath49 @xmath50 , which corresponds to a magnetic field of 0.2 t ( tesla ) @xmath51 gs ( gauss ) at the stellar surface @xcite , and + spin period : 8 days ( slow - rotator ) or 0.8 days ( fast - rotator ) .",

    "the rate of energy dissipation per surface area at the foot of the flux tube would be about @xmath326 which is three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic radiative flux from the surface of a typical t tauri star .",
    "since @xmath327 , most of the dissipation occurs in the region between @xmath95 and @xmath272 .",
    "we note that the density scale at the photosphere ( @xmath328 ) , @xmath329 m is much smaller than @xmath330 m and @xmath331 m .",
    "when the dissipated energy emerges from the stellar photosphere , the actual area of the hot spot may be diffused to several times the area of the foot of the flux tube .",

    "we will construct a self consistent model in a follow - up analysis .      in paper",
    "i , we considered the structural adjustment due to ohmic dissipation . in this paper",
    ", we have not yet considered the structure adjustment of super - earth structure due to ohmic dissipation . for the slow - rotator model",
    ", the rate of ohmic dissipation is six times that the planet receives from its host star s irradiation . in the absence of any structural adjustment ,",
    "the super - earth may attain a thermal equilibrium with an effective blackbody temperature @xmath3342,300 k ( and much higher for the fast - rotator model ) . with this temperature ,",
    "planet s core crust would surrounded by an ocean and an extensive atmosphere where water and hydrogen molecules readily dissociate but their ionization fraction remains negligible .",
    "the local density scale height is @xmath335 where @xmath336    the density scale height of the hydrogen atoms is much larger than that of all other elements including carbon , oxygen , and silicates .",
    "the mean free path for a hydrogen atom to collide with an heavy element with a density @xmath337 is @xmath338 where @xmath339 m@xmath340 is a typical cross section . within @xmath341 hydrogen",
    "atoms scale heights there are so few heavy - elemental atoms left , they essentially become thermally decoupled , i.e. @xmath342 for hydrogen atoms .",
    "we refer this location as the decoupling radius @xmath343 and the local hydrogen density at @xmath344 as @xmath345 ) .",
    "the local temperature @xmath346 is set by the blackbody temperature @xmath347 of the heavy elements in the planet s photosphere .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath348 for a rocky or icy planet can be estimated to be @xmath349 where typical fractional abundance of the hydrogen atoms @xmath350 .",
    "next , we consider the possibility of significant loss of hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "planetary outflow is usually analyzed in the limit that atmosphere is heated by stellar irradiation . for the present configuration ,",
    "simple estimates indicate that the hydrogen atmosphere is opaque to incident ionizing photons from the host star , i.e. they are mostly absorbed by hydrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere .",
    "provided hydrogen atmosphere remains mostly atomic , most visual stellar photons would stream pass it and be absorbed by heavy elements near @xmath41 .",
    "transit light curves of such a super earth in ly @xmath351 photons would be much deeper than that for visual photons , as in the case of hd 209458b , @xcite . thus , most regions of the atmosphere is not affected by either ohmic dissipation or irradiation .",
    "the most important heat input is the ohmic dissipation which takes place at the base of the atmosphere .",
    "if we neglect energy deposition and loss in the atmosphere , our problem would reduce to a simple spherical bondi ( or parker ) solution . in a steady state , the governing continuity and momentum equations at a location @xmath229 would reduce to @xmath352 @xmath353 where the last term represents host star s tidal force @xcite and @xmath354 is the radial velocity .",
    "together they reduce to @xmath355 transonic point ( where @xmath356 ) occurs @xcite near the roche radius @xmath357 .",
    "interior to the transonic point , flow is subsonic .    in order to make further progress",
    ", we need to estimate the energy budget of the atmosphere . at the base of the atmosphere ,",
    "ohmic dissipation occurs primarily due to collision of charged ( provided by the heavy elements ) and neutral particles .",
    "most of the dissipated energy is emitted to space at @xmath41 as blackbody radiation . below @xmath344 ,",
    "hydrogen atoms attain @xmath358k ) through conduction as all other particles . above @xmath344 ,",
    "hydrogen atoms attain different density distribution .    for computation simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider an isothermal equation of state . for an analytic approximation ,",
    "we neglect the advection contribution to the momentum equation and obtain @xmath359 at large distances ( @xmath360 ) but still well within @xmath361 cm @xmath362 ) , hydrogen s density approaches to an isochoric limiting value @xmath363 kg m@xmath364 .",
    "the mass loss rate at @xmath365 @xcite becomes @xmath366 at this rate , the total hydrogen mass in the planet @xmath367 is depleted in a few myr .",
    "note that hydrogen atoms contained within this region is negligible compared with @xmath2 as we have assumed in the momentum equation .",
    "in addition , the collisional mean free path between hydrogen atoms @xmath368 is small compared the density scale height @xmath369 and more importantly @xmath365 . in this limits ,",
    "it is more appropriate consider outflow in the hydrodynamic limit @xcite , as we have done above , rather than use the jeans escape formula @xcite .",
    "if the planet s atmosphere is maintained above the recombination temperature so that it is primarily compose of hydrogen atoms , the main cooling process would be the emission of ly @xmath68 photons at a rate @xmath370 after integrating over the entire volume @xmath371 , the total energy loss rate is @xmath372 watt which is substantially below fraction of the dissipated energy flux ( @xmath373 ) carried by the hydrogen atoms .",
    "( in the above estimate , we use the asymptotic value of @xmath374 to estimate @xmath375 . )",
    "however , with the magnitude of @xmath376 in equation ( [ eq : mdot ] ) , we find that a significant fraction of @xmath373 may be advected with the escape hydrogen gas .    based on hydrogen atoms ineffective absorption and emission rates , it is natural to contemplate the possibility that the planet s atmosphere expands adiabatically . in the limit",
    "that ohmic dissipation provides the only source of heating at its base , planet s atmosphere may be convectively unstable .",
    "efficient convection also leads to constant entropy .    using the conventional polytropic approximation ( in which @xmath377 and @xmath378 ) for an adiabatic hydrogen atmosphere ,",
    "a stationary quasi hydrostatic solution can be constructed with @xmath379 the above equation implies that with an adiabatic equation of state , both density and temperature in the hydrogen atmosphere vanishes within @xmath380 . unless planet s photospheric radius can expand ( see paper i ) significantly , there would be no outflow , despite the intense ohmic dissipation below @xmath41 , and all the thermal energy generated would efficiently radiated by atomic emission from heavy elements .",
    "however , planet s atmosphere may be heated to prevent its temperature from plummeting below that ( @xmath381k ) for hydrogen molecules to recombine . rotational and vibrational bands of hydrogen molecules not only provide emission mechanisms but also opacity sources to absorb the incident stellar irradiation and to diffuse thermal energy in the planet s atmosphere from its heated base to its upper layers . in the mildly heated case , we anticipate the planet s hydrogen atmosphere to attain an equilibrium temperature so that the incident deposition of stellar photon energy would be balanced by planet s reprocessed luminosity .",
    "( for our fiducial model , the equilibrium temperature is @xmath382k . ) in this limit , the loss of planet s hydrogen atmosphere relies more critically on the atmosphere ability to maintain a shallow temperature gradient than that to generate energy through ohmic dissipation .",
    "this situation has already been analyzed in the context of hd 209458b @xcite .",
    "however , enhanced sources of energy may also expand the radius of planet s photosphere well beyond @xmath41 .",
    "this is a distinctive possibility for the fast - rotator model in which case @xmath103 is another 18 times larger .",
    "this increase in the ohmic dissipation rate is due to the relatively large differential motion between the planet and the magnetosphere of its host star .",
    "if the planet s photosphere remains at @xmath41 , the enhanced energy source would increase @xmath347 by a factor of 2 which is comparable to the magnitude of @xmath383 .",
    "at this temperature , opacity due to h@xmath384 process becomes significant .",
    "planet s envelope and photosphere may well expand , leading to a possible runaway ohmic heating .",
    "the above discussion clearly warrants further discussions and detailed treatments of radiation transfer in this type of super earths we shall carry out and present these analysis in a future paper .",
    "the loss of planet s atmospheric hydrogen is likely to occur on a more rapid pace .",
    "it remains to be demonstrated that for the intense heating cases , how far up in the atmosphere does thermal decoupling between hydrogen and heavy elements occur .",
    "if the planet s photosphere is well within @xmath365 , the density scale height of most other heavy elements such as carbon and oxygen above are sufficiently small that they may be effectively retained near @xmath41 .",
    "oxygen atoms may combine with mg , fe , ca , na , al , and ti silicates to form high - density minerals such as enstatites , olivines , and pyroxenes .",
    "planets composed mostly such substances are expected to have compact sizes ( valencia et al . 2010 ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that super earths which migrated early to the proximity of their strongly magnetized host stars may attain relatively compact sizes as in the case of corot 7-b @xcite and planets around kepler 11 .",
    "the rate of ohmic dissipation in short - period super earths is likely to diminish as their host stars magnetic field weakens with age . as their semimajor axis increases , planets which undergo outward migration around rapidly spinning host stars also encounter less intense stellar dipole field .",
    "some residual oxygen atoms in the atmosphere may recombine to form oxygen molecules during the decline of the ohmic dissipation rate .",
    "oxygen molecules are particularly important because they have been suggested as a bio - marker for the detection of life elsewhere in the universe @xcite .",
    "we presented here a preliminary model for the unipolar induction model .",
    "some approximations were made for computational convenience , and we briefly discuss here the validity of the approximations which have not yet been discussed in the paper .",
    "we only took into account hydrogen for the calculation of the conductivity / resistance of the star . in a realistic model , especially for low - mass stars",
    ", other elements may become important contributors of the ionization fraction .",
    "a more comprehensive study will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in addition , we suggested that the foot of the flux tube at the stellar atmosphere would be significantly heated .",
    "however , we used t=4000k for the stellar surface temperature ( usual t tauri star ) .",
    "the feedback on the stellar temperature due to the circuit may be included in later models .",
    "_ for the evaluation of the planet",
    "s electrical resistivity_. the value we adopted ( @xmath385 ohm ) seems to be the most uncertain value in our calculation .",
    "this value of the resistance of the planet used here is likely to be a lower boundary for the mantle of the planet ( a metallic core might have even higher conductivity ) . if the real resistance where to be lower , then 1 ) the time @xmath152 available for the alfven waves to travel around the circuit would increase , which would result in a deeper foot of the flux tube and would also enable the model to hold for larger semi - major axes and 2 ) the ohmic dissipation in the planet would decrease",
    "nevertheless , an increase in the depth of the foot of the flux tube would not affect much the total resistance of the foot of the flux tube @xmath105 .",
    "_ induction at the foot of the flux tube_. since the conductivity is very high along the magnetic field lines , the plasma in the star s magnetosphere rotates with the magnetic field lines .",
    "therefore , the plasma contained in the flux tube also moves with the magnetic field lines as they are dragged along by the planet , and thus moves relative to the unperturbed magnetic field line .",
    "therefore , just as the induction in the planet is due to the relative motion between the frame co - moving with the planet and the frame rotating with the magnetosphere , there can also be a magnetic induction in the plasma enclosed by the foot of the flux tube .",
    "the order of magnitude of this phenomenon will be at most comparable to the order of magnitude of the phenomenon presently described .",
    "ferraro & plumpton ( 1966 ) provide a brief discussion of the problems raised by two good concentric conductors rotating in a magnetic field at different angular speeds .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there may be magnetic reconnection if the induced field dominate over the unperturbed stellar dipole field .",
    "the field lines also tend to wrap around the planet when the synodic period ( @xmath386 ) is small compared to @xmath152 , the time required for the field lines constituting the flux tube to move across the diameter of the planet . using ( [ tmax ] ) , we find that @xmath387 with @xmath388 . for our parameters",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath389 ( using @xmath390 ohm according to ( [ resistance planet ] ) and @xmath293 ohm according to section ( [ sec : depth ] ) ) .",
    "this also provides an upper limit on the ratio of resistances w in order to stay with a model without reconnection . indeed",
    ", magnetic reconnection may occur when @xmath152 is larger than a few @xmath391 , and one would thus arguably stay in the regime without frequent magnetic reconnection when @xmath392 with k larger than 1 , and w as defined above . using @xmath393 and a= 0.04au , we find @xmath394 . we have neglected the resistance of the flux tube @xmath191 in front of @xmath31 and @xmath105 but this approximation may break down in extreme cases .",
    "nevertheless , in most cases , equation ( [ upper limit ] ) means that @xmath395 is smaller than 1300 .",
    "the resistance of the planet depends mainly on its composition , and structure , which would adjust to the strong ohmic dissipation in its interior .",
    "the resistance of the foot of the flux tube in the stellar atmosphere would depend on the metallicity and the temperature , which would also adjust to the strong ohmic dissipation .",
    "previously in the paper , we also discussed that the travel time of the alfven wave can be at most @xmath152 ( equation ( [ time condition ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath105 , through its relationship with the variable depth of penetration , would self - consistently adjust depending on the parameters of the model . indeed",
    ", larger @xmath105 leads to larger w , then larger @xmath152 , and thus larger depth of penetration since the alfven waves have more time to travel between the planet and the star along the flux tube , into the stellar atmosphere at the foot of the flux tube , and back to the planet .",
    "deeper depth of penetration then results in smaller @xmath105 ( equivalent resistance with resistances in parallel ) .",
    "the value @xmath31 is less directly constrained by the model although it of course depends on the parameters chosen for the model .",
    "nevertheless , changes in the value of @xmath31 would result in adjustments in @xmath105 through the mechanism mentioned just above .",
    "goldreich and lynden - bell also interpret the torque calculated above ( section [ sec : numerical values ] ) in terms of a toroidal magnetic stress due to a distortion of @xmath396 in the azimuthal direction , i.e. the direction of the motion .",
    "neglecting the induced field in the @xmath397 ( meridional ) direction , they determined the longitude of the flux tube from the ratio of the induced @xmath396 and the unperturbed stellar - dipole field .",
    "they then determined , for the jupiter - io system , the forward - sweeping angle ( or the backward- sweeping angle in the case of a slowly rotating star ) of each field line as it leaves the io to be 13 deg . when a similar approach is adopted in the present model , we find this angle may be close to 90 deg .",
    "this large distortion is due to a strong torque induced by the unipolar circuit with a relatively small @xmath105 ( and thus a large intensity ) .",
    "for such a large field distortion , goldreich and lynden - bell suggested that the induction circuit may be broken by field reconnection .",
    "we shall further examine this possibility elsewhere and determine whether it may significantly weaken the effective torque .",
    "with the advent of high - precision radial velocity and transit surveys , we have entered an era of super - earth discovery .",
    "although the detection probability ( due to observational selection effects ) decreases with planets period , three times more planets are found with period between 3 and 10 days than between 1 and 3 days .",
    "we suggest that super - earths interaction with the magnetosphere of their host stars may be one possible mechanism for this dichotomy .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the electrodynamics of super earths orbiting in the proximity of strongly magnetized t tauri stars .",
    "we constructed a fiducial model in which the planet s orbital frequency is not synchronized with the star s spin .",
    "their relative motion enables the planet to continually encounter field lines which are locked on the star . as a good ( but not perfect ) conductor",
    ", an emf is induced across the planet ( along the semi - major axis ) .",
    "we estimate planet s conductivity and show that the stellar fields slip through the planet with a drift speed considerably slower than its keplerian speed .",
    "we show that conductivity along the field line is likely to be large and the perturbed potential ( due to the induced electric field ) propagates along a flux tube away from the planet with an alfven speed .",
    "we show that for planets with period less than 3 or so days , the disturbance can reach the surface of the star and return before stellar fields have drifted through the planet .",
    "the foot of the flux tube is implanted to stellar surface . as density increases with depth below the photosphere , the alfven speed decreases .",
    "penetration depth of the flux tube is determined by the condition that the timescale required for alfven waves to complete a circuit between the planet and its host star is comparable to that for the stellar field to drift through the planet .    across the foot of the flux tube on the stellar surface , the potential drop induces a current to flow across it .",
    "we show that the resistance on the surface of the star is larger than that in the planet .",
    "consequently , the intensity of the current is determined by the resistivity on the star .",
    "we quantitatively determine this resistivity , the associated current , ohmic dissipation rate , and torque due to the lorentz force .",
    "the ohmic dissipation in the star at the foot of the flux tube could also induce an observable hot - spot .",
    "the source of energy is the differential motion between the planet and the magnetosphere of its host star .",
    "the lorentz force on the planet and its host star leads to an evolution toward a state of synchronous rotation . inside the corotation radius , planets tend to lose angular momentum and migrate inward and the opposite trend occurs outside the corotation radius .",
    "consequently planets inside corotation migrate inward and those outside corotation migrate outward .    for super - earths with periods",
    "less than 3 days , the timescale for orbital evolution can be comparable or shorter than a few myr ( the timescale over which intense stellar magnetic field is maintained ) .",
    "the low abundance of super - earths with period less than 3 days may be due to their infant mortality .",
    "due to their finite conductivity , ohmic dissipation also occurs on within the super - earths .",
    "the heating rate depends on planet s poorly determined resistivity .",
    "its magnitude can be comparable to or larger than that the planet received from the stellar irradiation .",
    "the intense rate of ohmic dissipation may cause water and hydrogen molecule to dissociated and hydrogen atoms to segregate from other heavy elements .",
    "it is unclear whether a substantial fraction of the hydrogen atom may escape though hydrodynamic outflows . as the field decay with maturing stars , remaining excess oxygen atoms",
    "may either be incorporated in high density minerals or form oxygen molecules .",
    "either of these processes can lead to consequences which may be observable in the near future .",
    "there are several uncertainties which warrant further investigation .",
    "conductivity in super - earths and their host star need further study .",
    "we have not yet apply these results to a wide range of stellar and planetary models .",
    "the effect of feedback due to the adjustment of planet s and star s heated atmosphere also need to be examine .",
    "perhaps the largest uncertainty is whether the intense induced field can lead to magnetic reconnection and the breaking of the circuit .",
    "reconnection would increase the effective magnetic diffusivity and severely weakens the effective torque .    in order to directly compare with observations",
    ", we also need to consider a diverse range of planetary orbits .",
    "for example , this process may not work for planets with period longer than a few days .",
    "finally , it would be of interest to determine whether the intense electromagnetic interaction between super earths and their host stars can be directly observed in the radio - wave frequency range .",
    "nevertheless , we show that electrodynamic interaction is an important process for the orbital and structure evolution of super - earths as well as hot jupiters . along with many other physical processes it introduces diversity in the present - day configuration of extra solar planetary systems .",
