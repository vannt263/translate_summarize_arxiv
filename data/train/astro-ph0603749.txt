    "the ground based laser interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors viz .",
    "ligo@xcite , virgo@xcite , geo600@xcite tama 300@xcite produce a single data stream that may contain continuous , chirp , burst and stochastic gw . these detectors do nt point , but rather sweep their broad quadrupolar beam pattern across the sky as the earth moves . hence the data analysis system will have to carry out all sky searches for its sources . in this , the search of continuous gravitational wave ( cgw ) without a priori knowledge appears to be computationally quite demanding even by the standard computers expected to be available in the near future .",
    "it appears that due to limited computational resource it will be not feasible to do all sky all frequency search for the cgw in the months / year data set .",
    "hence for the search , one have to look for the signal in the short duration of data set .",
    "understanding the problem and the target sensitivity of the advance ligo , it may be feasible to do all sky search for one day data set at low and in narrow frequency band",
    ". the search may be more significant if it is done in the frequency band where most of the pulsars are detected by other means .",
    "also , the choice of optimal data processing and a clever programming is also integral part of a solution to this problem . amongst these the pre - correction of time series due to the doppler modulation before the data is processed may be a method , which will reduce the computational requirements . in reference to this",
    ", schutz@xcite has introduced the concept of patch in the sky as the region of space throughout which the required doppler correction remains the same .",
    "he shown that the number of patches required for @xmath1 sec .",
    "observation data set of one khz signal would be about @xmath2 .",
    "this also implies that the bank of search templates require for the match filtering in an all sky search .",
    "however , the size of the patch would also depend on the data analysis technique being employed , which in turn depend on the parameters contain in the phase of the modulated signal . hence , in this paper after incorporating the azimuth of the earth ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath0 in the fourier transform ( ft ) obtained by srivastava and sahay@xcite , we investigate its effect in the bank of search templates for one sidereal data set .",
    "hence in the next section we extend the ft of the frequency modulated ( fm ) cgw obtained by them@xcite with taking account of @xmath3 . in section 3",
    "we employ the concept of fitting factor ( ff)@xcite and check the cross correlation of the templates with the corresponding data set exceeds the preassigned threshold by considering the source location as parameters at different @xmath3 of the signal manifold and compute the number of search templates require for an all sky search applicable to such analysis .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 4 .    .",
    "the ft analysis of the frequency modulated cgw has been done by srivastava and sahay@xcite by taking account the effects arising due to the rotational as well as orbital motion of the earth .",
    "however , they have neglected an important parameter @xmath3 . to obtain ft by taking account of @xmath3 , we rewrite the phase of the received cgw signal of frequency @xmath4 at time @xmath5 with some modification given by them@xcite and may be written as    @xmath6    where + @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent respectively the celestial co - latitude , longitude , earth radius , average distance between earth centre from the origin of ssb frame , orbital and rotational angular velocity of the earth , co - latitude of the detector and obliquity of the ecliptic . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath16 are the azimuth of the earth and detector at @xmath0 respectively .",
    "+ now , the two polarisation functions of cgw can be described as @xmath17   \\label{eq : hpt}\\ ] ] @xmath18 \\label{eq : hct}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are constant amplitude of the two polarizations .",

    "the study of templates has been made by many research workers@xcite . however , the question of possible minimum efficient interpolated representation of the correlators for an all sky search is a problem of interest . in this , the study of the variation in the bank of search templates for the short duration of data set in reference to the parameter contain in the phase of modulated signal is very important .",

    ", we observe the obvious but major shift in the spectrum with @xmath3 .",
    "understanding the effect we check the variation in the bank of search templates at different @xmath3 .",
    "the bank of search templates are discrete set of signals from among the continuum of possible signals .",
    "consequently all the signals will not get detected with equal efficiency .",
    "however , it is possible to choose judiciously the set of templates so that all the signals of a given amplitude are detected with a given minimum detection loss .",
    "ff is one of the standard measure for deciding what class of wave form is good enough and quantitatively describes the closeness of the true signals to the template manifold in terms of the reduction of snr arising due to the cross correlation of a signal outside the manifold with the best matching templates lying inside the manifold , given as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent respectively the fts of the actual signal wave form and the templates .",
    "the inner product of two waveform @xmath44 and @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes complex conjugation , @xmath48 denotes the ft of the quantity underneath .",
    "@xmath49 is the spectral noise density of the detector and has been taken stationary and gaussian as the bandwidth of the signal is extremely narrow .    to compute the number of search templates we consider the ligo detector at hanford , receive a cgw signal of frequency @xmath50 hz from a source located at @xmath51 .",
    "we chosen the data set such that @xmath52 at @xmath0 . in this case",
    "we take the ranges of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath53 to @xmath54 and @xmath55 to @xmath56 respectively and bandwidth equal to @xmath57 hz for the integration .",
    "now , we select the spacing @xmath58 , thereafter we maximize over @xmath9 by introducing spacing @xmath59 in the so obtained bank of search templates and determine the resulting @xmath60 . in similar manner",

    "for example , one may adopt the method of hierarchical search .",
    "we have incorporated the parameter @xmath3 in the fm signal and investigated its effect in the bank of search templates for an all sky search .",
    "the analysis for complete response of the detector has not been done as the requisite is analogous to what presented by them@xcite and also not required for the templates analysis .",
    "we observe that the change of @xmath3 affects the spectra severely .",
    "consequently in the bank search templates . on investigation for one sidereal day data set of a signal of @xmath77 hz , we found that the number of search templates varies significantly with @xmath3 .",
