    "an unfolding procedure was applied , while in the second case a parameterization for the underground muon energy spectrum was assumed and a best fit of the spectral parameters was carried out .    to study how the energy spectra of underground muons are related to the primary cosmic ray spectrum and composition , a dedicated monte carlo simulation , described in sec .",

    "the surface muon spectral index is therefore related to the primary cosmic ray spectral index .",
    "the energy spectrum of underground muons can be derived taking into account the process of energy loss in the rock , which is assumed to have the form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a thin rock slab ( usually in @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the contribution from the ionization energy loss and @xmath39 is the contribution from radiative processes ( bremsstrahlung , pair production and muon hadroproduction ) . the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath40 are functions of the muon energy , but for practical purposes can be assumed as constants  @xcite .",

    "transition radiation ( tr ) is the process of the emission of x - ray photons occurring when an ultrarelativistic charged particle crosses the boundary between two materials with different dielectric constants .",
    "the most important features of tr are that the tr yield is roughly proportional to the lorentz factor @xmath50 of the radiating particle over a wide range of @xmath50 , and the emission probability of a tr x - ray is of the order of @xmath51 .",

    "a detailed description of the detector is given in  @xcite .",
    "the radiator material ( ethafoam 220 ) contains cells of @xmath62 wall thickness and @xmath63 spacing , ensuring a threshold lorentz factor @xmath64 and a saturation lorentz factor @xmath65 , that correspond to the muon energy range between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the proportional tubes were filled with an @xmath68 gas mixture and were operated at a gain of @xmath69 .",
    "they were equipped with a cluster counting read - out electronics .",

    "the third trd module was partially equipped with ten @xmath72 thick aluminum foils of @xmath73 area , that were inserted between each radiator and the tube plane below , in the terminal part of the module .",
    "the aluminum foils absorbed the tr emitted by muons in the upstream radiator layers . using this technique a sample of muons",

    "we associated to each muon all the proportional tubes hits within @xmath77 from the track . to avoid badly reconstructed tracks ,",
    "only muons crossing at least three layers of streamer tubes in the lower part of macro were used .",
    "muons accompanied with electromagnetic showers initiated in the rock surrounding the detector were also discarded . since the trd was calibrated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : trdcalib ] ) with particles crossing all the ten layers of proportional tubes at angles below @xmath78 , in the present analysis only muons crossing the whole detector with zenith angle smaller than @xmath78 were included .",
    "runs in which the trd modules were affected by stability problems or malfunctioning were discarded . also runs with reconstructed muon rates differing more than three standard deviations from the average values were disregarded , as well as those runs whose duration was less than @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig : hitdist ] shows the distributions of the number of hits produced in the trd proportional tubes along the muon tracks for the final data samples .",
    "since the second and third trd modules were equipped with a different read - out electronics from that of the first module , two different response functions ( described in the next section ) were necessary to analyze the data samples from the first module and those from the second and third modules .",
    "the results of the two analysis were then combined .",
    "we define @xmath83 as the distributions of the trd hits for a sample of muons with zenith angle @xmath84 that crossed a rock thickness @xmath11 .",
    "the rock thickness @xmath11 was calculated from the direction @xmath85 using the gran sasso map  @xcite and was converted into standard rock according the prescriptions of  @xcite .",
    "these distributions can be related to the residual muon energy spectra @xmath86 by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the tr detector response function , i.e. the probability to observe @xmath89 hits along the track of a muon with underground energy @xmath90 , crossing the detector at a zenith angle @xmath84 .    to reconstruct the muon energy spectrum @xmath86 starting from the measured hit distributions ( fig .",

    "we simulated , with a full geant - based  @xcite monte carlo , a muon sample distributed according a flat energy and solid angle spectrum ( i.e. @xmath91 ) .",
    "on the basis of the calibration data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trdcalib ] , seven energy bins and four angular bins were defined .",
    "the first energy bin covers the range from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , and the last one covers the range above the trd saturation ( @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 ) .    the number of hits produced in the trd by a simulated muon of energy @xmath97 crossing the detector at zenith angle @xmath84 was extracted by the corresponding calibration data set . the trd response function ( a @xmath98 matrix )",
    "was calculated as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the number of simulated muons with residual energy @xmath97 and zenith angle @xmath84 , producing @xmath89 hits , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the total number of simulated muons with energy @xmath97 crossing the trd at a zenith angle @xmath84 .",
    "the simulated data had the same format of experimental data and were processed by the same analysis tools used for real data .",
    "the accuracy and the time stability of the trd response function also needed to be taken into account .",
    "although the nominal gas gain of the trd proportional tubes was the same of the tubes used in the prototype , during the long time - scale data acquisition period their operating conditions were affected by fluctuations .",
    "this was due to drifts of some important parameters , like the gas mixture composition , the atmospheric pressure and the temperature .",
    "a first check of the trd response function for energies below the threshold for the emission of tr was made using stopping muons , i.e. muons that are absorbed in the lower part of macro , that can be easily tagged by imposing simple geometrical cuts .",
    "since the average residual energy of these muons is below a few @xmath103 , we simulated a sample of muons with a flat energy spectrum up to @xmath104 .",
    "the same algorithm for the selection of stopping muons was applied to both the real and the simulated data samples .",
    "the measured hit distributions of stopping muons are well reproduced by the monte carlo simulation ( see table  [ tab : mustop ] ) , thus confirming the reliability of the trd calibration in the low energy region .",
    "a further check of the detector response function was performed using the data from the part of the third module equipped with aluminum foils .",
    "since the aluminum foils absorbed the tr produced in the upstream radiator , this data sample allows to check the detector response for muons releasing energy in the proportional tubes only by ionization . to take into account the weak dependence of the trd response on ionization ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : trdal ] the values of the average number of hits along the muon track versus the muon zenith angle from the monte carlo and from the real data are shown .",
    "the @xmath105 value ( evaluated using only statistical errors ) is @xmath106 , showing that there is a good agreement between the data and the simulation .    from this analysis we estimated the systematic uncertainty arising from the fluctuations of the detector operating conditions .",
    "for each of the four angular bins used for evaluating the trd response function , we compared the measured hit distributions @xmath107 with the simulated ones .",
    "we remarked that the differences between the experimental average values and the monte carlo predictions are within @xmath108 .",
    "for this reason , to take into account the fluctuations of the detector operating conditions , we associated to the average values of each hit distribution of the calibration data set , an uncertainty of @xmath108 .",
    "these uncertainties will propagate to the systematic errors affecting the measurement of the residual energy of muons .",
    "the systematic errors quoted in the present analysis ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : spectra ] ) are greater than the ones quoted in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "when that analysis was performed , the trd module equipped with aluminum foils was still not taking data . for this reason , we could estimate the systematic uncertainties only on the basis of the beam test data and we decided to associate to the calibration data set an uncertainty of @xmath109 , that is lower than the value we adopted for this analysis .",
    "as shown in section  [ sec : trdresp ] , the residual energy spectra of underground muons are related to the measured hit distributions in the trd by eq .",
    "[ eq : hit ] .",
    "two different methods were applied to reconstruct the underground muon energy spectra by inversion of eq .",
    "[ eq : hit ] .",
    "the first approach uses the same unfolding procedure described in  @xcite . in the second approach a parameterization for the muon energy spectrum",
    "was assumed and the parameters were derived using a best fit procedure .      unfolding techniques are widely applied in problems where matrix inversion is required  @xcite . to reconstruct the energy spectra of single and double muons starting from the hit distributions of fig .",

[ eq : musurf ] ) is assumed for the surface energy spectrum and the dependence of @xmath134 and @xmath40 on the muon energy is taken into account , it is impossible to obtain an analytical expression for the underground muon spectrum .",

    "the following conclusions can be drawn :    * single muons are originated mainly by primary protons ; * the contributions of primary heavy elements become relevant when the muon multiplicities increase , while the contribution of protons decreases ; * in the `` heavy '' composition model the contribution of @xmath163 nuclei is relevant from low multiplicities ( it is @xmath175 for @xmath176 and tends to @xmath177 for high multiplicities ) ; * in the light model , the main contribution is always that of protons ; * for a fixed muon multiplicity , muons originated by light primaries are more energetic than muons originated by heavy primaries .    from the simulation we get that the average energies of underground muons produced by each component are almost independent on the primary composition model .",
    "this is due to the fact that the differences between the spectral indices of the primary components in the models we are examining are small for energies below the `` knee '' , as can be seen from table [ tab : models ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the muons produced e.g. by he nuclei have the same average energy , independently on the choice of the composition model .",

    "single muon data are not in contradiction with the predictions from both the composition models . in fact , since the energy gaps between the predictions from the two extreme composition models are of the same order of magnitude as the error bars , single muons do not allow one to discriminate between different cosmic ray composition models . the sensitivity of this measurement to the primary cosmic ray composition",

    "the average energies of single and double muons , evaluated with the unfolding technique described in sec .  [ sec : unfo ] , are @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the spectral indices for the approximate parameterization of the muon energy spectra ( eq .  [ eq : undspec ] ) , evaluated with the best fit procedure described in sec .",
    "[ sec : fit ] are @xmath150 and @xmath152 .",
    "we also performed a monte carlo simulation to study how the muon energy spectra depend on the primary cosmic ray energy spectra and composition , on their interactions with the atmosphere and on the muon propagation in the rock .",
    "our data show that double muons are more energetic than single ones in the standard rock depth range from @xmath2 to @xmath182 , as predicted by our monte carlo simulation .",
    "the monte carlo simulation also showed that a measurement of the energies of underground high multiplicity muons could provide useful information about the primary cosmic ray composition .",
    "in fact , we remarked that the differences between the predictions from the various composition models become relevant at high muon multiplicities , where the contribution from heavy primaries is more significant .",
    "the energy spectra of single and double muons reconstructed from our data are in agreement with the monte carlo predictions obtained assuming two extreme cosmic ray composition models .",
    "this measurement do not allow to perform a cosmic ray composition study because the errors are compatible with the gaps between the predictions from the two models .",
    "however , a measurement of the energy spectra of high multiplicity underground muons could provide a useful tool for investigating the primary cosmic ray composition in the energy region above the knee of the spectrum ."
