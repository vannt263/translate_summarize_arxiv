    "the game of cops and robbers ( defined , along with all the standard notation , at the end of this section ) is usually studied in the context of the _ cop number _ , the minimum number of cops needed to ensure a winning strategy .",
    "the cop number is often challenging to analyze ; establishing upper bounds for this parameter is the focus of meyniel s conjecture that the cop number of a connected @xmath3-vertex graph is @xmath4 for additional background on cops and robbers and meyniel s conjecture , see the book  @xcite and the surveys  @xcite .",
    "a number of variants of cops and robbers have been studied .",
    "for example , we may allow a cop to capture the robber from a distance @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is a non - negative integer  @xcite , play on edges  @xcite , allow one or both players to move with different speeds  @xcite or to teleport , allow the robber to capture the cops  @xcite , or make the robber invisible or drunk  @xcite .",
    "see chapter  8 of  @xcite for a non - comprehensive survey of variants of cops and robbers .",
    "we are interested in slowing the cops down to create a situation akin to chess , where at most one chess piece can move in a round .",
    "hence , our focus in the present article is a recent variant introduced by offner and ojakian  @xcite , where at most one cop can move in any given round .",
    "we refer to this variant , whose formal definition appears in section [ sec : defns ] , as _ lazy cops and robbers _ ; the analogue of the cop number is called the _ lazy cop number _ , and is written @xmath6 for a graph @xmath7 in  @xcite it was proved for the hypercube @xmath8 that @xmath9 .",
    "we mention in passing that @xcite introduced a number of variants of cops and robbers , in which some fixed number of cops ( perhaps more than one ) can move in a given round .",
    "we focus here on the extreme case in which only one cop moves in each round , but it seems likely that our techniques generalize to other variants .    we present three results on lazy cops and robbers and the lazy cop number . in theorem",
    "[ thm : main_gnp ] we provide asymptotically almost sure bounds on the lazy cop number for binomial random graphs @xmath0 for a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "we do this by examining typical expansion properties of such graphs . in theorem  [ thm : hyp - lower ] , by using the probabilistic method coupled with a potential function argument , we improve on the lower bound for the lazy cop number of hypercubes given in @xcite . in theorem",
    "[ thm : bded_genus ] , we provide an upper bound for graphs of genus @xmath2 using the gilbert - hutchinson - tarjan separator theorem  @xcite .",
    "we consider only finite , undirected graphs in this paper .",
    "for background on graph theory , the reader is directed to  @xcite .",
    "the game of _ cops and robbers _ was independently introduced in  @xcite and the cop number was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the game is played on a reflexive graph ; that is , each vertex has at least one loop .",
    "multiple edges are allowed , but make no difference to the play of the game , so we always assume there is exactly one edge joining adjacent vertices .",
    "there are two players , consisting of a set of _ cops _ and a single _",
    "robber_. the game is played over a sequence of discrete time - steps or _ turns _",
    ", with the cops going first on turn @xmath10 and then playing on alternate time - steps .",
    "a _ round _ of the game is a cop move together with the subsequent robber move .",
    "the cops and robber occupy vertices ; for simplicity , we often identify the player with the vertex they occupy .",
    "we refer to the set of cops as @xmath11 and the robber as @xmath12 when a player is ready to move in a round they must move to a neighbouring vertex . because of the loops , players can _ pass _ , or remain on their own vertices . observe that any subset of @xmath11 may move in a given round .",
    "the cops win if after some finite number of rounds , one of them can occupy the same vertex as the robber ( in a reflexive graph , this is equivalent to the cop landing on the robber ) .",
    "this is called a _",
    "capture_. the robber wins if he can evade capture indefinitely .",
    "a _ winning strategy for the cops _ is a set of rules that if followed , result in a win for the cops .",
    "a _ winning strategy for the robber _ is defined analogously . as stated earlier",
    ", the game of _ lazy cops and robbers _ is defined almost exactly as cops and robbers , with the exception that exactly one cop moves in any round .",
    "if we place a cop at each vertex , then the cops are guaranteed to win .",
    "therefore , the minimum number of cops required to win in a graph @xmath13 is a well - defined positive integer , named the _ lazy cop number _ of the graph @xmath7 we write @xmath6 for the lazy cop number of a graph @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we consider the game played on binomial random graphs .",
    "the _ random graph _ @xmath0 consists of the probability space @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the set of all graphs with vertex set @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the family of all subsets of @xmath15 , and for every @xmath18 , @xmath19 this space may be viewed as the set of outcomes of @xmath20 independent coin flips , one for each pair @xmath21 of vertices , where the probability of success ( that is , adding edge @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 note that @xmath1 may tend to zero as @xmath3 tends to infinity .",
    "all asymptotics throughout are as @xmath24 ( we emphasize that the notations @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to functions of @xmath3 , not necessarily positive , whose growth is bounded ) .",
    "we say that an event in a probability space holds _ asymptotically almost surely _ ( or _ a.a.s .",
    "_ ) if the probability that it holds tends to @xmath27 as @xmath3 goes to infinity .",
    "let us first briefly describe some known results on the ( non - lazy ) cop number of @xmath0 .",
    "bonato , wang , and praat investigated such games in @xmath0 random graphs and in generalizations used to model complex networks with power - law degree distributions ( see  @xcite ) . from their results",
    "it follows that if @xmath28 for some @xmath29 , then a.a.s .",

    "in fact , for @xmath32 we have that a.a.s .",
    "a simple argument using dominating sets shows that meyniel s conjecture also holds a.a.s .   if @xmath31 tends to 1 as @xmath3 goes to infinity ( see  @xcite for this and stronger results ) .",
    "bollobs , kun and leader  @xcite showed that if @xmath34 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath35 from these results , if @xmath36 and either @xmath37 or @xmath38 , then a.a.s .",
    "@xmath39 . somewhat surprisingly , between these values it was shown by uczak and praat  @xcite that the cop number has more complicated behaviour",
    "it follows that a.a.s .",
    "@xmath40 is asymptotic to the function ( denoted in blue ) shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the above results show that meyniel s conjecture holds a.a.s .  for random graphs except perhaps when @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , or when @xmath37 .",
    "praat and wormald showed recently that the conjecture holds a.a.s .",

    "we adjust the definition of being `` safe '' as follows : @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath255 for every @xmath208 , and @xmath256 .",
    "this assures that @xmath230 is bounded as needed , that is , @xmath257 finally , the number of @xmath253-dangerous neighbours of @xmath75 can be given by @xmath258 so @xmath259 , provided that @xmath249 is adjusted to be @xmath260 .",
    "in @xcite , offner and ojakian provided asymptotic lower and upper bounds on @xmath261 . more precisely , they showed that @xmath262 and @xmath263 . in this section ,",
    "we asymptotically improve the lower bound .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : hyp - lower ] for all @xmath264 , we have that @xmath265    thus , the upper and lower bounds on @xmath261 differ by only a polynomial factor .",
    "we present a winning strategy for the robber provided that the number of cops is not too large .",
    "let @xmath264 be fixed , and suppose there are @xmath266 cops ( where @xmath5 will be chosen later ) .",
    "we introduce a potential function that depends on each cop s distance to the robber .",

    "we let @xmath270 where , for @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 note that this potential function ignores all cops at distance more than @xmath274 .",
    "we say that a cop at distance @xmath74 from the robber has _ weight _",
    "@xmath275 ; this represents that cop s individual contribution toward the potential . in particular , we have that @xmath276 and @xmath277 . if the cops can capture the robber on their turn , then immediately before the cops turn we must have @xmath278 , since some cop must be at distance 1 from the robber .",
    "suppose that before the cops make their move , the potential function satisfies @xmath279 note that there can not be a cop adjacent to the robber .",
    "initially , we may assume that all cops start at the same vertex ; the robber places himself at any vertex at distance at least @xmath274 from the cops .",
    "initially , @xmath280 , so ( [ pinv ] ) holds . our goal is to show that the robber can always enforce ( [ pinv ] ) right before the cops move , from which it would follow that the robber can evade the cops indefinitely .",
    "* case 1*. suppose that on the cops turn , a cop moves to some vertex adjacent to the robber , creating a `` deadly '' neighbour for the robber .",
    "the robber s strategy is to move away from this `` deadly '' vertex , but to do so in a way that maintains the invariant  ( [ pinv ] ) . to show that this is possible",
    ", we compute the expected change in the potential function if the robber were to choose his next position at random from among all neighbours other than the deadly one .",
    "consider a cop , @xmath11 , at distance @xmath74 from the robber , where @xmath281 . before the robber s move",

    "let @xmath282 represent the expected weight of @xmath11 after the robber s move .",
    "if @xmath11 s vertex and the deadly vertex differ on the deadly coordinate , then @xmath283 , whereas if these coordinates coincide , then @xmath284 .",
    "since @xmath285 , we may upper bound @xmath282 as follows : @xmath286 hence , after the robber s move , the expected sum of the weights of such cops has decreased by a multiplicative factor of at least @xmath287 , making it at most @xmath288 in addition , the cop that moved to the neighbourhood of the robber would again be at distance 2 , making her weight @xmath289 it might also be that after the robber s move , some cops that were previously at distance @xmath290 from the robber are now at distance @xmath269 . by limiting the total number of cops , we may show that the total weight of cops at distance @xmath274 is always negligible ; that is , always less than , say , @xmath291 .",
    "the weight of a single cop at this distance is @xmath292 we bound the product term in  ( [ eq:12 ] ) by @xmath293 to bound the binomial term , we note that @xmath294 and approximate : @xmath295 now take @xmath296 to be minimal such that @xmath297 and @xmath274 is an integer",
    ". then we have that @xmath298 so if we bound the total number of cops by @xmath299 , then we have that the total weight of cops at distance @xmath300 is at most @xmath301 thus , after the robber s random move , combining estimates , and , we can upper bound the total expected weight by @xmath302 hence some deterministic move produces a potential at least as low as the expectation , so the robber may maintain the invariant , as desired .    * case 2*. suppose now that a cop moves to a vertex at distance @xmath303 from the robber . the resulting increase in the potential function is at most @xmath304 , so the new potential function has value at most @xmath305 .",
    "now , by the calculations from case 1 , the robber can move so that the total weight of all cops at distances @xmath306 through @xmath274 decreases by a multiplicative factor of @xmath307 . hence , after the robber s move , the potential is at most @xmath308 where we have once again taken into account the possibility of new cops at distance @xmath274 .",
