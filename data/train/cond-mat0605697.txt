    "the discovery of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) by iijima @xcite and their subsequent large - scale production @xcite was followed by the synthesis of cnts filled with atoms and/or molecules .",
    "these novel hybrid materials often exhibit one - dimensional characteristics and are presently the subject of fundamental studies as well as research aiming at their application in nanotechnology . for a review on cnts and",
    "their filling we refer to refs .   and , respectively .",
    "self - assembled chains of c@xmath0 fullerene molecules inside single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) , the so - called peapods @xcite , provide a unique example of such nanoscopic compound materials , and feature unusual electronic @xcite and structural properties .",
    "high - resolution transmission electron microscopy observations on cnts filled sparsely with c@xmath0 molecules @xcite demonstrate the motion of the fullerene molecules along the tube axis and imply that the interaction between c@xmath0 molecules and the surrounding nanotube wall is due to weak van der waals forces and not to chemical bonds .",
    "recently , the way the c@xmath0 molecules of a ( c@xmath0)@xmath1@swcnt peapod @xcite  @xmath2 c@xmath0 molecules inside in a swcnt  are packed in the encapsulating tube has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "obviously , the structure of a peapod is governed by the interactions between the c@xmath0 molecules , and by the way a c@xmath0 molecule interacts with the surrounding tube wall .",
    "already when considering the stacking of cylindrically confined hard spheres , a possible rudimentary description of a ( c@xmath0)@xmath1@swcnt peapod , various chiral structures of the spheres stacking for varying tube radius are obtained @xcite . in ref .",
    ", hodak and girifalco calculated lowest - energy ( c@xmath0)@xmath1@swcnt peapod configurations by means of a continuum approach for the c@xmath0-tube interaction : both a swcnt and a c@xmath0 molecule are approximated as a homogeneous surface  cylindrical and spherical , respectively .",
    "although in doing so any effect of tube chirality and/or molecular orientation can not be accounted for , such a model provides useful information about the spatial arrangement of the spherical molecules in the tube .",
    "ten different stacking arrangements were obtained for the tube radius @xmath3 ranging from @xmath4  to @xmath5  .",
    "the simplest configuration ( c@xmath0  spheres \" aligned linearly along the tube axis ) occurs for the smallest tubes ( @xmath4  @xmath6  ) .",
    "other phases consist of zig - zag patterns or c@xmath0 balls forming helices .",
    "some of the predicted phases have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "interestingly , experimental observations of similar structures formed by c@xmath0 molecules inside bn nanotubes have been reported as well @xcite .",
    "an atomistic molecular dynamics study on the arranging of c@xmath0 molecules inside swcnts was carried out by troche et al .",
    "@xcite ; the c@xmath0-tube interaction was modelled by adding carbon - carbon lennard - jones 6 - 12 potentials .",
    "troche et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the chirality of the encapsulating swcnt has only a minor effect on the lowest - energy configuration of the c@xmath0 molecules and their obtained arrangements , thus depending on the tube radius only , are in full agreement with those of hodak and girifalco @xcite .",
    "conclusions on the individual orientations of c@xmath0 molecules inside a swcnt were not given by troche et al .",
    "@xcite  their goal was to study the packing of several molecules .",
    "molecular orientation effects are expected to come into play at sufficiently low temperatures when orientational motion is frozen , and indeed do so as was shown in refs .   and , where the potential energy of a single c@xmath0 molecule confined to the tube axis of a swcnt , called  nanotube field \" , was calculated by treating the tube as a homogeneous cylindrical carbonic surface density but retaining the icosahedral features of a c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "a specific dependence on the tube radius was found ; three distinct molecular orientations were observed within the range @xmath7  .",
    "it is our opinion that , for calculating tube - c@xmath0 interactions , taking the detailed molecular structure of a c@xmath0 molecule into account has priority over the chiral structure of a nanotube .",
    "replacing a swcnt by a continuous cylindrical distribution of carbon atoms is intuitively justifiable , but treating a c@xmath0 molecule as a sphere ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with no further structure is a more questionable approximation . indeed , whereas the carbon - carbon bonds in a cnt are of one type , a c@xmath0 molecule features longer (  single \" ) and shorter (  double \" ) bonds , arranged in pentagons  electron - poor regions  and hexagons  electron - rich regions .",
    "the importance of taking the detailed molecular structure properly into account follows from refs . and",
    "; but the neglect of the discrete atomistic structure of the tube when considering c@xmath0-tube interactions , although intuitively plausible , requires solid grounds .",
    "the goal of this paper is to answer the question how good a smooth - tube approximation really is , and to confirm the relevance of the precise structure of a c@xmath0 molecule , i.e.  the importance of allowing for molecular orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nanotubefield ] , we discuss formulas for the calculation of the nanotube field of an encapsulated c@xmath0 molecule for both a  continuous \" and a  discrete \" tube",
    ". then ( sec .",
    "[ comparison ] ) , we plot nanotube fields for a selection of representative nanotubes and make preliminary visual comparisons between the two approaches . in sec .",
    "[ casestudy ] , we present an all - variable treatment and apply it for tubes with intermediate and small tube radii . finally , general conclusions are given ( sec .",
    "[ discussion ] ) .",
    "we consider a c@xmath0 molecule in a swcnt , the molecule assuming a centered position in the tube , and set up a cartesian system of axes @xmath8 so that the @xmath9-axis coincides with the tube s long axis and contains the molecule s center of mass ( fig .  [ figswcnt ] ) .",
    "the potential energy @xmath10 of the c@xmath0 molecule then depends on the orientation of the molecule , which can be characterized by three euler angles @xmath11 , on the position of the molecule along the tube , i.e.  the @xmath9-coordinate of the molecular center of mass for which we write @xmath12 , and on the tube indices @xcite @xmath13 : @xmath14 for the euler angles we use the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite : a coordinate function @xmath15 is transformed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for the succession of a rotation over @xmath18 about the @xmath9-axis , a rotation over @xmath19 about the @xmath20-axis , and a rotation over @xmath21 about the @xmath9-axis again .",
    "the @xmath22- , @xmath20- and @xmath9-axes are kept fixed .",
    "note that the * coordinate * transform associated with the euler angles reads @xmath23 and that the rotation of the c@xmath0 molecule over @xmath24 about the @xmath9-axis is performed last . as the starting orientation [ @xmath25 we take the so - called standard orientation [ fig .  [ orientations](a ) ] : twofold molecular symmetry axes then coincide with the cartesian axes and every cartesian axis intersects two opposing double bonds .",
    "( we recall that the carbon - carbon bonds of a c@xmath0 molecule can be divided into two categories : 60 single bonds , fusing pentagons and hexagons , and 30 double bonds , fusing hexagons .",
    "the latter are somewhat longer than the former @xcite . ) bearing in mind the results of refs .   and and",
    "anticipating the results obtained in the present work , we point out two more molecular orientations of importance .",
    "the first is the  pentagonal \" orientation class , obtained by the euler transformation @xmath26 , resulting in two opposing pentagons of the c@xmath0 molecule being perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis [ fig.[orientations](b ) ] .",
    "the second is the category of  hexagonal \" orientations , a result of the euler transformation @xmath27 , making two opposing hexagons lie perpendicular to the @xmath9-axis [ fig .",
    "[ orientations](c ) ] .",
    "the angle @xmath28 is related to the dihedral angle @xmath29 ( the inner angle between adjacent faces ) of a regular icosahedron : @xmath30 . other @xmath31 pairs yield  pentagonal \" ,  hexagonal \" and ",
    "double - bond \" orientations as well : 12 pairs correspond to a  pentagonal \" , 20 pairs to a  hexagonal \" , and 30 pairs to a  double - bond \" orientation since a c@xmath0 molecule has 12 pentagons , 20 hexagons and 30 double bonds .    for the description of the interaction between the c@xmath0 molecule and the nanotube we follow earlier work @xcite and treat the c@xmath0 molecule as a rigid cluster of interaction centers ( ics ) . not only c atoms ( ` a ' )",
    "act as ics , but also double bonds ( ` db ' ) and single bonds ( ` sb ' ) .",
    "we label the 60 atoms by the index @xmath32 . in the center of every of the 60 single bonds",
    "an ic is put , labelled by the index @xmath33 . on each of the 30 double bonds ,",
    "3 ics dividing the bond in four equal parts are put , totalling to 90 db ics , labelled @xmath34 .",
    "such a construction was originally introduced for modelling intermolecular interactions in solid c@xmath0 ( c@xmath0 fullerite ) ; having three ics per double bond reflects the electronic density being smeared out along a double bond @xcite .",
    "every ic of the c@xmath0 molecule interacts with every atom of the nanotube via a pair interaction potential @xmath35 , depending on the type of ic ( ` t ' = ` a ' , ` db ' , ` sb ' ) .",
    "the total potential energy is then obtained by summing over all pair interactions :      where @xmath37 indexes the atoms of the tube and @xmath38 stands for their respective coordinates . as in refs .   and ,",
    "we use born  mayer  van der waals pair interaction potentials : @xmath39 again , the use of such pair potentials was originally introduced for studying c@xmath0 - c@xmath0 interactions in c@xmath0 fullerite @xcite ; it lead to a crystal field potential and a structural phase transition temperature @xcite in good agreement with experiments .",
    "the potential constants @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 used are those of ref .  . in eq.([discreteeq",
    "] ) , the sum over tube atoms , labelled by the index @xmath37 and having coordinates @xmath43 , can be restricted to atoms in a certain vicinity of the c@xmath0 molecule , realized by imposing the criterion @xmath44      in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , a smooth - tube approximation to eq .",
    "( [ discreteeq ] ) was presented .",
    "the actual network of carbon atoms making up the swcnt is replaced by a homogeneous , cylindrical  carbonic \" surface density with value @xmath47 ( units @xmath48 ) .",
    "the c@xmath0 molecule - nanotube interaction energy is then rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cylindrical coordinate of a point on the tube ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) and @xmath3 is the tube radius .",
    "the motivation for introducing approximation ( [ smootheq ] ) is twofold .",
    "one reason is the dependence of @xmath54 on the tube radius @xmath3 rather than on the tube indices @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , @xmath3 remains the only relevant tube - characteristic parameter and as such simplifies a systematic investigation of carbon nanotubes .",
    "a further consequence of the tube s cylindrical symmetry is the irrelevance of the euler angle @xmath55 ( a final rotation of the c@xmath0 molecule over @xmath24 about the tube axis does nt matter ) and of the @xmath9-coordinate @xmath12 ( for infinite or long - enough tubes ) .",
    "a second advantage of the smooth - tube ansatz is the possibility of performing an expansion of @xmath54 into symmetry - adapted rotator functions , a point we will return to in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "we stress the limited dependence of @xmath54 by writing @xmath56 to distinguish the smooth - tube approximation from the discrete case , we add the subscript ` discrete ' : @xmath57 where the actual expression is given by eqs .",
    "( [ discreteeq ] )  ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "in this paper we test the validity of smooth - tube approximation ( [ smootheq ] ) by comparing @xmath58 and @xmath54 for a selection of tubes .",
    "bearing in mind the three qualitatively different radii ranges ( @xmath59  , @xmath60  @xmath61  and @xmath62  @xmath63 ) obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have selected zig - zag , armchair and chiral tubes with radii around @xmath64  , @xmath65  and @xmath66  .",
    "we have generated @xmath13 tubes starting from a graphene sheet with basis vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are planar cartesian basis vectors , and performing the roll - up along the vector @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the tube is then positioned so that the c atom originally ( before rolling up ) at @xmath72 lies in the @xmath73 plane with @xmath22-coordinate @xmath74 and @xmath20-coordinate @xmath3 and that the cylinder containing the c atoms has its long axis coinciding with the @xmath9-axis . the c@xmath0 molecule is initially positioned so that its center of mass lies at the origin ( @xmath75 ) ; a translation along the @xmath9-axis away from the initial position is measured via the center of mass @xmath9-coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "the radius of the tube with indices @xmath13 reads @xmath76 , with @xmath77  @xcite ; the corresponding surface density has the value @xmath78 a further tube parameter is its translational periodicity @xmath79 , relevant when considering the @xmath12-dependence of v@xmath80 . while @xmath79 is small for non - chiral  i.e.  zig - zag , @xmath81 , and armchair , @xmath82  tubes , the translational period can get very large for chiral tubes @xcite .",
    "a tube may also have an @xmath83-fold symmetry axis ( coinciding with the @xmath9-axis ) and therefore a rotational period @xmath84 .",
