    "r - parity is a discrete symmetry defined by assigning to every field the number @xmath1 ( @xmath2 - baryon ( lepton ) number , @xmath3 - spin of the particle ) @xcite .",
    "if it is conserved then baryon and lepton number violating transitions are forbidden . in that case , the theory guarantees both proton stability and lepton universality .",
    "however , in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , gauge invariance and renormalizability , the two main principles of any gauge theory , do not assure r - parity conservation . at present , wide phenomenological investigations of r - parity violating processes have been undertaken ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .    here",
    "we will explore the possibility of discovering the lepton number violating process of single chargino production at future lepton - lepton colliders ( see fig.1(i ) for an electron - electron collision ) .",
    "to our knowledge this process has not yet been discussed , though lepton number violating charginos pair production in electron - electron collisions ( fig.1(ii ) ) has been considered @xcite .",
    "let us start with electron - electron collisions .",
    "the analysis of the muon option is analogous and will be shortly discussed whenever needed . as can be seen from fig.1(i )",
    ", the cross section for single chargino production is proportional to @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are couplings involved in the following lagrangians ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 are family indices ) : @xmath9 these lagrangians are written in physical basis .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ lag_g ] ) comes from the sneutrino mass matrix diagonalization .",
    "if r - parity is violated , we have to take into account the mixing between the sneutrinos @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the neutral higgs bosons @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we shall , however , assume that this mixing is negligible and does not affect the results , at least at the stage of chargino production . in what follows",
    "we shall also assume that the exchange of the lightest ( electron ) sneutrino dominates ( which is equivalent to some hierarchy assumption in the sneutrino sector ) and neglect the contribution of the heavier @xmath16 s .",
    "we therefore set ( @xmath17 stands for electron ) @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ lag_g ] ) . for more complicated cases where the interplay between sneutrino masses in propagators and appropriate elements of the @xmath19 matrix matters we refer to @xcite .",
    "the second mixing matrix , namely @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ lag_g ] ) is connected with the chargino sector and describes the weights of the wino component of the chargino fields @xcite .",
    "since this is the only component of the charginos that couples to the electron and the sneutrino ( the charged higgsino coupling is neglected in the limit of zero electron mass ) we set for simplicity @xmath21 . this is further justified by the analysis @xcite ( in the parameter region @xmath22 gev , @xmath23 gev for both small and large @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the higgsino and gaugino @xmath26 mass parameters , respectively , and @xmath27 a ratio of two vacuum expectation values involved in mssm ) . in general",
    "the results should be multiplied by @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , with r - parity violation , additional couplings between leptons , gauginos and higgsinos @xmath29 exist , but are known to be smaller than the gauge ones @xcite .",
    "2 we gather the cross sections for single chargino production at future electron - electron colliders with c.m . energies @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 tev as functions of the chargino mass for different sneutrino masses electron beam polarization . in reality",
    "we can expect that @xmath32 can be achieved",
    ". then the cross sections must be multiplied by a factor @xmath33 . ] . for the r - parity violating coupling , we have used the most conservative available upper limit @xmath34 @xcite , independently of the @xmath11 mass ( in the case of muon - muon collisions the @xmath35 couplings",
    "would be involved ) . for sneutrino masses larger than 100 gev",
    "this limit becomes weaker @xcite .",
    "as can be deduced from fig.2 , with a planned annual luminosity of some 50 fb@xmath36 yr@xmath36 @xcite and with a discovery limit at a level of 10 events per year ( @xmath37 fb ) , the process is detectable for a wide range of sparticle masses .    with the r - parity violating production process ( i ) we are already definitely out of the sm physics .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the possible detector signals . with r - parity non - conservation ,",
    "the collider phenomenology is quite different from the mssm case and depends especially on the nature of the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) . in the mssm",
    ", the stable lsp must be charge and color neutral for cosmological reasons @xcite . with r - parity violation",
    "there are no hints about the unstable lsp",
    ". it can be among others a sneutrino , gluino or even a chargino @xcite .    here",
    "we give an example of nonstandard phenomenology but restrict ourselves to a scenario in which charginos decay uniquely ( via sneutrino exchange ) to charged leptons .",
    "final leptonic signals with lepton number violation and without missing energy could be detected , an interesting situation from the point of view of nonstandard physics , as there is no sm background ( see further discussion ) .",
    "these two conditions ( charged leptons without missing energy in the final state ) require the chargino to be the second lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) with sneutrino the lsp .",
    "this situation is schematically summarized in fig.3 .",
    "if the chargino were the lsp its lifetime should be long enough so that it would be seen in the detector .",
    "in other cases ( i.e. when the chargino is neither nlsp nor lsp ) the chargino would also have cascade decays to final jet states @xcite .",
    "then , the situation would be more complicated but at least we can expect that for kinematical reasons a decay to the r - parity lepton violating lsp sneutrino would still be important and the final signal with four charged leptons could be observed ( work in progress ) .",
    "let us discuss the scenario with nlsp chargino .",
    "first , we should notice that , to get substantial chargino production ( e.g. @xmath38 in fig.2 ) , we are interested in the situation where at least one , let us say @xmath39 coupling is large",
    ". then the decay of chargino to three charged leptons must be observed in the detector , as it can undergo uniquely through the same large @xmath39 coupling ( the only possible decay channel , see fig.3 ) .    in fig.4 , we show the final results for the angular distribution of the final positron ( fig.3 ) for two different energies ( @xmath40 gev ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 gev .",
    "results have been obtained using the vegas procedure .",
    "four particles in the final state give us an 8 dimensional integration .",
    "we have also applied the narrow width approximation where @xmath43 ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the solid line describes results based on eq .",
    "( a.21 ) , when interferences between production and decay of charginos with @xmath44 are taken into account .",
    "the dashed line describes results with factorization assumed @xcite , which means the following replacement in eq .",
    "( a.21 ) is done @xmath45 we can see that spin correlations do not change the results substantially ( @xmath46 % for considered c.m energies and the chargino mass ) .",
    "it is important that the positron angular distributions are not so strongly peaked in the beam directions , even for @xmath31 tev collider energy . with assumed cuts",
    "@xmath47 enough events will be detected to investigate the process .    the only sm process , which gives a four charged lepton signal without missing energy is @xcite @xmath48 . with a possible z boson decay to the lepton - antilepton pair",
    ", it does not coincide with the process under investigation ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "that means that we do not have to bother about the sm background contamination .",
    "however , this cross section is large enough ( @xmath50 pb for @xmath51 tev energies ) to cover some other scenarios .",
    "as an example let us assume that not only @xmath39 but also @xmath52 is not negligible and change the second coupling in the chargino decay channel ( fig.3 ) from @xmath39 to @xmath52 .",
    "that means that we have now @xmath53 in the final state , and this scenario will be dominated by the sm process given above with the z decay to the muon antimuon pair . in this way we can find that @xmath54 and @xmath55 charged lepton signals are testable ( meaning sensitivity to the products @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ) .    finally , our results can be easily applied to the muon - muon collider where another set of r - parity lepton violating couplings can be tested , namely : @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in the final state ) , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "present experimental limits on r - parity violating couplings do not exclude large and detectable lepton number violating signals in lepton - lepton collisions .",
    "we discuss such a possibility in conjunction with single chargino production and its subsequent leptonic decay .",
    "if at least one @xmath5 value is large enough - in our discussion mainly @xmath39 - single chargino production in electron - electron collisions will be observable ( fig.2 ) .",
    "if the chargino is nlsp and sneutrino the lsp , a unique lepton number violating signal of four charged leptons without missing energy could be observed .",
