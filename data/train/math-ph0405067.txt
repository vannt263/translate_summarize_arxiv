    "we study relativistic boundary cft on the half - plane @xmath1 .",
    "this is a local qft with a conserved and traceless stress - energy tensor , subject to a boundary condition at the boundary @xmath2 .",
    "as is well known , conservation and vanishing of the trace imply that the components @xmath3 and @xmath4 are chiral fields , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary condition is the absence of energy flow across the boundary , @xmath7 it follows that the components @xmath8 , @xmath9 of the stress - energy tensor are of the form @xmath10 i.e. , _ bi - local _ expressions in terms of the chiral field @xmath11 ( cf .  fig .  1 ) .    a point in the half space @xmath12",
    "a canonical field localized at @xmath13 is a bi - local linear combination of chiral field localized at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "apart from the stress - energy tensor , the theory may contain further chiral fields , such as currents , subject to an appropriate boundary condition ; e.g. , for a conserved current with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the vanishing of the charge flow across the boundary gives @xmath18 and @xmath19    it is crucial to contrast the bilocal form ( 1.2 ) , ( 1.4 ) of the chiral fields in boundary cft with the situation in 2d minkowski space cft , where , e.g. , the stress - energy tensor has the chiral decomposition @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two _ independent _ ( left and right ) chiral fields .",
    "a boundary cft contains only one chiral algebra with an appropriate identification between left and right movers .",
    "consequently , the representation space is a direct sum of representations of the chiral algebra , rather than of tensor products of representations of two chiral algebras .",
    "this ought to be ascribed to the fact that the imposing of boundary conditions and the ensuing breakdown of symmetry have so drastic consequences on the ground state fluctuations ( casimir effect ) that states respecting the boundary conditions can not be realized in the hilbert space of states without boundary conditions , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let us point out , however , that _ locally _ the two situations with @xmath23 and with @xmath21 and @xmath22 independent , are _ algebraically indistinguishable _ : for instance , in the latter case the commutator @xmath24 $ ] involves only @xmath25-function contributions at @xmath26 and at @xmath27 , while the commutator @xmath28 $ ] has additional contributions at @xmath29 and at @xmath30 .",
    "but within a wedge region @xmath31 ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) , the latter contributions are ineffective .",
    "the same holds for any time translate of @xmath34 .",
    "a slightly stronger version of this algebraic indistinguishability is the following : it has been shown that the chiral stress - energy tensor satisfies the _ split property _ : namely for every pair of intervals @xmath35 which do not touch ( thus allowing to smooth out the uv singularities ) , there exists a state @xmath36 in the vacuum hilbert space @xmath37 of @xmath11 ( depending on @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; in particular not the vacuum state ) which has no correlations among @xmath40 and @xmath41 when @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , @xmath36 factorizes on products of @xmath44 with @xmath45 according to @xmath46 this implies that , for every double - cone @xmath47 not touching the boundary ( hence @xmath15 and @xmath14 belong to non - touching intervals as before ) , there is a state @xmath36 such that products of @xmath48 given by ( 1.2 ) in the boundary cft with @xmath49 have the same expectation values in the state @xmath36 as the same products of @xmath48 given by ( 1.5 ) in the 2d minkowski space cft have in the state @xmath50 .",
    "this property exhibits the local `` decoupling '' of left and right chiral components .",
    "exactly as the split property fails when the intervals @xmath38 and @xmath39 touch , the decoupling of left- and right - movers breaks down at the boundary in bcft .",
    "we shall assume the split property for _ all _ chiral fields of a boundary cft .",
    "this property is known to be related to phase space properties of the cft ( existence of @xmath51 ) @xcite , and it has been established for large classes of chiral models ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us now turn to local fields in boundary cft which do not decompose in the manner of ( 1.2 ) or ( 1.4 ) .",
    "these non - chiral fields have to satisfy local commutativity with the chiral fields and with each other , and transform covariantly under the conformal ( mbius ) group generated by the chiral stress - energy tensor @xmath11 .",
    "the starting point in the present article will be the crucial observation that    non - chiral local fields in bcft arise from non - local chiral fields    by an algebraic construction ( explained in detail in sect .  2 ) .",
    "this construction gives also rise to a model - independent explanation ( sect .",
    "5 ) for an observation due to cardy @xcite concerning the structure of correlation functions .",
    "cardy has shown that @xmath52-point functions of primary local fields in boundary cft satisfy the same differential equations in the @xmath53 variables @xmath54 as chiral @xmath53-point conformal blocks of an associated two - dimensional minkowski space cft , and are therefore particular combinations of the latter .",
    "e.g. , the 4-point function of the order parameter in the critical ising model in the full plane factorizes as @xmath55 ( where the chiral 4-point conformal blocks @xmath56 and @xmath57 correspond to intermediate states in the vacuum sector and in the `` energy '' sector , respectively ) , whereas both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are 2-point functions of local fields on the half - plane @xmath12 .",
    "expressed in terms of exchange fields @xcite ( `` generalized chiral creation and annihilation operators '' ) , we have the operator factorization @xmath60 on the hilbert space @xmath61\\oplus \\left[{{\\cal h}}_{\\frac1{16}}\\otimes { { \\cal h}}_{\\frac1{16}}\\right]\\oplus \\left[{{\\cal h}}_{\\frac12}\\otimes{{\\cal h}}_{\\frac12}\\right]$ ] , where @xmath62 are the three sectors of the stress - energy tensor with @xmath63 , the exchange fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 and their adjoints interpolate among the three sectors of the chiral stress - energy tensor , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , ( 1.8 ) and ( 1.9 ) are two - point functions of local fields on the half - plane , given by @xmath68 defined on @xmath37 , and @xmath69 defined on @xmath70 . the local commutativity at space - like distance of the combinations ( 1.11 ) , ( 1.12 ) can be directly checked in terms of the exchange ( braid group ) commutation relations among @xmath71 , @xmath72 and their adjoints @xcite .",
    "of the two terms in ( 1.12 ) satisfies local commutativity with itself , it does so with @xmath73 only if @xmath74 is a multiple of a hermitean field .",
    "( ( 1.12 ) _ is _ hermitean up to a phase due to the exchange comutation relations @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xcite . ) on the other hand , any two hermitean combinations differ only by a unitary klein transformation ; thus up to a global phase and unitary similarity , the combination ( 1.12 ) is unique as a local quantum field . ] in this calculation , the specific ordering @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) is crucial . in particular , the combinations @xmath80 and @xmath74 given by ( 1.11 ) , ( 1.12 ) on the _ entire _ plane would fail to be _ local _ fields .",
    "we learn from this explicit example that the local fields in boundary cft carry a bi - localized product of charges of the chiral algebra , rather than a tensor product of left and right charges , as in minkowski space cft .",
    "moreover , they interpolate in very specific ways among the charged sectors of the chiral algebra , and these structures determine the scaling behavior of the fields as @xmath81",
    ". e.g. , the field @xmath80 has a singular behavior @xmath82 as @xmath81 , while the field @xmath74 vanishes @xmath83 at the boundary .",
    ", the variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 coalesce .",
    "thus , the scaling bahvior is controlled by the operator product expansion , and depends on the particular fusion channel selected by the bi - localization formula .",
    "] thus , we also see that the choice of a boundary condition is related to the bi - localized charge structure of the local fields .",
    "we shall investigate the origin of this charge structure in the general case .    for these purposes ,",
    "we look at boundary cft from the algebraic point of view @xcite .",
    "the algebraic point of view emphasizes the representation theoretic features of a qft , especially charges and their composition @xcite , rather than kinematical features such as analytic properties of correlation functions .",
    "the dhr theory of superselection sectors @xcite asserts that all information about charges ( superselection sectors ) , their composition ( `` fusion '' , operator product expansions ) , and their interchange ( `` statistics '' , commutation relations ) is encoded in a braided c * tensor category ( the dhr category for short ) , in terms of local observable quantities . this theory has been developed further into a powerful tool , useful for explicit computational purposes especially in the chiral setting .",
    "e.g. , the classification of local and non - local extensions of a given local qft has been cast into a problem of classification of _ q - systems _",
    "( @xcite , see sect .  4 and app .",
    "a ) within the dhr category .",
    "q - systems are an efficient tool to control the algebraic consistency of commutation relations , operator product expansions , and charge conjugation of primary and descendant fields at one stroke . under the natural assumption of `` complete rationality '' ( sect .",
    "2 ) , the classification of irreducible chiral extensions in cft has thus been shown to be a finite - dimensional problem with finitely many solutions ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath84 , a complete classification has been obtained along these lines @xcite .    furthermore , the existence of exchange fields as in ( 1.10)(1.12 ) with numerical braid group commutation relations and their operator product expansion could be established from general principles in the algebraic approach @xcite .",
    "rather than the local fields , say @xmath85 , the prime objects in the algebraic approach to qft are the von neumann algebras of local observables generated by the fields smeared with localized test functions , say @xmath86 for open space - time regions @xmath47 .",
    "the properties of the assignment @xmath87 ( the _ net of local algebras _ ) are axiomatized such that their generation by fields as in ( 1.13 ) becomes in fact obsolete and needs not be assumed at all .",
    "in our case , the chiral fields @xmath88 , ( @xmath89 ,  ) generate a chiral net of local von neumann algebras @xmath90 on the vacuum hilbert space @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , @xmath91 extends to a net over the intervals of the circle ( embedding @xmath92 into @xmath93 by means of a cayley transformation ) .",
    "the chiral fields of a boundary cft generate a net @xmath94 according to the prescription ( 1.13 ) , @xmath95 is generated by chiral fields smeared in the variable @xmath14 over the interval @xmath38 and in the variable @xmath15 over the interval @xmath39 , where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , is an open double - cone in @xmath12 .",
    "the bi - localized structure ( 1.2 ) , ( 1.4 ) etc .",
    ", translates into the form of the local algebras ( cf .",
    "2 ) @xmath98    a double - cone in the half space @xmath12 .",
    "an observable in @xmath95 is generated by chiral observables localized in @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ( searched for ) non - chiral local fields of the boundary cft will generate a net of local algebras in their vacuum representation @xmath99 with @xmath100 containing @xmath95 and consequently commuting with @xmath101 as @xmath102 is space - like from @xmath47 .",
    "but while @xmath103 is defined on the vacuum representation space @xmath37 of the chiral cft @xmath91 , the boundary cft @xmath104 will in general be defined on a larger hilbert space @xmath105 , i.e. , one has @xmath106 since we assume covariance and positive energy throughout , the representation @xmath107 of @xmath91 on @xmath108 is a positive - energy representation , containing the vacuum representation , with irreducible decomposition @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "we take the structure ( 1.14)(1.18 ) as the characteristic structure of algebraic boundary conformal qft , irrespective whether the nets are generated as in ( 1.13 ) by any specific set of generating local fields .",
    "our main results will be the following ( for any fixed chiral cft @xmath91 ) , referring to the body of the article for more detailed qualifications of the statements :    in sect .  2 , we provide several general results about the structure of local boundary cft s @xmath104 .",
    "every maximal local boundary cft @xmath104 can be recovered from its `` restriction to the boundary '' .",
    "the latter is some ( possibly non - local ) chiral extension @xmath111 of the chiral cft @xmath112 ( prop .",
    "2.9 ) , defined on the same hilbert space @xmath108 as @xmath104 .",
    "structural features of the latter ( reviewed and developed in sect .",
    "3 , where tomita s modular theory @xcite plays a crucial role ) are exploited to infer structural features of boundary cft .",
    "we shall refer to the ( re)construction of the boundary cft from a ( non - local ) chiral theory as _ ( boundary ) induction_.    these results show that the classification of ( non - local ) chiral extensions of a local chiral theory ( e.g. , in terms of q - systems ) at the same time provides a classification of boundary cft s .",
    "on the other hand , every ( non - local ) chiral extension @xmath113 of @xmath91 determines a local cft @xmath114 on two - dimensional minkowski space - time with left and right chiral observables @xmath115 ( henceforth referred to as the _ @xmath116-induction construction _ ) .",

    "1.6 ) .    in sect .  4",
    ", we discuss the relation between these two constructions of 2d nets ( boundary induction for the half - space vs.@xmath116-induction for minkowski space ) .",
    "indeed , the local inclusions @xmath119 and @xmath120 are algebraically isomorphic ( thm .",
    "4.1 ) . in this sense",
    ", the boundary cft constitutes a representation of the local degrees of freedom of the minkowski space theory @xmath121 which is consistent with the chiral boundary condition ( 1.1 ) and its generalizations such as ( 1.3 ) .",
    "but the representation spaces of @xmath104 and of @xmath114 are very different , one being a direct sum of sectors of @xmath91 , the other being a direct sum of tensor products of sectors . therefore inspite of the _ algebraic _ isomorphism , the bi - localized charge structure of the local fields on the half - space must be structurally different from the tensor product charge structure of the local fields in the plane , as is clearly exemplified by ( 1.11 ) or ( 1.12 ) vs.  ( 1.10 ) .",
    "we derive an explicit formula for the local charged fields ( prop .",
    "5.1 ) exhibiting their bi - localized charge structure in terms of non - local chiral exchange operators .",
    "the charge of a field @xmath85 is a product ( not a _",
    "tensor _ product ) of two chiral charges localized at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "this structure , and as a consequence the behavior of the charged fields and their correlations close to the boundary , is determined by the non - local chiral extension @xmath113 , i.e. , the choice of @xmath113 `` determines the boundary conditions '' .    in this sense ,",
    "the natural reasoning where one would impose the boundary conditions first , and then attempt to construct local fields subject to these conditions , is inverted .",
    "this avoids the problem with the usual strategy , that a consistent set of boundary conditions must be chosen in the first place , while it is not a priori clear what `` consistent '' would mean . as our analysis demonstrates implicitly , the algebraic constraints on the local fields to be constructed",
    "are highly involved : they consist in ( a ) the q - system describing the algebraic structure of the inclusion @xmath122 , and ( b ) the representation of this algebraic structure on a hilbert space @xmath108 . from these data which most sensitively depend on the dhr structure of the underlying chiral net @xmath91 ,",
    "the boundary conditions emerge , so that it is very unlikely that it should be possible to `` guess '' the consistent sets of boundary conditions without further specific insight . for this reason",
    ", we consider the present top - down strategy    chiral extension @xmath123 boundary condition    much more effective , since it is completely under control in the algebraic framework .    in sect .",
    "6 we show that along with a given ( non - local ) chiral extension @xmath113 , there is a whole family of non - local chiral extensions @xmath124 , all associated with the same minkowski space theory @xmath114 , and hence a family of boundary cft nets @xmath125 , which are all locally isomorphic , but whose local fields exhibit different bi - localized charge structures and satisfy different boundary conditions , in the sense just explained .",
    "the multiplicities of the hilbert spaces @xmath126 are the diagonal elements of a `` nimrep '' ( non - negative integer matrix representation ) of the fusion rules of @xmath91 : @xmath127 we include in sect .  7 some preliminary remarks on the relation to the modular structure of partition functions and boundary states .",
    "the structural analysis pursued in this article generalizes closely related previous analyses in complementary approaches . in the context of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics , cardy has already discussed @xcite the case @xmath128 ( in our terminology ) , leading to the set of boundary conditions being labelled by the sectors of @xmath91 . the same situation was investigated by felder , frhlich , fuchs and schweigert @xcite from the perspective of three - dimensional topological field theory .",
    "fuchs , runkel and schweigert @xcite proceeded to construct the coefficients of all @xmath53-point conformal blocks as in ( 1.8 ) , ( 1.9 ) in a combinatorial manner , where a condition very similar to our eq .",
    "( 5.12 ) was crucial to ensure locality .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have concentrated on graph theoretic aspects of the pertinent fusion algebras , and to a - d - e classification aspects in the case of @xmath129 current algebras , see also @xcite for a review .",
    "fuchs and schweigert @xcite have studied the generalization in which ( in our terminology ) @xmath91 is a subtheory ( not necessary of orbifold type ) of a chiral theory @xmath113 which is itself local .",
    "they also emphasized the role of @xmath116-induction .",
    "this case is known to give rise to block diagonal modular invariant matrices @xmath130 @xcite , and to this case also applies the result in @xcite .",
    "the same authors @xcite have further developed the purely categorial aspects characteristic of boundary cft , no longer referring to the underlying physical postulates .",
    "in fact , these structures fit most naturally in the general setting of tensor categories as exposed , e.g. , in @xcite .    in comparison to such a considerable gain of mathematical generality ( where quantum physics remains hardly visible ) , the motivation and ambition of our work is more limited . on the other hand , we study and explain specific representation theoretic issues which in the other frameworks are not or even can not be addressed . for these issues , operator algebraic methods are most powerful .",
    "we emphasize that in our approach the prominent principle is locality .",
    "in other approaches @xcite , inspired by statistical mechanics or string theory rather than quantum field theory , modular invariance of the partition function is taken instead as a first principle , required in order to guarantee that the theory can be consistently defined on arbitrary riemann surfaces .",
    "it is well known , however that ",
    "although closely related to each other  these principles can not be precisely mapped onto each other @xcite .",
    "in fact , we do not assume diffeomorphism invariance but only mbius invariance .",
    "assuming diffeomorphism invariance ( i.e. , the algebraic implementation of localized diffeomorphisms by suitable chiral observables ) , would allow some stronger results .",
    "e.g. , ( for an explanation of the notions , see the beginning of the next section ) , it was shown in @xcite that strong additivity would be automatic in a split net of finite @xmath131-index , and that the @xmath131-index coincides with the dimension of the dhr category . concerning boundary cft , one could infer that the index of the inclusion of the chiral observables in the bcft observables associated with a double - cone , does not depend on the double - cone , in spite of the fact that the mbius group does not act transitively on the double - cones in @xmath12 .",
    "we work with a fixed chiral conformal net @xmath112 over the intervals of the real axis @xcite , e.g. , a virasoro net with @xmath84 or a non - abelian current algebra ( affine kac - moody ) chiral net . in this article , @xmath91 is assumed to be _ completely rational _ @xcite .",
    "this condition combines _ rationality _",
