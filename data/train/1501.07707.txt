    "colloidal janus particles have drawn special attention during the past two decades for their potential in materials science  @xcite .",
    "janus particles are characterized by anisotropic surface chemical ( e.g. wetting or catalytic ) or physical ( e.g. optical , electric , or magnetic ) properties at well - defined areas on the particle .",
    "this combination of chemical anisotropy and response to external fields makes janus particles promising building blocks of reconfigurable and programmable self - assembled structures  @xcite .",
    "janus particles strongly adsorb at fluid - fluid interfaces  @xcite , making the formation of 2-d structures accessible . for symmetric janus particles composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic hemispheres ,",
    "the equilibrium contact angle is @xmath0 since each hemisphere immerses in its favourable fluid , and the interface remains flat  @xcite .",
    "however , due to surface roughness  @xcite , anisotropic shape  @xcite , or the influence of external forces , janus particles can tilt with respect to the interface . in a tilted orientation , the fluid - fluid interface around the janus particle deforms in a dipolar fashion in order to fulfil boundary conditions stipulated by young s equation  @xcite . assuming small interface deformations , the particle - induced interface deformations obey @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the interface height , which can be solved using a multipolar analysis , analagous to 2d electrostatics  @xcite .",
    "these particle induced deformations , called capillary interactions , can cause particles to attract and repel in specific orientations , making them a useful tool for controlling the behaviour of particles at interfaces .",
    "previous investigations into capillary interactions between particles at fluid - fluid interfaces have focussed mainly around two themes : particle weight - induced deformations , which lead to monopolar interactions between particles and are responsible for e.g. the cheerios effect  @xcite ; and surface roughness or shape anisotropy induced deformations , which lead to quadrupolar interactions between particles  @xcite and are responsible for e.g. the suppression of the coffee ring effect  @xcite . with respect to janus particles , brugarolas et al .",
    "@xcite showed that quadrupolar capillary interactions induced by surface roughness can be used to form fractal - like structures of janus nanoparticle - shelled bubbles .",
    "however , a significant limitation of the above mentioned capillary interactions is that they are not dynamically tunable because they depend on the particle properties alone .",

    "@xcite recently found a way of creating dynamically tunable dipolar capillary interactions between magnetic ellipsoidal particles adsorbed at an interface under the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the structures that form depend on the dipole - field coupling , which can be controlled dynamically  @xcite .",
    "it is also desirable to create tunable capillary interactions between spherical particles without relying on particle shape anisotropy .    in this paper",
    ", we show how to create tunable dipolar capillary interactions using spherical janus particles adsorbed at fluid - fluid interfaces .",
    "the janus particles have a dipole moment orthogonal to their janus boundary and are influenced by an external magnetic field directed parallel to the interface .",
    "the field causes the particles to experience a magnetic torque , but surface tension opposes this torque , and the particles therefore tilt with respect to the interface .",
    "when tilted , the particles deform the interface in a dipolar fashion .",
    "we develop a free energy based model of the behaviour of a single particle at the interface , and a model which takes into account small interface deformations .",
    "we numerically investigate the predictions of the models using lattice boltzmann simulations and highlight that the dipolar interface deformations lead to novel and interesting particle behaviour at the interface .",

    "<S> janus particles have attracted significant interest as building blocks for complex materials in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , capillary interactions have been identified as a promising tool for directed self - assembly of particles at fluid - fluid interfaces . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop theoretical models describing the behaviour of magnetic janus particles adsorbed at fluid - fluid interfaces interacting with an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> using numerical simulations , we test the models predictions and show that the magnetic janus particles deform the interface in a dipolar manner . we suggest how to utilise the resulting dipolar capillary interactions to assemble particles at a fluid - fluid interface , and further demonstrate that the strength of these interactions can be tuned by altering the external field strength , opening up the possibility to create novel , reconfigurable materials . </S>"
