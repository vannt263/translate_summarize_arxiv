    "conventionally , kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers of modes arise from the compactification of extra dimensions , i.e. the imposition of periodic boundary conditions on those finite extra dimensions , to render effectively the low - energy 4-d physics from a bigger spacetime with finite spatial extra dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given that standard model ( sm ) is the standard low - energy effective theory of particle interaction , one requires that any higher dimensional scenario reduces to the sm at the electroweak scale . from the kk perspective , this requires the lowest modes in kk towers of fermions to be chiral because these are the only ones we observe at low energy . to this end ,",
    "the simple periodic compactification needs to be replaced by an orbifold compactification and , in the case of one extra dimension , the common choice is @xmath0 compactification .    a novel mechanism has been proposed to localize standard model chiral fermions differently along extra dimensions making use of yukawa interaction of these fields with a background scalar field @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is phenomenologically very attractive , because it allows for an easy control of the 4-d effective couplings by regulating the overlap of particles wave functions in the extra dimensions . at the core of this mechanism",
    ", the necessary background scalar field of non - trivial vev profile along the extra dimension has been explicitly realized through the imposition of various orbifold boundary conditions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "because of the nature of this mechanism , one sees that the kk modes obtained are intimately related to the structure of this scalar vev in the transverse directions . at the same time , as in theories with finite extra dimensions , the usual periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. periodic compactification ) certainly drive kk towers back to the conventional structure .",
    "it is then of interest to analyze in details the interplay between these two tendencies revealed in the kk structure of related fields .    for this purpose ,",
    "we find it particularly useful to treat the dependence of fields on the extra dimensions as wavefunctions subject to the potential along the extra dimension associated with the background scalar kink solution ( or `` bulk potential '' in short ) , whose centers are located at fixed points of the orbifold . in what follows , these defects will be referred to as fat branes . in this view , we find that in the limit of a large extra dimension , bound ( i.e. normalizable ) kk states of massive fermions can actually exist at both fixed points , because bulk potential possesses local minima ( or `` potential wells '' ) at those points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] below ) .",
    "this differs from the conclusion of @xcite , where in the same limit of a large extra dimension , normalizable kk states are found only at one of fixed points .",
    "this approach further allows us to make a direct connection between the boundary conditions imposed on wavefunctions and the transmission amplitude in a related scattering process of particles on the branes .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the fermion localization mechanism @xcite in a model with one infinite extra dimension , where the extra dimensional wavefunction of fields and the corresponding kk mass can be exactly determined from the bulk potential viewpoint . in this limit , the periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) do not exist , so very distinct kk towers , partially discretized , originating from orbifold boundary conditions ( obcs ) can readily be seen .",
    "section iii generalizes the calculation to the case of a large , but finite , extra dimension . here",
    "the competition between the two types of boundary conditions becomes apparent .",
    "we show that , in this limit the obcs essentially require wavefunctions along the extra dimension of any single kk mode to have the same parity at all fixed points , whereas bulk potentials tend to make them different at these points ( see fig . [ fig.2 ] ) . as a result",
    ", this parity mismatch strongly affects kk light modes , while for the heavier kk modes , the same boundary conditions can be equivalently translated into the requirement that these kk fermions cross the branes without reflection .",
    "hence in all cases , obcs generally suppress many bound and low - lying kk modes .",
    "section iv will highlight the fact that symmetry breaking effects in the transverse dimension are actually encoded in the effective couplings , which in turn generate non - universal and kk - number non - conservation interaction vertices of fermion - gauge boson and fermion - scalar .",
    "sections iv - a and iv - b examine the implication of these effects on the coulomb potential and the one - loop correction to kk masses respectively from a 4-d effective viewpoint . in a different but related problem and in order to clarify the physical meaning of the kk mass equation obtained in orbifold compactification , section v studies the scattering of fermion on branes .",
    "it is found that low - lying kk modes of fermion indeed survive only when the resonant transmision through the branes occurs , which in turn is achieved only for some very particular values of brane s parameters .",
    "section vi summarizes our main results and offers some outlook .",
    "the appendix a classifies properties of general solutions of a hypergeometric - related differential equation encountered throughout the paper .",
    "consider the case of a massless fermion and a real scalar field in 4 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we use @xmath1 to denote the fifth dimension s coordinate , @xmath2 $ ] . in this section",
    "we will eventually let @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangians @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 are invariant under a @xmath7 symmetry @xmath8 @xmath9 which in turn allows the imposition of following orbifold and periodic boundary conditions @xmath10 @xmath11 we note that all fields are @xmath12-periodic and the imposition of these boundary conditions actually transforms the extra dimension into an orbifold @xmath13 with two fixed points at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath16 is antisymmetric at these points , if @xmath17 is sufficiently large , the minimization of effective potential @xmath18 @xmath19 gives rise to a non - constant solution @xmath20 of vev in the bulk .",
    "furthermore , in the limit @xmath21 considered in this section , it is just the well - known kink configuration @xmath22 first substitute @xmath23 in the leading approximation and then decompose @xmath24 into 4-d chiral components @xmath25 @xmath26 where the functions @xmath27 ) requires that @xmath28 be continuous functions because they represent probability amplitude of finding fermions in extra dimension . ]",
    "satisfy obcs ( [ obcpsi ] ) @xmath29 we obtain the equations of motion for 4-d chiral fields @xmath30 the 4-d dirac mass can be explicitly recovered when we take @xmath31 with @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath20 given in ( [ simplestsol ] ) , eqs .

[ fig.1 ]",
    "we see that , if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 becomes a `` potential hump '' and it possesses no bound states , thus for the sake of completeness , in the rest of this work we assume that @xmath43 is essentially smaller than @xmath44 .",

    "technical details are given in appendix a.    in the lower part of spectrum ( @xmath45 ) , bound kk masses are necessarily quantized @xmath46 @xmath47 where the ranges on @xmath48 come from constraints @xmath45 , @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions can be written in term of hypergeometric functions and are given in ( [ arbsol ] ) , ( [ albsol ] ) .",
    "the parity constraints ( [ obcxi ] ) on these wavefunctions further require @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be even and odd integer respectively .",
    "kk masses ( [ mrquantized ] ) , ( [ mlquantized ] ) are already a surprising result , because in the case @xmath21 , the usual free kk spectrum which arises from compactification is continuous . here , in contrast , kk spectrum is discretized for the first few levels ( @xmath52 ) because the whole spectrum has been spontaneously distorted by non - trivial vev through yukawa interaction . in other words ,",
    "the kk spectrum is now associated with the internal structure of fat brane , and not solely with the compactification .    in this bulk potential picture , for the zero mode @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 and no satisfying value of @xmath51 , because ( see fig . [ fig.1 ] )",
    "the @xmath55 level is even lower than the lower limit of potential @xmath42 , so only right - handed zero mode is normalizable and survives . in ( [ z2psi ] ) , one can inverse the situation where now only left - handed zero mode survives . ]",
    "this is one of the distinct features of this model , i.e. it possesses only single - chirality zero - mode fermions , which then can be identified with the standard model chiral fermions .",
    "various interesting phenomenological applications of fat brane models , such as fermion mass hierarchy , cp violation , baryogenesis and proton decay suppression , etc . have been carried out in numerous works ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - zero kk modes of mass @xmath56 come in pair of both chiralities with the relation ( [ mrquantized ] ) , ( [ mlquantized ] ) @xmath57 obviously , this assures the difference in parity of @xmath58 as earlier required by obcs . in the case",
    "@xmath59 is finite , relation ( [ nrl ] ) is rather strict that it apparently acts to suppress many light kk modes as we will see in the next section .",
    "we now proceed to the continuous spectrum , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . with the parity constraints ( [ obcxi ] )",
    "we can unambiguously solve for corresponding wavefunctions ( see ( [ areven ] ) , ( [ alodd ] ) ) , whose asymptotic forms are @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are given in ( [ acd ] ) , ( [ acd ] ) . clearly , under the refection @xmath67 , @xmath68 changes its signs but @xmath69 does not , i.e. they are manifestly antisymmetric and symmetric respectively at @xmath14 in these forms .",
    "however , we see also that matter waves propagate in both directions even as @xmath70 signaling the existence of other fixed points at infinity , from which waves reflect .",
    "but in the limit @xmath21 considered here , this reflection does not seem to be very reasonable .",
    "either ways , this is not more problematic , because the model of infinite extra dimension itself is not realistic as soon as we introduce gauge fields that can propagate in the bulk .",
    "for now we just note that the reflection - from - infinity is a consequence of orbifold boundary condition ( [ obcpsi ] ) imposed on fermion fields . in the next sections we investigate the case of finite extra dimension and this problem will no longer exist .",
    "similarly , one can analyze the kk expansion of background scalar field @xmath71 about its vev @xmath20 ( @xcite ) @xmath72 the orbifold boundary condition ( [ obcphi ] ) forces @xmath73 to be antisymmetric at all fixed points .",
    "@xmath74 plugging the expansion ( [ scalarexpansion ] ) into scalar action and keeping only terms up to quadratic order in @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 in the case @xmath78 we have ( [ simplestsol ] ) @xmath79 as before , the 4-d klein - gordon mass of kk scalar modes is recovered when @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 evidently , solutions of eq .",
    "( [ qmfeq ] ) are orthogonal to one another , and after integrating over @xmath82 we are left with a tower of 4-d scalars @xmath83 of mass @xmath84 in ( [ scalaraction ] ) .",
    "the general solutions of ( [ qmfeq ] ) are given in appendix a.    for the discrete spectrum , @xmath85 , we have only one bound eigenstate antisymmetric at @xmath14 ( [ afsol ] ) of quantum numbers ( [ anf ] ) @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 corresponding to kk mass @xmath89 .    for the continuous spectrum , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the wavefunction @xmath92 being antisymmetric at @xmath14 can be found ( see([afodd ] ) ) .",
    "its asymptotic form is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is given in ( [ adbar ] ) .",
    "this shows that , just like the case of fermion mentioned below eq .",
    "( [ assyml ] ) , the orbifold boundary condition ( [ obcf ] ) gives rise to the non - physical reflection - from - infinity of background scalar wavefunctions in the extra dimension .",
    "this point will be clarified below in a more realistic scenario where the other orbifold fixed point is taken into account by considering large , but not infinite @xmath59 .",
    "in the model of infinite and flat extra dimension investigated in the last section , kk masses and wavefunctions can be solved exactly , but it may not be realistic as soon as the sm gauge bosons or the graviton are introduced . in this section",
    "we consider a more realistic situation where @xmath59 is no longer infinite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that in a certain limit of large but finite @xmath59 , we are still able to carry out the computation with a very good approximation .",
    "first we note that all potentials of the forms ( [ chiralv ] ) , ( [ inftydelta ] ) have the same characteristic width @xmath95 , so if @xmath59 is several times larger than @xmath96 , the two potential wells centered at @xmath14 and @xmath15 are neatly separated .",
    "consequently , we can solve the eigenstates of this double - well potential by joining eigenstates of individual wells together .",
    "indeed when @xmath97 , the corresponding solution of ( [ veveq1 ] ) antisymmetric at @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( by obcs ( [ obcphi ] ) ) is @xmath98 which together with ( [ ansatz ] ) gives rise to new composite potentials @xmath99    in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we sketch the potentials ( [ inftychiralv ] ) for the case @xmath100 ( to be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "the important observation here is that , the potentials @xmath101 and @xmath102 exchange their shapes at fixed points , where only one of two first terms in ( [ inftychiralv ] ) contributes significantly . we will now attempt to compute the kk masses and corresponding wavefunctions in this limit through a matching process . eqs .",
    "( [ qmxieqr ] ) , ( [ qmxieql ] ) become @xmath103 where @xmath104 now are given in ( [ inftychiralv ] ) . for the light modes , @xmath45 , @xmath105 , wavefunctions which are bound to each component",
    "well are given in ( [ arbsol ] ) , ( [ albsol ] ) , all of which decay to zero as fast as @xmath106 at the region separating the two wells ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "so as far as the amplitude is concerned , the matching of two individual wavefunctions of the same @xmath37 is automatic .",
    "however , the parity matching is not so obvious . at the same squared mass level @xmath37",
    ", @xmath69 behaves like component right - handed wavefunction at @xmath14 and left - handed wavefunction at @xmath15 , so in view of ( [ obcxi ] ) , if @xmath69 is symmetric at @xmath14 , it must be antisymmetric at @xmath15 or vice - versa . whereas obcs ( [ obcxi ] ) also require that @xmath69 be symmetric at all fixed points .",
    "so if @xmath69 were a solution satisfying these apparently contradictory conditions on parity and were non - zero in the vicinity of @xmath14 , then it should be zero around @xmath15 , because null function is the only function being both symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to a given reference point .",
    "and the same parity mismatch holds for left - handed states . as @xmath108 ,",
    "@xmath109 are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric at fixed points , fig .",

    "though @xmath113 increases exponentially as y runs away from @xmath15 , we think that the matching of this function with zero - mode state ( [ arbsol ] ) bound to fixed point @xmath14 , which decreases exponentially into the bulk , would necessarily set the constant @xmath114 to zero in order to preserve the normalization of @xmath113 in the limit of large l. as a result , the right - handed zero mode exists only around @xmath14 while certain higher normalizable modes can exist around both fixed points as seen in the bulk potential picture ( fig . [ fig.2 ] ) . ]",
    "these towers do not essentially correlate , but in the limit @xmath115 stronger tunneling may change the qualitative picture .",
    "we can see this more clearly now by studying the upper part of spectrum , where @xmath60 , @xmath116 . here",
    "the matching process is simple , because as noted earlier , at the matching region in between the two wells , the wavefunctions associated with each well already fully reach their asymptotic forms .",
    "let us first consider the right - handed modes ( symmetric at all fixed points ) .",
    "when the fixed points at @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively taken to be the origin of the y - coordinate , the symmetric wavefunction @xmath108 at the matching point ( @xmath107 ) reads ( see ( [ areven ] ) , ( [ aleven ] ) ) @xmath117 @xmath118 the matching of ( [ massymr ] ) and ( [ massymr ] ) induces the following relation @xmath119 since @xmath120 is 2l - periodic ( [ obcpsi ] ) , we can rewrite ( [ relation1 ] ) as @xmath121 the first of these equations is the usual periodic boundary conditions , while the second accounts for orbifold boundary conditions and effect of fat branes . because @xmath122 , @xmath123s all are functions of @xmath124 , ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , ( [ mcondition2 ] ) are actually equations determining kk masses .    matching antisymmetric left - handed wavefunctions produces relations identical to ( [ mcondition1 ] ) and ( [ mcondition2 ] ) , this ensures the equality of 4-d left and right - handed fermion masses in the same kk mode .",
    "remarkably , the physical meaning of condition ( [ mcondition2 ] ) can be viewed as the requirement that the transmission amplitude of fermions in the double - brane system needs to be exactly one .",
    "quantitative discussion will be given in section v. however the assertion s outcome itself is readily plausible : once the transmission amplitude is one , the kk states propagate in the bulk as if there were no potential at all , and subsequently the periodic boundary condition ( [ mcondition1 ] ) drives them to the conventional structure . as a result , we expect high - lying modes of kk spectrum to have structure closer to that of periodic compactification .",
    "let us now examine the compatibility of two conditions ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , ( [ mcondition2 ] ) . for very heavy kk modes ( @xmath125 ) , @xmath63 , @xmath65 and @xmath64 , @xmath66 approach one and zero respectively , and",
    "the condition ( [ mcondition2 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "then ( [ mcondition1 ] ) implies @xmath126 , which is the usual kk mass from periodic compactification . for smaller values of @xmath122",
    ", it may be difficult to solve ( [ mcondition2 ] ) analytically although a numerical approach is possible . in section",
    "v we will discuss the solution of this equation in the limit of small @xmath122 .",
    "here we just mention that for @xmath122 which is not very large , the two conditions ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , ( [ mcondition2 ] ) are not always compatible . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider a special case where @xmath127 is an integer . using @xmath128 and ( [ adrelations ] )",
    ", we find @xmath129 and @xmath130 eq . ( [ mcondition2 ] ) becomes a polynomial equation of order @xmath131 , so it has at most @xmath132 solutions of @xmath133 ( or squared mass @xmath37 ) , which may or may not satisfy ( [ mcondition1 ] ) . in any cases ,",
    "the combination of ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , ( [ mcondition2 ] ) gives no more than @xmath132 different exact values of @xmath37 in the range of not - too - large @xmath122 ( @xmath134 ) , while in a conventional compactification ( [ mcondition1 ] ) the number of kk states in the same range is @xmath135 . is a special `` resonant '' case , where eq .",
    "( [ mcondition2 ] ) is approximately satisfied for very small values of k. ] combined with the earlier consideration for bound kk states , we see clearly that the lower part of kk spectrum is strongly distorted by spontaneous breaking of background scalar , to which fermions are coupled , and also by orbifold boundary conditions , and the latter are generally strict that many of these states are effectively suppressed .",
    "the higher levels are not essentially affected by bulk potential ( their transmission coefficient is close to unity ) and usual periodic boundary conditions drive their mass structure to that of conventional compactification .    we now briefly investigate the kk scalar structure ( [ scalarexpansion ] ) , ( [ qmfeq ] ) in the limit @xmath136 by a similar method . in this limit , the potential ( [ inftydelta ] ) becomes ( see([compositesol ] ) ) @xmath137 this potential is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] for @xmath138 .",
    "we see that two component wells are identical ( i.e. the potential is l - periodic ) and no parity mismatch occurs .",
    "further , in the limit @xmath136 , discrete scalar kk levels bound to the first well are not interfered by those bound to the second and still we have only one antisymmetric kk state ( [ discretsolf ] ) with mass @xmath139 in the lowest part of spectrum .    for the higher modes , @xmath140 , the matching of scalar wavefunctions @xmath141 ( [ afodd ] ) antisymmetric at all fixed points generates following relations @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "these equations have at most two exact solutions @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( the latter is a true solution if only @xmath146 is integer ) corresponding to @xmath147 and @xmath148",
    ". however , for all @xmath149 or @xmath150 , the condition ( [ mcondition2s ] ) is approximately satisfied and in these ranges , only the periodic boundary condition ( [ mcondition1s ] ) effectively governs the kk masses and gives them the conventional structure up to a constant shift @xmath151 where @xmath152 or @xmath153 .",
    "as scalars are not chiral , they do not suffer from parity mismatch and consequently their transmission coefficient can reach to unity not only for high - lying kk levels , but also for levels immediately above the surface of potential well .",
    "this `` resonant behavior '' of potential ( [ inftydelta ] ) was discovered long time ago ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , in the difference with the result obtained therein , here scalar fields are constrained to be antisymmetric by obcs , then resonance occurs only in two above ranges of momentum @xmath154 .",
    "this special structure of kk scalar spectrum has important implications in practical calculation as we will see in the following fermion self - energy evaluation .",
    "it is well known that in universal extra dimension ( ued ) scenario ( see e.g. @xcite ) where no localization mechanism is invoked and all extra dimensions are accessible to all fields , momentum is conserved in both longitudinal ( infinite ) and transverse ( finite ) directions of space .",
    "this in turn implies the kk - number conservation of all vertex interactions and there are no tree - level contributions from kk excitation to standard model observables , whose content fields are taken to be the zero - modes in kk tower picture .",
    "the situation is quite different in brane scenario , where lorentz invariance is violated along transverse dimensions due to both background kink and orbifold compactification .",
    "consequently , in the reduced 4-d picture , there exist kk - number non - conservation vertices characterized by effective couplings .",
    "this is because the overlap - integration over extra coordinates leading to 4-d couplings actually measures the effects of lorentz invariance breaking left on the wavefunctions of related fields along the extra dimension .",
    "these couplings may give rise to new interesting phenomenologies such as tree - level flavor changing neutral current , new mixing of quark and lepton flavors , etc .",
    "the comparison of these new contributions with experimental data will provide bounds on various parameters of the model . in this section , just for the purpose of illustration , we will present a toy model which involves only one fermion flavor in order to study the new implications , if any , of brane scenario to coulomb interaction in a tree - level consideration and to the kk masses up to one - loop level .      charged fermions in qed interact with one another by exchanging a photon .",
    "we now assume that the photon can propagate freely along the fifth dimension , otherwise the localization mechanism for gauge boson in the exact fashion as we did for fermions encounters a serious complication related to the issue of universality of charge .",
    "the @xmath13 obcs turn the extra dimensional wavefunction of the photon kk modes in the form of cosine or sine functions depending on their transformation property under @xmath155 .",
    "the usual choice of photon s first four components @xmath156 being symmetric and the fifth @xmath157 antisymmetric at @xmath158 eliminates the zero mode of @xmath157 as well as the contribution of its kk excitations @xmath159 to zero - mode charged fermions interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ) .    after dimensional reduction , we obtain the following vertex coupling of fermion zero - mode and photon kk modes : @xmath160 where @xmath161 s are 4-d effective couplings @xmath162 and @xmath163 is the usual 4-d charge of fermion zero mode , whose wave function is @xmath164 as given in ( [ arbsol ] ) . in the non - relativistic limit , the potential between two charged fermion zero",
    "modes can be found by working out the kk photon exchange process depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] .",
    "the result is @xmath165 where @xmath166 denotes the spatial separation in 4-d picture .",
    "the first term of ( [ coulombv ] ) presents the contribution of massless photon , while remaining terms come from its massive kk modes . by transforming the sum over mode s index @xmath167 into the sum over elements of a geometric series , and approximating @xmath168 to a gaussian function ( [ gaussianfn ] ) , we obtain the following expression for the potential @xmath169 : @xmath170 if @xmath171 , ( and @xmath172 so that the contribution from the z - boson can be neglected ) , the potential ( [ leadingv ] ) takes the form @xmath173 where we have kept only a few terms of higher orders",
    ". the first term in ( [ v(r > l ) ] ) is the usual coulomb interaction potential arising from the exchange of the zero mode of the photon , whereas the second term has a yukawa potential form because it is mediated by an infinite tower of massive kk modes .",
    "this correction is considerable only when @xmath166 approaches the size of the extra dimension , and the brane s explicit contribution to this correction is at most few percents in the limit @xmath174 , so it is unlikely that we could find some phenomenological bounds on model s parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 by just looking at the static coulomb interaction potential .",

    "specific solutions of @xmath198 ( [ arbsol ] ) , ( [ albsol ] ) and @xmath199 ( [ afsol ] ) , ( [ afodd ] ) suggest that for kk modes relevant to the self - energy diagram ( @xmath200 ) , the characteristic width of normalized wavefunction of kk fermion @xmath201 in the extra dimension is much smaller than that of @xmath202 ( of scalar field ) as @xmath44 is sufficiently larger than @xmath43 . in the upper limit of the sum , but contribution from these modes are actually suppressed by factor @xmath203 for a rough estimation we neglect the variation of @xmath202 over the extent of @xmath201 , then for each relevant mode @xmath204 , couplings @xmath184 are most enhanced for few modes @xmath185 closest to @xmath167 ( i.e. when @xmath205 ) , because it is when @xmath206 resembles @xmath207 most ( i.e. @xmath208 ) . along this approximation , the fermionic kk zero - mode mass should receives a rather small 1-loop correction , because it has no corresponding `` closest - neighbor '' mode @xmath207 with @xmath209 , i.e. @xmath210 . our estimation is verified by a particular numerical evaluation of coupling @xmath184 as function of mode s indices @xmath167 ,",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] , where one can see clearly the effect of closest - neighbor enhancement on the value of couplings .",
    "the value of these couplings indeed decreases very quickly off the diagonal @xmath211 .    putting all observations together , for kk non - zero mode of fermion we have @xmath212 where @xmath213 accounts for the number of relevant kk scalar modes in the sum and some crude estimation that we have made .",
    "we note also that @xmath214 is just 4-d version of squared coupling @xmath215 .",
    "this one - loop divergence requires the corresponding counter terms @xmath216 with renormalization scaling factors @xmath217 after transforming to canonical basis @xmath218 we finally obtain an one - loop correction to the mass of fermionic kk non - zero mode ( in the leading order ) @xmath219 where @xmath181 s are given by ( [ mrquantized ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the same result is obtained in @xcite , where one - loop correction to kk mass in ued scenario was computed using fundamental 5-d approach ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this would indicate that , at tree - level , kk mass structures in fat brane and ued scenarios are very different at least in the lower part as we have seen in previous sections , however their radiative correction may scale somewhat similarly .",
    "we particularly note that , obcs and fat brane structure contribute crucially to the mass shift ( [ 1-loop ] ) at two places .",
    "first , the obcs ( [ mcondition1s ] ) , ( [ mcondition2s ] ) eliminate most of scalar kk states that otherwise would have appeared in the fermion self - energy diagram .",
    "second , non - trivial interaction in extra dimension is manifested entirely in analytical properties of effective 4-d couplings @xmath184 that in turn enhance certain modes of mixing .",
    "this non - trivial mixing has certain important implications to standard model and that will be presented in the subsequent work .",
    "we now turn to some resonant effect on kk spectrum of fermions .",
    "the consideration of section iii has led to the conclusion that orbifold boundary conditions , which are crucial ingredients in achieving single - chirality standard model fermions as zero - modes of fields in a higher dimensional theory , act to suppress many bound ( @xmath220 ) fermionic kk levels .",
    "each of these levels wavefunctions has a definite parity with respect to a fixed point , and if this parity is not identical to the one imposed by obcs , the corresponding level is suppressed by parity mismatch .",
    "higher levels ( @xmath221 ) is two - fold degenerate and can be arranged to have the desired parities ( appendix a ) , so the impact of obcs on these levels is not so obvious . in this section",
    "we discuss in more details the structure of this upper part of kk spectrum and clarify a close connection between periodic boundary conditions , orbifold boundary conditions and the complex transmission amplitude of free fermion through the double - brane system mentioned in section iii .",
    "we first consider a related problem of one non - compact dimension where a fermion , being free at infinity , approaches a single double - well potential @xmath222 ( [ inftychiralv ] ) ( fig . [ fig.2 ] ) with wave vector @xmath223 . in this problem ,",
    "the wavefunction of particle is not constrained by any boundary conditions since the dimension is non - compact . because the double - well is not left - right symmetric",
    ", we expect that the complex reflection amplitudes are not the same for two opposite propagation directions .",
    "the most general particle s wavefunction and its asymptotic forms as referred to the fixed point at @xmath14 are respectively ( see ( [ arcont1 ] ) , ( [ arcont2 ] ) ) @xmath224 as referred to the fixed point at @xmath15 , similarly we have @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are constant coefficients .    for the wave traveling from left to right and scattering on the double - brane , we let @xmath228 and the matching of ( [ assymgeneralr+ ] ) and ( [ assymgeneralr- ] ) gives @xmath229 and @xmath230 . next ,",
    "using relations ( [ adrelations ] ) @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 we obtain the transmission amplitude @xmath234 now we see clearly that conditions ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , ( [ mcondition2 ] ) imply the physical requirement that the complex transmission amplitude of a fermion propagating through a single double - well potential @xmath222 is precisely one",
    ". we will come back to this observation below .",
    "a similar consideration gives identical transmission amplitude for wavefunction subject to the other type of a single double - well potential @xmath42 ( [ inftychiralv ] ) : @xmath235 . from here on we drop all indices @xmath236 as well as the factor @xmath237 in the expression of @xmath238 by virtue of ( [ mcondition1 ] ) .    for @xmath239 , we saw earlier that @xmath240 , i.e. the higher kk structure is always dominated by usual periodic compactification .",
    "now we can see this result more physically : the high - lying kk modes have lagre transmission amplitude @xmath241 because they are not sensitive to the underlying potential and can cross it without significant reflection , and on these modes , the periodic boundary conditions ( [ mcondition1 ] ) are the more influential ones .",
    "however , as seen in previous section , the couplings @xmath242 and @xmath243 in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) have negative dimensions of mass , so the theory is not renormalizable",
    ". it may effectively describe physics only under a certain mass scale , and our calculation may be no longer relevant for heavy kk modes above that scale . apart from this",
    ", smaller range of values of @xmath122 deserves a special interest , also because it is where the fat brane structure is expected to play a dominant role . to see this",
    "specifically , we now examine the mass quantization equation @xmath244 ( [ mcondition2 ] ) for low - lying fermionic kk states , @xmath245 . using the product expansion @xcite @xmath246",
    "we can expand @xmath63 as follows @xmath247\\pi + ik\\frac{u}{w } + ik\\sum_{q=1}^{\\infty } ( \\frac{2}{q}-\\frac{1}{q - w / u } -\\frac{1}{q+w / u } ) + { \\cal o } ( k^3 ) \\right ) }   \\nonumber \\\\     & = & |d_1|\\exp { \\left ( -i\\frac{\\pi}{2 } + i[\\frac{w}{u}]\\pi + ik\\frac{u}{w } + ik(2\\gamma + \\psi(\\frac{w}{u})+ \\psi(\\frac{-w}{u } ) ) + { \\cal o } ( k^3 ) \\right ) }   \\nonumber               \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath248 $ ] is the maximal integer not larger than @xmath249 , @xmath250 is polygamma function , and @xmath251 is euler - mascheroni constant . after expanding @xmath65 in a similar way and using recursion formula @xmath252",
    "we obtain @xmath253 with @xmath254 now putting this back into the expression ( [ tr ] ) of transmission amplitude , we find @xmath255 where @xmath256 , @xmath257 have been calculated in appendix a @xmath258 has values such that @xmath259 in ( [ defofp ] ) or @xmath260 in ( [ squaredd1d1d2 ] ) vanishes , one can see that @xmath261 , i.e. the condition ( [ mcondition2 ] ) is approximately satisfied for low - lying kk modes @xmath262 . using condition ( [ mcondition1 ] ) , this means @xmath263 , and since we are considering the limit @xmath264 , this approximation holds for a certain number of modes .",
    "this again can be seen as a resonance behavior of the potentials ( [ inftychiralv ] ) that for certain values of @xmath265 , even low - lying particles can essentially go through it , and condition ( [ mcondition1 ] ) then determines their masses @xmath266 .",
    "the resonance values of @xmath265 are positive integers ( for @xmath267 ) and others being solutions of equation @xmath268 . from fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] we see that , there is exactly one such solution between any two successive integers .    for all other values of @xmath265",
    ", we find that @xmath269 and equation @xmath244 does not have solutions for @xmath270 .",
    "in other words , branes are almost `` opaque '' for low - lying modes and consequently , these fermion modes are absent in the kk spectrum .    in overal , except for some particular values of bulk potential parameter @xmath265 , we see that the lower part of kk spectrum of fermions is strongly distorted ( i.e. suppressed ) by orbifold compactification and the vev of the background scalar field .",
    "in this work we attempt to investigate the effect of finite size of extra dimension , in the presence of a background scalar field , on masses and wavefunctions of kk modes of fermions and scalar fields by invoking the analog bulk potential , which is closely related to the brane picture generated by the kink solution of the scalar field equation .",
    "the size of these branes is finite ( namely fat branes ) and comparable to that of the kink . the compactification of the extra dimension to obtain a low - energy 4-d realistic chiral theory involves different types of boundary conditions : the usual periodic boundary conditions which dominate the high - lying kk modes and give them the familiar structure of conventional compactification , and the orbifold boundary conditions , which along with non - trivial fat branes dominate the bound and low - lying kk modes , thus give them more a distinctive structure .",
    "the observation being emphasized here is that these conditions on wavefunctions are not always compatible , depending on the specific values of the parameters of the model through some resonance effects .",
    "the general result is that , certain light fermionic kk modes are suppressed making incomplete the kk tower of fermions bound to each fixed points . in this respect , we see that scalar fields are less affected by obcs , because they are not chiral . roughly speaking ,",
    "the limit separating the two very different parts of the spectrum is of the order of the potential barrier s height experienced by particles along the extra dimension , and this could serve as the cut - off scale required by a non - renormalizable higher dimensional theory . integrating out the extra dimension leads to an effective 4-d theory .",
    "the effects of orbifold compactification and symmetry breaking in the transverse dimension are now embedded in the effective couplings , and the corresponding vertex interactions do not necessarily conserve the kk number .",
    "this in turn generates the contribution of kk modes to tree and higher - level processes . making use of the analytical solutions of the kk masses and wavefunctions obtained in this paper",
    ", we will return to the implications of this brane picture to the standard model in a subsequent work .",
    "for an extra dimension of arbitrary size , certain numerical techniques are required to solve for the background scalar vev subject to given orbifold boundary conditions .",
    "the matching of component wavefunctions is not simple , but we believe that the use of bulk potential would remain the right approach to find kk masses and their state functions in this general case .",
