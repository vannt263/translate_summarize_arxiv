    "@xmath93 , i.e. the union of the orbits of critical points under the iterates of @xmath8 , is a finite set .",
    "it has long been known that the post - critical set plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the polynomial .",
    "indeed , the class of dynamical systems corresponding to post - critically finite polynomials is a well - studied one , having gained prominence following a celebrated theorem of thurston ; see , for example , douady - hubbard @xcite , bielefed - fisher - hubbard @xcite , as well as the papers by poirier @xcite , pilgrim @xcite , and pakovich @xcite ; the latter two concern the connection with actions of @xmath94 on certain finite trees .",

    "if @xmath8 is post - critically finite , every specialization @xmath95 of this tower is finitely ramified .",
    "the first assertion of the theorem is clear geometrically since @xmath96 . the second assertion , however , is not a formal consequence of the first , since any element of @xmath0 is a unit in @xmath9 ; the proof we give for it proceeds via proposition [ prop : recur ] , where we calculate a recurrence for the discriminant of @xmath12 ( valid for an arbitrary polynomial @xmath8 ) , giving a more precise version of the theorem .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop : recur ] rests on a riemann - hurwitz genus formula for polynomials @xcite .",

    "since all finitely ramified @xmath17-adic galois representations with infinite image are expected , by a conjecture of fontaine and mazur , to be wildly ( even deeply ) ramified at some prime of residue characteristic @xmath17 , an immediate question is what can be said about the presence of wild ramification in specialized iterated extensions @xmath95 .",
    "experimentation leads to the expectation that generically the primes of residue characteristic dividing @xmath45 ramify deeply in @xmath95 .",
    "for example , if @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 , then for all @xmath105 , the extensions @xmath95 are deeply ramified at all @xmath17 dividing @xmath45 .",
    "( see , however , questions [ ques:1 ] and [ ques:2 ] in  [ sec : conjectures ] ) .",
    "under an assumption of good reduction for @xmath8 , we prove a partial result toward this expectation , namely for integral @xmath67 , we estimate from below the power of @xmath17 dividing the discriminant of @xmath62 . to be precise , in ",
    "[ sec : wild ] , we will prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : wild1 ] let @xmath0 be a number field .",

    "then for any @xmath106 , @xmath107    assuming @xmath62 is @xmath0-irreducible for all @xmath7 , this estimate shows that the tower of rings @xmath108 $ ] , where @xmath109 is a compatible sequence of roots of @xmath62 , is wildly ramified at @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath108 $ ] is an _",
    "order _ inside the maximal order of @xmath110 ; it is the discriminant of the latter which is our primary interest , but the theorem estimates the discriminant of the former .",
    "this is one sense in which the above theorem is only a partial answer to our question about wild ramification in iterated extensions . on the other hand , in section [ sec : quad ] , we illustrate with the tower corresponding to @xmath111 , the possibility that the orders @xmath112 $ ] ( for a large set of @xmath113 ) are maximal , giving examples of monogne number fields .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in  [ sec : prelim ] , we outline some preliminary facts regarding post - critically finite polynomials , including a classification of the very simplest examples for each degree , namely those that are _ critically fixed _ ( every critical point is fixed , also known as _ conservative _ ) and _ simply ramified _ ( every non - trivial ramification index is @xmath114 ) . in   [ sec : pcf ] and [ sec : wild ] , we prove theorems [ thm:1 ] [ thm : wild1 ] ) , respectively . in  [ sec : decomposition ] , we describe the decomposition of unramified primes in iterated towers in terms of simple properties of certain finite graphs . in  [ sec : quad ] , we study the quadratic case in more detail , obtaining a recursion for writing down post - critically finite quadratic polynomials , which give number fields of independent interest ; we also discuss the example @xmath115 in detail , proving monogenicity of certain number fields .",

    "we have the recurrence formula @xmath525 which coincides up to sign with the recurrence ( [ recurd ] ) for @xmath477 .",

    "in this section , we discuss in a bit more detail conjectural and known properties of iterated monodromy representations , especially as compared with those of @xmath17-adic representations .",
    "we also list a number of open problems .",
    "let us first recall a conjecture of fontaine and mazur : if @xmath0 is a number field and @xmath18 is a finite set of places of @xmath0 none of which has residue characteristic @xmath17 , then all finite - dimensional @xmath17-adic representations of @xmath25 factor through a finite quotient ( see conj .",
    "5a of @xcite as well as kisin - wortmann @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , infinite tamely and finitely ramified extensions of number fields do exist ( and are in plentiful supply ) thanks to the criterion of golod and shafarevich , see e.g. roquette @xcite .",
    "thus , at least for certain pairs @xmath529 , there is a sizeable portion of @xmath25 which is predicted to be invisible to finite - dimensional @xmath17-adic representations .",
    "when @xmath18 contains all places above @xmath17 , it is also expected , by a conjecture of boston @xcite ( which we recall below ) , that @xmath17-adic representations do not capture all of @xmath25 .",
    "suppose @xmath530 is a residual representation of @xmath25 . by mazur s theory of deformations",
    ", there exists a universal ring @xmath531 ( local , noetherian and complete ) and a versal deformation @xmath532 such that @xmath533 is the restriction of @xmath534 .",
    "let @xmath535 be the subfield of @xmath19 fixed by @xmath536 .",
    "we put @xmath537 where @xmath538 is the maximal pro-@xmath17 extension of @xmath397 inside @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath18 contains all place above @xmath17 ( @xmath17 odd , or for @xmath17 even we assume @xmath0 is totally complex ) , then the cohomological dimension of @xmath539 is at most @xmath114 .",
    "the purely group - theoretical conjecture b of boston @xcite concerning the rank - growth of subgroups of @xmath540 , then implies the _ non - injectivity conjecture _",
    "( @xcite , p. 91 ) to the effect that @xmath534 is never injective . in a certain sense",
    ", one expects that @xmath534 forgets a non - trivial part of @xmath539 .",
    "how can one shed light on those sides of arithmetic fundamental groups which are apparently not illuminated by the theory @xmath17-adic representations ? as a counterpoint to the fontaine - mazur conjecture , a conjecture of boston",
    "@xcite asserts that infinite tame quotients of @xmath541 possess faithful actions on rooted trees .",
    "iterated monodromy groups are canonically equipped with such an action @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to seek such representations via specializations of iterated towers of post - critically finite polynomials , in the wild case as well as in the tame case . in the wild case , it would be interesting to produce iterated monodromy representations whose image does not have any infinite @xmath17-adic analytic quotients . since very little is known about the structure of infinite tamely and finitely ramified extensions of number fields ,",
    "the following question is of particular interest .      1 .   for each @xmath13 , @xmath62 is irreducible over @xmath0 , ( i.e. @xmath544 is a field of degree @xmath40 over @xmath0 ) , 2 .",
    "there is a finite set @xmath18 of places of @xmath0 such that @xmath545 is unramified outside @xmath18 for all @xmath13 , and such that 3 .",

    "tamely ramified_. it is not difficult to arrange i ) and iii ) simultaneously by imposing congruence conditions ( e.g. see example [ ex : tame ] ) .",
    "however , satisfying all conditions together appears to be quite difficult .",
    "a positive answer to question [ ques:1 ] would provide , for the first time , an explicit method for constructing an infinite tamely and finitely ramified extension of a number field .",
    "currently the only method for producing such extensions is via the golod - shafarevich criterion . on the other hand , a negative answer would assert that an analogue of the fontaine - mazur conjecture holds for finitely ramified iterated extensions .",
    "we should mention that for the function field of a curve over a finite field with a square number of elements , recursive constructions of garcia - stichenoth ( see @xcite for example ) for tamely and finitely ramified extensions exist ; that such constructions always arise from modular curves is a conjecture of elkies @xcite . recall that an algebraic extension @xmath397 over a number field @xmath0 is called _ asymptotically good _",

    "a more general and more concise version of question [ ques:1 ] is the following .",
    "under the assumption of good reduction of the polynomial @xmath8 , the analogue of this question where we replace the number field discriminant with the polynomial discriminant , has a negative answer by theorem [ thm : wild1 ] .",
    "namely , for a polynomial @xmath548 $ ] of degree @xmath28 , define its root discriminant by @xmath549 . an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm : wild1 ] is    [ cor : wild1 ] if @xmath550 $ ] is post - critically finite , has degree divisible by @xmath17 , and has good reduction at @xmath17 , then for any @xmath457 , the sequence of polynomials @xmath551 is asymptotically bad in the sense that ( the @xmath17-part of ) @xmath552 tends to infinity with @xmath7 .",
    "this result is in agreement with a conjecture of simon @xcite , to the effect that any infinite sequence of distinct polynomials over @xmath352 is asymptotically bad .",
    "thus , to tackle questions [ ques:1 ] and [ ques:2 ] , one would very likely have to understand the index of the order @xmath108 $ ] in @xmath553 .",
