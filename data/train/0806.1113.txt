    "one of the major uncertainties still surrounding particle acceleration around shocks is the level at which this saturates : , the total energy content in non - thermal particles , per unit volume , @xmath0 , in units of the incoming fluid kinetic energy density .",
    "this saturation level plays a very important role , for instance , in discussions of the origin of cosmic rays as observed at earth : it has to be rather large ( @xmath1 ) to allow sne to provide the observed flux .",
    "also , discussions on the origin of uhecrs are influenced by similar considerations : the idea that uhecrs are accelerated by grbs @xcite draws some measure of support by the coincidence between the energy release rate of grbs in @xmath2-ray photons and that required to account for observations at earth @xcite .",
    "it is certainly possible that this level of saturation is somehow connected with the very uncertain particle injection mechanism , and that saturation occurs , in many astrophysically important situations , at very low levels . yet , given the arguments concerning sne and grbs mentioned above , it appears that at least occasionally saturation must occur at rather large levels .",
    "this is especially so in the case of galactic cosmic rays : if in fact we were to discard sne as sources of cosmic rays , all other possible classes of sources , being both less numerous and less energetic , would force us to require saturation at even larger levels .",
    "a distinct possibility is that the saturation level is determined not by the injection mechanisms , but by modifications which the particles pressure induces in the shock properties .",
    "after all , in the test particle limit the particles spectrum is ultraviolet divergent ( though marginally so , of course ) , and one may hope that , since the particles back - reaction on the fluid makes acceleration less efficient ( by reducing the velocity jump around the gas sub - shock ) , a convergent spectrum will be obtained , with a definite value for the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "after @xcite s seminal papers @xcite , fully self - consistent solutions with particles pressure properly included have been obtained by @xcite . in these models",
    ", it appears that particles can carry away an arbitrarily large fraction of the incoming energy flux , for sufficiently large mach number at upstream infinity .",
    "even more intriguing is the fact that these solutions have particles spectra which are more , not less , ultraviolet divergent than those in the test particle limit . in fact , this divergence is arrested only by arbitrarily limiting the largest individual energy to some fiducial value @xcite .",
    "these solutions then seem to beckon for a stability analysis , in the hope that they are found to be unstable once @xmath3 exceeds some critical value .",
    "the instability we envision is of course the corrugational instability for shocks , whereby ripples on the shock surface become of larger and larger amplitude .",
    "if this instability were to exist , we might easily imagine that the shock is substituted by a region of strong fluid turbulence , where particles moving a few larmor radii perceive only a small velocity difference at the two ends of their free wandering , and thus acceleration to high energies is made somewhat less efficient .    however , it is well - known @xcite that shocks in polytropic fluids are stable against this kind of perturbations , and against the spontaneous emission of sound waves as well .",
    "the hope for the existence of an instability is based on a rather more subtle argument .",
    "when the shock surface flaps , it sheds in the downstream region pressure waves as well as entropy and vorticity perturbations .",
    "we will show later that the last two do not couple to particle perturbations , but pressure waves do , thus generating small perturbations in the particles distribution function , @xmath4 .",
    "these particles will however return upstream by means of diffusion , and here generate , by their sheer perturbed pressure , some more fluid perturbations .",
    "thus , not all energy shed by the shock is lost forever toward upstream infinity , as is the case in the purely hydrodynamical case , but some fraction of it returns to the shock to generate more flapping .",
    "in fact , since pressure waves are strongly damped by diffusion , and nearly all particles return to the upstream section since the shock is newtonian , we may conjecture that most energy shed by the shock flapping makes it back to feed more flapping , even though account must be taken of diffusion and phase mixing .",
    "is it possible that this sets up some strong reinforcement , making the whole system unstable ?",
    "this is the question we address in this paper .",
    "this question has of course been studied before , under somewhat different conditions .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of non - thermal particles by the fluid ( @xmath5 ) has been taken ( by other authors ) as independent of the particle impulse : this is conventionally referred to as the two - fluid approximation , because the boltzmann equation for the non - thermal particles can then easily be recast into an equation for their pressure , thusly erasing all references to the underlying distribution function .",
    "besides making the two - fluid approximation , @xcite also neglected diffusion altogether .",
    "a more complex analysis has been presented by @xcite , who included energy transport and particle injection at the shock , but still in the two - fluid approximation . in the following",
    ", we shall make no such approximations : we will consider a finite diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , and it will be allowed to be an arbitrary function of both @xmath7 , the particle momentum , and of @xmath8 , the local fluid density , so as to at least mimic the increase in magnetic field strength due to flux freezing . the arbitrary nature of the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 automatically prevents the use of the two - fluid approximation , and forces us to use the full boltzmann - skilling equation .",
    "a word of caution is in order about some assumptions .",
    "we will neglect all energy in the form of magnetic field and alfvn waves ; of course this is necessary because the zero - th order solutions of blasi and collaborators do not include these effects , but in our case this neglect requires one extra assumption , _ i.e. _ that the time scales for energy to accumulate into any of these energy sinks , @xmath9 , and to flow out of each of them , @xmath10 , be ordered like this : @xmath11 .",
    "if this inequality were severely violated , the magnetic field or alfvn waves might acquire a significant fraction of the total energy , despite their negligibility in the zero - th order solution , and make our treatment completely irrelevant .    in the following",
    ", we shall follow closely the treatment of the shock corrugational instability given by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall consider a steady - state shock in its own frame , located at @xmath12 , with fluid coming from the left , and exiting from the right , so that all speeds are @xmath13 .",
    "exactly like @xcite , we shall consider perturbations generated by the shock flapping , so that there can be no incoming waves , from either upstream or downstream infinity . in section",
    "[ sec : homog ] , we shall consider perturbations in a homogeneous medium ; this is perhaps a tad boring , but it contains a number of new results which are of the utmost importance later on . in section [ sec : pertup ] we briefly discuss perturbations upstream , _",
    "i.e. _ where the flow is inhomogeneous ; we show here that we can easily obtain the perturbations in the wkbj limit @xmath14 , which restricts our analysis to the regime @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the perturbation wavelength perpendicular to the shock , and @xmath17 is the typical size of the region of inhomogeneity upstream . in section [ sec : fitboundary ]",
    "we discuss the boundary conditions on the perturbed particle distribution function , and derive how it relates to the amplitude of the modes to which particle perturbations couple .",
    "we present in section [ sec : fluifcond ] the perturbed rankine ",
    "hugoniot conditions and in section [ sec : eigenf ] what fixes the global corrugation mode eigenfrequency . in section [ sec : results ] we present our numerical computations for the stability of the exact solutions of the zero - th order problem by @xcite . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we will compare our results with other works in the literature , and briefly summarize our work .",
    "we give here , for future reference , our basic equations .",
    "they are the conventional hydrodynamic equations : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 which contain a term for the momentum exchange between the fluid and the non - thermal particles represented by the gradient of the particle pressure @xmath21 , plus the usual boltzmann equation in @xcite : @xmath22 we assume @xmath23 to be a given function of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "we consider small - amplitude perturbations around a homogeneous solution where the particles are supposed to exert a non - negligible pressure .",
    "first , we consider entropy perturbations .",
    "perturbations can be taken in the form @xmath24 so to obtain , from the equation of entropy conservation , eq .",
    "[ entropycons ] , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unperturbed fluid velocity in the x - direction .",
    "perturbation of the mass conservation equation yields @xmath27 perturbation of the momentum equation yields @xmath28 now , the perturbation of the boltzmann equation yields @xmath29 which implies @xmath30 because , for entropy perturbations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as deduced above . furthermore , since @xmath33 , necessarily @xmath34 , and thus @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that entropy perturbations and particle perturbations are completely decoupled : in fact , entropy perturbations are just advected by the zero - th order flow .    in summary ,",
    "entropy perturbations have the following characteristics , where we define , for future convenience , @xmath36 : @xmath37 where the last equation applies to ideal fluids : @xmath38 is the average particle mass and @xmath39 boltzmann s constant .",
    "we turn now to isentropic perturbations , which automatically satisfy eq .",
    "[ entropycons ] .",
    "mass conservation implies @xmath40 while momentum conservation implies @xmath41 let us begin by assuming that the left - hand - side of eq.[mass1 ] vanishes ; the same is then true for @xmath42 . multiplying eq .",
    "[ momentum1 ] by @xmath43 , we see that @xmath44 , unless @xmath31 . if the curl vanishes , then so does @xmath45 , because any vector with vanishing divergence and curl is a constant , which can always be set to zero by a suitable choice of reference system .",
    "so we must have @xmath46 for perturbations with non - zero vorticity ; we thus find that @xmath47 , and then , again from eq .",
    "[ boltzpert ] , that @xmath48 , implying @xmath49 : vorticity perturbations do not couple to particles either .",
    "we have for them : @xmath50    we consider now those perturbations where @xmath51 does not vanish .",
    "we can show that here too there are two distinct classes of modes : in the first one , @xmath4 is not coupled to the fluid quantities , while in the second one it is through the term @xmath52 .",
    "the first class of modes , which we call _ d - mode _ , can not be obtained directly from eq .",
    "[ boltzpert ] , for reasons to be made clear shortly .",
    "we use instead the correct form @xmath53 where we dropped the term @xmath54 in keeping with our desire to find a solution totally uncoupled from the fluid .",
    "the solution of this equation is known from elementary courses : if @xmath55 is the initial distribution function at time @xmath56 ( possibly dependent upon @xmath7 ) , the solution at later times for @xmath57 is @xmath58 and the solution for @xmath59 is just @xmath60 . at the same time , we must make sure that this solution does not ruffle the fluid : this obviously requires @xmath61 at all times . now integrating eq .",
    "[ nonfourier ] over @xmath62 we find @xmath63 which clearly shows that , in order to have @xmath61 everywhere at all times we need @xmath64 everywhere at the initial time .",
    "if we now fourier - expand the initial condition @xmath65 with respect to @xmath66 , the above conditions become @xmath67 this completes the derivation of this purely damped d - mode , which will not perturb the fluid .",
    "though it may look at this stage like a mathematical oddity , this mode plays a key role in the matching of boundary conditions between the upstream and downstream regions .",
    "it is also worth remarking why it can not be derived from its fourier - analyzed counterpart : the solution in question contains a term @xmath68 , which does not have a fourier transform with respect to @xmath69 .    when @xmath70 , velocity perturbations @xmath71 are induced in the fluid by the non - vanishing particles pressure gradient , and eq .",
    "[ boltzpert ] can be solved for @xmath4 as @xmath72 if we integrate this over @xmath73 , we find @xmath74 where we assumed the non - thermal particles to have a minimum ( @xmath75 ) and a maximum ( @xmath76 ) momentum .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a weighted diffusion coefficient @xmath77 defined as follows : @xmath78 which shows @xmath79 to be a function of @xmath80 only .",
    "the above can be simplified a bit by integration by parts .",
    "if the integral were to extend from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , we would have @xmath83 where @xmath21 is the particle pressure in the unperturbed flow , and @xmath84 , the effective particle polytropic index , satisfies @xmath85 .",
    "since however the integral extends only from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , we define @xmath86    thus eq . [ deltapc1 ] can now be rewritten as : @xmath87    we remark that both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are obtained by weighing the zero - th order solution , so that they can be immediately computed as soon as this solution is available .",
    "we can now eliminate @xmath90 between eqs .",
    "[ mass1 ] and [ momentum1 ] , and then use @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 the sound speed because we are considering isentropic perturbations ) and the equation above to obtain @xmath93 where we have called @xmath94 the comoving eigenfrequency , in suitably scaled units .",
    ". [ reldisp ] , together with the definition of @xmath79 ( eq .",
    "[ dbar ] ) , is the sought - after dispersion relation for the coupled small perturbations in a homogeneous medium .",
    "the case where @xmath6 is independent of @xmath7 has been derived before @xcite and coincides with the above equation .",
    "surprisingly , the existence of this mode was not noticed by @xcite , even though a careful treatment of his equations yields precisely the same dispersion relation as above ; this neglect of this mode has important consequences to be discussed later on .",
    "it is best to begin our discussion with the case when @xmath6 , and thus @xmath79 , is a constant , independent of @xmath7 .",
    "[ reldisp ] then reduces to @xmath95 which is a simple polynomial equation of the third order . in this case",
    "two modes reduce to pressure waves , as is most easily seen in the test - particle regime @xmath96 .",
    "there is however a third solution which is only slightly more mysterious : in the test particle regime these modes represent a local over - density of particles dissipated by diffusion .",
    "when the test particle regime does not apply , a particle contribution to the sound speed is introduced by the term @xmath97 . this new mode ( which we call the _ third _ mode )",
    "is the equivalent of the d - mode when however the conditions [ justahelp ] are _ not _ satisfied : the basic idea is still the same , the particle overdensity is dissipated , but since the particle pressure does not vanish , the fluid is consequently ruffled .",
    "notice also that there are _ two _ third modes , traveling in opposite directions .",
    "the situation is slightly more complex when @xmath98 , because one must solve simultaneously eqs .",
    "[ reldisp ] and [ dbar ] .",
    "we begin by considering the limit @xmath99 . in this case , and assuming @xmath100 a constant , we easily find , to leading order in @xmath101 , @xmath102 : as it must , the dispersion relation allows pure pressure waves , with the particle pressure providing a correction to the ( pure gas ) sound speed , because for large perturbation wavelengths particles are entrained by the perturbation .",
    "we remark that , in this limit , pressure waves are _ supersonic _ , in the sense that they are faster than pressure waves propagating in a pure gas of the same thermodynamical state , a result already noticed by @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath100 a constant , we lost a solution , so we search for the third mode solution in the form @xmath103 higher order terms in @xmath101 .",
    "we find : @xmath104 now we use the definition @xmath105 to simplify the above to @xmath106 which can be now used with eqs .",
    "[ dbar ] and [ aux2 ] to obtain @xmath107 where of course @xmath108 . as a function of real @xmath80 , the right - hand side above ( where it exists )",
    "is easily seen to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath80 , vanishing for @xmath109 . in any realistic physical problem",
    "the integral must extend from a minimum ( @xmath75 ) to a maximum momentum @xmath76 ; since @xmath110 is expected to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 , we see that the integral above always exists for @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , and it diverges exactly at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "thus the integral on the right - hand side of the equation above spans the whole range from @xmath81 to @xmath115 as @xmath80 varies between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the range @xmath82 to @xmath81 as @xmath80 varies between @xmath117 and @xmath82 .",
    "somewhere in the range @xmath118 there is the one and only solution of the above equation .",
    "an illustration of the integral on the right - hand side of the previous equation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fz ] , for a specific distribution function from @xcite : the qualitative features of this plot are generic to all distribution functions we have tried .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath119 , and the small perturbations were assumed to vary as @xmath120 , the result that @xmath121 implies that all modes are damped by diffusion , as physical intuition obviously suggests .",
    "the discussion in the opposite limit , @xmath122 , is similar .",
    "if we assume @xmath100 a constant , we find the solution @xmath123 without the correction to the sound speed due to the presence of the particles pressure : in the limit @xmath122 particles escape by free streaming , and do not contribute to the sound speed .",
    "again , we lost a solution , so we now search for the third mode as @xmath124 lower order terms in @xmath101 .",
    "we obtain now : @xmath125 which can be rewritten as @xmath126 comparing this with eq .",
    "[ dbar ] , we see that the value of @xmath80 we are searching for is the one that makes the integral on the numerator of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ dbar ] diverge .",
    "following the previous discussion , we see that this is @xmath127 this is always positive , so that the solution is always damped by diffusion .",
    "this result has a simple physical explanation : when a small overdensity of particles is generated locally , the time - scale for damping of this overdensity is dictated by diffusion of the slowest particles .",
    "again for illustrative purposes , the real and imaginary parts of sonic and third modes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] for a specific distribution function from @xcite .",
    "again , the qualitative features are generic to all models we investigated .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that the introduction of particles modifies the modes of a homogeneous medium by adding two new modes , one coupled and one uncoupled to the fluid , both strongly damped by diffusion .    for future reference",
    ", we give the expressions for all small quantities , in units of @xmath128 : the link between @xmath128 and @xmath129 is obtained from eqs .",
    "[ dbar ] and [ aux2 ] , and the others follow easily . for later convenience",

    ", @xmath134 must be regarded as a known function of @xmath135 and @xmath136 , specified by eq .",
    "[ reldisp ] .      as a preparation for later work",
    ", we discuss the initial value problem .",
    "this has some interest because perturbations in @xmath137 belonging to the various modes are not mutually orthogonal , and thus it may appear that initial conditions , especially when given only in terms of @xmath51 , can not be decomposed into mutually independent modes . to fix ideas ,",
    "let us consider a homogeneous zero - th order solution where all fluid quantities are unperturbed , but a small perturbation @xmath138 at time @xmath139 is given : what are the amplitudes of the four modes that will be excited ( two pressure waves , the third mode , and the d - mode ) ?",
    "first of course we fourier - analyze @xmath140 , calling @xmath141 its amplitude .",
    "we must then have @xmath142 where we have introduced some notation that will be useful in the following : a summation convention over @xmath143 is understood , the @xmath144 s are the amplitudes of the pressure waves and third modes for @xmath145 , respectively ; @xmath146 is the amplitude of the d - mode , as in eq .",
    "[ justahelp ] , and the @xmath147 s are @xmath148 comparing this with eq .",
    "[ deltafattheshock ] , it becomes clear that the mode amplitudes @xmath149 s are simply @xmath150 .",
    "here the quantities @xmath151 are supposed to be linked by the appropriate branch of the dispersion relation . for @xmath146 to represent a proper d - mode , we know that it must satisfy the two constraints in eq . [ justahelp ]",
    "; thus we derive two conditions on the mode amplitudes : @xmath152 @xmath153 the last condition can be obtained by satisfying the requirement that the perturbations to both density and velocity vanish at the initial time . with reference to eq .",
    "[ homogeneoussolution ] , we see that the two conditions , the vanishing of the density and of the velocity , imply @xmath154 which are two more linear relations which , together with eqs .",
    "[ constr1 ] and [ constr2 ] , determine the @xmath149 s .",
    "this simple example illustrates the importance of the d - mode , a kind of elephants graveyard because , once particles join it , the perturbations they generate can only be dissipated away without ruffling the fluid ever again .",
    "it is useful to remark that , upstream , entropy perturbations are not allowed for arbitrarily dishomogeneous flows , while the same is not true for vorticity perturbations .",
    "in fact , the perturbation of the entropy equation is : @xmath155 where we could neglect the term @xmath156 because the fluid is isentropic in the unperturbed state . from the above",
    ", we see that entropy perturbations are advected by the background flow all the way from upstream infinity to the shock ; we can not however accept this , since in our problem all perturbations must have as a source the shock flapping .",
    "perturbations riding all the way from upstream infinity belong to perturbations in the boundary conditions , and are thus irrelevant . thus the perturbed fluid will be assumed adiabatic , from now on .",
    "the same argument does not apply to vorticity perturbations when the fluid is stratified , because they do couple to particle perturbations : in fact we easily obtain from eq .",
    "[ momentumcons ] that the equation for the vorticity , @xmath157 , is : @xmath158 in the absence of particles , this equation tells us that vorticity is exactly ( _ i.e. _ , not just to zero or first order ) lie - advected by the flow because , for adiabatic flows , @xmath159 .",
    "but in the presence of particles _ and _ of spatial gradients it is easily seen that the particle pressure @xmath21 acts as source of vorticity perturbations .    in order to make progress , we compute the spatial dependence of the various modes upstream in the wkbj approximation : _",
    "i.e. _ , in the limit @xmath160 , and in particular @xmath161 , the size of the upstream precursor . in other words",
    ", we take all perturbed physical quantities to be of the form @xmath162 and all derivatives in the @xmath163 direction ( , perpendicular to the shock ) are considered small when compared with terms proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "this is a perturbation analysis in which the transverse wavenumber @xmath136 is assumed large and as a consequence the longitudinal wavenumber @xmath164 is also large .",
    "the presence of a non - constant amplitude @xmath165 is equivalent to keeping the first two terms in an asymptotic expansion in the small parameter @xmath166 .",
    "this is often called the physical optics approximation @xcite .",
    "this analysis is quite standard , but the amusing thing is that we do nt even need to carry it through .",
    "in fact , we shall show later that the stability analysis requires knowledge of the physical quantities immediately before the shock , while knowledge of the perturbations run with @xmath163 further from the shock is immaterial .",
    "we see from the above that all physical quantities close to the shock satisfy @xmath167 this is precisely the same form that holds in the homogeneous medium , so that eqs .",
    "[ homogeneoussolution ] and [ justahelp ] still hold .",
    "also , the space - time dependence of the d - mode for the half - plane @xmath168 is derived in appendix [ app : dmode ] , assuming spatial homogeneity of the background solution ; and this , for the argument above , applies in the wkbj limit also to the upstream fluid .",
    "let us also remark that , in this spatially homogeneous limit , vorticity perturbations do not couple to particles : in other words , spatial gradients are negligibly small , and thus vorticity perturbations , which can only be lie - advected from upstream infinity , must vanish identically .",
    "this is the result we need : since we are using a wkbj approximation , we can treat the upstream fluid as if it were homogeneous , with the values for the physical quantities taken to be those immediately before the shock : we call this the homogeneous approximation : it clearly breaks down when the wkbj analysis does , which occurs for @xmath169 , the size of the upstream precursor .",
    "because of diffusion , particles are not restricted to the downstream part of the flow : there will be a @xmath170 also upstream , so that we need to consider appropriate conditions to match @xmath4 in the two regions .",
    "the first condition is obviously the continuity across the shock , @xmath171 it is also well - known that the spatial gradient of @xmath51 needs to satisfy a boundary condition at the shock : this is derived by integrating eq .",
    "[ boltzmann ] on an infinitesimal interval straddling the shock .",
    "the unit vector normal to the surface of the flapping shock is @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the shock corrugation amplitude .",

    "in fact , we know on the one hand that particles perturbations are not coupled to entropy and vorticity perturbations , while , on the other hand , we know that pressure and third modes , for given values of @xmath136 and @xmath135 , exist for opposite values of @xmath134 ( see eq .",
    "[ reldisp ] ) , and thus at least one pressure mode and one third mode will diverge exponentially toward infinity : this is unacceptable because we are studying flow instabilities , not variations in the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this discussion will be completed in section [ sec : eigenf ] .    on the upstream side",

    "we thus see that the conditions at the shock , plus knowledge of the modes , allows us to determine the amplitude of all modes ( except the vorticity and entropy modes downstream ) in terms of the amplitude of the pressure wave downstream . remembering eq .",
    "[ homogeneoussolution ] , we now see that all fluid quantities at the shock upstream are determined in terms of the amplitude of this very same wave ; as for the two d - modes , their explicit space- and time - dependence is not needed , but is given for completeness sake in appendix [ app : dmode ] .",

    "we follow closely the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , there were no perturbations on the upstream side of the shock : deviations from the unperturbed state were generated by the corrugation of the shock surface ( and its motion ) , and led to non - zero perturbations only downstream . in our problem , instead , the particles crossing the shock manage to generate new perturbations on the upstream side , leading to a slight modification to the rankine  hugoniot conditions . from now on , we indicate with the subscript 1 the quantities on the upstream side of the shock , and with the subscript 2 those on the downstream side . also , to make contact with @xcite work easier , we use as a variable @xmath197 rather than the density @xmath8 directly .",
    "we consider a small - amplitude corrugation of the shock surface , away from the @xmath198 plane , by a small displacement of the form : @xmath199 with respect to which the unit vectors parallel @xmath200 and normal @xmath201 to the surface have components in the @xmath202 plane : @xmath203 while the surface speed in the direction normal to the surface , with the respect to the reference frame of the unperturbed shock , is : @xmath204 all quantities are , of course , accurate to first order only .",
    "the first two rankine  hugoniot conditions to be perturbed involve the fluid speed , and they are the continuity of the fluid speed parallel to the shock surface , and the discontinuity of the perpendicular component in terms of perturbed",

    "89.1 ) : @xmath207 whose perturbation yields @xmath208 where we have defined @xmath209 while the ratio @xmath210 can be expressed as @xmath211 with @xmath212 the mach number of the upstream fluid .",

    "85.6 of @xcite recites : @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the mass flux . when the shock surface is perturbed , the above becomes @xmath215 the perturbation to first order of the above yields @xmath216",
    "lastly , the condition that @xmath4 be continuous across the shock has already been imposed , see eq .",
    "[ aux19 ] .",
    "we discuss here first how this problem differs from the one without particles , keeping in mind that we are interested in the stability of the shock flapping , so that all modes present must have this flapping as their source : we can not allow modes to come in from spatial infinity , because this amounts to perturbation of the boundary conditions , not of the shock geometry .",
    "when we can neglect the particles pressure , we know that there can be no perturbations upstream , since they are either generated at upstream infinity ( in which case we would not be treating the case of shock instability ) or , if generated at the shock , they can not propagate away from it fast enough ( the shock is supersonic ) . in the presence of particles",
    "the situation changes because particles can diffuse back to the upstream region , so that a perturbation @xmath51 generated downstream can return to upstream and perturb the fluid quantities .",
    "the situation is even more remarkable when one notices that , in this way , there can be a generation of pressure waves ( even though they are just sonic in a supersonic medium ) in the upstream region .",
    "the reason is shown in eq . [ momentumcons ] : the gradient in particles pressure is a source of perturbations , and since particles scatter a _ finite _ ( _ i.e. _ , non - zero ) distance from the shock , there is no obvious reason why even sonic perturbations should not be generated .",
    "the impossibility of having sonic perturbations in a supersonic medium arises only when the point of generation of the perturbations is the shock itself , not a finite distance from it .",
    "we must also remark that the presence of particles shuffling between downstream and upstream , and _ viceversa _ , has important consequences also for the kind of waves present downstream .",
    "in fact , while in the absence of particles the only waves present can be those shed by the shock , _",
    "i.e. _ entropy , vorticity and pressure disturbances propagating to downstream infinity , when particles are included in the picture we find , by complete analogy with the argument above for the upstream region , that they can seed the third mode and the d - mode .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : fitboundary ] that the amplitude of all modes ( and thus of all physical quantities ) upstream , and of the third mode downstream , can be expressed in terms of a single free parameter , the amplitude of pressure waves downstream . thus all amplitudes are fixed , except for three modes downstream ( entropy , vorticity , pressure ) and the shock displacement @xmath173 ; but we also have the four perturbed rankine ",
    "hugoniot conditions , which can be expressed in terms of these four quantities .",
    "the vanishing of determinant , once substitution of amplitudes for the upstream modes , and for the third mode downstream by means of the relations in section [ sec : fitboundary ] has been made , thus fixes the eigenfrequency .",
    "a word of caution is in order : we have tacitly assumed that the pressure wave propagating away from the shock in the downstream region is also the wave with the physically acceptable ( _ i.e. _ , decreasing ) behaviour at downstream infinity .",
    "this is not certain : in fact , even in the standard case with no particles , a proper mode exists when the mode explodes exponentially in time _ and _ the pressure wave propagating away from the shock dies down at downstream infinity @xcite .",
    "this condition can only be checked _ a posteriori _ , _ i.e. _ after having found numerically the value of @xmath135 .",

    "in essence , our method is exact , except for the short - wavelength ( wkbj ) approximation necessary to treat analytically perturbations in the inhomogeneous upstream precursor .",
    "one may however wonder where our method differs from previous work @xcite , which has reported the existence of corrugational instabilities .",
    "@xcite have reported the existence of both genuine corrugational instabilities , and of spontaneous emission of sound waves , for some ( not all ) of their models .",
    "there is of course a number of differences between this paper and theirs : we do not use the two - fluid approximations , and are interested in small - wavelength perturbations , contrary to them ; we also notice the existence of perturbations in the upstream fluid , which they do not discuss .",
    "@xcite included a number of novelties in his treatment , but he too did not notice that particles would diffuse upstream , so that he neglects the third and the d - modes altogether . despite this , he does have perturbations upstream ( pressure waves ! ) , because he remarks that , for sufficiently long - wavelength perturbations , these become supersonic with respect to the fluid alone . this occurs because particles and fluid are tightly coupled in long wavelength perturbations by diffusion , which traps non - thermal particles , so that the restoring pressure is the sum of particles and fluid s pressures , which is larger than the pure fluid speed .",
    "this is of course correct , and exists in our computations as well .",
    "contrary to these authors , we have found that shocks with non  vanishing particle pressure are stable to corrugational instabilities , even in the region of parameter space where multiple solutions are possible .",
    "we believe that the reason for this discrepancy lies in our inclusion of diffusion , and the abandonement of the two - fluid approach , as we now argue .",
    "we stated in the introduction that the only possibility for the shock destabilization ( polytropic shocks without particles are well  known to be corrugationally stable ) lies in setting up a loop whereby perturbations shed by the shock in the downstream region return to the upstream region via particle diffusion and excite more perturbations ; thus perturbation energy is not lost to downstream infinity , but returns to the shock to create more havoc .",
    "however , the very same mechanism that brings particles back upstream , also causes perturbations dampening : we have seen that diffusion leads to damping both pressure waves and the so  called third modes .",
    "also , we have established that a part of the perturbation occurs in the @xmath276mode ( where @xmath276 stands for damping ) , where particles are perturbed in phase ",
    "space , but the total perturbation to the pressure vanishes .",
    "thus , some fraction of the perturbation goes into a totally useless form ( the @xmath276mode ) , the new mode ( the third mode ) is always damped , and even pressure waves acquire a damping which is altogether neglected in the two  fluid approximation . in the end , while diffusion brings particles ( and perturbations ) back to the shock , the simultaneous damping is so strong to make the excitation of an instability ineffective .",
    "we should remark that damping of pressure waves is weakest for the largest wavelengths , a limit which is unaccessible to us because of our wkbj approximation , but is exactly the limit investigated by @xcite . while we have not found a large wavelength",
    "beyond which the shock becomes unstable , we can not exclude that a proper treatment of the perturbations in the space ",
    "dependent precursor may yield a transition to the unstable regime .",
    "a further comment is in order : of all possible geometries , the planar one is probably the least likely to display instability .",
    "consider in fact a spherically symmetric explosion like a supernova . in this case , the perturbations ( except of course for entropy and vorticity ) generated downstream do not escape to infinity , as they do in the planar case , but return to the shock because the downstream region is finite and because they are deflected by a spatially - dependent refraction index ; once they reach the shock , they may generate further perturbations .",
    "the situation is even more promising when the shock is due to an accretion flow , or is stalling : in fact , except for the presence of particles , this is exactly the scenario proposed ( see @xcite for an analytic approach and discussion ) for the generation of asymmetries in proto - neutron stars : in this case , the mechanism for the instability of a stalled accretion shock is the reflection by the hard star surface into outgoing pressure waves of advected entropy perturbations , which return to the shock to generate more mischief . in the problem with particles ,",
    "there is the extra complication due to diffusion , to be overcome to generate instability .",
    "given the relative complexity of even a pure fluid analysis @xcite , it is likely that this problem will require a numerical approach .",

    "<S> we then show how to construct a corrugational mode for the shock itself , one , that is , where the shock executes free oscillations ( possibly damped or growing ) and sheds perturbations away from itself : this global mode requires the new modes . </S>",
    "<S> then , using the perturbed rankine  hugoniot conditions , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this leads to the determination of the corrugational eigenfrequency . </S>",
    "<S> we solve numerically the equations for the eigenfrequency in the wkbj regime for the models of @xcite , showing that they are stable . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the differences between our treatment and previous work . </S>"
