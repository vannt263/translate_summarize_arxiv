    "measurements of parity non - conservation in neutron capture by th nucleus @xcite gave a surprising result : in spite of a natural assumption of a random character of matrix elements of the weak interaction between compound states , the effect was found to be of the same sign for all observed resonances .",
    "possibly , this means that the strongly fluctuating matrix elements of a weak perturbation between `` chaotic '' states of a compound nucleus ( which was , in fact , the first example of quantum chaotic system ) are essentially correlated .",
    "thus , the problem of correlations between components of compound states is of great importance both for theory and applications .",
    "an attempt to study these correlations has been undertaken in @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that some correlations may appear if the number of independent parameters in a hamiltonian matrix is substantially smaller that the total number of the hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "the simplest example is given by the model of a random separable interaction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the unperturbed energies and @xmath2 are random variables distributed , e.g. , according to a gaussian law .",
    "as one can see , the number of independent parameters @xmath2 is equal to @xmath3 , while the number of the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown that this model displays very strong ( @xmath6 ) correlations between eigenvectors with close energies , despite the random character of the interaction : @xmath7 .",
    "such correlations can not appear in models described by full random matrices , like those of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "it was always obvious that such models possess some unphysical features , e.g. , the semicircle level density , however , they seem to give a very accurate description of the correlations and fluctuations of energy levels ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the important point is that in real many - body systems the basic interaction is a two - body one .",
    "this means that the number of independent parameters determining the @xmath8-particle hamiltonian ( two - body matrix elements ) is much smaller than the number of the hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "taking the two - body matrix elements as gaussian random variables , a model called the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) was introduced in @xcite ( see also references in @xcite ) .",
    "this model looks in principle much more realistic than the goe . in particular",
    ", it has a gaussian form of the level density , which is in good agreement with various nuclear shell - model calculations for `` realistic '' interactions in the finite basis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the tbre does not allow a deep analytical treatment , however , numerical modeling showed that its level fluctuation properties are very close to those of the goe , although some differences were noticed @xcite .",
    "therefore , in some respect , the two - body nature of the particle interaction does not reveal itself in the level statistics .",
    "in other words , level fluctuations are insensitive to the details of the interaction between particles , provided the latter is large enough to cause strong mixing of the basis states .    another model which seems to be more physical",
    "then the goe was proposed a while ago by wigner @xcite to describe compound nuclei .",
    "it was suggested that the hamiltonian matrix @xmath9 has a banded structure , i.e. , all matrix elements with @xmath10 are zeros ( @xmath11 is the bandwidth ) .",
    "the matrix elements inside the band are random numbers with zero mean and fixed variance , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , except those on the main diagonal , which monotonically increase , @xmath14 . in this model",
    "all eigenstates are localized in the unperturbed basis ( @xmath15 ) . in the non - perturbative regime , @xmath16 the strength function which describes the localization in the energy space ( also called the local spectral density of states ) , has a characteristic breit - wigner form with a width @xmath17 within the band .",
    "this shape is in agreement with nuclear data @xcite , and with the calculated localization properties of chaotic eigenstates in the rare - earth atom of ce @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown in @xcite that the hamiltonian matrix which produces the dense spectrum of atomic excited states in ce , is sparse and has a band - like structure , although the edges of the band are diffuse .",
    "we should also mention that a number of analytical results on the localization properties of such band random matrices ( brm ) has been recently obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements in this brm model are independent random variables , thus this model is void of any possible correlations related to the two - body interaction between particles .    in this paper we show that there are quantities ( transition amplitudes , or transition strengths ) for which the underlying two - body interaction is of crucial importance .",
    "we show that the such interaction gives rise to specific correlations between the components of eigenstates , which are very essential for the distribution of transition strengths .",
    "our results are obtained in the framework of the two - body random interaction model ( tbrim ) recently proposed in @xcite for the study of various physical problems related to such complex many - body systems as heavy atoms , nuclei , metallic clusters , etc . , which display quantum chaotic behaviour .",
    "being in some aspects similar to the tbre , the tbrim is simpler in the sense that it abandons all restrictions imposed by the conservation of the angular momentum which makes it closer to the embedded goe @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - degenerate spectrum of the single - particle orbitals the tbrim is based upon , generates a realistic level density and leads to a band - like structure of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "we should mention that there was quite a number of earlier works where strength distributions were studied using statistical spectroscopy methods and nuclear shell - model calculations ( @xcite , see also review @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are based on the calculation of distribution moments , which are given by traces of products of the operators in question and powers of the hamiltonian over the model finite - dimensional space of the problem .",
    "since the calculation of traces does not require knowledge of eigenstates , the question of correlations within eigenstates which is of prime importance for the present work , has not been addressed in those studies .",
    "we must add that statistical spectroscopy methods emphasize and employ a particular importance of gaussian spreading of many - particle configurations , and features like breit - wigner localization either do not appear , or are neglected ( together with the interaction between configurations ) in that formalism .",
    "all in all , it is unfortunately very difficult for the present approach to make contact with those results .",
    "comparing the two approaches we should say that at first sight ours does not look as rigorous and mathematically advanced as the other one , as it appeals to some heuristic arguments and uses rather simple mathematics , e.g. , perturbation theory .",
    "however , we believe that supported by numerical experiments , our method can give a deeper insight and a more physical picture of transitions between and correlations within the chaotic eigenstates in complex many - body systems .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we show how the basic two - body interaction results in the correlations between the hamiltonian matrix elements , eigenstate components and transition amplitudes . in sec .",
    "3 we check , whether the effects found in sec .",
    "2 could lead to some correlations between transition amplitudes coupling different pairs of states .",
    "section 4 presents a brief outline of a statistical approach to the calculation of transition strengths ; the analytical results are checked there against numerical ones obtained in the tbrim . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we study the spreading widths of the many - particle basis states .",
    "let us consider the basic ideas of the tbrim . in this model , @xmath8 fermi - particles are distributed among @xmath18 non - degenerate orbitals . in doing numerical experiments , we assume , as in @xcite , that the energies of the orbitals are given by the simple expression : @xmath19 however",
    ", the analytical treatment presented below does not depend on a particular form of @xmath20 .",
    "many - particle basis states @xmath21 are constructed by specifying the @xmath8 occupied orbitals .",
    "the energy @xmath22 of the basis state equals the sum of the single - particle energies over the occupied orbitals .",
    "the total number of the many - particle states in the model is @xmath23 .",
    "the latter estimate relates to large @xmath18 and @xmath8 and shows that @xmath3 is exponentially large for @xmath24 .",
    "the number of independent parameters of the many - body hamiltonian is given by the number of different two - body interaction matrix elements @xmath25 and equals @xmath26 . due to the two - body character of the interaction , the hamiltonian matrix element @xmath27 is non - zero only when @xmath21 and @xmath28 differ by no more than two occupied single - particle orbitals . as a result",
    ", the number @xmath29 of the non - zero matrix elements @xmath9 is given by @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the numbers of the hamiltonian matrix elements coupling a particular basis state @xmath35 to another one , @xmath36 , which differs form @xmath35 by the positions of none , one and two particles , respectively .",
    "therefore , for @xmath24 we have @xmath37 , i.e. , the hamiltonian matrix is essentially sparse and , in a sense , strongly correlated .    to see the correlation between non - zero matrix elements ,",
    "let us consider a pair of basis states @xmath21 and @xmath28 which differ by the states of two particles , for example , the state @xmath28 can be obtained from the state @xmath21 by transferring the particles from the orbitals @xmath38 into the orbitals @xmath39 . for all such pairs ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix elements are the same , @xmath40 ( or , strictly speaking , @xmath41 , due to fermi statistics ) .",
    "it is easy to calculate the total number @xmath42 of the matrix elements @xmath9 equal to @xmath25 , using the fact that the remaining @xmath43 particles can be arbitrary distributed over @xmath44 orbitals , @xmath45 for basis states @xmath21 and @xmath28 which differ by the state of one particle @xmath46 the matrix element @xmath9 equals the sum of the @xmath47 two - body interaction matrix elements , @xmath48 ( the index @xmath49 runs over the rest @xmath47 occupied orbitals ) . in this case @xmath9 for different @xmath50 and @xmath28 ( with fixed @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) do not coincide , but may contain identical terms @xmath53 , i.e. , they are also correlated .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath54 of the model are determined by their components @xmath55 with respect to the many - particle basis states @xmath56 , @xmath57 and can be found by solving the schrdinger equation , @xmath58 if the perturbation @xmath59 is strong enough , the exact eigenstates @xmath60 are superpositions of a large number of basis states . as is known , strong mixing of basis states in the exact eigenstates ( compound states ) occurs locally within some energy range , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is known as the `` spreading width '' .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the local mean level spacing for many - particle states and @xmath65 is effective number of basis states represented in a compound state .",
    "this number is also known as the number of `` principal components '' .",
    "these components give the main contribution to the normalization condition @xmath66 for the eigenstate @xmath54 .",
    "formally , we can estimate @xmath65 as the reciprocal of the inverse participation ratio , @xmath67 .",
    "it is rather straightforward to show that the correlations between @xmath9 result in correlations between the components @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , let us multiply the schrdinger equation by the coefficient @xmath55 and sum over @xmath68 . using the orthogonality condition @xmath69 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath70 in what follows , we assume that the matrix elements of the two - body interaction @xmath59 are random variables with the zero mean , therefore , @xmath71 for @xmath72 . in this case one can get @xmath73 where the line stands for averaging over different realizations of @xmath59 . however , if matrix elements of the hamiltonian are correlated , @xmath74 , the components of different eigenvectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 are also correlated , since @xmath77 the latter relation shows that @xmath78 .",
    "the above conclusion has important consequences .",
    "let us consider a single - particle operator @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "it is convenient to express the matrix elements of @xmath82 in terms of matrix elements of the density matrix operator @xmath83 which transfers a particle from the orbital @xmath52 to the orbital @xmath84 .",
    "one can see that the matrix element of @xmath82 between compound states,@xmath85 @xmath86 has the zero mean due to the statistical properties of the components , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "since the summation over the orbitals @xmath88 in eq.([n1n2 ] ) is independent from the averaging over different realizations of @xmath59 , in what follows we consider the simplest case of @xmath89 .",
    "the variance of the matrix element of @xmath90 between the two compound states is equal to @xmath91 where we separated the diagonal and non - diagonal contributions to the sum ( [ m2 ] ) , @xmath92 @xmath93 note that the diagonal term @xmath94 is essentially positive and can be easily estimated ( see @xcite and sec . 4 below ) , while the non - diagonal term @xmath95 is of our main interest .",
    "if the eigenstates are completely `` random '' ( different components both inside each eigenstate and of different eigenstates are uncorrelated ) , the correlation sum @xmath96 is equal to zero and the variance is determined by the `` diagonal '' sum @xmath97 ( this assumption have been used in the previous calculations of matrix elements between compound states in @xcite ) . however",
    ", we show below that in many - body system these two terms are of the same order , @xmath98 , even for the random two - body interaction @xmath59 .",
    "the tbrim allows one to investigate various properties of chaotic many - body systems taking into account the two - body nature of the interaction between particles . in the previous papers @xcite",
    "there were indications that the diagonal approximation is not completely accurate for the computation of the variance of matrix elements of perturbation . in order to study this effect in detail",
    ", we have performed numerical experiments with tbrim for the parameters corresponding to the model calculations of the ce atom @xcite .",

    "accordingly , the index @xmath35 runs over those states in which @xmath51 is occupied and @xmath52 is vacant . for such @xmath35 and @xmath109",
    "the matrix element @xmath110 , otherwise , it is zero .",
    "therefore , in fact , the sum in ( [ sd ] ) is a single sum , with a number of items less than @xmath3 , @xmath111 where the sum @xmath112 runs over the specified @xmath35 .",

    "one can expect that maximal values of the sum ( [ ssd ] ) and , possibly , ( [ ssc ] ) are achieved when @xmath117 s are principal components of the eigenstates .",
    "this means that mean square of the matrix element @xmath118 is maximal when the operator @xmath90 couples the principal components of the state @xmath54 with those of @xmath119 , i.e. for @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "far from the maximum ( @xmath122 ) a principal component of one state , say , @xmath68 , is coupled to a small component @xmath106 of the other state @xmath123 ( @xmath124 . the latter case is simpler to consider analytically , since the admixture of a small component in the eigenstate can be found by means of perturbation theory .",

    "in section 4 when considering the statistical approach to the calculation of the variance of matrix elements between compound states , it was assumed that the spreading widths @xmath62 are the same for all basis components .",
    "however , this question is not trivial .",
    "as is discussed in the literature , the spreading widths of components corresponding to different number of excited particles could have significantly different values .",

    "we should note that the r.m.s .",
    "spreading width is different from that introduced intuitively in sec .",

    "spreading width is determined by the bandwidth @xmath11 as @xmath316 , whereas the `` breit - wigner spreading width '' is @xmath317 ( see introduction ) . however , in a more realistic situation the strength function drops rapidly , its second moment is finite , and the difference between the r.m.s . @xmath62 and @xmath318 is not large .    from figure 9",
    "one can see that apart from small natural fluctuations , the r.m.s .",
    "spreading width is the same for all components . to exclude a weak dependence of @xmath302 on the energy of the basis state @xmath36 ( boundary effects seen as rises of @xmath302 at small and large @xmath36 ) , we calculate the mean value @xmath319 and the r.m.s deviation @xmath320 of the spreading width by averaging over @xmath32150874 .",
    "the results are : @xmath322 , @xmath323 .",
    "the latter value shows that the fluctuations of the width are very small .",
    "this result is in agreement with computations made for the ce atom @xcite ; similar results have been recently obtained in the nuclear @xmath324-shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the width are small due to the large number of `` decay channels '' for each basis component ( each component is coupled to many others by random interaction ) @xcite .",
    "formally , this can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the tbrim one obtains @xmath325 which shows that for large number of `` independent decay channels '' , @xmath326 [ see eq .",
    "( [ k123 ] ) ] the statistics of @xmath302 is given by the @xmath327 distribution with @xmath328 degrees of freedom , resulting in the @xmath329 decrease of fluctuations .",
    "more accurately , the relative r.m.s . fluctuation of the squared width ( [ gamma ] ) is given by @xmath330 .",
    "for @xmath304 , @xmath305 eq .",
    "( [ gamran ] ) yields @xmath331 , and the relative fluctuation is 0.07 .",
    "these values are close to the numerical ones quoted above ( the discrepancy is mainly due to the difference between the mean width and its r.m.s .",
    "value , and the corresponding difference in the fluctuations of @xmath302 and @xmath332 ) .    to check the independence of @xmath302 of the number of excited particles in the component @xmath36",
    ", we have calculated the average spreading width @xmath333 for basis states with a fixed number of excited particles @xmath334 , @xmath335 . in the numerical experiment shown in fig .",
    "6 all @xmath333 for @xmath33615 proved to be approximately the same , @xmath337 .",
    "the above consideration shows that the statistical approach does not provide any support for the dependence of the spreading width on the number of excited particles .",
    "this indicates that the argumentation in favour of a strong dependence , based on different decay phase volumes for different numbers of excited particles , seems to be incorrect . in our opinion , the difference in the spreading widths could appear as a result of specific dynamical effects .",
    "for example , this could be an influence of levels in other potential wells which appear at higher nuclear deformation , or due to an interaction with collective motions , such as rotations and vibrations .",
    "the calculation of the mean square matrix element of an operator between compound states of a many - body system has been considered .",
    "we have shown that the two - body nature of the interaction between particles manifests itself in the existence of correlations between the components of the `` chaotic '' compound eigenstates .",
    "these correlations taken together with the correlations between the many - particle hamiltonian matrix elements result in a relatively large correlation contribution to the mean square matrix element .",
    "the correlations exist even if the two - body matrix elements are independent random variables , as in the tbrim . such correlations can be understood in terms of the perturbative mixing of the distant small components to the principal components of the eigenstates .",
    "if the hamiltonian matrix elements are random variables the correlations of this type vanish .    one of the most interesting feature of the correlations found in our work is that they do not decrease with the increase of the number of excited particles or active orbitals .",
    "thus , they must be taken into account when calculating matrix elements of a weak interaction between compound states in nuclei .",
    "another feature concerns the shape of the distribution of the density matrix operator near its maximum .",
    "as one can see from figs .",
    "1a,2a , the correlations create a sharp spikelike form of the distribution , instead of a smooth gaussian or breit - wigner form . with such sharp peaks , the strength function for any particular operator",
    "@xmath82 can have the so - called gross - structure , due to many single particle transition terms in the expression ( [ mrho ] ) . without these specific correlations ,",
    "the strength function would be much smoother and the gross - structure would not be seen .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there are very large mesoscopic - type fluctuations in the distribution near the maximum , depending on a specific ( random ) realization of the two - body interaction @xmath59 .",
    "this fact is also the consequence of strong correlations .",
    "our study also demonstrated that the spreading widths of different basis components are approximately constant and fluctuate very weakly .",
    "in particular , we have not found any dependence on the number of excited particles in the component .",
    "the statistical approach to the calculations of such matrix elements has been tested in the present work with the help of the tbrim .",
    "the numerical results obtained in this work support the validity of the statistical approach .",
    "the tbrim has also enabled us to check that the matrix elements of different transition operators between a pair of compound states are uncorrelated , as are the matrix elements of a given operator between different pairs of compound states .",

    "<S> surprisingly , these correlations increase with the increase of the number of active ( valence ) particles . statistical theory of transition amplitudes between compound states , which takes into account these correlation is developed and tested within the framework of the two - body random interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that a feature , which can be called `` correlation resonance '' , appears in the distribution of the transition matrix amplitudes , since the correlations strongly reduce the transition amplitudes at the tails and increase them near the maximum of the distribution .    </S>",
