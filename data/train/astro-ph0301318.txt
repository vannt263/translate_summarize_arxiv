    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) duration has a bimodal distribution ( mazets et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , norris et al . ( 1984 ) ; hurley ( 1992 ) ; kouveliotou et al . ( 1993 ) ) .",
    "this indicates the existence of two distinct morphological classes of events , namely short - duration ( @xmath0 2 s ) bursts and long - duration ( @xmath1 2 s ) bursts .",
    "approximately 20 per cent of the observed bursts are short .",
    "their energy spectra are usually harder than the spectra of long bursts ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 )",
    ".    searches for the optical and radio afterglow of short grbs have been carried out in only a few cases .",
    "four grbs were localized with high accuracy by the interplanetary network ( ipn ) ( hurley et al . 2002 ) .",
    "nighther optical nor radio afterglow emission was detected for these four events .",
    "no x - ray counterparts have been detected so far for the short bursts localized by beppo - sax ( gandolfi et al .",
    "2000 ) or by hete-2 ( lamb et al .",
    "the rapid follow - up observations have resulted in only upper limits on the brightness of the afterglows from these grbs .    at the same time",
    "early x - ray and gamma - ray afterglows of short bursts were detected in a bumber cases by the grb detectors themselves , in time intervals from seconds to tens of seconds after the trigger .",
    "batse observations showed that such a weak afterglow exists for some of the short bursts , lasting several tens seconds ( burenin , 2000 ; lazatti et al .",
    "2001 ; connaughton , 2002 ) .",
    "the afterglows of short grbs were also detected by the konus - wind experiment .",
    "post  burst emission in the energy range below 1 mev is seen for about 10 per cent of events .",
    "the statistical analysis of the whole konus  wind and konus  a short burst sample reveals that the afterglow is a more common feature of short grbs .",
    "the early afterglows of short grbs are observed for 11 short bursts , i.e. grb 9511014a , 980605 , 980706a , 981107 , 990313 , 990327 , 990516 , 990712a , 000218 , 000701b , and 000727 .",
    "these afterglows appear in time intervals from several seconds up to 100 seconds after the trigger .",
    "a limited volume of this proceeding does nt allow us to present all illustrations .",
    "one can find lightcurves and spectra of these events as well as fluence , peak flux , and spectral parameters tables in the `` konus catalog of short grbs '' ( mazets et al .",
    "the electronic version of the catalog is available at http://www.ioffe.ru / lea / shortgrbs / catalog/. let us look now at a typical example .",
    "figure 1 presents on the left pannel light curves of grb990712a ( ut 27915.510 s ) in three energy windows : 10 - 50 , 50 - 200 , and 200 - 750 kev . on the right pannel",
    "there is the light curve of postburst emission for combined 10 - 750 kev energy range .",
    "an emission is seen up to 150 seconds after the burst trigger on the level up to @xmath2 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 compared to @xmath5 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 for the main event .",
    "most of the considered events are typical short grbs with hard spectrum . on the left pannel of figure 2 an energetic spectrum of grb990712a",
    "solid line is a best fit by comp model with @xmath6 and @xmath7kev .",
    "the spectral composition of the post burst emission ( right pannel ) generally fits to power law with indicies in the 1.32.5 range .",
    "[ t ! ]    [ b ! ]",
    "while other events do nt exhibit such `` visual '' evidences , very stable radiation background conditions of the konus - wind experiment allow us to perform search of post  burst emission on the summed up lightcurves of short grbs not included in the discussed set .    for this analysis we used `` background mode '' 50750 kev data sampled with bins of 2.944 s. for the summed - up lightcurves of 100 events a post  burst emission at the level of 1.5@xmath80.4 counts s@xmath4burst@xmath4 was found in 5100 s interval after the grb . taking in consideration an effective area of konus - wind detector",
    "this magnitude is comparable with ( connaughton , 2002 ) .",
    "another interesting characteristic is a `` normalized afterglow flux ''",
    "fa / fb , i.e. a countrate divided by a `` grb bin '' countrate . in figure 3 ( left pannel )",
    "fa / fb is plotted versus time after the trigger for the sums of 20 and 60 strongest events . on the right pannel",
    "this characteristic is plotted versus peak burst count rate for 90 events gruped by 10 .",
    "one can see that the magnitude of relative afterlow emission remains on the comparable level for groups of different intensity grbs , being limited only by statistcs for weaker events .",
    "it leads us to a conclusion that an afterglow is a more common feature of short grbs .",
