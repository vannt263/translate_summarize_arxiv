    "some attempts have been made to obtain information about the mass of the lens from observed microlensing events .",
    "unfortunately , the mass can not be inferred directly . instead , the only relevant information directly available from a fit of a light curve to the observed data points is the timescale @xmath0 , and the mass depends on this timescale ( @xmath1 ) as well as on the position of the lens and the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line - of - sight . since the latter parameters are both not observable ( except for extraordinary cases where some additional information can be obtained ) , one can only obtain statistical information on the lens mass assuming distributions of the lens position and the transverse lens velocity .",
    "griest ( @xcite ) , cited as gri in the following , argued that the most likely mass distribution is that which yields the best fit to the distribution of timescales of the observed events .",
    "de rjula et al .  ( @xcite ) , cited as rjm in the following , jetzer & mass ( @xcite ) and jetzer ( @xcite ) have shown that one can extract statistical moments of the lens mass distribution from the moments of the distribution of the timescales .    while these attempts use the distribution of timescales to obtain information about the mass spectrum of the lenses as realized in nature , i will discuss another topic in this paper . for a given observed event ,",
    "i investigate the probability distributions of the lens mass and other physical quantities like the einstein radius and the separation and rotation period of the lens objects for a binary lens .",
    "these probability distributions give the answer to the question , how probable certain ranges of the considered physical quantity are for the given lens system having produced the event . note that this question is not answered by applying the methods of gri or rjm .",
    "it is however of special importance for planetary systems .",
    "also note that additional parameters will enter the calculation of the event rate if one considers events which deviate from the point - source - point - mass - lens model .",
    "a binary lens will give serious problems for determining the mass spectrum from the timescale distribution since one measures the agglomeration of two objects each from the mass spectrum for one event rather than a single object from the mass spectrum .",
    "in contrast to this , the probability distributions presented in this paper also give meaningful results for ` anomalous ' events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , it is shown which information directly results from a fit of a galactic microlensing light curve . in sect .  3 , the relation between the event rate and the mass spectrum , the spatial distribution of the lenses , and the distribution of the relative velocity is given .",
    "section  4 shows how the probability distribution for the lens mass can be derived .",
    "section  5 gives results for the moments of further physical quantities and the probability distribution of these quantities around their expectation value . in sect .",
    "6 , it is shown that the expectation value for the mass coincides with the value obtained by applying the mass moment method of rjm to one event . in sect .",
    "7 , two special forms of the velocity distribution are discussed in more detail : a maxwellian distribution and a fixed velocity . in sect .",
    "8 , the expectation values and the probability distributions for the lens mass , the einstein radius , and the separation and the rotation period for binary lenses are shown for a simple model of the galactic halo .",
    "in addition , intervals corresponding to probabilites of 68.3  % and 95.4  % are given for these quantities . in sect .",

    "i discuss what information can be extracted and how the observation of more events influences the results .",
    "from a fit of the light curve to the observed data of a galactic microlensing event , the only dimensional parameters are the point of time @xmath2 when the event occurs and the characteristic timescale @xmath0 related to its duration . while the point of time @xmath2 does not yield any relevant information , all physical quantities related to the observed event which involve a dimension depend on @xmath0 .",
    "this is true not only for the ` standard model ' of galactic microlensing  a point - mass lens and a point source  , but also for ` anomalous ' events ( binary sources and lenses , parallax effects , blending , finite size of the source and the lens ) .",
    "the geometry of the microlensing events depends on a length scale which can be chosen as the einstein radius @xmath3 of the lens of mass @xmath4 at a distance @xmath5 from the observer , where the source is at a distance @xmath6 from the observer and at a distance @xmath7 from the lens .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath3 is then given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath3 can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 the characteristic time scale @xmath0 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line - of - sight source - observer . note that motions of the source and the observer are also absorbed into this quantity .",
    "for a given @xmath0 , the mass @xmath15 therefore follows as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a characteristic velocity and @xmath18 .",
    "one sees that @xmath15 depends on the timescale @xmath0 as well as on @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by assuming distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( where the distribution of @xmath20 may depend on @xmath19 )",

    "@xcite ) and that eros#1 involves an emission line be type star ( beaulieu et al .",

    "are shown ( dominik & hirshfeld @xcite ; dominik @xcite ) .",

    "the parametrization used is that of dominik & hirshfeld ( @xcite ) : @xmath243 denotes the projected half - distance between the lens objects in the lens plane , where @xmath244 , @xmath227 denotes the mass fraction in lens object 1 .",

    "the model ba3 has previously been omitted ( dominik & hirshfeld @xcite ) due to the fact that the mass ratio between the lens objects is very extreme ( @xmath257 ) , which corresponds to unphysical values ( see table  [ estvalsbin ] ) . however , the uncertainty of the mass ratio is very large for extreme mass ratios ( dominik & hirshfeld @xcite ) due to the fact that the lens behaves nearly like a chang - refsdal lens .",
    "the same degenaracy has recently been rediscovered in the context of lensing by a star with a planet by gaudi & gould ( @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ estvalsbin2 ] shows the estimates for the 4 wide binary lens models ( ba , ba1 , ba2 , ba3 ) where fit parameters at the upper @xmath258-@xmath259-bounds of the mass ratio @xmath179 have been used .",
    "it can be seen that the expectation values for the separation and the mass change dramatically for the fits with small values of @xmath179 , leaving much room for speculations about the nature of the lens object .",
    "recently , rhie & bennett ( @xcite ) have speculated about a planetary companion in the macho lmc#1 event .",
    "however , as shown in this and the last section , there are two fundamental uncertainties ( beyond the fact that there are only a few data points near the peak , which could have been solved by a denser sampling ) , namely the uncertainty in the mass ratio and the uncertainty due to the unknown lens position and its velocity .",
    "the planetary model of rhie & bennett ( @xcite ) corresponds to my model ba1 , where the expectation value of the mass of the low - mass object is about @xmath260 .",
    "taking into account an uncertainty of a factor of 30 , a value of 2  jupiter masses is reached just at the @xmath258-@xmath259-bound . as shown in table  [ estvalsbin ] ,",
    "the expectation value for the mass of the low - mass object is about the same for all of my wide binary lens fits , so that there are the same prospects for a planet as the low - mass object for all of these models .",
    "however , the high - mass object will be different .",
    "the estimates of physical quantities like the mass of the lens object(s ) , their separation and the rotation periods along with the uncertainties involved are needed to reveal the physical nature of the lens for each observed event .",
    "one can check whether the mass range is consistent with the assumption of a dark object , and of which nature the lens should be in this case ( brown dwarf , white dwarf , neutron star ,  ) . the determination of the mass range is crucial for claiming the existence of a planetary companion .",
    "one can also check whether it is consistent to use a static binary lens model rather than one with rotating binary lens ( dominik @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , by comparing estimates for different lens populations ( e.g. the galactic halo and the lmc halo ) one may obtain indications to which population the lens belongs .",
    "in contrast to estimates on the mass spectrum , there is no direct influence from the ensemble of observed events on the estimates for a specific event .",
    "however , there is an indirect influence , since the ensemble of events gives information about the mass spectrum , which in turn can be used to get a more accurate estimate for each observed event .",
    "however , a lot of events ( @xmath261 ) are needed to get accurate information on the mass spectrum ( mao & paczyski @xcite ) . to be used for the estimates for a specific event , some of the higher mass moments should have been determined .",
    "note that there will remain large uncertainties in the mass of a specific event even if the mass spectrum is known ( unless it contains a sharp peak ) , since due to the broad distribution of the velocity , the range of timescales @xmath0 for a certain mass is broad , so that the mass range for a specific event in turn may also be large .    while a white dwarf scenario is preferred by the lmc observations ( e.g. pratt et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a brown - dwarf scenario is not ruled out ( spiro @xcite ) if one considers a flat halo .",
    "though there are some restrictions on the average lens mass from the observed events , which will improve with more data , it will remain highly uncertain into which mass regime a certain event falls .    since the ongoing microlensing observations constrain the galactic models and therefore give rise to more accurate determinations of the structure of the lens populations , the knowledge on specific events",
    "will also be improved by this .",
