    "recent arrival of the information age has created an explosive demand for knowledge and information exchange in our society .",
    "this demand has triggered off an enormous expansion in wireless communications in which severe technical challenges , including the need of transmitting speech , data and video at high rates in an environment rich of scattering , have been encountered . a recent development in wireless communication systems",
    "is the multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) wireless link which , due to its potential in meeting these challenges caused by fading channels together with power and bandwidth limitations , has become a very important area of research .",
    "the importance of mimo communications lies in the fact that they are able to provide a significant increase in capacity over single - input single - output ( siso ) channels .",
    "existing mimo designs employ multiple transmitter antennas and multiple receiver antennas to exploit the high symbol rate provided by the capacity available in the mimo channels .",
    "full symbol rate is achieved when , on average , one symbol is transmitted by each of the multiple transmitter antennas per time slot ( often called a  channel use \" ) . in the case of @xmath0 transmitter antennas , we will have an average of @xmath0 symbols per channel use ( pcu ) at full rate .",
    "furthermore , to combat fading and cross - talk , mimo systems provide different replicas of transmitted symbols to the receiver by using multiple receiver antennas with sufficient separation between each so that the fading for the receivers are independent of each other .",
    "such diversity can also be achieved at the transmitter by spacing the transmitter antennas sufficiently and introducing a code for the transmitted symbols distributed over transmitter antennas ( space ) and symbol periods ( time ) , i.e. , space - time coding  @xcite .",
    "full diversity is achieved when the total degree of freedom available in the multi - antenna system is utilized .    over the past several years",
    ", various space - time coding schemes have been developed to take advantage of the mimo communication channel .",
    "using a linear processor , orthogonal space - time block codes  @xcite can provide maximum diversity achievable by a maximum likelihood detector .",
    "however , they have a limited transmission rate  @xcite and thus , do not achieve full mimo channel capacity  @xcite .",
    "linear dispersion codes have been proposed in  @xcite for which each transmitted codeword is a linear combination of certain weighted matrices maximizing the ergodic capacity of the system .",
    "unfortunately , good error probability performance for these codes is not strictly guaranteed . to bridge the gap between multiplexing and diversity ,",
    "a linear dispersion code design has been proposed using frame theory  @xcite that typically performs well both in terms of ergodic capacity and error performance , but full diversity still can not be guaranteed . thus far , with the exception of the orthogonal stbc , all existing stbc are designed such that full diversity can only be achieved when the ml detector is employed .",
    "recent research  @xcite based on number theory has shown that employing a ml receiver , it is possible to design linear space - time block codes and dispersion codes which are full rate and full diversity without information loss .",
    "the major concern on these designs is that the coding gain vanishes rapidly as the constellation size increases .",
    "therefore , designs of full - rate , full - diversity space - time codes with non - vanishing coding gain have drawn much attention  @xcite since such structured space - time codes could achieve the optimal diversity - vs - multiplexing tradeoff developed by zheng and tse@xcite . however , most available stbc possessing these properties are for ml receivers only .",
    "in this paper , we consider a coherent communication system equipped with multiple transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna , i.e. , a miso system .",
    "these systems are often employed in mobile communications for which the mobile receiver may not be able to support multiple antennas .",
    "the highest transmission rate for a miso system is unity , i.e. , one symbol pcu .",
    "for such a miso system with ml receivers , rate-1 and full diversity stbc have been proposed by various authors  @xcite . in this paper , however , we consider such a miso system equipped with _ linear receivers _ for which we propose a general criterion for the design of a full - diversity stbc . in particular",
    ", we introduce the toeplitz stbc as a member of the family of the full diversity stbc .",
    "it should be noted that the toeplitz structure has already been successfully employed as a special case of the delay diversity code ( ddc ) @xcite applied to mimo systems having outer channel coding and ml detection .",
    "here , we extend its application to the construction of stbc in a miso system by having a toeplitz coding matrix cascaded with a beamforming matrix .",
    "we show that the toeplitz stbc has several important properties which enable the code , when applied to a miso system with a linear receiver , to asymptotically achieve unit symbol rate , to possess non - vanishing determinants for signal constellations having non - zero distance between nearest neighbours , and to achieve full diversity  @xcite accomplishing the optimal tradeoff of diversity and multiplexing gains  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we also consider the miso system in which the channel has zero mean and fixed covariance known to the transmitter . for such miso systems , sacrificing the transmission rate by repeating the transmitted symbols , and employing maximum ratio combining together with orthogonal space - time coding , an optimal precoder can be designed  @xcite by minimizing the upper bound of the average symbol error probability ( sep ) . here in this paper",
    ", we apply the toeplitz stbc to such a miso system .",
    "maintaining rate one and full diversity , we present a design that minimizes the _ exact _ worst case average pair - wise error probability when the ml detector is employed at the receiver .",
    "consider a mimo communication system having @xmath0 transmitter antennas and @xmath1 receiver antennas transmitting the symbols @xmath2 which are selected from a given constellation , i.e. , @xmath3 . to facilitate the transmission of these @xmath4 symbols through the @xmath0 antennas in the @xmath5 time slots ( channel use ) , each symbol",

    "full diversity gain is achieved when the total degrees of freedom ( @xmath96 ) offered in the multi - antenna system are utilized .",

    "it should be noted that when the signals are detected by a ml detector , the system coded with @xmath451 has higher diversity gain over the system with @xmath408 .",
