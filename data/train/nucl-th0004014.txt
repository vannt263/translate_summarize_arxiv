    "the @xmath1ray and conversion electron spectroscopies have contributed substantially to our knowledge of the nuclear decay schemes .",
    "the extensive tables of the theoretical internal conversion coefficients ( icc ) have enabled the investigators to derive from the spectroscopic data the multipolarities and total intensities of the electromagnetic transitions depopulating the excited nuclear states .",
    "existing tables of the icc cover wide region of the atomic numbers : 30@xmath0z@xmath0104 for all atomic shells @xcite and 10@xmath0z@xmath0104 for the k , l , and m shells @xcite .    very recently , reiter _",
    "@xcite investigated the z=102 isotope @xmath2no produced in a heavy ion reaction . by means of a multidetector @xmath1ray spectrometer",
    ", the authors identified the ground - state band of the even  even nucleus up to spin 14 .",
    "the transitions of energy less than 100 kev could not be seen in the @xmath1ray spectrum since they proceed almost entirely via emission of the conversion electrons . in connection with a great effort to produce superheavy ( sh ) nuclei ,",
    "e.g. the indication for formation of the z=118 , a=293 isotope @xcite , a further progress in the @xmath1ray and conversion electron spectroscopies can be expected . with this motivation",
    ", we calculated in this work the icc for sh elements with z up to 126 .",
    "the internal conversion coefficients for the elements with z @xmath3 104 were evaluated using the program nicc @xcite .",
    "the physical model used for the atom description was the hartree ",
    "fock one with the slater s exchange term , the nucleus was described as the finite one with the fermi distribution of charge . with the exception of the nucleus description ,",
    "this model is identical with that utilized by rsel _ et al _",
    "@xcite ( they used a homogenously charged sphere ) . the electron wavefunctions  both for the bound and free electrons  were calculated as solutions of the dirac equation with the atomic potential of lu _ et al _",
    "@xcite using the formulae of bhring @xcite .",
    "the conversion matrix elements were then evaluated by direct integration with reasonably small step .",
    "the resulting icc correspond to the first non - vanishing order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the kinetic energy of the converted electron is very well approximated by the difference between the transition energy and the binding energy of this electron before the conversion .",
    "since the electron binding energies are not known for the sh atoms , we used the eigenvalues from @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons for it .",
    "first , the eigenvalues @xcite approximate the binding energies fairly well ( up to tens of ev for the k ",
    "shell , up to ev s at the outermost shells ) for the lower z. second , the theoretical icc are not too sensitive to small changes of the electron kinetic energy ( except for the transition energies very close , say hundreds of ev , to the threshold ) .",
    "we have calculated the icc for all subshells of the elements with 104 @xmath0 z @xmath0 126 , the multipolarities e1  e4 and m1  m4 , and 16 energies from 10 kev up to 1 mev . altogether , almost 90000 coefficients were evaluated .",
    "the total icc s were determined using the subshell occupation numbers of @xcite .",
    "we did not notice any unusual behaviour of the subshell icc in the very high z region .",
    "generally , the subshell icc are increasing with z and the multipolarity , and decreasing with the transition energy .",
    "non - monotonous energy dependence can appear near the threshold .",
    "as exemplified in figure [ f : z_dep ] , the icc of this work represent a smooth extention of the tables of roesel _ et al _",
    "@xcite for z@xmath4104 . for z=104",
    ", we compared the two sets of the icc for various subshells and various transition energies and multipolarities . in 100 comparisons , the icc of reference @xcite and those of this work agreed typically within 1 - 2 % . in order to show the important role of the internal conversion in the region of superheavy elements , we present in table [ t : tab1 ] the total icc for every fifth z value and a wide scope of transition energies and multipolarities .",

    "for each atomic subshell , there is a discontinuity at its treshold energy .",
    "note that not all of them are seen in the logarithmic scale of figure [ f : zuby ] , in dependence on the relative contribution of the particular subshell to the total icc . for other multipolarities ,",
    "the subshells with another angular momenta can play more important role and the most pronounced discontinuity will appear at another energy ( e.g. at the l@xmath7 threshold for the m1 multipolarity and the l@xmath8 and l@xmath9 thresholds for the e2 one ) .",
    "figure [ f : zuby ] also demonstrates why it is not reasonable to interpolate in the tables of the total icc if the transition energy is not far enough above the k - shell threshold .",
    "if it is not possible to evaluate the icc for the particular energy directly , the only more or less reliable way is to interpolate in the tables of the subshell icc .",
    "we have to remind that the systematic errors unfortunately appeared in the tables of the _ total _ icc of roesel _ et al _  @xcite as explained in our previous work @xcite .",
    "( we also noticed that otherwise useful graphs of the icc , presented in appendix f1 of widely distributed table of isotopes @xcite show incorrect behaviour of the _ total _ icc in the neighbourhood of some energy thresholds . )",
    "considering the important role of the internal conversion we have also inspected the line shape which could be observed in the electron spectra in experiments with the sh nuclei .",
    "the measured spectra are influenced by energy losses and scattering of conversion electrons emerging from the target where they originated .    to estimate this effect we performed the monte carlo calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for description ) of electron scattering for the conditions typical in the experiments with sh nuclei .",
    "we considered the case of 600 nm thick lead target and the initial electron energy of 10 kev .",
    "the isotropic initial distribution of emitted conversion electrons was assumed apart from a possible angular dependence of electron emission in the case of nuclei produced in the reaction .",
    "assuming prompt electron emission from the created sh atoms , the homogeneous distribution of electron sources in the target volume was used .",
    "the total number of the simulated initial electrons was 10 millions .",
    "the energy distribution of all electrons emitted into the 2@xmath10 solid angle corresponding to the space behind the plane of the target surface was calculated .",
    "the curves corresponding to the convolution of the gaussian spectrometer response function with the mc calculated distribution are displayed in figure [ f : tonda ] .",
    "the gaussian curves with the fwhm = 0.5 and 1  kev were used .",
    "it is seen that in this case of a realistic instrumental resolution of the present semiconductor spectrometers the electron scattering in the target causes increase of the spectral line width but it does not hinder the observation of interesting internal conversion lines . moreover , with increasing electron energy and for thinner targets the effect of electron energy losses and scattering will be smaller .",
    "in addition , the sh atoms move after the recoil in nuclear reaction and therefore some conversion electrons can be emitted in the sites closer to the target surface or even outside of the target .    the more comprehensive monte carlo study of the electron scattering effect in the experiments with the sh nuclei will be presented at the conference mc2000 in lisbon .",
    "we have calculated the first internal conversion coefficients for sh elements .",
    "these theoretical data should facilitate planning of the heavy ion experiments aimed at production of the sh nuclei as well as interpretation of the electron spectra taken with future spectrometers . via monte carlo simulations we have demonstrated that the electron scattering and energy losses within today s reaction targets do not prevent the conversion electron spectroscopy down to 10 kev .",
    "the extensive tables of the subshell and total icc for 104@xmath0z@xmath0126 were deposited at lanl preprint server @xcite . for cases of special interest , we can calculate the necessary icc directly upon request . + * acknowledgement *   this work was supported by the grant agency of the czech republic under contract no .",
