    "a magnetic cancellation is an apparent convergence with a following disappearance of positive and negative magnetic patches observed in the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetograms of the solar photosphere @xcite .",
    "a cancellation is thought to be important not only for the photospheric magnetic flux budget @xcite but also for various solar activities ( e.g. solar flares , x - ray bright points , and filament formation ) .",
    "the physical structure and the dynamics of this phenomenon have , however , not been understood yet .",
    "two theoretical scenarios are proposed .",
    "one is a `` u - loop emergence '' scenario and the other is an `` @xmath0-loop submergence '' scenario @xcite . because these two scenarios are totally different in the flux transport between below the photosphere and the solar atmosphere , it is important to distinguish these by the observations .    the first observational study on the cancellation scenarios is reported by harvey et al .",
    "they investigated whether the magnetic loop submerges or emerges by determining the temporal evolution of the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields . if a cancellation occurs at the chromosphere after at the photosphere , it is interpreted as an emergence of a flux and vise versa .",
    "they found that a flux submergence is the most frequent ( 44@xmath1 ) as compared with a flux emergence ( 18@xmath1 ) and with other 38@xmath1 that shows no significant time difference .",
    "they also derived the submergence velocity ( @xmath2 ) by dividing the relative height between the two observed layers by the time difference .",
    "chae et al .",
    "( 2004 ) succeeded in the direct measurement of the doppler velocity structure around cancellation sites by using the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "they found a strong horizontal field and downflow ( @xmath2 ) around two cancellation sites in an active region .",
    "yang et al . (",
    "2009 ) also found the similar downflow ( @xmath3 ) at the cancellation sites in a coronal hole .",
    "these signatures support the `` @xmath0-loop submergence '' scenario .    on the contrary , there are some papers reporting the blue - shifts and no horizontal field around the cancellation sites .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2001 ) reported that they could not observe the transverse field connecting the canceling patch around the cancellations related with the filament eruption ( also see wang & shi(1993 ) ) .",
    "kubo @xmath4 shimizu ( 2007 ) investigated the vector magnetic field and the doppler velocity field around 14 cancellations in active regions .",
    "the result is that there are both upflow and downflow .",
    "they also found a center - to - limb variation that the absolute value of the observed velocity becomes larger near the limb than on the disk center .",
    "they concluded that these velocity structures indicate the material flow along the horizontal field .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2009 ) investigated the interaction between the magnetic activities ( e.g. flux emergences and cancellations ) and the granular motion and reported the upflow at the cancellation site .",
    "their interpretation of their cancellations is a `` u - loop emergence '' .",
    "the velocity field and the horizontal field around the cancellation sites are still open questions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the vector magnetic field and velocity structures of a cancellation in a quiet sun by using high - temporal and high - spatial resolution observations of the solar optical telescope on board hinode .",
    "the purpose of this study is to distinguish whether a cancellation is a `` u - loop emergence '' or an `` @xmath0-loop submergence '' .",
    "we use the data taken by the solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard the hinode spacecraft in this study @xcite . the image sequence obtained by the sot narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) of the filtergram ( fg ) on 2007 october 31th",
    "the region is a quiet sun in the south east part of the disk ; the center of the field of view is located at ( @xmath5 ) in the helio centric coordinate .",
    "stokes i and v components positioned at @xmath6 of the na i 5896 @xmath7 line at the observed wavelength are obtained by the nfi with pixel - resolution of 0.16 arcsec with an 82 arcsec @xmath8 82 arcsec field of view .",
    "the cadence is 1 minute and the resolution in wavelength is 0.1 @xmath7 .",
    "the contribution of nai 5896 @xmath7 line is the upper photosphere and the lower the chromosphere .",
    "we determine the temporal evolution of the los component of the magnetic field and the doppler velocity by using the nfi data sets .",
    "we also used the spectropolarimeter ( sp ) which takes the stokes profile of the two fei lines at 6301.5 @xmath7 and 6302.5 @xmath7 .",
    "these lines are formed in the photosphere .",
    "we calculate various physical quantities by fitting the spectra on the assumption of the milne - eddington atmospheric model ( e.g. del toro iniesta , 2003 ; t. yokoyama et al . , 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the field of view is 82 arcsec @xmath8 82 arcsec .",
    "the number of observational points is 112 in wavelength with resolution of 0.03 @xmath7 .",
    "we use the fast mode sp data .",
    "the cadence for one step was 3.8 seconds and the duration for one scan was 15 minutes .",
    "the time duration of sp data is 20 minutes and sometimes 50 minutes due to the synoptic observation of hinode .",
    "the time period of nif observation is from 15:04 ut to 23:30 ut on 2007 october 31th .",
    "the spatial scale is 0.32 arcsec @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate the temporal evolution of magnetic field from fg by calculating the @xmath10 as an indicator of the los magnetic field .",
    "@xmath10 is defined as    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is the stokes - v signal in the blue wing and @xmath13 is the stokes - v signal in the red wing . as the los magnetic field becomes stronger , the amplitude of stokes - v signal arises and then the absolute value of @xmath10 becomes larger .",
    "we employ @xmath14 calculated from the fg data as an indicator of a los velocity .",
    "@xmath14 is defined as    @xmath15    @xmath16 and @xmath17 are intensities of blue and red component in stokes - i signal , respectively .",
    "the actual zero point of @xmath14 is set as the average of @xmath14 over the field of view is zero .",
    "we derive the theoretical relationship between @xmath14 and the actual doppler - shift using the line profile of solar spectrum atlas and the trancemittance profile of the nfi .",
    "the relationship between an los velocity and @xmath14 is nearly linear in the range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we used 10 as the conversion factor from @xmath14 to actual doppler velocity .",
    "figure 1 shows the los component of magnetic fields taken by sp(left ) and the nfi(right ) .",
    "left panel is a sub - region of the sp map .",
    "the square in the left panel shows the field of view of the right panels .",
    "the plotted time in the left panel is when the slit is at the cancellation site , namely at -547.82 arcsec in x coordination .",
    "figure 2 shows the scanned maps taken by sot / sp .",
    "the positive and negative patches with the mean magnetic flux density of @xmath20 were located with separation by 2 arcsec at 15:46 ut ( left panels in fig .",
    "2 ) . these patches approached by apparent proper velocity with @xmath21 and began canceling with each other ( middle and right panels in fig .",
    "2 ) . at 17:21 ut ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the negative patch disappeared completely , while the positive one remained partially .",
    "the duration of this event defined by the contact of the magnetic patches and the disappearance of the negative polarity was @xmath22 from 16:25 ut to 17:21 ut .",
    "as shown in the bottom panels of figure 2 , it is found that a transverse field appears between the patches in the sot / sp scan maps during the cancellation process at 16:36 ut and 16:56 ut . the magnetic flux density of this transverse field was @xmath20 and the direction was in parallel with that connecting the magnetic patches .",
    "note that because of the azimuth - angle 180 degree ambiguity , we do not know , at this moment , whether the orientation is from positive to negative or opposite .",
    "figure 3 shows the dopplergram obtained from the @xmath14 parameters taken by the sot / fg observations .",
    "since we are focusing on the velocity structure corresponding to the cancellation event with a time scale of @xmath22 , the dopplergrams are temporally averaged by using several nearby flames in @xmath23 to remove the shorter - period features such as the 5-minute oscillations and the granular flows . from figure 3 , it is found that there is a strong red - shift ( downflow ) signature around / at the canceling magnetic patches .",
    "this red - shift appeared with @xmath24 from 16:43 ut to 17:25 ut until the end of the canceling process and significantly long - lasting compared to the 5-minutes oscillation ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of the spatially integrated @xmath10 parameter as a proxy of the magnetic flux for each of the magnetic patches .",
    "the magnetic flux of the negative patch monotonically decreased from the beginning of the cancellation at 16:25 ut to the end at 17:21 ut . except for the temporary increase in 16:45 ",
    "17:00 ut caused by a coalescence of two adjacent positive patches , the positive flux was also decreasing by the similar rate with the negative flux in the same period .",
    "the time of the observed transverse field connecting the canceling patches are indicated by the arrows at 16:36 ut and 16:56 ut , which are well in the period of the canceling processes .",
    "each asterisk indicates the averaged red - shift speed in the @xmath25 box centered by the peak red - shift nearby the canceling patches at each time .",
    "this speed is averaged over 25 pixels around the max velocity point .",
    "the red - shift began to increase from 16:43 and reached @xmath26 at 16:55 ut .",
    "it decreased rapidly after the cancellation at 17:21 ut .",
    "the averaged value is @xmath27 in this period during the cancellation .",
    "note that there was a delay by 20 min for this red - shift signature against the start of the cancellation .",
    "we studied detailed magnetic and velocity structures of a cancellation event by using the unprecedented high quality data obtained by the sot on board hinode .",
    "our observations are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) a transverse field connecting the pair magnetic patches is found during the canceling process .",
    "( 2 ) there was a long - lasting red - shift ( downflow ) signature with @xmath24 around the canceling magnetic patches lasting for 40 minutes .",
    "the start of this doppler red - shift delays by 20 minutes from the start of the canceling process .    the transverse field connecting the canceling patches are consistent with both the `` u - loop emergence '' and `` @xmath0-loop submergence '' scenarios .",
    "it is still difficult to discriminate the preferable scenario only from the magnetic information since we could not identify the orientation of the transverse field due to the azimuth - angle 180 degree ambiguity .",
    "note if the orientation is from positive patch to negative , it is consistent with the `` @xmath0-loop '' and the vice versa .",
    "the velocity information in our data sets help the interpretation as shown in the following discussion .",
    "there was a steady red - shift signature with @xmath28 around the canceling magnetic patches for 40 minutes .",
    "we can calculate the total amount of the disappeared vertical magnetic flux ( @xmath29 ) by the cancellation and that of the submerged horizontal flux ( @xmath30 ) by assuming the direction of the transverse field and velocity field .",
    "these fluxes should be comparable .",
    "we assume that the direction of the transverse field is connecting from the positive patch to the negative patch in the @xmath0-loop scenario .",
    "the amount of @xmath29 is equivalent with the flux in the single isolated patch , namely , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 are the magnetic flux density and the area of the negative patch before the cancellation process , respectively ( left panel of fig .",
    "the amount of the horizontal field in the submerging flux is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the magnetic flux density and the width of the submerging horizontal component ( middle panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 is the submerging speed calculated from red - shift @xmath40 and @xmath41 is its lifetime .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath30 have similar values , the submergence scenario can explain the local budget of the magnetic flux .",
    "what is the submerging mechanism of the @xmath0-loop submergence ? from the dynamical point of view , the magnetic buoyancy might prevent the @xmath0-loop from submerging . to overcome this buoyancy",
    ", the magnetic tension force has to be stronger , i.e. the curvature radius of the @xmath0-loop has to be short enough .",
    "the critical value is around several times of the pressure scale height .",
    "the observed distance between the pair patches as a proxy of the curvature radius was @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "2 ) which was three times the photospheric pressure scale height ( @xmath43 ) and was short enough for the excess of the tension over the buoyancy force . the red - shift speed is a fraction ( @xmath44 ) of the estimated local alfvn speed @xmath45 by using the observed @xmath46 and assuming the photospheric density @xmath47 .",
    "this is again consistent with the submergence by the magnetic tension force .",
    "we also found the delay of the red - shift speed relative to the cancellation .",
    "we do not understand the reason yet but we speculate that this delay may show the necessity of the convergence of the magentic patches which is enough for the magnetic tension to overcome the magnetic buoyancy .",
    "figure 5 shows our speculative model for a quiet - sun cancellation based on the `` @xmath0-loop submergence '' scenario .",
    "first , a pair of isolated magnetic fluxes are convected by the supergranulation flows .",
    "when they come in contact at a short distance , they reconnect at a certain height ( not specified here ) above the na i forming layer . to generate the horizontal field , i.e. an `` @xmath0-loop '' structure .",
    "the foot - points of the magnetic fluxes meanwhile continue to be passively convected by the flows to converge until the magnetic tension overcomes the magnetic buoyancy .",
    "finally , when the magnetic fluxes become close enough with each other , the magnetic tension dominates over the magnetic buoyancy . then , the `` @xmath0-loop '' begins to submerge . in this scenario , the main cause of the submergence is the tension of the magnetic flux .",
    "note that cheung et al.(2008 ) refers that the @xmath0-loop submergence caused by the magnetic tension in their numerical simulation and the observed downflow around the cancellation site of the flux emergence region .",
    "our submerging speed ( @xmath48 ) had the similar value with that ( @xmath49 ) reported by chae et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in an active - region cancellation .",
    "it is also consistent with the statistical study by harvey et al .",
    "( 1999 ) with the apparent speed ( @xmath49 ) obtained by using the temporal difference between the timings of the cancellation process in the chromospheric and in the photospheric levels . in numerical simulation , cheung et al.(2008 )",
    "reports much larger submerging speed .",
    "the downflows are larger in both numerical simulation ( @xmath50 ) and observation ( @xmath51 ) than that in this study .",
    "such a super - sonic flow may be caused by the small length of the loop in their numerical simulation @xmath52 arcsec and by the strong surrounding magnetic loops .",
    "kubo & shimizu ( 2007 ) reported that there are both upflow and downflow around the cancellation sites and the direction of the horizontal field is nearly aligned to the polarity inversion line between the canceling pair in active regions .",
    "they interpreted the high doppler velocity with both blue and red component as the velocity of the material flow along the magnetic field from the center - to - limb variation of the doppler velocity .",
    "their cancellations are frequently associated by a filament formation that might suggest an emergence of a new flux at the cancellation site .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of the cancellation might be different between the active regions and quiet sun .",
    "note that there is a possibility that the observed red - shift is the velocity of the material flow along the field line .",
    "it requires the statistical study of the quiet sun cancellations to examine this possibility .",
    "if our velocity structure around the cancellation site is magnetic flux motion , we would not see the centor - to - limb variation in the doppler velocity .",
    "it is necessary to check the generality of our scenario in the application for the cancellation events ubiquitously observed in the quiet sun .",
    "we are doing the statistical studies and will report in a separate paper .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the structures above the cancellation sites in the upper chromosphere , transition region and corona .",
    "since reconnection events in these regions might take place along with the photospheric cancellation , explosive brightenings might be observed in uv , euv or x - rays @xcite .",
    "the data sets of the other two hinode instruments , eis and xrt , are under our on - going investigation .",
    "we express our appreciation to my colleague in isas / jaxa , naoj , kyoto university , and the university of tokyo for useful discussion .",
    "we are grateful to drs .",
    "m. kubo and y. katsukawa for useful comments .",
