    "in a high @xmath0 universe , the density of the most massive clusters will be vanishingly small at high redshift .",
    "this density rises rapidly as @xmath0 decreases , meaning that the discovery of only one or two massive clusters at a redshift of @xmath1@xmath21 has the potential to rule out @xmath0@xmath31 to high significance @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity has meant that measurements of cluster abundances . ]",
    "have become a popular means by which to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "however , one has to be extremely cautious when making cluster abundance measurements , since any observational bias which mimics an under ( or over ) abundance of massive clusters will lead to an over ( or under ) estimate of @xmath0 .    for example",
    ", one could mimic an under abundance of massive clusters in an x - ray selected survey , such as the emss @xcite @xcite , if the optical follow - up was incomplete : optical follow - up becomes increasingly difficult as redshift increases and so there is a finite probability that some high @xmath1 clusters will be missed and that other clusters will be assigned incorrect redshifts .",
    "the optical follow - up of the emss cluster sample is now complete @xcite , but in an earlier version of the catalog @xcite , one high redshift ( @xmath1@xmath40.5 ) cluster was missed ( ms1610.4 ) and two more had underestimated redshifts ( ms1054.4 & ms1137.5 ) .",
    "small errors like these have a significant effect on measured parameters , such as the significance of measured luminosity evolution @xcite and on the value of @xmath0 @xcite .    to date",
    ", the analysis of cluster abundances has been made in the context of the press - schechter formalism , which gives an analytical relation for the number density of _ virialized _ dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift @xcite .",
    "when even a small fraction of the high redshift clusters in a given catalog have artificially high masses , then the press - schechter derived value of @xmath0 will be too low .",
    "this situation could easily occur in an x - ray selected survey , if one has to rely on _ global _ x - ray luminosity or temperature measurements to derive the cluster masses : if a cluster has significant subclustering , _",
    "ms1054.4 @xcite , then the derived mass can be higher than the virial mass .",
    "viana & liddle conclude that , `` at present the observational data and the theoretical modelling carry sufficiently large associated uncertainties to prevent an unambiguous determination of @xmath0 '' @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that the emss yields best fit values that range from @xmath0=0.2 @xcite to @xmath0=1 @xcite .",
    "the two main observational issues that need to be addressed when attempting to measure @xmath0 from cluster abundances are ; ( _ i _ ) the completeness of the cluster catalog under study and ( _ ii _ ) the accuracy of the cluster mass estimates .",
    "we describe the positive impact that axaf & xmm will have in both areas below .    [ [ improving - cluster - mass - estimates ] ] improving cluster mass estimates : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it has been shown that there is a tight relationship between cluster mass and x - ray temperature ( @xmath5 ) in a virialized system @xcite .",
    "existing @xmath5 data , derived from asca and ginga observations @xcite , provide only weak constraints on @xmath0 @xcite , but we can expect these constraints to tighten dramatically after the launch of axaf and xmm . these satellites will provide @xmath5 values more accurately , and more efficiently , than ever before . as an illustration ,",
    "let us compare the expected countrates flux quoted in @xcite .",
    "] for the most luminous cluster in the emss ( ms0015.9 , @xmath1=0.54 ) in the axaf acis - i camera ( 0.15 s@xmath6 ) , the xmm epic pn - camera ( 0.57 s@xmath6 ) and an asca sis camera ( 0.05 s@xmath6 ) . with @xmath72000 photons , or a 13 ks acis - i observation",
    ", one can measure @xmath5 for this cluster to a reasonable accuracy ( @xmath8@xmath90.2 ) @xcite .",
    "it is likely , given the excellent spatial resolution of axaf & xmm ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively ) that many guest observers will request exposure times long enough to make spatially resolved temperature maps of high redshift clusters .",
    "( with asca , these sorts of maps have only been feasible for high flux , low redshift , clusters @xcite . )",
    "these efforts should be encouraged , since temperature maps allow one to correct @xmath5 for the influence of shock fronts at subcluster boundaries and of cooling flows in the cluster core .",
    "the exposure times required will be high , but over the lifetime of the satellites ( @xmath12 years ) , we can expect temperature maps to become available for a significant fraction of known x - ray clusters at @xmath13 .",
    "for example , to measure a @xmath5 value in 4 independent radial apertures for ms0015.9 , one would require @xmath14 ks with axaf or @xmath15 ks with xmm .",
    "[ [ towards - new - cluster - samples ] ] towards new cluster samples : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in addition to the emss , which was produced from einstein - ipc data , there are now several samples of x - ray selected , high redshift , clusters based on rosat pspc data _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these rosat surveys cover smaller areas because the pspc instrument was retired after only 4 years in service . ]",
    "( @xmath16 ) than the emss ( @xmath17 ) , which is a distinct disadvantage , since it is areal coverage , not flux limit , that determines the number of high @xmath1 , high mass , clusters in a given survey .",
    "for example , in only a 1 ks xmm observation one could detect a massive cluster at @xmath1@xmath31 to a signal - to - noise greater than 10 .",
    "( here we define a `` massive cluster '' to be one with a luminosity greater than @xmath18 , where @xmath18@xmath73e44 erg / s @xcite . )",
    "but , since these clusters are so rare beyond @xmath1@xmath30.3 , one would need to make @xmath7420 , non - overlapping , xmm pointings to guarantee a single detection .",
    "( this estimate was based on the number of 0.3@xmath9@xmath1@xmath91 , @xmath19@xmath4@xmath18 clusters in the emss @xcite . )    apart from a possible `` xmm slew survey '' , which would have an effective exposure time of less than @xmath20 seconds ( david lumb , private communication ) , there are no plans to use either xmm or axaf as survey instruments .",
    "any new cluster catalogs would , therefore , have to be based on serendipitous detections . given the growing number of rosat derived cluster catalogs , and the huge areal coverage of the emss , would yet another serendipitous cluster survey be worthwhile ?",
    "we suggest that is it not only worthwhile , but imperative .",
    "this is because all surveys to date have been based on less than ideal x - ray data , meaning one can not fully define their selection functions , and hence completeness , using simulations .",
    "for example , ( _ i _ ) several of the emss clusters were detected at only the @xmath21 level @xcite and ( _ ii _ ) rosat - pspc cluster surveys which rely on source extent have problems with blended emission ( blends make up @xmath22 of the cluster candidates in the bright sharc sample @xcite ) .",
    "the only way to remove observational biases like these is to create a new cluster sample based on higher quality x - ray data .",
    "if the xmm - epic camera remains in service during the whole lifetime of the satellite , then one could use it to build up an x - ray cluster survey with the same areal coverage as the emss . under the conservative assumption of only 3 pointings per day , then xmm would be able to cover a total area of 2200 @xmath23 in 10 years .",
    "( the xmm field of view is @xmath24 compared to @xmath25 for the einstein - ipc . )",
    "not all of the available area will be of use to a cluster survey , however , since some will fall in the galactic plane and some will be in the field of diffuse x - ray sources , such as low @xmath1 clusters and supernova remnants . using the rosat archive as a guide , one can expect that only @xmath71/3 of the xmm pointings will be suitable for a serendipitous cluster survey , but this would still yield @xmath26 over the lifetime of the satellite ) than that of xmm .",
    "in addition , unlike xmm , axaf is not able to produce imaging data when the diffraction gratings are in place .",
    ". such a survey will be aided both by the planned pipeline processing at the xmm survey science center and by the spatial resolution of the epic cameras : the xmm spatial resolution is better , even at the edges of the fov , than the on - axis resolution of the rosat - pspc .",
    "this means that far fewer blended point sources will be falsely flagged as cluster candidates , which in turn eases optical follow - up .",
    "in addition , a new xmm cluster sample will require much less x - ray follow - up than the emss or the rosat - pspc samples .",
    "this is because the majority of xmm exposures are expected to be at least ten times longer than the 1 ks required for a @xmath27 detection of a @xmath1=1 , @xmath18 cluster .",
    "therefore , most serendipitous cluster observations will yield sufficient counts to allow cluster profiles and global @xmath5 values to be measured directly .",
    "measurements of cluster abundances allow one to place strict constraints on the value of @xmath0 which are independent from those derived from high redshift supernovae or from cosmic microwave background fluctuations .",
    "after the launch of axaf & xmm , it will be possible to remove several observational biases that have dogged previous attempts to measure @xmath0 from cluster abundances .",
    "progress will come via the derivation of accurate virial temperatures for a large number of clusters and via the development of a new , large area , cluster survey .",
