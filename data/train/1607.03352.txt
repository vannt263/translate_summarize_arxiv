    "after prediction and detection of the spin hall effect @xcite ( she ) , the spin - dependent electronic transport has been a central focus of investigation in mesoscopic physics because of its possible applications to spintronics @xcite .",
    "generation of dissipationless spin current @xcite is one of the features that is believed to be crucial in this respect . in early attempts ,",
    "generation of spin - polarized currents were obtained by attaching ferromagnetic metallic contacts to the semiconductors @xcite .",
    "but , the efficiency of the spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor is poor because of the conductivity mismatch @xcite between the two .",
    "this drawback can be overcome by producing spin - polarized current intrinsically .",
    "here comes the role of spin - orbit ( so ) interaction .",
    "a strong spin - orbit scattering generates spin - polarized electrons intrinsically @xcite .    in general , two types of spin - orbit coupling terms",
    "can be present in semiconductor heterostructures having two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) .",
    "one of them is the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling ( dsoc ) which originates from the inversion asymmetry of the zinc blende type of structures @xcite .",
    "the other is the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) which originates due to the effective electric field originating from the asymmetry of the potential confining the 2des @xcite .",
    "the dresselhaus term is found to be dominant in large band gap materials and the strength can be controlled easily by tunning the quantum well width @xcite . on the other hand , the rashba term is dominant in narrow - gap systems where the strength of the rashba term can be controlled by external gate voltages @xcite .",
    "the interplay of both types of spin - orbit coupling on the conductance characteristics of nanostructures has been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "geometry of the scattering region also plays an important role in order to study effects of spin - polarization in presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "four terminal junction devices have been studied where unpolarized charge current is driven through the longitudinal leads attached to a semiconducting region with so coupling induces a pure spin current at the transverse voltage probes without accompanying any charge current @xcite .",
    "in particular , three terminal structures such as t - shaped @xcite , y - shaped @xcite devices have also been studied in presence of spin - orbit interaction . in a three terminal structure , one terminal acts as an input to the device ,",
    "through which unpolarized charge current is injected into the device .",
    "the other two terminals act as outputs through which the spin - polarized currents flow out of the device .",
    "since a three terminal structure is a suitable candidate for studying the she , in this paper , we have studied the behaviour of a special type of three terminal device with y - shaped structure.since the angular separation between the arms of the y - shaped geometry can be relevant for studying she , we have considered different angles as shown in fig.[setup ] . also because the rotational symmetry is broken in spin space in presence of the spin - orbit interaction , the spin quantization axes also play an important role in the context of she .",
    "motivated by these , we have studied the effects of the angular variation and orientation of the spin quantization axes on the spin hall conductance of such a y - shaped junction with tunable so interactions .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in the following section",
    ", we present a prescription of fabricating a y - shaped device .",
    "the theoretical formalism leading to the expression for the spin hall conductance using landauer - bttiker formula are presented in the next section .",
    "after that we include an elaborate discussion of the results obtained for the spin hall conductance in presence of the so interaction .",
    "we have included an interesting comparison for the conductance properties in presence of rashba vis - a - vis dresselhaus so interactions .",
    "we begin our discussion by a prescription of fabricating a y - shaped junction device which should be interesting from an experimental perspective .    we choose a three - probe measuring set - up as shown in fig.[setup ] to observe the spin hall effect . here",
    "the three ideal semi - infinite leads are attached to the central conducting region , which in our case is the y - shaped device having a square lattice geometry and includes spin orbit interaction .",
    "the leads denoted by 1 , 2 and 3 are semi - infinite in nature .",
    "the voltages applied at the leads are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the width of the scattering region is @xmath3 , while the arms has width @xmath4 . in this work ,",
    "we have taken three different y - shapes by changing the angle between the two arms of the y , and call it @xmath5 as shown in fig.[setup ] .",
    "fig.[angle ] provides a technique of how one can fix the angle , @xmath5 . according to fig.[setup ]",
    ", @xmath5 is twice the angle as shown in fig.[angle ] . for the y - shape shown in fig.[setup](a ) , we add the lattice sites in the arms of y as depicted in fig.[angle](a ) .",
    "first we add three sites along @xmath6-axis with spacing ` @xmath7 ' and then add another site along @xmath8-axis just above the third site along @xmath6 .",
    "we repeat the same procedure to build up the rest of the arm of the y - geometry .",
    "since we need three sites along @xmath6-axis and two sites along @xmath8-axis we call it a ( 3,2 ) scheme . the calculation of the angle in now straight forward from the geometry . from fig.[angle ] , @xmath9 is the base of the triangle and @xmath10 is the height . in the ( 3,2 ) scheme , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the angular separation between the arms of the y will be twice the calculated angle and is , @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , corresponding to @xmath14 , we need the ( 2,2 ) scheme , for which two sites along @xmath6-axis and one site along @xmath8-axis above the second site along @xmath6 are required , as shown in fig.[angle](b ) . in the given case , @xmath15 . to obtain an angle , @xmath5 greater than @xmath16 ,",
    "we adopt ( 2,3 ) scheme as shown in fig.[angle](c ) . here , @xmath17 .",
    "however , we have been able to generate a number of other values for the angular separation , @xmath5 by following the prescription given above .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian for an electron in presence of both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction in a two dimensional electron system is given by , @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the two dimensional momentum operator , @xmath21 is the effective mass , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the components of the pauli matrices . @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 respective denote the rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling strengths .",
    "we discretize the hamiltonian via a tight binding approximation with nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian becomes ,    @xmath26\\nonumber\\\\ + v_d\\sum\\limits_{i } \\left[(-i)\\left(c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i+\\delta_x \\downarrow } +    c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i+\\delta_x \\uparrow}\\right )    +    \\left(c_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i+\\delta_y \\downarrow } -    c_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger } c_{i+\\delta_y \\uparrow}\\right ) \\right ] \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath27 is the on - site potential and @xmath28 is the hopping strength , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the rashba and dresselhaus coupling strengths respectively , @xmath7 being the lattice constant .",
    "@xmath31 is the unit vector along @xmath32 direction .",
    "it is assumed that the rashba and dresselhaus so interactions are present only in the y - shaped device .",
    "the leads are metallic and semi - infinite in nature .",
    "the leads are free from any kind of so interactions so as to avoid any kind or spin flips at the boundaries .",
    "since the rotational symmetry in spin space is lost in presence of spin - orbit interaction , the quantization axes of the spin play a vital role in measuring spin current .",
    "hence we choose the spin quantization axis along an arbitrary direction , say @xmath33 , pointing along @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the usual spherical angles @xmath38 .",
    "now we proceed to evaluate the expression for spin hall conductance . in order to get pure spin current",
    ", we treat terminal 2 as a voltage probe ( fig.[setup ] ) . as a result pure spin",
    "current will flow through terminal 2 , due to the flow of charge current between terminals 1 and 3 .",

    "the hopping integral becomes @xmath81 1.8 ev ( from the discussion following eq.([h ] ) ) .",
    "also in inalas / ingaas it is found that the rashba parameter is , @xmath82 ev - m @xcite . then in our case ,",
    "@xmath83 ev . since we are denoting all the energy units in terms of @xmath76 , @xmath84 . which is pretty small",

    "in fact , we have considered the rashba and dresselhaus coupling parameters in the interval @xmath90 $ ] .    in this work ,",
    "we have taken three different angles for the y - shaped device , such as , @xmath5 values to be less than , equal to and greater than @xmath16 .",
