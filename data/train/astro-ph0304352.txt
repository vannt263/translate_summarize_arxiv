    "the dedicated f/5 ritchey - chrtien - like 2.5 m telescope has a three - degree field of view . in the spectroscopic mode , up to 640 ( 180@xmath4 m or 3 arcsec  ) fibers can be simultaneously positioned on the focal plane to feed two identical spectrographs .",

    "galaxies and quasar candidates take about 90% of the fibers , with the remaining used to observe the sky background and galactic stars , which are either selected for being _ peculiar _ ( brown dwarfs , blue - horizontal branch stars , carbon stars , etc . ) , or intended for reddening and flux calibration .",
    "in addition , almost a third of the quasar candidates in the early data release turned out to be stars .",
    "nearly @xmath0 stellar spectra will be released by the end of the survey in 2006 . with exposure times per plate of the order of 45 minutes",
    ", the targeted stars have @xmath5 magnitudes in the range 1421 , signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath6 ) between 5 and 150 , and lie at distances of up to hundreds of kiloparsecs from the galactic plane .",
    "when released , the sdss stellar spectra will constitute the largest spectroscopic survey of the galactic thick - disk and halo populations yet assembled .",
    "the analysis of a massive dataset calls for automated procedures . the sdss images and spectra",
    "are processed by a series of pipelines specialized in tasks such as astrometric , wavelength , and flux calibrations , aperture photometry , or the extraction and classification of spectra . starting from the released photometry and spectra for galactic stars , we are interested in a detailed classification based on the fundamental atmospheric parameters . projected radial velocities are directly measurable from the spectra . given the large spectral coverage , we expect to be able to quantify the interstellar reddening towards the observed stars .",
    "stellar metallicities , and even perhaps the abundance ratios of chemical elements or groups of elements well - represented in the spectra , are obviously some of the most valuable information to search for .",
    "it is also most interesting to use the derived stellar parameters , chemical abundances , and interstellar reddening to infer distances and ages .",
    "we make use of the sdss ( @xmath7 ) photometry and the @xmath8 pixels in an object s spectrum altogether .",
    "we found it helpful to trade resolution for @xmath6 , and therefore the spectra are smoothed to @xmath9 by convolution with a gaussian profile . as absolute fluxes are not relevant at this point , we use photometric indices and normalize the spectra @xmath10 to satisfy @xmath11 .",

    "this parameter gives one more dimension to the grid .",
    "we consider @xmath25 in the range @xmath27 with just three values .",

    "the weights for the spectra are heavily biased towards lines , which carry most of the information on the parameters we are interested in .",
    "the relevant lines in the optical spectrum of a metal - poor star , at the resolution and @xmath6 we are dealing with , are only a few : balmer lines , ca ii h and k , the ca ii ir triplet , the na d lines , the mg i b triplet , and a number of strong lines of the iron - peak elements ( mainly fe i ) . by adjusting the weights ,",

    "the results of two new runs where the lines of ca and mg were given enhanced weights , while lines of the iron - peak elements were disregarded , and viceversa , are labeled as [ @xmath28/h ] and [ fe / h ] , respectively .",
    "for the most metal - poor stars , in particular for the warmer stars , most metal lines are too weak for detection in the edr spectra , and ca ii k remains as the only reliable metallicity indicator . in that regime",

    "however , both [ @xmath28/fe ] and [ @xmath28/a ] may still be reliable at [ fe / h ] @xmath29 [ a / h ] @xmath80 , where a clear discrepancy is shown between measurements and our assumptions about the enhancement of @xmath28 elements in eq .",

    "the stellar atmospheric parameters and the interstellar reddening are directly disentangled with reasonable accuracy from the spectra and broad - band photometry through standard spectral analysis techniques .",
    "chemical abundances for selected elements can also be extracted .",
    "given the volume of data  sdss will probably obtain spectra for @xmath0 stars  the analysis requires automated procedures that we implement through a pre - calculated grid of model fluxes coupled to an optimization algorithm . stellar evolution theory allows us to constrain interesting stellar parameters such as masses , radii , and ages , as well as to estimate distances , once the atmospheric parameters have been derived .",
    "a preliminary analysis of nearly 5000 spectra in the early data release ( edr ) shows most sdss dwarf stars belong to the thick disk of the milky way .",
