    "variable stars are crucial astrophysical objects since they can be used as tracers of stellar populations in the framework of galaxy evolution ( @xcite ) . moreover , the comparison between the observables predicted by pulsational models and the observations themselves supply an independent estimate of the stellar parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that stellar pulsations provide a way to probe regions of the star that would be otherwise unaccessible to direct observations .",
    "therefore , variable stars provide the unique opportunity to investigate the plausibility of the physical assumptions adopted to construct both evolutionary and pulsational models ( @xcite ) .    nonadiabatic stellar pulsations are complicated phenomena , even for small amplitudes and purely radial oscillations , to which the linear theory is applicable . for large amplitudes ,",
    "the nonlinear effects become important and the simplifying assumptions must be treated with caution . during the last decades the work on nonlinear stellar pulsations has been developed along three main approaches : simple one - zone models , the formalism of amplitude equations and hydrodynamical models .",
    "although the third approach provides the most detailed and accurate physical description of the outermost stellar layers during the pulsation cycle , it is also true that it is difficult to figure out whether the intrinsic features of the models are either a direct consequence of the adopted physical assumptions or caused by the numerical methods and the spatial resolution adopted to discretize the stellar structure into a series of concentric shells  see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is within this framework where simple one - zone models ( @xcite ) , and the amplitude equation formalism ( @xcite ) , play a key role .",
    "the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches have already been widely discussed in the literature  see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein , and @xcite ) . in particular , one - zone models have been introduced with the sole purpose of clarifying the analysis by eliminating possible subtle uncertainties introduced by the stability of numerical algorithms and by spatial resolution .",
    "this was accomplished by considering the stellar envelope as a one - zone structure : a single , relatively thin , spherical mass - shell concentric with the stellar center .",
    "these models have provided clear understanding of the destabilization mechanisms and of the possible consequences of couplings as well as feedbacks between several phenomena associated to stellar variability  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the simplest one - zone model that accounts for the coupling between pulsation and convection was suggested by @xcite .",
    "following the convective scheme developed by @xcite , he derived a one - zone pulsational model that includes a time - dependent convective term .",
    "he computed a set of models associated to the cepheid instability strip , integrating them only for a few dynamical time scales .",
    "the results of this work support the generally accepted view that convection is a damping mechanism , in particular for models located close to the cool edge of the instability strip .",
    "although the pulsationally unstable region as well as velocity curves were in qualitative agreement with empirical data , he also found that fully convective models underwent vibrational instability for certain values of the parameters .",
    "a similar approach was also adopted by @xcite and by @xcite , but they did not discuss in detail the pulsational and dynamical behavior of their models .    in this work , we present new results and possible extensions of the one - zone model developed by @xcite , investigating the limit - cycle behavior ( pulsational instability ) and by accounting for the role of the turbulent pressure and of the thickness of the convective layer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the one - zone convective model .",
    "we place special emphasis on the adopted physical and numerical assumptions . in ",
    "3 we thoroughly investigate the limit - cycle behavior of the model suggested by @xcite , an issue marginally addressed in the original paper . in this section , we also focus our attention on the dependence of pulsation properties on the shell thickness (  3.1 ) as well as on the turbulent pressure (  3.2 ) and their role in determining the morphology of light and velocity curves . in  4 we discuss the approach to limit - cycle stability of completely convective models and briefly describe possible empirical similarities with lpvs .",
    "finally , in  6 we summarize our main results and briefly outline future perspectives . in appendix",
    "a , we discuss in more detail the physical assumptions adopted to include the turbulent pressure in the one - zone model are described .",
    "in the classical theoretical framework of one - zone models , variable stars have an equilibrium radius @xmath0 and an extended shell or envelope of variable radius @xmath1 on top of a compact core of radius @xmath2 .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , by accounting for the equation of motion , the energy equation , and the equation of convective transport , the resultant dynamical system describes the evolution of the convective upper layer and it has the following form :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the radius and the nonadiabatic pressure normalized to their equilibrium values , while @xmath6 is related to the convective velocity and it is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the equilibrium mixing - length convective velocity .",
    "moreover , the time variable , @xmath9 , is normalized to the dynamical ( free - fall ) time scale . as defined in @xcite ,",
    "the other input parameters of the model are : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the adiabatic exponent and @xmath14 is the so - called form factor . in the limit of small oscillations ( @xcite )",

    "the main control parameters of the model are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are defined as follows : _",
    "i ) the nonadiabatic parameter _  @xmath21  the ratio between the dynamical and the thermal time scale ; _ ii ) the convective efficiency _  @xmath24  the ratio between the dynamical time and the convective time scale ; _ iii ) the convective / radiative splitting _",
    " @xmath25  the ratio between the initial convective luminosity and the total initial luminosity , that is , @xmath26 , which implies that @xmath27 .",
    "the reader interested in a detailed discussion concerning the convective time scale in the context of one - zone models is referred to  4 of @xcite .",
    "more quantitative predictions concerning the different timescales connected with turbulent energy across the envelope of variable stars have been provided by @xcite , @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the kramers opacity are the standard ones , while the values for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 must be treated with caution .",
    "the value of @xmath30 adopted in @xcite is a typical value for the @xmath31-mechanism operating in the partial ionization regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of a form factor @xmath14 equal to 10 ( @xmath32 )  considered typical of cepheids in @xcite  together with the values chosen for the other parameters assure the turbulent stability and the secular stability for @xmath21 and @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the values of these parameters were arbitrarily chosen by @xcite and lead to the existence of a pulsationally unstable region ( `` strip '' ) for values of @xmath36 . from a mathematical point of view , we refer to such a behavior as having a limit cycle born through a hopf bifurcation .",
    "the stability analysis in @xcite was hampered by the fact that individual models were integrated only for a small number of dynamical time scales . in particular , our calculations show that for these cases , no limit - cycle stability exists .",
    "note also that @xcite analyzed only the cases for @xmath21 and @xmath37 , and that an exhaustive study of the dependence of the limit - cycle behavior on the input parameters remained to be performed .    in the current investigation , we have first undertaken a thorough study of the dynamics in the @xmath38 plane for @xmath21 and @xmath39 and for different values of the convective - radiative splitting , @xmath25 , following the assumption of radiative - dominated energy transport ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we have used the same form factor ( @xmath41 ) and the same initial condition @xmath42 adopted by @xcite .",
    "we have furthermore assumed that a case is pulsationally unstable ( limit - cycle behavior ) when two consecutive maxima in radius variations differ by less than @xmath43 , and pulsationally stable ( damping oscillations ) when the solution asymptotically approaches the fixed point @xmath44 and its distance to the fixed point becomes smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "the solution has been considered to be vibrationally unstable when the rapidly increasing dimensionless radius amplitude became larger than 15 .",
    "these thresholds are reasonable values .",
    "moreover , we have also verified that the resultant qualitative dynamics does not depend on the choice of these values .",
    "of course , one could use as well the asymptotic perturbation theory to compute the properties of the limit cycle .",
    "nevertheless , such an approach is beyond the aims of the current investigation and we consider it as a future line of work . for a better understanding of our results ,",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ f01 ] the three types of dynamical behavior we have identified .",
    "the top panel shows an example of pulsational stability , i.e. , the initial perturbation decays .",
    "the bottom panel shows a vibrationally unstable model ( the initial perturbation grows ) , while the middle panel shows the time series of a case that approaches a limit - cycle stability ( pulsational instability ) .",
    "note that for small amplitudes ( @xmath46 ) the case plotted in the bottom panel seems to approach a limit cycle , but for @xmath47 it becomes clear that the amplitudes are steadily increasing .",
    "this finding further strengthens the need for long time integrations to assess the type of stability for the individual one - zone models . as a final comment on the numerical assumptions considered in the present work , it is worth mentioning that the dynamical behavior of the system is independent of the initial condition , provided that it belongs to the neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we did not investigate the dependence of the characteristics of the time - series on initial conditions .",
    "one - zone models can be adopted to perform only a qualitative comparison with pulsation properties of variable stars . moreover ,",
    "this comparison is limited to observables that one - zone models can account for .",
    "in particular , the shape of light and velocity curves  originally suggested for rr lyrae stars by @xcite  and the occurrence of first overtone pulsators ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most interesting results disclosed by our simulations are presented in fig .",
    "[ f02]_a  e _ , where the regions of damped oscillations are shown in grey , the regions where the radial displacements approach a limit cycle are marked in black , while vibrationally unstable cases are shown in white . a glance at the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ f02 ] discloses that , with the exception of the case in which @xmath49 , an increase in @xmath25 causes a decrease in the region of pulsationally unstable cases and that for @xmath50 it vanishes .",
    "these findings support the results originally obtained by @xcite concerning the damping role of convection .",
    "in addition to the radius @xmath51 and velocity @xmath52 curves chosen to be illustrated in @xcite , we have added the light @xmath53 curve and in several occasions the temperature @xmath54 variations , estimated according to    @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes the stellar luminosity while the subscripts `` r '' and `` c '' refer to the radiative and convective component , respectively , as they result from @xcite .",
    "[ f03 ] shows the light curve , @xmath53 , the radius @xmath51 , and velocity @xmath52 time series for selected cases that approach limit cycle .",
    "note that to improve the visualization of data plotted in fig .",
    "[ f03 ] , we subtracted from the integration time , @xmath9 , the time interval spent by individual models to approach the limit cycle stability .",
    "we have chosen to illustrate cases at fixed @xmath57 and @xmath33 values , and @xmath21 ranging from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , being typical examples of the qualitative dynamics encountered .",
    "the time series plotted in this figure show that the cases characterized by parameters located close to the edge of the pulsational stability region ( grey area in fig .",
    "[ f02 ] ) present small amplitudes and sinusoidal changes ( panel _ a _ ) .",
    "these features are quite similar to the behavior that nonlinear , convective models show close to the blue edge of the instability strip  see , e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand , models that are located across the pulsationally unstable region",
    "( panels _ b , c _ ) show a bump along the rising branch of the luminosity curve .",
    "our calculations reveal that such a feature is due to the sharp increase in the efficiency of the convective motions , close to the phase of minimum radius .",
    "this finding is also found in nonlinear hydrodynamical models .",
    "one can notice that for cases located close to the vibrationally unstable region , the bump becomes very narrow ( panel _ d _ ) and pulse - like ( panel _ e _ ) .",
    "this is a behavior that is not observed in actual cepheids and it is not supported by nonlinear , convective models .",
    "this indicates the limit of the crude physical and numerical approximations adopted to construct our models .",
    "however , our analysis suggests that the limit - cycle behavior of these one - zone models in the pulsationally unstable region mimics the behavior of the classical cepheids instability strip , as argued in the original paper of @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the period of the oscillations of the cases plotted in fig .",
    "3 is not unity , even if the dynamical timescale was normalized to unity .",
    "this strong nonlinear effect on the period was already noted by @xcite , and he suggested that it was due to a correlation with the pulsation amplitude ( see also @xcite ) .      in this section",
    ", we present the results concerning the impact of the shell thickness on the existence of a limit - cycle behavior and on its characteristics . according to classical physical arguments",
    ", pulsational models only account for the envelope of variable stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "they include a damping , adiabatic region that is typically located on top of the nuclear burning region ( core ) , a transition region , a driving , nonadiabatic region , and the outermost layers ( surface ) .",
    "the driving region is the envelope zone where key elements ( hydrogen , helium , metals ) are partially ionized and supply , via the @xmath60- and/or the @xmath31-mechanism , the pulsation destabilization . in this theoretical framework ,",
    "the base of the envelope in nonlinear , hydrodynamical models is typically located at a few percents of the total radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "as far as the one - zone - model approach is concerned , different assumptions have been adopted in the literature .",
    "the one - zone model suggested by @xcite for mira variables accounts for a driving region ( piston approximation ) at @xmath61 , a transition region through which the pressure waves from the interior propagate , and a dissipation region that they call mantle . on the other hand , the one - zone model of @xcite for variable stars in the cepheid instability strip accounts for a driving convective region located at @xmath62 on top of a damping , adiabatic region ( _ rigid core _ ) . in this theoretical framework ,",
    "the pulsation destabilization is provided by a driving agent ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the two different assumptions describe the same envelope region if the _",
    "rigid core _ , assumed by @xcite is the outer boundary of the damping region .",
    "therefore , the _ shell thickness _",
    ", @xmath64 in dimensionless formulation , is the radial extent of the region located above the boundary between the damping ( adiabatic ) and the driving ( nonadiabatic ) region .    to investigate the dependence of the dynamic behavior of the system given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsystem ] ) on the shell thickness , we have chosen two values of the shell thickness , one smaller and the other larger than the value adopted in @xcite : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ f04 ] and fig .",
    "[ f05 ] the behaviors in the ( @xmath67)-plane for @xmath68 .",
    "one can notice that the increase in the shell thickness ( decrease of @xmath69 ) leads to the existence of pulsational instability for cases characterized by stronger convection ( higher values of @xmath57 ) .",
    "this effect is expected , because a decrease in @xmath69 implies an increase in the extent of the driving region .",
    "moreover , we have noted that for a fixed value of @xmath25 and different values of @xmath69 , the period distribution of the cases that approach a stable limit cycle peaks at shorter periods as the shell thickness decreases .",
    "this behavior is also expected , since detailed nonlinear , hydrodynamical models of rr lyrae ( @xcite ) and classical cepheids ( @xcite ) suggest that the regions located below the nodal line supply a small contribution to the work integral of first overtone pulsators .",
    "this supports the suggestion by @xcite to decrease the shell thickness of one - zone models to mimic the dynamical behavior of overtone pulsators .",
    "convection affects pulsation through three factors , namely convective energy transfer ( thermodynamic coupling ) , turbulent pressure , and turbulent viscosity ( dynamic coupling ) .",
    "the effect of turbulent viscosity is to convert the kinetic energy of radial motions into thermal energy by means of a turbulent cascade of smaller and smaller turbulent eddies .",
    "this means that the turbulent viscosity is a pure damping factor ( @xcite ) .",
    "the role that turbulent pressure plays in driving or damping the pulsation is not straightforward , since the contributions of gas and turbulent pressure can not be easily separated .",
    "linear ( @xcite ) and nonlinear ( @xcite ) convective models of classical cepheids suggest that the work done by turbulent pressure attains both positive ( driving ) and negative ( damping ) values in different regions of the envelope .",
    "linear and nonlinear , convective lpv models constructed by @xcite and by @xcite indicate that turbulent pressure is a driving mechanism , whereas more recent calculations by @xcite support the evidence that it is a damping mechanism .    the turbulent pressure , @xmath70 , was not included in the original one - zone model by @xcite , but it was shortly mentioned as being    @xmath71    where the zero subscript denotes its equilibrium value . in this section , we present the results obtained by the introduction of the turbulent pressure .",
    "the reader interested in a detailed description of the physical assumptions adopted to include the turbulent pressure term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsystem ] ) is referred to appendix a. the new dynamic system becomes now :    @xmath72    we have undertaken a parametric study in order to investigate the influence of the turbulent pressure on the overall dynamics of the system and implicitly on the existence of limit cycles . for this purpose , we have chosen the same initial condition as in  2 , that is @xmath73 , which led to a value of @xmath74 .",
    "the results concerning the plane @xmath75 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f06 ] , using the color code from fig .",
    "the regions characterized by the existence of limit cycles for @xmath76 are more extended than in the case without turbulent pressure , as expected because the additional pressure adds to the driving mechanism .",
    "we have also investigated the light and velocity curves for the cases characterized by limit - cycle behavior . from the hydrodynamical models as well as from plain physical arguments on the existence of the cepheid instability strip",
    ", it is expected that by crossing the instability strip from the blue to the red edge , the period increases and the amplitude of the oscillations quickly reaches its maximum and then slowly decreases . in order to obtain a similar evolution of the amplitude from this one - zone model , the limit - cycle region",
    "must be bounded in the @xmath77-plane by pulsationally stable regions both to the left ( low values of @xmath24 ) and to the right ( high values of @xmath24 ) .",
    "if bounded by a vibrationally unstable region , the oscillations which result from using parameters close to this boundary are pulse - like and the amplitude is large , as in fig .  [ f03]_e_. one can notice that for the case of zero - turbulence pressure , the limit - cycle region is bounded to the left by the vibrationally unstable behavior and thus the above condition is not satisfied .",
    "however , with the introduction of the turbulent pressure , there exists a case for which the limit - cycle region is bounded in the @xmath75-plane both to the left and to the right by the pulsationally stable behavior ( fig .",
    "[ f06]_d _ ) . for this case",
    ", we present in fig .",
    "[ f07 ] the types of light and velocity curves obtained in the transition from the hot ( blue , low @xmath24 ) to the cool ( red , high @xmath78 ) edge , at constant @xmath21 .",
    "one can notice that the amplitude has a peak toward the center of the limit - cycle region and then it decreases .",
    "moreover and even more importantly , data plotted in fig .  [ f07 ] disclose that one - zone models that account for turbulent pressure do not present , in this region of the parameter space , the spurious secondary peak along the rising branch .",
    "the morphology of light and velocity curves plotted in this figure are in qualitative agreement with actual classical cepheids and with nonlinear , convective models .",
    "@xcite remarked a paradox of the present one - zone model : _ although the convection tends to stabilize the pulsation in the majority of cases , the completely convective case shows instability in every criterion_. we have verified that indeed the present model with fully convective ( @xmath79 ) thick shell ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) presents vibrational instability for any @xmath21 , @xmath82 .",
    "however , for a thin shell , our simulations revealed that while no limit - cycle regions exist for the cases with @xmath83 and @xmath84 $ ] , limit - cycle models exist for the case of fully convective shells .",
    "[ f08]_a _ shows the ( @xmath85)-plane for @xmath86 , @xmath32 and without turbulent pressure .",
    "although the current analysis relies on simple one - zone models , this is a very interesting finding and we are tempted to attribute this region of the plane @xmath87 to the instability strip of lpvs  variable red giants and supergiants  which are thought to be significantly nonadiabatic and highly convective .",
    "there is general agreement within the astrophysical community that the intrinsic reason for the existence of the red edge of the cepheid instability strip is the damping produced by convection .",
    "however , theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that convection might also be a destabilizing mechanism in the cool region of the hr diagram ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the convective time scale is much longer than the dynamical time scale ( @xmath88 ) , the effect of convection is stabilizing , but when the convective time scale is much shorter , the reverse is true ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it may provide an important driving mechanism in red giants and supergiants .",
    "more exactly , the convective luminosity in the ionization regions of red pulsating variables is expected to exceed 99% of the total luminosity , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "they identify a mira instability strip outside the cepheid instability strip when pulsation - convection interaction is taken into account .    to investigate the effect of the turbulent pressure in the case of a completely convective shell",
    ", we have identified in the ( @xmath67)-plane the regions characterized by limit - cycle behavior .",
    "we illustrate the results in fig .",
    "[ f08]_b_. the region of limit cycles for the completely convective case persists when the turbulent pressure is introduced .",
    "compared to the cases with no turbulent pressure , this region shifts to smaller values of the convective efficiency , @xmath24 .",
    "this shift is due to the fact that the minimal perturbation strength necessary to drive the pulsational instability is achieved at weaker convective driving ( smaller @xmath24 ) , as the rest of the driving is now provided by the turbulent pressure .    before verifying that convection is the driving agent for the completely convective shell , we briefly describe the pulsation characteristics of the models constructed by adopting @xmath89 and compare them with the previously discussed limit cycles .",
    "for comparative purposes , fig .",
    "[ f08]_c _ shows the time series of a `` cepheid '' ( @xmath90 ) , and of a `` lpv '' model ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the increase both in period and amplitude observed in this figure when passing from a `` cepheid''-like to a `` lpv''-like supports the previous working hypothesis . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that `` cepheid''-like pulsators show the well - known phase - lag between the light and the velocity curve .",
    "the pulsation behavior of the `` lpv''-like model needs to be discussed in more detail .",
    "the data plotted in the top and in the bottom panel show a very small phase lag between the light and the temperature changes .",
    "this evidence appears to be supported by infrared spectroscopic data ( @xcite ) of pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "however , the maximum in the light curve takes place before the minimum in the velocity curve .",
    "this finding is at odds with observational data for mira and semiregular variables , since the minimum velocity is not correlated with light maxima ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison between theory and observations is hampered by the occurrence of long secondary periods ( @xcite ) , and indeed in a few objects the minimum in the velocity curve takes place later than the maximum in the velocity curve  @xmath91  oph , r  leo ( @xcite ) and s  lep ( @xcite ) . in passing",
    "we would also like to draw the attention on the correlation between light maxima and convective velocity , since the maximum takes place just before maximum light .",
    "we are not aware of macroturbulent velocity measurements in lpvs , and new observations would be very useful to constrain the plausibility of the physical assumptions adopted in simple one - zone convective models .    for completeness",
    ", we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ f09 ] the time behavior of a model located close to the vibrational instability edge after approaching to limit - cycle stability .",
    "this example is generic for all the cases with or without the turbulent pressure close to the vibrational - instability edge for the completely convective shell .",
    "the data plotted in this figure show a well - defined bump along the decreasing branch of the light curve .",
    "this bump becomes more pronounced as the values of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath24 approach the vibrational - instability edge , while the peak of the luminosity becomes a pulse - like feature .",
    "the occurrence of such secondary features is quite typical along the light curves of miras ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of the luminosity maximum appears strongly correlated with the variation of the convective velocity ( @xmath6 ) , while the bump is in phase with the change of the radial velocity ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "similar to the limit cycles for the weakly convective cases associated to the classical cepheids , it is highly speculative to attribute specific values of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath24 to different types of lpvs .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the parameter space is mandatory to pinpoint the pulsation properties of completely convective one - zone models that mimic an `` rgb''-like or a `` mira''-like behavior .      as a natural further step into clarifying the origin of the pulsationally unstable cases for the completely convective shell",
    ", we have investigated the role of the adiabatic exponent , @xmath13 , as driving agent . from the mathematical perspective of the model",
    ", the question resides into establishing the relative effect on the system dynamics of the parameter @xmath23 , on one hand , and of the parameter @xmath13 , on the other hand , included in the definition of the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the case of completely convective shell translates for this one - zone model into the disappearance of the @xmath60-mechanism , with the driving being supplied only by the @xmath31-mechanism . to test whether the pulsational instability of our convective models is due to the @xmath31-mechanism or to a convection - induced driving mechanism",
    ", we studied the evolution of the limit - cycle region in the ( @xmath67)-plane as @xmath13 is varied .",
    "the results obtained so far have used the value @xmath30 as the one employed by @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that if the obtained cases of self - sustained oscillations are a product of convection - induced driving , then the @xmath31-mechanism has very little , if any , influence on their properties .",
    "[ f10]_a _ and _ b _ display two cases of different shell thickness concluding , as in @xmath95 , that a thicker shell implies a wider range of parameters leading to pulsational instability . in the completely convective case ,",
    "this increase causes a shift of the limit - cycle region to lower @xmath24 .",
    "the same shift occurs by increasing the @xmath13 value at constant shell thickness , or , in other words , by decreasing the efficiency of the @xmath31-mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ f10]_b , c , d _ ) .",
    "this means that convection and turbulent pressure are driving mechanisms for fully convective models , since the region where these models display a limit cycle stability marginally depends on the adopted @xmath13 value .",
    "this finding supports the theoretical predictions by @xcite concerning the driving provided by the coupling between pulsation and convection , but we also find that turbulent pressure is a destabilizing mechanism instead of a damping factor for pulsation . however , current models assume that the physical properties of the driving region can be described by a kramers opacity law and by a very crude equation of state . therefore , there is no guarantee that current models properly account for the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the different partial ionization zones in low density envelope regions .",
    "in this paper we have thoroughly analyzed the one - zone convective model introduced by @xcite .",
    "the model appears in the form of a system of 4 ordinary differential equations where the variables are the radius of the shell , the velocity , the pressure and the convective velocity .",
    "the nonadiabaticity resides in the pressure which is considered as a nonadiabatic perturbation of the reference pressure and , thus , can be considered as a nonadiabatic variable of the system .",
    "the model accounts for the self - excited oscillations by adopting a value for the adiabatic exponent , @xmath13 , close to unity .",
    "the main parameters of the system are the fraction @xmath25 of convective luminosity with respect to the total luminosity , and the time - scales ratios , @xmath21 and @xmath24 , which are a measure of the dynamical time scale to the thermal time scale and to the convective time scale , respectively .",
    "we have extended the model by considering explicitly the role of the turbulent pressure and the case of completely convective shell .",
    "the one - zone models constructed by @xcite were integrated only for a few dynamical time scales and , therefore , the approach to limit - cycle stability remained still to be investigated . to properly identify the region of the parameter space which shows a limit - cycle behavior ( pulsational instability ) ,",
    "we have selected a parametric space given by @xmath96 , @xmath21 and @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "our parametric study revealed well - defined regions where limit cycles exist , born through the hopf bifurcation . for a typical shell thickness of 11% ,",
    "pulsational instability was encountered only for the radiation - dominated cases ( @xmath98 ) , while the increase in the shell thickness displaces this limit to upper values of @xmath23 .",
    "the existence of these upper values supports the work by @xcite and further strengthens the role played by convection as a damping mechanism .",
    "moreover , we found that the shell thickness is , as expected , positively correlated with the period distribution of pulsationally unstable cases .",
    "interestingly enough , models constructed by adopting thick and thin shells obey different pl relations that mimic the behavior of fundamental and first overtone cepheids .    additionally , we have undertaken a parametric study to investigate the influence of the turbulent pressure on the overall dynamics of the system and implicitly on the existence of limit cycles .",
    "the turbulent pressure appears to be a driving mechanism as the regions where the models approach a limit - cycle stability are more extended than for models that do not account for the turbulent pressure .",
    "moreover and even more importantly , we find that one - zone models that account for turbulent pressure do not show a spurious peak along the rising branch of light curves .",
    "the inclusion of this term is also supported by the occurrence in the ( @xmath67)-plane of a pulsationally unstable region bounded to the left and to the right by two pulsationally stable regions , as expected from physical considerations and hydrodynamical models . moreover",
    ", the models located in this region display a morphology of the light curves and the velocity time series quite similar to those of nonlinear , hydrodynamical models and actual cepheids .    as a natural continuation of the work by @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the vibrational and pulsational stability of completely convective models .",
    "our predictions disclose a well - defined region of the parameter space where these red models approach a limit - cycle stability .",
    "the turbulent pressure appears to be a driving mechanism , a finding that supports the results original brought forward by @xcite and @xcite on the basis of both linear and nonlinear lpv models , but at odds with predictions based on linear , convective models provided by @xcite .",
    "we computed several sequences of models by adopting different values of the adiabatic exponent and of the shell thickness .",
    "we found in agreement with @xcite that the coupling between pulsation and convection is the key physical mechanism that drives the pulsation instability in these simple structures .",
    "we have also performed a qualitative comparison with empirical properties of lpvs .",
    "we have found some similarities , but only one feature partially agrees with empirical data : the maximum in the light curve is not correlated with the minimum in the velocity curve .",
    "however , the comparison with observations might be hampered by the occurrence of long secondary periods .",
    "we are not aware of detailed measurements of macroturbulent velocity along the pulsation cycle of lpvs , however our models suggest that the maximum in the light curve takes place soon after the maximum in the convective velocity .",
    "current one - zone models account for the coupling between convection and pulsation and for turbulent pressure .",
    "we investigated the sensitivity to free parameters and to the physical assumptions adopted to construct the models .",
    "however , the treatment and the inclusion of these physical ingredients rely on crude physical approximations .",
    "a more detailed investigation is required before we can assess whether our current theoretical framework might mimic the complex pulsation behavior of lpvs and this implies the use of the asymptotic perturbation theory to compute analytically the properties of the limit cycle .",
    "the pulsational behavior disclosed by these simple models for fully convective models will be addressed in a forthcoming paper on the basis of nonlinear , hydrodynamical models ( munteanu et al .",
