    "debris discs are believed to arise from planetesimals colliding and producing a cascade of dust grains , which reprocess the starlight into infrared emission @xcite .",
    "while infrared and sub - mm observations yield reasonable estimates for the dust mass , estimating the _ disc mass _ is generally challenging because the planetesimals can not be detected via conventional methods @xcite .",
    "of the hundreds of debris discs studied , the one residing in hd 69830 stands out because the system also hosts three exoplanets with neptune - like minimum masses @xcite .",
    "steady state models using a narrow interpretation of the disc properties infer that the infrared emission is anomalously bright , which implies that we may be observing hd 69830 at a special time in its evolution  it is a  transient \" debris disc fed by a recent , violent collision between planetesimals @xcite .",
    "@xcite reach a more subdued conclusion : based on the discovery of icy dust grains within the debris disc , they remark that the dust was either produced within the last year ( relative to the time their observations were taken ) or was being continuously replenished by planetesimal collisions .    in this study , we offer an alternative , plausible perspective : as the stellar / disc age ( assuming they are the same ) is uncertain , it is possible to still interpret the disc emission as being non - transient . in this case , the old age of the disc becomes a friend and not a foe , because the possible values for the disc mass become severely restricted by both dynamical and observational constraints .",
    "in particular , we show that the disc in hd 69830 is several times more massive than the asteroid belt in our solar system . in  [ sect : obs ] , we review the observational constraints on the hd 69830 system . in  [ sect : models ] , we apply dynamical survival models to the system .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications of our study in  [",
    "sect : discussion ] , including the main model uncertainties .",
    "the key aim is to meaningfully restrict the parameter space of our models using observational constraints .",
    "therefore , we begin by reviewing the existing observational constraints found in the literature . located 12.6 pc away , the hd 69830 star has a spectral type k0v , an effective temperature @xmath3 k and a luminosity @xmath4 @xcite . by using theoretical evolutionary tracks , @xcite derived a stellar mass of @xmath5 .",
    "high precision radial velocity measurements using the harps spectrograph placed the exoplanets hd 69830b  d at semi - major axes of @xmath6 , 0.186 and 0.630 , respectively @xcite . the corresponding minimum masses are @xmath7 , 11.8 and 18.1 earth masses , where @xmath8 denotes the inclination of the system ( assuming co - planar orbits ) .",
    "infrared excesses at 12 , 23.7 and 25 @xmath9 m were detected in hd 69830 ; the optical depth ( covering fraction ) of the associated dust grains was inferred to be @xmath10 , more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than for the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of an infrared excess at 70 @xmath9 m implies that the dust grains predominantly have sizes smaller than 70 @xmath9m@xmath11 m .",
    "the strong mineralogical features detected in the spectrum from 835 @xmath9 m further argues for small grain sizes @xcite , which rules out the possibility of the infrared excess being due to a dynamically warm disc ( with particle sizes @xmath12 m ; @xcite ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the infrared spectral energy distribution yielded semi - major axes of @xmath131.16 au @xcite .",
    "constraints from mid - infrared interferometry place an upper limit of 2.4 au on the disc size @xcite .",
    "these estimates for @xmath14 are consistent with stability analyses which suggest that planetesimals may exist at @xmath151.2 au @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt a conservative range of semi - major axes for the disc of @xmath151.3 au . au . ]    the most uncertain parameter in the system is the stellar age @xmath16 .",
    "ages of @xmath175 gyr have been claimed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite favour @xmath18 gyr ( see their table 1 ) ; in tandem with assuming a single value of @xmath19 au , as well as fixed values for the parameters describing the planetesimals , they concluded that the infrared emission due to dust exceeds its steady state value , thereby qualifying it as a  transient \" ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of planetary systems from first principles is a challenging task fraught with theoretical uncertainties  these challenges are present for any formation model of the hd 69830 system @xcite . since our main interest is in estimating the disc mass , a simpler approach is to construct a _ survival _ model with the reasoning that any observed disc must have survived all dynamical processes , including gravitational instability , dynamical chaos , gravitational scattering , physical collisions and radiation forces that would lead to significant evolution over its lifetime @xcite . from a dynamical viewpoint",
    ", discs may be classified as being dynamically hot , warm or cold .",
    "only dynamically hot discs are capable of producing a collisional cascade of dust grains .",
    "collision - limited discs are a special sub - class of dynamically hot discs , where the collisional time scale is equal to the disc age .",
    "dynamical survival models are relatively simple and may be described mainly by five parameters : the disc mass @xmath20 , the disc semi - major axis @xmath14 , planetesimal size @xmath21 , planetesimal radial velocity dispersion @xmath22 and the stellar / disc age @xmath16 .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath22 is in turn directly related to the root mean square eccentricity of the planetesimal orbits @xcite .",
    "since observational constraints exist for @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( see  [ sect : obs ] ) , we may thus use the models to constrain the allowed parameter space for the other three parameters .",
    "( the stellar mass @xmath23 , luminosity @xmath24 and radius @xmath25 enter as minor parameters and are also fixed by the observations . ) additionally , an important constraint is provided by the observed dust optical depth @xmath26 ( see  [ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "we permit only disc models with a theoretically calculated dust optical depth @xmath27 which satisfies the condition , @xmath28 the dimensionless quantity @xmath29 allows for the uncertainties associated with our survival models , since the computed value of @xmath27 depends on @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "smaller values of @xmath29 lead to narrower ranges of estimates for the disc mass .",
    "we choose to be conservative and adopt @xmath30 such that the computed dust optical depth varies by a factor @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : survival ] shows the range of possible disc masses @xmath20 and the corresponding number of planetesimals in the disc @xmath32 as functions of @xmath16 .",
    "these diagrams were constructed by first considering a wide range of values for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 via a monte carlo approach . for each",
    "randomly generated trio of parameters , a list of dynamical conditions were checked , as described in detail in @xcite . the condition in equation ( [ eq : tau ] )",
    "was also checked . only the discs which satisfy all of these conditions",
    "are retained .    ; shaded regions ) , both as a function of the inclination angle @xmath8 . ]",
    "a few features of figure [ fig : survival ] are worth pointing out .",
    "firstly , @xmath20 and @xmath32 are essentially unconstrained if the disc is allowed to be much younger than the star ( e.g. , as suggested by @xcite ) . for young disc ages ,",
    "the enormous allowed range of values for @xmath32 reflects the fact that a disc of mass @xmath20 may be configured into a large variety of different planetesimal masses which still satisfy both the dynamical and observational constraints .",
    "in other words , the disc mass and observed infrared emission from dust grains are degenerate quantities . secondly ,",
    "if we allow the stellar / disc age to be @xmath0 gyr , then decent estimates for the disc mass and number of planetesimals are produced : @xmath33 curiously , @xcite extrapolated the inferred dust distribution to @xmath34100 km - sized planetesimals and inferred a disc mass @xmath35 .",
    "_ it is precisely because the disc is old and bright that the range of possibilities for its mass is limited .",
    "_    it is important to note that the approach of @xcite does not generally require @xmath36 for dynamically hot discs .",
    "for example , ",
    "3.2.1 of that paper describes a generalization of the criterion for the toomre stability of a disc ( which does assume a fluid treatment ) to discs where @xmath37 . in other words , while the dust grains are assumed to be in a collisional cascade , the planetesimals are not .",
    "it is reasonable to ask if any of the exoplanets in the hd 69830 system are capable of dynamically stirring the disc and thereby modifying the predicted dust content away from its steady state value .",
    "mutual gravitational interactions occur when two bodies are separated by less than about @xmath38 @xcite , where the mutual hill radius is defined as @xcite @xmath39 figure [ fig : schematic ] shows the spatial separations between hd 69830b  d and the disc , which we assume to extend from @xmath15 au to 1.3 au .",
    "it is apparent that hd 69830b and hd 69830c are located at separations greatly exceeding @xmath40 for non - zero values of the inclination . only for inclinations of @xmath41",
    "is hd 69830d capable of dynamically stirring the disc , which corresponds to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of jupiter .",
    "these values of @xmath8 are not ruled out by stability analyses of the planetary orbits @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the presence of hd 69830d may increase the radial velocity dispersion @xmath22 of the planetesimals in the disc and therefore increase the eccentricities of their orbits @xcite , implying that collisions between them will become more violent .",
    "non - intuitively , however , the collision _ rate _ either remains unchanged or _ decreases _ , since @xcite @xmath44 depending on whether the self - gravity of the planetesimals is important ( which is the case when the safronov number @xmath45 exceeds unity ) . for the values of @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath32 inferred from figure [ fig : survival ] , each of the planetesimals are @xmath4610 times the mass of ceres , with radii @xmath47 km , and most likely have @xmath48 .",
    "several mean motion resonances of the planetesimals with hd 69830d have already been identified by @xcite .",
    "specifically , the 2:1 resonance at @xmath49 au creates a zone of accumulation which allows the debris disc to survive .",
    "it is expected that the mean motion resonances will not substantially modify the dust production properties of the planetesimals away from the steady state model we have used in this study .    we conclude that our dynamical survival models give reasonable estimates for the disc mass if @xmath50 .",
    "using the existing observational constraints on the hd 69830 system , we have applied the dynamical survival models of @xcite to estimate the mass of the debris disc and find it to be several times more massive than the asteroid belt in our solar system ( @xmath51 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate hinges on being able to interpret the hd 69830 debris disc within the context of a steady state model , which is only possible if one adopts the lower range of stellar ages quoted for hd 69830 ( @xmath0 gyr ) .",
    "if one insists on interpreting the disc as being transient , then this mass estimate becomes an upper limit .",
    "the most uncertain piece of physics involved in the dynamical survival models concerns the collisions between the parent planetesimals responsible for dust production . the binding energy per unit mass of a planetesimal",
    "is typically described by the function @xcite , @xmath52,\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath14 and @xmath55 are parameters determined from a combination of simulations and laboratory experiments .",
    "the specification of the values for the indices @xmath14 and @xmath55 also allows the mass distribution of the planetesimals to be fixed @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we have adopted @xmath56 g , @xmath57 erg g@xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 by taking an average of the values assumed for ice and basalt , while being aware that they are somewhat uncertain .    in particular , the value of @xmath53 may vary by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "for example , decreasing @xmath53 to @xmath61 erg g@xmath58 results in similar estimates for @xmath20 ( equation [ [ eq : estimates ] ] ) , but only allows for discs with @xmath62 gyr to survive .",
    "the relative ease of breaking apart the planetesimals means that they are less likely to survive for a given time .",
    "if @xmath63 erg g@xmath58 , then we now have @xmath64 gyr , which is inconsistent with the lowest value of the stellar age quoted in the literature ( 0.6 gyr ; see  [ sect : obs ] ) .",
    "also , as @xmath53 decreases , the mass @xmath20 is distributed among a larger number @xmath32 of planetesimals . for comparison",
    ", we note that @xcite adopt a constant @xmath65 erg g@xmath58 .",
    "our estimates highlight the fact that whether the disc is transient depends on the assumed value for the binding energy of the planetesimals .",
    "this quantity in turn depends on the material composition of the planetesimals , for which we only have solar system asteroids and kuiper belt objects as a guide .    _",
