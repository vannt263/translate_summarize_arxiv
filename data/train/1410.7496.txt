    "in the past two decades , rapid advances in miniaturizing of computing , communication , sensing , and actuation have made it feasible to deploy a large number of autonomous agents to work cooperatively to accomplish civilian and military missions .",
    "this , compared to a single complex agent , has the capability to significantly improve the operational effectiveness , reduce the costs , and provide additional degrees of redundancy @xcite .",
    "having multiple autonomous agents to work together to achieve collective behaviors is usually referred to as cooperative control of multi - agent systems . due to its potential applications in various areas such as surveillance and reconnaissance systems , satellite formation flying , electric power systems , and intelligent transportation systems , cooperative control of multi - agent systems",
    "has received compelling attention from the systems and control community . in the area of cooperative control , consensus is an important and fundamental problem , which means that a group of agents reaches an agreement on certain quantity of interest by interacting with their local neighbors .",
    "advances of various consensus algorithms have been reported in a quite large body of research papers ; see @xcite and the references therein .    for a consensus control problem ,",
    "the main task is to design appropriate protocols to achieve consensus . due to the large number of agents ,",
    "limited sensing capability of sensors , and short wireless communication ranges , distributed control , depending only on local information of the agents and their neighbors , appears to be a promising tool for handling multi - agent systems .",
    "note that designing appropriate distributed protocols is generally a challenging task , especially for multi - agent systems with complex dynamics , due to the interplay of the agent dynamics , the communication graph among agents , and the cooperative control laws .",
    "take the consensus problem for multi - agent systems with general continuous - time linear dynamics for instance . in previous works",
    "@xcite , several static and dynamic consensus protocols based on the local state or output information of neighboring agents have been proposed .",
    "a common feature in the aforementioned existing papers is that the design of the consensus protocols needs to use some eigenvalue information of the laplacian matrix associated with the communication graph . actually , for the simply case with second - order integrator agent dynamics , the design of the consensus protocols does rely on the smallest real part of the nonzero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xcite .",
    "however , the smallest real part of the nonzero eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix is global information of the communication graph , because every agent has to know the whole communication graph to compute it .",
    "therefore , the consensus protocols in the aforementioned works can not be designed by the agents in a fully distributed way , i.e. , relying on only the local information of neighboring agents . to avoid this limitation , two types of distributed adaptive consensus protocols",
    "are proposed in @xcite , which implement adaptive laws to dynamically update the coupling weights of neighboring agents .",
    "similar adaptive schemes are presented in @xcite to achieve consensus for multi - agent systems with second - order nonlinear dynamics .",
    "note that the adaptive protocols in @xcite are applicable to only undirected communication graphs or leader - follower graphs where the subgraph among followers is undirected . because of the asymmetry of the laplacian matrices of directed graphs , designing fully distributed adaptive consensus protocols for general directed graphs is more much challenging . by introducing monotonically increasing functions to provide additional freedom for design ,",
    "a distributed adaptive consensus protocol is constructed in @xcite to achieve leader - follower consensus for the communication graphs containing a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root node .",
    "similar adaptive protocols for directed graphs are developed in @xcite for the special case where the agents are described by double integrators . even though the aforementioned advances have been reported on designing distributed adaptive protocols for general linear multi - agent systems with directed graphs ,",
    "there are still many important open problems awaiting further investigation . for instance , to design distributed adaptive protocols for the case of general directed graphs without a leader , to examine the robustness issue associated with the adaptive protocols , and to propose distributed dynamic adaptive protocols for the case where only local output information is available , to name just a few .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to address the first two aforementioned problems .",
    "specifically , we address the distributed adaptive consensus protocol design problem for general linear multi - agent systems with directed graphs and external disturbances .",
    "we consider both the cases where the communication graph among the agents is strongly connected and contains a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root . for the case with leader - follower graphs containing a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root , we revisit the distributed adaptive protocol in @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that in the presence of external disturbances , the adaptive gains of the adaptive protocol in @xcite will slowly grow to infinity , which is the well - known parameter drift phenomenon in the adaptive control literature @xcite . to deal with this instability issue associated with the adaptive protocol in @xcite , we propose a novel distributed adaptive consensus protocol , by using @xmath0 modification technique @xcite .",
    "this novel adaptive protocol is designed in fully distributed fashion to ensure the ultimate boundedness of both the consensus error and the adaptive coupling gains .",
    "that is , the proposed adaptive protocol is robust in the presence of external disturbances .",
    "the upper bound of the consensus error is also explicitly given .",
    "the case with strongly connected communication graphs is further studied .",
    "a distributed robust adaptive protocol is also presented , which can guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the consensus error and the adaptive coupling gains in the presence of external disturbances .",
    "a sufficient condition for the existence of the adaptive protocols proposed in this paper is that each agent is stabilizable .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "mathematical preliminaries required in this paper is summarized in section 2 . distributed robust adaptive consensus protocols are presented in sections 3 and 4 for multi - agent systems with strongly connected graphs and directed leader - follower graphs , respectively .",
    "simulation examples are presented for illustration in section 5 .",
