    "<S> we study large @xmath2 systems and find , in general , that @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for a short range system frustrated by a general competing long range interaction , the crossover temperature @xmath0 veers towards the critical temperature of the unfrustrated short range system ( i.e. , that in which the frustrating long range interaction is removed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discover in systems with long range interactions the existence of at least one diverging correlation length in the high temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> when screening is present , instead of diverging , this correlation length tends , at high temperatures to the screening length . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that apart from certain special crossover points , the total number of correlation and modulation lengths remains conserved . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an expression for the change in modulation length with temperature for a general system near the ground state with a ferromagnetic interaction and an opposing long range interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate that the correlation functions associated with the exact dipolar interactions differ substantially from those in which a scalar product form between the dipoles is assumed . </S>"
