    "dwarf galaxies are thought to be the building blocks in the assembly of more massive galaxies within the hierarchical picture of structure formation .",
    "these galaxies are also very important venues in which questions about cosmology , galaxy evolution , and star formation may be answered .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies are relatively low - mass , gas - rich , metal - poor , and are presently forming stars as shown by their regions , whereas low - mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gas - poor and no longer host present - day star - forming events",
    ". the properties of these galaxies may be similar to those found in the early universe , and dwarf irregulars may possibly be sites out of which damped lyman-@xmath7 absorber systems form at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important question which has yet to be fully explained is the relationship between dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "that streams have been observed within the galaxy and m  31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) has been taken as evidence of ongoing accretion and of representing past merging of dwarfs by the more massive galaxies .",
    "however , work presented by @xcite and @xcite have shown that stars in present - day dwarf spheroidals can not make up the dominant stellar populations in the halo , bulge , or the thick disk of the galaxy , although the merging of dwarf galaxies at very early times can not be ruled out .",
    "the measurements of element abundances provide important clues to understanding the chemical history and evolution of galaxies . in star - forming dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the analysis of bright nebular emission lines from the spectra of  regions is used to derive abundances of @xmath7-elements ( i.e. , oxygen ) in the ionized gas ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", a limited number of elements can be studied by comparison to the number of elements found in the absorption spectra of stars . for a more complete picture , additional elements",
    "should be included , since various elements arise from different sites and involve different timescales .",
    "oxygen and other @xmath7-elements are created in very massive progenitor stars before being returned to the interstellar medium ( ism ) on short timescales , when these stars explode as type ii supernovae .",
    "iron is an element produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in type  i supernovae from low - mass progenitor stars on longer timescales , and is also produced in type  ii supernovae . because of the varying timescales for stars of different masses , the @xmath7 element - to - iron abundance ratio , [ @xmath7/fe ] , = log(x / y ) @xmath8 log(x / y)@xmath9 . ]",
    "is tied very strongly with the star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , [ @xmath7/fe ] values for three dwarf irregular galaxies are near or at solar , which indicates that stars have been forming at a very low rate and/or the last burst of star formation occurred long ago @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim that o / fe is elevated in low metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies ( [ o / fe ] = @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , their analysis does not account for potential depletion of fe onto dust grains , and the fe abundance is only measured in fe@xmath11 , requiring very large and uncertain ionization correction factors ( icfs ) .",
    "@xcite finds that the adopted icfs underestimate the total fe abundance by factors larger than the elevated abundance ratio claimed by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is prudent to assume that the nebular fe abundances in these galaxies , and thus the nebular o / fe ratios , are quite uncertain @xcite . at present",
    ", reliable o / fe ratios will need to be obtained from stellar abundances . while a complete discussion of @xmath7/fe values is beyond the scope of the present work , brief reviews of stellar abundances in external galaxies",
    "have recently been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "high efficiency spectrographs on 8- and 10-m telescopes have made possible the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars in extragalactic systems .",
    "in particular , bright blue supergiants have been observed in galaxies at distances of about 1  mpc .",
    "these hot young massive stars allow us to measure simultaneously present - day @xmath7- and iron - group elements .",
    "the important advantage of these measurements also allow for the direct comparison of stellar @xmath7-element abundances with nebular measurements , as massive stars and nebulae are similar in age and have similar formation sites .",
    "oxygen abundances derived from the spectroscopy of blue supergiants have been obtained in nearby dwarf irregular galaxies ngc  6822 , wlm , and sextans  a @xcite .",
    "the relative ease with which spectra of  regions have been obtained in dwarf irregular galaxies has led to establishing : ( 1 ) the metallicity - luminosity relation , thought to be representative of a mass - metallicity relation for dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and ( 2 ) the metallicity - gas fraction relation , which represents the relative conversion of gas into stars , and may be strongly affected by the galaxies surrounding environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that nebular oxygen abundances are representative of the present - day ism metallicity for an entire dwarf galaxy , where there is often only a single  region present .",
    "in fact , spatial inhomogeneities or radial gradients in oxygen abundances have been found to be very small or negligible in nearby dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although recent observations have cast uncertainty about the assumption in ngc  6822 and wlm @xcite .",
    "here we will focus on oxygen abundances , and the comparison between stellar and nebular determinations .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we adopt 12@xmath0log(o / h ) = 8.66 as the solar value for the oxygen abundance @xcite .      wlm ( wolf - lundmark - melotte ) is a dwarf irregular galaxy at a distance of 0.95  mpc @xcite and is located in the local group .",
    "the galaxy was discovered by @xcite , and independently rediscovered by lundmark and melotte @xcite .",
    "wlm is relatively isolated , as the nearest neighbor about 175  kpc distant is the recently discovered cetus dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite .",

    "@xcite presented  velocity fields for the brightest  regions in wlm , and showed that the southern  ring is expanding at a speed of 20 km  s@xmath12 and that the kinetic age of the bubble is 4.5  myr .",
    "recent studies of the resolved stellar populations with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) have been carried out by @xcite with the wide field planetary camera  2 and by @xcite with the space telescope imaging spectrograph .",
    "@xcite found that over half of the stars were formed about 9  gyr ago , and that a recent burst of star formation has mostly occurred in the central bar of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite identified the horizontal branch , also confirming the presence of a very old stellar population . in the carbon star survey by @xcite , they found that wlm contained the largest fraction of carbon - to - m stars for the dwarf galaxies surveyed , and showed that wlm is an inclined disk galaxy with no evidence of an extended spherical stellar halo .",
    "@xcite searched for molecular gas in wlm , but only upper limits to the co intensity and subsequent h@xmath13 column densities were determined .",
    "recent 21-cm measurements with the australia telescope compact array have shown that there are two peaks in the  distribution , and that the measured  rotation curve is typical for a disk @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy of the brightest  regions were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting nebular oxygen abundances were found to be 12@xmath0log(o / h ) @xmath14 , or [ o / h ] @xmath15 . @xcite measured the chemical composition of two a - type supergiant stars in wlm , and showed that the mean stellar magnesium abundance was [ mg / h ] = @xmath5 . however , the oxygen abundance in one of the stars was [ o / h ] = @xmath6 , which is about 0.7 dex or almost five times larger than the nebular abundance .",
    "this presents a vexing question : how can the young supergiant be significantly more metal - rich than the surrounding ism from which the star was born ?",
    "the research reported here is part of a program to understand the chemical evolution from the youngest stellar populations in the nearest dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the motivations are : ( 1 ) to obtain a homogeneous sample of abundance measurements for regions presently known in wlm ; ( 2 ) to measure the temperature - sensitive  emission line , derive direct oxygen abundances , and compare the present set of measurements with those in the literature ; and ( 3 ) to examine whether the present measurements show any inhomogeneities in oxygen abundances across the galaxy .",

    "[ fig_oxymb ] shows the metallicity - luminosity relation for dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "we have followed fig .  10 from @xcite and plotted the present nebular result , the mean magnesium abundance from the two a - type supergiant stars , and the derived oxygen abundance for the supergiant wlm  15",
    ". the upper end of the range of nebular oxygen abundances derived in the present work ( [ o / h ] between @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) is consistent with the mean stellar magnesium abundance [ mg / h ] = @xmath5 .",
    "however , the mean nebular oxygen abundance is 0.62  dex lower than the oxygen abundance ( [ o / h ] = @xmath6 ) in wlm  15 .",
    "we note that the mean stellar [ mg / h ] in supergiant stars agrees with the nebular [ o / h ] in both ngc  6822 @xcite and sextans  a @xcite .",
    "measurements of additional supergiants in wlm will be crucial in confirming the result in wlm  15 , and whether there are any spatial inhomogeneities in metallicity among stars .",
    "@xcite reported two peaks in the  distribution ; the west maximum lies just north of hm  9 , whereas the second maximum lies approximately 1  east of hm  7 .",
    "figure  [ fig_wlm ] shows that  regions along the eastern edge of the galaxy in the vicinity of the east  peak have nonzero reddening values derived from observed balmer emission - line ratios .",
    "this agrees with the discovery of small regions or patches found to have redder @xmath86 and @xmath87 colors than the rest of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this is thought to be extinction internal to wlm , because the foreground extinction is known to be small ( see table  [ table_wlm ] ) .",
    "we note that the bright  regions ( i.e. , hm  7 and hm  9 ) on the western side of the galaxy do not exhibit any appreciable reddening . a comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig_h2rs ] and [ fig_wlm ] shows that the two supergiant stars measured by @xcite are located next to the eastern  peak .",
    "in fact , the supergiant wlm  15 with the high oxygen abundance is located ( in projection ) near  region hm  18 , where the average reddening was found to be @xmath88 0.5  mag .",
    "we have shown that the present nebular oxygen abundance agrees with previous measurements , and additional explanations are required to explain the discrepancy between the nebular and stellar oxygen abundances .",
    "@xcite reasoned that large changes in stellar parameters would not reconcile the stellar abundance with the nebular abundance .",
    "three alternative scenarios were considered to explain the discrepancy : lowering the nebular abundance through dilution by the infall of metal - poor  gas , the depletion of ism oxygen onto dust grains , and the possibility of large spatial inhomogeneities in the metallicity .",
    "the first two possibilities were shown to be unlikely .",
    "the third possibility may be possible with the discovery of the second  peak .",
    "however , we have shown that there are no significant variations in the nebular oxygen abundance .",
    "nevertheless , two questions arise .",
    "are the nonzero reddenings measured in  regions along the eastern side of the galaxy related to the second  peak seen by @xcite ?    because of their proximity , is there any relationship between the the metallicity of wlm  15 and the highly reddened  regions in the southeast ?",
    "we note that determining the oxygen abundance for the supergiant is not sensitive to internal reddening @xcite .",
    "based on the apparent spatial correlation of the  peak with regions of redder color , nonzero ( internal ) extinctions in  regions to the east and southeast , and the location of the supergiant wlm  15 , these suggest that something unusual may be happening in this more metal - rich part of the galaxy . unfortunately ,  regions hm  18 , 18a , and 18b are underluminous and exhibit very weak nebular emission ; there are few additional bright  regions in the area .",
    "deeper spectroscopy of these  regions may prove illuminating .",
    "however , measurements of additional blue supergiants in the center and the eastern side of the galaxy ( e.g. , wlm  30 ; @xcite ) could show whether the stellar abundances remain high with respect to the nebular values and whether the stellar abundances are also spatially homogeneous .",
    "a new search for molecular gas along the east and southeast sides of the galaxy ( especially in the vicinity of wlm  15 ) would also be timely .",
    "while @xcite did not detect co , their pointings missed regions of interest on the eastern side of the galaxy .",
    "optical spectra of 13  regions were obtained in wlm , and oxygen abundances were derived in nine  regions .",
    "was measured in bright  regions hm  7 and hm  9 .",
    "the resulting direct oxygen abundance for hm  7 is in agreement with previously published values .",
    "our @xmath89 detection of  in hm  9 confirms the lower signal - to - noise measurements reported by @xcite and @xcite . for the remaining  regions , oxygen abundances derived with bright - line methods",
    "are accurate to about 0.2  dex .",
    "we adopt for wlm a mean nebular oxygen abundance 12@xmath0log(o / h ) = @xmath3 , which corresponds to [ o / h ] = @xmath4 , or 15% of the solar value .",
    "the upper end of the range of derived nebular oxygen abundances just agrees with the mean stellar magnesium abundance reported by @xcite , but the present mean nebular result is still 0.62  dex lower than the oxygen abundance derived for the a - type supergiant wlm  15 .",
    "significant reddening values derived from observed balmer emission - line ratios were found in  regions on the eastern side of the galaxy near one of the  peaks discovered by @xcite .",
    "there may be a relationship between the location of the east peak , regions of redder color ( higher extinction ) , large reddenings derived from balmer emission - line ratios in  regions along the eastern side of the galaxy , and the location of wlm  15 .",
