    "the ` many - multiplet ' ( mm ) method is the most precise technique for constraining cosmological changes in the fine - structure constant , @xmath0 , from qso absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "we have previously described self - consistent mm evidence from 143 keck / hires absorbers for a smaller @xmath0 over the redshift range @xmath2 at the fractional level @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "clearly , independent analyses of spectra from different spectrographs are desirable to refute / confirm this .",
    "first attempts with vlt / uves spectra , e.g.  @xcite , generally found null results with quoted uncertainties @xmath4 . to investigate these claims ,",
    "we introduce a simple method for calculating the minimum possible uncertainty on @xmath1 from a given absorption system .",
    "the velocity shift , @xmath5 , of transition @xmath6 due to a small relative variation in @xmath0 , @xmath7 , is determined by the @xmath8-coefficient for that transition , @xmath9\\,\\hspace{1em}\\rightarrow\\hspace{1em}\\frac{v_j}{c } \\approx -2\\frac{\\delta\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\frac{q_j}{\\omega_{0,j}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 & @xmath11 are the rest - frequencies in the lab and at redshift @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the lab value of @xmath0 and @xmath14 is the shifted value measured from an absorber at @xmath12 .",
    "the mm method is the comparison of measured velocity shifts from several transitions ( with different @xmath8-coefficients ) to compute the best - fit @xmath1 .",
    "the linear equation ( [ mureq : da ] ) implies that the error in @xmath1 is determined only by the @xmath8-coefficients ( assumed to have negligible errors ) and the total velocity uncertainty , integrated over the absorption profile , from each transition , @xmath15 : @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this expression is just the solution to a least - squares fit of @xmath19 to data @xmath20 , with errors only on the @xmath21 , where the intercept @xmath22 is also allowed to vary ; this mimics the real situation in fitting absorption lines where the absorption redshift and @xmath1 must be determined simultaneously .    the quantity @xmath15 is commonly used in radial - velocity searches for extra - solar planets , e.g.  @xcite , but is not normally useful in qso absorption - line studies .",
    "most metal - line qso absorption profiles display a complicated velocity structure and one usually focuses on the properties of individual velocity components , each of which is typically modelled by a voigt profile .",
    "however , it is important to realize that @xmath1 and its uncertainty are integrated quantities determined by the entire absorption profile .",
    "thus , @xmath15 should incorporate all the velocity - centroiding information available from a given profile shape . from a spectrum @xmath23 with 1-@xmath24 error array @xmath25 , the minimum possible velocity uncertainty contributed by pixel @xmath26",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath27}\\,.\\ ] ] that is , a more precise velocity measurement is available from those pixels where the flux has a large gradient and/or a small uncertainty .",
    "this quantity can be used as an optimal weight , @xmath28^{-2}$ ] , to derive the total velocity precision available from all pixels in a ( portion of ) spectrum , @xmath29^{-1/2}\\,.\\ ] ] for each transition in an absorber , @xmath15 is calculated from ( [ mureq : sv_i ] ) & ( [ mureq : sv ] ) ; the only requirements are the 1-@xmath24 error spectrum and the multi - component voigt profile fit to the transition s absorption profile .",
    "the latter allows the derivative in ( [ mureq : sv_i ] ) to be calculated without the influence of noise .",
    "once @xmath15 has been calculated for all transitions , the uncertainty in @xmath1 follows from ( [ mureq : lim ] ) .",
    "[ murfig : sim ]    it is important to realize that the uncertainty calculated with the above method represents the absolute minimum possible 1-@xmath24 error on @xmath1 ; the real error  as derived from a simultaneous @xmath30-minimization of all parameters comprising the voigt profile fits to all transitions  will always be larger than @xmath31 from ( [ mureq : lim ] ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that absorption systems usually have several velocity components which have different optical depths in different transitions .",
    "equation ( [ mureq : lim ] ) assumes that the velocity information integrated over all components in one transition can be combined with the same integrated quantity from another transition to yield an uncertainty on @xmath1 .",
    "however , in a real determination of @xmath1 , each velocity component ( or group of components which define a sharp spectral feature ) in one transition is , effectively , compared with only the same component ( or group ) in another transition .",
    "[ murfig : sim ] illustrates this point .",
    "we have calculated @xmath31 for the absorbers from the three independent data - sets which constitute the strongest current constraints on @xmath1 : ( i ) the 143 absorbers in our keck / hires sample @xcite ; ( ii ) the 23 mg / feii systems from uves studied by @xcite ; ( iii ) the uves exposures of the @xmath32 absorber towards he0515@xmath334414 studied by @xcite . for sample ( ii ) , the spectra were kindly provided by b.  aracil who confirmed that they have the same wavelength and flux arrays as those used in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the error arrays : our error array is generally a factor @xmath34 smaller than that used by @xcite ( h.  chand , b.  aracil , 2006 , priv .",
    "we have confirmed this by digitizing the absorption profiles plotted in @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath31 calculated using our spectra will be _ smaller _ than the value @xcite would derive .",
    "the continuum normalization will also be slightly different , but this has negligible effects on the analysis here . for sample ( iii )",
    ", the exposures were reduced using a modified version of the uves pipeline and their @xmath35 matches very well those quoted by @xcite . for samples ( ii ) & ( iii )",
    "we use the voigt profile models published in @xcite & @xcite to calculate @xmath36 . for all samples ,",
    "the atomic data for the transitions ( including @xmath8-coefficients ) were the same as used by the original authors . in practice ,",
    "when applying ( [ mureq : sv_i ] ) and ( [ mureq : sv ] ) we sub - divide the absorption profile of each transition into @xmath37 chunks to mitigate the effects illustrated in fig .",
    "[ murfig : sim ] .",
    "this provides a value of @xmath38 for each chunk @xmath39 .",
    "the final value of @xmath31 is simply @xmath40 ^ 2\\}^{1/2}$ ] ; in all cases this is @xmath41 times the value obtained without sub - divisions .",

    "the main results are clear .",
    "firstly , the 1@xmath24 errors quoted for the hires sample in @xcite always exceed @xmath31 , as expected if the former are robustly estimated .",
    "secondly , for at least 11 of their 23 absorbers , chand et al .",
    "@xcite quote errors which are _ smaller _ than @xmath31 .",
    "recall that since their error arrays are larger than ours , 11 out of 23 is a conservative estimate .",
    "finally , the very small error quoted by @xcite for he0515@xmath334414 , @xmath42 , disagrees significantly with the limiting precision of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the ( supposedly ) strong current uves constraints on @xmath1 fail a basic consistency test which not only challenges the precision claimed by @xcite and @xcite but which must bring into question the robustness and validity of their analysis and final @xmath1 values .",
    "we have introduced a very simple method of determining the limiting precision on @xmath1 obtainable from a set of transitions in a qso absorption system , @xmath31 . only the 1-@xmath24 error spectrum and the model absorption profile ( generally constructed from voigt profiles )",
    "are required to calculate @xmath31 .",
    "the method simply equates the total velocity information contained in the absorption profile of a transition with the expected error on @xmath1 via that transition s sensitivity to @xmath0-variation .",
    "all absorption systems in our hires data - set have quoted uncertainties in @xmath1 which exceed @xmath36 , as expected . however , the uncertainties on @xmath1 currently quoted by @xcite and @xcite from uves spectra are , in many cases , _ smaller _ than @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the uves and hires results can not be reliably compared until more rigorous analyses of the uves spectra are completed ."
