    "in the last several years nuclear effective field theory ( eft ) has been applied extensively to low - energy nucleon - nucleon interactions and to few - nucleon systems @xcite . at energies below 1 gev or so , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "reduces to a hadronic theory containing all interactions allowed by the symmetries of the theory . at the very lowest energies , the interactions are of contact type among nucleons , with arbitrary number of derivatives .",
    "for the two - nucleon system , the nuclear eft has established a concrete systematic foundation for the traditional description represented by the effective range expansion ( ere ) , even with large s - wave scattering lengths generated by bound or nearly bound states @xcite . in systems with more than two nucleons few - body contact forces",
    "are present a three - body force appears already in leading order and the eft provides a well - defined , successful extension of the ere @xcite . at higher energies ,",
    "pions need to be accounted for explicitly in the theory . in this case",
    ", the eft goes beyond the ere even in the two - nucleon system , albeit at the cost of a much more complicated renormalization structure @xcite .",
    "once the leading few - body interactions are determined from few - body systems , the main goal of the eft program is to predict the structure of larger nuclei . before tackling heavy nuclei",
    ", one would like to be able to predict the properties of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "this requires a method of solution whose errors are not larger than eft truncation errors .",
    "a few years ago it was suggested that this could be achieved by putting nucleons on a spatial lattice and using monte carlo methods to compute the partition function @xcite . in this first , exploratory investigation we considered two - nucleon contact interactions only , with parameters adjusted to nuclear matter properties .",
    "subsequently , works have appeared that extend this approach in various directions @xcite .",
    "as yet , however , a full application of eft to nuclear matter has not been carried out . in this work",
    "we take the first step toward this goal by examining the effective range expansion of nucleon - nucleon scattering on a discrete lattice .",
    "the extension of this work to the determination of thermal properties of neutron matter from parameters from few - body physics is currently underway @xcite .    as in any field theory , the parameters that appear in the eft lagrangian or hamiltonian are not directly observable , since the separation between them and the high - momentum components of loops is arbitrary . this separation is the regularization procedure , such as momentum cutoff and dimensional . because the separation is arbitrary",
    ", relations among observables should not depend on the regularization scheme .",
    "the relation between eft parameters and observables , on the other hand , does depend on the regularization , and some regularization schemes are more convenient to apply than others .",
    "the program of predicting many - body properties from few - body physics requires that the relation between parameters and observables be known within the regularization scheme employed in the solution of the many - body problem . placing nucleons in a lattice",
    "is a choice of a regularization scheme .    in this work ,",
    "we examine lattice regularization for the effective field theory on a discrete three - dimensional cubic lattice of a large size . the special aspect associated with the use of a lattice",
    "is that the nucleons are interacting in a closed space , different from scattering of nucleons in the open space . on this issue , the method of lscher @xcite is well known in lattice qcd , and it has been also studied for the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite , especially on the treatment of the scattering lengths larger than the lattice size .",
    "these works examine effects of finite - volume lattice space in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing , that is , in the continuum limit . here , we focus on effects of the _ finite lattice spacing _ in the limit of large lattice volume .",
    "our objective is to determine the parameters of the two - body interaction on the lattice from known phase shifts .",
    "we illustrate the method in the case of sufficiently low energies , when the phase shifts can be represented by the ere parameters .",
    "the method is similar to the continuum case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and follows a preliminary attempt involving one of us ( r.s . ) several years ago @xcite .",
    "an earlier , related work can be found in ref .",
    "our results can be applied to the two - nucleon system at low energies , and the interaction parameters thus determined are to be used for the many - body monte carlo calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite . in principle",
    ", the whole framework could be used at higher energies , densities and temperatures , once pion exchange is included explicitly .",
    "the cutoff or renormalization scale is kept at finite values , and so is the corresponding lattice spacing . as the thermal properties should be examined at the thermal or infinite - volume limit , the lattice results needed are at the limit of large lattice space .",
    "this is usually achieved by performing many - body monte carlo calculations with various lattice sizes , followed by applying the method of finite - size scaling @xcite . upon application of the method",
    ", there is no need to consider explicit dependence on the lattice size in our potential parameters .",
    "determination of the parameters is greatly simplified at the limit of large space size .",
    "in fact , we find that the basic algebra is the same as that in free space , apart from the use of the reaction ( k ) matrix instead of the standard scattering ( t ) matrix .    the paper is organized as follows .",
