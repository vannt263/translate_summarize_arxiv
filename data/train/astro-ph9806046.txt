    "recently , a recalcitrant problem on galaxy formation has been pointed out that low - mass galaxies are overproduced as compared with observations in the context of the hierarchical bottom - up theory of galaxy formation ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ; kauffman , white , & guideroni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "hence , some process that inhibits the formation of low - mass galaxies is required .",
    "photoionization has been considered as one of such mechanisms ( dekel & rees 1987 ; babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1992 ; chiba & nath 1994 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ) . in photoionized media ,",
    "the cooling efficiency is dramatically reduced in the temperature range of @xmath9 .",
    "also , a bulk of energy could be carried into a cloud , so that the enhanced thermal pressure could suppress the gravitational collapse of a subgalactic cloud with the virial temperature lower than several @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 in gas mass ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 , 1985 ; ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; bond , szalay , & silk 1988 ; steinmetz 1995 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ) . in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "an optically thin medium against ionizing photons has been mostly assumed so far ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 , 1985 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ) . in semi - analytic approaches , naive analytic corrections for opacity effects",
    "have been made based on the optical depth criterion ( efstathiou 1992 ) or the strmgren approximation ( chiba & nath 1994 ) . in the case of interstellar clouds",
    ", it is claimed that the strmgren approximation could be misleading against the real effect of the penetration of diffuse uv ( flannery , roberge , & rybicki 1980 ; maloney 1993 ) , and therefore the radiative transfer equation should be solved properly .",
    "however , as far as we know , no study hitherto has been made on determining the ionization structure inside a pregalactic cloud by solving radiative transfer equation for diffuse uv photons .",
    "hence , the effects of photoionization on the evolution of a pregalactic cloud have not been assessed satisfactorily . in this paper",
    ", we solve the radiative transfer of diffuse uv radiation coupled with ionization process to elucidate the self - shielding of pregalactic clouds from uv background radiation and provide a practical criterion for the self - shielding .",
    "we assume for simplicity a spherical top - hat ( uniform ) density distribution of a cloud , and place 100 radial meshes for solving radiation transfer .",
    "also , the cloud is assumed to be composed of pure hydrogen so that we could readily compare the results of the frequency - dependent radiative transfer with an analytic estimate , although we should keep in mind that helium of cosmic abundance could alter the ionization degree maximally by order 10% ( osterbrock 1989 ; nakamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the intensity of uv background radiation at high redshifts is inferred from so - called proximity effect of lyman @xmath12 absorption lines in qso spectra ( bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; giallongo et al .",
    "the observations require the diffuse uv radiation to be at a level of @xmath13 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 ster@xmath15 hz@xmath15 at the hydrogen lyman edge at @xmath16 . in this paper",
    ", we assume the specific intensity of uv background as @xmath17 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 ster@xmath15 hz@xmath15 , where we set @xmath18 and vary @xmath7 in the range of @xmath19 . as for ionization process , we presume the ionization balance , because the ionization or recombination timescale for clouds with density of interest is much shorter than the dynamical timescale .",
    "the equation of the ionization balance is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fraction of neutral hydrogen , @xmath22 is the photoionization rate , @xmath23 is the collisional ionization rate , @xmath24 is the hydrogen number density , and @xmath25 is the total recombination coefficient to all bound levels of hydrogen .",
    "@xmath22 is given by @xmath26 with the photoionization cross section being @xmath27 $ ] , where the local uv intensity @xmath28 at radius @xmath29 is determined by solving transfer equation .",
    "@xmath23 is given by @xmath30 $ ] with @xmath31 .",
    "we assume @xmath32 except where other values are specified .",
    "@xmath25 is well fit by @xmath33 , $ ] where @xmath34 or @xmath35 ( sherman 1979 ) .",
    "photoionization and recombination processes can be respectively regarded as extinction and emission with respect to ionizing photons .",
    "thus , the radiative transfer equation for ionizing photons is described as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the extinction coefficient ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is the emissivity . if a free electron recombines directly to the ground state of hydrogen , the emitted photon has enough energy to cause further photoionization .",
    "but , when an electron is captured to an excited state of hydrogen , the emitted photon does not have enough energy to ionize hydrogen , because the kinetic energy of a free electron is of order 0.1 ryd for @xmath40 k gas .",
    "thus , the former process is regarded as scatterings which provides the emissivity , while the latter process is pure absorption .",
    "the effective scattering albedo is given by @xmath41/\\alpha_a(t)$ ] , which is 0.4 at @xmath1 k ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) , where @xmath42 is the recombination coefficient to all excited levels of hydrogen .",
    "hence , we set @xmath43 , and @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the proton number density .",
    "taking account of frequency - dependence of the emergent uv intensity , it is convenient to divide the photoionization rate into two parts : @xmath47 as for lyman limit photons , the transfer equation is the integro - differential equation which includes a source term by scattering processes of recombination photons .",
    "thus , the equation is numerically solved with including iterative procedure .",
    "we , without invoking on - the - spot approximation which could be misleading for large mean - free - path photons , solve the equation by means of an impact parameter method of high accuracy , which allows us to treat diffuse photons correctly ( stone , mihalas , & norman 1992 )",
    ". we deal with 156 impact parameters for light rays .",
    "also , in order to converge the intensity , we employ the lambda - iteration method ( e.g. mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .    in the range of @xmath48 ,",
    "since photoionization is regarded as pure absorption , the uv intensity is obtained just by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the boundary intensity and @xmath51 is the ionization optical depth .",
    "so , @xmath52 is figured out by @xmath53 considering that the optical depth is @xmath54 with the lyman limit optical depth @xmath55 and that the assumed boundary intensity is @xmath56 , the above equation can be analytically integrated using the incomplete gamma function @xmath57 if @xmath21 is given : @xmath58 with use of this integration , the overall procedure to solve the transfer equation is as follows :    1 .",
    "initially , give the cloud mass @xmath2 and the radius @xmath59 ( therefore the density ) , and set @xmath21 by assuming optically thin medium .",
    "specify the boundary uv intensity by @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   solve the transfer equation at @xmath60 for given @xmath21 , and calculate @xmath61 .",
    "obtain @xmath62 analytically by equation ( [ hardphotoion ] ) .",
    "then , get the total photoionization rate @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   solve ionization equilibrium using above - obtained @xmath22 , and thereby renew @xmath21 .",
    "4 .   continue steps 2 and 3 until @xmath21 converges at a level of relative error of @xmath63 .",
    "( typically 100 iterations are performed . )",
    "note that the analytical integration ( [ hardphotoion ] ) with respect to frequencies enables us to reduce the computational cost dramatically on solving such a frequency - dependent transfer equation including scatterings .",
    "the validity of this method is confirmed by exactly solving the transfer equation with using a number of meshes for frequencies .",
    "we consider the cloud mass range of @xmath64 and vary the radius in the range of @xmath65 .",
    "fig.1 shows the growth of self - shielded regions when a cloud of @xmath66 is contracting , embedded in the uv background of @xmath67 .",
    "the self - shielding is prominent when @xmath68kpc .",
    "it is noted that the distributions of the hi fraction are a gradual function of radii even in the self - shielded stage , where we can not recognize a clear boundary between the neutral core and the ionized envelop , and also a low but noticeable ionization is left in the self - shielded regions .",
    "such distributions seem to be realized by the high frequency photons far above the lyman edge which could permeate into deeper regions due to the smaller cross section for ionization . to ensure this conjecture , we solve the transfer solely for the lyman edge photons to obtain @xmath69 and tentatively set the form of uv radiation spectrum to be @xmath70 at any radius ( which implies that photons of higher frequencies are absorbed with the same ionization cross section as that at the lyman edge ) .",
    "we can see an outstanding difference between two cases as shown in figure 1 . in the tentative case",
    ", we can see a steep inward increase of neutral fraction and a very sharp transition from ionized regions to neutral regions .",
    "figure 2 shows the neutral hydrogen fraction at the center as a function of cloud size .",
    "we see that the central @xmath21 varies abruptly at a certain critical size . here",
    ", we define the critical radius @xmath71 at which the hi fraction at the center drops just below 0.1 . in figure 3 , we plot the critical radii obtained from all the numerical results as a function of uv background intensity .",
    "different symbols represent different mass of gas clouds .",
    "all the results can be remarkably well fitted by a simple formula which is a function of the cloud mass and the uv background intensity ; @xmath72 equivalently , the corresponding critical number density of the cloud is @xmath73 it is worth noting that the critical density is quite weakly dependent upon @xmath2 .",
    "if the cloud is highly ionized and optically thin , the neutral fraction should be @xmath74 with neglecting collisional ionization .",
    "then , we define the critical optical depth @xmath6 at the lyman edge as a measure such that the self - shielding becomes effective : @xmath75 , which turns out to be independent of not only @xmath2 but also @xmath7 .",
    "hence , such a simple criterion of @xmath76 as adopted by efstathiou ( 1992 ) is found heuristically to be practical in order to assess the self - shielding for @xmath40 k clouds .    for clouds of different temperature",
    ", we have found that @xmath77 is scaled by @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "resultingly , @xmath6 is scaled by @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath42 are decreasing functions of temperature , but @xmath81 increases with temperature , so that @xmath6 is larger for higher temperature .",
    "for instance , @xmath82 for @xmath83k . in an extreme case of infinite temperature",
    "( although unrealistic ) , the complete scattering ( @xmath84 ) leads to @xmath85 . in other words ,",
    "clouds with any optical depth can be ionized due to photon diffusion .",
    "here , we try to analytically estimate the critical radius based upon the strmgren approximation .",
    "( a similar estimate is found in chiba & nath 1994 . ) by equating the number per unit time of ionizing photons which enter from the surface to the number per unit time of photons which are absorbed in the cloud , we have @xmath86 @xmath87 ^{1/3},$ ] where the ionized regions are assumed to be sharply separated from the neutral core of radius @xmath88 .",
    "then , the critical radius can be estimated by setting @xmath89 : resultantly we find @xmath90 and the corresponding critical optical depth is @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the dependence of ( [ rcrit ] ) upon the cloud mass and the uv intensity can be fundamentally understood by this argument .",
    "but , from a quantitative point of view , this approximation obviously leads to overestimation of photoionization effects as recognized by the critical optical depth .",
    "the overestimation comes from the assumption that all photons which enter into the cloud always cause ionization .",
    "in fact , some photons which especially have low incident angles do escape from the gas cloud without causing ionization .",
    "the diffusion process of ionizing photons tends to enhance this effect .",
    "furthermore , a sharply edged neutral core , which is the basic assumption in the strmgren approximation , is no longer realistic as shown above .",
    "the present results seem of a great significance on considering the biasing by photoionization against the formation of low - mass galaxies .",
    "it is shown in previous analyses that if a cloud is assumed to be optically thin , the photoionization suppresses the collapse of clouds with @xmath11 ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 ) or circular velocities smaller than @xmath92 ( thoul & weinberg 1996 ) . in the present analysis ,",
    "the permeation of uv radiation is characterized by a different criterion , and the critical density has turned out to be almost independent of the mass . hence , the evolution of subgalactic clouds would not be determined solely by the cloud mass or the circular velocity . the maximum expansion radius of a top - hat density fluctuation is given by @xmath93h_{50}^{-2/3}$ ] in an einstein - de sitter universe , where @xmath94 is the maximum expansion epoch , @xmath95 is the present hubble constant in units of @xmath96 , and the baryon density parameter is assumed to be 0.05 . comparing @xmath97 with ( [ rcrit ] ) and taking into account a possibility that the uv intensity might be significantly lower at @xmath98 , we can speculate that the self - shielding could be quite effective shortly after the maximum expansion stages .",
    "thus , in order to assess the effects of photoionization properly , we should consider the frequency - dependent radiative transfer of diffuse uv photons .",
    "the present results are also relevant to the formation of primordial hydrogen molecules which provide key physics for the formation of the first generation objects ( tegmak et al .",
    "uv radiation will naively suppress the formation of hydrogen molecules and thereby cooling ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "however , when the reionized gas is self - shielded in the course of evolution , h@xmath99 or h@xmath100 ions could form efficiently due to the residual ionization which may lead to the effective production of hydrogen molecules ( e.g. kang & shapiro 1992 ) .",
    "since the formation of primordial hydrogen molecules is a non - equilibrium process , the permeation of even a small portion of uv background photons may play an important role for subsequent molecule formation , and thereby the evolution of neutral core .",
    "we are grateful to t. nakamoto , and h. susa for helpful discussion .",
