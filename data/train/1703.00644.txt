    "our research uses a rf proton accelerator to produce @xmath0 , and it is crucial to define the beam energy as accurately as we can . to do so we need the exact energy value and the energy spread ( standard deviation ) , that from now on will be referred to as `` energy sigma '' .",
    "although we do nt know the two values mentioned above , we do know the gap between any two energies the accelerator produces .",
    "moreover , we can measure the number of neutron yield for a given angle with a long counter detector . to solve our problem",
    ", we search for a well defined energy as a reference .",
    "by extracting this energy we can find another energy that conserves some relation value which we explain later on .",
    "after collecting these differences and their energy sigma we assume they fit each other linearly .",
    "moreover we assume that the energy differences can point out the real value of the reference energy again by linear fit .",
    "this method is a new way to calibrate the proton beam energy . by putting in the equations the measured value of the energy difference extracted from a given experimental data",
    ", we can get the energy sigma and the real value of the reference energy ( `` new reference energy '' ) .",
    "the rest is calibrated in reference to the new reference energy , since as we mentioned before we do know the gap between any two given energies .",
    "we tested this method and confirmed it on experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we found that the angle contributions for this method in a long counter detector are negligible .",
    "first we did simulation with simlit at wide spectrum in terms of energies , angles , and energy sigma . of @xmath0 reaction caused by accelerate protons on lithium target .",
    "the simulation sets we did where to take a constant energy spread and constant maximum angle , meaning we count all neutrons who scattered from the center of the target up to the maximum angle we determine . and we let the simulation to run on a rang of energies far less then the reaction threshold and up to 2 mev .",
    "the simulation based on `` monte carlo '' that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results .",
    "verifying we make at least 10,000 events compensate the statistical error which is square rout of the samples number and to be as accurate as 1% .",
    "the data we extract were the excitation function and they look like figs and .",
    "example of neutron yield vs. energy . as plotted by simlit simulation at two differently angles - 5 and 15 degrees , between the direction of proton beam and the scattered neutron direction and the same energy spread .",
    "point a in the graph is the reference energy as we extract from the derivative ( shown in fig ) and point b is the energy that have 5% of the yield of point a. as can be observed the two graphs are almost similar , suggesting the that the angle dependent is negligible .",

    "we chose the energy that fits this peak as our reference energy .",
    "we define the lower energy as the energy which produces around 5% of the reference energy neutron yield .",
    "this act prevents noise interference . after doing so for several simulations we extract the values of the difference between the two energies in each experiment , and we know the energy sigma and the real value of the reference energy because this was a simulation .",

    "<S> we resolve this problem by finding a reference energy and then finding another energy by examining the data , relative to the reference energy . from the difference between them we can approximate the energy distribution for a given energy , and since we know the energy threshold of the reaction ( @xmath1 for @xmath0 is about @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> we can calibrate the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> we then determine the energy which produce the maximum yield derivative as the reference and record the energy whose neutron yield is 5% of the reference energy . </S>",
    "<S> the data is collected by simulating this reaction using simlit @xcite . since this is a simulation we know the real energy distribution </S>",
    "<S> so we make a linear fit for energy distribution as function of energy difference . </S>",
