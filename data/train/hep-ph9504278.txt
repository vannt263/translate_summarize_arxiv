    "<S> its phase structure has first been analyzed by halperin , lubensky and ma @xcite . for a type - i superconductor , where the scalar self - coupling @xmath0 is small compared to the gauge coupling @xmath2 , the phase transition from the normal `` symmetric '' phase to the superconducting `` higgs '' phase is weakly first - order . </S>",

    "<S> are expected to be important , at least for large values of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> they are related to the infrared behaviour of the non - abelian su(2 ) higgs model in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> so far , the nature of the symmetric phase and the order of the phase transition for large @xmath3 have not been firmly established . in a recent paper @xcite we have studied some non - perturbative aspects of the su(2 ) </S>",
    "<S> higgs model by means of gap equations . </S>",
    "<S> complementing the mass resummation by a vertex resummation a gauge independent set of gap equations was obtained for higgs boson and vector boson masses , defined on the respective mass shells . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis led to the conclusion that the symmetric phase is again a higgs phase , just with different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the first - order phase transition , found for @xmath7 , changes to a crossover at a critical scalar coupling @xmath8 , whose value is correlated with the magnitude of the vector boson mass in the symmetric phase .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we apply the same resummation method to the abelian higgs model in three dimensions . due to the absence of gauge boson self - couplings </S>",
    "<S> the abelian higgs model does not suffer from the same infrared problems as the non - abelian theory . </S>",
    "<S> it may therefore serve as a testing ground for the method employed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much work has been done on the compact and non - compact versions of the abelian higgs model on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations provide evidence for a phase transition from a higgs phase to a symmetric coulomb phase with zero - mass photon for all values of @xmath3 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first recall the results of ordinary perturbation theory . naively , one may expect that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 appear as expansion parameters , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote vector boson and higgs boson mass , respectively . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative expansion would fail in the symmetric phase , for vanishing vector boson mass , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the absence of gauge boson self - couplings the infrared behaviour in the abelian theory is much simpler than in the non - abelian theory . as shown by hebecker @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the effective potential does not develop a term linear in the higgs field to all orders of perturbation theory in the case of non - vanishing higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> the proof immediately implies that the effective potential is finite to all orders also in the symmetric phase , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the perturbative expansion is determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , one also easily verifies that @xmath16 to all orders in the symmetric phase . </S>",
    "<S> hence , perturbation theory in the symmetric phase is free of infrared divergencies for @xmath18 , and its results are consistent with non - perturbative studies on the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use the method developed in @xcite to derive the gap equations for the abelian higgs model . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the three - dimensional theory is given by [ l3d ] s = d^3x , with = 1 ( + i ) , d_= ( _ - i g 2 a _ )  . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a perturbative calculation in the higgs phase , i.e. , we shift the scalar field @xmath19 around its vacuum expectation value @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and add the @xmath22-gauge fixing term l_gf=12(_a_- v ) ^2 and the corresponding ghost term to the lagrangian ( [ l3d ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shifted lagrangian contains the usual cubic and quartic couplings between vector field , higgs field , goldstone field and ghost field .    at tree level the vector boson , goldstone boson , ghost and higgs boson masses are , respectively , [ mtree ] m_0 ^ 2=g^24v^2,m_0 ^ 2=^2+v^2+m_0 ^ 2 , m_c 0 ^ 2=m^2_0,m_0 ^ 2=^2 + 3v^2  . expanding around the asymmetric tree level minimum one has @xmath23 , and thus @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these mass relations aquire corrections in higher orders , and they do not hold for an expansion around the symmetric minimum @xmath25 .    following the approach of @xcite , we now perform a mass resummation . </S>",
    "<S> the tree level masses are expressed as [ masses ] m_0 ^ 2 = m^2 - m^2  ,  m_0 ^ 2 = m^2 - m^2  , m_c 0 ^ 2=m^2-m_c^2  ,  m_0 ^ 2=m^2-m_^2  , where the full masses @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath26 enter the propagators in loop diagrams , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are treated as counter terms perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> note , that the full ghost and goldstone boson masses are chosen such that the tree level mass relations are preserved . </S>",
    "<S> calculation of the vector boson and higgs boson self - energies with full propagators then leads to the coupled set of gap equations [ gaps ] m^2 + _ </S>",
    "<S> t(p^2 = -m^2 , m , m , ) = 0  , + m^2 + ( p^2 = -m^2 , m , m , ) = 0  , where @xmath31 is the transverse part of the vacuum polarization tensor .    </S>",
    "<S> as in the non - abelian case , in order to obtain a gauge independent result for the gap equations ( [ gaps ] ) , it is necessary to also perform the following vertex resummations @xcite , [ vresum ] g^22 v & = & g m - v_^g  ,  = a ,  c ,   ,  , + v & = & g m^24 m - v_^  , =  ,  , + & = & g^2 m^28 m^2 - v_^ , =   ,  . </S>",
    "<S> after these manipulations the lagrangian ( [ l3d ] ) takes the form [ lresum ] l = l_r + l_1 + l_0 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the first term @xmath32 contains the full masses and vertices which enter the loop graphs . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by the sum of the gauge invariant lagrangian @xcite l_rt = 14f_f _ + ( d_)^d _ - 12 m^2 ^ + g^2 m^24 m^2(^)^2  , with the higgs field shifted by the `` classical '' minimum , @xmath33 , and the gauge fixing term l_rgf = 12(_a_- m ) ^2  , supplemented by the corresponding ghost lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lresum ] ) stands for the difference between tree level and resummed quadratic , cubic and quartic vertices , and @xmath35 is the constant term of the shifted lagrangian ( [ l3d ] ) . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are identical to the expressions given in @xcite .    for the one - loop self - energies of vector boson and higgs boson , as evaluated from the lagrangian @xmath36 , we obtain the result ( cf . </S>",

    "<S> t(p^2 ) & = & g^2  , [ higpol ] ( p^2 ) & = & g^24  , with the three - dimensional integrals [ ints ] a_0(m^2 ) & = &  , + b_0(p^2,m_1 ^ 2,m_2 ^ 2 ) & = &  . </S>",
    "<S> the linear divergence of @xmath37 can be cancelled by a counterterm generated by renormalizing the mass parameter @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence is absent in dimensional regularization , which we shall use .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the non - abelian case , the photon self - energy ( [ vacpol ] ) is gauge independent already off the mass shell . </S>",
    "<S> however , the higgs boson self - energy ( [ higpol ] ) has to be evaluated on the mass shell in order to get a gauge independent result . using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gaps ] ) and ( [ vacpol])-([ints ] ) , one obtains the following gap equations for vector boson and higgs boson masses , [ mres ] m^2 & = & m_0 ^ 2 - g zm v ( ^2 + v^2 ) + m g^2 |f(z )  , + m^2 & = & m_0 ^ 2 - 3g2 m v ( ^2 + v^2 ) + m g^2 |f(z )  , [ mres ] with |f(z ) & = & 14  , [ barfw ] +    the equation for @xmath14 becomes complex , since in this case the higgs boson can decay into two vector bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> solutions of the gap equations depend on the vacuum expectation value @xmath20 , which is defined by the requirement that the expectation value of the shifted field vanishes , [ vevdef ]  = 0  . </S>",
    "<S> this condition on the sum of tadpole graphs yields at one - loop order in resummed perturbation theory , [ vev ] v(^2 + v^2 ) & = & - 14 g m ( 4 a_0(m^2 ) + m^2m^2 a_0(m^2 ) + 3 m^2m^2 a_0(m^2 ) ) + & = & 116 g(4 m^2 + m^2 + 3 m^3 m )  . as in ordinary perturbation theory the vacuum expectation value @xmath20 , which is not a physical observable , is gauge dependent </S>",
    "<S> this also implies a weak gauge dependence @xmath39 for the solutions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the gap equations . </S>",
    "<S> since the masses are observables , this gauge dependence must be cancelled by higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the gauge dependence of a particular solution of the gap equations can be used as an indication for the importance of higher order corrections . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall work in landau gauge , @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> for any solution @xmath20 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vev ] ) the gap equations ( [ mres ] ) , ( [ mres ] ) can be written as m^2 & = & g^24 v^2 + m g^2 f(z )  , [ mir ] + m^2 & = & ^2 + 3v^2 + m g^2 f(z ) , [ mir ] with functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 which can easily be obtained from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ barfw ] ) , ( [ barfs ] ) and ( [ vev ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this form of the gap equations is the same in the abelian and the non - abelian higgs model , and it is particularly useful to study the solutions . in the non - abelian case </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath41 is positive , except for very large values of @xmath43 . in particular , for @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution to @xmath41 is due to a gauge invariant subset of graphs corresponding to the gauged non - linear su(2 ) @xmath46-model . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> one finds two solutions of the gap equations for small values of @xmath47 and scalar self - couplings @xmath0 below a critical coupling @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> one solution , with @xmath48 , corresponds to the usual higgs phase . </S>",
    "<S> the second solution , with @xmath49 , can be interpreted as `` symmetric '' phase , which thus appears as another higgs phase with different parameters . to good approximation the vector boson mass in the symmetric phase </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath47 , where two solutions of the gap equations exist , defines the metastability region where a first - order phase transition occurs .    in the case of the abelian higgs model </S>",
    "<S> the situation is very different . here </S>",
    "<S> , the function @xmath41 is negative for all values of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that in the abelian case the non - linear @xmath46-model is a free theory . </S>",
    "<S> hence , no solution with @xmath49 exists , and one is left with a unique solution of the gap equations corresponding to the familiar higgs phase with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this reassures us that the non - trivial values for @xmath20 and @xmath13 found in the symmetric phase of the non - abelian model are not stipulated by our resummation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> it is also consistent with the fact that in the abelian case the values @xmath51 , @xmath15 correspond to a stationary point of the effective potential to all orders of perturbation theory , contrary to the non - abelian case ! </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in the abelian higgs model the trivial vacuum with a massless photon represents indeed the symmetric phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop results of ordinary perturbation theory can be recovered from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mres ] ) , ( [ mres ] ) and ( [ vev ] ) by substituting the tree level masses @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with fixed ratio @xmath54 , into the one - loop expressions . </S>",
    "<S> this yields v(^2 + v^2 ) & = & v^24 ( 14g^3 + 3 ^3/2 + 12 g )  , [ pertvev ] + m^2 & = & -g^24 ^ 2 + g^32 v |f ( )  , + m^2 & = & -2 ^ 2 + g^2v |f ( )  .[pertm ] these equations determine the perturbative results for @xmath20 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the higgs phase .    from the gap equations ( [ vev])-([mir ] ) the vacuum expectation value @xmath55 can be obtained as function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath56 and @xmath47 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the result is plotted as function of @xmath47 , with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it agrees well with the perturbative solution obtained from ( [ pertvev ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is the value @xmath51 , corresponding to the symmetric phase . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath58 the system is in the higgs phase with a large vacuum expectation value . </S>",
    "<S> this solution of the gap equations persists up to a small positive value of @xmath47 , where it terminates . </S>",
    "<S> the range of small positive @xmath47 with a higgs solution  la coleman - weinberg @xcite corresponds to the metastability region of the theory . compared to perturbation theory , the gap equations predict a smaller range in @xmath47 with metastability . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 vector boson and higgs boson masses are shown for the same parameters as in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> in the symmetric phase , for positive @xmath38 , the perturbative masses are @xmath16 and @xmath59 .    ordinary perturbation theory and </S>",
    "<S> also the gap equations are only reliable for type - i superconductors , where @xmath3 and @xmath60 are small . as eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vev ] ) and ( [ pertvev ] ) show , the results become strongly gauge dependent otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the one - loop results are no longer trustworthy . for type - ii superconductors other methods </S>",
    "<S> have to be used . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting is the use of coarse grained effective actions @xcite where high frequency modes are integrated out .    for type - i superconductors , with small @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the gap equations confirm the conventional picture of a first - order phase transition between a perturbative higgs phase and a symmetric coulomb phase , which is familiar from ordinary perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also in agreement with non - perturbative numerical simulations on a lattice . on the contrary , in the non - abelian su(2 ) </S>",
    "<S> higgs model a non - vanishing vector boson mass in the symmetric phase is expected on general grounds , and it is also found by explicit non - perturbative solutions of the gap equations . the difference between abelian and non - abelian higgs models with respect to the symmetric phase is also reflected in the nature of the transition . in the abelian higgs model one expects a phase transition for all values of @xmath0 , with a possible change from first - order to second - order at some critical coupling @xmath8 . for the non - abelian higgs model , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the gap equations predict a change from a first - order transition to a smooth crossover already at a rather small value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further studies of the symmetric phase of the non - abelian higgs model are crucial in order to achieve a full understanding of the electroweak phase transition .    </S>",
