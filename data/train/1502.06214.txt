    "<S> there is significant scope to further enhance the degree of hyperpolarization in nd . in particular , by adding a microwave capability to our brute force hyperpolarizer at mk temperature ( based on a dilution refrigerator ) , much larger polarization appear possible . </S>",
    "<S> eliminating isolated defects via surface passivation techniques @xcite will also likely result in longer relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> another direction is to work with isotopically enriched @xmath0c nds to increase the number of spins that contribute to the signal and enhance spin diffusion from polarization sites on the surface to the spins in the core . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we mention the possibility of using nds for long time storage of nuclear polarization that is transferred to the hydrogen nuclei in an aqueous environment using cross - polarization sequences @xcite . this modality would enable life - science applications in which nanodiamond is tracked and imaged using standard mri technology . </S>"
