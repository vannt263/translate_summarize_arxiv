    "the epoch of reionization of the universe started with the emission of the first ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium ( hereafter , igm ) , and ended when all the low - density regions of the universe were ionized . during this period of time , the ionizing photons reaching the igm had to be sufficient to ionize every atom in the universe and to balance any recombinations in the igm ( in addition , many more ionizing photons may have been emitted in regions of dense , self - shielded gas , which were locally absorbed and did not contribute to ionizing the igm ) . at the end of reionization , the mean free path of ionizing photons increased to scales much larger than the typical separation of the collapsed halos hosting the sources .",
    "regions of dense , self - shielded gas ( observed as lyman limit systems ) shrank in size as the ionizing background increased in intensity , due to the growing mean free path ( miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees 2000 ) .",
    "if the fraction of baryons in regions of intermediate density which were ionized as the mean free path increased was small , the rise in the background intensity could be relatively fast , as seen in the numerical simulations of gnedin ( 2000 ) .",
    "precisely this rapid change of the ionizing background intensity has been inferred by fan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to occur at @xmath11 , by analyzing the change of the mean transmitted flux of the ly@xmath9  forest in the highest redshift quasars known .",
    "the transmitted flux apparently drops abruptly to very low levels near @xmath12 .",
    "this observation most likely implies that the end of reionization occurred , in fact , at @xmath11 , although as a larger number of quasars at @xmath13 are discovered , more detailed investigations of this issue will need to be done to understand precisely how the mean free path grew . in particular , the number of small gaps of transmitted flux , such as the one seen in a @xmath14 quasar by white et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , provides information on the size of the regions before they overlapped ( miralda - escud 1998 ; barkana 2002 ) .",
    "the results of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ; bennett et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) have strengthened the observational support of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario in a flat model that contains a vacuum energy component ( in addition to the ordinary baryonic matter and dark matter ) .",
    "the model parameters are being measured with increasing accuracy via combined observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy clustering , weak lensing , and the ly@xmath9  forest .",
    "the theory then makes an increasingly reliable prediction for the abundance of collapsed dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "it is in these halos that the process of radiative gas dissipation and star formation can take place , leading to the emission of ionizing radiation .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the efficiency of star formation , the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the emission due to gas accretion into black holes ( be they in x - ray binaries or active galactic nuclei ) , and the fraction of the ionizing photons that escape into the igm from the dense regions in which they are emitted , prevent a clear prediction for the history of reionization .",
    "even if the time at which reionization _ ends _ is determined to be at @xmath11 by the gunn - peterson trough ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) observations , there can be a long time interval in which the universe was partially ionized , with cosmological regions around the sources filling only some fraction of the volume . a very good observational probe for the characteristic time at which the bulk of the baryons in the universe were ionized is the electron scattering optical depth to the cmb , @xmath15 .",
    "this has been measured for the first time by _ wmap _ ( kogut et al",
    ".  2003 ; spergel et al .  2003 ) using the large - scale polarization - temperature anisotropy correlation .",
    "at present , the result still has a large error , both observational and model - dependent : kogut et al .",
    "find a model - independent value of @xmath16 from the polarization - temperature correlation of the _ wmap _ data , but spergel et al .",
    "find @xmath17 from a fit of a cdm model with a running spectral index to a combined data set of cmb , galaxy clustering and ly@xmath9  forest observations , and @xmath18 when the fit is forced to the usual cdm model with a primordial power - law spectrum .",
    "a value of @xmath19 would imply that most baryons were reionized as early as @xmath20 .",
    "the announcement of the measurement of @xmath15 by _ wmap _ has led to a large number of papers discussing the possibility of this early reionization in the cdm model ( whyithe & loeb 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; holder et al .",
    "2003 ; ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 ; somerville & livio 2003 ; sokasian et al .  2003 ; cen 2003 ; chiu , fan , & ostriker 2003 ) .",
    "these authors have generally found that , if one is willing to assume a high efficiency in the production of ionizing photons per unit mass in the low - mass halos collapsing at early times , then early reionization and a high optical depth is possible in cdm models . naturally , the lower the power spectrum amplitude on small scales , the higher the efficiency that is required , and some models can be ruled out based on their small power on small scales , such as the warm dark matter model ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . but",
    "to a large extent , the ability of the cdm model to accommodate a wide range for the epoch at which the bulk of the igm was reionized simply reflects our ignorance of the efficiency in producing ionizing photons that escape .",
    "however , a reasonable question we can ask is how the required efficiency compares to any observationally determined values of the rate at which ionizing photons have been emitted over the history of the universe , taking into account the predicted abundances of halos of different masses that form at each redshift . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a very simple model of the ionizing emissivity from cdm halos , but which still captures the essential physical ingredient for the process of reionization : as the medium is ionized , the gas is heated and the jeans mass is raised , implying that some low - mass halos where gas can collapse when the medium is neutral are unable to continue to accrete gas after the medium is ionized .",
    "we divide halos into two populations , the `` high - mass '' ones ( which will be called population a ) that are able to accrete gas and form new stars irrespective of the state of the intergalactic medium , and the `` low - mass '' ones ( population b ) that can form stars and emit ionizing radiation only when the medium is neutral . low - mass halos collapse",
    "first in cdm , but as they ionize the medium around them the rate of star formation can be suppressed , until the high - mass halos start to collapse ( couchman & rees 1986 ; shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ) .",
    "a similar separation of halo classes was made by haiman & holder ( 2003 ) ; our population a corresponds to their type ii and type ia halos ( haiman & holder separated these halos into the ones that can or can not cool by atomic cooling after they have accreted the gas ; we will not distinguish between these two classes in our more simple model ) , and our population b corresponds to their type ib population .    our calibration of the efficiency to produce ionizing photons is based on observations of the ly@xmath9  forest during the post - reionization era . the mean transmitted flux of the ly@xmath9  forest , combined with cdm simulations of ly@xmath9  forest spectra and measurements of the baryon density of the universe , allows us to infer the intensity of the ionizing background ; and the abundance of lyman limit systems tells us the mean free path of ionizing photons .",
    "the ratio of the background intensity to the mean free path then yields the volume - averaged emissivity .",
    "this emissivity was inferred to be , at most , seven ionizing photons per baryon and per hubble time at @xmath0 by miralda - escud ( 2003 ) .",
    "remaining uncertainties on the value of this emissivity are related mainly to the temperature of the igm and the cdm power spectrum amplitude . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the abundance of lyman limit systems becomes highly uncertain , so the emissivity can not be inferred .",
    "the key question for reionization is , of course , how this emissivity changes with increasing redshift .",
    "if the comoving emissivity stays constant at @xmath21 , the optical depth @xmath15 is not larger than @xmath22 ( miralda - escud 2003 ) . in cdm models ,",
    "the fraction of mass in halos that can form stars decreases with redshift at @xmath21 , so to obtain @xmath23 ( which requires an increase of the emissivity with redshift ) , the low - mass halos ( or population b ) formed at @xmath24 must have a much higher efficiency to emit ionizing radiation than the halos of higher mass at @xmath25 .",
    "the question we are addressing in this paper is : how much higher does this efficiency have to be in order to produce a certain value of the optical depth @xmath15 , and what constraints are imposed by requiring reionization to end at @xmath12 ?",
    "we describe our model for the efficiency to emit ionizing radiation in  2 .",
    "results are presented in  3 , and a general discussion is given in  4 .",
    "we use three cdm models to predict the halo abundances .",
    "all the models assume flat space with a cosmological constant , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the three models vary in the normalization and slope of the power spectrum : model 1 has @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; model 2 has @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; and model 3 has @xmath31 , @xmath33 ( here , @xmath34 is the linear rms mass fluctuation at present on spheres of radius @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the primordial scalar spectral index ) .",
    "the power spectrum is computed with the fitting formula of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "model 1 has the smallest amplitude of fluctuations on the small scales on which the first halos that emit ionizing radiation collapse ( @xmath37 to 1 mpc ) , and model 3 has the largest amplitude .",
    "model 3 , with the largest power on small scales , has halos forming at the highest redshift , and therefore predicts an earlier start of reionization and higher optical depth @xmath15 than the other models for a fixed ionizing emissivity per unit mass .",
    "model 1 has the same parameters as the best fit model found by _",

    "model 2 also has a slightly larger power than the best fit cdm model without a running spectral index found by spergel et al .",
    "( which has parameters @xmath40 and @xmath32 ) . finally , model 3 is very close to the best fit of spergel et al .",

    "; cen 2003 ) .",
    "measurement of the ly@xmath9  forest has allowed a determination of the power spectrum amplitude on the smallest scales .",
    "we therefore compare the amplitude of our models with the determination of the ly@xmath9  forest power spectrum by croft et al .",

    "the high amplitude of model 3 would seem to be ruled out by the result of croft et al . ;",
    "note , however , that the quoted error on this measurement does not include some potentially important systematic effects , as discussed in croft et al .",

    "halos are divided into two populations : those which do not emit any ionizing photons after the medium around them has been reionized ( population b ) , and those which are massive enough to continue forming stars and producing ionizing photons after reionization ( population a ) . in this paper",
    "we place the division between the two populations at a velocity dispersion @xmath47 , based on the suppression of gas infall and cooling in smaller halos caused by photoionization ( efstathiou 1992 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . the lower limit to the velocity dispersion of the population b of low - mass halos is placed at @xmath48 , because molecular hydrogen cooling below a temperature of @xmath49 k is ineffective ( yoshida et al .",

    "the emissivity as a function of redshift is shown in figure 4 for the same models .",
    "at redshift just above @xmath100 , the emissivity declines with redshift because the abundance of population a halos ( which are the only ones contributing when the medium is entirely ionized ) drops rapidly .",
    "the emissivity increases again at redshifts higher than the end of reionization , when population b halos contribute .",
    "models with higher @xmath61 can obviously have a higher emissivity at very high redshift , but their emissivity declines at intermediate redshifts when @xmath69 is close to unity and the emission from population b halos is suppressed , as assumed in equation ( [ emisb ] ) .",
    "the models with higher @xmath61 result in higher optical depths because the igm is reionized earlier .",
    "for a fixed cdm halo population , the most simple model for the emissivity is to say that the rate of photon emission per unit mass is constant for all halos in which cooling can take place , i.e. , with @xmath101 .",
    "this model , using the emissivity per unit mass calibrated with the observational determination at @xmath0 and a clumping factor of one , predicts a redshift at which reionization ends of @xmath102 to @xmath103 , in very good agreement with the observation of the appearance of the gunn - peterson trough at @xmath12 .",
    "the emissivity history in this model shows a decline with redshift from @xmath0 to @xmath104 , then a slight increase up to @xmath105 as more population b halos contribute , and then a rapid decline beyond @xmath106 10 to 15 as the number of all halos decreases .",
    "obviously , the reionization history should also depend on the clumping factor affecting the recombination rate .",
    "we have assumed a clumping factor of unity , and a higher clumping factor would delay the end of reionization .",
    "a moderate clumping factor of 2 or 3 would not greatly affect the result , because the recombination time at the mean baryonic density is equal to the hubble time at @xmath12 and the increase in @xmath93 is relatively fast for the @xmath96 models ( solid lines in fig .",
    "3 ; this is simply due to the rapid increase in the mass fraction in collapsed halos shown in fig.1 ) , so the number of recombinations is not very large .",
    "for example , a clumping factor of 3 for model 1 with @xmath57 ( panel b ) delays the end of reionization from @xmath12 to @xmath107 . as discussed by miralda - escud",
    "( 2000 ) , and miralda - escud ( 2003 ) , the clumping factor is unlikely to be large during reionization .",
    "therefore , we have the remarkable result that the simplest model of a constant emissivity per unit mass in cdm halos , calibrated with the observed emissivity at @xmath0 , roughly predicts the right epoch for the end of reionization .",

    "the emissivity of population a halos at @xmath0 is about 60 photons per baryon per hubble time , as obtained by dividing the mean emissivity @xmath55 of 7 photons per baryon per hubble time ( see  2.3 ) by the fraction of baryons in population a halos at @xmath0 ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "since in these models with high optical depth the universe is reionized at @xmath124 over a time interval corresponding to @xmath125 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , or one quarter of a hubble time , the total emission during this time interval coming from the first halos needs to be about @xmath126 and @xmath127 photons per baryon in population b halos , for models 1 and 3 .    to compare this to the number of photons that can be produced by star formation",
    ", we use the models of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see their fig .",

    "most of the ionizing photons are produced by stars with @xmath129 , and in the case of a salpeter imf with stars forming only in the range @xmath130 , 25000 photons per baryon can be emitted .",
    "note that this number is equal to the ratio of the energy obtained by hydrogen fusion ( 7 mev ) to the average energy of an ionizing photon ( 20 ev ) times the fraction of stellar mass that is fused to helium ( @xmath131 % ) times the fraction of energy emitted as ionizing photons ( @xmath132% ) .",
    "very massive stars with zero metallicity can further increase this emission to @xmath133 photons per baryon ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ) , because their convective cores during the main - sequence include almost all the mass of the star ( zero metallicity stars also have higher temperature than metal - rich ones during the main - sequence , which increases the fraction of energy they emit in ionizing radiation , but also increases the average energy of their ionizing photons ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath134 is the fraction of the gas in a halo that can be converted to stars with @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape to the igm , then an optical depth @xmath19 requires @xmath137 for models ( 1,3 ) for zero - metallicity stars , and @xmath138 for models ( 1,3 ) for metal - enriched stars .",

    "however , if a high optical depth is confirmed by future measurements , an explanation for the dramatic change in ionizing emission from the low - mass halos that formed the first stars to the more massive halos at lower redshift will need to be found .",
    "a difficulty in making star formation very efficient in low - mass halos is that their shallow potential wells makes them more vulnerable to lose their gas as a result of stellar winds , photoionization and supernovae .",
    "the escape fraction might be higher than in more massive halos at lower redshift , but only after gas has been ionized and expelled from the vicinity of stars , in which case the gas can easily escape from the halo .",
    "the typical halo where stars form at @xmath124 with velocity dispersion @xmath143 and total mass of @xmath144 ( e.g. , yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ) has a gas mass of @xmath145 within a virialized radius @xmath146 parsecs , and cooling by molecular hydrogen leads to the formation of a dense central gas clump containing only @xmath147 1% of the gas mass .",
    "the rest of the gas must take more than a halo dynamical time ( @xmath148 years ) to reach the center and cool before it has any possibility to form stars , by which time supernovae would have taken place .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations of these first star - forming halos ( abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) suggest that the first stars may all be very massive .",
    "if the @xmath149 of the core of cooled gas can efficiently form one or a few massive stars , and most of the emitted ionizing photons escape , one may barely be able to achieve the fraction @xmath150 required for @xmath19 .",
    "after the formation of these stars , the supernovae explosions would expel the remaining gas from the halo ( bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 ) .    in halos of higher mass ( with @xmath62 of 10 to 30 @xmath151 ) , a larger number of supernovae would be required to expel the gas .",
    "nevertheless , the effects of photoionization and supernova explosions should still self - regulate the rate of massive star formation , and it is not clear why the earliest galaxies at high redshift could have higher values of @xmath152 than the more massive galaxies formed at lower redshift . while the mean gas density in galaxies should increase with redshift , increasing gas cooling rates , the shallower potential wells of low - mass halos allow for gas dispersal after a smaller fraction @xmath134 of gas has turned to massive stars .",
    "another possibility is that black holes formed by the first massive stars are able to accrete gas .",
    "gravitational accretion can produce radiation with an efficiency @xmath153 times greater than stellar fusion ( and stars generally fuse only a fraction of their mass ) . in this case , requiring a fraction as low as @xmath154 of the halo gas to accrete on a central black hole could produce the @xmath120 photons per baryon in halos required for @xmath19 , depending on the fraction of the accretion energy emitted as ionizing photons ( we have assumed 20% here ) .",
    "however , whether one speculates about a high efficiency of massive star formation or of gas accretion into black holes , the question that remains unanswered is why such high efficiency to produce ionizing radiation would occur only in the first halos at high redshift , and not in similar or more massive halos at later times .",
    "if it were nevertheless possible to produce these high emissivities when the first stars formed , a second possible problem of an early reionization might be that the high emissivity leads to a rapid end of reionization , in contradiction with the presence of the gunn - peterson trough at @xmath12 .",
    "our results suggest a way to solve this particular problem : as seen in figure 3 , once the fraction of the igm that is ionized becomes close to unity , the emissivity can be decreased because star formation in population b halos is suppressed .",
    "this can regulate the rate of emission to a level that just balances recombinations , and it is only when the more massive population a halos reach a critical abundance that the emissivity can rise again , completing reionization and causing the fast increase in the mean free path of ionizing photons that clears the gunn - peterson trough .",
    "thus , in all our models the end of reionization occurs between redshift 5 and 8 , even though the models with high @xmath61 can ionize half of all the volume as early as @xmath121 . in the models with the earliest reionization in figure 3 , the redshift for the end of reionization",
    "could easily be lowered to fit the observed value of 6 by moderately increasing the clumping factor after @xmath69 is close to unity or increasing the value of @xmath155 that separates our populations a and b.    note that models with high @xmath61 have an emissivity history that is double peaked : there is a first maximum due to population b halos , then the emissivity declines as most of the igm is ionized , and a second maximum is then caused by population a halos . the possibility of a double - peaked history of star formation due to the effect of reionization raising the jeans mass was proposed by couchman & rees ( 1986 ) and shapiro et al .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply a `` double reionization '' , as other authors have argued ( cen 2003 ; whyithe & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "the fraction of ionized volume @xmath93 rises monotonically with time , and it is only `` stalled '' by the suppression of the star formation due to ionization , in a self - regulated process . a double reionization in which the universe recombines again",
    "after having been ionized would require a long delay of the feedback ionization effects on the star formation rate .",
    "if this delay were present , the suppression of star formation might start to operate only after stars have already emitted more than enough photons to ionize all the universe ; later , when the igm recombines again , star formation might not resume at the same level for some time , allowing for partial recombination to occur .",
    "this feedback delay might be caused by a reservoir of gas in population b halos that can keep forming stars after the surrounding low - density medium is ionized , and by the finite time required for new recombined and cooled gas to accrete in the population b halos after the igm recombines again ; but it is not clear if this would be sufficient to cause the global instability in the star formation rate that would be required for a double reionization .    finally , comparing our results with other recent work , we note that other authors ( e.g. , whyithe & loeb 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2003 ; somerville & livio 2003 ; sokasian et al .  2003",
    "; cen 2003 ) have generally emphasized that the central value of the _ wmap _ result @xmath156 can be obtained in cdm models with a physically allowed emissivity of ionizing photons .",
    "although we agree with this conclusion , we note that a drastic change in the emissivity per unit mass of star - forming halos from @xmath116 to @xmath0 is required . for example , ciardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find , using our model 3 , that @xmath157 can be reached in models where the dominant emission comes from halos corresponding roughly to our population a , but the emissivity they assume would vastly overpredict the intensity of the ionizing background at @xmath0 . at the same time , models with no such change in the emissivity yield a lower optical depth that is still within the plausible error range of the _ wmap _ result .",
    "our approach is closest to that of chiu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who use an ionizing emission efficiency chosen to yield reasonable models for the ionizing background , and our conclusions are generally in agreement with theirs .",
    "the first detection of the thompson optical depth to the cmb by the _ wmap _",
    "mission introduces a new era in the study of reionization .",
    "the observations of the gunn - peterson absorption in the highest redshift quasars , which are sensitive to the time when reionization ended and the mean free path of ionizing photons increased , can be confronted with the total ionized column to the surface of last scattering , which is sensitive to the epoch when about half of the baryons in the universe were ionized .",
    "the simplest assumption we can make about the emissivity is that it is roughly constant in all halos in which gas can cool .",
    "when we calibrate the emissivity to the upper limit allowed by observations at @xmath0 , we find that the end of reionization is close to @xmath12 , as suggested by observations , but that the optical depth is smaller than @xmath22 . to obtain an optical depth as high as @xmath19 ( the central value of the _ wmap _ result ) ,",
    "an increase of the rate of ionizing emission per unit mass in collapsed halos with redshift , of a factor @xmath118 to @xmath158 ( depending on the cdm power spectrum model ) from @xmath0 to @xmath20 , is required .",
    "further progress on our understanding of the reionization epoch will come , among other things , from an increased accuracy in the measurement of @xmath15 , as well as more robust measurements of the power spectrum on small scales from ly@xmath9  forest observations .",
    "the discovery of quasars at @xmath13 and the search for any small fraction of ly@xmath9  transmitted flux in gaps along their gunn - peterson trough ( white et al .  2003 ) may also allow us to test if the fraction of the ionized medium was close to unity for a wide redshift range above @xmath12 ( as in our models with high @xmath61 in fig .",
    "3 ) , or if it increased rapidly over a short redshift range .",
    "if an optical depth as high as the central value of the _ wmap _ measurement is confirmed , then either a physical explanation for the high efficiency of the ionizing emissivity of the first objects will need to be found , or some more fundamental modification of the cdm model , such as non - gaussian fluctuations on small scales ( e.g. , avelino & liddle 2003 ) , may be implied .",
