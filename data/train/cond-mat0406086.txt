    "curved space - times are familiar from einstein s theory of gravitation,@xcite where the metric tensor @xmath0 , describing distances in a curved space - time with local lorentz invariance , is determined by the solution of the einstein equations .",
    "a major problem for an experimental investigation of the ( kinematical as well as dynamical ) properties of curved space - times is that generating a significant curvature , equivalent to a ( relatively ) small curvature radius , is a close to impossible undertaking in manmade laboratories .",
    "for example , the effect of the gravitation of the whole earth is to cause a deviation from flat space - time on this planet s surface of only the order of @xmath1 ( the ratio of schwarzschild and earth radii ) .",
    "the fact that proper gravitational effects are intrinsically small is basically due to the smallness of newton s gravitational constant @xmath2m@xmath3kg@xmath4sec@xmath5 .",
    "various fundamental classical and quantum effects in strong gravitational fields , a few of which we discuss below , are thus inaccessible for earth - based experiments .",
    "the realm of strong gravitational fields ( or , equivalently , rapidly accelerating a reference frame to simulate gravity according to the equivalence principle ) , is therefore difficult to reach .",
    "however , earth - based experiments are desirable , because they have the obvious advantage that they can be prepared and , in particular , repeated under possibly different conditions at will .    the formalism to be described in what follows",
    "is aimed at the realization of _ effective _ curved space - time geometries in perfect fluids , which can indeed be prepared on earth , and which mimic the effects of gravity inasmuch the kinematical properties of curved space - times are concerned . among such perfect fluids",
    "are bose - einstein condensates , i.e. , the dilute matter - wave - coherent gases formed if cooled to ultralow temperatures , where the critical temperatures are of order @xmath6k ; for a short review of the ( relatively ) recent status of this rapidly developing field see ref.@xcite . in what follows , it will be of some importance that bose - einstein condensates belong to a special class of quantum perfect fluids , so - called superfluids.@xcite    the curved space - times we have in mind are experienced by sound waves propagating on the background of a spatially and temporally inhomogeneous perfect fluid . of primary importance",
    "is , first of all , to realize that the identification of sound waves propagating on an inhomogeneous background , which is itself determined by a solution of euler and continuity equations , and photons propagating in a curved space - time , which is determined by a solution of the einstein equations , is of a _ kinematical _ nature .",
    "that is , the space - time metric is fixed externally by a background field obeying the laws of hydrodynamics ( which is prepared by the experimentalist ) , and not self - consistently by a solution of the einstein equations @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and the speed of light are set to unity ) .",
    "the latter equations relate space - time curvature  represented by the einstein tensor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the ricci tensor and @xmath11 the ricci scalar  with the energy - momentum content of all other fundamental quantum fields .",
    "this energy - momentum content is represented by the classical quantity @xmath12 , which is the regularized expectation value of a quantum energy - momentum tensor.@xcite    as a first introductory step to understand the nature of the proposed analogy , consider the wave equation for the velocity potential of the sound field @xmath13 , which in a homogeneous medium at rest reads @xmath14\\phi = 0 , \\label{waveeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the sound speed .",
    "it is a constant in space and time for such a medium .",
    "this equation has lorentz invariance , that is , if we replace the speed of light by the speed of sound , it retains the form shown above in the new space - time co - ordinates obtained after lorentz - transforming to a frame moving at a constant speed less than the sound speed . just as the light field _ in vacuo _ is a proper relativistic field , sound is a `` relativistic '' field .",
    "the lorentz invariance can be made more manifest by writing equation ( [ waveeq ] ) in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17diag(@xmath18 is the ( contravariant ) flat space - time metric ( we choose throughout the signature of the metric as specified here ) , determining the fundamental light - cone structure of minkowski space;@xcite we employ the summation over equal greek indices @xmath19 assuming , then , the sound speed @xmath20 to be local in space and time , and employing the curved space - time version of the 3 + 1d laplacian @xmath21,@xcite one can write down the sound wave equation in an _ inhomogeneous medium _ in the generally covariant form@xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 $ ] is the determinant of the ( covariant ) metric tensor .",
    "it is to be emphasized at this point that because the space and time derivatives @xmath24 are covariantly transforming objects in ( [ curvedspacewaveeq ] ) , the primary object in the condensed - matter identification of space - time metrics via the wave equation ( [ curvedspacewaveeq ] ) is the contravariant metric tensor @xmath25.@xcite in the condensed - matter understanding of analogue gravity , the quantities @xmath25 are _ material - dependent _ coefficients .",
    "they occur in a dispersion relation of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the covariant wave vector , with @xmath28 the ordinary spatial momentum ( or quasi - momentum in a crystal ) .",
    "the contravariant tensor components @xmath25 , for a perfect , irrotational liquid turn out to be@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unit matrix and @xmath31 a space and time dependent function , to be determined from the proper equations of motion for the sound field ( see below ) . inverting this expression according to @xmath32 , to obtain the covariant metric @xmath0 , the fundamental tensor of distance reads @xmath33 where the line element is @xmath34 .",
    "this form of the metric has been derived by unruh for an irrotational perfect fluid described by euler and continuity equations;@xcite its properties were later on explored in more detail in particular by visser.@xcite i also mention that an earlier derivation of unruh s form of the metric exists , from a somewhat different perspective ; it was performed by trautman.@xcite    the conformal factor @xmath31 in ( [ gdown ] ) depends on the spatial dimension of the fluid .",
    "it may be unambiguously determined by considering the action of the velocity potential fluctuations above an inhomogeneous background , identifying this action with the action of a minimally coupled scalar field in @xmath35-dimensional space - time:@xcite @xmath36 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\frac12 \\int d^{d+1}x % dt dz   \\sqrt{-{\\sf g } } { \\sf g}^{\\mu\\nu }   \\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial_\\nu \\phi \\ , , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that the compressibility @xmath37 of the ( barotropic ) fluid , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the pressure and @xmath40 the density of the fluid , is a constant . using the above canonical identification",
    ", it may easily be shown that the conformal factor is given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is mentioned here that the case of one spatial dimension ( @xmath42 ) is special , in that the so - called conformal invariance in two space - time dimensions implies that the classical equations of motion are invariant ( take the same form ) for any space and time dependent choice of the conformal factor @xmath31 .",
    "the line element @xmath43 gives us the distances travelled by the phonons in an effective space - time world in which the scalar field @xmath13 `` lives '' .",
    "in particular , quasiclassical ( large momentum ) phonons will follow _",
    "light_-like , that is , here , _",
    "sound_-like geodesics in that space - time , according to @xmath44 .",
    "particularly noteworthy is the simple fact that the constant time slices obtained by setting @xmath45 in the line element are conformally flat , i.e. the quasiparticle world looks on constant time slices like the ordinary ( newtonian ) lab space , with a simple euclidean metric in the case of cartesian spatial co - ordinates we display .",
    "all the intrinsic curvature of the effective space - time is therefore encoded in the metric tensor elements @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "together with matt visser , i described this curvature and its properties for an isotachic fluid ( i.e. , having a speed of sound independent of space and time).@xcite using that phonons move on geodesics , we discovered in@xcite the phenomenon that a vortex acts on quasiclassical phonons as an effective gravitational lens .",
    "in ref.@xcite , using the fact that there is curvature in any spatially inhomogeneous flow ( that is , a flow which is not a simple superposition of translational motion and rigid body rotation ) , we have shown that there exists a sonic analogue of the `` warp - drive '' in general relativity permitting superluminal , i.e. , here `` superphononic '' motion.@xcite the point made by us is that in the acoustic curved space - times we consider , there is no violation of any condition on the positivity of energy necessary , which is in marked contrast to the original warp drives , where local energy densities by necessity must be negative to permit superluminal travel.@xcite this is due to the fact that the einstein equations , relating curvature and energy - momentum content of all fields other than gravitational fields , as already mentioned in the above do not need to be imposed in the analogy .",
    "it is important to recognize that the form ( [ curvedspacewaveeq ] ) of the wave equation is valid generally ( with a possible additional scalar potential term ) .",
    "that is , a generally covariant curved space - time wave equation can be formulated not just for the velocity perturbation ( sound ) potential in an irrotational euler fluid , for which we have introduced the effective metric concept . if the spectrum of excitation ( in the local rest frame ) is linear , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the propagation speed of _ some _ collective excitation , the statement that an effective space - time metric exists is true , provided we only consider wave perturbations of a single scalar field which constitutes the fixed classical background .",
    "the argument to reach this conclusion is as follows .    given that the action density @xmath50 is a functional of @xmath51 and its space - time derivatives @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 $ ] , we expand the action to quadratic order in the fluctuations around some stationary classical background solution @xmath54 of the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "for any lagrangian of the specified form , the wave equation for perturbations @xmath55 above the background @xmath54",
    "is@xcite @xmath56 the above equation in covariant notation reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a background - field dependent effective potential ( equal to the second term in round brackets in equation ( [ general ] ) divided by @xmath59 ) .",
    "the potential @xmath60 may , for example , in the simplest case contain an effective mass of the scalar field , such that the wave equation becomes klein - gordon like , @xmath61 .",
    "the effective metric coefficients are , up to an ( again dimension dependent ) conformal factor given by : @xmath62 the concept of an effective space - time metric therefore applies to every system having a single scalar wave equation of second order in both space and time derivatives , corresponding to perturbations propagating on a fixed classical background , where this background itself determines the metric coefficients .",
    "we assumed in eq.([action ] ) that the compressibility @xmath37 is a constant .",
    "this entails that the ( barotropic ) equation of state reads @xmath63 .",
    "we then have , in terms of the interaction between the particles ( atoms ) constituting the fluid , a contact interaction ( pseudo-)potential , @xmath64 .",
    "this is indeed the case for the _ dilute _ atomic gases forming a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "well below the transition temperature , they are described to good accuracy by the gross - pitaevski mean field equation for the order parameter @xmath65 , breaks particle number conservation ( the global u(1 ) invariance ) ; for a review of the consequences see ref.@xcite . ] representing the expectation value of the quantum field operator @xmath66:@xmath67 \\psi ( { \\bm x},t ) .",

    "the latter equation implies that the flow is irrotational save on singular lines , around which the _ wave function phase _",
    "@xmath51 is defined only modulo @xmath72 . therefore , circulation is quantized,@xcite and these singular lines are the center lines of quantized vortices",
    ". the isothermal chemical potential @xmath73 ( which we have chosen to incorporate the kinetic energy term @xmath74 ) , is augmented by the `` quantum pressure term '' @xmath75 , which is the one genuine quantum term in ( [ jaeq ] ) , because @xmath76 ( observe that the first order in @xmath77 may be incorporated into the velocity potential ) . the second equation ( [ conteq ] )",
    "is the continuity equation for conservation of particle number , i.e. , atom number in the superfluid gas .",
    "the dynamics of the weakly interacting , dilute ensemble of atoms is thus that of a perfect euler fluid with quantized circulation of singular vortex lines , which are the only vortical excitations in a superfluid .",
    "the fact that it is an euler fluid is true save for regions in which the density rapidly varies and the quantum pressure term @xmath78 becomes relevant , which happens on scales of order the coherence length @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a constant asymptotic density far away from the density - depleted ( or possibly density - enhanced ) region .",
    "the quantum pressure becomes relevant in the depleted - density cores of quantized vortices , or at the low - density boundaries of the system , and is negligible outside these domains of rapidly varying or low density .",
    "the whole armoury of space - time metric description of excitations , explained in the last section , which is based on the euler and continuity equations , is then valid for phonon - like excitations of a bose - einstein condensate , with the space - time metric ( [ gdown ] ) , as long as we are outside the core of quantized vortices , ) arising therefrom , may be found in ref.@xcite . ] and far enough from the boundaries of the condensate .",
    "quasiparticles are the fundamental entities used to describe an interacting condensed matter system in a particle picture , that is , in a suitable fock space . on the microscopic level ,",
    "if the elementary constituents interact by two - body forces , we are given a second quantized hamiltonian operator of the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the matrix elements for two - particle interaction in a plane wave basis , and @xmath83 are the bare single particle energies of the `` elementary '' bosons or fermions , which are created by the operators @xmath84 from the proper particle vacuum .",
    "one then employs a unitary , i.e. operator - algebra - conserving bogoliubov transformation@xcite to another set of quasiparticle operators @xmath85 , @xmath86 , see eq.([bogotrafo1 ] ) below .",
    "this gives the hamiltonian the reduced diagonal form @xmath87 , where @xmath88 represents additional terms of higher order than quadratic , which are supposed to be small compared to the leading diagonalized part of the hamiltonian , for the picture of noninteracting quasiparticles to make sense .",
    "these quasiparticles possess a ( possibly spatially anisotropic ) dispersion relation @xmath89 which is linear for various important classes of quasiparticles , @xmath90 . among these classes of collective excitations",
    "are , e.g. , phonons , antiferromagnetic magnons,@xcite or the excitations around the gap nodes of the @xmath39-wave superfluid @xmath91he - a.@xcite    phonons are the small momentum quanta of the sound field in solids or fluids , with @xmath92 for a medium at rest .",
    "their classical equation of motion in a perfect fluid is the generally covariant wave equation ( [ curvedspacewaveeq ] ) , with the effective space - time metric ( [ gdown ] ) . in the simplest case , for a homogeneous medium with space and time independent density , and a constant speed of sound @xmath15 ,",

    "that is , the quantum excitation field in a homogeneous medium may generally be decomposed into plane waves , with the appropriate frequencies as a function of momentum stemming from the dispersion relation , here @xmath95 .",
    "note , in particular , that for this spatially and temporally homogeneous case , the statement that we observe positive frequency ( energy ) with respect to the laboratory time interval @xmath96 is unique , that is , it can be made independent of time and space . in an inhomogeneous fluid , this is ( generally ) no longer the case , and the notion of an excitation having positive energy may depend on where the detector is located in the fluid , if it is at rest relative to the fluid or moves , and what its natural time interval is",
    ". the latter may be different from that of the laboratory , due to the particular way the detector couples to the fluid , see section [ gibbonshawking ] .",
    "the number of particles assigned to the quantum field @xmath97 is unique with respect to a certain given state @xmath98 of the quantum field , @xmath99 , provided we decompose @xmath97 into modes associated to the operators @xmath100 and their hermitian conjugates .",
    "the number of particles is , in particular , zero for the _ vacuum state with respect to the field operator @xmath101 _ , defined by @xmath102 .",
    "however , it need not be zero with respect to another set of quasiparticle operators @xmath85 , which has a _ different _ vacuum @xmath103 .    to demonstrate the basis dependence of quasiparticle number",
    ", we use a general bogoliubov transformation for bosons , the class of ( quasi-)particles we consider , of the general form @xmath104 where @xmath105 represents a set of quantum numbers , not necessarily the plane waves used in eq.([homo ] ) .",
    "the coefficients in the bogoliubov transformation must fulfill certain conditions for the transformation to be unitary , i.e. , to preserve the bosonic commutation relations for the new operators , @xmath106=   \\delta_{{\\bm i}{\\bm k}},\\ , [ \\hat b_{\\bm i } , \\hat b_{\\bm k}]=0,\\ , [ \\hat b^\\dagger_{\\bm i } , \\hat b^\\dagger_{\\bm k}]=0 $ ] . as a consequence of this defining unitary character , the following conditions on the transformation coefficients must hold : @xmath107 by using the transformation ( [ bogotrafo1 ] ) , it is straightforwardly shown that the number of @xmath101 particles in @xmath103 is given by @xmath108 : the old operator @xmath100 does not annihilate the new vacuum @xmath109 ( and vice versa ) , and what looks empty in one quasiparticle vacuum may be full of quasiparticles in another .",
    "related to this ( formal ) operator - basis dependence is the fact that the actually _ detected _ number of particles is strongly _ observer _ dependent , as opposed to the formally defined quantity @xmath110 , which refers to one particular quasiparticle state @xmath111 .",
    "the detected number of particles depends , in particular , on how the detector actually couples to the field @xmath97 whose quanta it measures .",
    "various couplings of the detector , for example to different powers of the fluid density , will influence the quasiparticle basis in which the detector measures , and thus the quasiparticle number detected .",
    "now , the salient point is that because the phonon field @xmath97 is a _ relativistic _ quantum field , we will be able to map the observer dependence just described , which is general and holds for any sort of quasiparticles , to the observer dependence experienced by proper relativistic quantum fields in curved or flat space - time.@xcite the observer dependence is of kinematical origin , i.e. , it originates in the fact that the relativistic quantum field propagates in a space - time of lorentzian signature , cf .",

    ", we will make use of expanding bose - einstein condensates , which are produced by reducing the trapping potential strength , i.e. the harmonic trapping frequency with time , or by increasing the interaction coupling constant .",
    "firstly , it is thus appropriate to describe the evolution of density and velocity distribution in the expanding gas by discussing the so - called scaling procedure established in refs.@xcite .",
    "the scaling procedure introduces a set of generally three scaling variables , @xmath112 , which are a function of time only . using these scaling variables ,",
    "one writes for the ( cartesian ) co - ordinate vector components @xmath113 ; for the scaled co - ordinate vector we use the shorthand notation @xmath114 .",
    "it may then be shown that the evolution of the bose - einstein - condensed gas cloud is described , starting from the initial density and velocity potential distributions @xmath115 , @xmath116 , by the following density and velocity distributions ( from here on we take @xmath117):@xcite @xmath118 this is true provided the scaling parameters @xmath119 fulfill the equations@xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the initial trapping frequencies and the dimensionless `` scaling volume '' reads @xmath122 .",

    "observer - related phenomena are at the heart of quantum field theory on nontrivial , and generally curved , space - time backgrounds .",
    "they tell us , in particular , that the particle content of a given quantum field depends on the ( motional ) state of the detection apparatus , which is verifying that there are particles by its `` clicks '' .",
    "more technically speaking , the dependence of the particle content of quantum fields in curved space - time is rooted in the non - uniqueness of canonical field quantization in riemannian spaces.@xcite it is of fundamental importance to make these observer - dependent effects measurable , because such a measurement constitutes , _ inter alia _ , a consistency check for an all - important concept of standard quantum field theory , namely that the quantization of a given field is carried out on a _ fixed _ space - time background .",
    "that the experimental verification of the observer dependence is exceedingly difficult with light becomes readily apparent if we calculate the unruh - davies temperature : the result is that it equals @xmath183   a = 4\\ , { \\rm k } \\times a[10^{20 } g_{\\oplus } ] \\,,$ ] where @xmath184 is the acceleration of the detector in minkowski space ( @xmath185 is the gravity acceleration on the surface of the earth ) , and @xmath186 the speed of light .",
    "the huge accelerations needed to obtain measurable values of @xmath187 make it obvious that an observation of the effect with light ( photons ) is decidedly a less than trivial undertaking . although proposals for a measurement with ultraintense short pulses of electromagnetic radiation have been put forward in , e.g. , refs.@xcite , it is less than obvious how the thermal spectra associated to the effect , which still furnish tiny contributions to the total energy , should be discernible from the background dominated by the ultraintense lasers used to create large accelerations of the elementary particles contained in the plasma .",
    "we first discuss the simplest case of an isotropically expanding gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "we will see that this case also serves a pedagogical purpose , because it forces us to distinguish between purely observer - related phenomena with thermal spectrum , which by definition all have @xmath188 , and `` cosmological '' particle creation with a thermal spectrum , as defined in section [ cosmological ] , for which the scaling functions @xmath189 in ( [ deff ] ) depend explicitly on scaling time .",

    "eq.([blineelementiso ] ) with @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "however , using the isotropic harmonic expansion setup , one has to face the difficulty that in order to give the frw metric ( [ blineelementiso ] ) near the center of the trap ( i.e. , close to @xmath199 ) the de sitter form , one has to increase exponentially the interaction with laboratory time : because of ( [ defh ] ) , @xmath200 = \\exp[c_0 \\lambda t]$ ] .",
    "though the central density also decreases exponentially ( like @xmath201 ) , the exponential increase of the coupling `` constant '' incurs strong three - body recombination losses,@xcite whose total rate ( in the dilute gas case and in three spatial dimensions ) is proportional to @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "therefore , within a short time of order @xmath203 , the bose - einstein - condensed gas of interacting single atoms will simply no longer be in existence , because the atoms rapidly form bound states .",
    "such an experiment will leave no time to measure phenomena which depend on the fact that an equilibrium is established ; in particular , the thermal equilibrium for the occupation numbers in the de sitter quasiparticle basis will not be established on such a short time scale .    even more importantly , though one obtains indeed a thermal spectrum in the de sitter quasiparticle basis corresponding to the metric ( [ desittercomoving ] ) , @xmath204 $ ] depends on time , i.e. , it is not a constant in the quasiparticle basis corresponding to the mode functions @xmath205 $ ] .",
    "the thermal spectrum obtained therefore is , by our physical definition , the thermal `` cosmological '' quasiparticle creation discussed in the previous section .",

    "the analysis of the excitation modes in a strongly anisotropic , elongated bose - einstein condensate is based on the adiabatic separation ansatz@xcite @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the radial wavefunction characterized by the quantum number @xmath142 ( only zero angular momentum modes are considered here ) .",

    "it is important to recognize that an effective exponential `` acceleration '' of the oscillation frequencies , either because of the exponential dependence of laboratory time on scaling time , represented by ( [ trafo ] ) , or coming from the wkb approximation for the scattering amplitudes , and the exponentially small mixing of positive and negative frequency parts resulting therefrom , eq.([alphat0beta ] ) , is sufficient for the thermal spectrum to be obtained . in particular , though we have discussed a space - time which possesses a horizon , no pre - existing horizons in the parent space - time are necessary _ per se _ for thermal occupation number distributions to be established , as has been pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "an explicit example is the unruh - davies effect , where this parent , global space - time is simply minkowski space .      to detect the gibbons - hawking effect in de sitter space - time , one has to set up a detector which measures frequencies in units of the inverse de sitter time @xmath241 , rather than in units of the inverse laboratory time @xmath123 ; this corresponds to measuring in the proper de sitter quasiparticle vacuum , where , in particular , positive and negative frequency are defined with respect to @xmath241 .",

    "namely , the laser with frequency @xmath264 , causing transitions between the two hyperfine levels @xmath248 and @xmath249 , couples to the _ square root _ of the central mean - field particle density . this particular coupling ( represented by the second term in the first line of the above lagrangian ) is what we need , because @xmath268 .",

    "the equilibration time scale of the detector , and thus the time scale on which the rabi oscillations between the detector states are damped out , is set by the detector frequency standard ( the level spacing ) @xmath277 , and by the renormalization factor @xmath220:@xcite @xmath291 the renormalization factor @xmath220 contained in ( [ cond1 ] ) determines the equilibration rapidity because it physically expresses the strength of detector - field coupling .",
    "it is related to the initial diluteness parameter @xmath292 of the bose - einstein condensate and to the ratio @xmath293 , which determines inasmuch the system is effectively one - dimensional , @xmath294 . to obtain sufficiently fast equilibration",

    "_ quite dense , it is to be stressed that the central density decays like @xmath304 during expansion .",
    "therefore , the rate of three - body recombination losses quickly decreases during the expansion of the gas , and the initially relatively dense bose - einstein condensate , which would rapidly decay if left with a @xmath305 close to unity , can live sufficiently long , the total rate of three - body losses decreasing like @xmath306 .",
    "the primary statement to be drawn from the present article is that phonons , i.e. , low - energy linear - dispersion quasiparticles , moving in a spatially and temporally inhomogeneous bose - einstein - condensed superfluid gas , are equivalent to photons , the quanta of the electromagnetic field , moving on geodesics in a given curved space - time .",
    "we have explored the classical as well as the quantum aspects of this statement .    on the classical side",
    ", the analogy helps to provide us with a simple general means to study quasiparticle propagation in an inhomogeneous medium in motion .",
    "an example of such an application is the gravitational lensing effect exerted by a superfluid vortex.@xcite on the quantum field theoretical side , we can access within the analogy phenomena which are extremely difficult if not impossible to access with light .",
    "one of the fundamentals of quantum field theory , the fact that the particle content of a quantum field depends on the observer , can thus be experimentally verified for the first time .",
    "the basic reason that the phenomena in question are ( comparatively ) easy to simulate in a condensed matter system is that the energy and temperature scales , under which they occur , relative to the typical energy scales of the system , can be changed at will by the experimentalist in a very controlled manner .",
    "more particularly , the temperature of the thermal spectrum of phonons to be measured in the gibbons - hawking effect can be made relatively large compared to the axial phonon frequencies and the actual temperature of the gas itself , by expanding the condensate cloud rapidly enough . in the condensed matter analogue ,",
    "the typical energy of the quanta produced can in principle be even made to approach the relevant `` planck '' scale , i.e. , the point in the quasiparticle energy spectrum where it begins to deviate from being linear .",
    "finally , on a more adventurous side , one could conceive of carrying out experiments in `` experimental '' cosmology , as opposed to the currently existing purely `` observational '' cosmology .",
    "in such an experimental approach to matters cosmological , one would try to reproduce under certain specified and , in particular , well - defined initial conditions large - scale features of the cosmos , in the laboratory setting of nonstationary , inhomogeneous superfluid gases .",
