    "quantum theory is arguably the most complete and successful description of the inherent evolution of physical systems . at the same time",
    ", any information we can access about physical systems is ultimately classical .",
    "the interface between the quantum and classical domains is constituted by quantum ensembles and quantum measurements , the former capable of preparing quantum states upon input of some classical information , the latter of extracting some classical information from quantum systems .    from the fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "it is thus crucial to characterize ensembles and measurements in terms of the maximal amount of extractable information , leading to results such as entropic uncertainty relations  @xcite and device - independent quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "this characterization has deep consequences in a plethora of applications , such as information locking  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite , tomography  @xcite , communication  @xcite , witnessing  @xcite , private decoupling  @xcite , purification of noisy measurements  @xcite , and error correction  @xcite , where the efficiency  or the success itself  of the protocol depends on the generated input - output statistics .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of quantifying the maximal amount of information that can be extracted from a quantum ensemble , or by a quantum measurement .",
    "the former problem , known as the _ accessible information problem _ , was introduced  @xcite almost half a century ago , while the latter , known as the _ informational power problem _ , is much younger  @xcite .",

    "relevant examples of @xmath0-designs are so - called symmetric , informationally complete ( sic ) measurements  @xcite , and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases ( mubs )  @xcite .",
    "they play a crucial role in our understanding of the state space  @xcite , in quantum bayesianism  @xcite , and are key ingredients in many of the abovementioned quantum information processing protocols .",
    "we derive lower bounds on the entropy of the input distribution of @xmath0-design ensembles and of the output distribution of @xmath0-design measurements . from these results ,",
    "we derive upper bounds on the accessible information and the informational power of @xmath0-design ensembles and measurements , as a function of the dimension of the system only . as a consequence ,",
    "we show that , perhaps surprisingly , the statistics generated by @xmath0-designs , although optimal for the abovementioned protocols , never contains more than one bit of information . as particular cases , we provide the accessible information and informational power of sic and mub ensembles and povms ( analytically for dimensions two and three , numerically otherwise ) . finally , we extend our results to generalizations of sics and mubs with arbitrary rank .",

    "we conclude by presenting a few relevant open problems . analytically characterizing the accessible information and the informational power of sic ensembles and povms in dimension larger than @xmath102 seems a hard task , as suggested by the irregular behavior of the corresponding line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] .",
    "however , preliminary results seem to suggest that the same task for @xmath70-mub ensembles and povms could be feasible . indeed , consider the unique  @xcite ( up to unitary transformations and permutation of elements ) @xmath129-dimensional @xmath70-mub ensemble @xmath36 and povm @xmath37 , whose coefficients with respect to some fixed orthonormal basis are given ( up to a normalization ) by the columns of the following matrices @xmath202 the orthonormal povm @xmath133 and ensemble @xmath134 given by @xmath203 are such that @xmath204 , and we conjecture that this value is optimal , namely @xmath205 .",
    "another relevant open problem is whether there exists a maximally informative @xmath0-design , namely a @xmath0-design saturating the upper bound in theorems  [ thm : accinfobound ] and  [ thm : infopowerbound ] for any dimension @xmath66 .",
    "we showed that the answer is on the affirmative for @xmath148 , where sic ensembles and povms are optimal , and for @xmath150 , where both sic and @xmath70-mub ensembles and povms are optimal .",
    "however , numerical results presented in fig .  [ fig : bounds ] seem to suggest that , for @xmath206 , nor sics nor @xmath70-mubs are maximally informative @xmath0-designs .",
    "finally , a very interesting open question is how to generalize arbitrary quantum @xmath0-designs to the arbitrary - rank case , in the same spirit of the generalizations for sics and mubs previously discussed  @xcite , and how to quantify their accessible information and informational power .",
    "we believe that these tantalizing open problems well deserve future investigation .",
