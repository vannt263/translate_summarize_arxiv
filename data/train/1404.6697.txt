    "the search for spinons has been a quest in experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics for decades , primarily because the fractionalization of excitations is a characteristic of exotic collective quantum many - body states , such as the spin liquids @xcite .",
    "moreover , in some cases the mechanism of confinement of spinons is a condensed - matter analog of the confinement of quarks in quantum chromodynamics . in this paper , building on a previous brief presentation @xcite , we will explore systems where confinement and deconfinement of spinons can be detected and characterized using large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations in the valence - bond ( vb ) basis .",
    "we here focus on a range of different 1d systems but note that the same ideas have also already been applied to 2d systems in the context of deconfined quantum - criticality @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our studies is the @xmath0 afm heisenberg chain , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where the nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the total number of spins , and we apply periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the ground state of the plain heisenberg model ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) can in principle be solved exactly by the bethe - ansatz approach @xcite , but in practice many of its salient features , such as the power - law decaying spin - spin correlations , were found using the bosonization method @xcite . reflecting the deconfined spinons , the lowest excited states of the heisenberg model form bands of degenerate singlets and triplets @xcite with the energy @xmath10 as a function of the total momentum @xmath11 of the state being @xmath12 , which was first calculated by des cloiseaux and pearson using the bethe ansatz.@xcite forming all possible combinations of two spinons propagating independently with fixed momenta , @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 gives a continuum above the lower bound and an upper bound given by @xmath16 .",
    "a large spectral weight between these bounds ( concentrated close to the lower bound because of matrix elements  @xcite ) , which is detectable in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite , is considered a good indicator of spinons in one dimension .",
    "the continuum spectrum of spinons has been observed in weakly coupled - chain compounds such as copper pyrazine dinitrate and kcuf@xmath17 at zero magnetic field @xcite , while in none - zero magnetic fields incommensurate modes have been observed @xcite . in another chain compound ,",

    "the above experimental results can be modeled using the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenberg ] ) including the other effects mentioned above ( external fields , inter - chain couplings ) .",
    "in addition to neutron scattering , other experimental signals of spinons have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "so far , however , all the experimental probes give indirect information on the existence of spinons , and not much information on the properties of spinons other than their dispersion and excitation continuum .",

    "we here explore a wider range of 1d systems where confinement and deconfinement can be studied systematically under various conditions .",
    "the method operates in a basis of vbs ( two - spin singlets ) and unpaired spins and allows us to compute quantities defining the size of an isolated spinon as well as the size of an @xmath23 bound state .",
    "we also show that the same length scales appear in standard spin correlation functions , but are harder to access there in practice because the signal only appears in the differences between correlations in different spin sectors ( and is therefore very noisy in qmc calculations of large systems ) .",

    "for the trial state , we normally choose an amplitude - product state @xcite , where the coefficients @xmath44 in ( [ psitfa ] ) are simple products of amplitudes @xmath62 corresponding to bond - lengths @xmath63 ; @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of bonds of length @xmath63 in vb configuration @xmath66 .",
    "these amplitudes can in principle be determined variationally @xcite to optimize the trial state , but in practice such optimization is not crucial and the simulations converge well regardless of the details of the trial states .",

    "the momentum is also a good quantum number and is determined by the trial state . with the simple amplitude - product trial states we are using , the momentum can be obtained very easily by translating the bonds by one lattice spacing .",
    "if the number of bonds is odd , i.e. , the number of sites is of the form @xmath69 for some integer @xmath70 , this results in a negative phase , and , thus , the momentum @xmath71 .",

    "these are exactly the momenta of the ground states of bipartite spin chains .",
    "in addition to the use of the vb basis for singlet ground states , extensions of the vb basis with unpaired spins also provide a natural and convenient way to describe excitations with higher spin @xcite . in our study of spinons",
    ", we will study systems with one or two unpaired spins . in the former case ,",
    "the total number of sites @xmath9 is odd , and a generalized vb state can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : shalf }    where the notation explicitly indicates the location @xmath63 in the chain of the unpaired spin and @xmath66 labels the possible @xmath76-bond configurations with this site excluded . for system with even @xmath9 and two unpaired spins , analogously an extended vb basis state is written as @xmath77 singlet pairs and two unpaired spins on different sublattices .",

    "if we fix the spin-@xmath80 orientation of the unpaired spins , as we do here , the strings do not contribute to the weight ( since they only have one allowed state , in contrast to the two allowed states of each loop ) and the overlap of two states is still given by eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) .",
    "note , in particular , that the unpaired spins can be at different lattice locations and the states still always have non - zero overlap .",
    "the strings do contribute to expectation values .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in periodic chains of odd size @xmath9 , which we use here to study a single unpaired spin in @xmath0 states , there is magnetic frustration caused by the boundary condition and the lattice is no longer strictly bipartite .",
    "thus , maintaining the updating rules in the simulations @xcite the vb singlets here can some times be formed between sites on the same sublattices if we continue to label the sites as alternating a and b , except for one instance of adjacent aa or bb sites .",

    "in many cases ( which we will discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] ) the system is completely dominated by short bonds and the distance between the bra and ket spinon is then always even in practice .",

    "if we strictly label the sites with sublattice labels @xmath40 and @xmath41 , there is a defect in the odd-@xmath9 system , as discussed above .",
    "however , in the simulations there are no explicit references to sublattices and in effect the system is then translationally invariant .",
    "then , under the further assumption that no bonds with length as large as @xmath83 are present ( such configurations having ill - defined signs ) @xcite , the momentum is @xmath73 or @xmath82 , for @xmath9 of the forms @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .      in order to study spinon sizes and confinement lengths , we consider overlaps written in the form @xmath86 generalizing eq .",

    "we have an analogous form @xmath87 for @xmath23 ( spinon - pair ) systems .",
    "the overlaps are not computed explicitly in the simulations but serve as normalization factors and weights in the sampling procedures , such that the different contributions to the above sums appear according to their relative weights .",
    "the practical simulation procedures for @xmath74 are relatively straight - forward generalizations of the method with loop updates for @xmath68 .",
    "we refer to refs .   for technical details . in the following , we discuss distribution functions used to characterize spinons .",
    "we will here make us of the unpaired spins , although in principle one can also define spinon quantities using the entire strings , of which the unpaired spins are the end points .      as discussed above , in the vbpqmc method",
    "the bra and ket states are generated stochastically , and for @xmath0 we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : overlapshalf ] ) to define a distribution of the separation of the unpaired spins in the bra and ket states .",
    "restricting ourselves to a translationally invariant system we have the probability of separation @xmath88 ( up to an irrelevant normalization factor which is easily computed at the end ) : @xmath89 where the subscript @xmath90 serves to indicate that the unpaired spins should be on the same sublattice ( because there is an excess of one site on one of the sublattices , which is the sublattice with the unpaired spin ) , which we can take as the @xmath40 sublattice .",
    "thus , @xmath91 should vanish when the separation @xmath63 is an odd number of lattice spacings .",
    "our basic assertion is that , if spinons are well - defined quasiparticles of the system , then we expect @xmath92 to reflect the size and shape of an _ intrinsic _ `` wave packet '' within which the net magnetization @xmath93 carried by the spinon is concentrated .",
    "we will show in the following that 1d vbs states are characterized by an exponentially decaying overlap , @xmath94 , and it is then natural to take @xmath1 as a definition of the intrinsic spinon size .",
    "we should here note again that , for a periodic system with an odd number of sites , there is , strictly speaking , no absolute distinction between the sublattices ( i.e. , the system is strictly speaking not bipartite ) .",

    "the spinon size is always similar to the size of the bound state .    in the bethe - ansatz solution of the heisenberg chain , spinons are non - interacting particles ( kinks and anti - kinks ) , but it should be noted that these particles are obtained from the original spin degrees of freedom using a highly non - local transformation .",
    "what we have probed here is instead more direct measures of the spatial `` concentration '' , @xmath91 , of the total magnetization of a single spinon , and the correlations between ( essentially ) the center of mass of two such distributions , @xmath151 . since our calculation projects out the lowest state with given total spin , in the case of @xmath23 the total momentum @xmath71 ( in the case of a chain with @xmath72 sites )",
    "therefore , the spinons here are not propagating , having individual spin @xmath232 and @xmath82 ( these giving the lowest possible energies in light of the des clauseaux - pearson dispersion ) . in principle",
    "our calculations can also handle total momentum away from @xmath71 , but in practice , due to phase problems in the monte carlo sampling , we are restricted to momenta close to @xmath232 and @xmath82 .",
    "in the future , it would be interesting to more exhaustively characterize all the length scales of the system ( including @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as well as the spin and vbs correlation lengths ) and their divergences under the various conditions afforded by the models we have performed initial studies on here .",

    "<S> using several different one - dimensional models , we characterize @xmath0 spinon excitations using the intrinsic spinon size @xmath1 and confinement length @xmath2 ( the size of a bound state ) . the spinons have finite size in valence - bond - solid states , infinite size in the critical region ( with overlaps characterized by power laws ) , and become ill defined ( completely unlocalizable ) in the nel state ( which we stabilize in one dimension by introducing long - range interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify that pairs of spinons are deconfined in uniform spin chains but become confined upon introducing a pattern of alternating coupling strengths ( dimerization ) or coupling two chains ( forming a ladder ) . in the dimerized system , </S>",
    "<S> an individual spinon can be small when the confinement length is large ; this is the case when the imposed dimerization is weak but the ground state of the corresponding uniform chain is a spontaneously formed valence - bond - solid ( where the spinons are deconfined ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on our numerical results , we argue that a system with @xmath3 is associated with weak repulsive short - range spinon - spinon interactions . in principle , both the length scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 can still be individually tuned from small to infinite ( with @xmath4 ) by varying model parameters . in contrast , in the ladder system the two lengths are always similar , and this is the case also in the weakly dimerized systems when the corresponding uniform chain is in the critical phase . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> the effective spinon - spinon interactions are purely attractive and there is only a single large length scale close to criticality , which is reflected in the standard spin correlations as well as in the spinon characteristics . </S>"
