    "the corot space mission @xcite was operating for almost 6 years , producing thousands of continuous photometric light curves .",
    "the readout of each ccd exposure transfers simultaneously the flux of 6,000 stars .",
    "the temporal series of exposures are processed by the production pipeline , correcting the data for known instrumental effects , such as gain , background , jitter , emi , saa discarding , time corrections @xcite .",
    "but even after these model - based corrections , some collective trends are still visible in the light curves ( fig .",
    "[ guterman : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the flux gradually decreases with unknown shape and a different slope for each star .",
    "previous work to correct these effects has been suggested , including magzep @xcite , that uses a zero - point magnitude correction , associated with the sysrem systematics algorithm @xcite .",
    "+ algorithms for removing systematics consist of two parts : 1 ) identify the _ effects _ among a set of stars by combining all light curves like sysrem @xcite , see also @xcite , finding combination of a few representative stars @xcite or fitting a model for each exposure based on observational @xcite or instrumental quantities @xcite , then 2 ) remove them by properly adapting them to each light curve .",
    "an effect is a pattern that appears among a large set of independent stars .",
    "effects can be additive , multiplicative or follow any law that needs to be determined . in the common techniques ,",
    "the effects are derived from a training set of stars using correlation methods like the iterative sysrem @xcite .",
    "the training set can be a properly selected subset of stars or even the whole set itself .",
    "+ after their global determination , the effects need to be scaled and subtracted from each of the light curves .",
    "classical fitting techniques like least square are not satisfactory because the resulting coefficient is partly pulled by the light curve s natural shape and disturbs the scientific signal .",
    "for example , the gradual loss of sensitivity visible in fig .  [ guterman : fig1 ] correlates with any long - period stellar variability , resulting in removing some real signal . to avoid this critical drawback",
    "we propose here a technique similar to magzep @xcite that fits the instrumental effects to each exposure independently .",
    "the effect of each exposure is a function of only two instrumental stellar parameters , position on the ccd and photometric aperture .",
    "the advantage is that the effect is not a function of the stellar flux , and therefore much more robust .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows : section [ sectmethod ] describes the systematics removal method and its application to corot , section [ sectresult ] reviews the derived effects and the performances of the method and section [ sectsummary ] summarizes and concludes this work .",
    "we compute the _ residual _ per pixel of each star by removing its zero point @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the star s flux and @xmath3 is the mask surface in pixels .",
    "the fluxes are divided by the photometric aperture size @xmath3 because systematics are at the pixel scale .",
    "the average flux @xmath4 is integrated over the first 4 days of the run , before any drift could occur .",
    "thus , all residuals are distributed around zero at the beginning of the run .",
    "[ guterman : fig2 ] ( left ) , which depicts the histogram of the stellar flux during the 4 last days of the run , shows that by the end of the run , the residuals are significantly below zero .",
    "the fluxes loose about 30@xmath5 on average after 140 days .",
    "this offset does not seem proportional to the flux itself , but rather linked to the position of the star on the ccd ( right ) .",
    "moreover , the dependence is close to linear , hence suggesting a model @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the systematic offset of the @xmath8 exposure of the @xmath9 star located at position @xmath10 on the ccd .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 form the position dependence and @xmath13 is the common offset at exposure @xmath14 . for each exposure",
    "we fit the three parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 using a robust estimator .",
    "next , we smooth the derived @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 temporal curves ( fig .",
    "[ guterman : fig3 ] ) , and then subtract the resulting @xmath7 model from each exposure of each star .     positions .",
    "the red line is the linear approximation of the dependence.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   positions .",
    "the red line is the linear approximation of the dependence.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]      several steps are necessary to process the corot data .",
    "1 .   resynchronising the run data + the corot data is a collection of files , each containing the run light curve of a single star .",
    "we pack all the files of a run into a single matrix of @xmath18 that contains the whole data of that run .",
    "the difficulty is that although simultaneously acquired , the time label of an exposure differs across files , depending on star position and roundoff errors among others .",
    "consequently we had to gather all measurements within a common 4 @xmath19 interval across the whole file set as belonging to the same exposure .",
    "2 .   binning to 512 @xmath19 + some of the stars are sampled at a 32 @xmath19 cadence while the rest are at 512 @xmath19 cadence . a 512 @xmath19 measurement is the onboard concatenation of 16 successive 32 @xmath19 exposures .",
    "the timestamp is the center of the exposure interval in both cases .",
    "the present step consists on binning the data matrix to a common 512 @xmath19 time frame in the same way that corot would have done onboard .",
    "3 .   deriving the effects",
    "coefficients + we compute the residual of each star ( eq .  [ eqresid ] ) and produce the residual matrix of the run .",
    "then , for each exposure @xmath14 of that matrix , we estimate the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath13 ( eq .  [ eqmodel ] ) using robust multi - linear regression @xcite .",
    "this way , the procedure is insensitive to outliers due to spurious cosmic rays or stellar variability .",
    "another benefit of such an estimator is that there is no need to select a training set .",
    "+ the resulting @xmath21 and @xmath17 temporal coefficients are then strongly smoothed using a 30 days sliding average to remove high - frequency noise caused by the fitting process and modeling imperfections .",
    "[ guterman : fig3 ] shows the temporal evolution of the @xmath22 coefficients for _",
    "lrc01_. + ; green-@xmath15 ( @xmath23 dependence ) ; red-@xmath16 ( @xmath24 dependence ) .",
    "the magnified section illustrates finer details on a shorter time scale which we ignore .",
    "the time is the number of days since the beginning of the run.,scaledwidth=70.0% ] 4 .   removing the systematic effects model + we derive the @xmath7 matrix ( eq .  [ eqmodel ] ) and subtract it from the residual matrix .",
    "the resulting residuals are then reverted back to light curves through the inverse of eq .",
    "[ eqresid ] .",
    "this part is performed by the production pipeline that stores the result into a specific extend of the legacy _ fits _ files .",
    "this process takes place after the gap filling and the jumps corrections stages .",
    "[ guterman : fig3 ] shows the evolution of the model coefficients during the 142 days of run _",
    "lrc01_. in blue , the common offset coefficient @xmath17 shows that all light curves gradually looses up to 37@xmath5 during the 142 days of the run .",
    "this long - term trend may reflect the loss of efficiency of the ccd , attributed to aging effects . in red ( green ) ,",
    "the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) coefficients @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) show patterns of lower amplitude , probably caused by the star shift inside its mask , probably due to small rotational depointing or aberration .",
    "the larger value of the @xmath16 coefficient ( red ) relative to the @xmath15 coefficient ( green ) could come from stretching of the corot psf along the @xmath23 direction @xcite .",
    "thus , a small displacement in the @xmath24 direction influences the signal proportionally more than the same displacement along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "a change of the ccd temperature is visible as a discontinuity at @xmath25 days , particularly in the red curve .",
    "smaller details are visible down to the order of 1@xmath5 in the 1.5-day magnified section .",
    "the faster oscillations are the residual of the corot satellite orbital period , namely 13.97 day@xmath26 .",
    "a daily pattern variation is also clearly visible .",
    "although interesting for analysis purposes , such details are removed from the operational coefficients by the smoothing process , because the model is not accurate enough for these patterns .",
    "[ guterman : fig4 ] shows the flux loss histograms in _",
    "lrc01 _ before and after the correction , and illustrates that our method efficiently corrects the flux decrease . before correction ( solid line ) , the overall difference @xmath27 spreads around 2% loss in 142 days .",
    "this 2% loss is equivalent to @xmath28 , assuming an average mask area . after correction ( dashed line ) , in addition to removal of the bias , the histogram is sharper .",
    "this reduction of differences between stars illustrates the effectiveness of the position based approach .",
    "while this method is efficient on average , visual inspection of many stars reveals its limitations . for many stars ,",
    "the systematics model nicely fits the light curve .",
    "however , for other stars over / under corrections can be seen .",
    "we tested several possibilities for explaining this .",
    "we checked the influence of the photometric masks geometry with collective depointing .",
    "for this , we used the full pixel images recorded before the run .",
    "we also checked the smearing due to readout pattern across columns .",
    "we even performed a blind search for correlations with combinations of available parameters like spectral type , magnitude , mask surface and others .",
    "eventually we were not able to identify any additional factor that could explain the suspected over / under correction .",
    "we present a simple method to remove systematics from the light curves of the corot satellite without altering the scientific information .",
    "we apply a 3 parameter linear model per exposure to identify and correct most long - term systematics .",
    "the robust estimation algorithm allows to use the full information of the corot sample of a run without selecting a training subset .",
    "the derived systematics only depend on the stellar position and mask area and not on the corresponding light curve . consequently , no fitting based on the light curve itself can modify the real stellar variation , even when it resembles the systematics profile .    as an example , we show that the @xmath0 long - term variation of the early _ lrc01 _ is nicely detrended on average , and the spread of stars variations is reduced . this systematics removal process is part of the corot _ legacy",
