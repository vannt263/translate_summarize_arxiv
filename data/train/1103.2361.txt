    "near field heat transfer  @xcite between closely spaced isotropic media has been intensively studied since it has been predicted that the heat flux at nanoscale can exceed the far - field limit of the planck s blackbody theory by orders of magnitude  @xcite . when considering dielectrics , surface phonon polaritons provide additional enhancement as discussed in refs .",
    "several experiments have recently confirmed the theoretical predictions for simple systems  @xcite .    with the modern techniques of nanofabrication it is now possible to explore a whole new level of complexity in material science and to fabricate artificial materials that can exhibit a considerable diversity of optical properties  @xcite .",
    "in many situations , these composite media possess privileged orientations so that their electromagnetic response depends on the direction of photons propagation .",
    "when the photon s wavelength in such a medium is large compared to the size of its representative unit cell , the latter behaves effectively like an anisotropic material and therefore may be described by an effective permittivity tensor ( and , when necessary , an effective permeability as well ) .",
    "this naturally points to the question of how anisotropy influences the near - field heat transfer .    in this work",
    ", we address this question in the particular case of two semi - infinite uniaxial media characterized by optical axes orthogonally oriented with respect to the surface of interaction .",

    "next , we compare in sec .  v the near - field heat exchanges between two uniaxial media to the classical ones between two isotropic media . finally , in order to explain the difference in the behavior of isotropic and anisotropic materials , we discuss in sec",

    "the evanescent waves are damped as @xmath62 \\approx \\exp ( -(2 \\pi / a ) d ) $ ] in the non - retarded near - field region above the porous material .",
    "it follows that the contribution to the heat flux is dominated by evanescent waves with lateral wavelength larger than @xmath58 if @xmath63 . on the other hand",
    ", one can argue that a nonlocal model for the permittivity is necessary if the lateral wave vectors @xmath64 are on the order of @xmath65 . since the exponential in the transmission coefficient in eq .",

    "let us study the surface waves supported by these media when they are sufficiently far away from each other so that any coupling of evanescent waves can be neglected . by definition",

    "once that the surface modes are determined by @xmath74 it is straightforward to verify that in this case only the second equation above can be satisfied , meaning that only p - polarized surface waves can exist at the interface of these media .",
    "solving that equation explicitly for @xmath64 gives us the sought dispersion relation of surface waves @xmath75 but one must be aware that ( [ eq : disp ] ) has _ two _ branches , and only one is connected to surface modes vanishes . ] . since their dispersion relation involves @xmath76 and @xmath77 , these waves are also called extraordinary surface waves  @xcite , and they reflect the material anisotropy . when @xmath78 , eq .",

    "the relevance of this approximation can be checked by comparing fig .",

    "@xmath89 so that only evanescent modes can exist , and conversely , in the red zones we have @xmath90 and all modes are propagative . similarly the light line @xmath91 allows us to distinguish between the radiative ( propagative ) and the non - radiative ( evanescent ) modes inside the vacuum . notice that , in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) both @xmath92 and @xmath93 must be the same .",
    "in other words , frustrated modes can not satisfy the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) .",
    "now let us turn to the description of modes supported by our artificial structures . for low filling factors we note in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ( a ) the existence of two surface modes .",
    "the first one ( at a lower frequency ) corresponds to the classical surface phonon - polariton ( spp ) supported by a massive sic sample  @xcite .",
    "that surface mode is also present in isotropic sic .",
    "the most interesting feature of fig .  [ fig : disp ] ( a ) is , however , the appearance of a second surface mode at higher frequencies , because it is a signature of the anisotropic character of the material and therefore a direct consequence of the vacuum inclusions in the host medium . as the porosity increases , both surface waves split . beyond a critical filling factor between @xmath82 and @xmath56 ,",
    "the upper surface wave disappears as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfilling ] .",
    "nevertheless the spp which still exists continue to move toward the smaller frequencies , i.e. , to @xmath94 . above the light line , we see that the anisotropy gives rise to two different types of brewster modes . at high frequency",
    "we recognize the usual modes where the reflection coefficient [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rfilling ] ( a ) ] of the effective medium vanishes .",
    "in addition to these modes , different brewster modes appear depending on the value of filling factor . also , we see on the reflection curves ( fig .  [",
    "fig : rfilling ] ) that the christiansen point @xcite for which the reflectivity is zero for all @xmath64 does not depend on the porosity .",
    "indeed , an inspection of expressions ( [ eq : eps_par ] ) and ( [ eq : eps_perp ] ) shows that the condition for the christiansen point of the host material @xmath95 implies that @xmath96 and @xmath97 so that , according to ( [ eq : rp ] ) , the reflection coefficients vanish .",
    "before we discuss the influence of the inclusions on the heat flux , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : poyntingisotrop ] the results of the mean poynting vector @xmath98 between two semi - infinite sic bodies at fixed temperatures @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "first of all one can see that the heat flux becomes very large for distances much smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath101 ( which is about @xmath102 for @xmath103 ) . at @xmath104",
    "the heat flux for the two sic bodies is about @xmath105 times larger than the heat flux between two black bodies .",
    "this increase is due to the frustrated total internal reflection and to the coupled surface phonon polariton modes  @xcite . in the propagating regime ,",
    "i.e. , for distances larger than @xmath106 the heat flux is determined by kirchhoff - planck s law and is limited by the black - body value .",
    "note , that the heat flux is dominated by the p - polarized modes for distances smaller than @xmath68 and larger than @xmath107 , whereas for distances in between it is dominated by the s - polarized modes .",
    "now , we introduce the inclusions by using the maxwell - garnett expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps_par ] ) and ( [ eq : eps_perp ] ) .",
    "we use the same filling factor for both materials , so that we have a symmetric situation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : poyntingporous ] we show the resulting heat flux normalized to the values for the two non - pourous sic plates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poyntingisotrop ] .",
    "we find that for distances smaller than @xmath68 and larger than @xmath108 the heat flux becomes larger when we add air inclusions , whereas for intermediate distances the heat flux is reduced .    in order to see how the s- and p - mode contribution is changed by the porosity",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : poyntingporoussp ] ( a ) and ( b ) the plots for the separate contributions of s- and p - polarized modes .",
    "it is clear that the p - polarized part of the heat flux gets enhanced for all distances when compared to the isotropic case , regardless of the filling factor .",
    "the s - polarized part in turn gives a larger heat flux for distances larger than about @xmath108 and a smaller heat flux for distances smaller than @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , the smaller heat flux found in fig .",
    "[ fig : poyntingporous ] for intermediate distances is associated to the dominance of s - polarized modes in that distance regime .    in summary , by introducing inclusions",
    "we find for large and small distances an increase of the heat flux .",
    "for the propagating regime ( @xmath109 ) this can be understood from a simple argument : the vacuum holes simply dilute the material so that , according to kirchhoff s law , the reflectivity is decreased and hence the emissivity is increased .",
    "in fact , for @xmath110 one would retrieve the black body result , since in this case the reflectivity is zero . on the other hand",
    ", there is no such simple argument for the increased heat flux in the near - field region . here",
    ", it is necessary to study how the coupled surface modes , which give the main contribution to the heat flux for distances smaller than @xmath68 , are influenced by the introduction of the inclusions .",
    "this will be done by inspection of the transmission coefficient in the next section .",
    "as mentioned before , for the small distance regime ( @xmath111 ) the heat flux between two isotropic semi - infinite sic - bodies is solely dominated by the p - polarized contribution .",
    "this remains true for the porous sic bodies .",
    "in fact , the dominance of the p - polarized contribution becomes even greater with increasing filling factors .",
    "hence , to understand the observation that by introducing some porosity the heat flux becomes larger , it suffices to study the p - polarized contribution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_omega_kappa ] we show the transmission coefficient @xmath112 in the @xmath113-plane for different filling factors and a distance @xmath114 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_omega_kappa ] ( a ) one can see @xmath112 for two isotropic sic plates . here",
    ", @xmath112 is one or close to one for the propagating modes , the total internal reflection modes and the coupled surface phonon polaritons . in the plotted region one can mainly see the coupled surface phonon polaritons , which are responsible for the large heat flux at small distances .",
    "now , for @xmath81 one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_omega_kappa ] ( b ) that a second coupled surface mode appears due to the air inclusions .",
    "in addition , the coupled surface mode of the bulk sic is shifted to smaller frequencies . when increasing the filling factor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_omega_kappa ] ( c ) and ( d ) ] the upper coupled surface modes shift to higher frequencies and become less important for the transmission coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the low frequency surface modes shift further to lower frequencies . between the two coupled surface mode branches a band of frustrated internal reflection modes",
    "is formed which gives also a non - negligible contribution to the transmission coefficient .    in order to get further information we now consider the spectral mean poynting vector @xmath115 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectralpoynting ] ) for p - polarization only .",
    "we have plotted this quantity in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspectral ] at the same distance as before , i.e. , @xmath114 , and again for different filling factors . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission_omega_kappa ] one can see the strong contribution of the two coupled surface mode resonances , which are shifted in frequencies when changing the filling factor .",
    "furthermore , one can now observe , that when increasing the filling factor the low frequency resonance is not only shifted to smaller frequencies , but the resonance is also getting stronger .    the study can now be completed when considering the mean transmission factor for the p - polarized modes , that was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it represents the mean transmission coefficient of a mode specified by it s wave vector @xmath64 for a given temperature @xmath119 and a small temperature difference @xmath120 between the two bodies . by means of this quantity",
    "the heat flux can be rewritten in a landauer - like form  @xcite @xmath121 note , that for @xmath122 and @xmath28 the transmission coefficient @xmath112 is exponentially damped [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmissioncoeff ] ) ] and therefore also the mean transmission factor @xmath123 .",
    "this damping determines the wave vector cutoff and hence the number of states contributing to the heat flux .",
    "now , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] we plot @xmath123 for a given distance of @xmath114 and different filling factors normalized to the mean transmission factor for two semi - infinite sic bodies",
    ". for @xmath81 the mean transmission coefficient for the porous sic increases for intermediate @xmath64 but decreases for very large @xmath64 .",
    "the increased mean transmission factor is due to the second coupled surface mode and the frustrated modes , whereas the lower value for large wave vectors can be attributed to a stronger cutoff in the transmission coefficient , which means that the number of contributing modes is decreased .",
    "the enhancement of the transmission factor due to the surface mode prevails and leads to an enhanced heat flux at that distance .",
    "the same mechanism is responsible for the enhanced heat flux for @xmath82 . on the other hand , for larger filling factors",
    "the curves change slightly for intermediate @xmath64 compared to the curve for @xmath82 .",
    "the contribution in that intermediate region is due to the second coupled surface mode branch and the frustrated modes .",
    "but for very large @xmath64 the mean transmission coefficient increases compared to @xmath82 .",
    "this means that by introducing a higher porosity we soften the cutoff of the transmission coefficient .",
    "hence , the number of modes contributing to the heat flux is increased and results for large filling factors in a further enhanced heat flux .",
    "the dependence of the cutoff on the filling factor for large @xmath64 can easily be discussed for the transmission coefficient @xmath124 .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the cutoff region , i.e. , where @xmath124 is exponentially damped , is given by @xmath125 when considering two isotropic semi - infinite bodies at the surface mode resonance frequency [ see also refs .",
    "@xcite ] . for the uniaxial anisotropic case",
    "as considered here , this relation changes to @xmath126 where the permittivities have to be evaluated at the surface mode resonance frequency of the semi - infinite anisotropic body ( see appendix b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutoff ] we show a plot of @xmath127 over the filling factor .",
    "it is seen that by introducing the air inclusions the cutoff first decreases and then monotonically increases .",
    "this is the same qualitative behavior as observed for the mean transmission factor @xmath123 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] for @xmath122 .",
    "this reasoning confirms that the number of contributing modes is the main mechanism for increasing the heat flux at small distances and large filling factors ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of near and far field heat transfer between two flat uniaxial media made of polar materials ( in our case , sic ) in which cylindrical inclusions drilled orthogonally to surfaces are uniformally distributed .    after applying the classical stochastic electrodynamic theory to anisotropic materials",
    "we have shown that , for short distances , the heat flux between such media can be significantly larger than those traditionally measured between two isotropic materials in the same non - equilibrium thermal conditions . for small filling factors we have determined that this enhancement stems from additional surface waves arising at the uniaxial material - vacuum interface , clearly indicating that such increase is intrinsically connected to anisotropy . indeed , we did calculations for isotropically rarified sic plates with low filling factors ( @xmath129 ) and found that the heat transfer modification for is much smaller .",
    "in contrast , for larger filling factors ( @xmath128 ) we have shown that , after a thorough analysis of the transmission factor , the enhancement in heat transfer arises mainly from the increased number of modes contributing to the flux .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of near - field heat transfer between two anisotropic materials separated by a small vacuum gap and maintained in a stationary non - equilibrium thermal situation . by combining standard stochastic electrodynamics and the maxwell - garnett description for effective media , </S>",
    "<S> we show that heat flux can be significantly enhanced by air inclusions . </S>",
    "<S> this result is explained by : ( a ) the presence of extraordinary surface waves that give rise to supplementary channels for heat transfer throughout the gap , ( b ) an increase in the contribution given by the ordinary surface waves at resonance , ( c ) and the appearance of frustrated modes over a broad spectral range . </S>"
