    "the recent measurement of the muonic hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) lamb shift , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 and the associated determination of the electromagnetic proton radius : @xmath6 fm has led to a lot of controversy .",
    "the reason is that this number is 4 - 7@xmath2 away from previous determinations of this quantity coming from hydrogen and electron - proton ( @xmath7 ) scattering @xcite .    in order to asses the significance of this discrepancy",
    "it is of fundamental importance to perform the computation of this quantity in a model independent way . in this respect ,",
    "the use of effective field theories ( efts ) is specially useful .",
    "they help organizing the computation by providing with power counting rules that asses the importance of the different contributions .",
    "this becomes increasingly necessary as higher order effects are included .",
    "even more important , these power counting rules allow to parametrically control the size of the higher order non - computed terms and , thus , give an estimate of the error .",
    "the eft approach is specially convenient in the case of bound states where there are different , well separated scales , namely , the hard scale or reduced mass ( @xmath8 ) , the soft scale or typical momentum ( @xmath9 ) and the ultrasoft scale or typical binding energy ( @xmath10 ) .      in our approach",
    "we combine the use of heavy baryon effective theory ( hbet ) @xcite , non - relativistic qed ( nrqed ) @xcite and , specially , potential nrqed ( pnrqed ) @xcite . partial results following this approach can be found in @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . in ref .",

    "the main contribution is the electron vacuum polarization at @xmath17 .",
    "the remaining amount corresponds to higher order effects such as higher loops , relativistic corrections , ultrasoft photons or perturbation theory effects . a more detailed description ( with comprehensive references ) of this contribution",

    "the 14th entry of the table corresponds to the hadronic vacuum polarization ( encoded in the matching coefficient @xmath20 ) , which can be determined from dispersion relations ( dr ) @xcite with a small error for our purposes , and this is the number we quote here .",
    "the last entry of table [ table ] corresponds to the two photon exchange ( tpe ) and deserves more care since it generates most of the uncertainty in the lamb shift .",

    "we have computed both of them separately , in the pure chiral limit and also including the contribution due to the @xmath23 , which could give the largest subleading contribution not only for being the closest resonance to the proton , but also because both of them are degenerate in the large-@xmath24 limit @xcite .",
    "when going from hbet to nrqed , we integrate out the pions and the delta and we can write @xmath25 , where no counterterms are needed to compute the leading order of the contribution , as it is argued in refs . @xcite .",

    "this is a valuable information for eventual lattice simulations of these quantities where one can tune these parameters .",
    "we can extract the contribution of the born term to the energy shift from eq .",

    "the first two entries correspond to two different dr - analyses .",
    "note that in the hbet computation the addition of the delta has a good convergence .",
    "on the other hand , our result is much smaller than the standard ones obtained from dr . whether this discrepancy is due to relativistic corrections or to a need for refining the fitting procedure",

    "[ fig1 ] for the pure chiral case and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] both for the tree level delta exchange ( top diagram ) and for the one - loop delta contribution .",

    "@xmath34    the polarizability energy shift can not be fully obtained from dr and thus , needs some subtractions .",
    "this fact makes our model independent computation even more relevant .",
    "the lamb shift obtained in hbet is : [ epol ] e_=()^3=18.51()-1.58()+9.25()=26.2(10.0 )    @xmath35    in table [ table : epol ] , we compare our hbet results to others obtained by a combination of dr for the inelastic term and different modelling functions for the subtraction term , and also to the result obtained using b@xmath36pt .",
    "this last one is carried out within a theory that treats the baryon relativistically .",
    "the result incorporates some subleading effects , which are sometimes used to give an estimate of higher order effects in hb@xmath36pt , but it also assumes that a theory with only baryons and pions is appropriate at the proton mass scale , which should be taken with due caution . still , it would be desirable to have a deeper theoretical understanding of this difference , which may signal that relativistic corrections are important for the polarizability correction . in any case",
    ", the b@xmath36pt computation differs from our chiral result by around 50% which we consider reasonable .            for the total tpe energy shift",
    "we obtain : e_tpe = e_born+e_pol = 28.59()+5.86(&)=34.4(12.5 ) , which , however is in good agreement with the total result @xcite used for the determination of the proton radius in @xcite .",
    "this result is a pure prediction of the eft , and it is also the most precise result that can be obtained in a model independent way since @xmath37 effects are not controlled by the chiral theory and would require new counterterms .",
    "we have computed in a completely model independent way the lamb shift for @xmath13 in muonic hydrogen , which allows for the extraction of the proton radius , focusing on the hadronic contributions ( mainly the tpe ) .",
    "our result of the proton radius is @xmath38 away from the codata value and has much larger uncertainties .",
    "we have computed the pure chiral contribution to the tpe , and also the contribution due to the @xmath39 .",
    "this computation of the tpe gives a similar result to the one obtained by the combination of dr plus the use of different models .",
    "however , the partial computations ( born and polarizability ) differ from the partial results obtained in these frameworks , fact that should be further understood .",
