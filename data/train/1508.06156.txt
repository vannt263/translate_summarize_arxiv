    "remobilization concerns the in - vessel release of dust residing away from its production site , whereas the general term mobilization also includes the release of dust upon creation ( cracking , melt layer splashing , delamination , arcing ) .",
    "it has been long realised that dust remobilization is a major safety issue for iter and future fusion devices , owing to the possibility of radioactive or toxic dust release upon loss of vacuum accidents ( lovas)@xcite . in such scenarios , air ingress in the vacuum vessel creates an outward flow after pressure equilibration which leads to hydrodynamic forces that can potentially mobilize dust grains@xcite .",
    "moreover , dust remobilization upon disruptions has been consistently observed in multiple tokamaks by cameras@xcite and other diagnostics@xcite . in such cases ,",
    "vibrations of plasma - facing components ( pfcs ) , thermal shocks@xcite or large currents induced by fast transients most probably provide the mobilizing forces .",
    "finally , dust can also be remobilized in normal operating conditions by plasma forces . regardless of the scenario ,",
    "remobilization is a consequence of momentum imbalance in the `` dust - pfc contact '' .",
    "hence , the main differentiating factor between remobilization in lovas , disruptions and normal operating conditions is the mobilizing force or torque .    deeper understanding of the mechanism of remobilization by plasma forces can play an important role in diverse plasma - wall interaction issues .    * _ specification of realistic initial conditions for the ejection speed and angle of remobilized dust grains_. this will increase the predictive power of dust transport codes as far as the grain penetration depth and the amount of dust - associated impurities are concerned .",
    "consequently , this can lead to a more accurate modelling of transient impurity events@xcite , intense radiation spikes most likely associated with mobile dust re - distributed by a temporally adjacent disruptive discharge@xcite . *",
    "_ specification of realistic dust trajectory termination conditions_. so far , migraine is the only code that treats dust - wall interactions@xcite and thus has the potential to make predictions with respect to the in - vessel sites where dust will most likely accumulate .",
    "however , in the current version of migraine@xcite , dust trajectories terminate for impacts that satisfy the sticking condition since remobilization is not accounted for .",
    "we stress that identification of preferred dust accumulation sites is the first step in developing efficient _ in situ _ dust removal techniques . for instance , in iter , mechanical dust removal is envisaged and hence successful predictions of the location of such sites can lead to dust collection by the divertor remote handling system or the multi - purpose deployment system@xcite . * _ quantification of dust amassment in the grooves of castellated pfcs_. in iter , pfcs will be castellated , i.e. split into small segments separated by thin gaps@xcite .",
    "the gap entrance corresponds to a small fraction of the plasma - exposed area ( the gap width is @xmath0 mm ) , implying that dust trajectories directly terminating in the gaps can be considered rare .",
    "two mechanisms related with the physics of the dust - pfc contact can be more efficient : dust remobilization from neighbouring monoblocks ( provided that the release velocity is nearly tangential and low enough to ensure that the motion is governed not only by inertia but also by potential effects ) or dust impacting and subsequently rolling or sliding on neighbouring monoblocks .",
    "* _ evaluation of the gap trapping efficiency . _ a closely related issue concerns grains already residing in the gaps and in particular whether they are permanently stuck therein or can be remobilized during normal plasma conditions or by a disruption .    despite its importance",
    ", the remobilization of dust grains in normal operating conditions has not been properly considered thus far .",
    "there are no relevant experimental results , whereas previous theoretical investigations have either erroneously neglected the role of adhesion@xcite or adopted an oversimplifying description of the phenomenon@xcite . in this work",
    ", we carry out the first combined experimental and theoretical study of dust remobilization in fusion plasmas during normal operating conditions .",
    "the main theoretical aspects of remobilization are analyzed , the role of adhesion in both establishing and breaking the dust - pfc contact is highlighted , whereas generic remobilization conditions are formulated .",
    "an experimental technique is proposed based on controlled pre - adhesion of dust grains on samples and detailed mapping of the deposition profiles prior to and post plasma exposure .",
    "such a technique realistically mimics naturally occurring remobilization . proof - of - principle of the technique is provided by experiments with planar tungsten samples in the textor tokamak and the extrap - t2r reversed - field pinch .",
    "it is shown that plasma forces are sufficient to remobilize the grain and first quantitative estimates of the remobilization activity are performed .",
    "further experiments in the pilot - psi linear device enabled studies under varying plasma conditions and magnetic field topology .",
    "they were complemented by camera observations allowing for estimates of the ejection speed and angle .",
    "the theoretical analysis that follows is primarily focused on perfectly smooth surfaces and isolated spherical grains .",
    "the influence of non - ideal effects such as surface roughness and agglomerates is briefly discussed at the end of each subsection .      before delving into the physics of remobilization ,",
    "it is essential to discuss how dust gets originally stuck on plasma facing components .",
    "this is a crucial design element of controlled remobilization experiments , since , in order to allow for reliable extrapolations , dust grain deposition on samples needs to mimic dust sticking on pfcs as it naturally occurs in fusion environments . for a dust grain impinging obliquely on a smooth surface , when the normal impact velocity is smaller than a critical value known as the sticking velocity @xmath1 , all the normal kinetic energy of the grain is dissipated into adhesive work and plastic deformation .",
    "consequently , the rebound velocity will be purely tangential and , in absence of strong external forces , it will slowly decrease owing to kinetic friction , until the dust grain is completely immobilized .    as has been discussed in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the typical impact duration ( @xmath2ns for the sizes of concern in this work ) is sufficiently short to justify neglecting the work of plasma forces as compared to the impact energy of the dust grain and the total interface energy , _",
    "i.e. _ the work necessary to separate the two surfaces from contact to infinity . as we shall see in the following subsection , not only the work but also the normal component of the plasma forces themselves is negligible .",
    "thus , while plasma defines the dust acceleration and bulk temperature ( and hence the plastic dissipation upon collisions ) , the impact itself can be considered as purely mechanical .",
    "this opens up the way for a treatment of dust - pfc collisions with established impact mechanics models@xcite .",
    "an analytical model of the normal component of elastic - perfectly plastic adhesive impacts originally developed by thornton and ning ( t&n model)@xcite has proved to be successful not only in reproducing experimental data obtained in vacuum@xcite but also in explaining the general trends of experimental data obtained in plasma environments@xcite . the t&n model has been recently incorporated in the migraine dust dynamics code@xcite . in the t&n model , sticking is essentially controlled by two characteristic velocities , the adhesive velocity associated with adhesive work and the yield velocity associated with plastic work .",
    "the _ adhesive velocity _ is the maximum impact velocity for which an elastic - adhesive impact leads to zero rebound velocity . for such impacts ,",
    "sticking is a consequence of the irreversible work of microscopic attractive inter - particle forces .",
    "therefore , the adhesive velocity can be found by equating the normal impact kinetic energy of the grain with the total inelastic work carried out throughout the impact , from the initiation of the contact up to the separation of the surfaces of the colliding bodies .",
    "it naturally depends on the adhesive theory employed . within the johnson - kendall - roberts theory@xcite , that is assumed in the t&n model , it is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the interface energy per unit area",
    ", @xmath5 is the dust mass density , @xmath6 is the dust radius and @xmath7 is the reduced young s modulus .",
    "the size dependence of the adhesive velocity is explicit .",
    "the _ yield velocity _ is the minimum impact velocity for which a pure elastic impact starts to become plastic . for the onset of plastic deformation beneath the contact region , the pressure at any point",
    "needs to exceed a limiting contact pressure @xmath8 that is proportional to the yield strength @xmath9 of the material . for hertzian profiles",
    "the maximum of the pressure is attained at the center of the contact area and the above criterion leads to a limiting contact radius @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the yield velocity can be found by equating the normal impact kinetic energy of the grain with the elastic energy stored in the contact @xmath11 at a penetration depth @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath13 there is an implicit size dependence that is incorporated in @xmath8 .",
    "material properties and especially the yield strength strongly depend not only on the bulk dust temperature @xmath14 but also on the dust size .",
    "in fact , for metallic dust , as far as the onset of plastic deformation is concerned , there is a competition between the enhanced plasticity of heated metals and the high yield strength of micrometer - scale bodies .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 dependencies for tungsten and beryllium have been described in ref.@xcite .    .",
    "notice that two solutions of the equation @xmath17 exist . for dust grains with radii that belong to the interval between the two solutions , @xmath18 and",
    "plastic deformation affects sticking .",
    "( b ) plot of the dust threshold radius as a function of the dust bulk temperature . for w dust impinging on w samples",
    "@xmath19 mm for any temperature , while for be dust impinging on be samples @xmath20m.,width=3 ]    based on the value of these characteristic velocities , two distinct sticking realizations emerge .",
    "when @xmath21 , plastic deformation does not occur during sticking impacts and the sticking velocity is equal to the adhesive velocity , @xmath22 . on the other hand , when @xmath18 , plastic work affects sticking and the sticking velocity is larger than the adhesive velocity , @xmath23 . in order to distinguish between the two sticking realizations ,",
    "it is convenient to define the dust threshold radius @xmath24 that corresponds to the dust size for which the adhesive velocity and the yield velocity are equal . in ref.@xcite , the dependence of mechanical properties on @xmath25",
    "was not taken into account , which led to a single value of the dust threshold radius .",
    "including these dependencies , we observe that for each value of the bulk dust temperature there exist two solutions of the equation @xmath17 , see figure [ plastic](a ) .",
    "the smaller solution is of no interest since it always lies in the nanometer scale ; it is a manifestation of the hall - petch strengthening effect and demonstrates that for nano - sized dust plastic deformation is difficult to induce .",
    "therefore , we shall identify the larger solution as the dust threshold radius @xmath24 : for @xmath26 plastic deformation has no effect in sticking .",
    "the threshold radius is plotted in figure [ plastic](b ) as a function of the dust bulk temperature for w on w impacts and be on be impacts .",
    "we conclude that plastic deformation is always important for tokamak relevant impacts .",
    "owing to the dependence of plastic deformation on the impact energy , after the dust grain is immobilized , the details of the contact region will also depend on the normal component of the grain impact velocity .",
    "this dependence on the pre - history of the trajectory clearly implies that control of the impact velocity prior to sticking should be an essential ingredient of reliable remobilization experiments . for tokamak relevant materials ,",
    "the sticking velocity of @xmath27 m grains generally lies in the range @xmath28m / sec@xcite .",
    "the above analysis of the sticking impact regime is valid for perfectly smooth spherical grains impinging on perfectly smooth planar surfaces .",
    "we stress that the omnipresent surface roughness can strongly reduce the sticking velocity , see ref.@xcite for a concise description .",
    "finally , we point out that there is no theoretical description for non - spherical and non - planar colliding bodies .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall focus on the adhesive forces acting on the contact area that is established between the dust grain and the pfc after an impact in the sticking regime . for simplicity , we first assume perfectly smooth surfaces , spherical dust and planar pfcs as well as neglect plasticity",
    ". we shall analyze the elastic - adhesive contact with the aid of macroscopic contact mechanics .",
    "we introduce the hertzian elastic energy @xmath29 , the contact radius @xmath30 and the hertzian penetration depth or depth of indentation @xmath31@xcite . a heuristic approach developed by derjaguin@xcite",
    "assumes the validity of the hertzian elastic contact equations and simply includes adhesion as a negative energy contribution@xcite approximated by @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the total energy of the system will be @xmath33 and the contact force applied to the grain will be given by @xmath34 .",
    "pull - off is achieved at @xmath35 and the pull - off force , _",
    "i.e. _ the minimum external normal force required to separate the surfaces , is given by @xmath36 . despite its simplicity , this heuristic model is useful for order of magnitude estimates .",
    "in fact , in more elaborate theories of elastic - adhesive contact , the pull - off force always has the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 a dimensionless coefficient of the order of a few@xcite .",
    "for instance , in the johnson - kendall - roberts theory @xmath39@xcite , whereas in the derjaguin - muller - toporov theory @xmath40@xcite .",
    "the proportionality of the pull - off force with the dust radius highlights the dominant role of adhesion for micron - sized grains , since other forces acting on grains embedded in fusion devices scale either as @xmath41 or as @xmath42 ( see below ) .",
    "a similar proportionality also stems from microscopic descriptions of the contact@xcite . within the dlvo theory@xcite",
    ", the total interaction between any two surfaces can be decomposed into the net van der waals force , as calculated with the additivity approach of hamaker , and the electric double - layer force . for a sphere in contact with a flat surface ,",
    "both contributions are proportional to the radius of the sphere .",
    "we shall now compare the pull - off force with the main external forces ; the ion drag force , the electrostatic force and the gravitational force .",
    "the discussion is restricted to the typical case of perfect electrical contact between the dust grain and the pfc , _",
    "i.e. _ in absence of insulating layers in the contact region .",
    "the well - known expressions for the drag and electrostatic forces@xcite are not valid in our case , owing to the strong plasma inhomogeneity in the sheath and the effect of the boundary in binary collisions .",
    "nevertheless , we shall employ these formulas for order of magnitude estimates , since more appropriate analytical expressions are not available in the literature .",
    "they are anyways expected to significantly overestimate the actual magnitude of the forces involved and will hence serve as upper limit estimates .    for a homogeneous infinite maxwellian flowing plasma , the drag force due to the scattering of singly charged ions",
    "is given by@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ion mass , @xmath45 is the plasma density , @xmath46 is the ion thermal velocity , @xmath47 is the ion flow velocity , @xmath48 is the normalized dust potential , @xmath49 is the ion - to - electron temperature ratio , @xmath50 is the effective coulomb logarithm , @xmath51 and @xmath52/(2u^3)$ ] .",
    "similarly , for the drag force due to the absorption of ions we have @xmath53 .    for a perfectly spherical conducting grain lying on a conducting plane in the presence of a uniform normal electric field @xmath54 , the boundary value problem for the determination of the electrostatic potential has an analytical solution@xcite .",
    "for such a configuration , the laplace equation can be solved with the aid of degenerate bispherical coordinates and with one of the boundary conditions resulting from the constant behavior of the electric field at infinity . the contact charge of dust",
    "is given by @xmath55 and the normal electrostatic force acting on the grain is given by the formula @xmath56r_{\\mathrm{d}}^2e_{\\mathrm{w}}^2 $ ] or equivalently @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes riemann s zeta - function .",
    "we shall also consider the gravitational force @xmath59 .    in the parameter range relevant to the iter divertor conditions , we select favorable plasma conditions for the ion drag and electrostatic forces to be large , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60@xmath61 , @xmath62ev , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65kv / cm . we also assume relatively large tungsten dust of @xmath66 micron diameter ( several times larger than the median size of the tungsten grains collected in asdex upgrade@xcite ) . substituting the above parameters in eqs.([pulloff],[iondrag],[lebedev ] ) we end up with @xmath67 it is apparent that the pull - off force is orders of magnitude larger than the plasma forces and gravity .",
    "therefore , previous investigations of dust remobilization that neglected adhesion are unrealistic@xcite .",
    "let us now consider the influence of non - ideal effects : * ( i ) * plasticity will flatten out the grain increasing the contact area and thus the net adhesive force .",
    "in particular , permanent deformation of a spherical grain will lead to a local radius of curvature @xmath68 which will result to a stronger pull - off force of the form @xmath69@xcite . as mentioned in the previous subsection",
    ", @xmath70 depends on the dust radius as well as the impact velocity . *",
    "( ii ) * non - spherical dust grains and non - planar pfcs will also affect the contact .",
    "for a qualitative estimate it is useful to consider eq.([pulloff ] ) with the substitution @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the effective radius of curvature defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 the local radii of curvature of the grain and the pfc@xcite .",
    "apparently , pfc non - planarity will tend to decrease the pull - off force when the pfc can be approximated by a convex surface in the contact region ( positive @xmath75 ) and will tend to increase the pull - off force when the pfc can be approximated by a concave surface in the contact region ( negative @xmath75 ) .",
    "dust non - sphericity can also act both ways .",
    "we point out that , for non - spherical grains , the ion drag and the electrostatic force formulas also change , but generic expressions are not available in the literature . *",
    "( iii ) * nanometer scale roughness , _",
    "i.e. _ roughness consisting of asperities with dimensions much smaller than the size of the dust grain , is known to lead to a reduction of the contact area and consequently a reduction in the pull - off force only for stiff materials with large elastic moduli such as tungsten@xcite . on the other hand , micrometer scale roughness , _",
    "i.e. _ roughness consisting of asperities with dimensions of the order of the dust size , is equivalent to pfc non - planarity and its effect on the pull - off force will also depend on the sign of the local radius of curvature .",
    "we note that roughness can also affect the plasma sheath structure and consequently the plasma forces , when the asperity heights become comparable to the debye length .",
    "such a scenario can be realized in partially detached divertor plasmas that are characterized by large plasma densities and small temperatures@xcite .    to sum up , non - ideal effects",
    "can either increase or decrease the pull - off force of eq.([pulloff ] ) , but they can not account for the at least two orders of magnitude difference with the plasma forces , depicted in eq.([scaling ] ) .",
    "the only possible exception documented to be able to cause such a large decrease is nano - roughness@xcite .",
    "finally , it is important to make some remarks about the pull - off force between two spherical grains@xcite .",
    "this is relevant for the case of agglomerates , whose presence is unavoidable in our remobilization experiments . for spheres of radii @xmath76 ,",
    "it is given by @xmath77\\gamma$ ] , which results to @xmath78 therefore , not only adhesion is weaker in the sphere - sphere system than in the sphere - plane system but also the larger the size discrepancy the weaker the pull - off force .",
    "this is confirmed in our experiments , where it is systematically observed that agglomerates tend to break and remobilize easier than isolated grains .      in our discussion of the sticking impact regime",
    ", we neglected the effect of plasma forces based on energy budget arguments .",
    "moreover , in the previous subsection , we demonstrated that the pull - off force is orders of magnitude larger than plasma forces .",
    "however , plasma forces need to be responsible for remobilization , being essentially the only external forces exerted on the grain . in the formulation of remobilization conditions , due to the static nature of the problem",
    ", we can greatly benefit from the use of force diagrams .",
    "very similar force diagrams are encountered in the field of aerosol science in industrial problems related to the hydrodynamic removal of contaminant dust@xcite .",
    "the main difference is that remobilization in those cases is induced by strong laminar or turbulent gas flows and not by plasma .",
    "the forces on a dust grain stuck on the pfc are sketched in figure [ forcediagram ] .",
    "we neglect the gravitational force , since it is orders of magnitude smaller than the other forces .",
    "we also point out that for the typical case of small inclination angle of the magnetic field lines on the pfcs , there exist @xmath79 and diamagnetic drifts arising in the pre - sheath and sheath regions@xcite . therefore ,",
    "as has been pointed out when analyzing the dust motion near a boundary@xcite , ion flows of the same order exist in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this implies , also considering the flow direction not being an axis of symmetry and the strong inhomogeneity of the sheath , that plasma induced forces will have both tangential and normal components .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath80 for the force due to the scattering and absorption of ions , @xmath81 for the force acting on the dust grain due to the electrostatic field of the surrounding plasma sheath .",
    "notice that the force @xmath82 can be assumed to have a line of action traversing the center of mass of the grain , provided that the excess torque is compensated for by the so - called external moment of surface stresses about the center , denoted here by @xmath83@xcite .    .",
    "the pull - off force @xmath84 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the maximum value of the adhesive forces .",
    "the flattened and oversized contact radius is for pure illustrative purposes , in reality the shape of the contact area and of the deformed part of the sphere are complicated , with a so - called `` neck '' formation , see ref.@xcite for details.,width=307 ]    the other class of forces originates from the contact between the dust grain and the wall . in the normal direction ,",
    "adhesive forces @xmath85 are exerted .",
    "they resist any external forces tending to separate the contact between the bodies .",
    "the minimum external force necessary to separate the two surfaces is the pull - off force @xmath84 . in the tangential direction ,",
    "frictional forces @xmath86 are exerted .",
    "they resist any external forces inducing relative motion between the bodies in contact .",
    "the maximum of the net frictional force , or equivalently the minimum external force necessary to cause sliding between the bodies is the static friction @xmath87 .",
    "we assume the validity of amontons s law @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the coefficient of static friction and @xmath90 the normal component of the total force .",
    "it might seem contradictory to the reader that , even though we assume that both the dust grain and the wall are smooth surfaces , the coefficient of static friction is considered non - zero .",
    "in fact , in traditional theories@xcite , static friction is the consequence of surface asperity interlocking and arises from the dissipative processes that accompany the engagement / disengagement of micro - asperities .",
    "such a picture is outdated@xcite and it has been experimentally demonstrated that even smooth surfaces can exhibit strong friction owing to atomic forces and local deformation processes .",
    "we note that , also in microscopic theories , static friction preserves its proportionality with the normal component of the force , in accordance with amontons s law@xcite .",
    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath91 , the remobilization conditions can be found from force balance in the normal direction , force balance in the tangential direction and torque balance around the contact point@xcite : @xmath92 there is also the possibility of rotation around an axis parallel to the pfc surface normal ( the @xmath93axis in the coordinate system of fig.[forcediagram ] ) .",
    "this is not considered in a detailed manner , since during pure self - rotation the position of the center of mass of the spherical grain relative to the pfc does not change .",
    "following eq.([scaling ] ) , it is clear that the direct lift - up condition can not be easily realized in tokamaks under normal plasma conditions . on the other hand , owing to the small deformation due to adhesion @xmath94 the rolling condition is more easily realized .",
    "finally , it is hard to draw any conclusions for the sliding condition due to the involvement of the coefficient of static friction , that is difficult to quantify .    since the direct lift - up condition is hard to be satisfied in tokamaks",
    ", one could conclude that dust will remain on the wall once adhering to it .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of micron - roughness , implies that while dust might initially roll or slide , it could eventually attain a velocity component normal to the local surface , _ i.e. _ micron - roughness essentially acts as a ramp@xcite .",
    "moreover , micron - roughness can also alter the form of the remobilization conditions , since it can lead to multiple contact points .",
    "for instance , in case roughness controls the point of rotation , the lever arms of both tangential and normal forces will change leading to a different rolling condition .",
    "this is also relevant for small agglomerates , see refs.@xcite for details . on the other hand ,",
    "nano - roughness will not change the form of any of the remobilization conditions , it will only alter the numerical values of the pull - off force and the static friction coefficient .",
    "the remobilization experiments are realized by controlled adhesion of micron - size dust on metal samples via gas - dynamic methods , exposure of the samples to plasma , and detailed mapping of the samples before and after their exposure .",
    "controlled adhesion is achieved by a modified pellet injection system that launches dust grains with a pre - defined speed towards the metal surface .",
    "see figure [ dust_launch](a ) for a schematic drawing of the apparatus .",
    "dust grains are deposited at the upper face of the sabot , whose initial position lies at the bottom end of the acceleration barrel .",
    "low pressure @xmath95 mbar is set into both the upper and the lower chamber , until the opening of the air intake , which induces an air flow that accelerates the sabot with a law depending on the size of a calibrated duct .",
    "the sabot impacts on the top of the acceleration barrel and ejects the dust grains into the upper chamber .",
    "the initial time of the dust grain release is identified by an accelerometer mounted on the bottom wall of the upper chamber that monitors the impact of the sabot .",
    "ideally , the grain trajectory is purely deterministic , deceleration is caused by gravity and the initial velocity is equal to the sabot terminal speed .",
    "the grains follow a vertical path up to the metal target and , provided that their impact speed is lower than the sticking velocity , they adhere to the target .",
    "the impact speeds that can be achieved with the apparatus range from @xmath0 m/s up to @xmath96 m/s .",
    "there are two factors that lead to uncertainties in the impact speed .",
    "hydrodynamic forces associated with residual air in the upper chamber or with air leakages stemming from the lower chamber can slightly alter the force balance , whereas contact forces between the dust grains and the sabot can affect the initial velocity .",
    "consequently , the dust velocity is monitored with two laser beams focused on the chamber axis . for each of the two laser diodes , three silicon - pin - photodiodes",
    "( siemens , sfh 229 ) are mounted on the wall , the one facing the laser diode ( @xmath97 amplification factor ) gathers the whole beam , while two additional sensors ( @xmath98 amplification factor ) are placed at @xmath99 from the beam direction in order to collect the scattered light .",
    "as the grains traverse the upper chamber and cross the laser beams , the attenuation of the signals is detected by the photodiodes facing the laser diodes , whereas the scattered light is detected by the other two photodiodes .",
    "the additional data provided by the second laser diode allow for a correction that accounts for grain interaction with air .",
    "we also point out that the vertical configuration of the system ensures that the grains remain immobile during the sabot acceleration .",
    "a critical issue concerns the details of dust deposition at the sabot upper surface , which not only affect the total amount of released dust but can also lead to the undesired formation of agglomerates .",
    "this issue is of a great importance , particularly in the case of poly - disperse dust populations that include small size sub - populations of the order of @xmath100 m , since the latter have a strong tendency to form agglomerates when deposited on the sabot . a technique that reduces dust agglomeration",
    "is based on the use of glass spheres ( @xmath101 m in diameter ) .",
    "the glass spheres are deposited on the sabot with their surface preemptively loaded with dust grains , which they release to the target upon impact . after releasing the grains ,",
    "the glass spheres rebound and fall on the chamber bottom since their impact velocity @xmath102 m/s is much larger than their sticking velocity @xmath102mm / s .",
    "we shall refer to this technique as mediated adhesion in order to differentiate from direct adhesion .",
    "we note , though , that formation of some small dust clusters on the sample is unavoidable .      in order to facilitate the pre- and post - exposure analysis of the samples and allow for an unambiguous identification of the dust spread and losses upon plasma exposure , it is convenient to confine the location of the adhered grains to well - defined spots , _ i.e. _ circular large dust density spots with a sharp gradient at the edge .",
    "such a control of the dust deposition profiles is achieved by the use of specially designed holders and masks .",
    "the samples are thus encased in machined holders and held in place by masks bearing circular holes of assigned size at specified locations .",
    "two different holder / mask types were constructed , depending on the geometry of the samples , rectangular and circular .",
    "the rectangular mask bears two groups of four @xmath0 mm diameter holes , lying on a @xmath103 mm diameter circle , see figure [ dust_launch](b ) .",
    "the circular mask has a single central group of four @xmath0 mm diameter holes , placed symmetrically with respect to the center , see figure [ dust_launch](c ) . in both cases ,",
    "the thickness of the mask is decreased to @xmath0 mm in the vicinity the groups in order to favour the dust passage .",
    "the pre - deposited samples are mapped before and after plasma exposure , by means of a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) with a @xmath104 magnification factor , adequate to resolve the smallest grains and sufficient to contain the @xmath0 mm diameter dust spots in a single image .",
    "we note that a @xmath105 magnification factor ( pixel size @xmath106 m ) was used to collect images on the few spots where the grains are smaller than @xmath107 microns .",
    "the identification of remobilized grains was based on superimposing backscattered or secondary electron images before and after plasma exposure and implementing an image processing and analysis program , the nih image software@xcite . in order to allow for an absolute superposition of the images ,",
    "specific mechanical reference marks were added to all the samples .",
    "the remobilization activity for each sample is presented by such overlaid images with specific color coding .",

    "they have been treated in the same way as all other samples in terms of transportation , mounting on the device and vacuum exposure ( pumping down and venting ) but have not been exposed to the plasma .",
    "the reference samples are mapped before and after mounting in order to ensure that there is not any difference in the dust deposition profiles and hence that any kind of dust remobilization observed on the exposed samples is solely due to interaction with the plasma . moreover ,",
    "several tests on the strength of dust adhesion have been performed including for instance vibration in order to confirm that any accidental shaking of the sample will play no role in dust remobilization .",

    "the w grains are tekmat@xmath134 w-@xmath135 and were directly adhered to the w samples with impact velocities in the @xmath136 m/s range .",
    "the dust density in the spots was intentionally larger relative to the previous experiments in order to increase the number of trajectories observed by cameras and thus permit a reliable estimate of the characteristic ejection speed and angle .",
    "as in tokamaks@xcite , visualization is achieved by capturing the thermal radiation emitted by dust , as a consequence of the high surface temperature that the released as well as the adhered grains reach by absorbing plasma fluxes .",
    "trajectories of remobilized w grains were recorded with the aid of two high - speed cameras .",
    "the configuration of viewing ports allowed us to have two views on the w sample , perpendicular to each other , thus allowing for a stereoscopic reconstruction of the dust trajectories .",

    "both cameras were synchronized with the pilot - psi triggering system and had similar recording parameters : a frame rate of @xmath137frames / sec , a @xmath138s exposure time depending on the experimental conditions and a @xmath139m / px spatial resolution in the image plane .",
    "in addition , the `` side view '' camera was equipped with one h band - stop filter to filter out excessive plasma light emission in all the experiments , while the `` front view '' camera was equipped with a h band - stop filter only in the oblique configuration ( one filter of each kind was available for these experiments ) .",
    "the filters allowed us to track grains for a longer time as well as to detect less bright grains .",
    "the dust trajectories were reconstructed using the trace code@xcite .",
    "the videos were pre - processed in order to remove the background plasma light and maximize dust visibility . after background subtraction , nearly all light stemming from the plasma was removed from the frame , except from the high - contrast sample - plasma interaction region .",

    "notice that large variations arise in the values of @xmath151 for each sample , in spite of the fact that all three samples were exposed to identical plasma conditions , the plates had the same average roughness characteristics and the impact velocities were the same .",
    "these large variations stem from the different sampling of the original dust population during the loading of the sabot that leads to different size distributions being adhered to the plates ( see subsection [ controlledsubsection ] for details ) . the sampling is not totally random , since different ways were employed to load the sabot that can favor different sizes .",
    "thus , in few cases the sampling was observed to be strongly biased towards the largest dust sizes .",
    "the most biased case is that of the first sample .",
    "there , many adhered grains had diameters close to the maximum diameter present in the distribution , @xmath152 m , and formed agglomerates with smaller grains . on the contrary , in the third sample , even the largest adhered grains were typically smaller than @xmath153 m and most agglomerates consisted solely of smaller grains .",
    "the reader can observe these differences in the adhered populations by comparing animations s7 and s9 of the supplementary material .",

    "( b ) * the trajectory of a remobilized w grain with an initial nearly tangential ( to the oblique plate ) velocity and the calculated total speed as a function of time .",
    "shortly after the beginning of observation , there is a brief interval where the grain s kinetic energy is reduced , @xmath183ms up to @xmath184ms .",

    "( c ) * superposition of frames from camera observations depicting the two trajectories .",
    "it is evident from the brightness of the column that the plasma is quenched on the beginning of the oblique plate , before reaching the sample ( the dust set corresponds to the bright spot ) , which is mounted in the middle.,width=307 ]",
    "the present studies refer exclusively to metallic dust remobilization from metallic surfaces under normal operating conditions ( in absence of transient events ) with the grain motion triggered by the action of plasma forces . as will be discussed in details below , camera observations in pilot - psi clearly",
    "illustrate that dust remobilization takes place _ during plasma exposure_. this is further supported by the reference samples not exposed to plasma ( see also subsection [ dummysubsection ] ) , which never exhibited any remobilization activity .",
    "our textor and extrap - t2r experimental results confirmed that remobilization does take place under steady state plasma operation and revealed that the condition for the grain release is not easily satisfied , since only a relative small fraction of the exposed populations has remobilized and among those mostly larger grains and small clusters .",
    "the interpretation of the pilot - psi data greatly benefits from being complemented by camera observations and from the multiple exposure of samples to identical plasma conditions . the experimental evidence from this device",
    "allow us to draw the following rather important conclusion : for a given `` dust - pfc contact '' , there appears to be a condition to satisfy for remobilization to occur , in case it is not fulfilled in the beginning of the plasma exposure , then the grain shall remain adhered provided that the plasma conditions are stationary .",
    "let us elaborate on this further . in pilot - psi the rise time of the magnetic field pulse is @xmath102s , whereas the first plasma reaches the samples at @xmath185ms .",
    "subsequently , the plasma density gradually builds up to its maximum value which it attains at the plateau .",
    "our exposures have been complemented by camera observations in several but not all discharges and altogether we have observed @xmath186 trajectories , that correspond to a small fraction of the detached grains as determined by the post exposure sem analysis ( @xmath187 ) . according to the cameras , all the observed dust remobilization events take place between @xmath188 and @xmath189s of plasma exposure . since the dust surface temperature can only increase in time and the cameras observe the hottest dust@xcite , we can conclude that after a certain time no dust is released from the samples .",
    "this is strongly supported by the results of the re - exposure experiments .",
    "namely , even samples with drastic remobilization activity upon their first exposure , did not exhibit a single incidence of remobilization after re - exposure to an identical discharge .",
    "this implies that , as the plasma profiles build up , once the plasma forces become strong enough to satisfy any of the three remobilization conditions for some of the grains , these grains are immediately displaced and further exposure to similar conditions will not lead to any additional activity .    the remobilization experiments were carried out under varying plasma and surface conditions ( @xmath190m@xmath128 , @xmath191ev , @xmath192ev , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) . in such a wide range of experimental conditions , we have identified a clear dependence on the dust size . in accordance with the theory , larger grains and agglomerates tend to remobilize much easier than smaller grains @xmath196 m .",
    "consequently , smaller grains can be expected to have a longer lifetime on pfcs .",
    "this is particularly important , in view of recent dust studies in full metal tokamaks which have revealed that w grains with sizes @xmath196 m are the dominant component of the tungsten dust inventory .",
    "for instance , in dust collection activities from the full tungsten asdex upgrade@xcite the majority of w dust has sizes less than @xmath176 m with a most probable size @xmath197 m , whereas in the first dust studies from jet with the iter - like wall@xcite @xmath198 m is a typical size of w dust .",
    "we shall now view the theoretical estimates presented in section [ theorysection ] and the postulations about the three remobilization conditions in light of the experimental results .",
    "our calculations of the pull - off force strength indicate that it is hard for plasma forces acting along the surface normal to compensate for adhesion and that sliding or rolling can be realized easier than direct lift - up .",
    "however , overall , a significant number of grains were detached from the samples during plasma exposure .",
    "there are three possible explanations for this discrepancy : * ( i ) * micrometer scale roughness acts as a ramp .",
    "while the remobilized dust grains initially slide or roll , they soon encounter an asperity that redistributes the local normal and tangential velocity components causing detachment . *",
    "( ii ) * nanometer scale roughness decreases the ideal strength of the pull - off force by two orders of magnitude .",
    "theoretical models@xcite indicate that the influence of nano - roughness on adhesion depends on the value of the dimensionless adhesion parameter @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the mean asperity radius and @xmath201 is the standard deviation of asperity heights@xcite .",
    "according to experiments , for large values of the adhesion parameter , @xmath202 , the pull - off force can be decreased by at least one order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "such high values require that the materials have large young s moduli @xmath203 .",
    "in fact , refractory metals are characterized by large @xmath203 and especially tungsten has one of the largest values , @xmath204gpa . *",
    "( iii ) * there are additional plasma induced forces acting on the normal direction apart from the ion drag force and the electrostatic sheath force .",
    "we consider this possibility as unlikely to occur and mention it for the sake of completeness .",
    "some examples are forces due to thermal shocks or @xmath205 forces .",
    "camera observations in the pilot - psi experiments reported here support the first explanation , since they never revealed evidence of a direct lift - up . in the perpendicular configuration",
    "all grains moved radially along the sample surface , whereas in the oblique configuration the initial phase of trajectory was either pure tangential or with a dominant tangential component .",
    "however , as aforementioned , we did not manage to resolve the starting point of the trajectories . in further support of the first explanation ,",
    "there were events where the grains were either significantly or slightly displaced from their original position without leaving the sample .",
    "future dust remobilization experiments will focus on clarifying which of the three remobilization conditions is satisfied first .",
    "recently , we managed to drastically improve the camera resolution in the pilot - psi experiments to @xmath206m / pixel@xcite , which can assist in resolving dust trajectories closer to the remobilization instant as well as clarify whether the tangential trajectories observed are along the surface of the sample or along the plasma sheath .",
    "moreover , in experiments with mirror polished samples ( @xmath207 nm ) micron - roughness can be eliminated .",
    "finally , measurements of the pull - off force either by atomic force microscopy or by electrostatic mobilization can quantify the effect of nano - roughness for w on w adhesion .",
    "a quantitative analytical theory of dust remobilization is currently a formidable task .",
    "self - consistent modelling of remobilization requires a consideration of the influence of dust on the local plasma parameters . even for a single dust grain residing on the much larger pfc , while the global sheath structure will be unaffected , local effects will still be important owing to the strong dependence of the plasma forces on the micro - flows and on the details of the density profiles ( sheath within a sheath case ) .",
    "theoretical analysis can become even more complex for dust sizes comparable to the debye length , for multiple grains due to shadowing effects and agglomerates , for roughness values comparable to the debye length or for castellated pfcs .",
    "however , the static nature of the phenomenon implies that particle - in - cell numerical modelling@xcite is a viable candidate that can provide quantitative results .",
    "such investigations will be the subject of future work .    in view of such theoretical difficulties , controlled",
    "dust remobilization experiments in fusion environments are essential .",
    "the experimental technique proposed herein not only realistically mimics naturally occurring sticking impacts , but also allows for an unambiguous quantification of the dust remobilization activity .",
