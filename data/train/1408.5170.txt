    "shape evolution of krypton isotopes have attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical interest in the past  @xcite .",
    "such an evolution is rather complex and can be understood as a consequence of the various shell gaps found in the nilsson single particle energies .",
    "the existence of these gaps produces energy landscapes with more than one equilibrium shape .",
    "hence , the most energetically favored intrinsic configuration can change abruptly by adding neutrons , producing shape transitions along the isotopic chain .",
    "furthermore , shape coexistence can occur if different configurations originate collective bands with @xmath5 band - heads close in energy .",
    "additionally , these configurations can be mixed and the degree of mixing can be determined by the distortion of the rotational / vibrational behavior of the corresponding bands and by the transitions between states of different bands . + in the neutron deficient side ,",
    "fingerprints of shape coexistence as low - lying @xmath6 excited states  @xcite , shape mixing as the distortion of low - lying bands  @xcite , as well as spectroscopic quadrupole moments and electromagnetic transitions  @xcite have been measured , supporting the possible coexistence of a prolate band and an oblate band for these nuclei .",
    "in addition , the experiments suggest that the shape transition occurs from an oblate @xmath7kr to prolate @xmath8kr ground states , although , based on recent coulomb excitation measurements , a prolate character of the @xmath9 state in @xmath7kr have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the onset of deformation in the neutron rich isotopes around the region @xmath10 is the subject of recent studies  @xcite .",
    "hence , while for sr and zr isotopes a quite sharp transition from spherical to deformed configurations in @xmath11 is observed , the neutron rich kr isotopes do not show such a rapid change .",
    "furthermore , shape coexistence is found experimentally by the occurrence of two and three @xmath5 excited states below 2 mev with strong @xmath12 transitions in @xmath13sr and @xmath14zr , respectively ( @xmath15 )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no experimental data currently available for kr isotopes in this region .",
    "+ from the theoretical point of view , early self - consistent mean field studies have already shown a rich shape evolution in this region by analyzing the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) obtained with skyrme  @xcite , relativistic  @xcite and gogny  @xcite interactions .",
    "however , spectroscopic information can not be obtained within a pure mean field approach and several methods have been applied to calculate excitation energies , electromagnetic properties , etc . due to the huge number of possible configurations , conventional large scale shell model calculations are still out of reach in this region .",
    "nevertheless , results using the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) approach with a pairing plus quadrupole interaction  @xcite , the vampir method with an effective @xmath16-matrix defined in a reduced valence space  @xcite and the five dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) , also with a pairing plus quadrupole interaction  @xcite , have been reported .",
    "+ additionally , there are several methods based on self - consistent underlying mean fields that have been applied to compute spectroscopic properties .",
    "recently , a version of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) has been used to study the shape dynamics of neutron rich kr isotopes  @xcite . in this case , the parameters of the ibm hamiltonian are found by mapping the mean field energy surfaces obtained with the gogny d1 m interaction to the corresponding ibm ones .",
    "the results reproduce quite well the available experimental data and they are consistent with a smooth triaxial - to - oblate transition around @xmath17 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the 5dch method has been also used to study the low - lying spectroscopy in this region . here ,",
    "the inertial parameters and the potential energy of a bohr collective hamiltonian are extracted from an underlying mean field , based on gogny  @xcite or relativistic  @xcite interactions .",
    "then , such a reduced problem is solved and the energy levels , moments and transitions are computed .",
    "the agreement with the available data is also good with both gogny and relativistic interactions . in particular , in the neutron deficient part , these calculations reveal the key role played by the triaxial degree of freedom to reproduce the correct deformation of the ground state and first excited state bands in @xmath2kr .",
    "+ finally , the most microscopic approaches consistent with the underlying mean field are the work of bender _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( with the skyrme sly6 interaction ) and the calculation of @xmath18kr included in refs .",
    "@xcite ( with the pc - pk1 relativistic lagrangian ) .",
    "there , the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with particle number and angular momentum projected mean field states is applied . in both cases ,",
    "contrary to the 5dch results , these calculations do not reproduce the ordering of the low - lying levels , predicting oblate ground states also for @xmath2kr . since the 5dch is a gaussian overlap approximation of a gcm ,",
    "a lack of triaxiality in these exact gcm calculations has been proposed as the most plausible explanation for this problem . nevertheless , whether this contradiction is actually due to the inclusion of triaxial deformations or to the effective interaction , a study using the same underlying interaction and with the same beyond - mean - field approach , with and without including the triaxial degree of freedom , should be performed .",
    "this has been done recently in the nucleus @xmath18kr using the pc - pk1 relativistic lagrangian  @xcite but a more systematic study along the isotopic chain is still missing .",
    "+ in this work the shape evolution from neutron deficient to stable and neutron rich kr isotopes is studied in a unified manner , using the so - called symmetry conserving configuration mixing ( sccm ) method .",
    "this framework is based on the gcm and includes quantum number restorations ( particle number and angular momentum ) and shape mixing of axial and triaxial intrinsic states .",
    "in addition , gogny d1s  @xcite is used as the underlying interaction at every step .",
    "therefore , the triaxial degree of freedom is explored beyond mean field without using either ibm mappings or gaussian overlap approximations .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the most important aspects of the theoretical framework in sec .  [ theo ] are reviewed .",
    "then , in sec .  [ results ] , the results of the calculations , starting from a mean field description in terms of the energy surfaces and nilsson levels are shown .",
    "next , the shape evolution along the isotopic chain and the role played by the triaxial degree of freedom are discussed with the help of the collective wave functions . furthermore ,",
    "both global ( along the isotopic chain ) and individual ( nucleus by nucleus ) theoretical results are compared with the experimental data .",
    "finally , the most important conclusions of this work are summarized in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "as stated above , in this paper the so - called symmetry conserving configuration mixing ( sccm ) method is used .",
    "a detailed description of this theoretical framework can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , the most important aspects of this framework are now summarized , pointing out some differences with other similar methods used in the literature . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the energy at different levels of complexity of the many - body method are written as expectation values of a hamiltonian in the following paragraphs . however , since the gogny d1s interaction contains density dependencies , this notation is not fully rigorous and corresponding energy density functionals ( edf ) should be defined otherwise .",
    "furthermore , a proper definition of the edf is also key to avoid the potential problems that come out when symmetry restorations and configuration mixing are performed within this framework ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough description of this issue and refs .",
    "@xcite for the definition of the present edf ) .",
    "+ in the sccm method used in this work , the different many body states are calculated by mixing particle number and angular momentum restored intrinsic hartree - fock - bogoliubov type wave functions ( hfb ) which have different quadrupole shapes ( axial and non - axial )  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the total angular momentum and its projection on the @xmath23-axis in the laboratory and intrinsic frame respectively , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the angular momentum and neutron ( proton ) projectors defined through integrals in the euler and gauge angles respectively  @xcite and @xmath26 labels different states obtained for a given value of @xmath20 .",
    "the hfb - type states -@xmath27- are found with the variation after particle number projection method ( pn - vap )  @xcite i.e. , the particle number projected energy is minimized imposing constraints in the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are langrange multipliers that guarantee the conditions : @xmath31 in addition , the deformation parameters @xmath32 are directly related to @xmath33 by : @xmath34 being @xmath35 fm and @xmath36 the mass number . the pn - vap energy in eq .",
    "[ pn - vap ] defines a potential energy surface ( pes ) in the @xmath32 plane which is useful to analyze the intrinsic shape of the nucleus : @xmath37 the states in eq .",
    "[ gcm_state ] are the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) ansatz .",
    "hence , the parameters @xmath38 are variational parameters that are found by solving the hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) equations  @xcite : @xmath39 the energy and norm overlap matrices are defined as : @xmath40 normally the hwg equation ( one for each value of @xmath20 ) is solved by transforming the generalized eigenvalue problem defined by eq .  [ ritzgcm ] into a regular diagonalization problem  @xcite . to do so , the norm overlap matrix is first diagonalized : @xmath41 then , an orthonormal set of states , the so - called natural basis , is built with the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the norm overlap : @xmath42 in the last equation , the linear dependencies of the original set of states are removed by choosing those norm eigenvalues that are different from zero .",
    "therefore , both the gcm ansatz ( eq .  [ gcm_state ] ) and",
    "hwg equations ( eq .  [ ritzgcm ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath43 the solution of the hwg equations provide the coefficients @xmath44 , from which observables such as energy spectrum , radii , electromagnetic moments , reduced transition probabilities , etc . can be calculated .",
    "in addition , the weights of a given intrinsic @xmath32 configuration in the corresponding gcm state , the so - called collective wave functions , are also given as a function of the coefficients defined above : @xmath45 these quantities are useful to understand the intrinsic structure of the ground and excited states in terms of these collective coordinates .",
    "+ all of the above expressions can be largely simplified if the hfb - type states are axially symmetric  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 only takes two values , namely , @xmath47 ( prolate , @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( oblate , or , equivalently , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the angular momentum projection is then reduced to @xmath52 values and only one of the three integrals in the euler angles has to be evaluated . to check the relevance of the triaxial degree of freedom in the krypton isotopic chain , both axial and triaxial calculations with the same underlying interaction -gogny d1s-",
    "are discussed throughout this document .",
    "+        one should mention the methodological main differences between the present study and some recent calculations reported in the kr isotopic chain .",
    "as stated in the introduction , generator coordinate method with exact particle number and angular momentum projection calculations have been already performed with skyrme  @xcite and relativistic  @xcite energy density functionals but including only axial shapes @xmath53 which is a strong limitation to study shape transitions and coexistence in this region .",
    "only the nucleus @xmath18kr has been recently computed considering the triaxial degree of freedom with the relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in those cases , plain hfb or lipkin - nogami ( ln ) intrinsic wave functions are used instead of the ones provided by the pn - vap method .",
    "hence , pairing correlations are much better described than in the hfb and ln approaches that can not account for such correlations in weak pairing regimes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "five dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) results have been reported using the gogny d1s",
    "@xcite and covariant  @xcite interactions which include quadrupole triaxial shapes . however , the 5dch is deduced from the gcm method assuming a gaussian overlap approximation ( goa , see ref .",
    "quantum number projections are not taken into account in such a method either .",
    "this fact could affect significantly the spectrum predicted by 5dch calculations since the absence of particle number restoration leads to spurious mixing of solutions with different number of particles  @xcite .",
    "finally , recent calculations have been reported in this region within the interacting boson model ( ibm ) framework  @xcite . here",
    "the ibm hamiltonian of each isotope is mapped to the hfb potential energy surface in the @xmath32 plane calculated with the gogny d1 m interaction  @xcite .",
    "then , theoretical predictions are obtained after solving the ibm hamiltonian in a restricted valence space .",
    "+ consequently , in contrast to the methods reported above , the method used here includes the triaxial degree of freedom , quantum restoration and shape mixing correlations self - consistently and they are free from goa approaches",
    ". nevertheless , there are some limitations -shared also with the calculations already mentioned- that must be pointed out . + the most important limitations concern to hfb - type states , which do not contain explicit quasiparticle excitations , conserve both time - reversal and spatial parity symmetries and do not allow the inclusion of proton - neutron pairing .",
    "thus , neither negative parity states ( the lowest experimental @xmath54 state is found in @xmath7kr at 1.85 mev  @xcite ) nor pure single particle excitations can be obtained . nevertheless , parity - breaking calculations in this region with gogny interactions have shown in all of the nuclei studied here a static octupole deformation equal to zero  @xcite .",
    "therefore , its influence on the spectra should be eventually considered through octupole fluctuations and parity projection which are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "+ furthermore , excited states are not explored in a fully efficient way from the variational point of view due to the above restrictions .",
    "the inclusion of other degrees of freedom such as pairing  @xcite or quadrupole fluctuations  @xcite would improve the variational description of the excited states , particularly the @xmath5 states , but they are not considered here since they would increase prohibitively the computational time . finally ,",
    "since the hfb - type states have a product structure of protons and neutrons separately , @xmath55 pairing is not taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "this limitation can be particularly relevant in describing the @xmath56 nuclei but , again , an isospin mixing  @xcite performed in combination with the present sccm method is beyond the present study .",
    "nevertheless , the degrees of freedom relevant to describe qualitatively and , to some extent , also quantitatively the low - lying states in the kr isotopic chain are expected to be included in the present work .",
    "+ concerning some technical details about the calculations , a regular triangular mesh in the triaxial plane including @xmath57 hfb - type states are used .",
    "each of these states is expanded in a single particle basis with nine major spherical harmonic oscillator shells .",
    "the number of integration points in the euler -@xmath58- and gauge -@xmath59- angles are chosen to ensure the convergence of both diagonal and non - diagonal projected matrix elements of the total angular momentum and particle number operators to the nominal values @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively",

    "looking at the axial calculation for this nucleus , basically the same result as the triaxial one for the @xmath105 states is found but the @xmath5 states contain a smaller mixing and are inverted with respect to the triaxial calculation .",

    "proton - neutron pairing , potentially relevant around @xmath7kr , is not taking into account either .",
    "furthermore , the states that are almost pure quasiparticle excitations , like the ones expected at or near the shell closures , are out from the configuration space considered here .",
    "on the other hand , grouping the experimental states into bands can only be done in some nuclei , e.g. , @xmath145kr , while in other isotopes such an identification is not fully clear or the data is scarce  @xcite .",

    "peak at @xmath151- and the first excited band corresponds to a pseudo-@xmath46-band with a staggering that is not present in the experimental data .",

    "the situation is slightly different .",
    "they also have low - lying @xmath5 excited states and the oblate ground state bands are as well - defined as in @xmath14kr .",
    "however , the shape of the states of the first excited bands changes from oblate @xmath6 to prolate @xmath160 states through the @xmath70 states , that show triaxial / shape mixing . since there are some fingerprints of shape coexistence in the neighboring sr and zr nuclei  @xcite , more experimental data are of key importance to unveil the structural evolution of neutron rich nuclei around @xmath17 .",
