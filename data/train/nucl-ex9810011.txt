    "<S> the fragment separator frs at gsi was used as an energy - loss spectrometer to measure the longitudinal momentum distributions of @xmath0c fragments after one - neutron removal reactions in @xmath1c impinging on a carbon target at about 910  mev / u . </S>",

    "<S> the observed momentum distributions of @xmath6c fragments and neutrons from breakup reactions were reported to be very narrow and interpreted as evidence for a one - neutron halo structure in the @xmath7c ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this attracted much attention because before only one case of a one - neutron halo nucleus has been confirmed experimentally , namely @xmath8be @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus @xmath8be , where relative @xmath9-motion dominates the ground state , has been subject to extensive theoretical studies over the last few years @xcite and has provided a theoretical testing ground for one - neutron halo states .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , a nuclear halo state is characterized @xcite by a low separation energy and low angular momentum for the valence nucleon(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1c isotopes have small one - neutron separation energies compared to those of the corresponding core . as an example , @xmath10  kev  kev , based only on the two most recent measurements . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the core , @xmath11  kev . </S>",
    "<S> although the experimental determination of the @xmath7c mass is not very accurate , the neutron separation energy appears to be even smaller than the one for @xmath8be ( @xmath12  kev @xcite ) , which is a strong motivation for investigating the nuclear structure of @xmath7c .    in the present study , </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out measurements of the longitudinal momentum distribution of @xmath0c fragments after breakup of @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi delivered an @xmath13ar primary beam at 1  gev / u with an intensity of about @xmath14 particles per spill . </S>",
    "<S> for the production of the secondary beam , a @xmath15be target of 6.33  g/@xmath16 thickness was placed at the entrance of the magnetic spectrometer frs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] shows the experimental arrangement at the frs , which was operated as an energy - loss spectrometer . in this ion - optical mode </S>",
    "<S> , the momentum distribution after reactions in the breakup target can be measured independently of the relatively large momentum spread of the incident secondary beam . </S>",
    "<S> the breakup target , 4.45  g/@xmath17 carbon , was situated at the central focal plane ( f2 ) , where the dispersion was 7.1  m. the final focus ( f4 ) was achromatic with respect to the production target , but had a dispersion of 5.9  m with respect to the breakup target .    for a complete tracking of the incident particles and the breakup fragments at the central focal plane , three gas - filled time projection chambers ( tpc1tpc3 ) were employed , one placed in front of the breakup target and two placed behind it . </S>",
    "<S> the tpc is a two - dimensional position sensitive detector with a homogeneous matter distribution and a resolution better than 0.5  mm in @xmath18- and @xmath19-coordinates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal momentum induced at the breakup target was determined from the positions in tpc4 and tpc5 at the final focal plane .    for the measurements of the breakup reactions , the magnetic fields of the first two dipole stages of the frs , including quadrupole and hexapole magnets , </S>",
    "<S> were set to select the beams of @xmath20c or @xmath7c . </S>",
    "<S> a scintillation detector ( sci1 ) in front of the breakup target was used to identify the proton number @xmath21 of the incoming particles . </S>",
    "<S> the magnets behind the breakup target were set to a magnetic rigidity ( @xmath22 ) corresponding to fragments arising from a one - neutron removal of the selected projectile . </S>",
    "<S> particles arriving at the final focus ( f4 ) were identified by measuring the time - of - flight between the scintillators sci1 and sci2 , by determining the magnetic rigidity from the position measurement , and by a coincident energy - deposition measurement in an ionisation chamber ( ic1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the different isotopes were well separated in an @xmath23 versus @xmath21 plot . </S>",
    "<S> the unambiguous identification at f4 , the @xmath21-identification in front of the breakup target , and the individual @xmath22-settings ensured that only reaction products from a one - neutron removal contributed to the measured momentum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22-measurement was calibrated using the primary beam at different energies . </S>",
    "<S> the achromatism and the dispersions of the ion - optical system were experimentally deduced by transmitting the @xmath20c and the @xmath7c beam to the final focal plane ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distribution of the core fragments is directly deduced from the position measurements with tpc4 and tpc5 using the experimentally determined dispersion at the final focus . </S>",
    "<S> ion - optical aberrations , atomic energy straggling , and angular straggling in the relatively thick breakup target limit the resolution that can be achieved in this measurement . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions , which broaden the measured widths by about 3% , were quantified by measuring the position distributions of @xmath20c and @xmath7c nuclei that penetrated the breakup target without nuclear reactions . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the measured position distribution of @xmath7c at f4 is presented together with the corresponding distribution of the @xmath6c fragments .    the breakup of the projectile nuclei is statistically distributed along their path inside the target . </S>",
    "<S> this causes an additional energy straggling due to the difference in energy loss between the nuclei before and after one - neutron removal . for this , we computed a negligible contribution for the momentum of @xmath24 by applying the ion - optical ray tracing code mocadi @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal momentum distribution of @xmath4c fragments from the breakup of @xmath20c is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this momentum distribution , which is transformed into the @xmath20c projectile frame , exhibits neither a pure lorentzian nor a gaussian distribution . using a combination of two gaussian distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we could reproduce the shape and determined a fwhm of @xmath25  mev/@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> after correction for the experimental resolution mentioned above , this gives a fwhm of @xmath2  mev/@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this value agrees very well with a recent experiment at 84  mev / u beam energy , where a fwhm of @xmath26  mev/@xmath3 was obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there also exists a published result from an earlier measurement of @xmath20c at low energies @xcite , but this value suffers from a poor identification as stated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and should not be used for this comparison .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] presents the momentum distribution of @xmath6c , transformed into the @xmath7c projectile frame . in order to cover a larger range of momenta , </S>",
    "<S> this distribution was recorded at two different @xmath22-settings for the magnetic stages behind the breakup target . </S>",
    "<S> the two spectra that form the combined distribution were normalized using the total particle count rate at f2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the momentum distribution of @xmath6c fragments is well reproduced by a lorentzian between @xmath27  mev/@xmath3 and @xmath28  mev/@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm of this distribution is @xmath29  mev/@xmath3 , yielding @xmath5  mev/@xmath3 with the experimental resolution taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this width is about 3 times smaller than the one obtained from the statistical model of goldhaber @xcite with the refined parameterization of morrissey @xcite , which in general gives a good description of experimental results for tightly bound nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured width for the @xmath7c breakup agrees with the neutron momentum width of @xmath30  mev/@xmath3 ( fwhm ) obtained in an experiment at 30  mev / u @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is significantly larger than the result of the investigation of @xmath7c at an energy of 77  mev / u , where a fwhm of @xmath31  mev/@xmath3 ( c.m .  </S>",
    "<S> frame ) was reported . </S>",
    "<S> this value is based on the first measurement of the nuclear breakup of @xmath7c ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , but the data have been revised in a later publication @xcite , to which we refer here .    the main differences between refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and our measurement are the projectile energies ( 77  mev / u and 914  mev / u ) and the target materials ( beryllium and carbon ) . in earlier measurements of longitudinal momentum distributions for the halo nuclei @xmath8be and @xmath8li , no significant dependence of the width on beam energy or target material has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of a limited spectrometer acceptance were taken into account for the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the case of our measurement , these effects are negligible due to the forward focussing at relativistic beam energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this was carefully checked in our analysis using the complete particle tracking at the breakup target and at the final focal plane . from the agreement of the results for @xmath20c between ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and our measurement , we conclude that systematic experimental effects can be ruled out as a cause of the difference observed for @xmath7c . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep in mind , however , that the statistics of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath7c are very low </S>",
    "<S> . a measurement at low energies with comparable statistics would be desirable in order to confirm or disprove this difference . </S>",
    "<S> we note for later use that the presently measured width for @xmath7c is considerably larger than the 4350  mev/@xmath3 @xcite found for @xmath8be in spite of the one - neutron separation energy being a factor of about two lower in the case of @xmath7c .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not the aim of the present paper to provide a new attempt for a theoretical description of the structure of @xmath1c since there are several recent works that have dealt with this problem . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we shall give a brief outline of the present status and comment on what we can conclude at this stage with respect to our experimental findings .    a common feature of @xmath1c </S>",
    "<S> is a loosely bound neutron moving outside a core which itself is already far off stability . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of low - lying @xmath32 states in @xmath0c at 1.77 and 1.62  mev @xcite , respectively , indicates that core polarization may play an important role in these nuclides . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state wave function of @xmath1c can then be expected to have @xmath33 and @xmath34 neutrons coupled to the @xmath35 ground state and the @xmath36 state as the dominating configurations . to illustrate the contributions to the experimental widths from the different components of the wave function , we show in fig .  [ fig5 ] a calculation of the momentum widths after breakup of @xmath7c for pure @xmath9- and @xmath37-orbits as a function of the neutron separation energy . in this calculation , we used hankel radial wave functions , which are the exact solutions of the schrdinger equation outside the range of the potential , and introduced a lower cylindrical cutoff when transforming it to the corresponding momentum coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> this cutoff , estimated as the sum of the core and target radii @xcite , ensures that the one - neutron removal process takes place in the outer region of the wave function , keeping the core intact . </S>",
    "<S> the measured longitudinal momentum distribution of the @xmath6c fragment favors the @xmath38 or @xmath39 scenario where the main part of the wave function ( @xmath40% ) contains relative @xmath9-motion between the halo neutron and the @xmath41 excited state of @xmath6c . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data for one - neutron removal from @xmath20c can be reproduced by an almost pure @xmath37-wave neutron ( @xmath42  mev ) orbiting around the @xmath35 ground state of @xmath4c . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the first excited @xmath36 state at 1.77  mev of @xmath4c further improves the agreement with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> bazin _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ also used hankel wave functions to fit their data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they used shell model calculations to determine the parentage of the ground state to single particle wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the best agreement with the experimental data for @xmath20c was found when a spin parity of @xmath43 from @xmath9- and @xmath37-wave neutrons coupled to the @xmath36 state in @xmath4c was assumed . in the @xmath7c case , they used the wbt interaction predicting the spin parity of the ground state to be @xmath44 with the dominating configuration @xmath45 . with these assumptions </S>",
    "<S> , they claimed to get a good fit to the width , while from our calculation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ) we would expect a value closer to 60 mev/@xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> ridikas _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite investigated @xmath1c in a neutron - plus - core coupling model with a deformed wood - saxon potential for the neutron  core interaction . </S>",
    "<S> their analysis excluded a @xmath46 for @xmath20c , while in the @xmath7c case , they concluded that the main contribution to the ground state comes from relative @xmath9-motion between the halo neutron and the core , with the @xmath6c core either in its ground state or the @xmath36 state . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were compared to the experimental fwhm of @xmath47  mev/@xmath3 @xcite , but there were difficulties to reproduce such a narrow width @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a better agreement with the value given in this paper is obtained if @xmath48 is assumed , and if the wave function has an appreciable amount of @xmath9-motion coupled to the @xmath32 state of @xmath6c .    describing the coupling of single particle configurations to excitations of the core nucleus by dynamical core polarization ( dcp ) leads to a more detailed approach . as outlined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and discussed for stable nuclei in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the core  </S>",
    "<S> particle interactions are obtained microscopically from rpa calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to non - static and non - local self - energies thus extending the nuclear mean - field description beyond the static hartree - fock approach . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical core polarization is well understood for stable nuclei , where it is found to describe rather accurately single particle strength distributions of odd mass nuclei as , e.g. , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the dcp approach , a @xmath49 ground state for @xmath20c </S>",
    "<S> is found which , however , is almost degenerate with a nearby @xmath44 state at @xmath50  kev . for @xmath7c , </S>",
    "<S> the calculations predict a @xmath49 ground state obtained at a separation energy @xmath51  </S>",
    "<S> kev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first @xmath44 state is found about 300  kev above the ground state , and is located just beyond the continuum threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath52 leading particle configuration accounts for only 40% of the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath53 core excited configuration accounts for the major part of the @xmath7c ground state . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the binding of @xmath7c is probably dominated by dynamical particle  core interactions rather than static mean - field dynamics . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , shell structures are dissolved and the last neutron is distributed over the single particle orbitals in the ( @xmath54)-valence shell coupled to core excited configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the proximity of the @xmath9- and @xmath37-states makes it difficult to predict the ground state configurations based only on measured momentum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the half - life predictions for @xmath7c are not sensitive to the ground state spin @xcite , and such experimental information is therefore non - conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> the various theoretical approaches  although being very different in detail  lead to the common conclusion that the first excited @xmath36 state of the core plays an important role in both @xmath20c and @xmath7c . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the spatial extension of the halo neutron would be less than indicated by the ground state separation energy alone . </S>",
    "<S> the above comparison of the widths obtained for @xmath7c and @xmath8be indeed shows that the @xmath7c ground state is a less developed one - neutron halo state .    for future experimental work , </S>",
    "<S> one of the challenges will be a determination of the contribution from the first excited core state , either by the observation of @xmath55 rays in coincidence with the charged fragments , or by high - resolution mass spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> another task is to verify the experimental indication of an energy dependence of the widths , and , if this trend remains , to give a theoretical description of it . </S>"
