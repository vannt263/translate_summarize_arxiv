    "accordingly , there is a notable difference in the shape of the elasticity region in the @xmath61 plane : in the first case , the collisions may be elastic only if the velocities are small , while in the other cases , the solitons with large but nearly opposite velocities , @xmath62 , collide elastically even if the velocities are large .    as it was stressed above , in the case of finite frustration ,",
    "the velocity interval corresponding to the stable solitons may be limited not only from above , but also from below .",

    "as it was mentioned above , in the currently feasible experiments with bg solitons , their velocity can not be made smaller than , approximately , half the maximum group velocity , which is @xmath63 in the present notation .",
    "for this reason , it is quite important that the elasticity regions shown in figs .",
    "[ cc](b , c ) and [ cc2](a , b ) extend to large values of @xmath47 .",
    "lastly , it is necessary to mention that , as well as the stability of individual solitons , the outcome of the collisions is not sensitive to the relative bg reflectivity @xmath10 , on the contrary to the strong dependence on the frustration @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , the elasticity regions show almost no dependence on @xmath10 , therefore the examples shown in figs . [ cc ] and [ cc2 ]",
    "are quite generic ones .",
    "in this paper , we have presented results of a systematic study of the stability and collisions of moving four - wave solitons in the recently introduced model of the bragg cross - grating in planar optical waveguides with the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "we have focused on the case when the system s linear spectrum does not contain any true bandgap , but rather features semi - gaps , in which soliton families may be found . in recent works ,",
    "only zero - velocity solitons in this four - wave system have been studied .",
    "that case is far from the current experiments , which generate solitons whose velocity exceed , roughly , half the maximum group velocity .",
    "we have found the semi - gaps for the moving solitons in the analytical form , and demonstrated that numerically found solitons completely fill the semi - gaps .",
    "stability of the moving solitons was determined by direct simulations , revealing a stability border which strongly depends on the frustration parameter .",
    "it is interesting that a previously unknown situation is possible in the present model , when the velocity interval for stable solitons is limited not only from above , but also from below .    collisions between stable solitons may be both elastic , so that they bounce from each other , and strongly inelastic , leading to a partial destruction of the solitons , with a sharp border between the two outcomes .",
    "a region of elastic collisions was identified , with a well - pronounced peculiarity : if the individual solitons are close to the stability border , they collide elastically only if their velocities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small ; however , if the solitons are more stable , the collision remains elastic in a strip around the line @xmath2 . as well as",
