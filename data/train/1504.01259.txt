    "the fractionalization of electrons in solids is one of the central topics in modern condensed matter physics .",
    "a prototypical example is found in one - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems : charge and spin degrees of freedom in an electron behave as independent particles , which are termed holon and spinon , respectively  @xcite . a different form of fractionalization is also anticipated in insulating magnets with geometrical frustration . for instance , the existence of the elementary excitation carrying a half of spin , named spinon , is predicted in a quantum spin liquid ( qsl )  @xcite , and emergence of magnetic monopoles is suggested in spin ice systems  @xcite .",
    "another fractionalization was pointed out in heavy fermion systems as well .",
    "the half residual entropy in the two - channel impurity kondo system is understood from the fractionalization of @xmath1 impurity spin into two majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "a quantum spin model , called the kitaev model , has recently attracted considerable attention in broad areas of research , not only condensed matter physics but also statistical physics and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "this model is composed of @xmath1 spins with bond - dependent interactions on a honeycomb lattice .",
    "such peculiar interactions were suggested to be realized in the systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , such as iridium oxides  @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of this model is that it is exactly solvable due to the existence of @xmath2 conserved quantity on each hexagon , termed flux .",
    "the ground state dictates both gapless and gapped qsl phases depending on the exchange coupling constants .",
    "the exact solution is provided by representing @xmath1 spins by two types of majorana fermions : one is localized and composes the fluxes , and the other forms itinerant bands  @xcite .",
    "the latter itinerant majorana fermions determine the excitation spectrum in the qsls .",
    "thus , the fractionalization of spins into majorana fermions is not just a mathematical tool but physically important in the kitaev model .",
    "a natural question arising here is how high - temperature ( @xmath0 ) paramagnetic spins are fractionalized into majorana fermions when cooling the system .",
    "considering the fact that the spin - charge separation in the one - dimensional electron systems plays a key role in comparison with experiments , it is crucial to elucidate the thermal fractionalization for experimental exploration of the qsl physics .",
    "the thermodynamic properties in the kitaev model and its extensions have been studied , mainly for explaining the magnetism in iridium oxides  @xcite , but the signature of fractionalization at finite @xmath0 was not addressed in most of the previous studies . among them , however , the authors pointed out the significance of fractionalization in a peculiar phase transition at finite @xmath0 in a three - dimensional extension of the kitaev model  @xcite : the phase transition is governed by thermal excitations of localized majorana fermions .",
    "nevertheless , the relevance of fractionalization remains unclear , in particular , to the experimentally - observable quantities .    in this paper , we investigate the effect of fractionalization of quantum spins on the finite-@xmath0 properties of the kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice by applying the unbiased quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method . in this model ,",
    "the two majorana fermions , itinerant and localized , release their entropy successively at two well - separated @xmath0 scales .",
    "we elucidate that each crossover has an impact on experimental observables : the high-@xmath0 one , driven by itinerant majorana fermions , corresponds to the development of spin correlations between neighboring sites , while the low-@xmath0 one , originating from thermal fluctuations of localized majorana fermions , is accompanied by a sizable change in the excitation spectrum of itinerant majorana fermions .",
    "this leads to apparent @xmath0-linear behavior of the specific heat and coherent transport of majorana fermions in the intermediate-@xmath0 state between the two crossovers , in contrast to the dirac semimetallic behavior and @xmath3 specific heat anticipated in the low-@xmath0 limit .",
