    "despite its long history , photodisintegration of the deuteron is still a very intensely studied process . in the past decades",
    ", large efforts were made in order to understand this simplest photonuclear reaction . at energies below @xmath0-threshold , where the theory is based on realistic @xmath3-interaction models and corresponding exchange currents ,",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is quite satisfactory . on the contrary , in the @xmath4-resonance region where the @xmath4-excitation is dominant",
    ", the situation is much less well settled ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "none of the models developed so far such as the diagrammatic approach of laget @xcite , the framework of nuclear isobar configurations in the impulse approximation @xcite , the unitary three - body model @xcite and the coupled channel approach ( cc ) is able to describe in a satisfactory manner the experimental data over the whole @xmath4-resonance region . in the impulse approximation @xcite and also in the cc approach of @xcite",
    ", several parameters were adjusted in order to fit the total cross section whereas in the three - body model of @xcite and in the coupled channel approach of @xcite all free parameters were fixed in advance by fitting @xmath3- and @xmath5-scattering , and @xmath0-photoproduction on the nucleon . consequently , no adjustable parameters remained for deuteron photodisintegration .",
    "however , it turned out that both approaches considerably underestimated the total cross section in the @xmath4-region by about 20 - 30% .",
    "another failure was the wrong shape of the differential cross section which was flatter than the experimental one and which developed a more and more pronounced dip around @xmath6 with increasing energy .",
    "also the photon asymmetry was not well described , especially at photon energies above 300 mev .",
    "one of the crucial points in these calculations is the question of how to fix the @xmath7-coupling @xmath8 in the @xmath9-current    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the energy available for the internal excitation of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 the momentum of the incoming photon . while in the impulse approximation and also in @xcite",
    "the whole @xmath13-strength was interpreted as @xmath4-excitation strength , the more sophisticated approaches have determined @xmath14 by fitting the @xmath15-multipole of pion photoproduction on the nucleon including nonresonant born terms , resulting in a smaller @xmath14 and consequently a smaller photodisintegration cross section .",
    "the born terms contributing to the @xmath16-channel are the crossed @xmath17-pole and @xmath0-pole graphs .",
    "when embedded into the two - nucleon system , these born terms become part of the recoil and the @xmath0-meson current , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ vergleich ] ) . in static calculations , however , the recoil current is not present due to its cancellation against the wave function renormalization current @xcite . a similar , but",
    "less serious problem arises in the treatment of the pion pole diagrams compared to the meson current of static mec .",
    "it had already been conjectured in @xcite that this inconsistent treatment of pion exchange may lead to the observed underestimation of the total cross section in their coupled channel approach , because by incorporating the born terms effectively into an increased @xmath18-excitation strength a satisfactory agreement with the data could be achieved .    in the present paper",
    ", we have overcome these shortcomings by including for the first time in a coupled channel approach complete retardation in the @xmath0-exchange contributions to potentials and mecs .",
    "this retardation is not approximated by keeping only the leading order contribution of a @xmath19-expansion in the @xmath20-propagators as was done for example in .",
    "we furthermore consider the intermediate @xmath2-channel in order to ensure all unitarity constraints up to the @xmath21-threshold .",
    "in our framework , the hilbert space is subdivided into three orthogonal spaces @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 consists of two nucleons only , in @xmath24 one of the nucleons is replaced by a @xmath4(1232)-isobar , and @xmath25 contains at least one meson besides two baryons .",
    "@xmath25 is then eliminated by introducing effective operators in @xmath26 using the projection operator technique .    for photodisintegration",
    "we need the outgoing @xmath3-scattering wave with total energy @xmath27 which can be expressed as @xmath28 { \\mbox{$|nn\\rangle$}}\\,\\ , , \\quad z= e - i \\epsilon \\,\\ , .",

    "( [ t - matrix1 ] ) and ( [ t - matrix2 ] ) consist of two terms ( fig .",
    "[ hadint ] ) @xmath37 incorporating respectively the usual boson - exchange mechanism and the formation of an interacting @xmath3-pair with deuteron quantum numbers and a pion as a spectator ( denoted for simplicity by @xmath2 ) . in static applications",
    ", we have chosen for @xmath38 the realistic , energy independent bonn - obepr model @xcite , whereas for the inclusion of full @xmath0-retardation we have used an improved version of the energy dependent bonn - obept model developed by elster et al .",
    "@xcite which contains besides retarded operators also self energy diagrams calculated within a simple lee model @xcite .    for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we have constructed corresponding static and retarded @xmath0- and @xmath41-exchange potentials , taking for the @xmath20- and @xmath42-form factors the ones of the full bonn potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43- and @xmath44-regulator masses are fixed by fitting the @xmath45 @xmath3-partial wave which is of crucial importance for deuteron photodisintegration because of its strong coupling to the dominant @xmath46 partial wave .",
    "the diagonal interaction @xmath47 in @xmath24 consists of the forward and backward going pion diagrams as depicted in fig .",
    "[ hadint ] . for its @xmath42-vertex ,",
    "the form factor of @xcite is used .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of @xmath48 , which was studied in @xcite but not included in @xcite . from the corresponding diagram of fig .",
    "[ hadint ] it is obvious that @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the nonrelativistic @xmath51- or @xmath52-vertex , respectively .",
    "the free @xmath20-propagator @xmath53 is taken in the static limit and @xmath54 denotes the @xmath3-scattering amplitude in @xmath55-space describing an intermediate off - shell @xmath3-state with the quantum numbers of the deuteron and a pion as spectator .",
    "the amplitude @xmath54 is obtained from the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the free @xmath2-propagator .",
    "it can be solved easily by assuming a separable form for the driving term @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a free @xmath2-state with relative momentum @xmath61 .",
    "this ansatz for @xmath58 satisfies for any realistic @xmath3-potential @xmath62 the schrdinger equation for the @xmath2-state @xmath63    since the parameters of the realistic @xmath62 are fitted to deuteron properties and @xmath3-scattering phases without explicit coupling to the @xmath1- and @xmath2-channels , we have to apply a box - renormalization @xcite @xmath64 in order to ensure an approximate phase equivalence in the presence of these additional channels .",
    "now we turn to the e.m .",
    "part of our model . above @xmath0-threshold ,",
    "the @xmath4-excitation is the most important photoabsorption mechanism , which is described by the current operator in eq .",
    "( [ ndcurrent ] ) neglecting small e2 contributions . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath8 is an energy dependent and complex coupling which is fitted to the experimental @xmath65-multipole of pion photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "it contains besides the bare @xmath7-coupling contributions from nonresonant pion rescattering .",
    "the full pion photoproduction amplitude @xmath66 in the @xmath16-channel can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the nonresonant born amplitude . while in @xcite an effective @xmath69-coupling @xmath70 and the model of @xcite for the bare @xmath4-mass @xmath33 , the @xmath4-self energy @xmath34 and",
    "the @xmath71-vertex @xmath72 has been used , we follow here the work of tanabe and ohta ( model a in @xcite ) in which an explicit evaluation of the half - off - shell born amplitude in the @xmath15-multipole has been performed .",
    "furthermore , concomitant with the construction of the effective interactions , we have derived the corresponding effective two - body charge and current density operators which fulfil current conservation ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "these @xmath0-retarded mecs contain besides the usual vertex- , meson- and contact - mecs the recoil current and charge densities and a couple of additional two - body operators which vanish identically in the static limit .",
    "whereas the latter ones yield only very small contributions which can be safely neglected , the recoil contributions turn out to be quite important ( see discussion below ) .",
    "they do not appear in static approaches due to their cancellation against the wave function renormalization contributions @xcite , which have their origin in the renormalization of the baryonic states when eliminating the mesonic wave function components .",
    "this concept breaks down beyond the @xmath0-threshold if full @xmath0-retardation is considered since the @xmath73-component can be on - shell .",
    "therefore , we do not orthonormalize and no wave function renormalization contributions appear . consequently , the recoil current and charge densities have to be included .",
    "besides the @xmath0-mecs and the corresponding siegert operators , our model includes the usual nucleonic one - body current and as most important relativistic contribution ( besides retardation ) the spin - orbit current . because the @xmath41-mass is rather large , retardation in the @xmath41-mec is expected to be rather unimportant and",
    "therefore not considered in this work . concerning the @xmath74-@xmath0-mec",
    ", we include retardation in the corresponding recoil part , whereas , due to their minor importance , the contact- , meson- and vertex - contributions are taken in the static limit . since the pion production model of tanabe and",
    "ohta @xcite effectively incorporates @xmath75-exchange , we include in addition the leading order @xmath76- and @xmath77-currents , which are purely transverse @xcite .",
    "in the numerical evaluation we have included all multipoles and scattering waves up to @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "retardation in the meson- , vertex- , contact- and @xmath80-currents is only included up to @xmath81 .",
    "for the higher multipoles the static limit has been adopted , because inclusion of retardation effects there does not show significant effects on observables .",
    "we start the discussion of deuteron photodisintegration with the total cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ sigtot ] .",
    "similar to , the static calculation ( without @xmath2-channel and @xmath82-mecs ) considerably underestimates the data ( dotted curve ) . however , the @xmath7-coupling of @xcite used in our approach is somewhat larger than the one used by wilhelm et al .",
    ", so that the discrepancy between our static calculation and experiment is not as dramatic as in .",
    "the reduction of the cross section by the inclusion of retardation in the hadronic interaction ( dash - dotted curve ) is , however , overcompensated if retardation in the @xmath0-mecs is added , of which the recoil contributions turn out to be the most important ones . this destructive interference of retardation in potential and recoil current corresponds to the cancellation of wave function renormalization and recoil current in the static limit .",
    "however , here remains a net effect leading to a significant increase .",
    "the cross section is further enhanced by inclusion of the @xmath2-channel and the @xmath80-mecs ( by about 8% respectively 3% at 260 mev ) so that the complete calculation ( full curve ) agrees quite well with the experimental data over the whole energy range .",
    "concerning the role of the @xmath2-channel in @xmath3-scattering , its influence on the inelasticity of the @xmath45-channel is similar to @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to our result of a slight enhancement , the @xmath2-channel leads in @xcite to a reduction of the cross section in @xmath83 , the reason for which we are presently investigating .    in figs .",
    "[ wqdiff ] and [ sigma ] , we show differential cross sections and photon asymmetries for various energies .",
    "whereas now the differential cross section is in satisfactory agreement with the data , we slightly underestimate the absolute size of the asymmetry .",
    "in contrast to we are able to reproduce quite well the shape of these two observables also at higher energies , in particular the dips in the angular distributions have disappeared .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated that a cc approach including @xmath74- and @xmath2-channels with full pion retardation in potentials and exchange currents is able to remove almost quantitatively the still existing discrepancies between theory and experiment in deuteron photodisintegration in the @xmath4-region .",
    "further improvements of our model should include relativistic contributions to internal dynamics and currents whereas boost effects are expected to be small @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a realistic @xmath3-interaction is desirable which includes isobar degrees of freedom in a coupled channel approach from the beginning so that no box renormalization procedure is necessary .",
    "the success of our model in @xmath84 encourages us to study retardation in related e.m .",
    "processes on the deuteron in the near future , like @xmath0-photoproduction and electrodisintegration .",
