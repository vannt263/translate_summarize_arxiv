    "ferroelectrics and the closely related high dielectric constant materials are important in many areas of modern technology including memory , sensor and electronic applications , and are of fundamental scientific interest @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectric phase change belongs to a class of structural transitions , generally termed _ ferrodistortive _ , triggered by zone - center soft modes of lattice motion .",
    "characteristically the ferroelectric transition involves the condensation of an optically active lattice mode which causes the appearance of long - range polar order and the breaking of the inversion symmetry of the ` high - temperature ' prototype lattice .",
    "one important issue is the ferroelectric quantum critical point , _ i.e. _ the physics occurring when , by varying a control parameter @xmath4 ( applied pressure or change of chemical composition ) , the transition temperature of a ferroelectric is driven to zero . although a quantum critical point occurs at @xmath5 , the fluctuations associated with the critical point may control behavior over a range of temperature and pressure .",
    "for example k. a. mller @xcite coined the term `` quantum paraelectric '' to describe materials in which ferroelectric ordering is prevented by quantal fluctuations .",
    "a material just on the disordered side of the @xmath5 ferro - paraelectric transition is therefore an example of a `` quantum paraelectric '' .",
    "the important feature of quantal ( @xmath5 ) phase transitions is that temporal fluctuations must be treated on the same footing as thermal ones @xcite .",
    "this raises the effective dimensionality and makes the critical behavior more mean - field - like but with temperature dependence controlled by ` dangerous irrelevant operators ' @xcite .",
    "ferroelectric transitions may be described by bosonic field theories with undamped dynamics ( if the effect of free carriers may be neglected ) and complicated dispersions arising from the long range of the dipolar interaction .",
    "quantum critical phenomena associated with undamped bosonic field theories with short ranged interactions have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the effect of long range ( dipole ) forces was studied by rechester @xcite and by khmelnitskii and shneerson @xcite within an approximation equivalent to the self - consistent one loop approximation of moriya @xcite .",
    "aharony and fisher @xcite studied the classical ferroelectric transition and found that anisotropies associated with the dipolar interaction led to a new universality class . in this paper",
    "we reexamine the issue in light of recent developments in the theory of quantum critical phenomena .",
    "we formulate a realistic action for the ferroelectric soft modes , show how estimates of the parameters may be obtained from ab initio calculations and study quantitatively the consequences of the dipolar - induced anisotropies .",
    "our results agree in essentials with those of rechester and khmelnitskii and shneerson , but we obtain a more detailed and quantitative picture of the phase boundary , of the effect of anisotropy , and of the logarithmic corrections arising at the marginal dimensionality , which lead to an evolution of the anisotropy as the ordered phase is approached .",
