    "the starting up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) operating in an energy range far above the electroweak scale , offers a possibility to reveal new phenomena and to explore the phenomenology extracted from the expected huge amount of experimental data . in this way",
    ", it is expected new physics manifestations throughout the appearance of new degrees of freedom such as new charged and neutral fermions , superpartners , new gauge bosons , and higgs scalar(s ) . to take into account these new possible degrees of freedom",
    "we must go beyond the sm .",
    "there are many ways to construct extensions of the electroweak sm .",
    "however , if we are concerned with new gauge bosons we must consider a larger gauge group .",
    "whatever the extension of the sm is , it must present the same results of the sm at the electroweak energy scale in order to be consistent with present data .",
    "although hadron colliders present a high background ( pile - up ) compared to electron - positron ( beamstrahlung ) colliders , they seem to be more suitable for discovering new degrees of freedom . since high centre - of - mass energy and high precision",
    "can not be achieved simultaneously in the same experiment , both types of colliders are needed in order to have a detailed description of a particular phenomena .",
    "this is easily realized if we look to a recent past , when the synergy between hadron and lepton colliders , brought up complementary information for each other , generating benefits to high energy physics . as examples we have the discovery of the @xmath9 boson , the gluon , and the quark top .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath9 boson occurred in a @xmath10 collider ( sps ) but its properties ( decay widths , couplings to fermions , asymmetries , mass , etc ... ) were measured with high precision in lepton colliders ( slc , lep ) . in this way , the recent studies started at lhc can direct the search for new physics in future linear colliders ( ilc / clic ) .    among the main goals of any accelerator proposal we find the physics of an extra neutral gauge boson @xmath11 .",
    "this new boson is predicted by many extensions of the standard model like :    * the models from @xmath12 group , also know as rank 5 models ( er5 m ) @xcite ; * the left - right which are based in the group @xmath13 @xcite ; * the models with @xmath11 in little higgs scenario @xcite ; * the sequential standard models - ssm @xcite ; * the kaluza klein ( kk ) models , predicted by extra dimensions @xcite ; * the models with @xmath14 gauge symmetry , known as 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite ; * models where a strong dynamics is involved in the electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we can cite , for instance , topcolor and bess ( breaking electroweak symmetry strongly ) models @xcite .",
    "some models which have an extra @xmath15 gauge group  @xcite also deserve a detailed study in order to predict new physics behavior .",
    "the cumulative study of different models , candidates to describe the electroweak interaction , can guide the lhc data analysis if in fact a @xmath11 is discovered .",
    "the extra @xmath15 group gives rise to the @xmath11 vector boson .",
    "the new constraints on these models generate few free parameters , if we compare them to other models which have origin in larger gauge groups . following the arguments here exposed ,",
    "first we have considered the @xmath11 boson observables for electron - positron colliders @xcite , and now we extend the study for hadron colliders .    in this paper , we study the phenomenology of the @xmath16 boson originated from two different extensions of the electroweak sm with an extra @xmath15 gauge factor .",
    "we predict the possible signals of new physics in the process @xmath17 , at the tree level .",
    "we compare several quantities as total cross sections , number of events , and decay widths assuming that both @xmath15 factors correspond to the local @xmath2 symmetry , and that the breaking of this symmetry occurs at an energy scale above the tev scale .    in order to have a more realistic scenario",
    ", we choose the parameters and constraints of the two different models to compare them at the same @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "we use @xmath18 gev , but we also show the results for @xmath19 gev , for two centre - of - mass energies : @xmath20 and @xmath21 tev .    this article is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we introduce the models . in section",
    "iii we present the results and in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we consider two extensions of the electroweak sm which have an extra @xmath15 local factor , resulting in the total gauge symmetry @xmath22 .",
    "more specifically , we are concerned with models which are based on the gauge symmetries :    * @xmath23 , called as secluded model  @xcite ; * @xmath24 called as flipped model  @xcite .    in the secluded model",
    ", @xmath25 is a new @xmath15 charge , and @xmath26 is the electroweak sm hypercharge . in the flipped one",
    ", @xmath27 is a new extra @xmath15 charge , and the @xmath2 charge assignments are those of the sm . in this last model the sm hypercharge is recovered after the first spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in the secluded model , the electric charge has no component in the @xmath28 and in particular , depending on the value of this charge , several versions of this model can be studied .",
    "our analysis will be focused on comparing both models only when the @xmath25 charge of the secluded model coincides with @xmath2 . besides ,",
    "in this minimal version , considered here , both models have the same scalar sector , composed by one doublet , @xmath29 , with hypercharge @xmath30 , and a complex singlet with @xmath31 .",
    "the number of right - handed neutrinos is three , in order to be consistent with the anomaly cancellations .",
    "we had set them to be heavy enough in order to have @xmath11 decay into heavy right - handed neutrinos kinematically suppressed .",
    "besides that , the minimal version considered here is also absent of exotic decay channels like heavy quarks or heavy charged leptons .",
    "so , our results of decay widths , branchings fractions for these two particular @xmath11 models are related only to standard model fermions .",
    "we will parameterize the neutral currents in terms of the mass eigenstate fields as follows : @xmath32\\psi_i .",

    ", there is no tree level mixing in the mass matrix between the neutral gauge bosons @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , i.e. the mass eigenstates and the symmetry eigenstates coincide .",
    "this is not the case for the flipped model . here",
    ", we will assume that the mixing between the two neutral vector bosons is small enough so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "both models are well motivated since , in general , they can be thought as an intermediate symmetry , remnant of a larger ( unknown ) gauge symmetry , that was broken at a very large energy scale .",
    "moreover , they are simpler compared to other class of models with an extra @xmath0 neutral vector boson : simpler gauge groups and fewer free parameters .",
    "we have first chosen @xmath18 gev in order to compare the results coming from the two different models . for the secluded model ,",

    "the flipped model has not received the same level of attention .",
    "we find that it also deserves a detailed study to establish constraints on its parameters and numerical couplings .    for the flipped model we use the following inputs : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 @xcite . with these parameters",
