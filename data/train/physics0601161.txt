    "decomposing linear mixtures ( superpositions ) into their components is a problem occurring in many different branches of science , such as telecommunications , seismology , image processing , and biomedical signal analysis ( _ e.g. _ , eeg , ecg , fmri ) @xcite .",
    "blind source separation ( bss ) , in particular , deals with the case where neither the sources , nor the mixing matrix are known , the only available data being the mixed signals @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to bss is _ independent component analysis _ ( ica ) @xcite . in ica one typically first applies a principle component transformation to  prewhiten \" the data , _ i.e. _ to transform the covariance matrix into a unit matrix , and then uses some statistics going beyond second order ( _ e.g. _ mutual information or temporal correlations ) to minimize interdependencies between the reconstructed sources by a final rotation .    a similar problem arises in analytical spectroscopy , where one wants to decompose spectra of chemical mixtures into the contributions of individual components in order to identify the emitting ( or absorbing ) mixture constituents and quantify their abundances .",
    "mixture decomposition problems of this sort are classified in analytical chemistry as quantitative analysis of `` black '' multicomponent systems @xcite . compared to other applications of bss , here we have two additional problems :    * spectra of different chemically pure substances often show very large overlaps .",
    "this is in conflict with the central assumption of ica that the pure sources ( mixture components ) are statistically independent .",
    "one can relax this assumption partially ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , although one can hardly do without any assumption of this type . but , because of overlaps between spectra of similar compounds , this becomes a serious obstacle in spectral mixture decomposition . *",
    "in a vast majority of spectroscopic techniques , spectra are non - negative , as are also the coefficients of the mixing matrix ( concentrations ) .",
    "this gives rise to constraints which are not easily taken into account in typical ica algorithms that heavily rely on linear algebra @xcite .",
    "this would not be problematic by itself ",
    "in other applications signals are often non - negative , too .",
    "but it does pose a very serious problem , if , as is usually the case , there are spectral regions where some of the sources have zero ( or very small ) intensity @xcite . in this case , prewhitening will in general produce spectra violating the non - negativity constraints , and restoring them later will be far from trivial .    for these reasons ,",
    "this  multivariate spectral curve resolution \" ( mcr ) problem @xcite has led to a variety of chemometrics methods ( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . generally , these algorithms resemble ica in that they perform blind recovery of spectra and concentrations from the spectra of mixtures only , using no or little _ a priori _ information about mixture composition and/or about pure spectra . in view of the problems mentioned above",
    ", some of these mcr methods are less ambitious than ica and estimate only feasible ranges for spectra and concentrations ( see , for instance , a recent monte carlo approach @xcite and references therein ) . also , the mcr analysis is often facilitated by including some additional information such as unimodality and closure ( or mass balance ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of overlap between spectra can be reduced by estimating their dependencies not from the spectra @xmath0 directly , but from their second derivatives @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another approach developed in chemometrics is based on the identification of `` pure variables '' @xcite for all mixture components .",
    "a pure variable is a frequency ( wavelength ) at which only one of the components contributes .",
    "the pure variables , thus , approximately mark the regions where at least one of the spectral components is guaranteed to be independent from all others .",
    "this idea is central to several advanced chemometrics algorithms , _",
    "e.g. _ , ksfa @xcite , simplisma @xcite , ipca @xcite and smac @xcite .",
    "also , band - target entropy minimization ( btem ) has been recently proposed which involves an explicit ( made by visual inspection ) choice of spectral features ( target regions ) to be retained in the course of constrained optimization @xcite . while efficient and highly flexible , supervised band selection has the drawbacks of being neither fully automated , nor completely blind .    in order to cope with the non - negativity problem , several methods have been proposed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , non - negativity is incorporated in an approximate way already in the the basic decomposition algorithm . for a discussion see ref .",
    "while the above are general purpose bss methods , there exist more specialized chemometrics ( mcr ) algorithms designed to use non - negativity ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in many of them ,",
    "some variant of principle component analysis is used to first prewhiten the data , _",
    "i.e. _ to minimize the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix . in a class of algorithms known as mcr - als , prewhitening and the interdependence minimization",
    "are done as in standard ica , but non - negativity is then enforced in a postprocessing step using the alternating least squares ( als ) technique @xcite .",
    "in general , this gives better results than the algorithms without als .",
    "but , since the interdependencies between the sources are not checked during the als step , one runs the risk of worsening them .",
    "in addition to that , applying _ post facto _ corrections to restore essential properties which were present in original data , but which were ruined by the main part of an algorithm , appears rather awkward conceptually .",
    "here we argue that a more straightforward strategy is not only possible , but actually leads to de - mixing algorithms with notably improved performance .",
    "our approach is conceptually very simple and is based on mixture decomposition into _ strictly non - negative least dependent _ components . unlike other ica methods , it does not resort to prewhitening .",
    "instead , we split the linear de - mixing transformation into small random steps such that ( i ) on each step the non - negativity is preserved _ exactly _ , and ( ii ) the dependencies between the components tend to be reduced ( the _ mutual information _ ( mi ) is minimized non - greedily ) .",
    "since greedy minimization would lead to trapping in local minima of mi , we use a metropolis - hastings monte carlo strategy @xcite . the algorithm ( which we term snica , for stochastic non - negative independent component analysis )",
    "is explained in the next section .",
    "the numerical results presented here show that our new method is more efficient than previous mcr algorithms , including ica and ica - als type methods @xcite based on the same mi estimator .",
    "as in most ica and mcr approaches , we start out with the linear mixture model    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the matrix of mixed signals ( observed spectra ) , @xmath4 are pure sources ( spectra of individual mixture components ) , and @xmath5 is the matrix of their concentrations ( mixing matrix ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is a square @xmath6 matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of sources @xmath7 is the same as the number of mixtures . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are of size @xmath8 , where the number @xmath9 of frequencies in the spectra is much larger than @xmath7 . the task is to estimate blindly @xmath4 and @xmath5 , given only @xmath3 . in our current setting the pure spectra and concentrations are assumed to be non - negative and we seek a solution ( an estimate for @xmath4 ) in the form of statistically least dependent components @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being an estimate for @xmath5 up to scaling and permutation of components ( ambiguities inherent to the linear mixture model ) .",
    "true and estimated mixing matrices can be compared using the amari index @xmath12 which is a good measure of decomposition quality @xcite .",
    "the amari index vanishes when the recovered concentrations differ from the true ones only in scaling and permutation of components , and it increases as the quality of decomposition becomes poor .",
    "thus , small , whereas @xmath13 generally characterizes unacceptably poor performance . ]",
    "values of the amari index are desirable .",
    "we assume that each column vector @xmath14 is a realization of the same vector - valued random variable @xmath15 , and we look for solutions where its @xmath7 components ( _ i.e. _ , the estimated individual spectra ) have least mutual information . for a multivariate continuous random variable with given marginal and joint densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the mutual information is defined as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the differential entropies @xcite .",
    "mutual information is zero if and only if the @xmath21 are strictly independent ( _ i.e. _ , their joint density factorizes , @xmath22 ) , and it is positive otherwise . notice that the mi is sensitive to all types of dependencies , not only linear correlations .    to assess the dependencies between the estimated spectra ( given by rows of @xmath23 ) we use the precise mi estimator based on nearest neighbor statistics , denoted here as @xmath24 , developed in ref .",
    "it is derived from the kozachenko - leonenko estimate for shannon entropy @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the digamma function , @xmath27 is twice the distance from the point @xmath28 to its @xmath29-th neighbor , @xmath30 is the dimension of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the volume of the @xmath30-dimensional unit ball , and @xmath9 is the length of sample . mutual information could be computed by estimating the entropies ( [ hy]),([hym ] ) separately , with the same value of @xmath29 , and using eq .",
    "( [ mi ] ) .",
    "but this would involve very different scales in the marginal and joint spaces , leading to different biases .",
    "looking for nearest neighbors on the same scale in the joint @xmath33 and marginal @xmath21 spaces significantly increases the chance that the biases in @xmath34 and @xmath35 cancel .",
    "this reduces the bias of the mi estimate . since eq .",
    "( [ kl ] ) holds for any value of @xmath29 , one can first look for @xmath29 nearest neighbors in the joint space and then use the hyper - rectangles defined by them to calculate the number of neighbors in the marginal spaces . the estimate for mi is then : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the numbers of nearest neighbors in the spaces @xmath38 ; @xmath39 denotes the average over all points @xmath40 .",
    "implementation details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    statistical errors in this mi estimator decrease with @xmath29 , while systematic errors increase .",
    "empirically , we found that the decomposition performance is best for the values of @xmath29 in the range 10 - 20 , reflecting a balance between these two types of errors .",
    "also , spectral curve resolution by ica was shown to be more efficient if performed in the derivative space @xcite , therefore in all simulations discussed below we estimate the mi from the second derivatives of spectra with respect to frequency .    with this numerical measure of dependence , we can formulate the mixture decomposition problem as minimization of @xmath24 under the linear de - mixing transformation @xmath41 , subject to the non - negativity constraint is not enforced explicitly , but it will be nonetheless satisfied to high accuracy . ] @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast to more traditional ica methods that proceed by splitting the de - mixing matrix into a prewhitening transformation ( eliminating linear correlations ) and subsequent rotations @xcite , we approach the above constrained optimization with a monte carlo strategy . to this end , the de - mixing matrix @xmath43 is factorized into small steps , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , where each @xmath46 is chosen randomly and is either a shear transformation @xmath47 in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) subspace , or a rotation @xmath48 in a 3d subspace ( see below ) .",
    "the sequence of moves starts with @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( identity matrix ) .",
    "a move @xmath51 is immediately rejected , if it results in at least one negative component @xmath52 . otherwise ( _ i.e. _ , if all @xmath53 ) , it is accepted with probability one , if it leads to less dependent components , @xmath54 , while it is accepted with probability @xmath55 , if @xmath56 . here",
    ", @xmath57 is a fictitious temperature .",
    "this is the famous metropolis - hastings markov chain monte carlo method @xcite . in order to make the method more greedy at later stages , when @xmath58 is already close to the optimum , we use a simple annealing schedule @xcite where we start with high values of @xmath57 and decrease it successively .",
    "since both @xmath48 and @xmath47 matrices act only on low - dimensional subspaces ( and are the identity in the complements ) , the difference @xmath59 in each step can be computed from information in a 2d or 3d subspace only @xcite .",
    "the convergence to the global solution is monitored by computing the full dimensional mutual information @xmath60 , which guarantees that the least dependent , although not necessarily independent , components are reached .    in our method ,",
    "the mutual information is used to direct the search in the global space , whereas the non - negativity constraint is important in that it restricts solutions to physically meaningful subspace .",
    "this constraint has strongest effect , if large parts of the constraint boundaries @xmath61 , are populated by the pure sources , as then any linear transformation is likely to violate non - negativity .",
    "this happens when each pure spectrum has a high chance to be occasionally close to its zero baseline .",
    "such sources are called well - grounded @xcite and are common in spectroscopy .",
    "the idea of using 2d shear transformations in tandem with the non - negativity constraint was first proposed in the context of  positive matrix factorization \" @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath62 representing a shear @xmath63 in the @xmath64 subspace is obtained from identity matrix by adding one off - diagonal element , @xmath65_{lm}=   \\delta_{lm } + \\alpha \\delta_{li } \\delta_{mj},\\ ; \\;i \\ne j \\in [ 1,k ] ; \\;\\ ; l , m=1,2,\\ldots , k.\\ ] ]    ) and the amari index ( @xmath66 ) of incomplete ( c ) and successful ( d ) decompositions . ]",
    "while 2d shear transformations are sufficient to decompose two - component mixtures , they appear to be too restrictive to sample efficiently higher dimensional de - mixing matrices . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the minimization through a sequence of shears can easily get trapped in local minima of the mi landscape .",
    "one such case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ trap ] in which a three - component mixture of exemplary infrared spectra is considered .",
    "first , decomposition was attempted using only 2d shears , and fig .",
    "[ trap]c shows the components found by constrained minimization .",
    "this configuration corresponds to a local minimum of mi ( compare to fig .",
    "[ trap]a and notice the values of mutual information and very poor decomposition performance , @xmath67 ) . since the components have reached the constraint boundaries and a minimum of the cost function has been found to lie on this boundary , further de - mixing shears can be accepted only by increasing @xmath24 , which can be very slow .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ trap]c suggests that the configuration needs to be rotated in such a way that , afterwards , the three principal `` beams '' of points could be brought close to the coordinate axes ( and mi be decreased further ) by subsequent shears .",
    "this works indeed , and gives the correct pure components with high precision , as seen in fig .",
    "[ trap]d .",
    "the rotations needed to improve the efficiency are around the space diagonals in randomly chosen 3d subspaces .",
    "let us denote by @xmath68 the matrix which performs a rotation by the angle @xmath69 around the diagonal in the positive octant of the subspace spanned by the components @xmath70 .",
    "it has the elements @xmath71 in the subspace spanned by @xmath70 , while it is the unit matrix in the complement , @xmath72 for @xmath73 . in the results shown below",
    ", random rotations and shears are used in ratio 1:1 .    of course , more sophisticated combinations of affine transformations @xcite can be designed to sample the de - mixing matrix .",
    "this might improve the performance of the algorithm further , especially in higher dimensions .",
    "but it is not clear whether the added complexity would be worthwhile .    as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ shearmat]),([rotm2 ] ) , the proposed moves @xmath47 and @xmath48 are parameterized by the `` angle '' @xmath69 . for each monte carlo step its value",
    "is chosen randomly from some suitable range @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "to realize an adaptive step - size control ( where @xmath75 is adjusted according to the progress of optimization ) , we use the following update rule    @xmath76    with the factors @xmath77 , @xmath78 to be determined empirically . in our simulations we took @xmath79 , @xmath80 with initial @xmath81 ,",
    "although the decomposition performance was found to be practically insensitive to precise values of @xmath82 ( see next section ) .",
    "for the temperature annealing , we used rather simple schemes with only 2 or 3 cooling steps , with the temperature in the last step chosen close to zero .",
    "this is because we found that the detailed annealing schedule had no significant effect on the final results .",
    "it means , however , that the cpu times needed in the following simulations might not be optimal .",
    "the initial value of temperature @xmath83 was chosen of the order of the mutual information of pure mixture components .",
    "choosing @xmath83 too high leads to unfocused search , while choosing it too small increases the risk to get trapped in false minima . both can result in poor performance , whereas our empirical choice of @xmath83 ensured efficient decomposition in most cases .",
    "at each temperature , the sequence of de - mixing moves is terminated when the mutual information has reached its global minimum , according to some stopping criterion . in our code",
    "we kept track of the minimum of @xmath60 during the entire run , @xmath84 minimization is stopped when @xmath85 does not decrease any more during the last @xmath86 monte carlo steps , and the de - mixing matrix @xmath87 that corresponds to @xmath85 is given as output .",

    "judging from the most probable performance ( peaks of the @xmath66 distributions ) and the minimal achieved values of @xmath66 , snica clearly outperformed the other two algorithms .",

    "one of the mixture sets ( @xmath132 ) was also processed by two representative ica algorithms : the widely used fastica @xcite ( for references on its chemometrics applications see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and recently developed radical @xcite ( both algorithms rely on decorrelation of data by pca ) .",

    "snica was applied to this data set with a 3 step annealing schedule taking @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 for all three steps .",
    "the monte carlo decomposition was done in the full 14 dimensional space ( using second - order savitzky - golay smoothing differentiation @xcite with a 5th order polynomial and a 51 point window ) , thus 14 components were resolved .",
    "then , we selected only 6 components which had the largest average contributions to the mixed signals ( this is similar to retaining only the components with largest eigenvalues in the pca dimension reduction ) .",
    "these 6 most intense components were compared to the pure sources ( table  [ tbl ] ) . on this data",
    "set , the estimates produced by snica are more accurate than those obtained by simplisma and btem without als and compare favorably with the results obtained by milca and als - versions of these algorithms .",
    "notice that in order to produce accurate estimates simplisma needs als postprocessing corrections @xcite ( see also fig .  [ fastica]b ) . with these corrections",
    ", its performance seems to match closely with snica , although higher statistics simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fastica]b ) suggest that this might not be typical . also ,",
    "snica resolved all 6 components equally well , whereas the other methods produced 2 - 3 relatively poorly estimated spectra ( notably , acetone and aldehyde appeared to be the most problematic due to their highly overlapping spectra ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new stochastic technique , snica , for blind recovery of non - negative well - grounded sources from their linear mixtures . avoiding the pca decorrelation as being counterproductive in certain cases ,",
    "our algorithm is based on a metropolis monte carlo constrained minimization of mutual information between recovered sources .",
    "the de - mixing transformation is obtained as a sequence of random shears and rotations that resolves the least dependent strictly non - negative components .",
    "the snica approach can be related to some other pca - free ica methods ( for example , infomax @xcite or tdsep @xcite ) in that it does not resort to the somewhat arbitrary decorrelation constraint @xcite introduced by pca .",
    "instead , it is replaced in snica by the non - negativity constraint which reflects a natural property of spectral signals in the present application .",
    "pca simplifies and speeds up the decomposition considerably , but should be taken with caution .",
    "if the sources are strongly correlated , then pca produces components which , in spite of being uncorrelated , are completely unphysical . if an ica method ( consisting of a rotation of prewhitened components ) is used without als postprocessing , it has no chance to undo the errors made by pca prewhitening . for a specific example",
    "see ref .",
    "als postprocessing improves the situation , but only partially .    here",
    "we have tested snica in spectral curve resolution on a representative set of mixture problems and experimental data .",
    "our results indicate that the algorithm is superior in performance to its pca - based counterpart ( milca , with the same mutual information estimator ) including the als - assisted version .",
    "we also found our algorithm to outperform simplisma+als which represents a good reference point among the state - of - the - art curve resolution chemometrics techniques .",
    "the method presented in this paper performs blind decomposition , but the use of additional _ a priori _ information about pure components ( such as , _ e.g. _ , sparseness of spectral signals ) might possibly improve the performance further . in blind separation of multivariate time sequences ,",
    "the perfomance of milca was greatly enhanced if also mutual informations at different time lags were included in the minimization @xcite . in principle , the same can be done for snica , but we have not yet made any tests to see how practical this is .",
    "the assumptions of non - negativity and statistical independence of source signals are met in a variety of practical problems in analytical spectroscopy and beyond .",
    "the range of applications of blind non - negative spectral mixture decomposition spans almost all quantitative analytical approaches that rely on spectroscopic measurements and subsequent mixture analysis , including , _",
    "e.g. , _ hyperspectral remote imaging @xcite , microscopy of nano - structures @xcite and biomedical samples @xcite , and separation of independent light sources in multi - frequency astrophysical observational data @xcite .",
