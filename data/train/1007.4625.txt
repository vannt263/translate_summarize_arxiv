    "lately , there has been considerable interest in low - dimensional spin models that exhibit frustration @xcite .",
    "a very interesting class of such systems with unique physical properties is chain compounds consisting of edge - sharing @xmath3 units @xcite .",
    "the frustration in these compounds arises from the competition of the ferromagnetic ( f ) interaction @xmath4 of nearest neighbor ( nn ) spins and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath5 . an appropriate model describing the magnetic properties of such copper oxides",
    "is so called f - af spin chain model , the hamiltonian of which has a form @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this model is characterized by the frustration parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the ground state properties of the quantum @xmath2 f - af chain have been intensively studied last years @xcite .",
    "it is known that the ground state of model ( [ h ] ) is ferromagnetic for @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "the quantum phase transition to the incommensurate singlet phase with helical spin correlations takes place .",
    "remarkably , this transition point does not depend on a spin value , including the classical limit @xmath12 .",
    "however , the influence of the frustration on low - temperature thermodynamics is less studied , especially in the vicinity of the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point .",
    "it is of a particular importance to study this problem , because edge - sharing cuprates with @xmath13 ( for example , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are of special interest @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present the low - temperature thermodynamics of quantum @xmath2 model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath16 can be studied only either by using of numerical calculations of finite chains or by approximate methods . on the other hand , the classical version of model ( [ h ] )",
    "can be studied by analytical methods giving exact results at @xmath17 .",
    "of course , the question arises about the relation of these results ( in particular , for the susceptibility ) to those of the quantum model .",
    "it is known @xcite that quantum and classical ferromagnetic chains ( @xmath18 ) have universal low - temperature behavior . as was noted in ref.@xcite",
    "the physical reason of this universality is the consequence of the fact that the correlation length at @xmath17 is larger than de broglie wavelength of the spin waves .",
    "this property is inherent in the frustrated ferromagnet too .",
    "though such universality for the frustrated ferromagnetic chains is not strictly checked at present , one can expect that the universality holds on for the f - af chain as well .",
    "therefore , the study of classical model ( [ h ] ) can be useful for the understanding of the low - temperature properties of the quantum f - af chains .    at zero temperature classical model ( [ h ] )",
    "has long range - order ( lro ) for all values of @xmath19 : the ferromagnetic lro at @xmath20 and the helical one at @xmath21 . at finite temperature",
    "the lro is destroyed by thermal fluctuations and thermodynamic quantities have singular behavior at @xmath17 . in particular , the zero - field magnetic susceptibility @xmath22 diverges . for the 1d heisenberg ferromagnet ( hf ) @xmath23 @xcite . at @xmath24",
    "the susceptibility is @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath26 is similar to that for the quantum @xmath2 f - af model @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath27 vanishes at the transition point .",
    "as it was noted in ref.@xcite this fact indicates the change in the critical exponent .",
    "in this paper we focus on the low - temperature behavior of the classical f - af chain near the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point . at",
    "first we consider the case @xmath28 , i.e. the f - af model exactly at the transition point .",
    "this problem is interesting on its own account , because the spectrum of low - energy excitations is proportional to @xmath29 rather than @xmath30 as for the hf model .",
    "it means that the critical exponents characterizing the low - temperature behavior of thermodynamic quantities at @xmath28 can be different from those for the hf chain . besides , the method developed for the study of the transition point can be generalized to investigate the vicinity of the transition point .    at the ferromagnet - helimagnet transition point",
    "@xmath11 it is convenient to rewrite hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the form @xcite : @xmath31    in eq.([h14 ] ) we put @xmath32 and omit unessential constant .    in the classical approximation",
    "the spin operators @xmath33 are replaced by the classical vectors @xmath34 of the unit length . in what follows we use the continuum approach replacing @xmath34 by the classical vector field @xmath35 with slowly varying orientations , so that @xmath36 where the lattice constant is chosen as unit length .    in the low - temperature limit",
    "the thermal fluctuations are weak , so that neighbor spins are directed almost parallel and continuum approach ( [ dsdx2 ] ) is justified . using the continuum approximation ,",
    "hamiltonian ( [ h14 ] ) goes over into the energy functional of the vector field @xmath35 : @xmath37    this energy functional is a starting point of the investigations of model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath28 .",
    "the partition function is a functional integral over all configurations of the vector field on a ring of length @xmath38 @xmath39    it is useful to scale the spatial variable as @xmath40    then , the partition function takes the dimensionless form @xmath41 where the rescaled system length is @xmath42 . the partition function ( [ zxi ] ) and the correlation function @xmath43 are the objects of the current study .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we consider the planar version of spin model ( [ etr ] ) at @xmath28 .",
    "for this more simple model we demonstrate the technique of the calculation of the correlation function .",
    "we show that the thermodynamics of this classical one - dimensional model reduces to the zero - dimensional quantum problem of a particle in a potential well . in sec.iii the classical continuum f - af model at the transition point",
    "is studied . in this case",
    "the partition function describes a quantum particle in an axially symmetrical potential well .",
    "we obtain the exact expressions for the susceptibility and the structure factor . in sec.iv the behavior of the uniform susceptibility in the helical phase at @xmath44",
    "is studied and compared with the experimental data for the edge - shared compounds and with the results for the quantum @xmath2 model .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec.v .",
    "and the appendix contains some technical aspects of the calculation of the correlation function .",
    "we begin our investigation of the thermodynamics in the transition point with a more simple planar spin version of model ( [ etr ] ) , when all spin vectors lie in one plane and have only two components : @xmath45    such order of study is methodically justified , because the technique of the correlation function calculation is similar for both planar and original three - component spin models , but it is easier to demonstrate on the simple planar model .    in terms of @xmath46",
    "the hamiltonian transforms to @xmath47 and the partition function becomes @xmath48 where the prime denotes the space derivatives @xmath49 .    in general , when one deals with the field theory containing the second or higher order derivatives one has to follow the ostrogradski prescription @xcite .",
    "however , as will be demonstrated below , in our case we can avoid such complications and calculate the partition function and correlation functions in a more simple way .",
    "since the hamiltonian contains only derivatives of the field @xmath50 , the partition function can be rewritten in terms of a new field @xmath51 where @xmath52    to calculate the partition function we utilize well - known equivalence of the @xmath53-dimensional statistical field theory with the @xmath54-dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "it is obvious in advance that partition function ( [ zq2d ] ) describes a quantum particle in a potential well @xmath55 at ` temperature ' @xmath56 .",
    "however , we will follow all intermediate steps , because we will need them in the subsequent calculations of the correlation function .",
    "the transition amplitude ( or propagator ) of a particle located initially at @xmath57 , and finally at @xmath58 takes the form of a path integral @xmath59    then , imposing the periodic boundary conditions @xmath60 and integrating over @xmath61 , we obtain the partition function in a form @xmath62    in our case we replace @xmath63 by an imaginary time @xmath64 and partition function ( [ zq2d ] ) takes the form of a path integral of a quantum particle in a potential well : @xmath65 where the lagrangian is @xmath66    the momentum @xmath67 is @xmath68 and the hamiltonian is @xmath69    the corresponding schrdinger equation describes a quantum anharmonic oscillator : @xmath70    the spectrum of equation ( [ schr2d ] ) is calculated numerically : @xmath71 and the wave function @xmath72 for the lowest level @xmath73 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "now the exponent of @xmath74 can be represented as follows : @xmath75 and the partition function becomes @xmath76    as expected , we obtain the partition function of a quantum anharmonic oscillator at ` temperature ' @xmath77 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath78",
    "only the lowest eigenvalue @xmath79 gives contribution to the partition function , @xmath80      the scalar product of vector fields located on distance @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 = \\cos % \\left [ \\int_{0}^{l}\\theta ^{\\prime } ( x)dx\\right ] = \\re \\left [ \\exp \\left ( i\\int_{0}^{\\mu } q(\\xi ) d\\xi \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{s0sl2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "then , the correlation function can be represented as a ratio of two functional integrals : @xmath84   \\label{corr2d}\\]]where denominator @xmath85 is already calculated ( see eq.([z2d ] ) ) and @xmath86    the latter path integral is clearly divided on two parts @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 can be represented as @xmath90 where the propagators @xmath91 and @xmath92 are @xmath93 and periodic boundary condition @xmath94 is applied .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath95 is given by eq.([l02d ] ) and @xmath96    the propagator @xmath92 is calculated straightforward using eqs.([propag ] ) and ( [ exph02d ] ) : @xmath97    but the propagator @xmath91 requires special treatment , because @xmath98 and the corresponding quantum hamiltonian @xmath99 are non - hermitian : @xmath100    non - hermitian operator @xmath101 can be represented as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are eigenfunctions of direct and conjugate eigenvalue equations : @xmath105    the normalization conditions for @xmath106 and @xmath107 are @xmath108    equations ( [ h1eigen2d ] ) for hamiltonian ( [ h1q2d ] ) transform to each other by complex conjugation operation .",
    "this implies that eigenfunctions in eq.([h1eigen2d ] ) satisfy the relation @xmath109 .",
    "thus , we need to solve only one of the differential equations ( [ h1eigen2d ] ) .",
    "the numerical calculations show that all eigenvalues of eq.([h1eigen2d ] ) are real and positive .",
    "a few lowest eigenvalues are presented in eq.([eta2d ] ) , @xmath110    real and imaginary parts of @xmath111 for the lowest level @xmath112 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "now , the propagator @xmath91 can be expressed through the solutions of eq.([h1eigen2d ] ) , @xmath113 where we used the identity @xmath114    then , substituting eqs.([z2eq ] ) and ( [ z1eq ] ) into eq.([zcz1z2 ] ) and integrating over @xmath115 we obtain @xmath116    the main contribution in the thermodynamic limit @xmath117 is given by the lowest value @xmath118 and @xmath89 reduces to @xmath119    substituting @xmath83 into eq.([zceq2 ] ) , we find from eq.([corr2d ] ) the correlation function @xmath120    the correlation length is governed by the lowest eigenvalue @xmath121 and equals to @xmath122    so , the low - temperature behavior of the correlation length is different from the hf model , where @xmath123 .",
    "now , the structure factor can be also calculated @xmath124    in the low - temperature limit , the expansion of the structure factor for any @xmath125 has the form @xmath126    the first term in eq.([skt02d ] ) is zero , because @xmath127and @xmath128 is even function of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the structure factor is given by the second term in eq.([skt02d ] ) , which can be calculated exactly @xmath129 , \\hat{h}_{1}\\right ] \\left\\vert \\psi _",
    "{ 0}\\right\\rangle = -\\frac{1}{4 } \\label{term2}\\ ] ]    therefore , the low - temperature asymptotic of the structure factor is @xmath130    hence , the susceptibility @xmath131 for @xmath132 remains finite in the low - temperature limit : @xmath133    the fact that @xmath134 ( instead of @xmath135 for hf chain ) is a consequence of the fact that the excitation spectrum becomes @xmath136 at the transition point .",
    "for @xmath137 the structure factor ( [ sk2d ] ) diverges at @xmath17 as @xmath138    the sum in eq.([s02d ] ) is calculated numerically and gives the factor @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic susceptibility behaves as @xmath1 @xmath140    in conclusion of this section we emphasize that the exact calculation of the correlation function for the planar spin model demonstrates that the critical exponents at the transition point of the f - af chain can differ from that for the hf chain .",
    "the calculation of the correlation functions for the classical three - component spin model ( [ h14 ] ) is to a large extent similar to the planar spin case and to avoid duplications we will often refer to the previous section .",
    "so , in this section we consider the continuous model described by energy functional ( [ etr ] ) where three - component vector field @xmath141 has the constraint @xmath142 .",
    "since in the partition function the integration occurs over all possible spin configurations , we are free to choose any local coordinate system .",
    "it is convenient to choose it so that the @xmath85 axis at the point @xmath63 is directed along the spin vector @xmath141 , so that the spin vector @xmath143 .",
    "let us introduce a new vector field @xmath144    the constraint @xmath142 converts to the relations for @xmath145 : @xmath146 where the prime denotes the space derivatives @xmath147 .",
    "then , the hamilton function in eq.([zxi ] ) transforms to @xmath148    here we see that the constraint @xmath149 effectively eliminates the z component of @xmath150 from the hamilton function .",
    "therefore , henceforth we deal with the @xmath151 and @xmath152 components of the vector field @xmath150 only , and we denote a two - component vector field by @xmath153 .",
    "the partition function in terms of @xmath154 takes the form : @xmath155    similar to the planar spin case , we treat the partition function as path integral ( [ zl02d ] ) for the quantum mechanics of a single particle with the hamiltonian @xmath156 where @xmath157 is two - dimensional laplace operator .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ h0q3d ] ) commutes with the z - component of the angular momentum @xmath158 and eigenstates @xmath159 of the corresponding schrodinger equation @xmath160 are divided to subspaces of azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the wave function @xmath162 describes a particle with the azimuthal quantum number @xmath163 in 2d axially symmetrical potential well @xmath55 . numerical solution of eq.([eigen03d ] ) gives the lowest levels for @xmath164 @xmath165    the wave function @xmath72 for the lowest eigenvalue @xmath166 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "now , by the analogy with the planar spin case eqs.([exph02d])-([z2d ] ) we obtain the partition function as a sum of exponents over all quantum numbers @xmath19 and @xmath163 : @xmath167    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath168 only the lowest level @xmath166 survives and the partition function is @xmath169      since we work with the local coordinate system directed so that the spin vector is directed along the @xmath85 axis , in order to find the scalar product of spin vectors @xmath170 we need to express the vector @xmath171 in the local coordinate system located at the point @xmath172 .",
    "this can be represented as a chain of successive rotations describing the trajectory @xmath35 [ see the appendix ] : @xmath173 where @xmath174 can be expressed through the vector @xmath175 as @xmath176)}{% \\vec{q}^{2}}=\\sigma _ { y}q_{x}-\\sigma _ { x}q_{y}+\\sigma _ { z}\\frac{% q_{x}q_{y}^{\\prime } -q_{y}q_{x}^{\\prime } } { q_{x}^{2}+q_{y}^{2 } } \\label{omega}\\ ] ]    in this equation we used relations ( [ constrain ] ) for the @xmath85 component of @xmath150 and @xmath177 .",
    "then , taking into account that the spin vectors are directed along the @xmath85 axis of local coordinate system @xmath178 , the scalar product of spin vectors @xmath170 becomes : @xmath179    similar to the planar case , the correlation function can be written as a ratio of two path integrals ( [ corr2d ] ) , where the denominator @xmath85 is given by eq.([z3d ] ) and the numerator represents the following path integral : @xmath180    then , repeating the arguments presented in eqs.([zc])-([z2eq ] ) , we arrive at the problem of the calculation of the propagator : @xmath181 where the lagrangian and the corresponding quantum hamiltonian are @xmath182    substituting @xmath183 from eqs.([a7 ] ) , the hamiltonian takes the matrix form @xmath184 where @xmath74 is defined by eq.([h0q3d ] ) .",
    "operator @xmath101 is non - hermitian and the exponent of @xmath101 can be represented as @xmath185where three - component eigenvectors @xmath186 and @xmath187 satisfy the corresponding eigenvalue equations @xmath188    the normalization conditions are @xmath189    making the same procedure for non - hermitian operators as for the planar spin case we obtain the correlation function in a form @xmath190    only the eigenfunctions @xmath191 and @xmath192 are present in the above equation , because according to eq.([s0sl3d ] ) we need only the element @xmath193 of the resultant matrix .",
    "since the wave function @xmath194 has zero angular momentum , then only the sector @xmath195 of eqs.([eigenh13d ] ) gives the contribution to the correlation function . in this sector",
    "the wave functions depend only on @xmath196 , the hamiltonian is simplified so that we have to solve a pair ( instead of three ) differential equations for @xmath197 and @xmath198 : @xmath199    the conjugate eigenvalue problem for @xmath200 in eq.([eigenh13d ] ) transforms to exactly the same differential equations ( [ ode2 ] ) for the functions @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath203 is found from the solution of eq.([ode2 ] ) by the relation @xmath204 and the the normalization conditions ( [ n3d ] ) transform to @xmath205    one can see that equations ( [ ode2 ] ) describe a two - level system in an axially symmetric potential well @xmath55 , where two levels with angular momenta @xmath195 and @xmath206 are coupled by non - hermitian transition operator .",
    "the spectrum of this system of equations turns out to be real and positive as for the planar case and a few lowest levels are : @xmath207    the reality of the spectrum @xmath208 has an important consequence : the correlation function ( [ corr3d ] ) decays on large distances without oscillations .",
    "the wave function @xmath197 for the lowest level @xmath209 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "as follows from fig.3 the behavior of the functions @xmath210 and @xmath197 are similar .",
    "therefore , the main contribution to the correlation function , the structure factor and the susceptibility is given by the level @xmath211 .",
    "the correlation function and the structure factor are given by equations ( [ correq2d ] ) , ( [ sk2d ] ) with the substitution @xmath212 for @xmath213 and eigenvalues presented in eqs.([e3d ] ) , ( [ eta3d ] ) .",
    "therefore , the correlation length defined by the lowest eigenvalue @xmath211 behaves similar to the planar spin case @xmath214 , but the numerical factor is different : @xmath215    the low - temperature asymptotic of static structure factor @xmath216 and the susceptibility @xmath217 for @xmath132 is calculated in a similar way as for the planar spin case ( see eq.([skt02d ] ) ) resulting in @xmath218    for @xmath137 the structure factor @xmath219 is defined by eq.([s02d ] ) with the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "the numerical calculation of the sum gives @xmath220    thus , we have arrived at the final result for the magnetic susceptibility of the classical spin model at the transition point : @xmath221    we see that the planar spin model gives correct critical exponent for the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "in the preceding sections we have considered the low - temperature thermodynamics at the transition point @xmath11 . likewise it is possible to extend the developed method for the study of the vicinity of the transition point . in this case",
    "an additional term @xmath222 appears in energy functional ( [ etr ] ) , which after rescaling of spatial variable ( [ xi ] ) forms the scaling variable @xmath223    especially interesting is to study the vicinity of the transition point when values @xmath224 and @xmath225 are small but the parameter @xmath226 is fixed .",
    "all the steps in derivation of the expressions for the correlation function are exactly the same as was done for the transition point and only the form of the potential well in the corresponding differential equations ( [ ode2 ] ) is modified : @xmath227 .",
    "numerical solution of the corresponding differential equations allows to find the correlation function , the static structure factor @xmath216 and the susceptibility as a function of @xmath226 . as follows from eqs.([s03d ] ) and ( [ chi03d ] ) the susceptibility can be rewritten as @xmath228    thus , the normalized susceptibility @xmath229 is a universal function of @xmath226 .    on the ferromagnetic side of the transition point ( @xmath230 )",
    "the susceptibility diverges at @xmath17 , but the exponent changes from @xmath231 to @xmath232 , so that the susceptibility becomes @xmath233 .",
    "the behavior of the susceptibility in the helical phase is more interesting .",
    "the dependence of the uniform susceptibility @xmath234 on the normalized temperature @xmath235 in the helical phase is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the characteristic features of this dependence are the maximum of @xmath236 at @xmath237 and the finite value of @xmath234 at @xmath17 .",
    "the latter fact is a classical effect and can be destroyed by quantum fluctuations . in the quantum @xmath2 f - af model the ground state",
    "is believed to be gapped ( though the gap can be extremely small @xcite ) and so @xmath238 at @xmath17 . in real materials",
    "interchain interactions cause the 3d spiral lro and the susceptibility can remain finite at @xmath239 .",
    "the obtained dependence @xmath240 is in a qualitative agreement with those observed in the edge - shared compounds with @xmath241 close to @xmath242 ( @xmath243 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite ) . as follows from eq.([chit ] ) the location of maximum of @xmath240 is at @xmath244 and @xmath245 , i.e. with the increase of @xmath241 the maximum of @xmath26 shifts to higher temperatures and the magnitude of the maximum @xmath246 decreases .",
    "these dependencies of @xmath247 and @xmath246 on the frustration parameter @xmath241 are also in accord with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath248 agrees also with the numerical results for the uniform susceptibility obtained by tmrg and exact diagonalization methods for the quantum f - af chain with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath249 is similar to that obtained by the tmrg calculations in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , the classical model catches the physics of quantum spin systems in the helical phase and , therefore , the developed method for the classical spin model represents a useful tool for the investigation of the low - temperature behavior of the quantum systems .",
    "we have obtained the exact results for the low - temperature thermodynamics of the classical f - af model at the frustration parameter @xmath11 , where the ground state phase transition from the ferromagnetic to the helical phase occurs .",
    "the main result relates to the behavior of the zero - field susceptibility @xmath26 and the correlation length @xmath250 .",
    "it is shown that the critical exponents of @xmath26 and @xmath250 are changed from @xmath232 to @xmath231 and from @xmath251 to @xmath252 correspondingly , when @xmath253 from the ferromagnetic side .",
    "we note that the critical exponents are the same both for the classical spin model and for the planar model . in the present paper",
    "we have considered a continuum version of the model ( [ h14 ] ) .",
    "however , the low - temperature asymptotes of @xmath26 and @xmath250 of the continuum and lattice models coincide .",
    "in fact , lattice model ( [ h14 ] ) can be studied on a base of the transfer matrix method adapted in ref.[25 ] to include the nnn interaction .",
    "we have shown [ 26 ] that the corresponding transfer - integral equations are reduced at @xmath17 to the differential equations ( [ eigen03d ] ) , ( [ ode2 ] ) with the same eigenfunctions and eigenvalues , so that the exact low - temperature asymptotic of the susceptibility coincides with eq.([chi03d ] ) . besides , the structure factor @xmath216 for the lattice model is given by eq.([sk2d ] ) under substitution of @xmath254 for @xmath30 in the dominator of eq.([sk2d ] ) .",
    "at the same time , calculations in a frame of path integral method are essentially simpler and clear in comparison with those in the transfer - integral approach .",
    "it is interesting to compare the exact expression for the susceptibility at the transition point with the results found by approximate methods .",
    "one of this methods is the modified spin - wave theory ( mswt ) proposed by takahashi @xcite to extend the spin - wave theory to the low - dimensional spin systems without lro .",
    "another approximate approach is the expansion of the thermodynamics of the @xmath53-vector classical model in powers in @xmath255 @xcite ( usually , up to the first order ) .",
    "remarkably , both methods give the true critical exponent @xmath231 for the susceptibility @xmath256 .",
    "however , the numerical coefficient @xmath257 differs from the exact one .",
    "for example , the mswt result is @xmath258 .",
    "the @xmath255 expansion for the classical spin model ( [ h14 ] ) gives @xmath259 in the zeroth order and @xmath260 in the first order in @xmath255 .",
    "the comparison of these values of @xmath257 with the exact one shows that these approximate methods give a satisfactory agreement ( within @xmath261 ) with the exact coefficient .",
    "it is worth to note that the mswt gives the exact low - temperature asymptotic of @xmath262 for the classical ferromagnetic chain ( @xmath263 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mswt gives the exact result for @xmath26 at @xmath17 for the quantum ferromagnetic chain with @xmath2 as well .",
    "as was noted in introduction , the quantum and the classical ferromagnetic chains have universal low - temperature properties .",
    "the low - temperature susceptibility of the ferromagnetic chain is described by the scaling function universal for any value of spin @xmath264 . for the f - af model at @xmath11",
    "there is no rigorous proof of such universality , though mswt confirms this hypothesis .",
    "if this universality holds in the case @xmath11 then we expect that the quantum f - af chain has the same critical exponent of @xmath26 as in the classical model .",
    "we have also considered the low - temperature thermodynamics in the vicinity of the transition point . in this case the properties of the system are governed by the scaling parameter @xmath265 . on the ferromagnetic side of the transition point ( @xmath230 ) the susceptibility transforms smoothly to @xmath233 at @xmath266 , which describes the change in the exponent at @xmath17 .",
    "the susceptibility in the helical phase for a fixed value of @xmath44 behaves as @xmath267 at @xmath268 , which means that the uniform susceptibility remains finite at @xmath17 .",
