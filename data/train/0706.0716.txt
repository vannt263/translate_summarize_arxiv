    "in a series of recent papers @xcite , two of us have developed a rigorous method for dividing a complex system into its parts based on density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory , partition - theory ( pt ) , was used to construct a formulation of chemical reactivity theory ( crt ) @xcite which , for the first time , is consistent with the underlying density - functional theory @xcite and is richer in structure than the preexisting crt @xcite .    in pt @xcite , a sharp definition of the individual parts into which the whole system is partitioned is achieved first by selecting the nuclei of each putative part and maintaining these in the positions in which they occur in the whole and then requiring that the sum of the electron densities of the parts , each of which is treated as though isolated , add up exactly to the electron density of the whole ( the density constraint ) .",
    "the electron densities of the parts are then to be determined by minimizing the sum of the density functionals of the individual parts with respect to the densities of the parts subject to the density constraint .",
    "the density functional used , that of ref.@xcite ( pplb ) , allows for the existence of noninteger numbers of electrons on each part , necessary e.g. for the definitions of electronegativity @xcite and hardness @xcite , key indices of chemical reactivity @xcite , and for incorporating covalent bonding between inequivalent parts .",
    "the minimization proceeds via a legendre transformation , which introduces a reactivity potential @xmath0 as the lagrange multiplier of the density constraint .",
    "thus , the formalism can become computationally complex .",
    "first the electron density of the whole system must be determined .",
    "then , the densities of the parts must be determined simultaneously with @xmath1 , all of which is required to set the stage for the determination of mutual reactivities between parts , though certain self - reactivities can be determined for each species alone without reference to a larger system @xcite .    accordingly ,",
    "in the present paper , we develope the partition theory in detail for an extremely simple system to exhibit its main features explicitly .",
    "the illustrative system is an analog of the hydrogen molecule in which the electrons move in one dimension along the molecular axis without interacting , and the nuclear coulomb potentials are replaced by attractive delta - function potentials . as a consequence of these extreme simplifications , many quantities of interest can be determined analytically in a transparent manner , including the electron density of the molecule , of its parts ( the  atoms \" ) , and the reactivity potential at all internuclear separations .    in section 2 ,",
    "the model is defined and the molecular density obtained . in section 3 , the parts are defined , shown to have one electron each , and a polar representation for their wave functions found which facilitates the minimization . in section 4 ,",
    "the minimization is carried out , resulting in an euler equation for the polar angle @xmath2 of that representation .",
    "@xmath2 is found in section 5 and used to determine the reactivity potential @xmath1 in section 6 .",
    "the principle of electronegativity equalization formulated in refs.@xcite and @xcite is shown to hold in section 7 .",
    "also in section 7 , the hardness @xcite of the isolated h atom is calculated , shown to be nonzero , and correlated with the strength with which its electron is bound .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the model is a caricature of the real system , meaningful features of the partition theory are indeed illustrated by it , as discussed in the concluding section , 8 .",
    "our task is to partition an analog of the h@xmath3 molecule in which two electrons move independently in @xmath4-function nuclear potentials in one dimension into parts , analogs of h atoms .",
    "each h atom has , by symmetry , only one electron , so the need for the pplb density functional is avoided .",
    "indeed no explicit use of density - functional theory is required for either the molecule or the atoms . the ground - state wave function",
    "@xmath5 and energy @xmath6 of an isolated h atom are ( atomic units are used throughout):@xmath7 in eq.([e : psi_0 ] ) , @xmath8 is the strength of the @xmath4-function potential . to draw the analogy closer to real hydrogenic atoms , one could equate @xmath9 to the nuclear charge .",
    "the ground - state energy @xmath10 of one electron moving independently in the two @xmath4-function potentials centered at @xmath11 is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 satisfies = 2z/(1+)[e : kappa ]  .the corresponding wavefunction is : @xmath14 where b=^1/2 ^ -1/2  ; [ e : b]note that @xmath15 as @xmath16 ( united atom limit ) and @xmath17 as @xmath18 ( separated atom limit ) .",
    "the two - electron molecular electron density is given by : n_m(x)=2|_m(x)|^2  , [ e : n_m]and the total energy of the molecule is e_m(n=2)=2e_m(n=1)=-^2  , [ e : e_m]where @xmath19 is the number of electrons in the molecule .",
    "the chemical potential of the molecule is therefore _",
    "m = e(2)-e(1)=e(1)=-^2/2  .[e : mu_m ]",
    "we now partition the molecule into two parts @xmath20 , each having a real one - electron wave function @xmath21 , localized around @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , so that @xmath24 is given by n_m(x)=n_1(x)+n_2(x )  , [ e : density_constraint]where @xmath25 is the electron density of each part @xmath20 treated independently .",
    "atomic \" wavefunctions are given by : _",
    "( x)=  .[e : psi_a]they are mirror images of each other , _",
    "2(x)=_1(-x )  , [ e : mirror]and both are normalized .",
    "we now decompose the @xmath21 into their symmetric , @xmath26 , and antisymmetric , @xmath27 , parts by a rotation within the function space they span , @xmath28 the rotation leaves  lengths \" within the space invariant so that n_m=_s^2+_a^2  .we next introduce @xmath29 , a polar angle in the function space , _",
    "s=  ,  _",
    "a=  , [ e : parity_for_psispsia]so that _ 1,2= ( ) [ e : parity]because the @xmath21 are non - negative , @xmath30 can not exceed @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore @xmath32 must be an odd function of @xmath33 , to ensure @xmath21 is also odd .",
    "this also guarantees normalization of @xmath21 .",
    "to apply pt @xcite , begin with the original hamiltonian h=_i=1,2p_i^2-z_i=1,2  .[e : original_h]then divide the system into overlapping regions , each with a given number of electrons . in this case , we choose one electron on the left , and the other on the right .",
    "thus we have two 1-electron problems : h_=+v _  ,   v_1,2=-z(xa )  .[e : hparts]the pt problem is to minimize = ( _ 1,h_1_1)+(_2,h_2_2 )  , [ e : functional]subject to normalization of the wavefunctions , but also to the constraint that the total density equal the original molecular density , eq.([e : density_constraint ] ) .",
    "( without the latter constraint , we d obviously find @xmath35 ) . in the polar representation of sec.3 , both density and normalization constraints",
    "are automatically satisfied , so the partition problem becomes simply minimizing @xmath36 as a functional of @xmath37 . that functional is @xmath38\\right.}\\\\&&~~+\\left.\\half n_m\\left[(v_1+v_2)+(v_1-v_2)\\sin 2\\t\\right]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "varying it yields = dx\\{n_m+(v_1-v_2)n_m2 }  .integrating by parts , as usual , leads to @xmath39 for @xmath36 to be stationary with respect to arbitrary variations @xmath40 of @xmath37 , both terms contributing to @xmath41 in eq.([e : int_parts ] ) must vanish . the euler equation which results from the vanishing of the second term in eq.([e : int_parts ] ) is @xmath42 the vanishing of the first term in eq.([e : int_parts ] ) sets the boundary condition at infinity on the euler equation ( [ e : euler ] ) .",
    "there are two possibilities , the vanishing of @xmath43 at infinity or the fixing of @xmath37 there so that @xmath40 must vanish . as we shall see in section 5 , imposing the latter results in an unacceptable divergence in @xmath43 at infinity .",
    "we therefore impose the boundary condition (x)=0  ,  |x|=  .[e : boundary ]",
    "eq.([e : euler ] ) becomes ( n_m)=0  ,  |x|a  , [ e : beta_eq]subject to the boundary conditions eq.([e : boundary ] ) and @xmath44 the general solution of ( [ e : beta_eq ] ) is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants .",
    "as implied above in section 4 , if @xmath46 does not vanish @xmath43 diverges exponentially at infinity , according to eq.([e : general ] ) , because @xmath48 goes exponentially to zero , so , in accordance with eq.([e : boundary ] ) , @xmath46 vanishes for @xmath49 , and @xmath34 is constant there , .",
