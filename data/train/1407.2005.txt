    "it is well - known that the faddeev - popov construction , which is the standard analytic method for fixing the gauge , is not sufficient in order to treat the infrared regime of qcd .",
    "the problem originates in the existence of gribov copies  @xcite which are ignored in the faddeev - popov construction .",
    "gribov copies do not play any role in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "for that reason , the yang - mills action complemented by the faddeev - popov action is a good starting point to analyze both gauge - invariant and non - invariant quantities at momentum scales much bigger than @xmath0 gev .",
    "however , at low momenta the question of how to include the effect of gribov copies in a lagrangian still remains unsolved even though some ideas have been already developed . among those ,",
    "the most popular is probably the gribov ",
    "zwanziger proposal @xcite .",
    "it consists in restricting the functional integral to the first gribov region by adding several new fields .",
    "unfortunately it was shown in @xcite that the first gribov region also includes many gribov copies so that the gribov ambiguity is not completely removed . moreover ,",
    "the gribov - zwanzinger procedure relies on some formal manipulations that are not fully justified from first principles .    in the past decades ,",
    "lattice simulations improved considerably and became the most reliable technique to describe the infrared region of qcd @xcite .",
    "in particular , quenched lattice simulations in landau gauge @xcite and unquenched simulations @xcite have demonstrated that the gluon propagator acquires a finite value at low momentum , contrary to the original belief .",
    "numerical simulations succeeded in convincing the community that , in this gauge , the gluon propagator behaves in the ir as if it was massive .    even before that , the infrared regime was studied through several semi - analytical methods , among which the more popular were based on dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations . depending on the precise implementation , two solutions were observed , called scaling and decoupling ( or massive ) solutions .",
    "the scaling solution is characterized by a gluon propagator that vanishes as a power law at low momentum @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the decoupling solution corresponds to a finite gluon propagator @xcite , in agreement with lattice results .",
    "acknowledging the fact that no analytic method can deal with the gribov ambiguity in a fully consistent way , two of the authors have proposed an alternative strategy to study analytically the ir regime of the theory .",
    "the idea relies on working with the simplest lagrangian which reproduces lattice results . to account for the decoupling solution observed on the lattice in a minimal way ,",
    "the faddeev - popov lagrangian is complemented by a mass term for the gluons . in euclidean space ,",
    "the lagrangian density reads : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coupling constant , @xmath3 are euclidean dirac matrices satisfying @xmath4 , the flavor index @xmath5 runs over the @xmath6 quark flavors and @xmath7 the latin indices correspond to the @xmath8 gauge group , @xmath9 are the generators of the algebra in the fundamental representation and @xmath10 are the structure constants .",

    "( [ eq_cf ] ) is that it is very simple and allows to perform perturbative calculations very easily .",
    "moreover , we found @xcite that there exist renormalization schemes in which the coupling constant remains finite at all momentum scales .",

    "the quenched one - loop calculations for the two - point @xcite and three - point @xcite correlation functions compare very well with lattice simulations .",

    "[ zonas ] the hybrid calculation is taken as the central value ( that includes a rough estimate of the two - loop contributions ) and the error band estimated as explained just before is represented by the shaded area .",
    "we clearly see that higher corrections for the gluon propagator are small and compatible with the discrepancy between our one - loop results and the lattice data .",
    "the two - loop contribution to the function @xmath38 is small but does not seem sufficient to make the one - loop results compatible with lattice data .",
    "this could be related with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which was not treated here .",
    "finally , the corrections to @xmath39 are large and can explain the discrepancy between the lattice data and the 1-loop results .",

    "the effect of the gribov copies is minimally encoded in a mass term for the gluons .",
    "we find that the gluon and ghost propagators are reproduced with high precision .",
    "we estimate the higher order corrections to be small which seems to indicate that the curci - ferrari model reproduces well the lattice data .    on the other hand , one loop calculations are not enough to describe properly all the properties of the quark sector .",
    "the one loop contribution to @xmath102 function is very small and it vanishes if the gluon mass goes to zero in landau gauge .",
    "that is why the two loops contributions are important and we have to take them into account if we want to quantitatively reproduce the @xmath102 function behavior .",
    "the mass of the quark is correctly reproduced even though the accuracy is not as good as it is for the gluon sector .",
    "it is even unclear if a perfect matching for this quantity by such a simple one - loop calculation is possible given that we have not studied the influence of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this analysis remains for a future work .",
