    "motivated from the recent spectroscopic experimental results on the appearence of a nodal gap on the deeply underdoped cuprate sc@xcite , there has been few studies@xcite to uncover such new and unexpected results . in an earlier work ,",
    "we have already discussed about the topological study of d - wave sc in presence of sdw order and compared with the above cuprates data@xcite . however , from the study of the group algebra@xcite , it is known that the coexistence of any two non - commuting order parameters produces a third order parameter . in case of sdw and d - wave",
    "superconductivity , there is a third , dynamically generated , order parameter@xcite .",
    "this happens to be a triplet sc here . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the coexistence of sdw and d - wave superconductivity which can generate a triplet and non - zero center of mass superconducting order parameter .",
    "we , thus start with a hamiltonian on a @xmath5d square lattice as ,    @xmath6    here , @xmath7 is the bare dispersion , @xmath8 is the onsite coulomb interaction , @xmath9 are the pairing strengths for @xmath10-wave and @xmath11-wave superconductivity and @xmath12 is the number of sites .",
    "we model the bare dispersion in the tight - binding approximation on a 2d square lattice as @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) denotes creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electron with spin @xmath16 at @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the sum of @xmath19 over the reduced brillouin zone ( rbz ) .",
    "we express the wave - vector @xmath19 in units of @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the lattice parameter of the underlying square lattice .",
    "@xmath22 is the sdw nesting vector in 2d .",
    "we assume here a commensurate sdw so that @xmath23 .",
    "the staggered spin magnetization is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "since we will be discussing about three order parameters below , the crystal symmetry of them should be such that the commutator of any two of them should give the third one .",
    "for this reason , if @xmath25 is assumed to be of singlet d - wave symmetry , the sdw state guarantees that @xmath26 should be of triplet type .",
    "so we get the singlet interaction @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 are attractive .",
    "the sc order parameters are defined as , for singlet state , @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "the triplet order is decoupled in the main band and in the magnetic band as @xmath33 while @xmath34 .",
    "this is the reason why the time - reversal symmetry remains invariant in the triplet sc state . after substituting these mean - field orders ,",
    "the total hamiltonian reads as ,    @xmath35 + m_{0}\\sum_{k,\\sigma}^{'}\\sigma c^{\\dagger}_{k+q,\\sigma}c_{k,\\sigma } \\nonumber\\\\   + \\sum_{k}^{'}[\\bigtriangleup^{1}_{k}(c^{\\dagger}_{k,\\uparrow}c^{\\dagger}_{-k,\\downarrow}+   c_{-k,\\downarrow}c_{k,\\uparrow}-c^{\\dagger}_{k+q,\\uparrow}c^{\\dagger}_{-k - q,\\downarrow}-   c_{-k - q,\\downarrow}c_{k+q,\\uparrow } ) ] \\nonumber\\\\   + \\sum_{k}^{'}[\\bigtriangleup^{2}_{k}(c^{\\dagger}_{k,\\uparrow}c^{\\dagger}_{-k - q,\\downarrow}-c^{\\dagger}_{k+q,\\uparrow}c^{\\dagger}_{-k,\\downarrow } ) + \\bigtriangleup^{2\\ast}_{k }   ( c_{-k - q,\\downarrow}c_{k,\\uparrow}-c_{-k,\\downarrow}c_{k+q,\\uparrow } ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the above hamiltonian",
    ", the nesting property in the band dispersion i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the order parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 have been employed . in the momentum space ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be expressed as , @xmath42 where the four - component spinor @xmath43 is , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian matrix @xmath45 in this basis is written as , + @xmath46    in what follows , we study the energy spectrum of the above hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eqn.(3 ) ) is diagonalized and the quasiparticle spectrum is obtained as ,    @xmath47 .",
    ", corresponding to coexistence of sc order parameters @xmath48 and that of the sdw order parameter showing fully gapped spectrum . for illustration , here ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath49 ev , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ev . ) ]    it is obvious that the energy spectrum is fully gapped and the gap closes only when the following condition is satisfied .",
    "@xmath54    it is found from the straight forward calculation @xcite that this condition is equivalent to    @xmath55    the second equation in eqn.(5 ) is met only when @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these two points give the same following condition ,    @xmath58    when the above condition ( eqn.(6 ) ) is satisfied , the energy gap closes .",
    "thus , we find the topologically trivial and the non - trivial regions as shown in fig.2",
    ". we will explore the chern number associated with such phases in the next section .",
    "order and sdw order in the case where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath61-axis labels the parameter @xmath62 and the @xmath63-axis labels the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "integer @xmath2 labels the chern number of the coexistence of sc and sdw . ]",
    "to examine the topological phase transition(tpt ) , it is convenient to use the dual hamiltonian instead of the original one .",
    "this can be done through a constant unitary transformation matrix @xmath65 as ,    @xmath66    resulting    @xmath67    in the limit @xmath68 , the dual hamiltonian @xmath69 in the leading order around @xmath70 and @xmath60 gives rise to the following two @xmath71 block - hamiltonian as ,    @xmath72    we notice here that the above dual hamiltonian have a close similarity to the hamiltonian of the spinless chiral @xmath73 supercondutor discussed in@xcite .",
    "in order to study the phase diagram of this hamiltonian one needs to determine the phase boundaries corresponding to gapless regions since the topological invariants can not change without closing the bulk gap . for the present model ,",
    "the critical lines are determined by solving equation(8 ) , i.e. , @xmath74 for the upper(lower ) blocks in the case with @xmath75 and @xmath60 .",
    "the phase becomes topological in the region when @xmath76 whereas it is trivial for @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , one can draw a phase diagram for any @xmath78 point in the rbz .",
    "e.g. for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we get the same condition for the topological phase transition to occur from second condition of eqn.(5 ) , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to the following eqn .",
    "of the critical lines @xmath82 .",
    "the topological phase exist in the region @xmath83 whereas it is trivial for @xmath84 .",
    "based on the finiteness of the chern number given below , we propose a phase diagram in the in the former case ( fig .",
    "2 ) in the @xmath85 plane which distinguishes the topological and non - topological phases .",
    "this is the new result of the present manuscript .",
    "thus , it is obvious that both these phases are separated by a quantum phase transition line .",
    "the chern numbers in the topological phases of fig .",
    "2 are calculated below .",
    "it is well known that the topological phases can be characterized by @xmath86 @xmath87 . for a specific model hamiltonian @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , the pauli matrices and @xmath90 $ ]",
    ", the chern number can be calculated from the expression    @xmath91    where the unit vector @xmath92 characterizes a map from the brillouin zone vector @xmath19 to unit sphere .",
    "the chern number simply counts the number of times @xmath93 wraps around the unit sphere as a function of @xmath19 . in the present model",
    "the chern number for the case @xmath76 is calculated as @xmath94 whereas it vanishes when @xmath77 . in presence of sdw order",
    ", the @xmath3 sc state has odd parity and @xmath95=0 symmetry which is a fully gapped system . due to sdw order",
    ", it has @xmath96 spin rotation along say , @xmath97-axis and @xmath98 which corresponds to class @xmath99 in accordance with the symmetry classification of altland and zirnbauer@xcite .",
    "this means that there are infinite number of distinct topological sc with @xmath95 conservation and are labeled by an integer which is the chern number@xcite .",
    "this is associated with the number of chiral fermion edge modes .",
    "in order to see the evolution of edge states in this model(coexistence of @xmath3 sc and sdw order ) , we studied it numerically on a cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary condition in @xmath63-direction and open boundary condition in @xmath61-direction .",
    "we solved the eigen - value problem where the hamiltonian has been diagonalized on @xmath100=100 sites .",
    "the energy dispersion @xmath101 versus @xmath102 has been obtained and hence the edge states has been shown in fig .",

    "two chiral edge states characterize the topological phase in this model .",
    "sc in presence of sdw order on a cylindrical geometry .",
    "parameters are chosen as , @xmath103 ev , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 for a lattice of @xmath107 sites . ]    [ fig.3 ]    it is well known that the vortex of a topological sc with odd topological quantum number @xmath2 carries an odd number of majorana zero modes .",
    "the existence of such zero modes in the vortex core of a @xmath3 sc is shown to be due to index theorem@xcite . in the present case , since the sc is coexisting with sdw order , the topological classification is always trivial for class @xmath99 in 1d . since the existence of the zero modes in the vortex core",
    "is determined by the symmetry classification in one space dimension less , the topological @xmath3 sc with the chiral edge modes wo nt support such zero energy vortex bound state@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we summarize the main findings of the present manuscript .",
    "we consider a possible coexistence of singlet sc and sdw which induces a triplet sc component as well .",
