    "an @xmath15 linear collider ( lc ) is probably the most compelling case as the next - generation particle collider for high - precision physics .",
    "one of the lc options , the international linear collider , has recently completed its technical design , and there is hope that funding to begin its construction could be gathered up in a near future , especially if japan s proposal to host it goes forward .",
    "the physics motivation for a linear collider has been strengthened even more after the discovery of a new particle compatible with a higgs boson at the lhc whose interactions could be studied at the lc with sufficient precision to test the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism of the standard model .",
    "the lc would also probe the dynamics behind the symmetry breaking mechanism through high - precision measurements of the properties of the top quark , the heaviest of the fundamental fermions and thus the most strongly coupled to the ewsb sector .",
    "the flexibility in energy of a lc would allow the top ",
    "antitop threshold behaviour to be mapped out in detail .",
    "particularly , a theoretically well - defined top mass with a total uncertainty below 100  mev could be extracted by means of such a threshold scan  @xcite , substantially beyond the precision achieved at tevatron , @xmath16  gev  @xcite , and at the lhc at 7 tev , @xmath17  gev  @xcite .",
    "while the statistical uncertainty of the top mass measurement at the lhc is expected to improve in future runs , the systematic ( theoretical ) uncertainties related to the connection between the mass parameter used in the theory and the one measured in the experiment are a limiting factor for further improving the accuracy of the top - quark mass measurement at hadron colliders .",
    "the perturbative nature of the @xmath18 system which is produced near threshold in @xmath15 annihilation was recognized long ago  @xcite , and the leading - order coulomb force was treated to all orders in @xmath19 using a non - relativistic approach  @xcite .",
    "the matching between qcd and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite provided the necessary pieces to compute the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections to the @xmath18 production cross section  @xcite in the region defined by relative velocities of the top and antitop @xmath20 . in this fixed - order approach which achieves a systematic summation of terms @xmath21 with @xmath22 at order n@xmath23lo , up to n@xmath24lo corrections to resonant @xmath18 production",
    "are known  @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "the advances in the formulation of the non - relativistic effective theory allowed for renormalization - group improved calculations for the @xmath18 system produced at threshold .",
    "within the potential nrqcd ( pnrqcd )  @xcite and velocity nrqcd ( vnrqcd )  @xcite formalisms the systematic summation of potentially large logarithmic terms @xmath25 originating from ratios of the top - mass scale @xmath26 , the non - relativistic three - momentum @xmath27 and the kinetic energy @xmath28 , was carried out to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) order  @xcite for the total cross section , which accounts for all terms proportional to @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the effective field theory ( eft ) computations above account for the qcd interactions among nearly on - shell top and antitop quarks .",
    "however , the predictions can only be evaluated for all threshold energies after the top decay width is included in the eft quark propagator , @xmath31 , thus providing an infrared cutoff for the top kinetic energy .",
    "the counting @xmath32 is naturally enforced in this way , which is also justified numerically in the standard model , where @xmath33  gev due to the electroweak interaction . once the top width is included ,",
    "the physical final state is @xmath34  at least if we assume that @xmath35 , and consider @xmath36 bosons as stable . beyond leading order",
    ", the production of the final state @xmath34 can also occur through non - resonant processes that do not involve a nearly on - shell @xmath18 pair , and which are thus not described by the standard nrqcd formalism . in the counting scheme where the electroweak coupling scales as @xmath37 , the leading non - resonant effects are nlo for the total cross section and reproduce the full - theory contributions where one of the @xmath8 pairs is produced from a nearly on - shell top , while the other is produced either from a highly virtual top or directly without an intermediate top . the unstable - particle eft  @xcite provides the framework for a systematic computation of resonant and non - resonant contributions while maintaining an expansion in the small parameters of the problem .",
    "the nlo non - resonant corrections , calculated within this formalism in  @xcite , represent the leading electroweak correction to the @xmath18 cross section below the threshold , where the lo ( resonant ) result rapidly vanishes , reaching up to 20% .",
    "this had been noticed before in refs .",
    "@xcite , obtaining the dominant nlo non - resonant corrections when moderate invariant - mass cuts on the @xmath8 pairs are applied within the so - called _ phase - space matching _ approach , based on vnrqcd .    aside from the sizeable corrections induced by the non - resonant production",
    ", there is a further conceptual reason to term the pure qcd resonant result alone that is usually shown in the literature as incomplete . the resonant cross section at nnlo shows _ finite - width divergences _ , _ i.e. _ uncanceled divergences proportional to the top width , which in dimensional regularization have the form @xmath38 and arise from the logarithmic divergences in the imaginary part of the two - loop non - relativistic correlation function .",
    "these are also known as _ phase - space divergences _ because they can be traced back to uv - divergences in the nrqcd @xmath18 phase space integrations  @xcite that originate because the unstable - particle propagators describing the top quark in the eft allow for contributions to the forward - scattering amplitude from intermediate top and antitop states which have arbitrarily large invariant masses ( see @xcite for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "the occurrence of finite - width divergences is an evidence that the pure resonant result must be supplemented with additional short - distance information from the full @xmath39 process . in the unstable - particle eft",
    "the additional input is given by diagrams corresponding to off - shell top quark decay that contribute to the non - resonant part at nnlo  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we show that the nnlo non - resonant contributions generate infrared divergences when the momentum of the virtual top - quark lines approaches the endpoint at @xmath40 , which precisely cancel the finite - width divergences ( [ eq : sigmadiv ] ) from the resonant part .",
    "this is proved by explicit computation of the nnlo non - resonant contributions , given by the @xmath41 corrections to the nlo non - resonant diagrams . for the extraction of the endpoint - singular terms",
    "we use the method of regions to asymptotically expand the loop and phase - space integrals around the endpoint . as a byproduct",
    ", we obtain the first terms in the expansion in @xmath42 of the nnlo non - resonant contributions , where @xmath7 is a cut on the invariant masses of the top and antitop decay products satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "this approximation provides an accurate estimate of the nnlo non - resonant contributions to the @xmath18 inclusive cross section with moderate invariant - mass cuts in the @xmath8 systems , and , as we prove , confirms the result obtained for the same observable within the phase - space matching approach in  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in section  [ sec : eftdivs ] we recall the issue of the uncanceled divergences proportional to the top width in resonant @xmath18 production at nnlo and collect the total divergent result . the framework to account for non - resonant production at nlo and nnlo",
    "is described in section  [ sec : nonresonantdivs ] .",
    "the origin of the endpoint singularities that arise in the non - resonant amplitudes and the method used for their analytic extraction is explained in the latter section , which includes the introduction of the scale @xmath7 .",
    "the results for the endpoint - singular contributions to the nnlo non - resonant corrections are summarized in section  [ sec : results ] for the various sets of diagrams .",
    "readers not interested in the individual results might jump directly to section  [ sec : nnlores ] , where the formula containing all endpoint - singular non - resonant nnlo contributions to the @xmath43 cross section with an invariant - mass cut @xmath7 is given and the cancellation of the finite - width divergences against the endpoint divergences is made explicit . in section  [ sec : comparison ] we compare our findings with those of the phase - space matching approach  @xcite and also comment on the approximation to the nnlo non - resonant contributions obtained in another work  @xcite by expanding in @xmath44 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : finalresults ] we compare the non - resonant contributions computed in this work with the nlo ones as a function of the cut @xmath7 , and then show their numerical impact as a function of the energy relative to the leading - order qcd calculation of resonant @xmath18 production .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "close to the top  antitop production threshold , the @xmath45 final state is produced from @xmath15 collisions predominantly by intermediate top and antitop quarks with small virtuality ( resonant ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the non - relativistic kinetic energy .",
    "the qcd dynamics of the nearly on - shell top and antitop quarks can be described within the nrqcd approach , an effective field theory that is built upon integrating out the hard modes with scale @xmath49 .",
    "since the inclusive cross section for the @xmath39 process can be obtained from the @xmath50 cuts of the @xmath15 forward - scattering amplitude , the resonant contribution to this observable is given in the eft formalism by the imaginary part of the matrix element @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) are operators describing the production ( decay ) of the resonant @xmath54 pair from @xmath15 , and @xmath55 are short - distance coefficients . at leading order in the non - relativistic expansion",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , at nnlo the resonant amplitude  ( [ eq : ares ] ) shows an uncanceled finite - width divergence in the imaginary part .",
    "the finite - width divergences arise from two - loop diagrams with a coulomb gluon and a @xmath59-suppressed insertion .",
    "the insertion may correspond to a @xmath59-suppressed potential , an nnlo correction to the kinetic lagrangian , a @xmath58-wave or a @xmath59-suppressed @xmath56-wave current producing the top ",

    "a simple argument can be used to explain why the two methods yield the same series expansion in @xmath6 of the non - resonant contributions , despite the different starting points in the respective calculations . in our method , the full - theory amplitude is expanded first assuming that top - quark lines are off - shell , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath484 , which drops the top self - energy corrections from the full - theory top - quark propagator , and then the @xmath6 series arises from further expanding the resulting amplitude around the on - shell limit , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath485 .",
    "the last expansion is equivalent to considering that the momentum @xmath145 is potential , since the antitop on - shell condition sets @xmath486 . on the other side ,",
    "the psm computation starts from the full - theory amplitude expanded for nearly on - shell ( potential ) top quarks , with @xmath487 , producing @xmath488 and @xmath489 corrections .",
    "then the latter are transformed into @xmath490 terms from hard-@xmath145 momentum regions ( @xmath484 ) where we can expand the integrand taking the off - shellness of @xmath145 much larger than the non - relativistic scales @xmath460 and @xmath491 .",
    "the first important observation is that in both methods a double expansion of the integrand in @xmath145 ( according to hard and potential region scalings ) is performed , but in reversed order . in the method of regions , such double expansions are known as overlap contributions  @xcite . adopting the notation of the latter reference",
    ", we can denote as @xmath492 the integrand resulting from expanding the full - theory integrand  @xmath493 ( including the dirac delta functions from the cutkosky rules ) according to first hard and then potential momentum , and @xmath494 the same expansion taken in the reversed order , as effectively done in the psm approach . within the expansion by regions , especially in simple cases with only two relevant regions ( here hard and potential ) , double expansions usually yield the same doubly - expanded integrand , whether the two expansions are executed in one order or the other .",
    "so we can expect that the identity @xmath495 holds .",
    "let us consider in the following at first the case without invariant - mass restrictions , so that @xmath493 does not depend on any cut  @xmath7 .",
    "then our second important remark is that the integration of the integrand @xmath496 over @xmath145 vanishes in dimensional regularization , @xmath497 because after doubly expanding the integrand according to hard and potential momenta , there is no scale left in the integrand ( recall that we have not imposed any invariant - mass constraints in @xmath493 , so the integration limits are unbounded ) .",
    "if we now rewrite ( [ eq : fhp ] ) using @xmath498 as @xmath499 we readily identify the first term as the taylor series in @xmath6 of the non - resonant contributions computed in our approach for an invariant - mass cut of the form ( [ eq : deltam ] ) .",
    "the second term corresponds to the resonant nrqcd amplitude further expanded assuming hard  @xmath145 and integrated outside the region of @xmath120 allowed by the invariant - mass cuts .",
    "that is precisely the quantity that yields minus the series in the first term of  ( [ eq : psm ] ) with powers of  @xmath7 , obtained in the phase - space matching approach .",
    "therefore , from ( [ eq : cancel ] ) we conclude that the psm contributions must be equal to the series expansion obtained with the unstable - particle eft , as we have shown by explicit computation up to terms of order @xmath482 .",
    "the equivalence between both series is lost at the order where terms coming from full - theory diagrams with just one top or antitop , or with no tops at all , which are not described by nrqcd , first contribute . as mentioned before ,",
    "these terms arise at nlo from diagrams @xmath151@xmath152 , and are of order @xmath500 .",
    "since the @xmath41 corrections to diagrams @xmath151@xmath152 do not introduce negative powers of @xmath141 , we also expect that the nnlo non - resonant contributions in the phase - space matching series start to differ from ours at order @xmath501 .",
    "the reasoning above also provides further insight on the regions ( of gluon momenta ) which contribute to the endpoint - singular nnlo corrections . in",
    "scaleless overlap contributions like  ( [ eq : fhp ] ) where the integrand is doubly expanded according to both regions , singularities from domains of hard and potential top momenta  @xmath145 cancel each other to yield zero .",
    "exactly the same cancellation of singularities happens between the contributions of the individual ( hard or potential ) regions , originating from the respective integration domain where the top momentum approaches the scaling of the opposite region : the ultraviolet singularities ( from the hard-@xmath145 limit ) present in the integrals of the resonant contribution ( which have been expanded for potential  @xmath145 ) are canceled by the endpoint singularities ( from the potential-@xmath145 limit ) of the non - resonant contribution ( whose integrals have been expanded for hard  @xmath145 ) .",
    "this cancellation occurs individually for the different scalings of gluon momenta .",
    "it is known that the @xmath165 finite - width divergences on the resonant side originate purely from potential ( coulomb ) gluons .",
    "so their cancellation must be provided purely by potential gluon momenta in the endpoint - divergent non - resonant diagrams .",
    "this is exactly what we have found in our calculation for the origin of the @xmath182 terms from potential - region contributions .",
    "similarly , it is known that ultrasoft gluons do not contribute to the total resonant nrqcd amplitudes at nnlo .",
    "so it comes without surprise that we observe a cancellation of the ultrasoft - region contributions to the endpoint - divergent non - resonant corrections ( see the remarks at the end of sec .",

    "the latter is generated in their approach because the scale @xmath505 in the top - quark propagators is kept as an infrared regulator for the ( infrared - divergent ) loop integration of the non - resonant amplitude , despite the fact that the integral is saturated by the region @xmath506 .",
    "let us remark that in our approach logarithms of the velocity can only appear in the resonant matrix elements , because the hard - momentum expansion performed in the non - resonant diagrams drops terms of order @xmath507 from the top - quark propagators and , as a consequence , an energy - dependence there only arises beyond nnlo as powers of @xmath491 .",
    "the infrared divergence in  @xcite is analogous to the @xmath182 endpoint divergences we find within the unstable - particle eft formalism , and must be compensated by an ultraviolet divergence arising from a resonant contribution in order to render the leading - order result in the @xmath407-expansion independent of the regularization scheme .. while the nnlo relativistic corrections to the resonant diagram with a coulomb potential , fig .",

    "the nnlo non - resonant corrections are also mandatory , because the purely resonant cross section contains at the same order an uncanceled ultraviolet divergence , @xmath558  ( [ divsigmatotal ] ) , which must be compensated by a divergence with opposite sign on the non - resonant side in order to yield a regularization - independent result for this observable . in this work",

    "the expanded integrals involve the scale @xmath462 of the invariant - mass cut in the @xmath8 system . in this way , apart from the @xmath165 divergences , we obtain the endpoint - singular terms @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 which correspond to the first terms in the expansion in powers of @xmath6 . this series provides a rigorous approximation of the nnlo non - resonant contributions to the @xmath325 cross section with symmetric invariant - mass cuts of size @xmath559 applied to the @xmath8 pairs , as long as @xmath525 is much smaller than the top mass but significantly larger than the top width ( equivalently , if @xmath560 ) .",

    "numerically we find that within the above range of invariant - mass cuts the nnlo non - resonant contributions produce a negative shift of about @xmath551 with respect to the leading - order @xmath18 cross section above threshold . for energies below the peak",
    ", where non - resonant production is known to dominate over the ( subleading ) resonant terms , the corrections reach up to @xmath562 .",
    "the presence of endpoint singularities in the nnlo non - resonant contributions represents an additional complication for their calculation , since these singularities have to be subtracted from the amplitude , together with the standard soft - collinear divergences due to gluon radiation .",
    "the analysis performed in this work , which identifies and evaluates the endpoint - singular terms , thus provides a necessary step towards the computation of the full set of nnlo non - resonant contributions to @xmath39 and , consequently , towards having a complete nnlo theoretical prediction for @xmath18 production near threshold that accounts for the effects related to top - quark decay in a consistent manner .",
