    "while collisional energy loss of a hard jet propagating through quark - gluon plasma has been estimated to be modest  @xcite : @xmath3 gev / fm , for accessible plasma temperatures , the induced radiative energy loss , as estimated  @xcite using the gunion - bertsch  @xcite non - abelian generalization of the bethe - heitler formula for qed is expected to be significantly larger with @xmath4 gev / fm .",
    "an uncertainty principle analysis in  @xcite leads to a simple estimate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mean transverse momentum of the radiated gluons . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model for non - abelian energy loss was developed and a class of multiple scattering diagrams lead to @xmath7 gev / fm independent of the path length .",
    "however , in bdmps  @xcite gluon rescattering diagrams in the medium were shown to induce a nonlinear enhancement of the energy loss because @xmath8 . the result for",
    "an incident very high energy jet penetrating a plasma of thickness , @xmath9 , in which the mean free path , @xmath10 , and the color electric fields are screened on a scale @xmath11 , is  @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the jet broadening due to multiple elastic scatterings of the jet in matter , and a factor of order unity is suppressed .",
    "this estimate is derived for the situation when the radiation formation length is large compared to the target thickness and the target is thick compared to the mean free path : @xmath14 in the other theoretical limit corresponding to landau",
    " pomeranchuk  migdal ( lpm )  @xcite regime in qed , @xmath15 , and the energy loss was shown to saturate as @xmath16 .",
    "the remarkable prediction that the non - abelian @xmath17 increases linearly with the plasma thickness in nuclear collisions , suggests that the total jet energy loss could increase quadratically with the nuclear size . however , several practical problems limit the application of the above results directly to observable jet quenching in nuclear collisions .",
    "first , jets are produced in such reactions with high initial virtualities in hard pqcd processes , and thus induced radiation from secondary interactions must compete with the usual broad gluon shower accompanying a hard pqcd event .",
    "second , the observable energy loss depends on the detailed angular distribution of the gluons . unlike in electrodynamics where the energy of the final electron and photon can be directly measured",
    ", the energy of a single parton is only measurable when it is kinematically well separated from other jets .",
    "this is because the observable hadron showers have wide angular distributions .",
    "nearly collinear partons in particular are not resolvable because they are absorbed into the coherent hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "therefore , in order to test experimentally the non - abelian energy loss of jets , @xmath18 of the induced gluon radiation must be known .",
    "the angular integrated energy loss , @xmath17 , is insufficient to predict its experimental consequences .",
    "third , for finite nuclei @xmath19 is not very large , and a large fraction of the jets are produced in the nuclear `` corona '' with @xmath20 .",
    "thus the form of the angular distribution for only a few collisions is needed .",
    "fourth , a problem specific to nuclear collisions is that the very large transverse energy background due to minijets ( the partons from which the dense quark - gluon plasma is made ) prevents the application of traditional transverse energy jet cone measurements of jets @xcite .",
    "therefore , jet quenching must be inferred from the systematics of leading hadrons at moderate @xmath21 gev relative to well know spectra in elementary nucleon - nucleon reactions .",
    "this step requires the interface of the parton level shower calculations with hadronization phenomenology .",
    "this paper is part i of a study of jet quenching concentrating on the formal problem of computing the angular distribution gluon radiation from off - shell jets produced in a dense but thin medium . in the subsequent paper ii  @xcite",
    ", we encode the results of this paper into a nuclear collision event generator ( hijing1.36  @xcite using the lund jetset  @xcite string fragmentation scheme for hadronization ) and compute the hadron inclusive jet quenching pattern .",
    "note that in a separate study  @xcite , the transverse momentum dependence of the lpm effect in qed was discussed in another formalism and compared to the analytic results for qcd derived in this paper .",
    "multiple interactions in qcd are complicated by the color charge of the radiated gluons .",
    "this leads to interference between the production amplitudes and the rescattering amplitudes that makes it impossible to factor the cross section into a product of the elastic cross section and the gluon distribution . in bdmps ,",
    "a great technical simplification was achieved by considering only the angular integrated @xmath22 , energy distribution . the freedom to shift the transverse momentum , @xmath23",
    ", integrations was used often to reduce the multiple collision problem into tractable form .",
    "in addition , a large @xmath24 and @xmath25 approximations were employed to convert the problem into an elegant equivalent schroedinger equation problem valid under the conditions that @xmath26 an alternative path integral approach proposed in  @xcite obtained similar results ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the continuum approximations developed in @xcite are not applicable to thin plasmas and more importantly they do not apply at all to the problem of computing the angular distributions .",
    "the main complication is that the angular distributions require a complete treatment of all gluon and jet final state interactions . in this paper",
    ", we simply follow the direct albeit tedious route of computing the sum of squares of all diagrams with finite number of rescatterings . in the thin plasma limit",
    ", the main simplicity arises from the fact that for @xmath27 the number of amplitudes @xmath28 is still small enough for practical calculations .",
    "historically , the on - shell single rescattering case , @xmath29 , was first considered by gunion and bertsch  @xcite ( gb ) .",
    "they estimated the hadron rapidity distribution due to gluon bremsstrahlung associated with a single elastic valence quark scattering in the low - nussinov model .",
    "the important difference compared to the problem addressed in this paper is that gb computed the non - abelian analog of the bethe - heitler formula while we are interested in the analog of radiative energy loss in sudden processes similar to the beta decay .",
    "the gb problem is to compute the soft radiation associated with a single scattering of an incident on - shell quark prepared in the remote past , i.e. , @xmath30 , relative to the collision time , @xmath31 . in our case , the radiation associated with a hard jet processes in nuclear reactions must take into account the fact that the jet parton rescatters within a short time , @xmath32 , after it is produced .",
    "the sudden appearance of the jet color dipole moment within a time interval @xmath33 results in a broad angular distribution of gluons even with no final state scattering .",
    "the induced radiation cased by rescattering necessarily interferes strongly with this hard radiation as indicated in  @xcite .    to model a thin plasma",
    ", we employ the static color - screened potential model as considered in gyulassy ",
    "wang ( gw ) @xcite . the scattering potential has fourier components @xmath34 here @xmath35 is proportional to the second order casimir of the @xmath36 dimensional representation @xmath37 of the jet parton , and @xmath38 . in principle , the @xmath39 target could be in the @xmath40 dimensional representation with casimir @xmath41 so that @xmath42 .",

    "lattice qcd calculations of @xmath11 indicate sizable nonperturbative corrections to the pqcd estimates for achievable temperatures .",

    "in sec  3.4 the interference form factors and their dependence on the detailed plasma geometry is derived .",
    "these form factors control how close the exact result is to the extreme factorization or the classical parton cascade limits . in sec .",

    "an additional form factor associated with the transverse profile of the target is derived that helps to identify the physical interpretation of the rearranged terms . in the simpler `` broad '' target case ,",
    "those form factors drop out . the induced gluon bremsstrahlung ( beyond self - quenching )",
    "is shown to be strongly suppressed relative to the classical limit due to the destructive lpm effect in qcd at small angles .",
    "however , the angular enhancement at large angles due to gluon rescattering remains a key feature .",
    "the more involved case of two scatterings is treated in sec .",
    "the analytical result shows a power law enhanced angular broadening of the gluon distribution relative to the case of @xmath29 .",

    "we apply this scaling to compute the angular integrated gluon energy spectrum , @xmath57 and the jet fractional energy loss @xmath58 .",
