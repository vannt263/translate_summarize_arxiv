    "the study of the multi - dimensional numerical cerenkov instability ( nci ) in electromagnetic particle - in - cell ( em - pic ) plasma simulations has attracted much renewed attention since the identification of this numerical instability as the limiting factor of lorentz boosted frame simulations for laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nci is also a limiting factor in relativistic collisionless shock simulations @xcite .",
    "past and recent work has shown that the nci inevitably arises in em - pic simulations when a plasma ( neutral or pure electron ) drifts across a simulation grid with a speed near the speed of light .",
    "analysis shows that it is due to the unphysical coupling of electromagnetic like modes and wave particle resonances ( including those due to aliasing ) @xcite .",

    "is mainly determined by the maxwell field solver used in the simulation , the location of the unstable nci modes can be manipulated through the choice of the maxwell solver .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was shown that using a spectral maxwell solver , i.e. , solving maxwell s equations in @xmath32-space @xcite , moves the fastest growing modes to a region in @xmath32-space far away from the modes of physical interest . in this case ,",
    "the fastest growing modes all come from the first spatial aliasing beam ( @xmath6 , @xmath33 ) resonance . for a yee solver ,",
    "the fast growing modes come from this resonance , as well as from the fundamental mode ( @xmath5 ) which leads to growth at @xmath32 that resides in the middle of the interesting physics . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the fastest growing nci mode for a spectral solver could be eliminated by applying a low pass filter in the solver .",
    "based on these results the feasibility of using an em - pic code with spectral solver to eliminate the nci for lwfa simulations in a lorentz boosted frame was subsequently investigated in @xcite . for weakly nonlinear laser drivers",
    "the agreement between the rest and lorentz boosted frames was excellent for arbitrary @xmath34 .",
    "for nonlinear cases , the lineouts of the wakefield in fig . 8 in ref .",
    "@xcite showed differences at the highest @xmath34 .",
    "based on these differences , in this paper we have examined further both the growth rates and methods for eliminating lower growing nci unstable modes with an emphasis for the spectral solver .",
    "we note that godfrey and co - workers have proposed methods to reduce the growth rate of the nci for finite difference solvers @xcite .",
    "they have also discussed the nci characters of an fft based analytical time domain solver and concentrate on time steps larger than the courant limit of the spectral maxwell solver @xcite .",
    "the work presented here can be viewed as complementary since there are advantages and disadvantages for each type of solver and for using large or small time steps .    to systematically investigate these additional unstable modes , we rewrite the numerical dispersion relation into the form of two coupled modes whose coupling term vanishes in the continuous limit with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "these two coupled modes can be identified as the numerical form of the lorentz transformation of modes which are purely longitudinal ( plasma oscillations ) and purely transverse ( em waves ) in the rest frame of the plasma .",
    "these modes are uncoupled in the rest frame in the continuous limit . therefore ,",
    "in the continuous limit where lorentz invariance is strictly true they are also decoupled , although no longer remaining purely longitudinal and transverse .",
    "however , we show that in the discrete limit there is a non - vanishing coupling term in the dispersion relation .",
    "the coupling term explicitly shows how the finite grid sizes and time step leads to the inevitable coupling between these modes which leads to instability .",
    "recasting the dispersion relation in this new form not only sheds light on the mechanism of the nci , but also provides a natural way to systematically calculate the unstable nci modes .",
    "we use this dispersion relation to obtain analytical expressions for the family of unstable modes which includes the dependence of growth rate on the grid size , time step , and plasma density ; as well as the location of the modes in @xmath32-space .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the analytical expressions , numerical solutions to the dispersion relation , and pic simulations .",
    "based on these new results , we have experimented with different strategies for eliminating the first , second , and higher order unstable nci modes with an emphasis on the spectral solver . as has been demonstrated in @xcite , when a low pass filter is used the fastest growing nci modes [ at @xmath37 are completely eliminated in the spectral solver .",
    "in addition , we find that for the parameter space of interest the second fastest growing modes are those at @xmath38 .",
    "these modes have a highly localized pattern of four dots in fourier space ( one in each quadrant ) in 2d and two rings in 3d .",
    "since in some cases the unstable modes can reside near or in the middle of modes of physical interest , filtering them out directly could potentially affect the accuracy of the physics model .",
    "however , we find that unlike the fastest growing modes , the location and growth rate of these @xmath38 mode depend on the time step as well as the plasma density . as the time step",
    "is reduced these modes move to higher values of wave number well outside the region of physical interest and their growth rate is greatly reduced .",
    "thus , these modes can be eliminated by reducing the time step .",
    "in addition , we find that by slightly modifying the finite difference operator @xmath39_1 $ ] of the maxwell solver at the region where the @xmath38 modes reside , we can completely eliminate these modes .",
    "we also find that the location , growth rate , and the values of @xmath40 of the next fastest growing modes depend on the time step and particle shape , and reducing the time step can also effectively eliminate these modes as well .",
    "these results reveal clear advantages of spectral em - pic codes : the results always converge as the time step is reduced , which allows one to check the validity of any simulation",
    ".    we then present results from relativistic collisionless shock simulations , as well as lwfa simulations in the nonlinear regime using this new understanding of the location and growth rate of the unstable modes . in all these simulations involving relativistically drifting plasma we used a low - pass filter to eliminate the fastest growing nci modes .",
    "we conducted simulations at time steps near the courant limit , as well as at smaller time steps in which the second fastest growing modes have a smaller growth rate and reside farther away from the physical modes .",
    "we likewise used the method of modifying the em dispersion curve to complete eliminate the @xmath38 modes . comparing the results from these two approaches allow one to identify how the nci and/or time step affect the physics modeling .",
    "more accurate modeling are observed in both shock simulations , and lwfa simulations when the elimination strategies are used . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the results and discuss areas for future work .",

    "we reduce the time step , while in the other we slightly modify the em dispersion curve near the region in @xmath167 space where there is coupling between the em modes and main langmuir mode .",
    "the growth rates of the higher order nci modes with @xmath168 are reduced when using higher order particle shapes and they are also modified as the time step is reduced .",
    "we show that in upic - emma simulations of both lwfa in a lorentz boosted frame and of colliding plasmas ( as is done when simulating relativistic collisionless shocks ) can be carried out with no evidence of the nci . in both cases",
    "the results show that the @xmath77 nci modes are effectively eliminated when a low pass filter is used , and the @xmath38 modes are elimianted when using a reduced time step or applying em dispersion modification in the maxwell solver .    for future work we will investigate the tradeoff in the mitigation strategies discussed in this paper .",
    "when doing a physics simulation signals at all values of @xmath145 occur .",
    "so determining _ a priori _ what time step can be used is difficult .",
    "however , one advantage of the spectral solver is the accuracy of all the physics improves as the time step is reduced , which is not true for finite difference solvers as this can lead to large dispersion errors in em waves .",
    "so once a time step is found for which the results have converged , one can investigate how the results compare with a combination of modified em dispersion and intermediate time step . furthermore ,",
    "studying how the physics changes as the time step is reduced and how results actually converge is also an important area for future work .",
    "determining where the nci will occur in time and space using the predicted growth rates and then mapping this to time and space in the lab frame is another area for future work .",
    "lastly , it will be useful to develop filters and interpolation schemes that theoretically cancel the coupling term , @xmath48 .",
