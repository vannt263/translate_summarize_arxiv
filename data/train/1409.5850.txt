    "in classical electromagnetism , electric ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic ( @xmath1 ) fields induce electric polarization ( @xmath2 ) and magnetization ( @xmath3 ) in matter , respectively , yet using @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) to induce @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , the so - called magnetoelectric effect ( mee ) , is a highly nontrivial issue @xcite .",
    "recently , technological and theoretical progress triggered a renaissance of the mee , especially in multiferroic materials @xcite .",
    "it was expected that the efficient control of magnetism in terms of the electric field would have many potential applications in spintronics and data storage technology .",
    "there are several envisaged explanations for the magnetically induced ferroelectricity . among them , the exchange - striction mechanism @xcite and the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) mechanism @xcite are main streams in accounting for ferroelectricity in inversion symmetry breaking lattices . in the former mechanism ,",
    "the bonds become different between the parallel and the antiparallel spins through exchange striction associated with symmetric superexchange @xmath4 . as a result",
    ", the electric polarization @xmath2 is induced by the crystallographic deformations in the direction of the chain .",
    "such a mechanism was originally introduced to explain the mee in material cr@xmath5o@xmath6 @xcite and was recently applied to other versatile systems @xcite .",
    "besides , for the noncollinear spiral- or helimagnetic order , resulting from antisymmetric magnetic frustration , the term @xmath7 is also a common way to activate the inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "the electric polarization @xmath2 is thereby generated by the displacement of oppositely charged ions as described by tokura and seki @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the unit vector connecting the neighboring spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath12 of the cycloidal component is material - dependent @xcite , and its sign depends on the vector spin chirality .",
    "this microscopic origin towards magnetism - induced ferroelectricity constitutes the well - known inverse dm mechanism . it was proposed that dm interaction induces the helimagnetic spin ground state and ferroelectricity in cu@xmath5oseo@xmath6 @xcite , cycloidal magnetic structure in multiferroic bifeo@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "note , incidentally , that there is a plethora of experimentally accessible compounds where electron spin resonance can be applied as a consequence of the presence of dm interaction @xcite .",
    "the dm - like spin - orbit interaction in a single - crystal yttrium iron garnet was experimentally measured recently @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", a number of theoretical papers was devoted to the effects of dm interaction in magnets @xcite . of interest",
    "are also studies that explore spin superfluidity as a consequence of the non - collinear long - range order and the analogy to josepson effect in superconductors @xcite .",
    "the concept of magnetism - driven ferroelectricity naturally brings significant attention to quantum spin systems . among them",
    ", several spin-1/2 chain materials appear to be the most straightforward but conceptually important models , and have been extensively studied , as for example ca@xmath6comno@xmath13 @xcite , licu@xmath5o@xmath5 @xcite , licuvo@xmath14 @xcite , and cucl@xmath5 @xcite . in a realistic quantum wire ,",
    "the superexchange interaction between spins of transition metal ions depends on the details of crystal structure , such as the bond length between magnetic ions and the angle between the bonds connecting magnetic and ligand ions .",
    "the effect of such variants must be addressed .",
    "so far most literature focuses on heisenberg exchange interaction  such models require approximations and are not easy to solve completely . in order to obtain an unbiased solution we address in this paper the problem of ferroelectricity in the anisotropic exchange model which is exactly solvable .",
    "our model is a generalization of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) compass model where vector chiral correlations are introduced by the additional dm  interaction .",
    "it features rather rich phase diagram that results from the interplay of dm terms , external fields and frustrated compass - type exchange interactions .",
    "we analyze the different symmetry breaking due to magnetic and electric fields .",
    "further we demonstrate in the fermionic representation of the spin model that the gapless topological phase is characterized by four distinct fermi points , in contrast to the conventional gapped phases or symmetry - protected phases with twofold degenerate fermi points .",
    "we identify the nonlocal string order in the chiral phase accompanied by the finite electrical polarization .",
    "in particular we demonstrate the change of the entanglement spectrum between the canted nel phase and the chiral phase .",
    "the 1d compass model is a realization of the directional competing interactions known from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) compass model @xcite on a chain with alternating ising - like interactions between @xmath15 and @xmath16 spin components on neighboring bonds .",
    "similar to the kitaev model @xcite , the 2d and 1d compass model are characterized by intrinsic frustration of interactions .",
    "an exact solution of the 1d compass model shows that the ground state has high degeneracy @xcite , and a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) occurs when anisotropic interactions pass through the isotropic point @xcite .",
    "we have organized the paper into six sections .",
    "first , we introduce the hamiltonian of the 1d generalized compass model ( gcm ) with dm interaction in sec . [",
    "sec : fermions ] , and then present the procedure to solve it exactly by employing jordan - wigner transformation in absence of magnetic field , see sec .",

    "section [ sec : discussion ] contains final discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider a frustrated 1d magnet with dm  interaction , which relates to the magnetostriction and inverse dm ( or spin - current ) mechanisms in a nonstoichiometric structure . to focus attention , we assume that the 1d chain is along @xmath15 axis , i.e. , @xmath17 , so the possible nonzero components of @xmath18 are @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 according to eq .",

    "here @xmath0 is the electric field and @xmath1 is the external magnetic field , which contains the @xmath32-factor @xmath32 and the bohr magneton @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the dm vector and the interaction comes from a relativistic correction to the usual superexchange that has a strength proportional to the spin - orbit coupling constant . without an inversion center on any bond , the antisymmetric exchange is usually by one order of magnitude smaller than the exchange interaction .",
    "an immediate question is to what extent they affect the nonmagnetic phase .",
    "note that the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) interpolates between the 1d ising model ( @xmath35 ) and the 1d compass model ( @xmath36 ) @xcite . at an intermediate value of @xmath37",

    "as soon as a dm interaction is introduced , the hamiltonian is no longer invariant with respect to a space inversion about a bond center .",
    "the dm interaction always induces an electric polarization according to eq .",
    "( [ polarization ] ) that lies within the rotation plane of the spins and is perpendicular to the magnetic bond , and thus competes with the exchange energy .",

    "<S> dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction induces an electrical polarization in the ground state of the chiral phase , where the nonlocal string order and special features of entanglement spectra arise , while strong chiral correlations emerge at finite temperature in the other phases and are controlled by a gap between the nonchiral ground state and the chiral excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the magnetoelectric effects in all phases disappear above a typical temperature corresponding to the total bandwidth of the effective fermionic model . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we explore the entropy , specific heat , magnetization , electric polarization , and the magnetoelectric tensor at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we identify rather peculiar specific heat and polarization behavior of the compass model which follows from highly frustrated interactions . </S>"
