    "recent years have seen the emergence of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) as a new class of radio transient .",
    "frbs are characterized by millisecond durations , @xmath1jansky flux densities , and dispersion measures ( dms ) consistent with sources at gigaparsec ( gpc ) distances .",
    "now observed with a growing number of instruments , including the parkes  @xcite , arecibo  @xcite , and green bank  @xcite telescopes , frbs are becoming increasingly accepted as a true astronomical phenomenon , rather than local signals of terrestrial origin .",
    "recently ,  @xcite have even reported the first identification of an frb s host galaxy , although this claim is currently disputed  @xcite .",
    "frbs also appear to be quite numerous . while only 17 frbs have been reported to date ( @xcite ; see the frbcat ) , after correcting for sky coverage and observing cadence it is estimated that between @xmath2 and @xmath3 occur on the sky per day  @xcite .",
    "that is , a hypothetical telescope array observing continuously with complete sky coverage would observe between 1000 and 10,000 frbs per day .    a large number of theories have been put forward as to the possible source(s ) of frbs . theorized sources include ( but are certainly not limited to ) the collapse of supramassive neutron stars  @xcite , supergiant neutron star pulses  @xcite , pulsar - planet systems  @xcite , bremmstrahlung from gamma - ray bursts or active galactic nuclei  @xcite , and galactic flare stars  @xcite .",
    "more exotic sources include the explosions of white holes  @xcite and primordial black hole evaporation  @xcite .",
    "compact binary coalescences ( cbcs ) represent another broad class of theorized frb progenitor .",
    "the mergers of binary neutron stars ( bns ; @xcite ) , neutron star  black hole ( nsbh ) binaries  @xcite , white dwarf binaries  @xcite , and charged binary black holes ( bbhs ; @xcite ) have all been put forward as possible sources of frb emission .",
    "furthermore , the recent localization of frb150418 to an elliptical galaxy with low star formation would , if correct , support a cbc progenitor  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that binary coalescences are frb progenitors is particularly attractive .",
    "if this were indeed the case , then frbs would be promising electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational - wave detections of compact binary mergers , and would be valuable targets for future multi - messenger studies  @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of the repeating fast radio burst frb 121102  @xcite points to a non - cataclysmic origin for at least some fraction of frbs , ruling out binary coalescences as the sole progenitors of all frbs .",
    "as has been pointed out , though , frbs may not constitute a single population  @xcite ; there may instead exist multiple frb populations , each arising from a different class of progenitor .",
    "if binary coalescences are to be considered plausible models for one such progenitor population , then their astrophysical rates must be consistent with the inferred rate of frbs .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate that existing and future gravitational - wave measurements of the rates of binary coalescences can be leveraged to place novel constraints on the nature of frb progenitors . in some cases , we can confidently rule out certain classes of binary coalescences as dominant frb progenitors .",
    "the recent advanced ligo and virgo detection of the bbh merger gw150914",
    "@xcite has produced the first direct measurement of the binary black hole merger rate per comoving volume ( the so - called `` rate density '' ) in the nearby universe . from this event",
    ", it is inferred that the bbh merger rate density lies between @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "while the rate densities of bns and nsbh mergers remain unknown , binary pulsar observations and population synthesis models place rough bounds on the expected bns and nsbh rates , respectively .",
    "bns and nsbh merger rate densities are predicted to plausibly fall between @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that  @xcite predict nsbh rate densities as low as @xmath8 .",
    "gravitational - wave experiments have not yet begun to probe these predicted ranges ; the best experimental results , placed by jointly by initial ligo and initial virgo , limit bns and nsbh merger rate densities to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "although the initial ligo / virgo limits are well above the most optimistic predictions from population synthesis and binary pulsars , advanced ligo s recently concluded first observing run ( o1 ) is expected to measure rate densities down to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , experimentally probing for the first time the range of astrophysically plausible merger rates  @xcite . in 2017 - 18 , advanced ligo s second observing run ( o2 ) is projected to be sensitive to rate densities as low as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while the its third run ( o3 ; 2018 - 19 ) further pushes advanced ligo s sensitivity to @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the predicted and measured rates of binary coalescences allow for direct constraints on the nature of frb progenitors by comparison to the inferred frb rate per comoving volume .",
    "other authors have considered the physical rate of frbs , but these calculations are typically not shown in detail and significant disagreement exists in the literature , e.g.  @xcite vs.  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this section is therefore a careful accounting of the frb rate density . as we will show below",
    ", the frb rate per comoving volume is potentially far higher than the corresponding rate densities of binary coalescences .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the coalescence of stellar - mass compact binaries represents more than a small fraction of frb progenitors . because of this rate discrepancy , the _ lowest _ frb rate estimates are _ most compatible _ with cbc progenitors . in the following",
    ", we will therefore deliberately seek a lower limit on the frb rate density in order to most generously assess the plausibility of cbc progenitors of frbs .    the inferred frb rate per comoving volume is approximately @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the comoving distance containing the observed frb population and @xmath19 is the observed rate at which frbs occur on the sky . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume this rate density is constant and neglect evolution with redshift .",
    "if frb emission is _ beamed _ , then the rate @xmath19 is undercounted due to selection effects  beamed frbs , like pulsars or grbs , are only observed if the earth lies within the path of the beam . in general , the frb rate per comoving volume is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a typical solid angle over which emission is beamed .    although few frbs have been observed , their inferred rate on the sky is large . with four frb detections at high galactic latitudes using parkes",
    ", @xcite inferred that @xmath22 frbs occur on the sky per day .",
    "however , there remains considerable disagreement as to the true value of @xmath19 , with subsequent radio surveys producing differing rate estimates , often defined with respect to different fluence limits and different assumptions about search systematics .",
    "@xcite , for instance , point out that frb detection is subject to significant selection effects , such as survey incompleteness below a fluence of @xmath23 , suboptimal recovery of broad radio pulses , and potential obscuration of frbs in the galactic plane .",
    "they estimate a fluence - limited detectable frb rate of @xmath24 above @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite also arrive at @xmath26 but by different means , suggesting that the apparent frb rate at high latitudes is enhanced by interstellar scintillation .",
    "@xcite adopt a bayesian approach , combining several published rate estimates to obtain @xmath27 above @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite argue that previously published single - dish rate estimates are biased below their true values and that , once potential biases are corrected , previous estimates are consistent with @xmath29 above @xmath30 .",
    "it is not obvious which value to select for @xmath19 ( or even which range of uncertainties to adopt ) . in order to place a lower limit on the frb rate density , however , we will take @xmath31 , consistent with the lowest of the above estimates . to additionally allow for various search selection effects",
    ", we will define @xmath32 as the frb detection efficiency , the fraction of otherwise detectable frbs ( e.g. with intrinsic signal - to - noise ratios above some threshold detection value ) which are actually recovered in a radio transient search .",
    "the physical rate of frbs on the sky is then @xmath33 .     as a fiducial distance bounding the observed frb population . ]",
    "distances to frb sources may be estimated using their reported dms , which we obtained from the frbcat  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is homogeneous and fully ionized , the dispersion measure @xmath34 due to propagation through the igm is related to source redshift via  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the local free electron density in a fully ionized universe .",
    "here , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the energy densities of baryons , matter , and dark energy , respectively , @xmath40 is the proton mass , and @xmath41 is the critical energy density required to close the universe .",
    "@xmath42 is newton s constant , @xmath43 the speed of light , and @xmath44 the hubble constant ; we use the @xcite parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . in the small redshift limit ,",
    ".   reduces to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the approximate source distance at low redshifts . in general , comoving distance is given by @xmath51 using eqs .",
    "and , the inferred comoving distances to the 17 known frbs are shown in fig .",
    "[ distplot ] . based on this sample",
    ", we will take @xmath52 as a fiducial distance encompassing the observed frb population .",
    "we have made several assumptions in computing the distances shown in fig .",
    "[ distplot ] . since",
    "a factor of @xmath4 error in the fiducial distance will result in a factor of @xmath53 error in the frb rate density , it is important to highlight these assumptions and understand how they affect our result .",
    "first , we assumed that the observed radio dispersions are entirely due to propagation through the igm . in reality",
    ", the milky way may contribute up to @xmath54 of the observed dm  @xcite .",
    "the distances in fig .",
    "[ distplot ] may therefore be overestimated by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "if we also allow for a comparable dm contribution by the frb s host galaxy ( as well contributions from any matter overdensities along the line of sight to the frb ) , then the distances may be overestimated by at least a factor of @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that our frb rate density is _ underestimated _ by a factor between @xmath4 and @xmath57 .",
    "second , we assumed a fully ionized universe . while valid for hydrogen , this is not necessarily true for helium , which may be either singly or fully ionized .",
    "helium makes up approximately @xmath58 of the igm by mass  @xcite ; if this helium is only singly ionized , then the free electron density @xmath59 will be reduced by roughly @xmath60 .",
    "finally , @xmath37 is an overestimate of the baryon density in the igm , since @xmath61 of baryons are sequestered in galaxies  @xcite .",
    "together , these two approximations cause @xmath59 to be ( at most ) @xmath62 larger than the true free electron density in the igm . by overestimating @xmath59 ,",
    "the fiducial distance @xmath18 is underestimated by a factor of @xmath63 , and the frb rate density is overestimated by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "note that , of the assumptions described here , the first ( uncertainty in the intergalactic dm ) will cause the fiducial distance to be underestimated , while the second and third ( uncertainty in @xmath59 ) cause the distance to be overestimated . of these uncertainties ,",
    "the potentially large overestimate of the intergalactic dm is expected to dominate .",
    "thus our choice of @xmath64 is likely an upper bound on the fiducial frb distance . because @xmath65 , any decrease in the fiducial distance will only increase the frb rate density , further increasing the tension between the rates of frbs and binary coalescences .",
    "all together , the frb rate per comoving volume is @xmath66 the lowest plausible frb rate density , corresponding to @xmath67 , radio transient detection efficiencies of @xmath68 , and _ isotropic _ radio emission ( @xmath69 ) , is @xmath70 a more realistic rate density , on the other hand , is obtained by assuming @xmath71 , a detection efficiency of @xmath72 , and beamed emission with a @xmath73 half - opening angle .",
    "these values give @xmath74 nearly two orders of magnitude larger than eq .  .",
    "our lower limit on the frb rate density agrees well with the rate previously estimated by  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , more than an order of magnitude higher than the more recent result computed by  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy lies in the fact that  @xcite improperly uses the luminosity distance @xmath75 rather than the comoving distance to calculate the frb rate density .",
    "@xcite chooses @xmath76 as a fiducial redshift , at which @xmath77 while @xmath78 .",
    "this factor of @xmath4 adjustment in distance leads to a factor of @xmath79 discrepancy in the frb rate density . using @xmath80 in eq .",
    "( 8) of  @xcite gives an frb rate density of @xmath81 , in reasonably good agreement with our lower limit .",
    "by comparing @xmath82 from sect .",
    "[ frbratessection ] to the binary coalescence rates in sect .",

    "_ binary black holes : _ the measured rate of binary black holes mergers is _ at most _",
    "@xmath85 of the inferred frb rate .",
    "thus , bbhs can not explain more than a small fraction of the observed frb population .",
    "previous claims that the rates of frbs and bbh mergers are consistent  @xcite are based on an erroneous calculation of the frb rate density , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ frbratessection ] .",
    "_ neutron star - black hole binaries : _ population synthesis predictions are highly inconsistent with the theory that nsbh mergers are frb progenitors , with predicted nsbh merger rates equal to at most @xmath86 of the frb rate .",
    "this fraction assumes isotropic radio emission , and hence should be taken as a highly optimistic upper limit on the frb fraction compatible with nsbh binaries .",
    "even moderate beaming , with a half - opening angle of e.g. @xmath73 , reduces the predicted frb fraction to @xmath87 . assuming the realistic frb rate density in eq .",
    "further lowers this fraction by a factor of four .",
    "although initial ligo / virgo upper limits are uninformative ( limiting the most optimistic nsbh fraction of frb progenitors to @xmath88 ) , advanced ligo is capable of measuring significantly smaller nsbh merger rates .",
    "a non - detection during the o1 and o2 observing runs , for instance , would limit the nsbh frb fraction to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ( assuming isotropic emission ) .    _",
    "binary neutron stars : _ there exist competing claims as to whether the rates of frbs and binary neutron star mergers are  @xcite or are not  @xcite compatible . we find that the most optimistic bns rate density predictions are consistent with the lowest possible frb rate density , with @xmath91 therefore , bns mergers could constitute a subpopulation of frb progenitor if multiple frb subclasses do indeed exist .",
    "this compatibility is tenuous , however , simultaneously requiring the highest possible bns rates and the lowest possible frb rates ( with , e.g. , perfect frb detection efficiency and isotropic radio emission ) .",
    "frb models that predict even moderately beamed emission are largely incompatible with bns progenitors .",
    "if bns mergers are indeed frb progenitors , then it is likely that advanced ligo will observe a large number of bns sources in the o1 observing run .",
    "if no such detections are made , then the resulting rate limits will increasingly cast doubt on the role of bnss as frb progenitors .",
    "an advanced ligo non - detection during o1 and o2 would limit the most optimistic fraction of frbs compatible with bns mergers to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . if we assume moderate frb beaming ( again with a half - opening angle of @xmath73 ) , then o1 and o2 non - detections imply even more stringent frb fractions of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "note that these limits also apply equally to short - lived products of bns mergers , such as hypermassive neutron stars .",
    "a diverse range of frb progenitor models have been proposed , including the binary coalescences of neutron stars and/or black holes .",
    "existing or future limits from gravitational - wave observations can serve to severely constrain such models .",
    "the recent advanced ligo / virgo measurement of the local bbh merger rate density largely rules out stellar - mass binary black holes as progenitors of the observed frb population .",
    "meanwhile , predictions of nsbh merger rate densities from population synthesis are in strong tension with the inferred rate density of frbs ; upcoming observations by advanced ligo and virgo could rule out nsbhs as frb progenitors .    under generous assumptions ( broadly beamed radio emission , large frb distances , and low underlying frb rates ) ,",
    "the rate of bns mergers may be consistent with a subpopulation of frb progenitors . in order for this subpopulation to be significant",
    ", however , the bns merger rate density must be on the order of @xmath96 , comparable to the most optimistic predictions from population synthesis .",
    "additionally , frb emission must be largely isotropic ; models that predict even moderately beamed emission are inconsistent with bns rates .",
    "if bns mergers are indeed frb progenitors , then advanced ligo and virgo will soon begin to observe a large number of such systems .",
    "if no such observations are made , then the resulting rate limits will increasingly constrain the ability of bnss to explain even a subclass of the frb population .",
