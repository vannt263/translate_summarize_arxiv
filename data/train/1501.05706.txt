    "in general , the emission originating in the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona as well as from the corona itself is optically thin for emission lines observed on the sun .",
    "mostly , the low density of the plasma in the upper atmosphere allows each emitted photon to escape without further scattering .",
    "there are some exceptions , though .",
    "in particular , strong resonance lines have been reported to show effects of optical depth through the analysis of line ratios .",
    "the resonance lines of li - like ions , e.g. c at 1548  and 1550 , should have a line ratio of about 2 under optically thin conditions ( according to their einstein @xmath0 coefficients ) .",
    "however , when observed towards the limb of the sun , implying a longer line - of - sight , an increased non - thermal width and a reduced line ratio indicate that optical depth effects become ( marginally ) important @xcite .",
    "despite this indirect evidence , no self - absorption features have been found in lines forming in the transition region or at higher temperatures .",
    "if such self - absorption features could be found , they would give important information on the structure of the solar atmosphere .",
    "this is in analogy to the arguments based on the absence of absorption lines in the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) originating from the chromosphere .",
    "while dynamic models of the photosphere and chromosphere @xcite overall reproduce the details of observed chromospheric spectra , they have been criticized because the average background atmosphere with a monotonic decreasing temperature should produce euv absorption lines @xcite .",
    "concerning the transition region emission , the existence or absence of self - absorption features is of interest to understand the thermal structure of the atmosphere along the line of sight .",
    "traditionally , the transition region was considered as a thin layer separating the chromosphere and the corona .",
    "however , recent observation of pockets of hot gas in the cool chromosphere questioned this paradigm @xcite , and the observation of so far unreported self - absorption features could hold the key to better understand the deviation of the realistic transition region from our traditional knowledge .",
    "a whole zoo of phenomena have been identified on the sun that show themselves through peculiarities of transition region emission lines in the euv , either by enhanced emission , changes in the spectral profiles , or both . among them",
    "are explosive events @xcite , blinkers @xcite , and the recently found ellerman - bomb - type events @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of these events is not yet fully clear .",
    "the common feature is that all these events , just as the traditional ellerman bombs @xcite , are thought to be the response to a reconnection event .",
    "should this be the case , the main reason for the quite different appearance in euv and visible light might be mainly due to the exact location of the reconnection site .",
    "if it is located very deep in the atmosphere , it will be visible only in emission from the chromosphere , e.g. , h@xmath1 , as traditional ellerman bombs @xcite .",
    "on the other end of the scale , if the reconnection happens higher up , it will be visible as an explosive event , mostly in transition region lines , with only a small counterpart in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "here we present observations from the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that share spectral features with previous euv brightenings , but for the first time show a self - absorption feature in a transition region line .",
    "the event we concentrate on in this study was observed by iris from 09:20 ut to 09:26 ut on 2013 december 6 , and showed a peculiar self - absorption feature in si . during this campaign",
    ", iris was observing an emerging active region in sit - and - stare mode with an exposure time of 4  s. the spatial sampling of the spectrograph ( along the @xmath2 wide slit ) is @xmath3 per pixel . in the spectral direction",
    "an on - board two - pixel binning was applied leading to a spectral sampling of 26  m  per pixel , corresponding to about 5.5kms@xmath4 per pixel in doppler units . considering the spectral resolution of about 30m  in the fuv @xcite , in our dataset the spectral resolution is governed solely by the spectral sampling .",
    "the main emphasis is on the analysis of the profiles of euv emission lines from the transition region , in particular of the two resonance lines of si at 1393.76  and 1402.77 , the c lines at 1334.54  and 1335.71 , and the forbidden lines of o at 1399.78  and 1401.16 . besides this",
    ", we also investigated the iris slit - jaw images in the 1400    band .",
    "this shows a mixture of emission from the chromosphere ( lyman continuum of si ) and the transition region ( si lines ) .",
    "these slit - jaw images were taken with an exposure time of 4  s and a cadence of  16  s. their spatial sampling is @xmath3 per pixel .",
    "we use the iris level  2 data which are publicly available at http://iris.lmsal.com .    to investigate the signatures of this event at different temperatures we also examined images taken by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory .",
    "their spatial sampling is @xmath5 per pixel .",
    "observations in the ultraviolet ( uv ) passbands ( 1600  and 1700 ) have a cadence of  24  s , while the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) observations ( 304 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , 131 , and 94 ) have a cadence of 12  s. we use the longitudinal magnetograms obtained by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to study the evolution of the corresponding magnetic field .",
    "these magnetograms have a spatial sampling of @xmath6 per pixel and a cadence of 45  s.    we align the iris spectra and slit - jaw images using the fiducial marks crossing the slit .",
    "the aia 1600  images are used to achieve a coalignment between the iris and aia data .",
    "the hmi images are aligned to aia 1600  images using a cross - correlation technique .",
    "the 1400   slit - jaw images show a bright point appearing just to the left of the iris slit at 09:20:25  ut .",
    "it grew and extended all the way to the right side of the slit around 09:22:13  ut ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) and disappeared around 09:24:02 .",
    "these slit - jaw images show that the iris slit was placed across this brightening event so that the euv spectra will show ( part of ) its evolution . for context , the aia 193   image showing the coronal 1.5mk plasma and the ( longitudinal ) magnetic field of the whole active region are displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] , too .",
    "the event can also be identified with in aia 1600   images , with an elliptical shape similar to the iris 1400  images .",
    "however , the event is not seen in the 1700  images , suggesting that the response in 1600   is due to the emission of civ at 1548  and 1550  rather than due the uv continuum .    during the event ,",
    "the intensity of siiv increases roughly by a factor of 20 compared to the average emission before , which is consistent with the 1600  channel being dominated by civ .",
    "this also implies that the 1400  channel is dominated by emission from about 0.1mk hot plasma , too , in this case .",
    "the maximum response of 171   channel of aia ( @xmath7 dncms@xmath8s@xmath4pix@xmath4 at just below 10@xmath9k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath10 times higher than at the formation temperature of siiv , so if the plasma in the current event is heated only to some 10@xmath11k , no counterpart in the aia 171   channel , or channels showing even hotter plasma is expected . observing no signature of the event in 171  or 193",
    "( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) is consistent with the event not producing any plasma of 1mk or hotter ( at least not in significant abundance ) .",
    "inspection of the hmi  magnetogram in figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the event occurred in a mixed - polarity region .",
    "we find no obvious change of the magnetic flux magnitude directly at the site of the event .",
    "however , the flux of the negative polarity to the upper right of the event ( x : @xmath12 , y : @xmath13 , see red box in figure  [ fig1]f ) shows a significant decrease .",
    "this might be related to flux cancellation , and depending on the magnetic structure , this flux cancellation might be directly connected to the event we observe .      during the event ,",
    "the line profiles of the siiv lines and the cii lines become very broad due to the strong enhancement in the red and blue wings ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a similar but less strong enhancement is also present in the mgii lines at 2796.347    and 2803.523  .",
    "this indicates that the event is covering also the uppermost tip of the chromosphere .",
    "in contrast , no significant enhancement is found in the oiv 1400  and 1401  forming just below 0.2mk .",
    "this underlines that the event does not reach coronal temperatures and might be limited to temperatures below @xmath14mk .",
    "in contrast to the bombs studied by @xcite , here the forbidden o 1401  line is visible throughout the whole brightening ( cf .",
    "middle row of figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the line profiles of the siiv lines show a spectral tilt ( figure  [ fig1]g ) : the profiles have dominant red wings in the southern part of the brightening ( y = @xmath15 ) , they become roughly symmetric in the middle of the brightening ( y = @xmath16 ) and finally show dominant blue wings in the northern part ( y = @xmath17 ) .",
    "these type of spectra are well known and are typically associated with twisting @xcite or rotation of the plasma in helical structures @xcite .",
    "the cii and mgii line profiles also show a similar feature .",
    "the strong enhancement of the line and the wings is very clear in the profiles shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . during the peak time of the brightening ,",
    "the line profile shows extended wings reaching out to doppler shifts of more than 200kms@xmath4 in the blue and red . moreover , there is a clearly distinguishable component redshifted by @xmath18250kms@xmath4 in the phase of highest si emission ( light blue profile ; fig.[fig2 ] , top and middle row ) .",
    "this and the clear excess of emission in the wings throughout the event suggests the presence of non - resolved plasma flows with a wide range of velocities reaching speeds ( along the line of sight ) in excess of 200kms@xmath4 in these events . these speeds are highly supersonic and will be comparable or even higher than the alfvn speed ( depending on the assumptions for the magnetic field and density at the location of the event ) .",
    "such high velocity components have not been observed in the spectra of explosive events or blinkers that have been mostly observed in quiet sun network areas , and they are even higher than the speeds found in ellerman - bomb - type events recently found in siiv @xcite .",
    "this underlines that the event we deal with here is a violent disruption of the upper chromosphere and transition region .",
    "embedded in the emission line profiles of siiv and cii clear signatures of chromospheric absorption lines are present during the strong brightening .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig2 ] , where the rest wavelength of several lines of niii ( 1335.203  , 1393.33  ) and feii ( 1392.817  , feii 1393.589  ) are indicated .",
    "these chromospheric absorption lines in the emission line profiles of a transition region line have been first detected by @xcite .",
    "a gaussian fit to the niii absorption feature in the siiv 1394  line gives a full width at half maximum ( ) of about 11kms@xmath4 ( see sample spectrum in figure[fig3]a ) , which corresponds to two ( binned ) pixels in the spatial direction ( cf .",
    "sect.[s : obs ] ) .",
    "the thermal width of niii would be well below 5 kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus the width of the narrow chromospheric absorption features will be mainly determined by the instrument .",
    "this is consistent with the niii absorption features forming in a cool layer _ above _ the hotter formation region of siiv .",
    "because the data set investigated by @xcite was a raster map , they could not study the temporal evolution of the chromospheric lines . here",
    "we see that at no time during the evolution of the event these chromospheric lines appear in emission ( see in particular the top left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "only when the siiv and cii lines get strong enough in their wings while brightening and broadening , these chromospheric lines show themselves in absorption .",
    "this result will be of interest when investigating new models of these events , because they contain information on the timing of the event that might be crucial to distinguish between different model scenarios .",
    "for example , @xcite interpreted the absorption spectra as being due to a ( shallow ) layer of chromospheric material that exists above a reconnection site in the lower chromosphere where si originates .",
    "the fact that the chromospheric lines are not seen in emission , but in absorption might be an indication that the above - lying shallow chromospheric layer might be unaffected by the reconnection event .",
    "however , detailed modeling including radiative transfer will be needed to draw conclusions on this .",
    "the niii 1393.33    line has been observed in bursty explosive events .",
    "in contrast to our observation and to @xcite , there the line was always seen in emission . that niii is seen in emission",
    "may be understood if the explosive event occurs in the upper chromosphere , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "they proposed that implosive bursty transition region explosive events could occur only under two necessary conditions , the modulation of p - mode oscillations and that the reconnection site is located in the upper chromosphere .",
    "the event we study here , however , is in all probability occurring at lower heights .",
    "we can estimate the electron density @xmath19 through the intensity ratio of siiv 1403    and oiv 1401   @xcite , and find @xmath20 $ ] to be about 12.2 to 12.5 ( under the assumption of ionization equilibrium ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , in our observation both oiv lines at 1400   and 1401  are present , so that we can also use these two forbidden lines for density diagnostics and find @xmath20 $ ] to be about 11 . from this",
    "we conclude that the electron density in the source region of our event is in the range of @xmath21@xmath22 to @xmath23@xmath22 , which are chromospheric densities .",
    "this result , together with the presence of the absorption lines of niii and feii , suggests that our event probably occurs in the middle chromosphere .",
    "this might suggest that one of the main differences between an explosive event and the event we report here or the ellerman - bomb - type events by @xcite might just be the height in the atmosphere where the reconnection occurs .",
    "the most peculiar spectral feature in the event we investigate here is the clear presence of self - absorption in a transition region line that has not been reported before .",
    "this feature is seen at both siiv lines at 1394  and 1403 .    in the evolution of the line profiles of both siiv lines in figure[fig2 ] near the rest wavelength of the respective siiv line ( indicated by the short vertical lines ) a narrow absorption feature appears .",
    "the dips reach a depth of up to 1/3 ( sometimes even 1/2 ) of the peak emission ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) . a gaussian fit to these dips",
    "gives a width of about 17kms@xmath4 ( ; cf .",
    "figure[fig3]a ) , which is clearly resolved by the iris spectrometer and significantly broader than the chromospheric absorption lines discussed in sect.[s : abs.lines ] .",
    "also molecular absorption lines would not be resolved by iris because they form at very cool temperatures only , and thus would show line widths comparable to the chromopsheric absorption features in our data set .",
    "this indicates that the absorption features near the siiv rest wavelength are not due to chromospheric or molecular lines .",
    "furthermore a search of lines lists did not reveal obvious potential chromospheric lines that could lead to these absorption features at the rest wavelengths of siiv .",
    "if the absorption would be due to molecules one would expect not only one line , but a whole band of lines as reported by .",
    "also the simple fact that in both lines the absorption feature appears at the rest wavelength of siiv ( within the errors ) indicates that this is an absorption feature related to siiv itself .",
    "the narrow dip in the profile of siiv at its rest wavelength is also _ not _ due to a bi - directional or multi - component flow .",
    "if that would be the case , then one would expect the line profile to be composed of two or more gaussians at different doppler shifts representing the different flow components . to mimic the dip as observed here with a width of about 17 km / s and a depth of 1/3 of the peak emission ,",
    "one has to add two gaussians with a of 27kms@xmath4 separated by 35kms@xmath4 in wavelength . however",
    ", this composite profile would have a of only 60kms@xmath4 , while the observed profiles have a of 150kms@xmath4 to 300kms@xmath4 . if one would assume two gaussians wide enough to match these large line widths",
    ", then also the central dip would be very broad , in contrast to observations .",
    "the only option would be to assume that the profile is composed by a range of individual narrow gaussians with doppler shifts distributed from some @xmath24kms@xmath4 to some @xmath25kms@xmath4 with no components just at zero doppler shift  which is quite unlikely , in particular because this very special line - of - sight arrangement would have to be found in many cases .",
    "most important , the dips in the siiv lines at 1394  and 1403  show different depths , which is not expected if the dip would come about by a composition of flows under optically thin conditions .",
    "thus one can safely exclude the possibility that the dip at the rest wavelength of si is caused by a bi- or multi - directional flow .",
    "thus one ends up with the most likely conclusion that the features seen at the rest wavelength at both siiv lines have to be due to self - absorption .",
    "major support for this interpretation is given by the ratio of the two siiv lines at 1394  and 1403 .",
    "under optically thin conditions their line ratio should equal the ratio of the oscillator strength , which is about 2 for these li - like resonance lines ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during our event",
    "we see a decrease of the siiv ratio from about 2 to approximately 1.7 .",
    "after the event the ratio is about 2 again , showing that opacity effects become important during the brightening . because the peak count rates are 1000 and higher ( for the 1394  line , cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , the uncertainty is of the order of a few percent .",
    "the uncertainty for the integrated line intensity is even smaller , and we estimate the relative error for the line ratio to be some 3% .",
    "this underlines that the variation of the line ratio we see is significant .",
    "the opacity effects should be more obvious in the stronger of the two siiv lines , i.e. the one at 1394 .",
    "this is indeed found in our data , where the dip at the rest wavelength is always stronger in the 1394  line ( figure[fig2 ] , top row ) than in the 1403  line ( figure[fig2 ] , middle row ) .",
    "even though we concentrate on one event only in this study , this self - absorption feature is not a singular phenomenon .",
    "just to show that this occurs more frequently , we show another example in figure  [ fig3]c .",
    "this sample spectrum is taken in the same active region , just a bit further south ( c.  figure[fig3]b ) .",
    "why have these chromospheric absorption lines and the siiv self - absorption not been observed with previous instruments ?",
    "in particular , could these absorption features have been observed with sumer ? before iris , sumer @xcite and hrts @xcite were the instruments with the best spectral and spatial resolution for euv spectroscopy , roughly equal in performance . to answer the above question , we perform a simple experiment degrading the iris spectra to sumer characteristics and check for the presence of ( self-)absorption features .",
    "the exposure times of sumer and iris are comparable for dynamics studies , e.g. ,  the explosive event study by @xcite used 5s exposures , while here we have 4s exposures . however , the spatial resolution ( and the sampling ) of iris is better by about a factor of almost six ; the spatial sampling of iris being 0.167@xmath26/pixel along the slit , and for sumer only 1@xmath26/pixel .",
    "likewise the spectral resolution of iris is better by about a factor of three . in the following",
    "we adopt the widths for the instrumental spectral profile ( ) of 31.8  m  for iris @xcite and 85.8  m  for sumer @xcite .    to simulate a sumer spectrum from iris data , we take six adjacent iris profiles to account for the difference in spatial sampling , deconvolve the spectra for the instrumental broadening , add them up to give one sumer spatial pixel and convolve the resulting profile with the sumer instrumental spectral profile .",
    "this would mimic an observation with the sumer 0.3@xmath26 slit , roughly matching the 0.35@xmath26 wide iris slit .",
    "the iris profiles of siiv 1394  at six adjacent spatial pixels during the event showing ( self- ) absorption are shown in figure  [ fig4]atof . because the event is compact ( smaller than 1@xmath26 ) not all the profiles show the absorbtion features .",
    "for the spectral deconvolution we use a maximum entropy code.chae/idl/idl.html ] the average of the six iris profiles without and with deconvolution are shown in panels g and h of figure[fig4 ] .",
    "they appear to be quite similar .",
    "the final spectrum convolved with the sumer  spectral profile and rebinned to the sumer spectral sampling is shown in figure[fig4]i .",
    "this can be considered as the profile sumer would have observed from this event .    from this experiment",
    "it is clear that sumer would not have been capable to observe the chromospheric absorption or the siiv self - absorption .",
    "this is not only because of the spatial resolution , but mainly because of the limited spectral resolution . in a more real situation",
    "the small features still visible at the location of the ( self-)absorption in figure[fig4]i would not have been visible with sumer .",
    "typically , for dynamic studies the 1@xmath26 slit would have been used slit was used with sumer mainly for observations in very bright lines , e.g. ly-@xmath1 , to keep the count rates at an acceptable level . ] , so that one would have to deteriorate the spatial sampling by another factor three .",
    "this would then further smooth the line profile to be observed with sumer , because the feature is smaller than 1@xmath26 . because our iris observations were acquired in a sit - and - stare mode",
    ", we do not have a raster map available and can not take this experiment that far .",
    "still we can expect that the weak remnants of the absorption and self - absorption features would be further diminished and likely would be completely absent in real sumer observations .",
    "in recent observations the tilt of spectral lines has been attributed to torsional or rotaional motions .",
    "however , the velocities we observe here are exceeding 100kms@xmath4 , sometimes up to 250kms@xmath4 , hence significantly larger than reported before . that these velocities get close to or",
    "even exceed the the alfvn speed questions the interpretation for a torsional motion in our event .",
    "instead it suggests that this outflow has the nature of a bidirectional jet .",
    "this is the traditional interpretation for transition region explosive events in the quiet sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also for the recently reported ellerman - bomb - type events in transition region lines @xcite .",
    "thus we assume that at the basis of the event we report here , some reconnection is causing strong reconnection outflows which causes the strong brightening and broadening of the si profile .",
    "the interpretation of the event reported here is based on the presence of chromospheric absorption lines and self - absorption features in transition region lines .",
    "we showed that such ( self-)absorption features were not observable with previous euv  spectrographs because of instrumental limitations , in particular in terms of spectral resolution .    in figure[fig5",
    "] we give a cartoon summary of a possible scenario . at a height where in an equilibrium model",
    "the middle chromosphere would be located , a reconnection event gives rise the increase in intensity of si through heating of the previously cool chromospheric plasma . at the same time",
    "the multiple flows created by the reconnection cause a very strong broadening ( panel 1 of figure[fig5 ] ) .    above the location of the heating and the origin of the strong si emission",
    "the pre - existing upper atmosphere is still present",
    ". the thin chromospheric layer above will give rise to the absorption lines of niii and feii ( panel 2 of figure[fig5 ] ) .",
    "actually , the chromospheric absorption features and the high density derived from line ratios are the main arguments to place the origin of the strong si emission in the middle chromosphere in the first place .",
    "this chain of argument is following @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we also find self - absorption features in the si lines .",
    "we see two possible interpretations for this .",
    "one option is that the ( pre - existing ) upper atmosphere above the event contains a sufficient amount of si to cause the self - absorption ( panel 3 of figure[fig5 ] ) .",
    "this is supported by the 1400  slit - jaw - images that show an indication of loops crossing the location on the slit at the location the event is observed ( cf .",
    "figure[fig3]b ) . that is the case for the main event studied here , but",
    "even more so for the second case we briefly mention ( cf . bottom red box in figure[fig3]b and profile in figure[fig3]c ) . in the compact brightening events reported by @xcite",
    "no clear self - reversal can be identified from the siiv line profiles . in their case",
    "no obvious siiv loop structures are visible above the brightening event , which would be consistent with this interpretation .",
    "alternatively , the si self - absorbtion could also arise within the source region of the si brightening event itself , at the height of the middle chromosphere .",
    "the decreased ratio of the si resonance lines ( from about 2 for optically thin to * @xmath27 * ) speaks in favour of this interpretation .",
    "the spectra reported by @xcite showed no self - absorption and had a ratio of the si lines always being close to 2 . for a definite conclusion on the origin of the self - absorption feature of si further studies",
    "are needed , observational investigations as well as considerations including radiative transfer .    the seemingly common physical cause of quite different phenomena ,",
    "e.g. explosive events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ellerman - bombs and related features @xcite and the event we report here , gives rise to an interesting question : what is the real difference between these events . could it be that the magnetic changes underlying these phenomena are similar , and that only the location of the energy deposition determines the different observational consequences ?",
    "extended studies incorporating iris and other instruments might bring us closer to the answer of this intriguing question ."
