    "the transmission spectra , calculated to the first order , or within the linear response theory of the amplitude for the probe field , assumes the initial state of atoms to remain unchanged when expectation values are taken and carries unambiguous signatures of magnetic orders in an atomic bose - hubbard model .",

    "in addition to the usual even filling phase with @xmath52 , a particularly interesting phase arises when the total filling factor is odd , especially at unit filling , i.e. , for @xmath53 . this exotic phase has been extensively studied duan , kuklov , isacsson , altmannjp by adopting a trial wave function @xmath54 , which is of a form composed of two sublattices @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
