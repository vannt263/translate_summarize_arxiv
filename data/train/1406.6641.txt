    "in microelectronics , single failure events sporadically occur which , in some areas , like plane and space navigation , could have catastrophic consequences .",
    "preliminary estimations @xcite and more recent experiments @xcite indicate a correlation between these events and the background neutron radiation ( bnr ) @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of failure is the collision of a neutron from the bnr with an atomic nucleus in the chip , leading to a shower of electrons and ions that locally changes the conductivity and shortcuts the device .    in the present paper ,",
    "we suggest the bnr as a cause of genetic `` fails '' in living cells , that is one of the possible origins of the so called spontaneous mutations .",
    "cells exposed to the shower of electrons and ions , caused by the collision of a neutron and a proton of water , could be anihilated or experience a permanent damage , in particular , a damage in the dna .",
    "the frequency of such events is similar to the rate of appearance of mutations with damage in the dna repair mechanism @xcite , as measured in the long term evolution experiment ( ltee ) , where e. coli populations evolve under controlled conditions @xcite .",
    "the ltee is an experiment conduced by prof .",
    "r. lenski and his group at the michigan state university @xcite .",
    "each day , the bacteria undergo 6 - 7 generations of binary evolution . in a year , around 3400 generations occur .",
    "this means that , since the experiment started in 1988 , it passed 60000 generations .    in the experiment",
    ", 12 populations of bacteria , with a common ancestor , independently evolve .",
    "every day , 0.1 ml of the bacterial culture is serially transferred to 9.9 ml of a glucose solution , and mantained under controlled temperature until the next day .",
    "the number of bacteria varies approximately as shown in fig .",
    "that is , grows according to the law @xmath0 in the first 8h , until the glucose is depleted , and then reach a stationary state . in the last 16h",
    "there is no appreciable mortality .",
    "the dependence @xmath1 is due to the way of reproduction , by cellular division .",
    "the experiment shows a set of very interesting results @xcite .",
    "we shall stress only two of them .",
    "first , in a given population , the total number of single point mutations in the dna , after 20000 generations of evolution , is estimated as @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the rate of point mutuations is :    @xmath3    on the other hand , in 2 of the 12 cultures , after 2500 - 3000 generations , mutations with a damaged dna repair and edit mechanism appeared and became numerically dominant .",
    "a third line evolved the mutator phenotype after 8500 generations , and a fourth after 15000 generations . according to prof .",
    "lenski , the mechanism through which the mutator becomes numerically dominant is roughly the following .",
    "once the mutation appears , the rate of spontaneous mutations increases 100 times , as compared with cells in which the dna repair mechanism is not damaged .",
    "thus , the mutator has a higher chance to generate the next winner and become dominant in a relatively short time scale , around 250 generations .    a second aspect , stressed by prof .",
    "lenski , is that mutations in which the dna repair mechanism is damaged are `` deleterious '' , in the sense that a segment of the dna is removed .",
    "with regard to the bnr , we may assume that the cells live in pure water . indeed , water is the main component of the solution , and the ph should be close to 7 in order to preserve life @xcite . in these conditions ,",
    "the important processes are the collisions between neutrons , from the bnr , and the hydrogen nuclei ( protons ) of water .",
    "the ejected proton gives rise to a shower of ions and electrons that is extended approximately 0.1 mm along the proton trajectory .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the flux per unit energy of neutrons in the bnr @xcite , @xmath4 , in units of neutrons/(mev s @xmath5 ) ; the total cross section for neutron - proton dispersion @xcite , @xmath6 , in units of 10@xmath7 @xmath5 ; and the product @xmath8 , in units of 10@xmath7 s@xmath9 mev@xmath9 , as functions of the energy of incident neutrons .",
    "this last magnitude is proportional to the probability that a neutron with a given energy collides with a proton in water .",
    "it can be noticed that only neutrons with energy lower than a few mev have a significant effect .    , total cross section of the n+p collision , @xmath6 , and the product @xmath8 , as functions of the energy of the incident neutron . ]    from these data , we may estimate the probability of neutron - proton collisions :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the number of protons in 10 ml of water .    in order to compute the energy transfer from the proton to water",
    ", we use the data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the so - called stopping power of protons in water , tabulated in ref . .",
    "by using a monte carlo algorithm , we arrive to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . according to ref .",
    ", energy losses are mainly due to the interaction of the proton with the electrons in the medium , leading to the ionization of water molecules .",
    "the basic process of ionization is : @xmath12 , which requires an energy of 12.62 ev @xcite .",
    "the ejected electron and @xmath13 could lead to secondary ionization processes . dividing the @xmath14 axis of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by 10 , we obtain a rough estimate of the number of ions produced in each 100 nm step of the proton motion , that is around 300 ions at distances close to the n - p collision point , and 30 ions when distance is of the order of 0.1 mm .",
    "as mentioned above , n+p dispersion events in the glucose solution take place every 125 s. we already know that the shower of ions and electrons , created by the proton , is more intense in the first 0.1 mm along the proton trajectory . the bacteria touched by this ion shower could be destroyed or experience a permanent damage , especially in their dna , which can be later inherited by the descendants .",
    "we shall stress that , for the dna changes to be transmitted , the ionization event should take place in the first 8h of daily evolution , according to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . otherwise , there is practically no cellular division in the day it occurred , and the probability to pass to the next day is only 1/100 .    the mean number of bacteria in the first 8h is :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 bacteria , and @xmath17 .",
    "each bacterium occupies a mean volume of around 10 @xmath18 , that is , a cube with sides 45 @xmath19 m long . in the first 0.1 mm=100 @xmath19 m of the ion shower",
    ", only 2 such cubes could be allocated .",
    "the probability that the shower touches a bacterium is , thus :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the lateral dimension of the ion shower .",
    "@xmath21 could be estimated from the debye screening length of pure water :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the boltzman constant , @xmath24 is the relative dielectric constant of water @xcite , @xmath25 is the charge of the ions h@xmath26 y oh@xmath27 in water , and @xmath28 their concentration :    @xmath29    taking all these numbers together , we get @xmath30 . and putting @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ vol ] ) , we get a probability of @xmath32 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 is a magnitude of the same order of the e. coli dimensions , thus the ion shower may cause strong effects on a bacterium",
    ".    we may compute the rate in which bacteria from a single population are touched by the bnr ionization events :    @xmath33    this number is very small , as compared with @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ fspm ] ) .",
    "however , it is consistent with the frequency of deleterious mutations , with damage in the dna repair mechanism , mentioned in section [ eelp ] .",
    "indeed , in @xmath35 generations @xmath36 year @xmath37 s , the bnr had a direct incidence on @xmath38 bacteria . some of them could have experienced damages in the dna repair mechanism .",
    "the 100 times increase in the mutation rate could have given this subpopulation , after 100 - 600 generations , the possibility to generate beneficial mutations that would be fixed , allowing them to become numerically dominant .",
    "the fact that only 4 of 12 populations evolved in this way could be related to the probability @xmath39 that the bnr events take place in the first 8h of daily evolution .",
    "let us notice that we are assuming very fast bnr ionization events , as compared with the bacterial motion .",
    "only those bacteria placed along the ion shower are affected by it .",
    "we may estimate the duration of such a event from :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the conductivity of pure water @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath42 s.    a second estimate for the duration comes from the difussion constants of ions in water @xcite , @xmath43 .",
    "taking @xmath44 as a characteristic dimension , results in :    @xmath45    in both cases , the times are of the order of @xmath46 s. taking into account that , at ambient temperatures , the typical speeds of bacterial motion are around 2 mm / s , only bacteria in contact with the ion shower , or very close to it , will be affected .",
    "the fact that mutations with damage in the dna repair mechanism are deleterious @xcite is also consistent with the nature of bnr ionization processes .",
    "indeed , the electron and ion shower is highly energetic and may produce such damages in the dna , especially in the first steps after the n+p collision .",
    "we shall compare the concentration of produced ions with the concentration of spontaneous ions in water , eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) . in each of the first 100 nm steps",
    ", the ejected proton creates around 300 ions .",
    "the induced concentration is , thus :    @xmath47    that is , 4 times higher than @xmath28 given in ec .",
    "( [ n ] ) .",
    "the presence of ions in such high concentrations is also a strong mutagenic factor .",
    "in the present paper , we indicate a possible correlation between bnr ionization events and the ltee observed rates of deleterious mutations with damages in the dna repair and edit mechanism . in this way",
    ", we are indicating the probable origin of a class of `` spontaneous '' mutations .",
    "the experimental confirmation of this possible correlation is plausible : restart the experiment by using fossils , and shield some of the evolving populations against the bnr .",
    "the shielded cultures should exhibit much lower rates for deleterious mutations with damages in the dna repair mechanism . in around 1 - 2 years ( 2500 - 5000 generations )",
    ", changes in mutation rates should be manifest .    on the other hand , a comment by prof .",
    "lenski @xcite that some cancer cells also exhibit damages in the dna repair mechanism , motivates us to rise the hypothesis about the bnr as one os the processes triggering cancer .",
    "other events , like inhalation of radioactive radon contained in air through breathing , are recognized carcinogens @xcite .",
    "defficient feeding , infectious proceeses , etc could be considered as conditions creating an evolutive pressure over the expossed cells , similar to the limited amount of glucose in the ltee . under these conditions ,",
    "the bnr induced deleterious mutations , with damages in the dna repair and edit mechanism , and the subsequent rise in the rate of spontaneous mutations , could allow the mutators to generate well adapted individuals that could become numerically dominant . in order to check this hypothesis , a controlled experiment in animals",
    "could be designed , for example in mouses , which are widely used as models of cancer in humans @xcite .",
