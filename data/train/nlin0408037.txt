    "the difficulty probably lies in introducing the boundaries in the bilinearized form appropriately for ie i. in this paper , we have successfully obtained all types of localized structures of ie i reported in @xcite through the hirota s bilinearization technique and presented the different types of localized structures admitted by it for the case of both time dependent and stationary boundaries .",

    "also , the class of coherent structures admitted by ( 5.6 ) and hence by ie i are very rich .      if the boundaries are constant , that is @xmath194 and @xmath195 , then going through the various steps indicated above , the function @xmath13 is found out to be @xmath196 the corresponding spin components are @xmath197 in this case , the solution decays algebraically as @xmath198 as @xmath199 .",
