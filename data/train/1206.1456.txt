    "let us try to motivate our work from two different points of view : from the purely mathematic point of view and from the potential applications .",
    "let @xmath0 be a field ( say , of characteristic zero ) and @xmath1 $ ] a univariate polynomial .",
    "a classical question is whether the roots of @xmath2 can be computed exactly .",
    "we know by galois theory that , in general , we can only provide a positive answer ( based on radical expressions ) when the degree is at most 4 .",
    "furthermore , methods to compute them are available . now , take @xmath3 $ ] and formulate the same question .",
    "the first remark is that the dimension of the zero - set ( i.e. the set of roots ) has increased from 0 to 1 .",
    "the answer was given by zariski , who proved in @xcite that this is only possible , in general , when the genus of the curve defined by @xmath4 ( say w.l.o.g .",
    "that @xmath5 is irreducible over the algebraic closure @xmath6 of @xmath0 ) is at most 6 .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , it is shown how to calculate them if the genus is at most 4 ; the cases of genus 5 and 6 are treated algorithmically in @xcite .",
    "an expectable remark is that , when the genus is 0 , the answer is expressed in @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a finite algebraic extension of @xmath0 and @xmath9 is transcendental over @xmath8 , and when @xmath10 genus @xmath11 the answer is given by radical expressions over @xmath7 .",
    "the next step is to formulate the same question when @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "this is the central topic of this article . to our knowledge , there exist no theoretical results establishing the limitations to solve the problem , either by the degree ( in 1 variable ) or by genus ( in 2 variables ) . in this paper",
    "we give the first steps in this direction ; later in this introduction we give more details .",
    "now , let us see the problem from another side .",
    "it is well known that in many applications dealing with geometric objects , parametric representations are very useful .",
    "examples of this affirmation are , for instance :    * when dealing with the intersection of two varieties ( say surfaces or curve / surface ) it is convenient to have a parametric representation of one of them ; * when plotting in the screen a curve or a surface ; * when computing line or surface integrals ; * when dealing with the velocity or the acceleration of a particle following a path on the variety ; * when performing geometric transformations , such as rotations , translations , and scaling ; * when executing projections , etc .",
    "therefore , it is important to provide parametric representations .",
    "there are different options : one can use rational functions , trigonometric parametrizations , piecewise approximate parametrizations , etc . in this paper",
    ", we propose to enlarge the class of rational parametrizations by introducing radical parametrizations , i.e. algebraic expressions involving ( maybe nested ) radicals of polynomials .    to be more precise ,",
    "we introduce the notion of radical parametrization by using basic notions of galois theory as well as the ideas in @xcite , and we provide algorithms to parametrize by radicals some families of surfaces . in section",
    "[ sec - radicals ] , besides introducing the basic notations , we show how to parametrize by radicals some special surfaces , including fermat surfaces . in the next two sections we try to follow the first steps in the theoretical analysis of the rationality of surfaces ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , in section [ sec - parametrization - by - lines ] we generalize the notion of parametrization by lines to the case of radicals . as a consequence we provide an algorithm that parametrizes every surface having a singularity of multiplicity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the degree of the surface and @xmath15 . from these results",
    "we prove that every irreducible surface of degree at most 5 is parametrizable by radicals , and that every singular surface of degree 6 is also parametrizable by radicals .    in section [ sec - pencil ]",
    "we provide algorithms to parametrize by radicals surfaces with a pencil of genus @xmath16 curves , where @xmath17 , with some additional hypotheses when the genus is 1 or 4 .",
    "furthermore , we offer an alternative approach for surfaces with a pencil of non - hyperelliptic genus 4 curves , based on a known theoretical characterization of such curves ; the detection of the hyperelliptic case and its reduction to other cases in this article is well known , see that section for further details .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - offsets ] we prove that radical parametrizations are preserved under certain types of geometric constructions that include offseting and conchoids .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath18 is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero ( say e.g. @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is an irreducible surface defined by the irreducible polynomial @xmath21 $ ] .    the computations and images shown in what follows have been performed with maple and surfex respectively .",
    "we introduce the notion of radical parametrization of a surface by extending the notion of radical parametrization of a curve ( see @xcite ) . for this purpose ,",
    "in the sequel ,    * let @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are transcendental elements over @xmath18 , and * let @xmath24 .    but",
    "first , we recall briefly the classical notion of solvability by radicals .",

    "it is known by brill - noether theory ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter v ) for example ) that genus 4 curves are trigonal ( they admit a @xmath118 map to @xmath221 ) .",

    "the intersection of all the quadric hypersurfaces containing the canonical image is a scroll , and any of its rulings determines a @xmath118 map ; but the ambient dimension is 3 , so the scroll itself is the only quadric hypersurface . since the canonical embedding has as its coordinates a basis of the space of adjoints ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter vi ,  6 ) , @xmath223 the scroll can be calculated explicitly by finding a homogeneous degree 2 relation @xmath224 it remains to calculate a ruling .",
    "we have two cases , which we discern by computing the singularities of the scroll , i.e. solving a linear system of four equations in four variables .",
    "either it has one singularity , and the coordinates of the singularity are rational in the coefficients of the linear system ( thus of the adjoints ) , or it is regular .    * if the scroll is singular point , it is a cone .",
    "the lines that provide its ruling can be calculated by projecting the cone from its vertex ( we obtain a plane conic ) , and then joining the vertex to each point of the conic . finding a point and",

    "if the scroll is not singular , we calculate one point in it ( this can be done , at worst , with one extra square root ) and its tangent space .",
    "the intersection of both is a reducible conic , thus a pair of lines .",
    "let @xmath225 be one of them .",
    "the projection from @xmath225 provides a ruling : each plane containing @xmath225 cuts the scroll in a union of @xmath225 and another line .",

    ", we choose a point in it , say @xmath231 .",
    "the tangent plane at this point is @xmath232 . setting this in the equation of the surface",
    "we obtain @xmath233 producing the two lines @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",

    "indeed , if we define @xmath242 then the primitive parts with respect to @xmath9 of the resultants of @xmath121 and @xmath243 w.r.t . @xmath147 and @xmath148 are @xmath244 from which we solve by radicals to calculate the parametrization .",
    "we finish this section with the observation that for genus 4 in general the surface is radical , though we do not provide an algorithm for the hyperelliptic case .",
    "the idea is that every hyperelliptic curve can be transformed into one of the form @xmath245 where @xmath246 is @xmath247 or @xmath248 ; and there exist algorithms to detect whether a curve is hyperellipic and put it in that form , in such a way that at most a quadratic extension of @xmath139 is needed , thus we can parametrize such curves by radicals using case 1 of section [ sec - radicals ] .",
    "thus we have the following result .",
    "[ theorem genus 4;third part ] if @xmath32 has a pencil of genus 4 curves , then @xmath32 is radical .",
    "in many geometric constructions , as for instance offset or conchoidal curves / surfaces , one observes that even though one starts from a rational parametrization the generated object is not , in general , parametrizable by means of rational functions ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for offsets and @xcite , @xcite for conchoids .",
    "however , if one starts from a radical parametrization the offset ( similarly the conchoid ) is radical . in other words , the class of radical curves / surfaces ( i.e curves / surfaces having a radical parametrization ) are invariant under offsetting and conchoidal constructions .    in this section ,",
    "we state the above claim and we enlarge the family of potential geometric constructions that preserves the class of radical parametrizations . for this purpose , we see the geometric construction from the perspective of algebraic geometry by considering varieties of incidence . to clarify ideas , let us start with two examples ( offsets and conchoids ) and afterwards we present the more general frame .",
    "let @xmath249 be the defining polynomial of an irreducible surface @xmath32 and @xmath250 a non - zero element .",
    "then , we consider the incidence variety ( where @xmath251 and @xmath252 ) @xmath253 the first equation ensures that @xmath254 , the second equation is the sphere center at @xmath255 with radius @xmath256 , the third equation is the normal line to @xmath32 at the point @xmath255 , and the forth equation ensures that the gradient vector is not the zero vector , i.e. that @xmath255 is not singular .",
    "we observe that all @xmath257 , being part of a tuple in @xmath258 , are indeed in the offset .",
    "motivated by this fact , we consider the diagram @xmath259 where @xmath260 , @xmath261 are the natural projections @xmath262 then , the offset to @xmath32 at distance @xmath14 is defined as the zariski closure of @xmath263 .",
    "let @xmath264 be the defining polynomial of an irreducible surface @xmath32 , @xmath250 a non - zero element and @xmath265 ( called the focus ) .",
    "then , we consider the incidence variety @xmath266 the first equation ensures that @xmath254 , the second equation is the sphere center at @xmath255 with radius @xmath14 , and the third equation is the line joining @xmath267 with @xmath268 .",

    "now , in general , if @xmath264 and @xmath32 are as above , we can define a as an incidence diagram @xmath270 where @xmath260 , @xmath261 are the natural projections as above , and @xmath258 is the incidence variety @xmath271 where @xmath272 are the auxiliary variables and @xmath273 are the polynomials defining the algebraic conditions of the geometric construction . in this situation ,",
    "the zariski closure of @xmath274 is the generated from @xmath32 via the geometric construction .",
    "in addition , we define the as the degree of the map @xmath275 ; that is , as the cardinality of the anti - image via @xmath275 of a generic element in @xmath32 .",
    "we finish this section with the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem - geo - construction ] let @xmath32 be a radical irreducible surface , and let @xmath276 be the geometric variety generated from @xmath32 via a geometric construction of degree at most 4",
    ". then @xmath276 is radical .",
    "let the incidence variety @xmath258 of the geometric construction be defined by @xmath277 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a radical parametrization of @xmath32 , and let @xmath33 be the last field in the tower root defining @xmath41 .",
    "since the degree of the construction is at most @xmath87 we know that the algebraic system of equations @xmath278 has at most 4 solutions over the algebraic closure of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath279 be the reduced grbner basis of @xmath280 with respect to a lex order with @xmath281 ; note that the ideal is considered in @xmath282 $ ] .",
    "since the ideal is zero - dimensional , @xmath283 is of the form @xmath284 furthermore the degree of @xmath285 is at most 4 , and every solution of @xmath285 over the algebraic closure of @xmath33 can be continued to a solution of the full system ( see e.g. @xcite p. 194 ) .",
    "therefore , solving by @xmath285 , we express @xmath286 in terms of radicals . now , for each root @xmath287 of @xmath285 , @xmath288 has at most 4 roots .",
    "therefore , @xmath289 can be expressed by radicals .",
    "so , by induction we get all @xmath257 expressed by radicals . therefore , @xmath290 is parametrizable by radicals .",
    "now , taking into account that the offset and conchoidal constructions are of degree 2 , we have the following corollaries .",
