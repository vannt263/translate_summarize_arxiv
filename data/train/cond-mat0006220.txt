    "in spite of intensive research over the past decade the nature of the metallic state in low - dimensional strongly correlated materials is still poorly understood .",
    "widely studied materials include cuprate and organic superconductors@xcite .",
    "many of the properties of the cuprates can not be understood within the fermi liquid picture that has so successfully described conventional metals @xcite .",
    "although some properties of the quasi - two - dimensional molecular crystals , @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4x ( reference@xcite ) and the quasi - one - dimensional bechgaard salts@xcite ( tmtsf)@xmath0x can be explained within a fermi liquid framework others can not .",
    "a particular challenge is understanding the dependence of the magnetoresistance of the bechgaard salts on the direction of the magnetic field , especially ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 under pressures of about 10 kbar @xcite .",
    "the different angular - dependent magnetoresistance effects in quasi - one - dimensional metals are known as the danner @xcite , magic angle ( or lebed ) @xcite , and third angular effects@xcite , depending on whether the magnetic field is rotated in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 plane , respectively .",
    "( the most- and least - conducting directions are the @xmath9 and @xmath10 axes , respectively ) .",
    "the magic angle effect is the most poorly understood of these effects and is the focus of this paper .",
    "if @xmath11 is the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath10 axis then at the `` magic angles '' given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the lattice constants in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , lebed predicted dips in the threshold field for formation of a field - induced spin - density - wave @xcite . although these dips are not observed @xcite , features are seen , mostly at @xmath17 in the torque @xcite and in all components of the resistance @xcite .    a wide range of physical mechanisms",
    "have been proposed to explain these effects including commensurability effects changing the electron - electron scattering rate @xcite , semi - classical transport @xcite , complicated band structures @xcite , hot spots on the fermi surface @xcite , cold spots on the fermi surface @xcite , electron - electron interactions @xcite , non - fermi liquid effects @xcite , and magnetic field induced changes in effective dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the properties of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 at 10 kbar are particularly difficult to understand .",
    "for example , when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current direction the magnetoresistance is smaller than when it is parallel , the opposite of what one observes in ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath18 and in conventional metals .",
    "recently , the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance when the field direction was fixed at the first magic angle was measured @xcite .",
    "it was found to be non - monotonic : as the temperature decreased down to @xmath19 , the magnetoresistance decreased , it increased until @xmath20 , and then decreased .",
    "it has recently been proposed that these two temperatures actually represent phase transitions between metallic and insulating phases @xcite .",
    "the magnetoresistance of the quasi - two - dimensional metal @xmath21-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4mhg(scn)@xmath2 [ m = k , rb , tl ] also exhibits unusual temperature and angular dependence @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify what properties of the magic angle effects can only be explained within a non - fermi liquid framework by seeing what effects can be explained within fermi liquid theory .",
    "the interlayer magnetoresistance is calculated within the framework of semi - classical transport theory .",
    "it is found that if one takes into account the finite bandwith along the most - conducting direction then dips in the magnetoresistance are observed for @xmath22@xcite .",
    "furthermore , if one assumes a simple fermi liquid form for the temperature dependence of the scattering rate then at the magic angles the interlayer magnetoresistance does have a non - monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "hence , one should be cautious about associating maxima and minima in the temperature dependence with metal - insulator transitions .",
    "however , the results obtained gives a poor description of the observed properties when the field is close to the @xmath23-axis and of the resistivity within the layers .",
    "if the electronic dispersion relation is @xmath24 then the electronic group velocity perpendicular to the layers is @xmath25 the interlayer conductivity can be calculated by solving the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation leading to chambers formula @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermi function and @xmath28 is the scattering time which is assumed to be the same at all points on the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath29 is the electron velocity averaged over its trajectories on the fermi surface , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the time dependence of the wave vector @xmath32 is found by integrating the semi - classical equation of motion @xmath33 if the temperature is sufficiently low that @xmath34 then @xmath35 in equation  ( [ eq : chambers ] ) can be replaced by a delta function at the fermi energy and equation  ( [ eq : chambers ] ) becomes @xmath36      in the tight binding approximation the dispersion relation in an orthorhombic crystal can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the inter - site hopping integrals along the different crystal axes . in the bechgaard salts , @xmath40",
    ", the dispersion along the chains can be linearized giving @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fermi velocity and @xmath43 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "this linear dispersion has been used in a number of papers on the magic angle effect @xcite .",
    "if one solves for the interlayer conductivity within semi - classical transport theory one obtains    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the frequency at which an electron traverses the brillouin zone in the @xmath46-direction when the field is parallel to the @xmath47-axis .",
    "clearly this is a smoothly varying function of @xmath11 and does not exhibit any magic angle effects .",
    "we now show that if the full nonlinear dispersion ( [ dispersion ] ) is used then one does obtain magic angle effects .",
    "we will re - derive a result obtained earlier by maki @xcite with a view to elucidating the physics in the process .",
    "the group velocity for the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) is @xmath48 the rate of change of the wave vector @xmath49 , in a magnetic field in the @xmath23-@xmath10 plane , @xmath50 , is given by ( [ prop ] ) , @xmath51 where terms involving @xmath52 have been neglected .",
    "this is valid provided @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the results below will not be valid as @xmath54 .    in order to calculate the @xmath55-component of the velocity one needs to obtain @xmath56 , which equation  ( [ ktime]c ) shows is determined by @xmath57 . to zero - th order in @xmath58 , @xmath59 . integrating equation  ( [ ktime]b ) then gives @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the frequency at which an the electron traverses the brillouin zone in the direction of the @xmath62-axis .    substituting this into equation  ( [ ktime]a ) and integrating gives , to first order in @xmath63 , @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 by using equation  ( [ ktime]c ) and substituting in ( [ kxlebed ] ) , giving    @xmath66 , \\ ] ]    where we have used trigonometric identities to expand @xmath67 .",

    "the size of the dip at the @xmath105-th magic angle , compared the background magnetoresistance will be of order @xmath106 the size of the dips is determined by the parameter @xmath107 , defined by ( [ ga1 ] ) , which is determined by the geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "note that if @xmath108 , ( [ condlebedfinal ] ) reduces to ( [ nomagicangles ] ) .",
    "this is because the limit @xmath109 corresponds to taking a linear dispersion relation .",

    "we now consider what is a realistic value for @xmath115 for the ( tmtsf)@xmath0x materials .",
    "if we look at the the form of @xmath115 in equation  ( [ ga1 ] ) we note that the factor @xmath116 equals the parameter @xmath117 which determines the periodicity of the danner oscillations @xcite . for (",

    "the lattice constants for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 are @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , while for ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath18 , @xmath121 is twice as large due to anion ordering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath122 term depends on the band filling . at three - quarter filling @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "this gives a value for @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "note that for half - filling @xmath127 , and thus @xmath128 and there will be no magic angle effects unless we solve the semi - classical equations to higher order in @xmath58 .",

    "a small difference is that the experimental data shows a small dip near @xmath130 , whereas the theoretical curve shows no such dip .",
    "it is quite possible that the small dips can be explained within semi - classical transport theory if one includes the effect of a finite @xmath131 in the solution of the semi - classical transport equations .",
    "an analogous effect occurs when the field is rotated in the @xmath6 plane : for coherent interlayer transport with finite @xmath131 a peak in the angular - dependent magnetoresistance occurs when the field is parallel to the @xmath9 axis @xcite .",
    "the angular dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath5 at pressures of about 10 kbar is quite different from that shown in figure  [ p4 - 1 ] at fields less than one tesla the angular dependence is similar to that given by eqn .",

    "this can be explained within the framework considered here . if ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath18 is slowly cooled anion ordering occurs and the lattice constant in the @xmath23 direction doubles so in ( [ magicangle ] ) @xmath121 should be replaced by @xmath137 . however ,",
    "if a sample which is not completely anion ordered it will produce features at angles corresponding to half - integers for a fully anion - ordered sample .",

    "this is shown in figure  [ p4 - 3 ] for various values of @xmath176 .",
    "the resistivity is not a monotonic function of temperature but has a minimum when @xmath177 .",
    "if the field is sufficiently high there is also a maximum . using ( [ fl ] )",
    "we see that the minimum occurs at a temperature @xmath178 if @xmath179 then ( [ max ] ) implies @xmath180    we are unaware of any measurements of the temperature dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath18 at the magic angles .",

    "again , qualitatively very different behavior was observed @xcite in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 at 10 kbar .",
    "there it was found that the in - field resistance had a temperature dependence similar to the zero - field resistance .",
    "zheleznyak and yakovenko have given a heuristic argument as to the origin of the maximum and minimum temperatures seen in the intralayer resistance in ref .",
    ", suggesting that metal - insulator and insulator - metal phase transitions occur as the temperature passes through these values @xcite .",
    "they argue that @xmath184 and @xmath185 which is independent of field . above @xmath19",
    "the system is a two - dimensional metal .",
    "below @xmath19 , a magnetic field causes the electron motion in the @xmath23 direction to be quantized resulting in a one - dimensional dispersion and correlations producing insulating behavior . below @xmath186 ,",
    "the interlayer coupling becomes important and metallic behavior is recovered .",
    "in contrast we find that @xmath187 and @xmath186 are given by ( [ tmin ] ) and ( [ tmax ] ) , respectively , and both scale with @xmath188 .",
    "careful measurements should be able to distinguish between these two different field dependences .",
    "this paper only considers the interlayer resistivity @xmath189 , whereas magic angle effects are also seen experimentally in the intralayer resistivity @xmath190 .",
    "maki pointed out that @xcite the semi - classical theory will only give resonances in @xmath190 of order @xmath191 whereas they are observed to be much larger . a possible way around this problem",
    "is that experiments that are meant to measure @xmath190 may actually be measuring some of @xmath189 .",
    "this is because in highly anisotropic metals it is difficult to arrange the contacts and current path so it lies completely within the layers .",
    "this potential problem increases the motivation to make thin film samples of these metals .",
    "it has been shown that within semi - classical transport theory a nonlinear dispersion parallel to the chains is necessary to produce dips in the interlayer magnetoresistance at integer magic angles .",
    "if the field direction is fixed at one of the magic angles then one observes both minima and maxima in the temperature dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance .",
    "this arises from the temperature dependence of the scattering rate . since these maxima and minima can exist within a fermi liquid model one should be cautious about associating them with non - fermi liquid behaviour or metal - insulator transitions . on the other hand , although the fermi liquid model considered here gives a good description of many of the properties of ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 at pressures from 6 to 8 kbar and of ( tmtsf)@xmath0clo@xmath2 it gives a poor description of their properties when the field is parallel to the layers and of the intralayer transport .",
