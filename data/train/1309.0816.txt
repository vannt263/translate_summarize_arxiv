    "the ongoing miniaturization of devices , with structures reaching the nanoscale , has lead to the development of extremely small thermometers @xcite , some of which are so small that they can only be read out with powerful electron microscopes @xcite .",
    "even small thermal machines working in the quantum regime have been suggested @xcite . in order to understand the working of such devices ,",
    "it is necessary to formulate a theory of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics at the microscopic and mesoscopic scales .",
    "a prerequisite for this is a good understanding of the limitations of the concept of temperature at small scales .",
    "the problem with assigning locally a temperature to a small subsystem of a globally thermal system is the following : interactions between the subsystem and its environment that generate correlations can lead to noticeable deviations of the state of the subsystem from a thermal state ( see figure  [ fig : intensivetemperatureproblem ] ) .",
    "hence , given only a subsystem state , there is no canonical way to assign a temperature to the subsystem .",
    "we call this the _ locality of temperature problem_.    the first steps toward a solution of the locality of temperature problem have been taken in refs",
    ".  @xcite , and more recently , within the mindset of quantum information theory , in ref .",
    "the general locality of temperature problem is , however , still open . in this work ,",
    "we conclusively solve it for spin and fermionic lattice systems .",
    "more precisely , we first show that the locality of temperature problem is equivalent to a decay of correlations measured by an averaged generalized covariance that precisely captures the response of expectation values to perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "we expect the corresponding equality to be useful for applications beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we then provide conditions under which the generalized covariance decays exponentially with the distance , including a detailed analysis of the preasymptotic , and of the finite - size regime .",
    "in particular , this exponential decay holds above a universal critical temperature that only depends on the `` connectivity '' of the underlying graph of the model and is an upper bound on physically relevant critical temperatures such as the curie temperature .",
    "while , in the low - temperature regime , quantum lattice models exhibit a great diversity of phases , many of which involve the emergence of long - range or topological order @xcite , in the high - temperature regime , exponential clustering of correlations is expected .",
    "our rigorous results help to delineate the boundary between these two regimes .",
    "they build upon and go significantly beyond previous results on the clustering of correlations in classical systems @xcite , for quantum gases @xcite , i.e. , translation - invariant hamiltonians in the continuum , and cubic lattices @xcite .",
    "mathematically , we significantly contribute to the problem of whether and under which precise conditions thermal quantum states are stable against distant hamiltonian perturbations .",
    "this is particularly relevant in the broader scheme of phase transitions in classical and quantum lattice models @xcite as well as for the foundations of statistical mechanics and the equilibration and thermalization behavior of closed quantum systems @xcite . in the light of the recent surge of interest in these topics , developing",
    "a better understanding of the properties of thermal states has become a timely issue .",
    "a major obstacle to progress on some of the most interesting open questions in this context , such as equilibration time scales in closed quantum systems , is the limited set of mathematical tools available for exploiting the structure of locally interacting hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "our results are among the first that explicitly exploit properties of local hamiltonians , without being limited to very specific models .    for quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite , our results provide a guideline as to how large the finite system size has to be taken in order to be able to sample from the right partition function and , conversely , to identify observables that are best suited to detect long - range correlations .",
    "in fact , our results are reminiscent of known statements about ground states . if a hamiltonian has a unique ground state and is gapped , correlations in its ground state cluster exponentially and faraway regions become essentially uncorrelated .",
    "this is rigorously proven using information theory inspired methods such as lieb - robinson bounds and quasi - adiabatic continuation @xcite .",
    "these rigorous results allow for certified algorithms that efficiently approximate ground states of gapped hamiltonians on classical computers @xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", we are able to show that an exponential decay of correlations renders thermal states locally efficiently simulatable .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : settingandmainresults ] , we formulate the precise setting and explain the main results and their implications . in section  [ sec : connections ] , we discuss connections to known results on phase transitions , thermalization in closed quantum systems , and matrix product operator approximations .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : details ] , we discuss basic properties of the generalized covariance , explain how our results can be made applicable to finite - range @xmath0-body interactions , and state the results for fermionic lattices .",
    "we proceed with proving all theorems in section  [ sec : proofs ] and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    ", we provide a detailed proof of two bounds on truncated cluster expansions , one of which is an important ingredient to the proof of clustering of correlations .",
    "in this section , we introduce the setting , state the locality of temperature problem more formally , and state our results .      as the first result , we state a perturbation formula , which is a general statement about the response of the expectation value of an observable in the thermal state , upon changes in the system hamiltonian .",
    "it does not make any reference to the locality structure of the hamiltonian but turns out to be especially useful when correlations between local observables decay rapidly with distance .    throughout the paper , we assume the hilbert space to be finite dimensional @xcite and denote the _ thermal state _ , or gibbs state , of a hamiltonian @xmath1 at _ inverse temperature _",

    "the generalized covariance appears naturally in our first theorem about the response of expectation values to perturbations .",
    "more precisely , when we are given an unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath13 and perturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 , then the difference of expectation values in the corresponding thermal states is captured by that covariance :    [ thm : perturbation_formula ] let @xmath13 and @xmath1 be hamiltonians acting on the same hilbert space",

    "we refer to the double integral over the covariance in eq .",
    "as the _ averaged ( generalized ) covariance_.      in the remainder of this work , we will be concerned with spin and fermionic lattice systems .",
    "we will only write out everything for spin systems and then later , in sections  [ sec : fermionic_results ] and  [",

    "@xmath38 denotes the full thermal state _ reduced _ to @xmath36 .    for a non - interacting hamiltonian ,",
    "these two states coincide , but , in general , this is not the case due to correlations between @xmath36 and its environment .",
    "this discrepancy raises the question of how to define temperature locally as an intensive quantity , i.e. , the _ locality of temperature problem_.    . the edges in @xmath36 are @xmath39 , boundary edges of @xmath40 are @xmath41 , and  @xmath28 is a shortest path connecting @xmath36 and @xmath41 ; hence , @xmath42 .",
    "the set of edges @xmath39 is an example for an animal of size @xmath43 , while @xmath41 is not connected and hence not an animal . ]      in order to locally assign a temperature to the subsystem @xmath44 it was suggested , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , to extend @xmath36 by a buffer region and define the temperature of @xmath36 via the thermal state of the hamiltonian truncated outside the extended region @xmath40 , see figure  [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the role of the buffer region @xmath40 is to remove the boundary effects and the correlations with the rest of the system that are intuitively the reason for the locality of temperature problem .",
    "nevertheless , it is not obvious how these correlations should be quantified and how large this buffer region needs to be .",
    "we will see shortly that theorem  [ thm : perturbation_formula ] answers these questions .    by @xmath45",
    ", we denote the set of _ boundary edges _ of @xmath40 , i.e. , the edges having overlap with both @xmath40 and its complement @xmath46 .",
    "then , by choosing @xmath47 in theorem  [ thm : perturbation_formula ] , using that @xmath48 , and tracing over @xmath49 , we obtain the following :    [ cor : truncation_formula ] let @xmath1 be a local hamiltonian , let @xmath29 be a subsystem , and denote the corresponding _ boundary hamiltonian _ by @xmath50 , and the _ interpolating hamiltonian _ by @xmath51 with its thermal state @xmath52 $ ] . then , for any operator @xmath53 supported on @xmath40 , @xmath54       & - \\operatorname{tr}\\bigl[a\\,{g}(\\beta)\\bigr]\\\\      & = \\beta\\int_0 ^ 1 { \\mathrm{d}}\\tau \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\mathrm{d}}s\\ , \\operatorname{cov}_{{g}_s(\\beta)}^\\tau ( h_{\\operatorname{\\partial}\\ ! b } , a ) .",

    "if , for a given inverse temperature @xmath2 , correlations over the distance between @xmath36 and @xmath41 are negligible , then the corollary clearly implies that @xmath56 \\approx \\operatorname{tr}[a_b\\,{{g}_{\\upharpoonright \\mathnormal{b}}}(\\beta)]\\ ] ] for any observable @xmath57 on @xmath36 .",
    "also note that such an approximate equality does not hold whenever average correlations over lengths exceeding the distance between @xmath36 and @xmath41 are non - negligible .",
    "hence , we have the following equivalence for the temperature defined via thermal states :    temperature is intensive on a given length scale if and only if correlations ( measured by the averaged generalized covariance ) are negligible compared to @xmath58 on that length scale .    in order to fully exploit corollary  [ cor : truncation_formula ] ,",
    "it is necessary to bound the generalized covariance , which we will do for high temperatures in the next section .      for small temperatures",
    ", correlations can be arbitrarily long - ranged , as is , e.g. , the case for the ferromagnetic ising model in two or higher dimensions below the curie temperature . on the other hand , above a universal critical temperature , depending only on a local property of the interaction graph , correlations cluster exponentially , as we will see next .",
    "given the combinatorial nature of parts of the arguments leading to this result , we need additional notation related to edges and vertices of the lattice . most of the following definitions can be understood intuitively , as is shown in figure  [ fig : lattice ] .",

    "<S> this work is concerned with thermal quantum states of hamiltonians on spin and fermionic lattice systems with short range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we provide results leading to a local definition of temperature , thereby extending the notion of `` intensivity of temperature '' to interacting quantum models . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we derive a perturbation formula for thermal states . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the perturbation is exactly given in terms of a generalized covariance . </S>",
    "<S> for this covariance , we prove exponential clustering of correlations above a universal critical temperature that upper bounds physical critical temperatures such as the curie temperature . as a corollary </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain that above the critical temperature , thermal states are stable against distant hamiltonian perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our results imply that above the critical temperature , local expectation values can be approximated efficiently in the error and the system size . </S>"
