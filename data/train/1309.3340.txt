    "lorenzini recently introduced the notion of a riemann  roch structure on a lattice of rank @xmath0 in @xmath1 and defined a two - variable zeta function associated to each such structure @xcite .",
    "his construction is inspired by earlier work on two - variable zeta functions for number fields and curves over finite fields @xcite , and includes the riemann ",
    "roch theory for graphs from @xcite as the special case when the lattice is the image of the combinatorial laplacian of a graph on @xmath2 vertices .",
    "this note addresses the relationship between his two - variable zeta function in this special case and more classical invariants of graphs , such as the tutte polynomial and the jacobian group , which is the torsion part of the cokernel of the combinatorial laplacian .",
    "let @xmath3 be a finite connected graph without loops or multiple edges , and let @xmath4 be the cokernel of the combinatorial laplacian of @xmath3 .",
    "baker and norine assign a natural degree and rank to each element of @xmath4 , in close analogy with the degree and rank of divisor classes in the picard group of an algebraic curve @xcite , and lorenzini s two - variable zeta function , which we denote @xmath5 , encodes the number of divisor classes in @xmath4 of each degree and rank .",
    "more precisely , @xmath6 \\in \\operatorname{pic}(g ) }   \\frac{u^{h(d ) } - 1}{u-1 } t^{\\deg(d)},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , one more than the baker  norine rank of @xmath8 ; it is the analogue of @xmath9 for a divisor on a smooth algebraic curve .",
    "this zeta function is a rational function and can be expressed as @xmath10 , for some polynomial @xmath11 with integer coefficients .",
    "it also satisfies a functional equation @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 is the order of the jacobian group @xmath14 , the group of divisor classes of degree zero ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.10 ) , which is equal to the number of spanning trees of @xmath3 .",
    "the tutte polynomial @xmath15 also specializes to the order of the jacobian group , and graphs with the same tutte polynomial share many other characteristics .",
    "for instance , they have the same number of @xmath16-colorings for every @xmath16 . for further details on the relationship between tutte polynomials , chip - firing , and jacobians of graphs , see @xcite .",
    "lorenzini asked whether two connected graphs with the same tutte polynomial must have the same zeta functions or isomorphic jacobians , and observed that the answers are affirmative for trees @xcite .",
    "our main results are strong negative answers to both of these questions .",
    "[ thm : zeta ] there are pairs of graphs with the same tutte polynomial and isomorphic jacobians whose zeta functions are not equal .    [ thm : jac ]",
    "there are pairs of graphs with the same tutte polynomial and the same zeta function whose jacobians are not isomorphic .",
    "we also give a pair of graphs with the same zeta functions and isomorphic jacobians whose tutte polynomials are not equal , so no two of these invariants determines the third . in each of these pairs",
    ", the two graphs also have the same number of vertices and edges .",
    "[ rem : method ] although any two trees on the same number of vertices have the same tutte polynomial , they also have trivial jacobians , and it seems to be difficult to construct large classes of pairs of graphs with the same tutte polynomial and nontrivial jacobians .",
    "bollobs , pebody , and riordan conjectured that the tutte polynomial ( and even its chromatic specialization ) is a complete invariant for almost all graphs @xcite .",
    "in this project , we pursued two methods for systematically producing graphs with the same tutte polynomial and nontrivial jacobians .",
    "one method is exhaustive search , which produced most of the examples in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the other method is tutte s rotor construction , using rotors of order 3 , 4 , or 5 .",
    "a _ rotor _ is a graph @xmath17 with an automorphism @xmath18 of the given order @xmath16 and a vertex @xmath19 such that @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ... , @xmath21 are distinct .",
    "tutte s construction takes this rotor together with a map @xmath22 from the set @xmath23 to the vertices of another graph @xmath24 as input .",
    "the output is two new graphs , obtained by gluing @xmath17 to @xmath24 in different ways , identifying @xmath25 with either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "see @xcite for further details and a proof that the resulting two graphs have the same tutte polynomial . note that the same construction with rotors of higher order generally do not produce graphs with the same tutte polynomial @xcite .",
    "tutte s rotor construction sometimes produces pairs of graphs whose jacobians are not isomorphic , as in example  [ ex : rotor ] .",
    "interestingly , however , applying tutte s construction with his original example of a rotor of order 3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 ) has produced pairs of graphs with isomorphic jacobians in all of our test cases .",
    "[ q : rotor ] does tutte s construction with his original example of a rotor of order 3 always produce pairs of graphs with isomorphic jacobians ?    * acknowledgments . *",
    "we thank m. baker , m. kahle , d. lorenzini , f. shokrieh and the referee for helpful conversations and suggestions .",
    "the work of sp is partially supported by nsf dms1068689 and nsf career dms1149054 .",
    "throughout , we consider a finite connected graph @xmath3 , without loops or multiple edges .",
    "let @xmath28 be the vertices of @xmath3 . recall that a divisor on @xmath3 is a formal sum @xmath29 with integer coefficients , and the degree of a divisor is the sum of its coefficients @xmath30 the combinatorial laplacian matrix @xmath31 is the degree matrix minus the adjency matrix of @xmath3 .",
    "its @xmath32th diagonal entry is the number of vertices neighboring @xmath33 and its @xmath34th off - diagonal entry is @xmath35 if @xmath33 is adjacent to @xmath36 , and @xmath37 otherwise .",
    "the combinatorial laplacian @xmath31 determines a map from @xmath1 to the group of divisors whose image is a sublattice of rank @xmath0 .",
    "all divisors in this sublattice have degree zero , so the quotient @xmath4 is graded by degree .",
    "the subgroup consisting of divisor classes of degree zero is called the jacobian of the graph and denoted @xmath14 . since @xmath3 is connected , @xmath14 is the torsion subgroup of the cokernel of @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath3 has @xmath38 edges , then the _ genus _ of @xmath3 is @xmath39    this definition of the genus of a graph is the usual one in the literature on tropical geometry and riemann - roch , and the terminology reflects a close relation to the genus of certain algebraic curves . it should not be confused with the minimal genus of a topological surface in which the graph embeds without crossings , which is also called the genus of the graph in the graph theory literature .",
    "riemann  roch theory for graphs , as developed by baker and norine in @xcite , associates an integer rank @xmath40 to each divisor @xmath8 on @xmath3 , analogous to the dimension of a complete linear series on an algebraic curve . for the purposes of this note , we follow lorenzini and work with the invariant @xmath7 , which is analogous to the dimension of the space of global sections of a line bundle .",
    "it depends only on the class @xmath41 $ ] in @xmath4 .",
    "suppose @xmath8 has degree @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath42 is negative , then @xmath43 is zero , and if @xmath44 then @xmath45 .",
    "brill  noether theory , for graphs as for algebraic curves , is concerned with the existence and geometry of divisor classes of given degree and rank . for a finite graph",
    ", one can simply count these classes , and these counts are encoded in lorenzini s two - variable zeta function @xmath6 \\in \\operatorname{pic}(g ) }   \\frac{u^{h(d ) } - 1}{u-1 } t^{\\deg(d)}.\\ ] ] note that two graphs have the same zeta function if and only if they have the same number of divisor classes of each degree and rank .",
    "in particular , any two graphs with the same zeta function have the same number of divisor classes of degree zero , i.e. their jacobians have the same size .",
    "see @xcite for further details on the brill  noether theory of graphs .",
    "our first example is a pair of graphs with the same tutte polynomial and isomorphic jacobians whose zeta functions are different .",
    "[ ex : zeta ]    each of the following two graphs is a wedge sum of a triangle with the genus two graph on four vertices ; the difference is the vertex of the genus two graph at which the triangle is attached . because the jacobian group of a wedge sum of graphs is the product of the jacobian groups , and the tutte polynomial of a wedge sum is the product of the tutte polynomials , these two graphs have the same tutte polynomials and isomorphic jacobians .",
    "one can also compute directly for each graph that the tutte polynomial is @xmath46 and the jacobian is isomorphic to @xmath47 .",
    "however , @xmath48 has a divisor class of degree 2 and rank 1 , represented by twice the rightmost vertex , while @xmath49 has no such divisor class .",
    "this can be checked directly , by computing the ranks of each of the 24 divisor classes of degree 2 on @xmath49 and on @xmath48 .",
    "alternatively , one may recall that a graph has a divisor class of degree 2 and rank 1 if and only if it has an involution such that the quotient of the geometric realization by the induced topological involution is a tree @xcite and observe that @xmath48 has such an involution , given by a vertical reflection in the figure above , while @xmath49 has no such involution .",
    "it follows that the zeta functions of these two graphs are distinct .",
    "we find that the zeta functions are @xmath50    and    @xmath51    our next example is a pair of graphs with the same tutte polynomial and zeta function whose jacobians are not isomorphic .    [ ex : jac ] consider the following two graphs of genus @xmath52 on @xmath53 vertices .",
    "each of these graphs has tutte polynomial @xmath54 and zeta function @xmath55 however , their jacobians are not isomorphic , with @xmath56    examples [ ex : zeta ] and [ ex : jac ] answer lorenzini s original questions , and prove theorems  [ thm : zeta ] and [ thm : jac ] , respectively .",
    "the graphs in example  [ ex : zeta ] have a cut vertex , and those in example  [ ex : jac ] can be disconnected by removing two edges , but there are other ( more complicated ) examples with higher connectivity whose tutte polynomials , jacobians , and zeta functions exhibit similar properties .",
    "for instance , we found a pair of 3-connected graphs of genus 8 on 8 vertices with the same tutte polynomial and isomorphic jacobians , whose zeta functions are not equal , as well as a pair of 3-connected graphs of genus 10 on 9 vertices with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic .",
    "it is not clear what natural graph - theoretic conditions could imply that two graphs with the same tutte polynomial would also have the same zeta functions , though we did find experimental evidence suggesting that tutte s rotor construction with certain rotors might produce pairs of graphs with isomorphic jacobians .",
    "see remark  [ rem : method ] and question  [ q : rotor ] , above .",
    "example  [ ex : jac ] also gives a negative answer to another question of lorenzini .",
    "cori and rossin proved that planar dual graphs",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath57 have isomorphic jacobians @xcite , and lorenzini asked @xcite whether the existence of this isomorphism follows from the symmetry relating their tutte polynomials @xmath58 the graphs @xmath59 and @xmath60 are planar and have the same tutte polynomial , so we can choose a planar embedding of @xmath60 to get a dual graph @xmath61 .",
    "the same symmetry holds , @xmath62 , but the jacobians of @xmath59 and @xmath61 are not isomorphic .",
    "we also observe that there are pairs of graphs with the same zeta functions and isomorphic jacobians whose tutte polynomials are different , as in the following example .    [ ex : tutte ] consider the following pair of graphs of genus 7 on 7 vertices .",
    "we find that @xmath63 and @xmath64 both have jacobians isomorphic to @xmath65 and zeta functions equal to @xmath66 however , we find that their tutte polynomials are @xmath67 and @xmath68    in the next example , we construct a pair of graphs with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic using tutte s rotor construction .    [ ex : rotor ] we now apply tutte s rotor construction to the base graph @xmath69 and rotor @xmath70 to construct two graphs of genus 9 on 11 vertices with the same tutte polynomial .",
    "the rotor construction involves gluing the vertices @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 of @xmath69 to the vertices @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 of @xmath70 in two different ways . in both cases , we glue @xmath77 . for @xmath78",
    ", we glue @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whereas for @xmath81 we glue @xmath82 and @xmath83 , as shown .        by @xcite , the graphs @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath81 have the same tutte polynomial , which we compute to be @xmath84    however , we find that their jacobians are not isomorphic , with @xmath85 these two graphs also have distinct zeta functions , with @xmath86 and @xmath87    by exhaustive search , we find that there are no pairs of graphs on 7 or fewer vertices with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic",
    ". on 8 vertices , there are 11117 isomorphic classes of connected graphs , and we find only two such pairs .",
    "these are the pairs in example  [ ex : jac ] above , and in example  [ ex : smallest ] below . on 9 vertices , there are 261080 isomorphism classes of connected graphs , but we find only 122 pairs of graphs with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic .",
    "some graphs appear in several pairs ; these 122 pairs involve 99 different graphs with 33 different tutte polynomials .",
    "[ ex : smallest ] as mentioned above , there are only two pairs of graphs on 8 vertices with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic .",
    "one such pair is given in example  [ ex : jac ] .",
    "the other is the following pair of graphs of genus 5 , which we include for completeness .",
    "each of these graphs has tutte polynomial @xmath88    and zeta function    @xmath89    however , we find that their jacobians are not isomorphic , with @xmath90    gimnez and merino independently found a pair of graphs with the same tutte polynomial whose jacobians are not isomorphic @xcite .",
    "their example consists of two planar graphs of genus 10 on 12 vertices whose zeta functions are not equal .",
    "jacobians of graphs are frequently cyclic , as has been observed by lorenzini and others .",
    "perturbing a graph with non - cyclic jacobian slightly , by subdividing an edge , tends to produce graphs with cyclic jacobians .",
    "see , for instance , the computation of cyclic jacobians for modified wheel graphs in @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was observed again by robeva in 2008 , in computations related to the tropical proof of the brill  noether theorem @xcite , and we encountered it once more through extensive computations exploring the questions addressed in this paper .    in the course of this investigation , we observed a somewhat more precise structure .",
    "the jacobian group of a graph comes with a canonical duality pairing @xcite , and a finite abelian group with duality pairing @xmath91 seems to appear with frequency proportional to @xmath92 here , @xmath93 denotes the subgroup of the automorphism group of @xmath3 that preserves the pairing . this experimentally observed variation on the cohen  lenstra heuristic @xcite should explain the prevalence of cyclic jacobians .",
    "we find that the jacobian of a random graph is cyclic with probability slightly greater than @xmath94 .",
    "further details on this heuristic and our experiments with jacobians of random graphs are presented in @xcite , some of our conjectures based on this heuristic are proved in @xcite , and connections to symmetric function theory and hall - littlewood polynomials are studied in @xcite .",
