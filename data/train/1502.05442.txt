    "in this article , we characterize the extreme - strike behavior of implied volatility curves for fixed maturity for uncorrelated gaussian stochastic volatility models .",
    "this introduction contains a careful description of the problem s background and of our motivations . before going into details , we summarize some of the article s specificities ; all terminology in the next two paragraphs is referenced , defined , and/or illustrated in the remainder of this introduction .    we hold calibration of volatility smiles as a principal motivator .",
    "cognizant of the fact that non - centered gaussian volatility models can be designed in a flexible and parsimonious fashion , we adopt that class of models , imposing no further conditions on the marginal distribution of the volatility process itself , beyond pathwise continuity .",
    "the spectral structure of second - wiener chaos variables allows us to work at that level of generality .",
    "we find that the first three terms in the extreme - strike implied volatility asymptotics  which is typically amply sufficient in applications  can be determined explicitly thanks to three parameters characterizing the top of the spectral decomposition of the integrated variance . in order to prove such a precise statement while relying on a moderate amount of technicalities , we make use of the the simplifying assumption that the stochastic volatility is assumed independent of the stock price s driving noise .    when considering the trade - off between this restriction and calibration considerations , we observe that our model flexibility combined with known explicit spectral expansions and numerical tools may allow practicioners to compute the said spectral parameters in a straightforward fashion based on smile features , while also allowing them to select their favorite gaussian volatility model class",
    ". specific examples of gaussian volatility processes are non - centered brownian motion , brownian bridge , and ornstein - uhlenbeck models .",
    "this last sub - class can be particularly appealing to practitioners since it contains stationary volatilities , and includes the well - known stein - stein model .",
    "we also mention how any gaussian model specification , including long - memory ones , can be handled , thanks to the numerical ability to determine its spectral elements .",
    "we understand that the assumption of the stochastic volatility model being uncorrelated implies the symmetry of the implied volatility in the wings , which in some applications , is not a desirable feature ; on the other hand , in many option markets , liquidity considerations limit the ability to calibrate using the large - strike wing ( see the calibration study on spx options in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.4 ) ) .",
    "the case of a correlated gaussian stochastic volatility model is more complicated , but constitutes an interesting mathematical challenge , which we will investigate separately from this article , since one may need to develop completely new methods and techniques .",
    "an important step toward a better understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the implied volatility in some correlated stochastic volatility models is found in the articles dfjv1,dfjv2 .",
    "another problem which is mathematically interesting and important in practice is the asymptotics for implied volatility in small or large time to maturity , on which we report in separate works .",
    "studies in quantitative finance based on the black - scholes - merton framework have shown awareness of the inadequacy of the constant volatility assumption , particularly after the crash of 1987 , when practitioners began considering that extreme events were more likely than what a log - normal model will predict .",
    "propositions to exploit this weakness in log - normal modeling systematically and quantitatively have grown ubiquitous to the point that implied volatility ( iv ) , or the volatility level that market call option prices would imply if the black - scholes model were underlying , is now a _ bona fide _ and vigorous topic of investigation , both at the theoretical and practical level .",
    "the initial evidence against constant volatility simply came from observing that iv as a function of strike prices for liquid call options exhibited non - constance , typically illustrated as a convex curve , often with a minimum near the money as for index options , hence the term ` volatility smile ' .",
    "stock price models where the volatility is a stochastic process are known as stochastic volatility models ; the term ` uncorrelated ' is added to refer to the submodel class in which the volatility process is independent of the noise term driving the stock price . in a sense , the existence of the smile for any uncorrelated stochastic volatility model was first proved mathematically by renault and touzi in @xcite .",
    "they established that the iv as a function of the strike price decreases on the interval where the call is in the money , increases on the interval where the call is out of the money , and attains its minimum where the call is at the money .",
    "note that renault and touzi did not prove that the iv is locally convex near the money , but their work still established stochastic volatility models as a main model class for studying iv ; these models continued steadily to provide inspiration for iv studies .    a current emphasis , which has become fertile mathematical ground , is on iv asymptotics , such as large / small - strike , large - maturity , or small - time - to - maturity behaviors .",
    "these are helpful to understand and select models based on smile shapes .",
    "several techniques are used to derive iv asymptotics .",
    "for instance , by exploiting a method of moments and the representation of power payoffs as mixtures of a continuum of calls with varying strikes , in a rather model - free context , r. lee proved in @xcite that , for models with positive moment explosions , the squared iv s large strike behavior is of order the log - moneyness @xmath1 times a constant which depends explicitly on supremum of the order of finite moments .",
    "a similar result holds for models with negative moment explosions , where the squared iv behaves like @xmath2 for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "more general formulas describing the asymptotic behavior of the iv in the ` wings ' ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) were obtained in @xcite ( see also the book @xcite ) .    from the standpoint of modeling , one of the advantages of lee s original result is the dependence of iv asymptotics merely on some simple statistics , namely as we mentioned , in the notation in @xcite , the maximal order @xmath6 of finite moments for the underlying @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 < \\infty \\right\\ } .\\]]this allows the author to draw appropriately strong conclusions about model calibration .",
    "a typical class in which @xmath6 is positive and finite is that of gaussian volatility models , which we introduce next .",
    "we consider the stock price model of the following form : @xmath9 ,   \\label{mart}\\]]where the short rate @xmath10 is constant , @xmath11 with @xmath12 an arbitrary continuous deterministic function on @xmath13 $ ] ( the mean function ) , and @xmath14 is a continuous centered gaussian process on @xmath13 $ ] independent of @xmath15 , with arbitrary covariance @xmath16 .",
    "note that it is not assumed in ( [ e : mart ] ) that the process @xmath17 is a solution to a stochasic differential equation as is often assumed in classical stochastic volatility models .",
    "a well - known special example of a gaussian volatility model is the stein - stein model introduced in @xcite , in which the volatility process @xmath17 is the so - called mean - reverting ornstein - uhlenbeck process satisfying @xmath18where @xmath12 is the level of mean reversion , @xmath19 is the mean - reversion rate , and @xmath20 is level of uncertainty on the volatility ; here @xmath21 is another brownian motion , which may be correlated with @xmath15 . in the present paper ,",
    "we adopt an analytic technique , encountered for instance in the analysis of the uncorrelated stein - stein model by this paper s first author and e.m .",
    "stein in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "returning to the question of the value of @xmath6 , for a gaussian volatility model , it can sometimes be determined by simple calculations , which we illustrate here with an elementary example .",
    "assume @xmath22 is a geometric brownian motion with random volatility , i.e. a model as in ( mart ) where ( abusing notation ) @xmath23 is taken the non - time - dependent @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant and @xmath17 is an independent unit - variance normal variate ( not dependent on @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , at time @xmath27 , with zero discount rate , @xmath28 . to simplify this example to the maximum , also assume that @xmath17 is centered ; using the independence of @xmath17 and @xmath15 , we get that we may replace @xmath29 by @xmath17 in this example , since this does not change the law of @xmath7 ( i.e. in the uncorrelated case , @xmath17 s non - positivity does not violate standard practice for volatility modeling ) .",
    "then , using maturity @xmath30 , for any @xmath31 , the @xmath32th moment , via a simple change of variable , equals@xmath33 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{1+p\\sigma ^{2}}}\\iint_{\\mathbf{r}^{2}}dx~dy~\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( y^{2}+w^{2}-2\\frac{p\\sigma } { \\sqrt{1+p\\sigma ^{2}}}wy\\right ) \\right)\\]]which by an elementary computation is finite , and equal to @xmath34 , if and only if @xmath35 in the cases where the random volatility model @xmath17 above is non - centered and is correlated with @xmath15 , a similar calculation can be performed , at the essentially trivial expenses of invoking affine changes of variables , and the linear regression of one normal variate against another .",
    "the above example illustrates heuristically that , by lee s moment formula , the computation of @xmath6 might be the quickest path to obtain the leading term in the large - strike expansion of the iv , for more complex gaussian volatility models , namely ones where the volatility @xmath17 is time - dependent .",
    "however , computing @xmath6 is not necessarily an easy task , and appears , perhaps surprisingly , to have been performed rarely . for the stein - stein model",
    ", the value of @xmath6 can be computed using the sharp asymptotic formulas for the stock price density near zero and infinity , established in @xcite for the uncorrelated stein - stein model , and in @xcite for the correlated one .",
    "these two papers also provide asymptotic formulas with error estimates for the iv at extreme strikes in the stein - stein model . beyond the stein - stein model , little",
    "was known about the extreme strike asymptotics of general gaussian stochastic volatility models . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the above - mentioned results from @xcite and @xcite to such models .      adopting the perspective that an asymptotic expansion for the iv can be helpful for model selection and calibration , our objective is to provide an expansion for the iv in a gaussian volatility model relying on a minimal number of parameters , which can then be chosen to adjust to observed smiles .",
    "the restriction of non - correlated volatility means that the stock price distribution is a mixture model of geometric brownian motions with time - dependent volatilities , whose mixing density at time @xmath27 is that of the square root of a variable in the second - chaos of a wiener process . that second - chaos variable is none other than the integrated variance@xmath36by relying on a general hilbert - space structure theorem which applies to the second wiener chaos , we prove that , in the most general case of a non - centered gaussian stochastic volatility with a possible degeneracy in the eigenstructure of the covariance @xmath16 of @xmath17 viewed as a linear operator on @xmath37\\right ) $ ] ( i.e. when the top eigenvalue @xmath38 is allowed to have a multiplicity @xmath39 larger than @xmath40 ) , the large - strike iv asymptotics can be expressed with three terms which depend explicitly on @xmath27 and on the following three parameters : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the ratio @xmath41where @xmath42 is the norm in @xmath43\\right ) $ ] of the orthogonal projection of the mean function @xmath12 on the first eigenspace of @xmath16 .",
    "specifically , with @xmath44 the iv as a function of strike @xmath3 , letting @xmath45 be the discounted log - moneyness , as @xmath46 , we prove@xmath47where the constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend explicitly on @xmath27 and @xmath38 , and @xmath49 also depends explicitly on @xmath50 .",
    "the details of these constants are in theorem [ t : isvm ] on page .",
    "a similar asymptotic formula is obtained in the case where @xmath51 , using symmetry properties of uncorrelated stochastic volatility models ( see formula ( [ e : ee ] ) on page ) .",
    "the specific case of the stein - stein model is expanded upon in some detail .",
    "numerical illustrations of how the small strike asymptotics can be used are provided in section num , in the context of calibration ; we explain some of the calibration ideas in the next subsection .",
    "the first - order constant @xmath48 is always strictly positive .",
    "the second - order term ( the constant @xmath49 ) vanishes if and only if @xmath12 is orthogonal to the first eigenspace of @xmath16 , which occurs for instance when @xmath52 .",
    "the third - order term vanishes if and only if the top eigenvalue has multiplicity one , which is typical .",
    "the behavior of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as functions of @xmath27 is determined partly by how the top eigenvalue @xmath38 depends on @xmath27 , which can be non - trivial . in the present paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath27 is fixed .    for fixed maturity @xmath27 , assuming that @xmath16 has lead multiplicity @xmath53 for instance , a practitioner will have the possibility of determining a value @xmath38 and a value @xmath50 to match the specific root - log - moneyness behavior of small- or large - strike iv ; moreover in that case , choosing a constant mean function @xmath12 , one obtains @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the top eigenfunction of @xmath16 .",
    "market prices may not be sufficiently liquid at extreme strikes to distinguish between more than two parameters ; this is typical of calibration techniques for implied volatility curves for fixed maturity , such as the ` stochastic volatility inspired ' ( svi ) parametrization disseminated by j. gatheral : see @xcite ( see also @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "our result shows that gaussian volatility models with non - zero mean are sufficient for this flexibility , and provide equivalent asymptotics irrespective of the precise mean function and covariance eigenstructure , since modulo the disappearance of the third - order term in the unit top multiplicity case @xmath53 , only @xmath38 and @xmath50 are relevant .",
    "moreover , our gaussian parametrization is free of arbitrage , since it is based on a semi - martingale model ( [ mart ] ) . in the case of svi parametrization",
    ", the absence of arbitrage can be non - trivial , as discussed in @xcite and gj .",
    "modelers wishing to stick to well - known classes of processes for @xmath17 may then adjust the value of @xmath38 by exploiting any available invariance properties for the desired class@xmath56 for example , if @xmath17 is standard brownian motion , or the brownian bridge , on @xmath13 $ ] , we have @xmath57 or @xmath58 respectively , and these values scale quadratically with respect to a multiplicative scaling constant for @xmath17 , beyond which an arbitrary mean value @xmath12 may be chosen . if @xmath17 is the mean - zero stationary ou process , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the smallest positive solution of @xmath61 , in which case , for a fixed arbitrarily selected rate of mean reversion @xmath19 , a scaling of @xmath38 is then equivalent to selecting the variance of @xmath17 , while a constant mean value @xmath12 can then be selected independently .",

    "* chapter 1 ) ) , and need to be referenced when selecting @xmath62 for the ou bridge , the eigenstructure of @xmath16 ( equivalently known as the karhunen - love expansion of @xmath16 ) was found in @xcite , while in @xcite , such an expansion was characterized for special gaussian processes generated by independent pairs of exponential random variables . on the other hand ,",
    "fractional brownian motion and ou processes driven by fractional brownian motion do not fall in the class of gaussian processes for which the karhunen - love expansion is known explicitly",

    "it is known that the out - of - the - money call options market is poorly liquid , implying that the large strike asymptotics for call and iv prices are typically not visible in the data .",
    "we concentrate instead on small strike asymptotics . there , depending on the market segment , options with maturities on the scale of one or several months can be liquid with small bid - ask spread for log moneyness as far down as @xmath284 . convincing visual evidence of this can be found in figures 3 and 4 in @xcite which report 2011 data for spx options . based on this , we will use the value @xmath284 as an illustrative lower bound for @xmath105 : beyond this lower bound , liquidity is insufficient to measure iv .",
    "this immediately creates a problem due to the similar magitude , in this range of @xmath105 , of the constant term @xmath49 and the next term in the expansion whose order we can only guarantee to be no larger than @xmath285 , according to the big @xmath274 term in corollary [ c : corol ] part ( i ) .    in spite of this , calibration of @xmath38 to @xmath48 as in ( calibration ) works well in practice , as our examples below show .",
    "we also find that the inability to neglect @xmath286 compared to @xmath49 introduces a bias in the calibration , whose magnitude , while not constant , gives a good idea of the relative size of the next term in the small strike expansion , motivating the open problem of looking for this next term , and perhaps the following one .",
    "we begin with the stationary uncorrelated stein - stein model with constant mean - reversion level @xmath12 , rate of mean reversion @xmath287 , and so called vol - vol parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the systems of equations needed to perform calibration here have a somewhat triangular structure . according to section [ s : uss ] , if one is to calibrate @xmath287 , access to @xmath219 is needed , if one may rely on independent knowledge of the level of mean reversion @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , one would solve the following system@xmath288where unfortunately the constant @xmath289 also depends on the unknowns @xmath290 in the following non - trivial way:@xmath291since @xmath287 is not fixed , the task of determining which value of @xmath292 represents the minimal solution of the first equation above , given the large number of solutions to the above system , is difficult . we did not pursue this avenue further for this reason , and because the aforementioned bias due to liquidity means that one would not be in the right asymptotic regime .",

    "independently of this , based on @xmath48 , the first relation in ( [ calibration ] ) determine @xmath38 . then according to equation ( [ e : lambda ] ) , we obtain immediately@xmath293we simulated iv data for the call option with @xmath294 ( signifying a typical mean level of volatility of @xmath295 ) , @xmath296 ( fast mean reversion , every eight weeks or so ) , and @xmath297 ( high level of volatility uncertainty ) .",
    "how to estimate @xmath48 from the data is not unambiguous .",
    "we adopt a least - squares method , on an interval of @xmath105-values of fixed length ; after experimentation , as a rule of thumb , an interval of length @xmath298 provides a good balance between providing a local estimate and drawing on enough datapoints .",
    "we start the interval as far to the left as possible while avoiding any range where the data representing the function @xmath299 may exhibit clear signs of convexity .",
    "this is in an effort to coincide with values of @xmath105 for which sufficient liquidity exists in practice . as a guide to assess this liquidity",
    ", we use the study reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.4 ) , which we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this liquidity depends heavily on the option maturity .    for a one - month @xmath300 option , the above calibration method reports @xmath301 , based on the interval @xmath302 $ ] . for a three - month option ( @xmath303 ) , the method reports @xmath304 , based on the interval @xmath305 $ ] .",
    "other calibrations , not reported here because of their similarity with these two , show that calibration accuracy increases with more liquid options , which is consistent with the intuition that being able to use intervals further to the left should allow a better match with the asymptotic regime ( [ e : onemore1 ] ) .",
    "the graphs of the data versus the asymptotic curve , showing excellent agreement for the first term @xmath306 , are given in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 .    as mentioned above",
    ", this agreement explains why this calibration for @xmath307 works well even though there is a clear bias between the curve @xmath308 ( solid lines in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 ) and the true ( simulated ) iv data ( blue data points in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 ) . one may immediately conjecture that the gap between the solid and discrete lines is representative of the term @xmath286 in corollary [ c : corol ] , in the sense that the next term in the expansion might be of the form @xmath309 for some constant @xmath310 , and that our simulation might give us access to the value of @xmath310 .",
    "this does not appear to be quite the case .",
    "when graphing the expression for @xmath311   \\sqrt{-k}$ ] using data from the previous figure , instead of finding a quantity which is largely constant , we find values which vary non - linearly between @xmath312 and @xmath313 , as seen in fig .",
    "this is indicative that , to have access to calibration based on the value of @xmath49 , it might be necessary to find more terms in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we now explain how to include one more term in formula ( [ asymp ] ) , specifically , how to obtain the following expansion : @xmath314as @xmath51 when @xmath53 .",
    "it is possible to establish formula ( [ just ] ) by using formula ( [ e : finchi ] ) instead of a weaker two - sided estimate given in ( [ e : fi1 ] ) , and also formula ( [ e : sic2 ] ) and theorem 5.6 in @xcite , characterizing the asymptotic behavior of log - normal integrals . combining these results ,",
    "we obtain a sharp asymptotic formula for the density @xmath315 with a relative error estimate @xmath316 as @xmath198 .",
    "after that , theorem 14 in @xcite can be used to establish ( [ just ] ) .",
    "obtaining the expression for the constant @xmath310 is tractable but sufficiently non - trivial that we omit the details . even in the case",
    "where the volatility process is centered and @xmath53 , this @xmath310 depends on all @xmath317 with @xmath318 and @xmath319 with @xmath320 .",
    "we also conjecture that when @xmath53 and @xmath321 , @xmath322as @xmath51",
    ". this conjecture would not be sufficient to guarantee that including the four terms identified above would be enough to provide a good approximation when @xmath276 is restricted to values around @xmath40 or lower , since there a series in negative powers of @xmath323 will diverge unless its coefficients decay fast enough .",
    "yet fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 show , at least in those particular examples , that the discrepancy which might correspond to @xmath324 is not large , and that the term @xmath325 would only be needed to account for a moderate uncertainty level on the value of @xmath310 , ranging from @xmath312 to @xmath313 .",
    "this gives hope that the first three or four terms in the expansion ( [ conjecture ] ) could provide an excellent approximation to the iv even for values of @xmath276 lower than @xmath40 .    while the conjecture in ( [ conjecture ] ) may be correct , the last analysis above attemps to push the boundaries of its possible validity beyond its natural range because of option market liquidity considerations .",
    "this empirical consideration seems to rely on the class of gaussian volatility models one chooses .",
    "this becomes evident in the second class of examples we present , that of fou volatility .",
    "there , as we will see , the bias between @xmath326 and @xmath327 can not reasonably be considered small , so that the conjecture in ( [ conjecture ] ) may not be helpful .",
    "nevertheless , our calibration strategy still produces good results when applied to the fou s memory parameter .",
    "we now provide the details .",
    "the continuous - time fou volatility model was introduced in @xcite as a way to model long - range dependence in non - linear functionals of stock returns , while preserving the uncorrelated semi - martingale structure at the level of returns themselves .",
    "this is the model for @xmath17 in ( [ ou ] ) where the process @xmath21 is a fractional brownian motion , i.e. the continuous gaussian process started at @xmath328 with covariance determined by @xmath329 = \\left\\vert t - s\\right\\vert ^{2h } $ ] , with hurst  parameter @xmath330 . in @xcite , it was shown empirically that standard statistical methods for long - memory data are inadequate for estimating @xmath331 .",
    "this difficulty can be attributed to the fact that the volatility process @xmath17 can have non - stationary increments . in addition , some of the classical methods use path regularity or self - similarity as a proxy for long memory , which can not be exploited in practice since there is a lower limit to how frequenty observations can be made without running into microstructure noise . to make matters worse ,",
    "the process @xmath17 is not directly observed ; in such a partial observation case , a general theoretical result was given in @xcite , by which the rate of convergence of any estimator of @xmath331 can not exceed an optimal @xmath331-dependent rate which is always slower than @xmath332 , where @xmath310 is the number of observations .",
    "given the non - stationarity of the parameter @xmath333 on a monthly scale , a realistic time series at the highest observation frequency where microstructure noise can be ingored ( e.g. one stock observation every 5 minutes ) would not permit even the optimal estimators described in @xcite from pinning down a value of @xmath331 with any acceptable confidence level .",
    "the work in @xcite proposes a calibration technique based on a straightforward comparison of simulated and market option prices to determine @xmath331 .",
    "our strategy herein is similar , but based on implied volatility .",
    "we consider the fou model described above with the following parameters : @xmath334 , @xmath294 , @xmath296 , @xmath297 , with different values of the hurst parameter @xmath335 .",
    "as mentioned above , we simulated option prices using standard monte carlo , where the fou process is produced by a.t .",
    "dieker s circulant method . since the values of @xmath336 for each @xmath337",
    "are not known explicitly or semi - explicitly , we resorted to the method developed in by s. corlay in @xcite for optimal quantification : there , the infinite - dimensional eigenvalue problem is converted to a matrix eigenvalue problem which uses a low - order quadrature rule for approximating integrals ( a trapezoidal rule is recommended ) , after which a richardson - romberg extrapolation is used to improve accuracy .",
    "we repeat this procedure for the fou process with the above parameters , for each value of @xmath331 from @xmath338 to @xmath339 , with increments of @xmath340 .",
    "the corresponding values we obtain for @xmath38 in each case are collected in the following table :              our illustration of the calibration method then consists of starting with simulated iv data for a fou model with fixed @xmath331 , then implementing the same procedure as in the stein - stein example to determine the value of @xmath346 by using an interval of length @xmath298 which is realistic in terms of liquidity constraints , and then matching that value of @xmath38 to the closest value in the above table , thereby concluding that the simulated data is consistent with the corresponding value of @xmath331 in the table .",
    "the results of this method are summarized as follows@xmath347       our method shows a good level of accuracy , though it does not appear capable of distinguishing between the case of no memory @xmath348 and a simulation with very low memory ( @xmath349 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the method has some sensitivity to the intervals being used , particularly for small true values of @xmath331 : in that case the first term in the implied volatility asymptotic curve seems to dictate a need for including data points for log - moneyness @xmath105 near @xmath284 . for higher values of @xmath331 , we noted greater robustness to the interval being used to estimate @xmath48 .",
    "for example , with a true @xmath350 used in simulation , calibrated values of @xmath351 and @xmath350 were obtained with the intervals @xmath352 $ ] and @xmath353 $ ] respectively .",
    "more generally , one notes that the bias between the curve @xmath327 and the simulated iv data is much larger when @xmath337 than in the classical stein - stein case where @xmath354 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . this provides an even stronger call than in the case @xmath354 to compute the constants @xmath310 and @xmath355 in the conjecture in relation ( [ conjecture ] ) , as functions of the first few kl eigen - elements .",
    "we also computed the fou s kl eigenvalues @xmath356 and @xmath357 for each @xmath358 , though these are not used in our calibration .",
    "they are nevertheless instructive since they indicate at what speed the kl expansions of @xmath17 and of the integrated variance @xmath359 might converge . without reporting all the values ,",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath360 decreases from @xmath361 for @xmath348 to @xmath362 for @xmath363 , while for @xmath364 , the values are even smaller , decreasing from @xmath365 to @xmath366 over the same range of @xmath331 . if the values of @xmath367 and @xmath368 in our conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) are of the same order as the ratio @xmath369 , this could give additional hope that computing @xmath370 in the fou case might be enough to implement a two - parameter calibration , with only a few values of @xmath371 needed to approximate @xmath372 .    finally , by comparing fig .",
    "1 with the first graph in fig .",
    "4 , where all ou parameters remain the same except for @xmath331 which goes from @xmath373 to @xmath374 , one notes that the difference @xmath375 jumps from values on the order of @xmath312 to much larger values , on the order of @xmath376 .",
    "this indicates that the constant @xmath310 in formula ( [ just ] ) might have a discontinuous dependence on @xmath331 as @xmath331 approches @xmath373 ; this phase transition between the case of no memory ( @xmath354 ) to that of long memory @xmath377 ) is presumably due to a jump in the value of kl elements as @xmath331 approaches @xmath373 .",
    "this could lead to a method for determining whether long memory is present , but in the case of iv asymptotics it would be constrained by liquidity considerations .",
