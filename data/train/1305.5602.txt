    "a class of solar energetic particle ( sep ) events , which are associated with  impulsive \" x - ray flares and type - iii radio bursts , show distinct enhancement of @xmath0 ratio and in some cases high - z elemental abundance ( e.g. , @xmath1he and fe ) .",
    "such energetic electrons and heavy ions are believed to be originated from flaring active regions ( ars ) , separating from large coronal mass ejection ( cme ) and shock - related  gradual \" events @xcite .",
    "apart from the irreducible requirement of a western hemisphere ar where magnetic and plasma processes preferentially energize and release particles @xcite , we still do not clearly identify the solar source of the impulsive sep events .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite proposed that jets seen in extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) and sometimes in white - light ( wl ) images are closely related to the @xmath1he - rich sep events .",
    "the jets may be explained as expanding loops reconnecting with large - scale unipolar magnetic fields @xcite , which are open to interplanetary space for energetic particles to be observed at 1 au .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found some unusual cases of @xmath1he - rich sep events are associated with narrow and fast cmes , making the source identification more complex . a possibility is suggested that particles are accelerated close to the jets or plasmoids , which move upward from magnetic reconnection sites and might appear as faint and narrow cmes in coronagraphs @xcite . these recent progresses in identifying the solar source still leave unsolved questions : do the jets or cmes in association with the impulsive sep events play a critical role in particle acceleration @xcite ?",
    "how does the magnetic topology in the source region relate solar activities to the in - situ sep dynamics @xcite ? to answer the questions , careful comparison of in - situ particle measurements and remote - sensing solar observations , as well as the modeling of coronal magnetic fields should be carried out .    in this study",
    "we present a cross - disciplinary investigation of the impulsive sep events observed on 2007 january 24 , by using energetic electron data to constrain the in - situ sep dynamics ( for instance , timing and distribution ) , which are much more accurate than with low - energy ion data , and the multi - wavelength imaging data to detect the details of the solar activities .",
    "we also apply the velocity map , magnetogram and the potential - field extrapolation to interpret the magnetic morphology in the source region .",
    "our purpose is to clarify the links between jet eruption , coronal magnetic topology , and the production of interplanetary electron streams .",
    "two successive electron events were observed on 2007 january 24 by the wind three - dimensional plasma and energetic particles instrument @xcite and the electron , proton , and alpha monitor @xcite on board advanced composition explorer ( ace ) , both are orbiting the sun - earth l1 liberation point .",
    "the wind/3dp provides electron measurements with the electrostatic analyzers ( eesas ) from @xmath2 0.5 to 28 kev , and with the solid - state telescopes ( ssts ) from 27 to @xmath2 300 kev which suffered a data gap during the events . compensating for the data gap , the ace / epam measures electrons with the composition aperture ( ca )",
    ", whose look direction is oriented 60@xmath3 from the spacecraft spin axis and so is known as the ca60 telescope , in the energy range of 38 @xmath4 315 kev .",
    "figure 1 shows the electron intensity profiles observed from @xmath2 1 to @xmath2 300 kev by the wind/3dp and ace / epam instruments , respectively shown in panel ( a ) and ( b ) , together with the goes soft x - ray ( sxr ) @xmath5 light curve shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "two successive flux enhancements , marked as event 1 and event 2 , were recorded .",
    "both events show clear velocity dispersion ( injection and peak times are later for lower energies ) , which are the typical identifications of their solar origin .",
    "they correspond to the impulsive b5.5 and b7.3 flares , respectively , which were erupted from ar 10939 in the west hemisphere .",
    "when the flares occurred , the position of this ar was roughly at s06w60 nearby to the footpoints of interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) lines connecting the sun to the near - earth space , facilitating energetic particles escape to the in - situ spacecraft .",
    "the larger b9.1 flare , even though accompanied by a relatively speaking fast ( projection speed of 785 km / s ) and wide ( angular width of @xmath6 ) cme , was produced by a eastern ar located at s04e110 , too far from the well - connected region , therefore was not related to a sep event .    since there were severe data gaps of solar imaging observations in the time window of event 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two events show many similarities between them ( see discussion in section 5 ) .",
    "therefore , we mainly focus on the event 2 in the following study . to determine the solar release time ,",
    "assuming electrons travel along the imf lines at a speed of @xmath7 in energy channel @xmath8 with no scattering @xcite , we apply a linear fit to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the imf path length from the acceleration site on the sun to the in - situ spacecraft , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rise time of electron flux at 1 au and the release time at the sun in energy channel @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then the extrapolated electron solar release time @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is 05:19 ut @xmath15 5 minutes , and the inferred imf path length @xmath10 is 1.3 @xmath15 0.2 au . to further confirm this evaluation , adapting the solar wind speed of @xmath2 380 km / s during this event",
    ", the imf path length is calculated by solution of the imf equation deduced from the solar wind model @xcite to be @xmath2 1.19 au . taking @xmath7 to be @xmath2 0.5@xmath16 in the ace / epam energy channel @xmath8 of 60 kev , this channel leads to a lower bound on the electron solar release time @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable since electrons actually undergo interplanetary scattering more or less , then the electron solar release time is derived to be @xmath2 05:20 ut .",
    "the results are consistent with the previous evaluation .    to understand the anisotropy of the in - situ energetic electrons requires an examination of particles transport direction relative to the magnetic field .",
    "the low energy foil spectrometer oriented at 60@xmath3 to the spin axis ( lefs60 ) of the ace / epam provides measurements of electron fluxes in 8 angular sectors , whose spatial orientations projected onto the unit sphere are shown in the left panel of figure 2 .",
    "the magnetic field vector at the peak time of electron fluxes around 05:55 ut is obtained from the ace / mag in a geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate .",
    "then the electron pitch - angle distribution ( pad ) is derived and shown in the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "the letters correspond to the 8 angular sectors in the 42 @xmath4 65 kev channel .",
    "the distribution is normalized and plotted against the pitch - cosine . except for the uncertainty of sector c",
    ", we characterize the strong anisotropic electrons as beam - like when they are detected streaming mainly along the opposite direction of the imf .",
    "therefore , the in - situ energetic electrons are probably accelerated in a confined site on the sun , e.g. , flaring ar , rather than a wide - spread cme - driven shock , and the open - field lines streamed along by energetic electrons connect the spacecraft to the acceleration region in a negative polarity .",
    "to identify the solar source of the beam - like energetic electrons , we first study the full - disk 195 @xmath17 images from the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope @xcite , as well as the wl observations from the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph @xcite on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) . as shown in figure 3 ,",
    "two western ars were responsible for the noticeable coronal activities in the time window of the electron event : ar 10938 , located at the far west limb , produced a faint cme with an angular width of @xmath18 and a projection speed of 295 km / s .",
    "ar 10939 , located at s06w63 and marked by the red box , produced an impulsive b7.3 flare and a jet which probably extended to a few solar radius observed by the lasco c2 coronagraph and marked by the red arrow . by applying running difference to the c2 images ,",
    "the wl jet signature propagates to southwest at an evaluated speed of @xmath2 190 km / s .    to further confirm the origin of the wl jet signature , euv observations with high temporal cadence and spatial resolution are introduced .",
    "figure 4 shows the development of a jet eruption from the ar 10939 . in panel",
    "( a ) , the 171 @xmath17 image at the peak time of the b7.3 flare is obtained from the transition region and coronal explorer @xcite . to enhance the spatial structure",
    ", we apply a high - pass filter by subtracting a smoothed image from the original one .",
    "the hard x - ray ( hxr ) source is reconstructed by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager @xcite and co - aligned with the trace data .",
    "red contour lines indicate the 25 @xmath4 50 kev nonthermal bremsstrahlung source integrated from 05:16 to 05:17 ut .",
    "it is found the hxr source is located in a compact flaring region where the jet erupted nearby to the eastern large - scale loop structure .",
    "panels ( b ) @xmath4 ( d ) consist of running - difference images illustrating the jet evolution . the euv jet propagates to southwest at an evaluated speed of @xmath2 205 km / s during 05:16 to 05:25 ut .",
    "a simple estimation of the spatial and temporal correlation suggests that the wl jet signature is the counterpart of the euv jet erupted from ar 10939 .",
    "the velocity of the jet slightly decreased at @xmath2 3@xmath19 .",
    "the jet was also observed by the euv imaging spectrometer @xcite onboard the @xmath20 satellite . a raster scan using @xmath21 slit",
    "was performed with the eis from 05:22 to 05:44 ut .",
    "the jet signature is seen in the 255.95 @xmath4 256.64 @xmath22 intensity map in the left panel of figure 5 .",
    "the waveband consists of the main emission line he ii peaked at 256.32 @xmath22 and a blended one si x at 258.37 @xmath22 .",
    "we do a 2-component gaussian fit and decompose it into two intensity maps , respectively shown in the right panel of figure 5 .",
    "the compact flaring region where the jet erupted is shown in both of the two intensity maps .",
    "however , the jet itself is only detected by the hot coronal line si x rather than the cool line he ii , suggesting the jet is actually formed in a coronal site .",
    "the compact flaring region where the jet erupted is further analyzed using the x - ray telescope @xcite onboard the @xmath20 satellite .",
    "figure 6 shows the xrt image in @xmath23 filter whose temperature response peaks at 7 mk .",
    "it is , after co - alignment , overlaid with the magnetic field polarities obtained from the michelson doppler imager @xcite onboard the soho .",
    "the compact flaring region then is identified as a loop - like and cusp structure straddled on the right inversion line .",
    "we also mark the footpoints of open - field lines calculated using the potential - field source - surface model @xcite .",
    "it is derived at 00:04 ut and rotated to 05:22 ut .",
    "the open - field lines are rooted in an area of negative polarity nearby to the jet site .",
    "therefore the jet is probably produced by the reconnection between closed loops straddled on the middle inversion line and the western open - field lines .",
    "based on the above analysis , the jet activity is expected to be closely related to the in - situ energetic electrons . the magnetic configuration , on the other hand , plays a crucial role in triggering jet eruption and guiding energetic particles from the acceleration site to interplanetary space . as shown in figure 6 ,",
    "the magnetogram in the vicinity of ar 10939 is quadrupolar and potentially favorable for jet formation .",
    "it is , however , not possible to simulate a precise coronal magnetic configuration at the solar limb since the projection effect .",
    "the eis velocity map , from another perspective , gives us a clue to understand the magnetic topology .",
    "the redshifted downflows observed in ar corresponding to closed loops are well accepted .",
    "the blueshifted outflows , usually persist at the edges of ars , are variously interpreted as magnetic funnels playing a role in coronal plasma circulation @xcite , expansion of large - scale loops that lie over ars @xcite , and reconnection along qsls representing strong gradients of magnetic connectivity @xcite .    in figure 7 , the eis fe xii emission line velocity map is contoured with the co - aligned mdi magnetogram and sketched with a proposed coronal magnetic topology .",
    "doppler velocities are determined by fitting a gaussian function to the calibrated spectral profile .",
    "blueshifts ( redshifts ) correspond to negative ( positive ) doppler velocities in a range of -25 @xmath4 25 km / s .",
    "black contour lines indicate positive longitudinal magnetic field , and green negative .",
    "the strong blueshifted outflows might be explained by either of the mechanisms aforementioned .",
    "the redshifted area corresponds to closed loops of the ar 10939 marked by the red arcs .",
    "the jet is produced by the reconnection between closed loops and negative open - field lines predicted by the pfss model and marked by the black solid lines , along which accelerated particles escape into interplanetary space be detected by near - earth spacecraft .",
    "note that the in - situ electron pad ( shown in figure 2 ) is consistent with the negative polarities of open - field lines .",
    "a cme lifted off from the ar 10938 is marked by the black dashed lines , which might compress the open - field lines to facilitate reconnection with the closed loops and the jet eruption ( see discussion in section 5 ) .",
    "timing information gives us another clue to relate to the solar source .",
    "figure 8 shows the comparison of electron solar release , jet duration , and the multi - wavelength flare emission .",
    "the electrons are released at the sun at 05:19 ut @xmath15 5 minutes ( see section 2 ) and marked by the orange bar .",
    "the euv jet duration is lasting from 05:16 ut to 05:25 ut ( see section 3 ) and marked by the red bar .",
    "the temporal profiles are shown by goes @xmath24 sxr , rhessi 12 @xmath4 50 kev hxr , and the rstn / learmonth 245 mhz radio emission , respectively .",
    "the wind / waves radio dynamic spectra in the frequency range of 20 khz @xmath4 14 mhz show clear type iii bursts , which are generated by electron beams as they propagate along magnetic field lines from the solar corona to interplanetary medium .",
    "it is evident that the electron solar release has a good temporal correlation with the jet eruption , flare emission and the consequent type iii radio bursts , suggesting a physical link of magnetic reconnection , jet production , energetic radiation , and the particle acceleration .",
    "table 1 summaries the impulsive electron events and west hemisphere solar activities observed on 2007 january 24 .",
    "the well - connected ar 10939 produced three jets identified in euv images from the trace and stereo / euvi , respectively .",
    "the first jet erupted at @xmath2 00:35 ut was associated with a hxr flare detectable from the rhessi and type iii radio bursts from the wind / waves .",
    "it is related to the electron event 1 whose solar release time is deduced at @xmath2 00:37 ut , and consistent with the jet eruption and flare emission .",
    "the second jet erupted at @xmath2 01:15 ut without hxr or radio signature .",
    "no corresponding electron flux enhancement was recorded by the in - situ spacecraft .",
    "the third jet and the closely related electron event 2 are afore comprehensively analyzed .",
    "the limb - side ar 10938 produced two cmes ( obtain from the lasco cme catalog : @xmath25 ) .",
    "the first cme with an angular width of @xmath18 and a projection speed of 295 km / s lifted off at @xmath2 05:13 ut , temporally close to the jet eruption at @xmath2 05:16 ut and the electron solar release at @xmath2 05:19 ut .",
    "we interpret that this cme might either facilitate the reconnection occurrence and jet eruption or further accelerate particles in a higher coronal site via 3d reconnection with the open fields .",
    "the second cme with a even larger angular width of @xmath26 and a higher projection speed of 381 km / s lifted off at @xmath2 15:47 ut , however , was not temporally related to a sep event .",
    "furthermore , no type ii radio bursts were recorded in the time window of the impulsive electron events .",
    "therefore , the jets in association with hxr flares and type iii radio bursts , rather than the slow partial cmes , are the crucial contributors to the interplanetary electron streams .    we combine a wide range of datasets , specifically in - situ electron measurements and remote - sensing solar observations , to investigate the acceleration source of the impulsive electron events .",
    "data analysis show that : ( 1 ) the electron solar release has a good temporal correlation with the jet eruption and the multi - wavelength flare emission , namely sxr , hxr and type iii radio burst .",
    "( 2 ) the jet is originated from a well - connected ar whose magnetic polarity structure favors the eruption , then formed in a coronal site , and extended to a few solar radius .",
    "( 3 ) the pfss modeled open fields are rooted in negative polarities , along which energetic particles escape from the flaring ar to the near - earth space , consistent with the in - situ electron pad .",
    "the results convincingly confirm the viewpoint that the coronal jet is probably a key to understand the production of interplanetary electron streams .",
    "however , many impulsive sep events are not associated with jets or even lacking of x - ray signatures @xcite .",
    "possibly the acceleration takes place in high corona via 3d reconnection or other energize processes .    to be emphasized that the magnetic topology plays a crucial role in triggering jet eruption and guiding particles transport .",
    "based on the velocity map , magnetogram and the potential - field extrapolation , we propose a coronal field configuration relating the impulsive sep event to the solar source .",
    "detailed reconstruction of magnetic fields , unavailable to the present study , should be further introduced to explore this topic .",
    "we are very grateful to the wind/3dp / waves , ace / epam / mag , hinode / eis / xrt , soho / eit / mdi / lasco , stereo / euvi , rstn / learmonth , rhessi , and trace teams for providing the data used in this study .",
