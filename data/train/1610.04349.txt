    "there are algorithms available for quantum computers that solve particular tasks faster than any known deterministic classical algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the quantum efficiency arises from the ability to prepare a superposition of input bit - strings , and _ interfere _ them using the quantum computer in order to produce a meaningful output  @xcite : a process that is not possible with a classical computer .",
    "there has been much foundational interest in theories of reality that go beyond quantum theory , perhaps incorporating quantum theory as a limiting case , or even replacing it in yet - unencountered regimes .",
    "often , one considers a set of fundamental principles ( _ axioms _ ) and uses these to derive quantum theory  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . by testing these foundational principles one can validate quantum theory as a good description of reality ; by relaxing them",
    "one can create _ foil theories _ ( alternatives ) that exhibit contrasting behavior to quantum theory , which might be observable in experimental tests .",
    "in particular , one class of post - quantum theories known as _ box - world _ concerns itself with theories that are more non - local than quantum theory @xcite .",
    "if such non - local states existed , it has been shown that they would make certain tasks involving distributed computing trivial  @xcite .",
    "this unusual computational property of a non - quantum theory motivates us to ask if interferometric computation ( which is possible in quantum theory ) can be extended into other theories . by building on recent work that extends the concept of interference beyond quantum theory  @xcite",
    ", we shall address this question in this article .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the interferometric implementation of the deutsch ",
    "jozsa algorithm  @xcite and grover s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss how to represent this type of algorithm in a generalized setting .",
    "we will then show that they can not be implemented in box - world , but can be extended into quaternionic quantum theory .",
    "finally , we will consider the case of spekkens toy model  @xcite , a classical hidden variable theory , which can be made to exhibit certain aspects of quantum behavior by imposing a restriction on the allowed states of knowledge of the system . in this case",
    ", we find that only with the epistemic restriction is the computation possible , even though non - trivial dynamics are possible in both cases .",
    "* the gpt framework. * we will find it convenient to adopt the framework of generalized probabilistic theories ( gpts ) as presented for instance in  @xcite .",
    "this framework amounts to taking the operational view that a system can be described in terms of the measurements made on it , and the outcomes associated with any given measurement .",
    "the states of the system are then a collection of probability distributions over these measurements .",
    "it is assumed that by knowing the statistics of some finite number of different measurements ( an _ informationally complete set _ ) , one can predict the outcomes of _ any _ measurement made on the system .",
    "these statistics are known as the _ state _ of the system , which can thus be written as a real - valued vector @xmath0 .",
    "likewise , there is a natural dual space of measurement outcome _ effects _ , which are functionals that act on states to give the probability associated with any particular measurement outcome .",
    "effects are written as real - valued ( co-)vector @xmath1 , such that for some outcome @xmath2 associated with effect @xmath3 , the probability that this outcome occurs for a state @xmath0 is given by the inner product @xmath4 .",
    "for example , consider a ( classical ) coin which has either `` heads '' or `` tails '' facing upwards .",
    "the state of the coin may be written as @xmath5{^\\mathrm{t}}$ ] , and the effects associated with heads and tails are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . by inspection , @xmath8 . following a fair toss , the state would be written @xmath9 and the probability of being in heads ( or tails ) is obviously given by @xmath10 .    a more involved example would be to describe the state of the elementary two - level quantum system : the qubit . by knowing the outcome probabilities of measurements associated with the pauli matrices ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , one can fully recreate the state ( i.e.  density matrix in the quantum formalism ) .",
    "thus , within the gpt framework , one can express the qubit state as a real positive vector : @xmath14        in quantum theory , there are restrictions on the probability distributions for the measurements within a state . for instance , a state where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is disallowed because it violates the uncertainty principle .",
    "the uncertainty restriction is very much a property of quantum theory ( following from the cauchy - schwarz inequality applied to a hilbert space  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , because the set of pauli matrices form a mutually - unbiased basis , if any measurement has an outcome which occurs with certainty ( probability  @xmath17 ) , then the outcomes for all other measurements occur according to a uniformly random distribution .",
    "geometrically , the uncertainty principle on a qubit describes a spherical state - space ( set of valid states ) , as illustrated on the lhs of [ fig : ss ] .",
    "it is possible to conceive of alternative theories where this restriction does not hold . _",
    "gbits _ , which form the single - system state - spaces in _ box - world _ , admit any valid probability distribution ( subject to the requirement that all measurements normalize to the same value ) . a gbit composed of three binary measurements",
    "could be written in exactly the same form as the quantum bit ( [ eq:3in2out ] ) , but without the uncertainty principle , its state - space is given by a cube , as illustrated on the rhs of [ fig : ss ] .",
    "finally , we remark that transformations in the gpt framework are linear maps between allowed states . for classical theories ( where there exists a single informationally complete measurement ) , these transformations are exactly the set of stochastic matrices acting on a probability vector , whereas in general they have a slightly more complicated form ( see _ theorem 7 _ in @xcite ) . in all cases , they are real - valued matrices .",
    "reversible transformations take the state - space to itself and are thus the automorphism group of the state - space ( or some subset thereof if there are other restrictions imposed on the theory ) . for example , single - qubit reversible transformations are given by @xmath18 , whereas gbit reversible transformations correspond to the finite group formed by relabelling measurements and measurement outcomes ( e.g.  for three binary measurements , this gives the octahedral group of cubic symmetries ) .    *",
    "spekkens toy theory. * spekkens has presented a classical hidden - variable toy theory that replicates many of the features of quantum theory  @xcite , through the introduction of an _ epistemic restriction _ that restricts states to only contain half the amount of knowledge required to fully determine the hidden variable .",
    "the elementary system in this model consists of four classical possibilities ( i.e.  two bits ) , of which only one bit of information can be known .",
    "we can pictorially represent the four ontic possibilities as @xmath19{./spek / spek1}}}$ ] , @xmath19{./spek / spek2}}}$ ] , @xmath19{./spek / spek3}}}$ ] and @xmath19{./spek / spek4}}}$ ] .",
    "the valid single - bit epistemic states thus consist of two ontic possibilities , and can be divided into three groups of mutually - exclusive pairs : @xmath20{./spek / spek13 } } } , \\ ; { \\raisebox{-0.25em}{\\includegraphics[width=1.1em]{./spek / spek24}}}\\big\\}$ ] , @xmath20{./spek / spek12 } } } , \\ ; { \\raisebox{-0.25em}{\\includegraphics[width=1.1em]{./spek / spek34}}}\\big\\}$ ] and @xmath20{./spek / spek14 } } } , \\ ; { \\raisebox{-0.25em}{\\includegraphics[width=1.1em]{./spek / spek23}}}\\big\\}$ ] which by analogy with quantum theory we label as the @xmath21 outcomes of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . these pairs of states",
    "are naturally associated with measurements that ask which of the two options is consistent with the underlying ontic state .",
    "following any measurement , the ontic state is moved to one of the supported possibilities with equal probability ( preventing the violation of the epistemic principle by making two different measurements in a row ) . from this",
    ", it follows that if a measurement is made on an epistemic state which itself is not one of the outcomes of the measurement ( e.g.  measurement @xmath19{./spek / spek13}}}$ ] vs.  @xmath19{./spek / spek24}}}$ ] made on the state @xmath19{./spek / spek12}}}$ ] ) , then either outcome should occur with equal probability .",
    "although this theory not _ a priori _ part of the gpt framework , it can be naturally extended by taking the convex combination of the statistics of these states  @xcite ( cf .  other treatments in @xcite ) .",
    "the states may then be written in terms of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 statistics , and represented by a vector of the form [ eq:3in2out ] , making it naturally comparable with qubits and three - measurement gbits ( sharing the same effects for these measurements ) .",
    "the set of allowed states can be plotted on cartesian axes , as shown in [ fig : convexspek ] .",
    "the statistics spanned without an epistemic restriction form a tetrahedron , whereas with the epistemic restriction , one has an octahedron ( identical to the convex hull of one - bit stabilizer states  @xcite ) . because transformations in spekkens toy theory correspond to permutations on the hidden variable , for a single bit they are given by the automorphism group of the tetrahedron @xmath25 ; not all of the symmetries of the octahedron are allowed .",
    "in this paper , we shall consider phase as presented in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "the extension of sorkin s hierarchical family of interference patterns  @xcite ) .",
    "phase between possibilities is one of the most remarkable features of quantum theory .",
    "much as how knowing the amplitude of a classical wave is not sufficient to predict how two waves interfere , simply knowing the probability associated with a particular possibility is not in general sufficient to predict the behavior of a quantum system . for example , consider the qubit states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , when measured in the computational basis ( @xmath28 vs.  @xmath29 ) , both states are equally likely to give either outcome .",
    "however when a hadamard gate @xmath30 is applied to the two states : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and so afterwards the two states would give opposite answers in the computation basis with certainty .    for quantum theory in general , for some basis @xmath33 , all states of the form @xmath34 for @xmath35 with fixed values of @xmath36 will have the same statistics with respect to the @xmath33 measurement for all values of @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , any transformation of the form @xmath38 will not alter the @xmath33 statistics .",
    "transformations of this kind are known as _ phase operations _ , and in quantum theory , it is as pertinent to consider the set of of allowed unitary matrices of this form as it is the set of allowed values of @xmath39 in @xmath40 , as one can generate a state with arbitrary @xmath39 values from some reference state , and free choice of the operation @xmath41 .",
    "this concept can be extended to the gpt framework as follows  @xcite :    [ def : phase ] a transformation @xmath42 is a _ phase operation _ associated with a measurement @xmath43 if it never alters the statistics associated with @xmath43 , such that : @xmath44 for every effect @xmath45 associated with @xmath43 , and every state @xmath0 admitted in the theory .    in the case of the reversible transformations ,",
    "the phase restriction induces a sub - group of transformations which we refer to as the _ phase group_.    as we shall be interested in _ branching interferometers _",
    "( e.g.  the mach",
    " zehnder interferometer in [ fig : mzi ] ) , we need an operational method of identifying whether a particular transformation can be implemented on a particular branch .",
    "if we imagine some element that might be added to a branch ( for instance , a piece of glass altering the optical path - length ) which does not cause the particle to jump between branches , then this naturally corresponds to an element of the phase group of the system with respect to the `` which branch ? ''  measurement ( we will label this @xmath24 by convention ) .",
    "however , it is not _ a priori _ obvious if every transformation in this group can be induced by an action taken local to one particular branch . in quantum theory , one might by convention associate @xmath46 with an action taken on branch @xmath2 , which when spanned across all @xmath47 in one branch forms a subgroup of the @xmath48 phase group .",
    "this form guarantees that an action taken on , say , branch @xmath17 does not induce a phase difference between remote branches @xmath49 and @xmath50 ; only for a two - branch system are the two groups are identical , due to the global @xmath51 phase freedom . as the above form",
    "does not obviously generalize beyond hilbert spaces , we will use the following operational concept to identify the local subgroups  @xcite :    [ def : bl ] a transformation @xmath52 can be localized to branch @xmath2 if it does not alter any states that have no probability of being in branch @xmath2 . for position measurement effect @xmath53 associated with branch @xmath2 , where @xmath54 is an arbitrary state with no support on branch  @xmath2 :",
    "@xmath55    any @xmath42 that satisfies this for branch @xmath2",
    "may be said to be _",
    "localizable _ to branch @xmath2 ; though this does not imply that @xmath42 can _ only _ be localized to @xmath2 ; for example , the identity element @xmath56 satisfies branch locality for all branches in every theory .",
    "it is shown in [ app : blqt ] that [ def : bl ] implies the conventional quantum form written in [ eq : quantumbl ] .",
    "this is a _ locality _ restriction , because it captures an intrinsic quality of something being `` over here '' instead of `` over there '' ( cf .",
    "`` non - locality '' in the context of chsh - bell violation  @xcite , which concerns itself with the impossibility of quantum _ local realism _ ) . without branch locality",
    ", one would find it conceptually very difficult to ever isolate an experiment from the rest of the universe : every action taken _ everywhere _ would have to be taken into account in order to predict the outcomes of an experiment .",

    "we will make the assumption that all theories we consider are _ operational _ such that there is a method of preparing any state in the state - space , and that all statistics required to specify the state of the system can be extracted by some kind of measurement ( if the experiment is repeated enough times ) .",
    "this broadly amounts to abstracting away the initial and final beamsplitters ( as well as the measurement device ) and instead focusing our attention on the central region where the branches are spatially disjoint .    in order to execute the algorithm ( for @xmath66 bits over @xmath82 branches )",
    ", we suggest that the following criteria are required :    a.   for every @xmath84 , there must be at least two choices of transformations @xmath85 and @xmath86 that can be applied locally to branch @xmath76 , which may be associated with @xmath67 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "b.   there must be some effect @xmath88 such that when the output state @xmath89 is measured , @xmath90 if @xmath62 is constant , and @xmath91 if @xmath62 is balanced , for at least one input state @xmath92 chosen independently of @xmath62 .",
    "requirement i frames the set - up in the context of a _ distributed computation _ : one could imagine @xmath82 independent agents , each of which who calculates @xmath58 locally , and chooses a phase plate to add to their branch based on the result of their calculation .",
    "the transformation induced by the phase - plate put in by agent @xmath76 does not depend on the outcomes of @xmath93 obtained by the other agents , but might be dependent on which branch the agent is in , allowing all of the values of @xmath58 to be computed in parallel .",
    "for example , in quantum theory if @xmath94 , agent @xmath95 might put in a piece of glass that induces the operation @xmath96 , whereas when @xmath97 , agent @xmath98 puts in a piece of glass inducing the different operation @xmath99 .",
    "crucially , we require that the transformation induced by each agent is compatible with _ branch locality _ on that branch .",
    "requirement ii captures the deterministic - interferometry aspect of the algorithm : there must be a single measurement that determines whether @xmath62 is constant or balanced .",
    "a slightly looser version would require there to be a @xmath88 such that @xmath100 if @xmath62 is constant , and @xmath101 if @xmath62 is balanced , such that the two classes of @xmath62 may ultimately be distinguished by enough repetitions of the experiment .    * quantum theory. * as expected , quantum theory is compatible with both requirements . in general , an agent @xmath76 can implement @xmath102 if @xmath67 and @xmath103 otherwise .",
    "transformations of this form are compatible with branch locality ( proven explicitly in [ app : blqt ] ) , and can be composited in any order ( the operations are all diagonal in the same basis ) such that the overall effect of all the agents is to induce the operation @xmath104 . by preparing the initial state @xmath105 , one can perform a final measurement in the @xmath106 basis ( i.e.  by applying @xmath83 followed projecting into @xmath107 ) .",
    "this has probability of a positive outcome given by @xmath108 .",
    "as @xmath87 contributes a term @xmath109 and @xmath67 contributes @xmath110 , we see that @xmath111 when @xmath62 is constant as the global sign does not matter , and @xmath112 for any balanced @xmath62 because half the addends will cancel out the other half .",
    "* classical theory. * on the other hand , classical theory does not permit this algorithm , but rather fails at requirement i since it does not admit any non - trivial ( i.e.  other than @xmath56 ) phase transformations  @xcite , and so @xmath113 always .",
    "there will therefore be no way to encode any measurable information about @xmath62 through actions taken on the separate branches , and so the final measurement will only depend on the initial state @xmath92 .    * box - world. * by these criteria , we can also confirm the suggestion made in @xcite that such an interference algorithm can not be implemented in box - world as a distributed computation - controlled - not gate will not be an allowed transformation , according to the restrictions on correlating dynamics shown in  @xcite ] ( failing criterion i ) when the position measurement is taken to be one of the gbit measurements that allows for complete freedom in selecting the other measurement statistics .",
    "this is because _ no _ transformation can be localized to _ any _ subset of branches ( proven for the general case in  @xcite ) without violating branch locality in some way , and so the agents on the separate branches have no way of encoding the outcome of @xmath58 .",
    "let us see this explicitly for the @xmath114 case , where the `` which - branch ? ''",

    "thus , the @xmath22-flip operation can not be applied branch locally at @xmath119 .",
    "similar logic rules it out localization to @xmath121 , and hence we see that although @xmath22-flip is in the global phase group , it can not be assigned to either branch .",
    "the only remaining group element is @xmath56 , and this does nothing , and hence the localizable phase dynamics are trivial .    if it were possible to apply @xmath56 and @xmath22-flip from each branch , then the algorithm could be performed as an interferometric computation .",
    "however , as they can not , such a calculation can only be done by global phase , in which @xmath56 is applied globally if the function is constant , and @xmath22-flip if it is balanced ( and then @xmath124 such that @xmath125 could satisfy criterion ii ) .",
    "this effectively reduces the problem to a trivial oracle that answers the question `` is the function constant or balanced ?

    "processes that induce phase shifts in an intrinsically non - branch - local way ( such as by the aharonov ",

    "one can prepare the quaternionic superposition state @xmath152 ( much like in complex quantum theory ) , and the action of the agents over the @xmath145 branches will be to introduce phase of @xmath151 in front of either all , none or exactly half of these terms . because of the @xmath118 global phase , the two balanced functions will result in operationally indistinguishable states ; and in general , any function @xmath62 could be replaced by its negation without changing the statistics output by the interferometer .",

    "it would thus be disingenuous if all balanced functions resulted in the same statistics . ] .",
    "finally , we must argue for the existence of a quaternionic beamsplitter whose effect is to sum together all these terms .",

    "no single measurement can distinguish between these two cases , and one would have to perform complete tomography on the state ( hence identifying @xmath62 ) before one could say if @xmath62 were constant or balanced .",
    "this fails even the weaker version of requirement ii : no single effect has @xmath160 if and only if @xmath62 is constant .",
    "one might interpret this as there being a complete lack of global phase in the ontic state - space , such that the action on one branch can not cancel out with the action taken on another ( cf .",

    "the state - space is now subject to a quantum - like uncertainty principle such that if the outcome of @xmath24 is known with certainty , no degrees of freedom remain .",

    "however , because of the epistemic restriction , this violation can never be observed .",
    "a similar phenomenon can be observed in another famous hidden variable theory : bohmian mechanics  @xcite . in bohmian mechanics",
    "it is possible  @xcite to construct a set - up involving an entangled pair of particles entering stern ",
    "gerlach devices at two different positions in space , such that if the exact initial position of the one of the particles was known , at one detector it would be possible to determine from the final trajectory taken by the particle whether or not a measurement had made by the remote detector , violating no - signalling .",
    "however , because knowing the initial position is forbidden , this violation is avoided by an epistemic restriction .",
    "a classical search to find one record in an unordered database containing @xmath145 entries requires on average @xmath165 queries , whereas grover s algorithm  @xcite provides a quantum method which can determine this after @xmath166 queries .",
    "much like the deutsch  jozsa algorithm , one can implement the grover algorithm without recourse to entanglement by building a sufficiently large single - system set - up  @xcite .",
    "in such a set - up , one passes a single particle through a series of beamsplitters such that it is in a superposition over all @xmath145 branches .",
    "these @xmath145 branches are connected to the database , which could be thought of as @xmath145 black boxes , one containing a phase plate that induces a @xmath80 phase shift , and the rest do not change the phase . the database could be thought of as a function @xmath167 where @xmath67 for only one value of @xmath76 , and @xmath87 otherwise .",
    "following this , the output branches are passed through a second beamsplitter , and an additional phase - shift of @xmath80 is added to the first branch only .",
    "this entire process is repeated @xmath168 times , after which it is highly likely ( @xmath169 ) that the particle will be in the branch corresponding to where the @xmath80 phase plate is .",
    "much like the many - branch implementation of fixed vs.  balanced problem , a larger number of optical components are required to prepare the superposition states of an @xmath145 level system . however , if the resource to be minimized is the number of times the database can be probed ( e.g.  because it is far away , or charges per access ) , then the @xmath145-branch implementation ( as opposed to the qubit implementation ) of this algorithm is just as efficient .",
    "the unordered search addressed by grover s algorithm is slightly less straightforward to classify than the constant vs.  balanced problem .",
    "certainly , we will still need requirement @xmath2 to be true in order to build our database ; in this case the function @xmath62 is no longer constant or balanced , but rather guaranteed to only be @xmath17 for one value of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , every theory which failed on this requirement ( classical bits , boxworld ) will also be unable to provide the coherent oracle required for grover s algorithm . in the box - world case , as with the constant vs.  balanced problem",
    ", one can only find admit a `` global oracle '' which trivially sets the state such that it flags the correct value of @xmath76 satisfying @xmath67 ) .",
    "on the other hand , quaternionic quantum theory admits all the components required ( local phase - shifts and beamsplitters ) , which will work in the same way as in quantum theory , and so should allow an implementation of grover s algorithm .",
    "by treating spatial degrees of freedom in the generalized probabilistic theories , we have seen that interferometric computation can be extended beyond quantum theory .",
    "the usefulness of a theory was shown to be very much reliant on the structure of available dynamics .",
    "in particular , locality considerations dictate whether the process can be interpreted as a distributed computation performed by many agents .",
    "we ruled out box - world as the dynamics could not be localized to different branches , and so the only interferometric solution to either the constant vs.  balanced or the unordered search problems would require a trivial oracle that directly answers the question .",
    "on the other hand , in theories with interesting dynamics interferometric computation is once more possible . in complex and quaternionic quantum theory , which both contain a non - trivial unmeasurable global phase group that is also contained within every branch local subgroup",
    ", we saw that it is possible for the agents to act on separate branches in such a way that both of the constant functions produce the same operational output state .",
    "finally , when we considered spekkens toy hidden variable model , we found that the computation was made possible explicitly by the imposition of an uncertainty principle , which censored the measurement of non - local behavior in the underlying underlying state , in a manner that is similar to the censorship of locality violations arising from hidden variables in bohmian mechanics .",

    "when @xmath225 is a diagonal matrix where every diagonal element is @xmath17 except for @xmath237 , branch locality will therefore automatically be respected for density matrices with @xmath61s in row @xmath140 and column @xmath140 .",
    "hence , we can associate this choice of @xmath238 with that branch .    unlike with quantum theory",
    ", the global phase freedom for quaternions can not be the same @xmath147 phase freedom available to each branch : for @xmath239 , application of the global phase @xmath240 gives @xmath241 , which amounts to conjugating every element in @xmath174 with @xmath242 . because quaternions do not commute , in general this will have a non - trivial effect on @xmath174 ( even if @xmath242 is restricted to a complex number ) .",
    "only the real elements of @xmath147 , which correspond to @xmath243 , commute and thus are never observable globally .",
    "hence only @xmath118 can be taken as global phase operations which have no effect on any observable state ( see also lemma 33 and discussion in appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "this works to our advantage : unlike a complex global phase , a quaternionic global phase would cause us problems with commutativity : if two spatially disjoint agents could both act to span the entire phase - group of a quaternionic two - level system , then relativistic observers might disagree on what the resultant transformation should be , and this would ultimately conflict with the objective reality associated with probabilistic clicks in the detector  @xcite . without a quaternionic global phase , branch locality can divide the quaternionic phase group up into subgroups , each of which with elements that commute with all elements in the other subgroups .",
    "( the @xmath244 case is discussed in the appendix of @xcite , where the two phase groups end up corresponding to the left and right isoclinic rotations in @xmath245 , and the only shared element other than identity corresponds to the inversion @xmath246 , which is what we require for our interferometric computation . )"
