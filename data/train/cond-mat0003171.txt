    "the first quantity we discuss , shown in fig .",

    "these results suggest that @xmath95 could be the roughening temperature , @xmath9 , for the osgm and @xmath96 the superroughening temperature , @xmath97 , for the rsgm , because the ew behavior of the mean energy of both models indicates the effective suppresion of the sine term by temperature .",

    "[ fig2 ] presents the specific heat , @xmath98 , of both models , exhibiting a well defined peak in @xmath98 for the osgm with its maximum at temperature @xmath99 , much lower than @xmath95 .",

    "furthermore , we believe that this peak is a ( schottky ) _ anomaly _ @xcite similar to that observed in 2d xy and easy - plane heisenberg spin models @xcite _ above _ the kt transition . recall that when mapping the osgm to the xy model the temperature of the former maps to the inverse temperature of the latter @xcite , hence the observation of the anomaly below the possible transition temperature @xmath95 .",
    "this reinforces our interpretation of @xmath95 as the roughening temperature of the osgm .",
    "the total roughness of both models , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , behaves similarly for temperatures higher than @xmath95 , depending linearly on temperature . in both cases , we see that the slope of the roughness depends on the system size , as predicted by eq .",

    "the slope of the linear region is approximately the same in the first part , from @xmath96 to @xmath95 , and in the second , above @xmath95 , i.e. , the whole linear region is well described by the ew model .",
    "this means that above @xmath95 the linear model describes accurately the behavior of the osgm , and hence from now on we identify @xmath95 with the roughening temperature @xmath9 , whereas for the rsgm , the same is true of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    ", @xmath102 exhibits a very clear peak at @xmath9 , and above @xmath9 it is the same as for the rsgm ; however , this magnitude is very noisy and these results must be taken with caution .",
    "in fact , one could identify a peak for the rsgm at @xmath97 , but different realizations lead to different results , in contrast with the peak for the osgm , which is the same for all realizations . below @xmath9 , the values of @xmath104 for the osgm are independent of the system size , whereas above @xmath9 they increase with size without any definite scaling .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] depicts the height - difference correlation function for the two studied models , and shows that above @xmath105 and @xmath106 they behave as predicted by the linear theory : the slope of the numerical height - difference correlation function is @xmath107 , indistinguishable from the predicted @xmath108 by eq .",
    "( [ crew2d ] ) .",
    "in addition , the correlation functions for the osgm and the rsgm coincide , as shown in the plot for the rsgm .",
    "we see that the behavior of the correlation functions is in full agreement with our claims regarding @xmath9 and @xmath97 , and this is further confirmed by the plot of the slope correlation function in fig .",
    "it is important to note that , below @xmath97 , the behavior of the height difference correlation function for the rsgm is approximately a squared logarithm , as predicted by rg calculations .",

    "the results for both models are again indistinguishable for temperatures above @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath110 is largely independent not only of the system size , but also on the realization of the quenched disorder for the rsgm .",
    "we now turn to the question of the influence of the potential strength on the rsgm behavior .",
    "we have considered two representative values , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , i.e. , five times smaller and larger , respectively , than the `` canonical '' value @xmath32 .",
    "the smallest value is close to that considered in @xcite , @xmath113 , and we expect that our results will be comparable to theirs . as before , we begin by discussing the total roughness and the specific heat ( see fig .  [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "first of all , for all values of @xmath14 there is a temperature above which the roughness value is independent of @xmath14 and of the presence or absence of disorder .",
    "this means that our identification of this regime with the effective suppresion of any potential effect is indeed correct : different @xmath14 leads only to different transition temperatures .",
    "thus , for the osgm we find @xmath114 and @xmath115 , in agreement with the intuitive expectation that larger potentials need higher temperatures to be suppressed . aside from this",
    ", the general shape of the roughness curve is basically the same for the three values of @xmath14 .",
    "the situation ( for the osgm ) is the same as far as the specific heat is concerned : larger ( smaller ) @xmath14 leads to larger ( smaller ) anomalies , which are displaced to higher ( lower ) @xmath22 following the corresponding @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that changing @xmath14 does not introduce anything qualitatively new in the osgm .",
    "the picture for the rsgm is substantially different : modifying @xmath14 does give rise to qualitatively new phenomena .",
    "let us first look at the small @xmath14 case .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows that the roughness follows a straight line all the way down to @xmath116 ( although we can not exclude that there are nonlinear effects for @xmath117 with our present resolution ) .",
    "this would suggest that there is no transition in this case , very much like the results of batrouni and hwa @xcite .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , where the height difference correlation function is depicted , confirms this interpretation , showing no dependence on temperature in the analyzed range ; fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , for @xmath110 , agrees with this as well , in so far as the dependence of @xmath110 on temperature is well described by the high temperature expansion . in view of this , we can conclude that if there is a transition , it occurs at a temperature smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "finally , let us consider the large @xmath14 case , @xmath112 .",
    "the plot of the roughness in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] exhibits a striking peak for @xmath119 , after which the roughness decreases until reaching the high temperature regime ( marked by the corresponding osgm with the same value for @xmath14 ) at @xmath120 . to assess the relevance of this peak in the roughness , we repeated our simulations for @xmath101 and performed additional ones for @xmath86 .",
    "the results , collected in fig",
    ".  [ fig14bis ] , show that the peak is a realization dependent feature .",
    "however , in this plot we also see that for temperatures below @xmath119 the roughness is roughly independent of the system size , something which we did not observe when @xmath32 ( the lines for @xmath32 are included in fig .",
    "[ fig14bis ] again for comparison ) . hence , even if the peak at @xmath119 does not actually exist , that temperature does seem to separate two different regions .",
    "in addition , for @xmath112 the specific heat has a ( more smeared ) maximum at about the same temperature as that of the roughness , although our data are much noisier and we can not establish clearly the maximum temperature ; the dependence , however , is manifestly non - monotonic .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] supports our conclusion that @xmath121 , whereas nothing special is seen as @xmath110 goes through @xmath119 , the roughness maximum .",
    "the most intriguing result is the one in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for the height difference correlation function : for @xmath122 , the scaled correlations decrease with temperature but , simultaneously , the correlation length increases , up to @xmath119 , when it increases beyond the system size . above that temperature",
    ", it follows the same evolution as the @xmath32 case , finally reaching @xmath123 . whereas in this intermediate temperature regime",
    "the height difference correlation functions are well described by squared logarithms , fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] immediately shows that the lowest temperature correlations can by no means be considered squared logarithms .",
    "this suggest the presence of a new phase transition at @xmath124 .",
    "we will discuss the possible nature of the low temperature phase and the existence of this transition in the next section .",
    "we now generalize the rsgm and let @xmath4 to be randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in @xmath17 $ ] , with @xmath125 ; @xmath33 is the case studied in the preceding section . as representative examples",
    "we have considered @xmath126 and @xmath127 , closer to the rsgm and the osgm , respectively . from the roughness dependence on temperature , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we see that for both values of @xmath31 the dependence of the roughness on temperature is qualitatively similar to the osgm , the results for the lower @xmath31 value being practically the same as for the @xmath128 case",
    ". however , the case @xmath126 is somewhat different : the low temperature region appears to consist of two straight lines , changing slope at a temperature around @xmath129 , rather than a nonlinear dependence . by reasoning as above , we identify @xmath130 and @xmath131 , values which are confirmed by the energy behavior ( not shown ) , the height difference ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) and slope ( not shown ) correlation functions , and by the dependence of @xmath110 on temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "an interesting question arises from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] : there is no evidence about the squared logarithmic behavior found for the rsgm and , furthermore , the plots exhibit a finite correlation length below @xmath97 for both values of @xmath31 .",
    "another intriguing fact is the nonmonotonic dependence of the correlation function on temperature for @xmath126 : from the curve for @xmath132 , the scaled correlation function decreases up to @xmath119 ; upon further increasing the temperature , the evolution of the curves is very similar to that of the osgm .",
    "this might be connected with the change in slope in the roughness curve mentioned in the preceding paragraph ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) , but we have not been able to draw a clearer connection . all this is clear evidence that the behavior of the rsgm is significantly dependent on the disorder strength .",
    "let us begin the discussion of the above results by analyzing our findings about the osgm .",
    "our simulations strongly support that @xmath133 for the osgm on a lattice with @xmath32 .",
    "this is in contrast to the claims in @xcite that @xmath134 where a different way of definining the transition , which assumes the validity of the rg approach , was used ( see sec .",
    "iii b and @xcite ) .",
    "further , the result is also in contrast with the rg prediction itself @xcite , which in our units is @xmath135 .",
    "however , we believe that the comparison with the linear theory for the ew high temperature phase has a much more physical character while keeping the basic rg ideas , and establishes beyond doubt that for the studied lattices the roughening temperature is @xmath133 for @xmath32 .",
    "another hint in favor of our claim is the finding of the ( schottky ) anomaly in the specific heat , which should appear below the transition temperature in view of what occurs for the xy and related models @xcite . finally , the fact that we obtain the same results for both the osgm and the rsgm above @xmath9 is clear evidence that the potential is irrelevant ( in the rg sense ) in that regime and that we have indeed located the transition .",
    "clearly , we can not exclude the possibility that working on even larger lattices we would find the transition where the rg predicts it , but the absence of any finite size effects even for @xmath88 makes this possibility quite unlikely .",
    "another possible reason for the discrepancy is the fact that our simulations are intrinsically discrete in space while rg theories for the osgm are always applied to the continuum equation ; again , very much larger lattices would remove this objection and clarify the effects of discreteness . aside from that",
    ", we have also found that increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath14 increases ( decreases ) the roughening temperature : in the cases we studied , we found @xmath136 and @xmath137 , which is intuitively reasonable as larger potential barriers require larger temperatures for the surface to overcome them . on the other hand ,",
    "rg calculations are perturbative in @xmath14 , so one would expect better agreement to the rg prediction for @xmath111 , but in fact the agreement is worse in that case .",
    "let us now turn to the rsgm .",
    "in the `` canonical '' case , @xmath32 , we found a superroughening transition at @xmath138 , to be compared to rg predictions that it should occur at @xmath139 .",
    "below @xmath97 , we have obtained a @xmath16 dependence of the height difference correlation function , in agreement with rg results .",
    "however , we have clearly shown that the superroughening transition temperature depends on @xmath14 , confirming the earlier report by batrouni and hwa @xcite on the absence of the transition in langevin dynamics simulations for @xmath113 , and later reports by rieger @xcite and ruiz - lorenzo @xcite who also observed this dependence in monte carlo simulations . in the opposite case , @xmath112 , we find that @xmath121 , considerably higher than the @xmath32 temperature .",
    "this disagrees with the rg predictions of a universal @xmath97 independent of @xmath14 .",
    "we believe that the agreement between our results and the previous ones @xcite indeed supports a dependence of @xmath97 on @xmath14 , whose explanation remains an open question as far as rg is concerned .    a second",
    ", novel finding arises when considering our numerical results for @xmath112 , which strongly suggest the possibility of two different low temperature phases . in our comments in the preceding paragraph , we took @xmath140 interpreting that the superroughening transition implies a change from a @xmath16 behavior of the height difference correlation function to a @xmath141 form ( and the rest of ew features ) .",
    "however , the lack of size dependence of the roughness and the specific heat on temperature below @xmath124 , with peaks absent for smaller values of @xmath14 , raises the possible existence of another phase transition . if one looks at the correlation functions in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , it turns out that for temperatures below @xmath142 the correlation length is finite , in agreement with the roughness independence on the system size . whereas the range of correlations above @xmath143 , which we believe is infinite , could be a subject of debate",
    "as we only have studied sizes up to @xmath88 , our claim of finite correlation lengths below @xmath143 is difficult to dispute .",
    "further evidence in this regard is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10bis ] , where curves for @xmath112 at @xmath132 are compared for two different system sizes . at this point , it is interesting to recall that in a previous paper @xcite it was found that at @xmath116 , the rsgm with @xmath32 exhibits a finite correlation length of about 20 lattice units ( the reader may find figs .  2 and 3 of @xcite illustrative ) . having this in mind , it is not unreasonable to conjecture that there is a @xmath143 for the @xmath32 case , which could be below @xmath132 or close to 1 ( the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] might already show a finite correlation length ) .",
    "we stress that this phase has not been previously reported in works at @xmath116 : thus , zeng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a discrete model but , being different from the gaussian , their low temperature results can not be compared to ours , and the results of rieger _",
    "@xcite do not allow to conclude anything in this respect .",
    "intuitively , one can expect a finite correlation length phase at low temperatures and large @xmath14 ; in the limit @xmath144 , the surface follows the disorder ( i.e. , @xmath145 everywhere ) , but the gradient term smoothens out the lack of correlations of @xmath4 , the competition of these two effects yielding a finite correlation length . in a loose sense , this could be interpreted as anderson localization taking over the coupling between neighboring sites with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "this picture is confirmed by simulations for @xmath146 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10bis ] ) : for such a large value of @xmath14 the correlation length is only 1 lattice unit , i.e. , correlations reach only nearest neighbors . clearly , the data presented here is not conclusive , but the conjecture that there are two transitions whose critical temperatures depend on @xmath14 is not unreasonable and deserves further consideration .",
    "we have also found that the transition temperature and the correlation functions depend on the disorder strength .",
    "this is not unexpected , in so far as the change in the disorder distribution interacts with the periodicity of the sine potential , and therefore it is clear that when @xmath33 , i.e. , in the standard rsgm , we are in a special case . in this respect ,",
    "our results appear to indicate that the rsgm ( with @xmath33 ) is a very specific model , and that its behavior at low temperatures might not be representative of what one would find in an actual experiment , where the disorder can not be so precisely controlled .",
    "another conclusion we may draw from our work is that there might be two classes of behavior at low temperatures for small and large @xmath31 : small @xmath31 models would behave very similarly to the osgm , whereas large values of @xmath31 would give rise to a more complex phenomenology with , e.g. , nonmonotonic behavior of the correlation functions .    as a final conclusion ,",
    "we remark that the most relevant result of the present work is the determination of the transition temperature from the high temperature phase to the low temperature phase ( or phases ) of both the osgm and the rsgm .",
    "this poses a number of questions to be addressed either with greater numerical capabilities or with new analytical tools .",
    "we believe that the complex phase diagram of the rsgm is being partially unveiled , as our research supports previous findings such as the non universality of the transition temperature . significantly , once we know where to look for the low temperature phase of the rsgm , we can investigate the nature of that phase ( or phases ) .",
    "it is often stated that the rsgm is `` glassy '' in this regime ; however , this assertion has never been really proven nor fully detailed and , furthermore , if the rg picture is qualitatively correct , it has to be recalled that it is a replica - symmetric theory , which implies that the superrough phase would not be glassy in the replica sense @xcite .",
    "we have obtained preliminary evidence that there are long - lived metastable states in the low temperature phase of the rsgm @xcite , but in view of our present results and their non - universality we will examine this question more carefully in future work .",
    "investigation of the dynamics of the rsgm will also be important ; we recall that batrouni and hwa @xcite did find evidence for a superroughening transition in the dynamics of the model , and hence it would be worth checking their results for larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "we hope that those analyses , along with measurements of nonlinear susceptibilities and of relaxation dynamics , will shed light on this difficult problem .",
