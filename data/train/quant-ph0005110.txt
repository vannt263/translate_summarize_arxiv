    "quantum mechanics is an incredibly successful theory .",
    "no experiment , no observation , has ever given the lie to it .",
    "but if it is not lying , what does it tell us about the world ?",
    "a fairly typical answer is : nothing ; quantum mechanics concerns statistical regularities in the behavior of measuring instruments ; any attempt to go beyond the `` brute facts '' , to give a realistic or epistemological account of how it is that the statistical regularities predicted by quantum mechanics come out the way they do , is idle metaphysics . considering the widely divergent and more or less bizarre accounts that abound , this resigned attitude appears justified .",
    "but is it ?    in this essay",
    "i examine the metaphysical presuppositions that stand in the way of making sense of quantum mechanics and trace them to their neurophysiological underpinnings . because these underpinnings to a considerable extent determine the nature of the phenomenal world and consequently prejudice our thinking about the physical world , rejecting those presuppositions",
    "is no easy task .",
    "but it is worth the effort , for at the end we shall find that the mathematical elegance and simplicity of quantum mechanics is matched by the depth and transparency of its ontological message .",
    "the problem of understanding quantum mechanics is in large measure the problem of finding appropriate ways of thinking about the spatial and temporal aspects of the physical world .",
    "section  2 contrasts the salient features of phenomenal space with the standard mathematical description of physical space .",
    "it is argued that the standard description has empirically unwarranted features that stand in the way of finding the right interpretation .",
    "an alternative , essentially relationalist way of thinking is proposed .    in the sections that follow the relevant empirical findings",
    "are progressively taken into account .",
    "section  3 takes account of the existence of noncomposite entities , a.k.a .",
    "the fundamental particles of matter .",
    "its chief conclusion is that these entities must be thought of as formless .",
    "the still prevalent notion that a fundamental particles has a ( pointlike ) form is an unwarranted ( in fact , illegitimate ) importation from the phenomenal world into the world of physics .",
    "the form of a material object is the set of its internal spatial relations .",
    "an object that lacks internal spatial relations also lacks a form .",
    "section  4 takes account of the behavior of indistinguishable particles .",
    "it is argued that a fundamental particle is not something to which existence is contingently attributable .",
    "the basic reality of matter is a single entity , and this entity can not be qualified as anything more particular or determinate than `` existence itself '' . considered in relation to each other , fundamental particles are instances of `` existence itself '' . considered out of relation to other particles , each fundamental particle is `` existence itself '' . the individuation or multiple instantiation of this entity is discussed .",
    "section  5 takes account of the behavior of electrons in two - slit interference experiments .",
    "this behavior is nature s corroboration of the relationalist conception of physical space developed in secs .  2 and  3 .",
    "it is argued that the standard , substantival , set - theoretic conception of space is as inconsistent with quantum mechanics as absolute simultaneity is with special relativity .",
    "so , therefore , is the doctrine of local realism , the principle of local causality , and the mathematical physicist s golden calf , determinism .    section  6 deals with two frequent mistakes , the error of the instrumentalist , who rejects all efforts to make ontological sense of quantum mechanics , and the error of the quantum realist , who considers probability one sufficient for the existence of an element of reality .",
    "while the instrumentalist errs by ignoring the possibility of a quantum world with extrinsic properties , the quantum realist errs by ignoring that the properties of the quantum world , including the times at which they are possessed , are extrinsic : they `` dangle '' from what happens or is the case in the rest of the world .",
    "the contingent properties of the quantum world exist precisely to the extent that their values are indicated .",
    "section  7 pinpoints the sense in which the relative positions of the world s material constituents are indefinite .",
    "this involves reference to objective probabilities , which can be assigned only to counterfactuals .",
    "the very possibility of assigning objective probabilities to the possible results of an unperformed measurement entails that the possessed values of quantum - mechanical observables are extrinsic .",
    "the extrinsic nature of the world s contingent properties thus follows directly from their indefiniteness .",
    "hence unless we are willing to take seriously the extrinsic nature of quantum - mechanical properties , we shall not be in a position to make proper sense of the indefiniteness that is the hallmark of quantum mechanics , and hence of quantum mechanics itself .    while even a macroscopic object ( defined in sec .",
    "7 ) has a position only because of the facts from which this can be inferred , the dependence of its position on position - indicating facts is a qualitative ( ontological or existential ) dependence , not a quantitative one .",
    "for the quantitative purposes of physics , it is legitimate to ignore this dependence , to consider macroscopic positions as intrinsic , and to apply to them classical causal concepts .",
    "this is fortunate , for otherwise quantum mechanics would be inconsistent , inasmuch as its very formulation presupposes a classical domain of positions that can be thought of as being factual _ per se_. causality nevertheless is emergent ; it is not part of the ontological foundation .",
    "all the determining that goes on in the physical world is the determining of probabilities associated with possibilities .",
    "there are nt any causally determined facts .",
    "the quantum formalism concerns probabilistic correlations among facts  diachronic correlations between facts indicating properties of the same system at different times and synchronic correlations between facts indicating properties of different systems in spacelike separation ,   and it is these correlations that explain why causal explanations work to the extent they do . trying to causally explain the correlations would be putting the cart in front of the horse .",
    "all of this is explained in sec .",
    "the seemingly intractable problem of understanding quantum mechanics is largely due to our obtruding onto the physical world a theoretical framework that is more detailed than the physical world , in that it portraits space and time as infinitely and intrinsically differentiated .",
    "section  9 shows that the physical world is only finitely differentiated spacewise and timewise , namely to the extent that spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by facts . as a consequence",
    ", we can not think of reality as being built `` from the bottom up '' , on an infinitely and intrinsically differentiated space , out of locally instantiated physical properties .",
    "instead we must conceive of the physical world as being built `` from the top down '' : by entering into a multitude of spatial relations with itself , `` existence itself '' takes on both the aspect of a spatially differentiated world and the aspect of a multiplicity of relata  the fundamental particles . by allowing the spatial relations to change",
    ", it takes on the further aspect of a temporally differentiated world .",
    "the final section homes in on the idea that is at the root of our interpretational difficulties , traces its philosophical fallout , and examines its neurophysiological underpinnings .",
    "this is the `` cookie cutter paradigm '' , according to which the world s synchronic multiplicity is founded on the introduction of surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three - dimensional cookie cutters .",
    "the problem of understanding quantum mechanics is in large measure the problem of finding appropriate ways of thinking about the spatial and temporal aspects of the physical world .",
    "the way we think about space is obviously indebted to our awareness of phenomenal space , the three - dimensional expanse which contains both sensory percepts ( a.k.a .",
    "qualia or introspectible properties ) and visual images .",
    "one of the things that quantum mechanics is trying to tell us is that the way we are accustomed to think about space is more appropriate for dealing with the spatial aspect of the phenomenal world than it is for dealing with the spatial aspect of the physical world . in the following sections i will successively introduce the relevant empirical data and examine their implications . in the present section i focus on what we can learn by paying attention to our direct awareness of phenomenal space and by contrasting it with the standard mathematical representation of physical space .",
    "physicists routinely represent space as a transfinite set of point individuals in one - to - one correspondence with triplets of real numbers .",
    "this mathematical representation lacks certain features that are vital for interpreting quantum mechanics correctly , and it possesses certain empirically unwarranted features that stand in the way of finding the correct interpretation .",
    "the features that are lacking are the _ quality _ of continuous spatial extension and a _ unity _ that goes beyond the unity of a set , defined by cantor  @xcite as `` a many that allows itself to be thought of as a one '' .",
    "the empirically unwarranted features are the _ multiplicity _ that is inherent in the set @xmath0  of all triplets of real numbers and the _ intrinsic distinctness _ of the members of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the visual image of a line .",
    "this is in an obvious sense continuously extended in one spatial dimension .",
    "if the line is unbounded , we can set up a one - to - one correspondence between the set @xmath1 of real numbers and points on the line ; if it is bounded , we can set up a one - to - one correspondence between any finite interval of @xmath1 and points on the line .",
    "what is important is that these points do not exist in advance of any one - to - one correspondence that we may set up .",
    "they are introduced into the line by our setting up such a correspondence .",
    "the line is in an obvious sense divisible into segments , but nothing in its image warrants the notion that it is intrinsically multiple , let alone that it is a concatenation of point individuals with the cardinality of the real numbers . while between two distinct real numbers @xmath2 , @xmath3 there exists a nondenumerable set @xmath4 of real numbers , between the points that correspond to @xmath2 and @xmath3 there exists a perfectly continuous and intrinsically undifferentiated line segment @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are entirely different things .",
    "@xmath4 possesses something that @xmath5 lacks , namely the multiplicity of a nondenumerable set and the distinctness of its members .",
    "@xmath5 possesses something that @xmath4 lacks , namely the quality of continuous spatial extension and the unity of an intrinsically undivided whole .    unfortunately , we are so accustomed to conflating the continuity of phenomenal space with the discreteness of @xmath0  that it has become almost impossible for us to tease them apart .",
    "we tend to visualize the reals as a continuous line without realizing that the very act of visualization introduces a qualitative element that is not warranted by the mathematical construction of the reals .",
    "conversely , in our attempt to get a conceptual grip on physical space we seize on the reals as a set that appears to contain sufficiently many elements to `` fill '' a continuous line and thus to possess its continuity . we even deprive ourselves of the words that are needed to distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as when we use the adjectives `` continuous '' and `` discrete '' to qualify _ sets_. in what follows , all words starting with the letters will signify ( possession of ) that continuity which is an obvious pre - theoretical feature of our visual percepts and images , and `` discrete '' will refer to that discreteness which is an obvious property of every `` many that allows itself to be thought of as a one '' .",
    "continuity , so defined , is a feature of objects in phenomenal space ( that is , of visual percepts and visual images ) , and it is not a feature of any mathematical set . is continuity a feature of objects in physical space",
    "? encompasses its interior .",
    "neither of these senses is applicable to an unbounded continuous space .",
    "hence if we say of something that it exists or is situated `` in '' space , what we mean is that it is spatially extended , or that it is spatially related to something else , or that it stands out from a spatial expanse like the visual image of a point .",
    "] does it exist in the physical world ?",
    "these questions are quite analogous to the following : does the turquoise of a tropical lagoon exist in physical space ( that is , is it an objective property of the lagoon ) ?",
    "few would venture an affirmative answer .",
    "qualia belong to phenomenal space ; they are correlated with certain physical quantities but are themselves not physical .",
    "but the continuity of phenomenal space is as much a _ qualitative _ feature of our visual percepts as is the sensation of turquoise .",
    "it eludes mathematical description just as definitely as does the color of the lagoon .",
    "one theorist who was acutely aware of this was hermann weyl  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   it ought to be emphasized just how little mathematics can claim to capture the phenomenal [ _ anschauliche _ ] nature of space : nothing in geometry concerns what makes phenomenal space what it distinctively _ is_  .",
    "our conceptual theories are capable of penetrating only one aspect of space , and only the most superficial and formal at that . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a triplet of real numbers is not the same as a point .",
    "the difference between two real numbers is not the same as the distance between two points .",
    "distances possess , in addition to their values , a purely qualitative aspect , and nobody lacking our pre - mathematical grasp of phenomenal space is in a position to know it , anymore than mary , confined from birth to a black - and - white room , was in a position to know color  @xcite .",
    "it might be concluded that we should think of continuity in the same way as we think of color sensations  as an appearance or a secondary quality , rather than as an actual feature of the physical world : continuity is a property of percepts and images in phenomenal space ; the real thing , physical space , is discrete and cardinally equal to @xmath0 .",
    "however , in view of the interpretational difficulties associated with quantum mechanics , it may be worth a try to consider the continuity we find in phenomenal space , and the undifferentiated unity that goes with it , as objective features of the physical world , and to determine how , this being so , the multiplicity of @xmath0  and the distinctness of its members relate to the physical world .",
    "it is worth noting , to begin with , that if we conceive of physical space as a set of points corresponding one - to - one to the members of @xmath0 , the individual points of space are not visualizable .",
    "if we imagine a point , we imagine something that stands out from an otherwise undifferentiated spatial expanse .",
    "if we think of this point as one of the points of space , then this particular point of space possesses a quality that is not present at those points of space that make up the surrounding expanse .",
    "hence what we imagine is not a point of space but this quality situated or instantiated at a particular point of space .",
    "in other words , what we imagine is a pointlike _",
    "object_. we can visualize pointlike objects , but we can not visualize an individual point of space .",
    "the points of space are not objects but nonvisualizable _ positions _ at which visualizable objects may be situated or visualizable qualities may be instantiated .",
    "positions in phenomenal space can only be defined relatively , as spatial relations that hold among visual percepts or images .",
    "we have neither empirical nor theoretical reasons to doubt that the same is true of physical space : positions are relatively defined , as spatial relations that hold either among material objects or among the points of space .",
    "the latter alternative , however , introduces into the physical world a spatial multiplicity and a degree of spatial differentiation that not only are empirically unwarranted but also violate the identity of indiscernibles , a principle of analytic ontology which says that two things can not have exactly the same properties . since no objective differences correspond to the differences between the triplets of real numbers by which we label the points of space , these points have identical properties and therefore can not be thought of as distinct individuals .",
    "the points of space being positions at which material objects may be situated or physical qualities may be instantiated , and positions being relatively defined , the points of space are relatively defined .",
    "we do not have , on the one hand , a set of preexistent positions ( cardinally equal to the reals ) and , on the other hand , a set of spatial relations that hold among these positions .",
    "the positions _ are _ the spatial relations , or else they are defined by them : the exist , as distinct locations , by virtue of the distinguishing relations .",
    "the relata owe their existence to the relations , and the relations owe their existence to the material objects or instantiated physical properties to which they are attributable .",
    "it follows that the synchronic multiplicity of the world does not go beyond the multiplicity of material objects ( or locally instantiated physical properties ) existing at any one time , and the multiplicity of their relations .",
    "it does not include the nondenumerable multiplicity of the `` points of space '' .",
    "the function of this multiplicity  the multiplicity of coordinates  is not to label `` vacant '' positions but to quantify the undifferentiated spatial relations that exist between material objects .",
    "( the actually existing spatial relations , which spatially differentiate the world , are not themselves spatially differentiated . )",
    "this is relationism , the doctrine that space is a family of spatial relations holding among the world s material constituents , rather than an additional constituent of the world .",
    "the alternative to relationism is substantivalism . according to the latter",
    ", there is such a thing as `` space itself '' , and this has , by itself , a definite number of dimensions and a metric .",
    "the dimensionality of physical space , however , is fully determined by the system of spatial relations that hold among material objects ; it is the number of coordinates needed to specify those relations .",
    "there is no need to attribute it to a separate constituent of the world .",
    "what about the metric ? this too need not be attributed to a separate constituent of the world . as was pointed out by riemann  @xcite @xcite , unless physical space is inherently discrete ( and therefore a separate constituent of the world with inherent properties ) , metric relations are extrinsic to it . on the relationist view of space ,",
    "metric relations exist only between material objects , and the assignment of values to such relations is based on the behavior of material objects , rather than on properties intrinsic to space . since the behavior of material objects finds formal expression in laws that make reference to distances , it is possible that the metric properties of the world and the laws of physics are individually underdetermined .",
    "what is observable , or factual , is the behavior of material objects . to describe it",
    ", we use both a metric and a set of dynamical laws , neither of which is separately observable .",
    "hence , in principle , the same behavior is describable in relation to different metrization schemes , by alternative sets of physical laws .",
    "this means that the metric properties of the world are partly based on a conventional choice between alternative sets of laws , as was stressed by poincar  @xcite .",
    "if we embrace relationism , we can not attribute continuity to physical space as if this were a separate constituent of the world  a three - dimensional expanse existing independently of its material `` content '' . if there is anything in the physical world to which we can attribute the continuity that we find in phenomenal space ,",
    "it is the spatial relations that exist between material objects .",
    "( as the following section will show , it is not necessary to attribute continuity separately to the forms of spatially extended objects , for such forms are simply sets of spatial relations . ) moreover , since the synchronic multiplicity of the world is limited to the multiplicity of material objects existing at any one time and the multiplicity of their relations , each relation possesses not only this continuity but also the unity of an undifferentiated line segment .",
    "let me amplify .",
    "given cartesian coordinates , the spatial relation between two material objects @xmath6 and @xmath7 is essentially the distance @xmath8 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is _ quantitatively _ determined by the algebraic differences between the coordinates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "but the distances between material objects also have a _ qualitative _ character .",
    "they are not just numbers ; they are _",
    "spatial_. we tend to think of @xmath8 as a quantity , and we tend to attribute to this `` quantity '' the multiplicity of some interval of the so - called `` real line '' .",
    "that is , we tend to take it for granted that there are as many places between the two objects as there are real numbers between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the value of @xmath8 .",
    "in reality there are as many places in the material world as there are material objects . the places at",
    "which objects may be located do not actually exist unless objects are actually located there .",
    "thus if we consider the distance @xmath8 , we are looking at something that possesses the quality of spatial extension as well as a value @xmath10 , but that is destitute of multiplicity . unless there are other , appropriately situated objects , there are no places between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it thus is a mistake to think of @xmath8 as intrinsically multiple .",
    "there is no multiplicity that would qualify as inherent in a single spatial relation .",
    "there are no points or places between @xmath6 and @xmath7 unless other material objects are situated between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it takes a third object @xmath11 to introduce another two distances @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "the same equation does not hold among the three distances @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "none of these distances is the sum of anything .",
    "@xmath8 is not a quantity that is `` made up '' of quantities ; it is a relation that possesses ( i )  the qualitative property of undifferentiated continuous extension and ( ii )  the value @xmath10 .",
    "it interposes no places between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if anything interposes a location between the location of @xmath6 and the location of @xmath7 , it is another material object @xmath11 .    to thinkers from aristotle to kant and gauss it appeared self - evident that points on a line are extrinsic to the line , in the sense that they are additional features not contained in its image .",
    "they considered the line itself and , by implication , space itself is an inherently undivided `` whole '' existing in an anterior relationship to limits and divisions .",
    "`` space is essentially one '' , kant wrote  @xcite , `` the manifold in it",
    "  arises entirely from the introduction of limits . ''",
    "kant was right in saying that what is continuous is intrinsically one .",
    "but he was wrong in attributing the world s synchronic multiplicity to the introduction of limits .",
    "synchronic multiplicity owes its reality to the spatial relations that exist between objects .",
    "therefore there exists no such tension of contrast as that between the unity of a three - dimensional continuous expanse and a multiplicity of divisions that somehow appear in it .",
    "continuity and unity are not properties of `` space itself '' but pertain to ( are instantiated with ) each spatial relation between a pair of material objects .",
    "the continuous unity of @xmath8 thus in no way conflicts with the spatial multiplicity of the world , for the former belongs to _ each _ spatial relation while the latter belongs to the totality of spatial relations that exist in the world .",
    "we have assumed the existence of cartesian coordinates .",
    "since the central purpose of this article is to find a way of thinking about the world s actual multiplicity that is consistent with quantum mechanics ( or a way of thinking about quantum mechanics that is consistent with the world s actual multiplicity ) , this assumption is justified by the fact that quantum mechanics _",
    "presupposes _ the use of cartesian coordinates .",
    "specifically , every quantization scheme that leads to hilbert space vectors and weyl operators presupposes the `` flat '' metric that goes with cartesian coordinates  @xcite .",
    "is found in practice to be successful only when applied to the dynamical coordinates and momenta referring to a cartesian system of axes and not to more general curvilinear coordinates ''  dirac  @xcite . ] to see why this should be so , we must bear in mind that in quantum mechanics coordinates do not represent positions but _ values _ that are available for attribution to the positions of material objects . since these positions are relative positions , a useful coordinate system has to be riveted to some material object ( e.g. , the nucleus of an atom , the center of mass of a composite object , a macroscopic part of a macroscopic apparatus ) .",
    "a coordinate system @xmath15 riveted to a given object @xmath6 represents the `` space '' of values that are potentially attributable to the positions of objects @xmath16 relative to @xmath6 , but it does _ not _ represent the `` space '' of values that are potentially attributable to the positions of the objects @xmath16 relative to each other .",
    "the appropriate value `` space '' for the positions of the objects @xmath16 , @xmath17 , relative to @xmath18 is not @xmath15 but @xmath19 .",
    "this would be of no consequence if the relative positions of material objects had definite values , for then @xmath19 could be obtained by simply translating ( and maybe rotating ) @xmath15 .",
    "but since the relative position of each pair of material objects is to some extent `` fuzzy ''  a notion that will be substantiated and made precise in what follows ,   there is nt any point transformation that takes us from @xmath15 to @xmath19 .",
    "it follows that the coordinate `` space '' presupposed by quantum mechanics can have nothing to do with curvature .",
    "this `` space '' of attributable values is always riveted to a _ single _",
    "material object @xmath6 , whereas a test for curvature involves at least two different , not determinately related , value `` spaces '' .",
    "( to detect curvature near @xmath6 , one needs to know not only the positions of nearby objects @xmath16 relative to @xmath6 but also the positions of the objects @xmath16 relative to each other . )",
    "each individual value `` space '' is therefore necessarily and trivially flat .    in this section arguments supporting the following notions",
    "have been presented :    * physical space is not a set of point individuals but a system of spatial relations that hold among material objects . * like the sensation of turquoise ,",
    "continuous extension is a qualitative feature of our visual percepts . unlike that sensation",
    ", it is an objective feature of the physical world ( that is , it is an objective feature of every spatial relation ) . * the relative position of any pair of material objects ( or the distance between the two objects ) lacks multiplicity ; it possesses the quality of continuous spatial extension ( in one dimension ) and the undifferentiated unity of an unsegmented line in phenomenal space . *",
    "the spatial multiplicity of the world is the multiplicity of spatial relations that hold among material objects .",
    "it is not due to the introduction of boundaries . *",
    "a clear distinction has to be made between physical space and the set @xmath0  of values that are potentially attributable to the relative positions of material objects .",
    "the quality of continuous spatial extension is not attributable to this set , nor is the concept of curvature applicable to it .",
    "as will become clear in what follows , the conceptual framework staked out so far is eminently suited to the task at hand  making sense of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us now take account of the relevant empirical findings .",
    "we begin with the existence of simple or noncomposite entities , which we will refer to as `` fundamental particles '' . according to the current standard model of elementary particle physics ,",
    "the particles that are fundamental are the quarks and the leptons , but all we need to know or assume at this point is that noncomposite objects exist . combined with the conclusions reached in the previous section , this warrants the following claims :    * any composite material object ( with the possible exception of the universe as a whole ) is made up of a finite number of fundamental particles _ and _ the spatial relations that hold among them . to the particles it owes its finite multiplicity ; to the spatial relations it owes its spatial extension .",
    "* there are not two kinds of spatially extended things , such as regions of space and a material stuff that occupies or fills them .",
    "the only kind of spatial extension in existence is the spatial extension that is attributable to possessed spatial relations .",
    "there is no material stuff that occupies or fills space .",
    "what is spatially extended either is a spatial relation or has spatial relations among its constituents .",
    "a composite object `` occupies '' space only in the sense that it is partly constituted by the spatial relations between its material constituents .",
    "* there are not two kinds of synchronic multiplicity , such as a multiplicity of material things and a multiplicity of self - existing locations .",
    "there is only the multiplicity of fundamental particles and the multiplicity of their spatial relations .",
    "the actually existing locations are the ( relatively defined ) positions that are attributable to fundamental particles and composites thereof .    in respect of any given object @xmath20 , one may distinguish two kinds of spatial relations : those _ internal _ to @xmath20 , which hold between its material constituents , and those _ external _ to @xmath20 , which hold between @xmath20 or its material constituents and objects having no constituents in common with @xmath20 . by definition ,",
    "a fundamental particle lacks internal spatial relations . in the minds of most physicists",
    "an object lacking internal spatial relations is pointlike , but such an object may just as well be formless . it must be emphasized that there can be no direct evidence of either the formlessness or the pointlike form of a fundamental particle . what can be experimentally ascertained about a specific type of particle",
    "is the absence of evidence of internal structure . if absence of evidence is interpreted as evidence of absence ",
    "the standard model does this in respect of the quarks and the leptons ,   this may be construed either as the possession of a pointlike form or as the nonexistence of any form . on the latter view , the forms of all the beasts and baubles in this world resolve themselves into the spatial relations that obtain among their constituent parts .",
    "ultimate parts have no parts , so they also have no form . on the former view there exists , in addition to the forms that resolve themselves into spatial relations , another type of spatial form , namely the pointlike form of a fundamental particle .",
    "it is obvious which is the more parsimonious view .",

    "and so there is no pointlike form either , as this implies the existence of such an expanse .",

    "so which is it ",
    "`` existence itself '' or an instance of it ?",
    "the answer is an unequivocal `` both '' .",
    "to arrive at this conclusion , we will have to take account of another empirical finding .",
    "let us consider a scattering experiment with particles of the same type ",
    "say , two protons .",
    "let us assume that there are two incoming particles , one ( @xmath22 ) moving northwards and one ( @xmath4 ) moving southwards , and two outgoing particles , one ( @xmath23 ) moving eastwards and one ( @xmath24 ) moving westwards .",
    "anyone unfamiliar with quantum mechanics will expect the following to be the case : either @xmath22 is the same particle as @xmath24 and @xmath4 is the same particle as @xmath23 , or @xmath22 is the same particle as @xmath23 and @xmath4 is the same particle as @xmath24 . yet",
    "nothing could be further from the truth .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us in no uncertain terms that neither of the incoming particles is identical with either of the outgoing particles .",
    "one arrives at this conclusion by considering the probability @xmath25 of the assumed final state ( one eastbound particle and one westbound particle ) , given the assumed initial state . if the particles are of different types  say , a proton and a neutron in , a proton and a neutron out ",
    "@xmath25 is the sum of two probabilities , the probability that @xmath22 is the same particle as @xmath23 and @xmath4 is the same particle as @xmath24 , and the probability that @xmath22 is the same particle as @xmath24 and @xmath4 is the same particle as @xmath23 , in agreement with the dictates of common sense : @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the respective probability amplitudes associated with the alternatives ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , in obvious notation .",
    "the two possibilities that contribute to @xmath25 are illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "if the particles are of the same type , the probability for scattering at right angles is given by @xmath33 for bosons @xmath34 , and @xmath25 is twice as large as @xmath35 : @xmath36 for fermions @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "both results are inconsistent with the notion that the two particles possess permanent identities . _",
    "a fortiori _ they are inconsistent with the idea that a particle possesses the property of `` being this very particle '' , known to philosophers as `` thisness '' or `` haecceity '' .    before and after the scattering , the two particles possess distinguishing characteristics : they travel in opposite directions , and they are in different places ( relative to the laboratory frame ) . but at the time of scattering no such distinguishing characteristics exist , nor is it possible to causally link a particular incoming particle to a particular outgoing particle , nor can there be anything ( such as thisness ) that makes up for the missing causal identifiers .",
    "all of this follows from the experimentally confirmed scattering probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "how many things , then , exist at the time of scattering ?",
    "two absolutely indistinguishable things ? or a single thing with the capacity for twofold instantiation ?",
    "according to the identity of indiscernibles , there can not be two absolutely indistinguishable things .",
    "seen from the laboratory frame , the two particles are absolutely indistinguishable at the time of scattering . in particular , their positions relative to the laboratory frame are identical . in spite of this , however , the two particles remain in possession of a nontrivial relative position , and this is sufficient for them to be two things even at the time of scattering . by a `` nontrivial relative position '' i mean a relative position that is not equivalent to an exactly vanishing distance .",
    "( owing to the fuzziness of all possessed relative positions , no relative position is trivial in this sense . ) the existence of a relation implies the existence of _ two _ relata .",
    "the spatial relation that exists between the two particles thus warrants their twoness without making them discernible in the laboratory frame .",
    "this permits either of two conclusions .",
    "if we consider the possession of distinguishing properties relative to the laboratory frame necessary for the discernibility of the two particles , then at the time of scattering there exist two indiscernible particles , and the identity of indiscernibles fails .",
    "if on the other hand we consider the existence of a not exactly vanishing distance between the two particles sufficient for their being discernible , then all particles are discernible , and the principle holds .    in either case , the reason why the two particles at the time of scattering are two things is their nontrivial spatial relation .",
    "hence intrinsically ( that is , considered _ out of relation _ to each other ) the two particles are not two things .",
    "they are identical , and this not in the weak sense of exact similarity but in the strong sense of _ numerical identity_. hence the unequivocal `` both '' : intrinsically ( out of relation to each other ) either particle is `` existence itself '' , and extrinsically ( that is , by virtue of the spatial relation between them ) , they are two instances of `` existence itself '' .",
    "what has been established so far is that particles of the same type , considered out of relation to each other , are numerically identical .",
    "if type conversions are possible , this conclusion can be extended to particles of different types .",
    "suppose that the two particles in our scattering experiment are of different types ( e.g. , a proton and a neutron in , a proton and a neutron out ) but that particles of the first type can be converted into particles of the second type ( a proton into a neutron and vice versa ) .",
    "further suppose that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are of type  1 , and that @xmath4 and @xmath24 are of type  2 .",
    "then the probability of this scattering event is given by @xmath39 where the indices specify the types to which the incoming and outgoing particles belong .",
    "once again it is impossible to say whether a particular incoming particle is the same as or different from a particular outgoing particle . and",
    "the reason this is so is not that we have no means of knowing which of the alternatives depicted in fig .",
    "2 represents what actually happens .",
    "the reason this is so is that the distinction we make between the alternatives is a distinction that nature does not make .",
    "nothing in the physical world corresponds to the conceptual difference between these alternatives .",
    "it would therefore be incorrect to interpret the specified scattering event by affirming that the particles scatter _ both _ with and without type swapping , and it would be equally incorrect to interpret it by affirming that the particles scatter _ neither _ with _ nor _ without type swapping . both interpretations involve a conceptual distinction that nature does not make .",
    "that distinction exists solely in our minds .",
    "the same argument that took us from @xmath25 to the numerical identity of particles of the same type ( considered out of relation to each other ) , now takes us from @xmath40 to the numerical identity of all particles of the same _ basic _ type ( considered out of relation to each other ) .",
    "what is characteristic of a basic particle species is that its members can not be converted into members of a different basic species .",
    "how many basic types of particle exist depends on the theory .",
    "according to the standard model , a member of one of the two species of particles known respectively as hadrons and leptons can not be converted into a member of the other species ( the same applies to bosons and fermions ) , while in the so - called grand unified theories hadrons and leptons are mutually convertible , and in supersymmetric theories `` once a fermion , always a fermion '' is no longer true either . in these theories , being a hadron , lepton , boson , or fermion is an accidental property of something that by itself is neither hadron nor lepton nor boson nor fermion ; there exists just one basic type of particle .",
    "but whether or not the final theory ( assuming that there will be one ) permits conversions between all particle types , the property of belonging to a particular type of particle can be thought of as accidental or contingent , and all existing fundamental particles can be thought of as being intrinsically one and the same entity ",
    "`` existence itself '' .",
    "moreover , as was pointed out in note 8 , particle species are distinguished by what is essentially a set of dynamical parameters governing the evolution of spatial relations . as attributes of an individual particle , considered out of relation to other particles , these parameters are meaningless .",
    "hence if we consider a fundamental particle as it is in itself , we must mentally strip it not only of its spatial relations but also of the type to which it belongs .",
    "this too entails that intrinsically all fundamental particles are identical in the strongest possible sense : but for their spatial relations , they are one and the same entity .",
    "the basic reality of matter , accordingly , is not a multitude of fundamental particles but a _ single entity _ , and this entity can not be qualified as anything more particular or determinate than `` existence itself '' .",
    "henceforth i shall omit the coy quotation marks and represent this entity by the symbol @xmath41 .",
    "a fundamental particle is not just _ like _ @xmath42 ; each fundamental particle _ is _ @xmath42 . at bottom",
    "the world has exactly one fundamental material constituent , namely @xmath42 .",
    "the individuation or multiple instantiation of @xmath41 is a consequence of the realization , or the coming into existence , of spatial relations .",
    "@xmath42 has the capacity to enter into spatial relations with itself , and this is what gives it the aspect of a multitude of relata .",
    "but what exists at either end of each spatial relation , considered in itself , is identically the same entity @xmath42 . at bottom",
    "all there is is @xmath42 and spatial relations between @xmath41 and itself .",
    "the spatial relations owe their existence to @xmath42  they exist because they are relational determinations of @xmath42 ,   and @xmath42 owes its individuation or multiple instantiation to the existence of spatial relations : a multiplicity of relations implies a multiplicity of relata , even if intrinsically each relatum  each fundamental particle of matter  is @xmath42 .",
    "instantiation is traditionally conceived as running parallel to predication : what gets instantiated is a predicable universal ; the resulting instance is an impredicable individual .",
    "this way of thinking suggests that what is responsible for the instantiation is something that is present in the individual but absent from the universal , and this idea is at the root of the platonic - aristotelian dualism of matter and form and its subsequent transformations , including the idea that physical qualities are instantiated by the `` points of space '' .",
    "the individuation that takes us from @xmath42 to the fundamental particles of matter is something else altogether .",
    "a fundamental particle is not two things  ( i )",
    "instantiated existence and ( ii )  something ( such as a `` point of space '' or a part of plato s matter - space ) that does the instantiating . in a fundamental particle there is nt anything that is distinct from @xmath42 and of which existence is predicable .",
    "there is nothing that acquires `` @xmath42-ness '' the way a bounded portion of platonic - aristotelian matter acquires being or actuality .",
    "there is nothing present in a fundamental particle that is absent from @xmath42 .",
    "only existence can instantiate existence , for an effective instantiator must exist in advance of the instantiation , and the only `` thing '' that exists in advance of the instantiation of @xmath42 is @xmath42 .",
    "but this is the same as saying that the only way to instantiate existence is to relate it to itself . only in this way",
    "can the proper logical dependences be implemented : the instances of existence exist because the instantiating spatial relations exist ; the instantiating relations exist because they are properties of @xmath42 ( or because @xmath42 has assumed them , or because @xmath42 has entered into spatial relations with itself ) ; and @xmath42 exists because it is `` the one independent reality of which all things are an expression '' ( a dictionary definition of `` the absolute ''  @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath42 and its instances thus is as close and as intelligible as can be .",
    "it is not some mystical relation between formless matter and immaterial form .",
    "it is identity plain and simple .",
    "the spatial multiplicity of the world is not based on something that is intrinsically multiple like plato s matter or a set of point - individuals with the cardinality of the reals .",
    "it is a multiplicity of relations that entails a multiplicity of relata .",
    "but only the relata _ qua _ relata are many .",
    "intrinsically ( out of relation to other particles ) each relatum is @xmath41 .",
    "the `` expression '' of the one independent reality @xmath42 is effected by means of relations between @xmath42 and itself .",
    "physical properties are relational  they are either spatial relations or dynamical parameters governing the evolution of spatial relations ,   and since existence is contingently attributable to them , they may be thought of as universals .",
    "but @xmath42 can not be thought of as another universal .",
    "material things are made of relations , and these owe their existence not to a predicable universal but to the existence that they relate .",

    "the three propositions just considered are based on the assumption that the two slits are distinct _ per",

    "but if a distinction exists solely in our minds , the same is true of any notion that implies the distinction .",
    "the notion which makes the two alternatives in a two - slit experiment distinct for us , and the behavior of electrons incomprehensible , is the notion that physical space is intrinsically and infinitely differentiated .",
    "the notion that the multiplicity of @xmath0  is inherent in physical space ( and that , consequently , the individual points of space or space - time can be regarded as carriers of physical properties ) is as inconsistent with quantum mechanics as the notion of absolute simultaneity is with special relativity .",
    "this notion perhaps more than any other is what prevents us from making sense of quantum mechanics .",
    "if space were an intrinsically and infinitely differentiated constituent of the physical world , then any spatial region , however small , would _ per se _ be distinct from any other ( disjoint ) spatial region , and every material object @xmath20 would consist of as many spatial parts as the space it occupies .",

    "in reality  so the behavior of the electrons tells us ",
    "space is a system of spatial relations between material objects , and these spatial relations are ( more or less ) indefinite .",
    "the behavior of electrons in two - slit interference experiments is nature s corroboration of the relationist conception of physical space developed in secs .  2 and 3 .",
    "such an experiment typically features several macroscopic objects like an electron gun ( a heated tungsten wire in a metal box with a hole , the wire being at a negative voltage with respect to the box ) , a thin metal plate with two slits in it , and an array of detectors ( geiger counters or electron multipliers connected to loudspeakers ) .",
    "what these objects have in common is that their relative positions can be treated as definite .",
    "the only objects with pertinently indefinite positions ( relative to any macroscopic part of the apparatus ) are the electrons coming from the electron gun .",
    "we tend to visualize the position @xmath48 of such an electron ( relative to the apparatus ) as a cloud or a smudge ( a `` wave packet '' or , worse , two `` wave packets '' ) .",

    "only if a detector clicks ( that is , only if there is a matter of fact about the particular region containing the electron or the particular section crossed by the electron ) is the corresponding value actually attributable to @xmath48 , as will become clear in what follows .    if the substantival , set - theoretic conception of physical space is inconsistent with quantum mechanics , so is the doctrine called local realism , according to which , `` ",

    "if the doctrine of local realism is an exploded myth , so is the principle of local action ( a.k.a . local causality ) , according to which the `` local matters of particular fact '' at a point @xmath51 are influenced only by the `` local matters of particular fact '' in the infinitesimal neighborhood of  @xmath51 .",
    "local action therefore can not be the solution to the perceived problem of action at a distance . nor does this require a solution , since it is a pseudo - problem arising from erroneous assumptions .",
    "for one thing , it presupposes the existence of separate interacting entities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as the existence of separate regions of space containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 . but @xmath6 and @xmath7 are nt separate entities , nor are there separate regions of space . if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fundamental particles , they both are @xmath42 , and if they are composite objects , the ultimate material constituents of @xmath6 are numerically identical with the ultimate material constituents of @xmath7 . physical space , on the other hand , is nt something that by itself has parts ; it is a system of spatial relations between material objects . the spatial differentiation of the physical world is a property of its material content , not of a substantivally conceived space .",

    "the case for instrumentalism is that the position - indicating clicks are not only sufficient but also necessary for the existence of the positions indicated by the clicks .",
    "that is why bohr  @xcite insisted on the necessity of describing quantum phenomena in terms of the experimental arrangements in which they are displayed .",
    "but this does not mean that there is no object to which the indicated positions can be attributed .",

    "but if the theoretical structure is anchored neither in microscopic space - time realities nor in concrete sense realities , then what supports it ?",

    "the parameter @xmath76 in the ( born ) probability distribution @xmath89 is not the time at which the probability of finding @xmath20 in @xmath49 has the value @xmath90 .",

    "this applies not only to born probabilities , which take account of the system s `` preparation '' only , but also to abl probabilities , which also take account of the system s `` retroparation '' . on the other hand , if no measurement is made at the time @xmath76 , the abl probabilities associated with @xmath84 s range of possible values and the specified time @xmath76 are objective , in the sense that they have nothing to do with ignorance .",

    "( @xmath114 could also be macroscopic for the unlikely reason that such detectors , though they exist , never indicate a departure from @xmath114 s classically predicted position . ) ]    while the positions of things dangle from ( are supervenient on ) position - indicating facts , the positions of macroscopic objects do so in a way that evinces no indefiniteness .",
    "although no object ever follows a definite trajectory , the positions of macroscopic objects ",
    "`` macroscopic positions '' , for short  evolve in a completely predictable fashion . applying to macroscopic positions the formalism of quantum mechanics is therefore completely uncalled - for .",
    "it is perfectly legitimate to treat these positions as forming a self - contained system of _ intrinsic _ positions that dangle causally from each other , rather than a system of _ extrinsic _ positions that dangle ontologically from position - indicating facts .",
    "while even a macroscopic object has a position only because of the facts from which this can be inferred , the dependence of this position on position - indicating facts is a _ qualitative _ ( ontological or existential ) dependence , not a _ quantitative _ one . for the quantitative purposes of physics , it is legitimate to ignore this dependence , to consider macroscopic positions `` in themselves '' ( out of relation to position - indicating facts ) , to treat them as facts ( rather than as inferences from facts ) , and to apply to them classical causal concepts .",
    "it ought to be borne in mind , however , that causal concepts are emergent : causality is nt part of the ontological foundation . as we saw earlier in this section , all the determining that goes on in the physical world is the determining _ of probabilities _ associated with possibilities .",
    "there are nt any causally determined _ facts_. causality , like color , lies in the mind of the beholder  @xcite .",
    "much of what has been said in the last two sections hinges on the following questions : what constitutes a ( matter of ) fact ? what is an actual event or state of affairs ?",
    "we are now in a position to answer these questions .",
    "as we have just seen , it is legitimate to ignore the extrinsic nature of macroscopic positions , to treat them as facts .",
    "the relevant facts , actual events , or actual states of affairs either are macroscopic positions or are definable in terms of such positions .",
    "it is irrelevant that the property - indicating position of a macroscopic pointer needle dangles ontologically from facts that involve other macroscopic positions . where the indicated property is concerned , the indicating position can be thought of as intrinsic , and hence as a position - indicating fact .",
    "thus there exists a `` classical domain '' of ( macroscopic ) positions that are not manifestly indefinite , and that can be thought of as intrinsic or as being factual _ per se_. this is fortunate , for otherwise quantum mechanics would be inconsistent , as its very formulation presupposes property- and time - indicating facts . until recently the ciqm has been the only interpretation of quantum mechanics that acknowledges the logical dependence of quantum mechanics on a classical domain , and therefore , in my opinion , it has been the only interpretation worth considering .",
    "the ciqm has been censured for being `` vague , obscure , and maybe even inconsistent '' by loewer  @xcite , but these strictures do not touch the core of the ciqm , which consists in the rejection of fundamental microscopic space - time realities and the substitution for them of property - indicating facts amenable to classical description .",
    "they address extraneous attempts to reintroduce unwarranted classical ideas , such as the notion of a quantum state that evolves in an intrinsically differentiated time .    according to loewer , the vagueness of the conceptual muddle he passes off as the `` copenhagen interpretation '' lies in the absence of ( i )  a clear distinction between classical and quantum systems and ( ii )  a clear definition of `` measurement '' .",
    "its obscurity consists in its `` spooky '' nonlocality , in the `` relationship between measurement and determinate reality '' , and in our ( or at least , loewer s ) inability to understand how the position of a particle can lack a determinate value .",
    "its possible inconsistency is that ( according to loewer ) `` it makes assertions about the nature of quantum - mechanical reality '' and at the same time `` denies that anything can be known about that reality '' .",
    "as i said , none of these strictures touch the core of the ciqm . in my forthcoming  @xcite",
    "i have expanded this core into a complete ontological interpretation , dubbed the `` pondicherry interpretation of quantum mechanics '' ( piqm ) .",
    "the piqm makes a clear distinction between the classical and quantum domains .",
    "the classical domain contains all those possessed properties that are not manifestly indefinite ( including those that warrant inferences to possessed properties in the quantum domain ) .",
    "the quantum domain contains all other factually warranted properties .",

    "a measurement is not something that causes the `` collapse '' of an evolving quantum state .",
    "every property - indicating fact ( that is , every event or state of affairs in the classical domain warranting an inference to some possessed property ) qualifies as a `` measurement result '' .",
    "the relationship between measurement and determinate reality is equally clear .",
    "determinate reality is the totality of factually warranted properties , while measurements provide the property - indicating facts .    as to the alleged nonlocality of the ciqm",
    ", it depends .",
    "if this is supposed to mean that `` a measurement of a part of a system at one location can instantaneously change the physical situation of far distant parts of that system ''  @xcite , then it does not exist .",
    "this kind of action at a distance is one of the absurdities that follow from the spurious notion of an evolving quantum state . according to both the piqm and the solid core of the ciqm ,",
    "all that the quantum formalism tells us about is objective correlations between possibilities and statistical correlations between factually warranted properties or property - indicating facts  diachronic correlations between the factually warranted properties of the same system at different times and synchronic correlations between the factually warranted properties of different systems in spacelike separation .",
    "it says nothing whatsoever about causal connections between the correlated properties or facts .",
    "in particular , it says nothing about changes in physical situations that are caused by measurements  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the very fact that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with local action , as was shown in sec .",
    "5 , implies its nonlocality .",
    "nonlocality is a characteristic of the observed correlations ( the diachronic as well as the synchronic ones ) and thus independent of any particular explanation of the correlations ( such as an instantaneous action at a distance ) .    as to the `` spookiness '' of the nonlocality evinced by the correlations , it is a subject for psychology or neurophysiology rather than physics , and so is loewer s inability to understand how the position of a particle can lack a determinate value .",
    "these nonphysical issues deserve a separate section ( sec .",
    "10 ) . that a sense of the miraculous accompanies all fundamental explanations is to be expected , however .",
    "explanations begin with the fundamental behavior of matter , which can be described , but which can not itself be explained .",
    "( if it could , it would nt be fundamental . )",
    "diachronic correlations that are not manifestly indeterministic can be passed off as causal explanations .",
    "but when we deal with synchronic correlations or diachronic correlations that are manifestly indeterministic , causal concepts are out of place . trying to causally",
    "explain these correlations is putting the cart in front of the horse .",
    "it is the correlations that explain why causal explanations work to the extent they do .",
    "they work in the classical domain where we are dealing with macroscopic objects , and where the correlations between property - indicating facts evince no statistical variations ( dispersion ) .",
    "if we go beyond this domain , it becomes clear that even where no statistical variations are in evidence , the correlations between facts are statistical rather than causal .",
    "loewer s claim that the ciqm both `` makes assertions about the nature of quantum - mechanical reality '' and `` denies that anything can be known about that reality '' is based on the following claims , which he attributes to the ciqm : `` the right way to understand quantum mechanics is not as a true description of physical reality but rather as an _ instrument _ for predicting the outcomes of laboratory experiments .",
    "there is no coherent interpretation of the quantum - mechanical formalism as describing an unobservable reality that is responsible for those experimental results . that reality is forever beyond our ken . ''",
    "the piqm denies not merely the possibility of such an interpretation but the very existence of an unobservable reality that is responsible for the experimental results .",
    "there is no reality beyond our ken .",
    "quantum mechanics is an instrument for assigning conditional probabilities to possible property - indicating facts on the basis of actual property - indicating facts . under certain conditions , specified above ,",
    "these conditional probabilities are objective and indicative of an objective indefiniteness .",
    "this has implications concerning the actual spatiotemporal differentiation of the physical world . and",
    "all this is part of the true and complete description of physical reality that quantum mechanics affords .",
    "if there is anything that is incomplete , it is the physical world , but its incompleteness exists only in relation to a conceptual framework that is more detailed than the physical world , as i proceed to show .",
    "because there exists a finite limit to the spatial resolution of actually existing detectors , any finite region @xmath43 contains at most a finite number of regions @xmath100 the distinctness of which is physically realized .",
    "accordingly , for any material object @xmath20 located within @xmath43 at most a finite number of alternative positions ( `` inside @xmath100 '' ) are available as possible attributes . hence there exists in our minds ( that is , we can conceive of ) a finite partition @xmath110 of the macroscopic frame that exists _ only _ in our minds .",
    "the elements of @xmath110 are so small that there are nt any detectors capable of realizing their conceptual distinctness .",

    "thus not only the mental picture of sharply bounded regions @xmath49 but also the mental picture of fuzzily bounded regions @xmath49 is more detailed than the finitely differentiated reality it is supposed to represent .",
    "the boundaries of these regions are neither sharp nor fuzzy ! the notion that `` sharp '' and `` fuzzy '' are jointly exhaustive terms originates in an inadequate theoretical representation of the world s actual spatial differentiation .",
    "it involves a conception that is inconsistent with quantum mechanics  the conception of an intrinsically and infinitely differentiated space .",
    "while no object ever has a definite position , the positions of macroscopic objects are not manifestly indefinite .",
    "how real is the indefiniteness of a position that is not manifestly indefinite ?",
    "the answer is , _ not real at all_. in a world that is spatially differentiated only to the extent that spatial relations and distinctions can be inferred from facts , no object has a sharp position .",
    "but there are objects that have the sharpest positions in existence , and the position of such an object is not fuzzy in any actual sense . for its fuzziness to be actual in some sense",
    ", the position has to be distributed , either statistically or counterfactually , over the sensitive regions of actually existing detectors .",
    "but if it were distributed over such regions , it would not be among the sharpest positions in existence  the positions of the detectors would be sharper .",
    "thus the positions of macroscopic objects are fuzzy only in relation to an unrealized degree of spatial differentiation .",
    "the indefiniteness of a macroscopic position exists only in relation to a theoretical framework that is more detailed than the physical world .    as positions have no physical reality unless they are attributable to material objects , so times have no physical reality unless they are attributable to possessed properties , as the times at which these are possessed .",
    "the reason this is so is that time , like space , is nt something that is intrinsically differentiated .",
    "it takes time - indicating facts to differentiate the world timewise .",
    "but times are indicated by factually warranted relative positions . since these are more or less indefinite , the indicated times , too , are more or less indefinite . for instance",
    ", if there is nt any matter of fact about the time @xmath123 at which an electron passes through the slit plate , @xmath123 lacks a definite value with respect to any partition of the interval between the time of emission by the electron gun and the time of detection behind the slit plate . instead of",
    "either a lower - case @xmath76 or the operator symbol @xmath124 is intended as a reminder that time is not a proper quantum - mechanical observable ( a hermitian operator on a hilbert space ) , and that @xmath123 , consequently , is not one of the possible values of such an observable . in general , neither a self - adjoint time operator conjugate to the hamiltonian  @xcite nor a time - of - arrival operator  @xcite exists .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that quantum - mechanical probability distributions are distributions over the possible results of possible measurements that are actually or counterfactually performed at _ specified _ times .",
    "there are no quantum - mechanical probability distributions over time intervals .",
    "] however , there are _ macroscopic times _ that are not manifestly indefinite , just as there are macroscopic positions the indefiniteness of which is never evidenced by departures from what is predictable on the basis of classical laws and earlier property - indicating facts .",
    "let us extend our definition of the `` macroscopic frame '' to include the not manifestly indefinite times indicated by macroscopic positions .",
    "it follows from what has just been said that there exists in our minds ( that is , we can conceive of ) a partition of the macroscopic frame into finite intervals of time that are so small that nothing in the physical world corresponds to the distinctions we make between these intervals .",
    "once again the distinctions exist solely in our minds .",
    "the physical world is temporally differentiated only to the extent that temporal relations and distinctions can be inferred from facts , and the facts warrant neither the inference of a definite temporal relation nor the partition of any finite interval of physical time into infinitely many time spans . as there is a finite limit to the spatial resolution of actually existing detectors , so there is a finite limit to the temporal resolution of actually existing clocks a material object can possess at most a finite number of distinct time - indicating properties .",
    "let @xmath125 be an observable whose eigenkets represent the distinct time - indicating properties of a clock @xmath11 .",

    "no property is ever possessed at a definite time .",
    "but there are clocks , which we may call `` macroscopic clocks '' , that indicate the sharpest times in existence , which we may call `` macroscopic times '' .",
    "macroscopic times are not fuzzy in any actual sense ; they are fuzzy only in relation to an unrealized degree of temporal differentiation . like the indefiniteness of a macroscopic position , the indefiniteness of a macroscopic time exists only in relation to a theoretical framework that is more detailed than the physical world .",
    "the seemingly intractable problem of understanding quantum mechanics is a consequence of our dogged insistence on obtruding onto the physical world a theoretical framework that is more detailed than the physical world .",

    "it is a kind of instinct . ''",
    "not only do we atomize matter ( which has its physical legitimacy ) but we also atomize space and time ( which is a mistake ) , and we tend to model the atomization of matter after the atomization of space ( which is another mistake ) .",
    "that is , we tend to think of the parts of matter as being defined by the parts of space .",
    "in actual fact , the ultimate `` parts '' of matter are the fundamental particles , and these are not defined by the `` parts '' of space .",
    "space is nt something that has parts , so it can not serve to define parts .",
    "the `` parts '' of matter are defined by the spatial relations that exist between them .",
    "this view , and only this , allows the spatial relations to possess indefinite values .",
    "the fundamental particles exist in space only in the sense that ( more or less indefinite ) relative positions can be attributed to them . considered in itself , out of relation to other material objects ,",
    "a fundamental particle does not exist in space , for in itself it has neither a position nor a form .",
    "physical space exists _ between _ the fundamental particles ; they _ unfold _ it by means of their relative positions ; it is _ spanned _ by them .",
    "moreover , while multiplicity is attributable to the fundamental particles _ qua _ spatial relata , it is not attributable to the fundamental particles considered out of relation to each other .",
    "reality , therefore , is built `` top - down '' : by entering into a multitude of spatial relations with itself , @xmath42 takes on not only the aspect of a spatially differentiated world but also the aspect of a multiplicity of fundamental particles . and",
    "by allowing the relations to _ change _ , to possess different values _ in succession _ , it takes on the further aspect of a temporally differentiated world .",
    "there are limits to the resulting differentiations . while the sharpest relative positions and times are indefinite only relative to an unrealized degree of differentiation , the more fuzzy ones are indefinite relative to the realized degree of differentiation ( that is , they are manifestly indefinite ) . but manifestly indefinite positions and times can not be thought of as intrinsic .",
    "there is therefore another sense in which reality is built `` from the top down '' .",

    "it is the _",
    "ide fixe _ that the world s synchronic multiplicity is founded on the introduction of surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three - dimensional cookie cutters .",
    "i call it the `` cookie cutter paradigm '' ( ccp ) .",
    "if the physical reality of space - dividing surfaces is accepted , it needs to be accounted for , and there are at least three ways of doing so .",
    "the first is to understand those surfaces as boundaries between `` full '' and `` empty '' space ( that is , as closed surfaces encompassing some kind of stuff ) .",
    "this is the way of the greek atomists , who taught that atoms are filled with being while the empty space around them lacks being .",
    "the second ",
    "the most literal version of the ccp  is due to plato .",
    "plato s forms have an immaterial existence of their own , independently of their instantiation in the physical world .",
    "insofar as they bear spatial connotations , they connote closed surfaces .",
    "divisions in material space exist to the extent that forms with spatial connotations are present ( instantiated ) in the physical world .",
    "the third way of accounting for the existence of spatial divisions is to attribute them to space itself . on this account ,",
    "all conceivable divisions of space are physically real and intrinsic to space . reduced to one dimension this leads to the view that a set of points in one - to - one correspondence with the real numbers is intrinsic to a continuous line .",
    "this raises the issue of whether these points `` make up '' or `` fill '' the line or are separated by infinitesimal intervals .",
    "it is customary to equate real numbers whose decimal expansions converge , e.g. , @xmath127 .",
    "if we follow this practice  not everyone does  @xcite   then there are nt any infinitesimal `` gaps '' between the points on a line . with boundary points labeled @xmath9 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "next consider the numbers in the interval @xmath129 that have a binary expansion of up to @xmath130 digits .",
    "these numbers have the general form @xmath131 $ ] , where @xmath132 $ ] is a string of @xmath130 digits ( @xmath9 s or @xmath128 s ) .",
    "the points corresponding to these numbers divide @xmath5 into @xmath133 segments of length @xmath134 . in the limit @xmath135",
    "we obtain all real numbers in @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath137 be any real number and let @xmath138 be a sequence of real numbers such that @xmath139 . if @xmath140 , so that in particular ( in binary notation ) @xmath141 , the assumption that there are infinitesimal line segments between the points on @xmath5 corresponding to the real numbers in @xmath136 leads to a contradiction , for the upper and lower boundaries of those segments are defined by the same number . ]",
    "but if we interpret real numbers as points on a continuous line , or use them to label such points , then it is legitimate to consult the visual image of a continuous line , and to demand that the properties we attribute to the real numbers be consistent with it . and arguably the practice of equating numbers with convergent decimal expansions is not consistent with the continuity of a line in phenomenal space .",
    "denote a string of @xmath130 @xmath128 s .",
    "( we again use binary notation . )",
    "if we visualize the line segment @xmath142 corresponding to the interval @xmath143 , and if we visualize the right end of @xmath142 enlarged by a factor @xmath144 with every increase of @xmath130 by @xmath145 , then the segment @xmath146 corresponding @xmath147 looks exactly the same as @xmath142 . and",
    "this ought to be equally true of the segment @xmath148 corresponding to @xmath149 . ]",
    "be that as it may .",
    "what is clear is that the idea that all conceivable divisions of phenomenal space are intrinsic to physical space , leads naturally to the notion that physical space either contains or is identical with the set @xmath0 .",
    "physicists have long since discarded the democritean notion that the basic material constituents are closed surfaces filled with continuous being .",
    "if they ever entertained the platonic notion that space - dividing surfaces owe their physical reality to forms that have a reality _ ante rem _ , they have long since discarded this notion as well .",
    "what remains to be discarded is ( i )  the notion that space - dividing surfaces are physically real , and ( ii )  the conception of space to which this notion leads if one rejects the democritean and platonic accounts .",
    "sharp space - dividing surfaces exist solely in our minds .",
    "they do not exist as the forms of material objects , for the forms of material objects are sets of more or less indefinite relative positions between formless entities , rather than bounding surfaces ( sec .",
    "3 ) . nor are space - dividing surfaces intrinsic to physical space , as the behavior of electrons in two - slit interference experiments amply demonstrates ( sec .  5 ) .    to bring home",
    "just how insidiously the ccp prevents us from making sense of quantum mechanics , let us examine some of its implications . to begin with , the idea that synchronic multiplicity depends on a partition of space into mutually disjoint regions implies the prior existence of a spatial expanse that gets partitioned or contains the partitions .",
    "the ccp thus prejudices us in favor of _ substantivalism _ , a doctrine that we found to be inconsistent with quantum mechanics . in conjunction with the ccp",
    ", substantivalism implies that not only space but _ each part of space _ is a separate constituent of the world .",
    "if the parts of matter exist by virtue of the parts of space , spatial divisions can not arise from ( processes involving ) matter ; they must be inherent in a preexistent space .",
    "what transpires next depends on whether the world is or is not infinitely divided spacewise .",
    "if the division of space ends with the creation of finite bounded regions , as in the respective theories of democritus and plato , it seems inevitable that we follow these philosophers in attributing the existence of bounded regions to the existence of material objects , and thus conceive of existing boundaries as forms of material objects .",
    "but then the following question arises : why ca nt it happen that different material objects overlap ?",
    "the answer to this question is , because the ccp defines synchronic multiplicity in terms of geometrical divisions .",
    "suppose that there exist two bounded regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 having a finite intersection @xmath150 .",
    "then it is not the case that there exist two material objects whose respective forms are the boundaries of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "instead there exist three such objects whose respective forms are the boundaries of @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the object occupying @xmath11 is _ one _ object ( which may be a part of the object occupying @xmath6 , or a part of the object occupying @xmath7 , or a part of the object occupying @xmath153 ) , rather than _ two _ objects ( a part of the object occupying @xmath6 _ and _ a part of the object occupying @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus it is logically impossible for two objects to overlap ( that is , for a part of one object to occupy the same region of space as a part of another object ) .",
    "material objects , however , move .",
    "this is something that bounded regions of space _ per se _ , considered out of relation to time , can not do , and this raises a further question .",
    "we know that two material objects can not `` overlap '' .",
    "if it seemed as if they did , their apparent intersection would contain a part of either object rather than a part of each object .",
    "if two identical objects came to occupy the same space , they would cease to be two objects .",
    "but this does not explain why we never see a part of one object become numerically identical with a part of another object , or two identical objects merge into one object .",
    "the obvious `` explanation '' of this is that material objects are not only bounded by surfaces but also `` filled to capacity '' with some continuous stuff .",
    "physics offers a different account of the apparent impenetrability of material objects : a repulsive force .",
    "the physical reason why two material objects @xmath114 and @xmath22 lacking common parts can not come to occupy the same space is that their respective parts repel each other .",
    "this explanation involves the spatial relations , or the distances , between the parts of @xmath114 and the parts of @xmath22 , as well as a force opposing attempts to reduce those distances .",
    "it further involves the parts of @xmath114 and the parts of @xmath22 , but only as the relata of those spatial relations .",
    "it does not involve them as bounded regions filled with stuff .",
    "it involves neither the forms of the parts nor any spatially extended stuff .",
    "where physics is concerned , space - filling stuff and forms _ qua _ bounding surfaces are explanatorily irrelevant .",
    "they are artefacts of the ccp and the assumption that the division of space ends with finite bounded regions . in reality , as described by quantum mechanics , there are no bounding surfaces .",
    "forms are made of spatial relations between formless parts . and",
    "if there is stuff , it consists in nothing but the spatial relata the existence of which is implied by the spatial relations .",
    "if the ccp is combined instead with the assumption that the division of space never ends , or ends with infinitesimal regions or with a set of points cardinally equal to the reals , it leads us up a different garden path . in this case",
    "all points or infinitesimal regions are separate constituents of the world , and all physical properties are locally instantiated  they are properties of those points or infinitesimal regions .",
    "the form of an ordinary material object then consists of spatial relations between locally instantiated physical properties .",
    "if we take into account that a generic material object is composed of a finite number of noncomposite entities , we are led to conclude that the form of such an object is made up of the spatial relations between physical properties that are instantiated at a finite number of points or infinitesimal regions .",
    "it stands to reason that these locally instantiated physical properties are the characteristics of a particle species : mass , spin , and charges .",
    "note that a pointlike form is not contained in this list of properties .",
    "saying that a fundamental particle is pointlike is the same as saying that its properties ( not including a form ) are instantiated at a point or an infinitesimal region of space .",
    "it is clear that the spatial relations between these locally instantiated properties can not be indefinite .",
    "the ccp thus makes it impossible to understand how the position of a particle can lack a determinate value .",
    "if the synchronic multiplicity of the world conformed to the ccp , space would be intrinsically and infinitely divided , a noncomposite object could not but exist at a definite point of space or inside a definite infinitesimal region , and the distances between such objects would necessarily be sharp . if , as albert  @xcite has claimed , the behavior of electrons in two - slit experiments is `` quite unlike what we know how to think about '' , it is because we labor under the delusion of the ccp .",
    "if `` [ n]obody knows how it can be like that , '' it is because everybody is deluded by the ccp .",
    "if we could accept that the synchronic multiplicity of the world is based instead on spatial relations , we would have no reason to suppose that spatial relations must have determinate values . on the contrary , taking into account that a finite number of constituents is sufficient for the existence of any known material object , we have reason to suppose that the relative positions of these constituents _ can not _ have determinate values .",
    "in fact , we _ know _ that what `` fluffs out '' matter is not a repulsive force but the indefiniteness of the relative positions of its constituents ( in conjunction with the pauli exclusion principle and the fact that those constituents are fermions ) . if it were not for this indefiniteness  other things being equal  none of the familiar objects around us would exist .",
    "the ccp can lead to worse .",
    "this happens when the quantum state  by definition a system of probability distributions  is construed not only as an instantaneous state of affairs @xmath154 that evolves in an infinitely differentiated time but also as a local state of affairs @xmath155 that assigns physical properties to the point  @xmath75 .",
    "this is done , for instance , by albert  @xcite , who sets out with the following bundle of assumptions : `` suppose that there s just one world . and suppose that there s just one complete story of the world that s true . and suppose that quantum - mechanical state vectors are complete descriptions of physical systems . and",
    "suppose that the dynamical equations of motion are always [ and , presumably , everywhere ] exactly right . ''",
    "the first assumption excludes the many - worlds interpretation  @xcite ; the second rules out the consistent - histories philosophy  @xcite ; the third eliminates bohmian mechanics  @xcite and spontaneous collapse theories  @xcite .",
    "the four assumptions together then lead to the many - minds interpretation  @xcite , or so it is suggested by its proponents .",
    "common to all of these attempts to make sense of quantum mechanics is the idea that the dynamical equations  in the simplest case , the schrdinger equation ; in the case of spontaneous collapse theories , a modified , stochastic equation  are _ always and everywhere _ exactly obeyed , where `` always '' and `` everywhere '' stand for `` at every instant of time '' and `` at every point of space '' , respectively .",
    "since the physical world is not infinitely differentiated spacewise or timewise , these usual acceptations of `` always '' and `` everywhere '' have no meaningful application to the physical world .",
    "for this reason alone all of the above attempts to make sense of quantum mechanics are fatally flawed .",
    "the ccp has neurophysiological underpinnings .",
    "we are adept at recognizing three - dimensional objects in drawings that contain only outlines .",
    "( in fact , we ca nt help but perceive three - dimensional objects .",
    "we always see a necker cube as pointing either in or out . )",
    "why is it so easy to recognize an outline as an object ?",
    "the answer is , because of the way the brain processes visual information . the seminal work of hubel and wiesel  @xcite supports the following account .",
    "visual information flows from retinal receptor cells via retinal ganglion cells to either of two lateral geniculate nuclei , and on to the primary visual cortex .",
    "the receptive field of each retinal ganglion or geniculate cell is divided into either an excitatory center and a concentric inhibitory surround ( the `` on center '' configuration ) or the reverse configuration ( `` off center '' ) .",
    "( the group of retinal receptor cells from which a retinal ganglion or geniculate cell receives input is known as the cell s receptive field . )",
    "thus an `` on center '' cell responds best to a circular spot of light of a specific size , responds well to a bright line that just covers the center ( since then most of the surround is not covered by the line ) , and does not respond at all if both center and surround are fully and equally illuminated .",
    "when visual information reaches the visual cortex , two major transformations take place .",
    "one leads to the fusion of input from both eyes , the other to a rearrangement of incoming information so that most of its cells respond to specifically oriented line segments .",
    "the optimal stimulus may be a bright line on a dark background or the reverse , or it may be a boundary between light and dark regions .",
    "one group of orientation - specific neurons responds best to lines with just the right tilt in a particular part of the visual field .",
    "another group of neurons , receiving input from the first group , is less particular about the position of the line and responds best if the line is swept in a particular direction across the visual field .",
    "these data indicate that the visual representation of a physical environment arises by way of an analysis of the visual field that is based on contrast information from boundaries between homogeneously lit regions .",
    "no sense data arrive from regions that are homogeneously colored and evenly lit .",
    "the interior of such a region is _ filled in _ on the basis of contrast information stemming from its _",
    "boundary_. this explains why outline drawings are readily recognized as objects : the brain adds surfaces to outlines in the same way as it adds ( unperceived ) colored surfaces to ( perceived ) changes in color and brightness across edges",
    ". it also explains why the blind spot is not perceived if it falls inside a homogeneous region ( no sense data arrive from such a region anyway ) , and why color perception is so remarkably faithful to the reflectances of colored surfaces , and correspondingly insensitive to the spectral composition of the actual radiances of such surfaces  @xcite . and most importantly , the manner in which visual information is analyzed by the visual cortex explains why the synchronic multiplicity of the _ phenomenal _ world conforms to the ccp : unlike the physical world , the phenomenal world _ is _ constructed from boundaries , and these are filled in with qualia .",
    "a trivial consequence of this is that two objects in the phenomenal world , unlike two objects in the physical world , can not be at the same place : the existence of two objects in phenomenal space implies the existence of at least one separating boundary .",
    "the phenomenal world differs from the physical world not only in that it is spatially differentiated in conformity with the ccp , but also in that it is intrinsically differentiated .",
    "the visual field is differentiated not only extrinsically by differences in perceived content but also intrinsically by the retinal receptor cells ",
    "it is inherently grainy . that we are unaware of this graininess is another consequence of how the brain processes visual information .",
    "recall that no sense data arrive from uniformly colored regions of the visual field .",
    "such regions are filled in , and are filled in smoothly or homogeneously .",
    "the inherent graininess of boundaries is similarly glossed over .",
    "cells that respond to specifically oriented line segments in a particular part of the visual field receive input from cells that have circular receptive fields with centers lying along a straight line .",
    "the information coming from the latter type of cell is grainy ; the line segment that is perceived when the former type of cell is stimulated , is not .",
    "the phenomenal world thus is intrinsically a world of sharp and continuous boundaries filled with homogeneous content , while the physical world is intrinsically a world of fuzzy spatial relations between relata that , but for their relations , are numerically identical .",
    "there could hardly be a greater difference between the two .",
    "many thinkers have been intrigued , and justifiably so , by the ability of the human mind to reproduce the physical world as faithfully as it does , or seems to do , using nothing but logic and mathematics .",
    "the success of physics is indeed astonishing , but the difficulties we face in understanding quantum mechanics reveal that we are not all that well - equipped mentally . as mcginn",
    "@xcite has stressed , `` [ w]e are , cognitively speaking as well as physically , spatial beings _ par excellence _ : our entire conceptual scheme is shot through with spatial notions , these providing the skeleton of our thought in general . ''",
    "the trouble is that our neurophysiological make - up conditions these spatial notions to conform to the ccp .",
    "recall from note  1 that the neural processes which produce visual percepts and those which produce visual images are to some extent the same . as a consequence ,",
    "every thought about the physical world that involves visual imagery is invariably deceived by some of the neural processes on which it depends .    to conclude , in order to make sense of quantum mechanics",
    ", we must detach our spatial notions from visual imagery .",
    "we must learn to conceive of formless entities .",
    "we must disregard the intrinsic multiplicity of phenomenal space .",
    "we must think of spatial relations as ontologically prior both to forms and to the multiplicity of the corresponding relata .",
    "( without spatial relations , all there is is existence itself .",
    "this takes on the appearance of a world of forms when it enters into spatial relations with itself . )",
    "and we must counter the inherent definiteness of visual percepts and images by resorting to probabilistic concepts and contrary - to - fact conditionals .",
    "last but not least , we must desist from conceiving individuation along lines laid down by the ccp .    according to strawson  @xcite ,",
    "the logical distinction between particular and universal , and hence between subject and predicate , is founded on spatial distinctness .",
    "`` we regard @xmath51 and @xmath156 as distinct particular instances of the same universal @xmath157 just in so far as we acknowledge that @xmath51 and @xmath156 are _ at distinct places _ ''",
    "* original emphasis ) .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us otherwise .",
    "being at distinct places is indeed sufficient for being distinct instances of existence itself , but it is not necessary .",
    "what is necessary for being distinct instances is the existence of a spatial relation .",
    "this can be such that , relative to the laboratory frame , the two instances are not at distinct places . nor can existence itself be thought of as a universal ( sec .  4 ) .",
    "@xmath42 is not the most general predicate but the ultimate subject .",
    "material objects owe their existence to the existence of spatial relations , and these owe their existence not to a predicable universal but to the one existence that they manifoldly relate .",
