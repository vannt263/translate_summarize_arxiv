    "classical novae are a sub - class of cataclysmic variable systems where a roche - lobe - filling star ( typically a cool , near - main - sequence star ) transfers mass to a white dwarf companion ( warner 1995 , 2008 ) . eventually , a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) in the accreted material ensues , which drives substantial mass loss from the system , and leads to the nova eruption ( e.g. starrfield et al . 2008 ) .",
    "absolute magnitudes as bright as m@xmath7 have been observed at the peak of eruption .",
    "their high luminosities and high rates of occurrence ( @xmath8  yr@xmath9 in a galaxy like the milky way [ shafter 2002 ] ) , make novae powerful probes of the evolution of binary systems in different ( extragalactic ) stellar populations .",
    "the most throughly studied extragalactic system is m31 , where more than 700 novae have been discovered since hubble ( 1929 ) began his pioneering work in the early 20th century ( e.g. see darnley et al .",
    "2006 ; pietsch et al . 2007 ;",
    "shafter 2008 , and references therein ) .    in november of 2007 ,",
    "nakano ( 2007 ) reported the discovery of a slowly - rising , and particularly luminous nova in m31 .",
    "the nova , m31  2007 - 11d , was initially detected at @xmath10 ( unfiltered ) on 2007  nov  16.51 before reaching @xmath11 on nov  20.385 .",
    "it was discovered independently by quimby et al .",
    "( 2007 ) as part of the rotse  iiib patrol , and a finding chart based on these data showing the position of m31  2007 - 11d within m31 is shown in figure  1 . according to the compilation of m31 novae by pietsch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , only six ( including m31  2007 - 11d ) of the more than 700 novae recorded in m31 have been observed with @xmath12 . shortly after it became clear that m31  2007 - 11d was an unusually luminous nova , we initiated a series of photometric and spectroscopic observations to follow its subsequent evolution .",
    "here , we report the results of this campaign .",
    "we extensively monitored m31  2007 - 11d with the palomar 60-inch telescope ( p60 ; cenko et al .",
    "2006 ) , the faulkes telescope north ( ftn ; burgdorf et al . 2007 ) , and the 2-m liverpool telescope ( lt ; steele et al .",
    "the p60 observations ( see table  1 ) started on 20.4 nov 2007 ut , four days post - discovery and continued for 21 days until the source faded beyond detectability .",
    "data were reduced within the iraf environment .",
    "imaging was obtained in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 pass bands and photometrically calibrated with respect to sdss . the ftn and lt data ( see table  2 ) were taken through @xmath15 , @xmath16 and sloan @xmath17 filters using the hawkcam and ratcam instruments on the ftn and lt , respectively .",
    "these data were reduced using standard routines within iraf and starlink , and calibrated against standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "in addition to our targeted observations , we have been able to supplement our photometric coverage of m31  2007 - 11d by extracting unfiltered magnitudes from the on - going monitoring of m31 taken as part of the rotse - iiib program ( see table  3 ) , and with photometric measurements made on the night of 25  nov  2007 using the mount laguna observatory ( mlo ) 1-m reflector . for the latter observations",
    ", the field of the nova was imaged with a loral ccd detector through @xmath18 , and @xmath19 filters . as with the ftn and lt data ,",
    "the mlo observations were reduced with standard routines in iraf , and calibrated with standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "m31n  2007 - 11d had faded to @xmath20 by the time of the mlo observations , and was characterized at that time by @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "our comprehensive light curve for m31  2007 - 11d is shown in figure  2 .",
    "in addition to the extensive photometry on the decline from maximum , we have also included some early unfiltered ccd measurements by k. nishiyama and f. kabashima as communicated by nakano , which are useful in establishing the time of maximum light , and in constraining the rise time of the eruption .",
    "the time interval between the initial discovery on 2007  nov  16.51 and the time the nova reached peak brightness on nov  20.4 allows us to set a lower limit of @xmath23 days on the rise to maximum . on the subsequent decline",
    ", the light curve indicates that m31  2007 - 11d was a relatively  fast \" nova , with times to decline by two and three magnitudes ( @xmath16-band ) from maximum light ( @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] ) of 9.5 and 13  days , respectively .",
    "the corresponding decline rate of @xmath26  mag  d@xmath9 is consistent with those of other luminous novae in m31 ( capaccioli et al . 1989 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic observations of m31  2007 - 11d were obtained with both the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and the keck - i telescope .",
    "the het observations were made with the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et al .",
    "1998 ) as part of an on - going spectroscopic survey of novae in m31 .",
    "we used the @xmath27 grating with a 1.0@xmath28 slit and the gg385 blocking filter , which covers 4150 - 11000  with a resolution of @xmath29 , although we limit our analysis to the 4150 - 8900  range where the effects of order overlap are minimal .",
    "the keck - i data were taken in long - slit mode with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke 1995 ) .",
    "lris is a dual beam instrument in which the light is split by a dichroic , and spectra can be obtained in two channels simultaneously .",
    "we obtained 600s exposures with the 400/3400 ( dispersion of @xmath3009 per pixel ) grating and the 400/8500 @xmath3186 per pixel ) grism on the blue and red sides , respectively .",
    "both the het and keck spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines , and are shown in figures  3 and  4 , respectively . for reference with the light curve ,",
    "the dates when these spectra were obtained are indicated in figure  2 .",
    "our initial het spectrum was taken on 21  nov  2007  ut , roughly five days after the nova began to brighten ( @xmath321  day post maximum ) when m31n  2007 - 11d was at @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by balmer , fe  ii , and p  cygni emission features ( fwhm @xmath34 km@xmath9 ) superimposed on a very blue continuum .",
    "these features are characteristic of a nova caught at maximum light , but are unusual for a nova five days post discovery .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to the relatively slow rise to maximum exhibited by m31n  2007 - 11d .",
    "overall , the spectrum is consistent with a classification as an fe  ii nova in the system of williams ( 1992 ) .",
    "a follow - up het spectrum , also shown in figure  3 , was obtained on 04  dec  2007 , 18 days post eruption ( @xmath35 days after maximum ) .",
    "our photometry indicates that the nova had declined to @xmath36 , more than 4 magnitudes from maximum light , and was fading rapidly . as is typical of the early spectral development of novae , the spectrum changed dramatically from that near maximum light , with the fading of the strong blue continuum and the disappearance of the p  cygni profiles .",
    "the spectrum became dominated by strong balmer ( fwhm @xmath32 2300  km  s@xmath9 ) , fe  ii and o  i lines in emission , confirming the identification of m31n  2007 - 11d as an fe  ii - type nova .",
    "our final spectrum ( figure  4 ) was obtained on 11.5 dec 2007 ut after m31n  2007 - 11d had faded to well below @xmath37 . by this time",
    "most emission features had faded significantly , with only residual h@xmath38 emission ( fwhm @xmath32 1800  km  s@xmath9 ) being clearly detected .",
    "through the end of 2007 , a total of 779 novae have been discovered in m31 since hubble s observations began nearly a century ago ( hubble 1929 ) . of these",
    ", 732 novae have measured magnitudes ( pietsch et al .",
    "the interpretation of these data is complicated by the fact that not all novae were observed on the same photometric system , or in the same bandpass .",
    "most of the early observations yielded photographic magnitudes , with much of the later data yielding either unfiltered or h@xmath38 magnitudes .",
    "typically , observations have been reported in one or more of the @xmath39 ( unfiltered ) , and h@xmath38 bandpasses .    in order to better compare the data , we have attempted to convert all individual photometric observations to a reddening - free visual magnitude , @xmath40 .",
    "we began this process by correcting all observations for foreground extinction using a reddening of @xmath41 along the line of sight to m31 found by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . from this , we estimate @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , where the h@xmath38 and @xmath47 ( unfiltered ) ccd magnitudes have been treated as @xmath19-band measurements since the effective wavelengths are similar . after correcting for extinction , we converted all observations to the visual band by adopting representative colors for a typical nova shortly after eruption .",
    "van den bergh & younger ( 1986 ) have shown that the mean colors of galactic novae are given by @xmath48@xmath49@xmath50 at maximum light , and @xmath48@xmath49@xmath51 by the time the average nova had faded two magnitudes below maximum .",
    "since we expect that the typical m31 nova will have faded somewhat by the time of discovery , here we adopt @xmath48@xmath49@xmath52 as a plausible estimate for the color at the time of the photometric measurements .",
    "this value is consistent with the de - reddened color of m31n  2007 - 11d , @xmath53 , based on our mlo observations obtained @xmath54 days post maximum . according to the data compiled by johnson ( 1966 ) ,",
    "this is the approximate color of an a5v star , which is also characterized by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "since the energy distribution of a nova near maximum light is similar to a blackbody , we can use these color indicies to convert all m31 nova observations to a de - reddened @xmath16 magnitude ( photographic magnitudes were initially converted to @xmath58 magnitudes using the relationship , @xmath59_0=0.27 - 0.19~[b - v]_0 $ ] from arp [ 1961 ] ) .    given the distance of m31 ( @xmath60 ; freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) , our values of @xmath40 result in the absolute magnitude distribution shown in figure  5 , with the position of m31  2007 - 11d ( @xmath61 ) indicated by the arrow .",
    "it is important to note that since the photometric measurements of m31 novae were not all obtained precisely at maximum light , this distribution is only an approximation to the true maximum magnitude distribution of novae in m31 .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that the majority of systems were observed near maximum , particularly for novae at the brighter end of the distribution .",
    "clearly , m31  2007 - 11d , which we estimate reached an absolute magnitude at maximum light of @xmath61 , is one of the brightest novae to erupt in m31 over the past century .",
    "there has been a growing body of evidence from both galactic and extragalactic observations that there may exist two separate populations of novae ( e.g. , see shafter 2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "this conjecture is based primarily on three principal findings : ( 1 ) the frequency distribution of nova magnitudes at maximum light from the arp ( 1956 ) m31 nova survey is bimodal , possibly as a result of two distinct populations of progenitor systems ( there is also some evidence for bimodality in the rosino [ 1973 ] m31 survey , but it is less compelling ) , ( 2 ) galactic observations suggesting that novae associated with the disk may be on average faster and more luminous than novae thought to be associated with the bulge ( e.g. duerbeck 1990 ; della valle et al . 1992 ) , ( 3 ) the distribution of the rates of decline for novae in the lmc suggesting that these novae are on average  faster \" than those in the bulge of m31 ( della valle & duerbeck 1993 ) , and ( 4 ) the realization that novae can be divided into two principal classes based upon their spectroscopic properties ( williams 1992 ) .",
    "novae with prominent fe  ii lines ( the fe  ii novae ) usually show p  cygni absorption profiles , and tend to evolve more slowly , have lower expansion velocities , have a lower level of ionization , compared with novae that exhibit strong lines of he and n ( the he",
    "/ n novae ) .",
    "later , della valle & livio ( 1998 ) noted that galactic novae that were classified as he / n were concentrated near the galactic plane , and tended to be faster , and more luminous compared with their fe  ii counterparts .    assuming that the bimodal magnitude distribution seen by arp ( 1956 ) and later emphasized by capaccioli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is in fact real , it is perhaps surprising that the absolute magnitude distribution for our much larger sample of m31 novae shown in figure  5 shows no evidence for bimodality",
    ". it may be possible to attribute this discrepancy to the fact that many of the m31 novae in our sample likely had faded somewhat by the time of discovery , in which case , as noted earlier , the absolute magnitudes used to construct figure  5 do not all correspond to maximum light .",
    "nevertheless , given the likelihood that the majority of novae were observed near peak brightness , it would seem reasonable to expect some trace of bimodality in the distribution to remain .",
    "another approach to testing for the existence of two distinct nova populations is to compare the absolute magnitude distribution of the m31 novae with similar distributions for the galaxy and the lmc .",
    "novae in m31 are thought to arise mainly from the galaxy s bulge population ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1998 , cappacioli et al .",
    "1989 , shafter & irby 2001 , darnley et al .",
    "2006 ) , while those in the galaxy and in the lmc are associated primarily with a younger stellar population .",
    "although galactic novae occur both in the bulge and disk , the observed nova sample is biased by relatively nearby objects , which are mostly members of the disk population",
    ". similarly , novae in the lmc have been found to belong primarily to a young population , with progenitors estimated to be in the age range of @xmath62  gyrs ( subramaniam & anupama 2002 ) .",
    "if novae arising from a younger stellar population are on average more luminous than their bulge counterparts , this difference should be reflected in the luminosity distributions for the three galaxies .    to test this possibility , absolute magnitude distributions for galactic and lmc novae",
    "have been included in figure  5 for comparison with the m31 distribution .",
    "the galactic data come from directly the compilations of downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) and shafter ( 1997 ) , while the lmc nova luminosities have been computed from the apparent magnitudes given in shida & liller ( 2004 ) assuming @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "although the galactic and m31 magnitude distributions agree reasonably well at the bright end as expected , the mean absolute magnitudes of the galactic and lmc samples ( @xmath48@xmath65@xmath66 and @xmath48@xmath65@xmath67 , respectively ) are significantly brighter than the mean of the m31 sample ( @xmath48@xmath65@xmath68 ) . as just alluded to with regard to the lack of bimodality in the overall magnitude distribution , it is likely that some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that many m31 novae have faded somewhat from maximum light by the time of discovery .",
    "in addition , extinction internal to m31 , for which we have made no correction , will also lower our estimates of the m31 nova luminosities .",
    "however , it is also possible that part of the discrepancy is real , and that it results from the differences in the underlying nova populations . in this case , since the hubble type of m31 ( sb ) is significantly earlier than that of the lmc ( irr  i ) and slightly earlier than that of the galaxy ( sbc ) , m31 would be expected to contain a greater fraction of bulge novae compared with the latter galaxies .      in tables 4 , 5 , and  6 we summarize properties of novae in the galaxy , m31 , and the lmc , that have reached absolute visual magnitudes brighter than @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to their absolute magnitudes , we have listed , when available , data for the rise time to maximum light , @xmath70 , the time to fade by two magnitudes from maximum light , @xmath1 , and the spectroscopic class .",
    "novae exhibit a well - known relationship between their peak luminosity and their rate of decline known as the maximum - magnitude vs. rate - of - decline ( mmrd ) relation ( mclaughlin 1945 , della valle & livio 1995 , downes & duerbeck 2000 ) . in his discussion of nova",
    "lmc  1991 , della valle ( 1991 ) pointed out that several novae , in addition to nova lmc  1991 reached peak luminosities about a magnitude brighter than than expected from the mean mmrd relation .",
    "he concluded that a distinct  super - bright \" population of novae may exist .    to explore this possibility further , and to see where m31n  2007 - 11d fits into this picture , in figure  6",
    "we have plotted the peak luminosities ( @xmath71 $ ] ) and corresponding fade rates ( @xmath1 ) for our samples of luminous galactic , m31 and lmc novae . since our samples",
    "are restricted to @xmath72 , the plot only shows the bright end of the mmrd relation ( i.e. , less luminous novae lying in the shaded region are not shown ) . to better assess the fit to the full mmrd relation , the reader is referred to the studies by della valle & livio ( 1995 ) and downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) . despite its limitations ,",
    "figure  6 reveals that there is considerable scatter at the bright end of the luminosity function with little correlation of the maximum magnitude with @xmath1 . both m31n",
    "2007 - 11d and nova lmc  1991 are close to a magnitude brighter than predicted by the non - linear mmrd relation of della valle & livio ( 1995 ) ( less so for the linear relation of downes & duerbeck [ 2000 ] for galactic novae ) , but it is not clear that they form part of a separate class of super - bright novae .",
    "this view is supported by the luminosity distribution shown in figure  5 , where no evidence for a separate class is seen .",
    "instead , we argue that the scatter seen in figure  6 results from a combination of observational uncertainties ( e.g. , in extinction corrections ) coupled with the intrinsic variability one expects from a population of novae with a distribution of fundamental properties ( e.g. , white dwarf masses , mass accretion rates , metallicites , etc . ) .    as mentioned earlier , there is evidence that the lmc novae fade more quickly ( i.e. have a lower mean @xmath1 ) compared with galactic and m31 novae . the data for luminous novae from tables  46 appear to be consistent with this picture with @xmath48@xmath1@xmath73 days , @xmath48@xmath1@xmath74 days , and @xmath48@xmath1@xmath75 days , for the galaxy , m31 , and the lmc respectively .",
    "furthermore , referring to table  6 , we see that in the lmc a total of four novae ( perhaps five if v2434-lmc is included ) have @xmath76 .",
    "this number is quite high given that a total of only @xmath77 novae have been discovered in the lmc ( shida & liller 2004 ) .",
    "thus , luminous novae ( @xmath76 ) appear to make up roughly 12% of the total .",
    "in contrast , only a dozen ( @xmath78% ) out of the 127 galactic novae with measured luminosities ( @xmath325% of all galactic novae ) , and only 26 out of the 732 m31 novae ( @xmath23% ) have similarly high luminosities . finally , it is interesting to note that although fe  ii novae make up the vast majority ( @xmath3280% ) of all galactic novae ( shafter 2007b ) , only three of the 12 galactic novae with @xmath79 are members of the fe  ii class .",
    "the remaining four systems are either he / n novae , or hybrid ( hy ) objects thought to be related to the he / n systems . the lmc data , while limited , support the conclusion that the he / n novae are overrepresented among the luminous novae .",
    "spectroscopic data for luminous novae in m31 are also limited , but preliminary data again suggest that he / n novae tend to be slightly more luminous that the fe  ii systems ( shafter et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) . in m31 generally ,",
    "shafter ( 2007a ) found that @xmath80% of m31 novae with measured spectra fall into the he / n class , which is comparable to , but slightly smaller than the percentage seen in the galaxy .",
    "if this difference is found to be statistically significant , it is possible that the slightly higher fraction of he / n novae observed in the galaxy ( and possibly in the lmc ) is reflecting either the selection bias in favor of  disk \" novae , or the slightly later hubble types of the milky way and the lmc compared with m31 , or both .",
    "in addition to its classification as an unusually luminous fe  ii nova , m31n  2007 - 11d may be atypical in another respect . in comparison with most galactic novae",
    ", the timescale of its rise to maximum light ( @xmath5  days ) appears at first glance to be atypically slow for such a luminous nova .",
    "although observations of the rise to maximum in galactic novae are fragmentary , the existing observations seem to indicate that essentially all novae reach maximum light within three days ( payne - gaposchkin 1957 , warner 1995 , 2008 ) . for the fastest ( and most luminous )",
    "novae , the rise to maximum is believed to be less than two days , and in the case of v1500 cyg , may have been less than a day ( liller et al . 1975 ) .",
    "the scarcity of pre - maximum data can be attributed to the rapid rise , which results in most novae being discovered either at , or more typically shortly after , maximum light .",
    "strictly speaking , the rise time estimates given in table  4 are best considered lower limits since pre - maximum observations do not often extend more than a few magnitudes below maximum light . although the statistics are poor , it is interesting to note that of the seven novae for which rise times can be constrained , the two fe  ii novae appear to have taken the longest time to reach peak brightness .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the similarly slow rise to maximum observed in m31n  2007 - 11d might be related to its fe  ii nature .",
    "the dearth of reliable data on the rise times of galactic novae is in part a result of how these objects are discovered : usually serendipitously , often in patrols for solar system bodies such as comets and asteroids . on the other hand , most m31 and lmc novae have been discovered in targeted surveys , some of which may have sufficiently frequent temporal sampling to better constrain a nova s rise time to peak brightness . referring to tables  5 and  6",
    "we see that sufficient data are available for about half of these novae to establish that rise times of up to four days are perhaps not as uncommon as the galactic data would suggest .",
    "one nova in particular , nova lmc  1991 , stands out as being remarkably similar to m31n  2007 - 11d .",
    "nova lmc  1991 is the brightest nova to be observed in the lmc ( and one of the brightest extragalactic novae on record ) , reaching @xmath81 . despite its high luminosity ,",
    "nova lmc  1991 took an usually long time to reach maximum light ( @xmath82  days ) ; and , like m31n  2007 - 11d , has been classified as a member of the fe  ii spectroscopic class ( williams et al .",
    "schwarz et al . (",
    "2001 ) have modeled the spectral evolution of of nova lmc  1991 during eruption and concluded that the luminosity was super - eddington before visual maximum , and that the ejected mass was @xmath83  m@xmath84 , which is about an order of magnitude larger than that normally observed in  fast \" novae .",
    "they argued that the high luminosity and large ejected mass resulted from accretion of low metallicity material onto a relatively cool , high - mass white dwarf .",
    "the low metallicity allows more material to be accumulated before a tnr is triggered than would otherwise be possible for accretion onto a massive white dwarf .",
    "the result is an energetic eruption characterized by a high shell mass and a relatively slow photometric evolution .",
    "it is plausible that m31n  2007 - 11d represents a similar system .    in view of available evidence , we conclude that the rise time of @xmath324 days observed in m31n  2007 - 11d may not be as atypical as initially assumed , and is likely the result of a relatively high ejected mass .",
    "unfortunately , with the exceptions of m31n  2007 - 11d and nova lmc  1991 , few spectroscopic classifications are available for other luminous novae with well - determined rise times .",
    "thus , at present , we can not draw any firm conclusions regarding possible correlations between spectroscopic class and the rise time to maximum light .",
    "our principal conclusions can be summarized as follows :      \\2 ) extensive photometry obtained on the subsequent decline from maximum light showed that the nova could be classified as a relatively  fast \" nova , that took @xmath3 and @xmath4 days to by decline 2 and 3 magnitudes from maximum light , respectively .",
    "\\3 ) spectroscopic observations obtained the day following maximum light , and then again @xmath86 and @xmath87 weeks post maximum reveal relatively narrow ( fwhm @xmath88  km  s@xmath9 ) balmer and fe  ii emission lines that clearly establish m31n  2007 - 11d as a member of the fe  ii class in william s ( 1992 ) system .",
    "\\4 ) among the most luminous galactic novae with @xmath79 , only one in four is of the fe  ii type despite the fact that @xmath89% of all galactic novae are members of this class .",
    "thus , m31n  2007 - 11d appears to be relatively rare in this respect .",
    "\\5 ) the photometric and spectroscopic properties of m31n  2007 - 11d appear to be remarkably similar to that of another extragalactic nova , nova lmc  1991 ( della valle 1991 , schwarz et al .",
    "in particular , both were fe  ii novae that reached absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath90 , and were characterized by relatively slow rises to maximum light .",
    "\\6 ) although there is considerable scatter at the upper end of the mmrd relation , we find no compelling evidence for a _ distinct _ class of super - bright novae .",
    "the large scatter in luminosity among novae with @xmath76 in figure  6 , coupled with the smooth drop - off in the luminosity distribution in figure  5 , is consistent with the uniform variation expected from a combination of observational uncertainties and intrinsic variability in fundamental nova parameters .",
    "\\7 ) the rise time to maximum light for galactic novae is poorly constrained , but has been generally regarded to be of order one to two days for the most luminous novae . a comparison with available data for luminous m31 and lmc novae such as m31n  2007 - 11d and nova lmc",
    "1991 shows rise times up to 4 days may not be unusual , and suggests that galactic nova rise times may have been underestimated .",

    "<S> the time for the nova to decline 2 and 3 magnitudes from maximum light ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) was @xmath3 and @xmath4  days , respectively , establishing that m31n  2007 - 11d was a moderately fast declining nova . during the nova s evolution </S>",
    "<S> a total of three spectra were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the first spectrum was obtained one day after maximum light ( 5 days post - discovery ) , followed by two additional spectra taken on the decline at two and three weeks post - maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the initial spectrum reveals narrow balmer and fe  ii emission with p  cygni profiles superimposed on a blue continuum . </S>",
    "<S> these data along with the spectra obtained on the subsequent decline clearly establish that m31n  2007 - 11d belongs to the fe  ii spectroscopic class . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of m31n  2007 - 11d are discussed within the context of other luminous novae in m31 , the galaxy , and the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> overall , m31n  2007 - 11d appears to be remarkably similar to nova lmc  1991 , which was another bright , slowly - rising , fe  ii nova . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the available data for luminous extragalactic novae suggest that the @xmath5 day rise to maximum light seen in m31n  2007 - 11d may not be unusual , and that the rise times of luminous galactic novae , usually assumed to be @xmath6 days , may have been underestimated . </S>"
