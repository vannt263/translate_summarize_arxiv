    "boundary - layer theory , first introduced by ludwig prandtl in 1904 , is now fundamental to many applications of fluid mechanics , especially aerodynamics .    consider the case of two - dimensional steady incompressible viscous flow near a flat surface .",
    "let @xmath0 be the coordinate along the horizontal surface , @xmath1 be the coordinate normal to the surface , and @xmath2 be the corresponding velocity of the flow .",
    "near the wall @xmath3 is significantly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "also , @xmath3 changes in @xmath1 much faster than it does in the @xmath0 coordinate . then , in the case of a zero pressure gradient , the following prandtl equations are used to approximate the navier - stokes equations .",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 is a kinematic viscosity ; density is chosen to be identically one .",
    "a classical example of the boundary layer is a flow near the semi - infinite plate @xmath7 . in 1908",
    ", blasius discovered that in this case there exists a similarity variable @xmath8 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : prandtl ] ) can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation @xmath9 with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 as @xmath12 . then @xmath13 are solutions of ( [ eq : prandtl ] ) and they match experimental data in the laminar boundary layer . here",
    "@xmath14 is the horizontal velocity component of the external flow , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .    for high local reynolds numbers",
    "@xmath17 the flow becomes turbulent and analogs of the equations ( [ eq : prandtl ] ) and ( [ blasiusode ] ) were not known . in this paper",
    "we use navier - stokes - alpha model of fluid turbulence also known as viscous camassa - holm equations to study averaged flow , and obtain turbulent boundary layer equations that generalize ( [ eq : prandtl ] ) and ( [ blasiusode ] ) . our reduction to an ordinary differential equation ( see ( [ eq:1d ] ) ) also uses blasius s similarity variable .",
    "alpha - model was first introduced in @xcite as a generalization to @xmath18 dimensions of the one - dimensional camassa - holm equation that describes shallow water waves .",
    "later , ns-@xmath19 model was proposed as a closure approximation for the reynolds equations , and its solutions were compared with empirical data for turbulent flows in channels and pipes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we study two - dimensional steady incompressible viscous flow near a flat surface .",
    "let @xmath0 be the coordinate along the surface , @xmath1 be the coordinate normal to the surface .",

    "in addition , assume that @xmath34 does nt depend on @xmath1 variable . after neglecting terms with high powers of @xmath35 ,",
    "dropping subscripts and denoting @xmath36 we derive the following turbulent boundary layer equations that generalize prandtl equations : @xmath37 note that derivative of @xmath38 is not zero in @xmath1-direction .",
    "therefore , we introduce @xmath39 and obtain the following equations : @xmath40    consider now a case of a two - dimensional steady incompressible viscous flow near the semi - infinite plate @xmath7 .",
    "the following assumptions are made in this case :    * @xmath41 * zero pressure gradient , i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we will study the solutions @xmath43 of ( [ eq : gprandtl ] ) , which on some adequate interval @xmath44 are of the form @xmath45    let @xmath46 then @xmath47 , and we have the following equation for @xmath48 : @xmath49 the boundary conditions are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "note that if @xmath52 is a solution of ( [ eq:1d ] ) , then @xmath53 is a solution of @xmath54 this equation can be also written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",

    "it is common to use @xmath64 in the turbulent boundary layer , where @xmath65 fix @xmath0 on the horizontal axis and denote @xmath66 , @xmath16 . as argued in the section [ sec : derivation ]",

    "in addition , @xmath71 given @xmath72 , a skin - friction coefficient and @xmath73 , a reynolds number based on momentum thickness we find @xmath74 , @xmath58 , and @xmath17 so that the following conditions hold :      a family of curves @xmath77 was compared with experimental data of rolls - royce applied science laboratory , ercoftac t3b test case ( see fig .",
