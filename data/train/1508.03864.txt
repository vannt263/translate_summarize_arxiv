    "recent transient experiments probing the thermal transport properties of materials on short length- and/or time - scales have reported deviations from expected classical theory , which often corresponds to a reduction in extracted thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "this has largely been attributed to quasi - ballistic phonon transport , arising when the phonon mean - free - path ( mfp ) is similar to or greater than the characteristic length scale in the experiment .",
    "traditional diffusion heat equations are commonly relied upon for analyzing raw data and extracting thermal properties , but the classical heat equations are widely believed to break down under conditions of non - diffusive transport . this paper addresses the need for fast and accurate techniques to analyze transient thermal measurements .    to capture ballistic behavior ,",
    "theoretical efforts have largely focused on using rigorous approaches such as the phonon boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) .",
    "such detailed numerical studies @xcite can be too computationally demanding for the routine analysis of experiments .",
    "the phonon bte can , however , also provide a starting point for deriving simple models to elucidate the relationship between the intrinsic phonon properties of a material ( e.g. phonon mfp ) and the measured thermal transport characteristics @xcite .",
    "these simple models are often problem - specific  assuming simplified geometries and material structures .",
    "moreover they are not straightfowardly compatible with traditional analysis approaches , and must often be used as post - processing tools to analyze the extracted thermal properties .",
    "ideally one would like to have an approach that captures ballistic effects , but that can also be applied to a wide class of problems , readily handle material structures similar to the experimental setup and that can be used to analyze raw data . such a technique is described in this paper .    in our previous work , we showed that steady - state and transient diffusion equations can capture ballistic phonon effects as long as the correct physical boundary conditions are used .",
    "when properly implemented , diffusion equations provide good agreement with the phonon bte @xcite . in this paper , we extend previous work to the periodic steady - state case and analyze ballistic effects in model transient thermoreflectance experiments using diffusion equations .",
    "we compare diffusion equation solutions to recently - reported rigorous numerical results of the phonon bte and find excellent agreement .",
    "we also demonstrate how this approach readily supports the inclusion of detailed phonon properties , including a full phonon dispersion and mfp distribution . finally ,",
    "as an illustration of the technique , we consider a simple model problem using two different , commonly - used heating conditions .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the different cases produce different results , but we also show that the quantities that would be measured in an experiment are insensitive to the specific heating condition , at least for this simple , model problem .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the range of problems that can be addressed with diffusion equations is much broader than has been generally understood .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] presents the problem under consideration and describes our theoretical approach .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows our solutions for the model structure , compares our solutions to those obtained from the phonon bte , and applies the technique to bulk silicon using detailed material properties .",

    "in this work we model a simple structure comprised of a semi - infinite ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1@xmath3 ) semiconductor / insulator slab , driven by periodic harmonic heating at the surface ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "actual structures in thermoreflectance experiments are more complicated @xcite , and modeling such experiments requires considering , for example , the metal transducer and the finite size of the heating source in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane at the surface .",
    "we chose a simple structure to more easily illustrate and analyze the role of ballistic phonon effects , to demonstrate how such effects are captured by diffusion equations , and to compare to rigorous numerical solutions of the phonon bte @xcite .    with time - domain thermoreflectance ( tdtr ) the heating at the surface is driven by a train of short laser pulses ( @xmath7 ps or fs ) that are modulated at a given frequency ( @xmath8 1 - 10 mhz ) , while with frequency - domain thermoreflectance ( fdtr ) the heating at the surface is generated by a modulated continous laser stream ( @xmath8 1 - 100 mhz ) . here , we consider the simpler case of periodic harmonic heating , similar to the conditions of fdtr , although it is possible to also calculate the tdtr response since both are mathematically connected @xcite .",
    "we begin with the mckelvey - shockley flux method @xcite , which was shown to treat phonon transport from the ballistic to diffusive transport regime @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the forward / backward heat fluxes , @xmath11 is the mean - free - path for backscattering , @xmath12 is the average @xmath2-projected velocity , and @xmath13 is the phonon energy .",

    "although our approach is written in terms of phonon energy @xmath13 , if preferred , it is possible and equivalent to deal with phonon frequency by making the substitution @xmath18 .    under conditions of small temperature variations ,",

    "( note that the temperature in these equations is the average of the temperature of the forward and reverse heat fluxes . )",
    "these equations are modified versions of the heat equation and fourier s law that capture finite - velocity propagation @xcite .",
    "while these diffusion equations are widely believed to break down when ballistic effects are present , we showed that this is not the case @xcite . here",
    "we will solve the hhe and cattaneo eq . to study the role of ballistic effects in frequency - dependent thermal transport .",
    "since periodic harmonic oscillations are driving the heating at the surface , one can show that the solutions for temperature and heat current will have the form @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . inserting these expressions in the hhe and cattaneo eq . , we obtain the following new equations : @xmath26 which can be viewed as modified versions of the heat equation and fourier s law , and as @xmath27@xmath28@xmath0 we retrieve these classic expressions .",
    "we can see how the heat current will be reduced by the denominator at high frequency compared to that predicted by fourier s law .",

    "( [ bc : iq ] ) ) is the same in the traditional limit ( i.e. with no ballistic effects ) , however for the @xmath20-controlled case the boundary condition ( eq . ( [ bc : temp ] ) ) differs from the traditional limit due to the term with @xmath136 .",
    "this extra term , responsible for the temperature jump at the surface , drives the full solution away from the traditional solution at a lower frequency compared to the @xmath34-controlled case . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) the transition frequency is 1.4@xmath7810@xmath123 hz for the @xmath20-controlled case , while no deviation from the traditional solution is observed for the @xmath34-controlled case ( boundary condition for both the full and traditional solutions are the same ) .",
    "when analyzing experimental data , several factors should be considered .",
    "for example , it is not clear , which case ( @xmath20- or @xmath34-controlled ) should be used at the surface of the semiconductor .",
    "we note , though , that phase lag is a key quantity in the analysis of fdtr and tdtr experiments , and that our results indicate phase is insensitive to the adopted heating type .",
    "one - dimensional solutions are also probably not adequate , and it is not clear if and how the metal itself and the metal - semiconductor junction should be treated @xcite . the diffusive - to - ballistic transition frequencies reported here are quite high , which could be a result of the simplified model we used to demontrate the technique .",
    "we have shown that when the correct physical boundary conditions are used , the hhe and cattaneo equation ( i.e. diffusion equations ) can be used to model ballistic effects in frequency - dependent transient thermal transport .",
    "our analytical solutions , derived for the case of temperature- and heat current - controlled heating at the surface , are found to reproduce rigorous solutions of the phonon bte with high accuracy .",
    "numerical solutions of the bte were available for only 1d transport problems within the gray approximation , so our approach remains to be tested in cases where a treatment of angle - dependent phonon transport is required and scattering is handled beyond the relaxation time approximation .    by calculating the thermal transport response of bulk silicon , we demonstrated how the approach can easily handle a full phonon dispersion and energy - dependent mfp distribution when the energy channels are treated as independent .",
    "testing the gray approximation , we found that it performs resonably well at the semiconductor / insulator surface , but it fails to accurately describe the temperature profile inside the material .",
    "an advantage of this simple approach based on solving diffusion equations is its physical transparency .",
    "for example , we discussed how results can be explained in terms of the directed temperatures , @xmath73 , ( the temperature of each half of the phonon distribution ) and how a large splitting of @xmath85 and @xmath86 results from the nonequilibrium nature of ballistic transport .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that diffusion equations have the potential for accurately treating ballistic to diffusive thermal transport .",
    "this work was supported in part by darpa meso ( grant n66001 - 11 - 1 - 4107 ) and through the ncn - needs program , which is funded by the national science foundation , contract 1227020-eec , and the semiconductor research corporation .",
    "here we derive the correct physical boundary conditions , that come from the phonon bte , to be used when solving the hhe and the cattaneo equation .",
    "below we consider two cases : when heating at the surface is driven by a controlled temperature or a controlled heat current .",
    "our starting point are the directed heat fluxes @xmath32 used in the mckelvey - shockley equations , and how to rewrite the boundary conditions for @xmath32 into boundary conditions for @xmath20 and @xmath34 . instead of dealing with @xmath32 we can work with the directed phonon temperatures @xmath137 @xcite ( i.e. temperature of each half of the phonon distribution ) , where @xmath138 is the variation in directed heat flux around the background equilibrium flux and @xmath72 is the background temperature .",
    "we begin by writing two general expressions that relate @xmath73 to @xmath20 and @xmath34 @xcite : @xmath139 / 2 , \\\\",
    "i_q(x , t ) & = k^{\\rm ball } \\left [ t^+(x , t ) - t^-(x , t ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by eliminating @xmath86 , we find @xmath140 using @xmath141 @xcite with the cattaneo equation , we obtain @xmath142 for the temperature - controlled case , where the surface of the semiconductor / insulator is joined to a thermal reservoir via an ideal reflectionless contact , the temperature of the injected phonons is equal to the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "this gives the boundary condition that is eq .",
    "( [ bc : temp ] ) . for the heat",
    "current - controlled case , the hhe and cattaneo equation can be solved using @xmath143 ( eq . ( [ bc : iq ] ) ) , which states that @xmath144 must be a constant .",
    "as shown in the main text and in ref .",
    "@xcite the thermal relaxation time is written as @xmath21 .",
    "the mean - free - path for backscattering and average @xmath2-projected velocity are defined as @xcite @xmath145 where @xmath66 is the phonon scattering time , @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the phonon energy dispersion relation ( related to the phonon frequency dispersion through @xmath148 ) , @xmath49 is a vector in reciprocal space , and the summation over @xmath49 is restricted to the brillouin zone . using the above relations for @xmath77 and @xmath17 and inserting them into our expression for @xmath27 we find @xmath149 thus @xmath27",
