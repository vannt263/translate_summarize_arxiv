    "gluon fusion is the dominant production mechanism for higgs bosons at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( for reviews , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "a feature of the gluon fusion process is that it is loop - mediated already at leading order .",
    "this makes it particularly sensitive to non - standard particles and couplings as they are predicted by extended theories .",
    "a very popular extension of the standard model ( sm ) is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) , with its five physical higgs bosons .",
    "we will focus on a scenario where the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets is not too large , @xmath0 , ( @xmath1=top mass , @xmath2=bottom mass ) , so that the bottom is much smaller than the top yukawa coupling . in this case ,",
    "the dominant effects on the gluon ",
    "higgs coupling in the mssm arise from the top quark @xmath3 and its scalar supersymmetric ( susy ) partner , the top squark @xmath4 .",
    "susy - qcd corrections are induced by virtual gluons @xmath5 and their fermionic susy partners , the gluinos @xmath6 .",
    "these effects have recently  @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) been evaluated at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the limit where @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes either of the two cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "this limit is expected to work extremely well , if the leading order ( lo ) dependence on @xmath11 is taken into account exactly .",
    "this can be inferred from the nlo behavior in the sm  @xcite .    in the effective lagrangian approach ,",
    "the evaluation of the hadronic higgs cross section factorizes into the calculation of the effective gluon  higgs coupling , times the calculation of the actual process @xmath12 as mediated by the effective gluon  higgs operator . for a full next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )",
    "result in this approach , both factors need to be evaluated up to nnlo .",
    "however , in the sm , the nnlo contribution of the effective coupling leads to a numerically negligible contribution , and we will argue that this is true also in the mssm . the nnlo higgs production cross section can therefore be evaluated from the nlo expression of the effective coupling , as taken from ref.@xcite , and the nnlo results for the process diagrams , which are identical to the sm case  @xcite .",
    "we use the effective lagrangian approach where the top quark and all supersymmetric particles are considered heavy with respect to the higgs boson , see  ref.@xcite . in this case",
    ", the hadronic cross section @xmath13 for higgs production can be written as @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote any partons inside the hadrons @xmath9 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the parton densities ; @xmath20 is the higgs boson mass , and @xmath21 is the hadronic center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath22 , defined below , contains the remnant dependence of the gluon ",
    "higgs coupling on the heavy masses , and @xmath23 is defined such that the leading order dependence on these masses of @xmath24 is exact .",
    "its exact form is irrelevant for our argument and shall not be given here , owing to space limitations ( see , e.g.  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the partonic expression can be expanded in terms of @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the partonic c.m .  energy . here and in what follows",
    ", @xmath25 denotes the @xmath29-renormalized strong coupling constant for five active quark flavors , evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath30 .    for the coefficient function , we write @xmath31\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq::coef } \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the sm , the @xmath32 are known for @xmath33  @xcite ( @xmath34 contributes only at n@xmath35lo ) . in the mssm",
    ", @xmath36 has been evaluated only recently  @xcite .",
    "we now define @xmath37 for the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , we assume that the parton densities @xmath40 are evaluated at nnlo . thus , the nnlo expression for the hadronic cross section can be written as @xmath41\\ , , \\label{eq::sigmannlo } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath42 have been dropped for simplicity",
    ". the basis of our estimate of the nnlo terms in susy will be that the numerical effect of the term proportional to @xmath43 in eq.([eq::sigmannlo ] ) is negligible compared to the theoretical uncertainty of the nnlo prediction .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the nnlo result in the mssm is given by the narrow ( red ) band , arising from the variation of @xmath43 between zero and @xmath44 ( see eq.([eq::cism ] ) ) .",
    "this should serve as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty induced by the approximation introduced in sect.[sec::app ] . within our approximations , the k - factor in fig.[fig::kss14nnlo ] is valid for both cp - even higgs bosons of the mssm , since the yukawa coupling cancels in the ratio of the lo to the higher order results .    as at nlo ,",
    "the susy effects are small with respect to the qcd effects at nnlo , so that the total k - factor in the mssm is very similar to its sm value .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties due to variation of the renormalization and factorization scales are almost identical to the sm case , since the only source of additional scale dependence in the mssm arises from @xmath43 . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of the nnlo prediction is indicated in fig.[fig::kss14nnlo ] as the diagonally shaded band ; the @xmath46 dependence is much smaller .",
    "we have discussed an approximation for the nnlo contributions to supersymmetric higgs production in gluon fusion . it was argued that the corresponding nnlo estimate should be accurate up to a few per cent , which is much smaller than the theoretical uncertainty induced by the residual renormalization and factorization scale dependence , as well as the anticipated experimental accuracy . for a given set of susy parameters , and within the restrictions on these parameters as discussed in the main text , the production cross section for a higgs boson in the mssm is thus known to a precision similar to that in the sm .",
    "more detailed studies of the mssm parameter space are clearly desirable and will be presented elsewhere .",
