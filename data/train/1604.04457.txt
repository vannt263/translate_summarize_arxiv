    "most of analysis in wireless networks consider a 2d analytical model of network .",
    "however since the needs are increasing in terms of qos and performance , and because of the scarcity of the frequency bandwidth , forecast of performance needs to be more and more accurate .",
    "this is the reason why more accurate analytical models are developed and in particular 3d models of wireless networks which should be closer to a real network .",
    "a large literature has been developed about the modeling of wireless networks @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , in the aim to analyze the capacity , throughput , coverage , and more generally performances for different types of wireless systems such as sensors , cellular and ad - hoc ones .",
    "these models of networks are based on i ) stochastic geometry : the transmitters are distributed according to a spatial poisson process , ii ) hexagonal pattern : the transmitting base stations constitute a regular infinite hexagonal grid , iii ) a fluid approach : the interfering transmitters are replaced by a continuum .",
    "the hexagonal wireless network model is the most used one ( @xcite-@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "this model seems rather reasonable for regular deployments of base stations .",
    "however , it is a two dimensional one : it does not take into account the height of antennas , and the propagation in the three dimensions . moreover , from an analytical point of view , it is intractable . therefore , extensive computations are needed to establish performance . among the techniques developed to perform such computations , monte carlo simulations are widely used in conjunction with this model @xcite or numerical computations in hexagonal networks @xcite .",
    "more generally , most of the works focus on 2d models of wireless networks .",
    "nevertheless , 3d models of wireless networks were developed and analyzed in term of capacity @xcite @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite present a 3d geometrical propagation mathematical model . based on this model , a 3d reference model for mimo mobile to mobile fading channels",
    "is proposed . in @xcite , authors propose an exact form of the coverage probability , in two cases : i ) interferers form a 3d poisson point process and ii ) interferers form a 3d modified matern process .",
    "the results established are then compared with a 2d case .",
    "authors of @xcite develop a three - dimensional channel model between radar and cellular base stations , in which the radar uses a two - dimensional antenna array and the base station uses a one - dimensional antenna array .",
    "their approach allows them to evaluate the interference impact .",
    "the 3d wireless model for sensor networks developed in @xcite allows the authors to develop an analysis where the coverage can be improved .",
    "the tilt angle is the corner stone of an algorithm which uses the 3d model they propose ,    : in this paper , we develop a three dimensional analytical model of wireless networks .",
    "we establish a closed form formula of the sinr .",
    "we show that the formula allows analyzing wireless networks with more accuracy than a 2d wireless approach .",
    "comparisons of performance coverage and qos results , established with this 3d spatial fluid model and with a classical 2d model , show the wide interest of using this approach instead of a 2d approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we develop the 3d network model . in section [ 3dfluid ] , the analytical expression of the sinr by using this 3d analytical fluid model",
    "is established . in section [ valid3d ] ,",
    "the validation of this analytical 3d model is done by comparison with monte carlo simulations .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a wireless network consisting of @xmath0 geographical sites , each one composed by 3 base stations .",
    "each antenna covers a sectored cell .",
    "we focus our analysis on the downlink , in the context of an ofdma based wireless network , with frequency reuse 1 .",
    "let us consider :    *  @xmath1 the set of geographic sites , uniformly and regularly distributed over a two - dimensional plane . *  @xmath2 the set of base stations , uniformly and regularly distributed over the two - dimensional plane .",
    "the base stations are equipped with directional antennas : @xmath3= 3 @xmath0 . *",
    "the antenna height , denoted @xmath4 .",
    "* @xmath5 sub - carriers @xmath6 where we denote @xmath7 the bandwidth of each sub - carrier . * @xmath8 the transmitted power assigned by the base station @xmath9 to sub - carrier  @xmath10 towards user @xmath11 . * @xmath12 the propagation gain between transmitter  @xmath9 and user @xmath11 in sub - carrier  @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that time is divided into slots .",
    "each slot consists in a given sequence of ofdma symbols . as usual at network level",
    ", we assume that there is no inter - carrier interference ( ici ) so that there is no intra - cell interference .",
    "the total amount of power received by a ue @xmath11 connected to the base station @xmath13 , on sub - carrier @xmath10 is given by the sum of : a useful signal @xmath14 , an interference power due to the other transmitters @xmath15 and thermal noise power @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the sinr @xmath17 defined by : @xmath18 as the criterion of radio quality .",
    "we investigate the quality of service and performance issues of a network composed of sites equipped with 3d directional transmitting antennas .",
    "the analyzed scenarios consider that all the subcarriers are allocated to ues ( full load scenario ) .",
    "consequently , each sub - carrier @xmath10 of any base station is used and can interfere with the ones of other sites .",
    "all sub - carriers are independent , we can thus focus on a generic one and drop the index @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider the path - gain model @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a constant , @xmath21 is the distance between a transmitter @xmath22 and a receiver @xmath11 , and @xmath23 2 is the path - loss exponent .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the antenna gain ( assuming that receivers have a 0 dbi antenna gain ) .",
    "therefore , for a user @xmath11 located at distance @xmath25 from its serving base station @xmath13 , the expression ( [ sinr ] ) of the sinr can be expressed , for each sub - carrier ( dropping the index @xmath10 ) :    @xmath26    where :    * @xmath27 is the transmitted power , * @xmath28 is the pattern of the 3d transmitting antenna of the base station @xmath13 , and @xmath29 is the maximum antenna gain .",
    "* @xmath30 is the horizontal angle between the ue and the principal direction of the antenna @xmath9 , * @xmath31 is the vertical angle between the ue and the antenna @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ antennes3d-2 ] ) , * @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the projection of @xmath25 on the ground .    the gain @xmath34 of an antenna in a direction @xmath35 is defined as the ratio between the power radiated in that direction and the power that radiates an isotropic antenna without losses .",
    "this property characterizes the ability of an antenna to focus the radiated power in one direction . the parameter @xmath29 ( [ sinrdirect ] ) is particularly important for a beamforming analysis .",
    "let notice that it is determined by considering that the power , which would be transmitted in all directions for a non directive antenna ( with a solid angle of @xmath36 ) , is transmitted in a solid angle given by the horizontal and the vertical apertures of the antenna . in the ideal case where the antenna emits in a cone defined by @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the gain is given by @xmath39 .",
    "in our analysis , we conform to the model of @xcite for the antenna pattern ( gain , side - lobe level ) .",
    "the antenna pattern which is applied to our scheme , is computed as : @xmath40,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond respectively to the horizontal and the vertical antenna patterns .",
    "the horizontal antenna pattern used for each base station is given by : @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where :    * @xmath44 is the half - power beamwidth ( 3 db beamwidth ) ; * @xmath45 is the maximum attenuation .",
    "the vertical antenna direction is given by : @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where :    * @xmath47 is the downtilt angle ; * @xmath48 is the 3 db beamwidth .    .",
    "it receives a useful power from antenna @xmath13 and interference power from antenna @xmath9 . ]",
    "each site is constituted by 3 antennas ( 3 sectors ) .",
    "therefore , for any site @xmath49 of the network , we have : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the angles relative to the antenna @xmath53 for the site @xmath49 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in expression ( [ sinrdirect ] ) we do a sum on the base stations ( not on the sites ) and denote @xmath30 and @xmath31 the angles relative to the antenna  @xmath9 .      for a ue at the distance @xmath54 from the antenna @xmath9",
    ", the vertical angle can be expressed as : @xmath55 for interfering antennas , it can be noticed that since @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . therefore the vertical antenna pattern ( [ eq : v_pattern ] ) can be written as : @xmath59 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & -\\min \\left [ 12 \\left ( \\frac{\\phi_{tilt}}{\\phi_{3db } } \\right)^{2 } , a_m \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & g_{v_{db}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 $ ] ( i.e. a constant ) . and the antenna gain can be expressed as :    @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\min \\left [ -a_{h_{db}}(\\theta ) - g_{v_{db } }   , a_m   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\min \\left [ -a_{h_{db}}(\\theta ) , a_m + g_{v_{db } } \\right ] +   g_{v_{db } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & b_{db}(\\theta)+   g_{v_{db}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "so we have : @xmath63 \\\\",
    "g_{v_{db } } = - \\min\\left[12\\left(\\frac{\\phi_{tilt}}{\\phi_{3db}}\\right)^2,a_m\\right ]          \\end{array }      \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , we establish that in this case , the vertical antenna gain only depends on the angle @xmath64 .",
    "the main assumption of the fluid network modeling @xcite @xcite @xcite consists in replacing a fixed finite number of enbs by an equivalent continuum of enbs spatially distributed in the network .",
    "therefore , the transmitting power of the set of interfering enbs of the network is considered as a continuum field all over the network . considering a density @xmath65 of sites @xmath0 and following the approach developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite ,",
    "let us consider a ue located at @xmath66 in the area covered by the enb @xmath13 .",
    "since each site is equipped by 3 antennas , we can express the denominator of ( [ sinrdirect ] ) as :    @xmath67    where the integral represents the interference due to all the other sites of the network , and the discrete sum represents the interference due to the 2 antennas ( enb ) co - localized with the enb @xmath13 .",
    "the index @xmath68 holds for these 2 antennas .",
    "this can be further written as :    @xmath69    since for the other enb of the network , the distance @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 , and the interference can be approximated by using ( [ eq : hv_pattern2 ] ) : @xmath72      the approach developed in @xcite @xcite allows to express @xmath73 as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 represents the intersite distance ( isd ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite @xcite @xcite for the detailed explanation and validation through monte carlo simulations .",
    "therefore , ( [ interference2 ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath76    for a ue located at @xmath77 ( dropping the index @xmath13 ) , relatively to its serving enb , the inverse of the sinr ( [ sinrdirect ] ) is finally given by the expression : @xmath78 where the index @xmath68 holds for the 2 antennas ( enb ) co - localized with the serving antenna ( enb ) .",
    "the closed form formula ( [ sinrfluid2 ] ) allows the calculation of the sinr in an easy way .",
    "first of all , it only depends on the distance of a ue to its serving enb ( not on the distances to each enb ( sinr expression ( [ sinrdirect])).this formula highlights the network characteristic parameters which have an impact on the sinr ( path loss parameter , inter - site distance , antenna gain ) . a simple numerical calculation is needed , due to the tractability of that formula .",
    "the sinr allows calculating the maximum theoretical achievable throughput @xmath79 of a ue @xmath11 , by using shannon expression . for a bandwidth @xmath7",
    ", it can be written : @xmath80 * remarks : * in the case of realistic wireless network systems , it can be noticed that the mapping between the sinr and the achievable throughput are established by the mean of _ level curves_. +",
    "the validation of the analytical formula ( [ sinrfluid2 ] ) consists in the comparison of the results established by this formula , to the ones established by monte carlo simulations .",
    "let us consider :    * a hexagonal network composed of sectored sites ; * three base stations per site ; * the 2d model : the antenna gain of a transmitting base station is given in db by : @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 = @xmath82 and @xmath83 db ; * the 3d model : the antenna gain of a transmitting base station is given by expressions ( [ eq : hv_pattern ] ) ( [ eq : h_pattern ] ) ( [ eq : v_pattern ] ) ; * analyzed scenarios corresponding to realistic situations in a network : * * urban environment : inter site distance isd = 200 m , 500 m and 750 m , * * antennas tilts : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "user equipments are randomly distributed in a cell of a 2d hexagonal based network ( fig .",
    "[ hexagonaljpg ] ) .",
    "this hexagonal network is equipped by antennas which have a given height ( 30 m and 50 m in our analysis ) , in the third dimension .",
    "monte carlo simulations are done to calculate the sinr for each ue .",
    "we focus our analysis on a typical hexagonal site .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the sinr can be established by using these simulations .",
    "these curves are compared to the ones established by using the analytical formula ( [ sinrfluid2 ] ) to calculate the sinr values . moreover , the sinr values established by the two ways are drawn on figures representing a site with three antennas .",
    "we present two types of comparisons .",
    "we first establish the cdf of the sinr .",
    "indeed , the cdf of sinr provides a lot of information about the network characteristics : the coverage and the outage probability , the performance distribution , and the quality of service that can be reached by the system . as an example ,",
    "figure 3 shows that for an outage probability target of 10% , the sinr reaches -8 db , which corresponds to a given throughput .",
    "a second comparison , focused on the values of the sinr at each location of the cell , establishes a map of sinr over the cell .     and",
    "@xmath87 axes represent the coordinates , in meters .",
    "the intersite distance in this example is 750 m. ]      for the validation , we compare the two methods by considering realistic values of network parameters . an urban environment with realistic parameters of propagation is simulated @xcite .",
    "different tilts and apertures are considered .",
    "the scenarios , summarized in tab .",

    "the aim of our analysis is to propose a model allowing to evaluate the performance , quality of service and coverage reachable in a cell whose standard antennas are replaced by 3d antennas , taking into account the height of the antenna and its tilt .",

    "this implies that the angle @xmath48 has to be lower than @xmath47 , otherwise ues belonging to other cells could be served by this antenna .",
