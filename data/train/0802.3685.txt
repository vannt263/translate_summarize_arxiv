    "both , the bohr - mottelson ( bm ) collective model @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite have thoroughly been used to study the same kind of nuclear structure problems .",
    "although very different in their formulation , both models present clear relationships . in an approximate way",
    ", the ibm can be interpreted as the second quantization of the bm shape variables @xcite .",
    "more detailed connections between both models were studied during the eighties by several authors @xcite and , more recently , by rowe and collaborators @xcite .",
    "both models have three particular cases that can be easily solved and for which a clear correspondence can be done .",
    "these three cases are : i ) the bm anharmonic vibrator and the dynamical symmetry @xmath7 ibm limit , ii ) the bm @xmath5-unstable deformed rotor and the dynamical @xmath8 ibm limit , and iii ) the bm axial rotor and the dynamical symmetry @xmath8 ibm limit including @xmath9 interactions @xcite ) .",
    "note that although it is traditionally accepted the correspondence of the dynamical symmetry @xmath10 ibm limit to a submodel of the bm , this fact has never been explicitly probed @xcite .",
    "each of these cases are assigned to a particular shape using the hill - wheeler variables @xmath11 @xcite : spherical , deformed with @xmath5-instability , and axially deformed , respectively . for transitional situations",
    "the correspondence between the two models is difficult , as rowe said `` what is simple in one model will be complicated when expressed in terms of the observables of the other '' .",
    "this situation suggests , for the case of transitional hamiltonians , to look for the connection between bm and ibm through numerical studies .    among the transitional hamiltonians , a specially interesting case occurs when it describes a critical point in the transition from a given shape to another . in general , for such a situation , where the structure of the system can change abruptly by applying a small perturbation , both",
    ", the bm and the ibm , have to be solved numerically . however , recently iachello has proposed schematic bohr hamiltonians that intend to describe different critical points and that can be solved exactly in terms of the zeros of bessel functions .",
    "the first of these models is known as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is designed to describe the critical point at the transition from spherical to deformed @xmath5-unstable shapes .",
    "the potential to be used in the differential bohr equation is assumed to be @xmath12independent and , for the @xmath13 degree of freedom an infinite square well is taken .",
    "similar models were proposed later on by iachello , called @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite , to describe the critical points between spherical and axially deformed shapes and between axial and triaxial deformed shapes , respectively .",
    "all these models give rise to spectra and electromagnetic transition rates that are parameter free , up to a scale . in spite of their simplicity ,",
    "some experimental examples were found @xcite , just after the appearance of these models .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on @xmath1 and related models .",
    "it will be published elsewhere the corresponding study for @xmath16models @xcite .",
    "the formulation of @xmath1 attracted immediately attention both experimentally and theoretically . soon after the introduction of the @xmath1 model , the nucleus @xmath17ba was proposed by casten and zamfir @xcite as a realization of it .",
    "other experimental examples proposed are : @xmath18ru @xcite , @xmath19pd @xcite and , @xmath20pd @xcite . concerning theoretical extensions of @xmath1 , first , arias @xcite proposed a generalization of the e2 operator to be used with the @xmath1 model , then caprio @xcite checked that a substitution of the original infinite well in the @xmath13 variable by a finite one , which makes the model not exactly solvable anymore , provides similar results .",
    "it showed that the @xmath1 description is `` robust in nature '' , _",
    "i.e. _ the main features of the model remain almost unchanged under strong modification of the depth of the potential .",
    "arias and collaborators @xcite were the first authors who tried to analyze in a quantitative way the connection between the @xmath6 ibm critical point and the @xmath1 model",
    ". in particular , they established , looking to few observables that the ibm , at the critical point , gives results close to @xmath1 for a small ( @xmath21 ) number of bosons . however , the ibm results for large @xmath22 nicely reproduce the spectra and electromagnetic transition rates of a bohr hamiltonian with a @xmath23 potential ( in the following @xmath2 ) . once more , the model is not analytically solvable anymore .",
    "lvai and arias @xcite solved the bohr equation with a sextic potential with a centrifugal barrier @xcite , arriving to almost closed analytical formulae for the energies and wavefunctions . immediately after , bonatsos and collaborators explored the possibility of getting numerical solutions for the @xmath5-independent bohr hamiltonian with potentials of the type @xmath24 , with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "these sequences of potentials allow to go from the vibrational limit , @xmath26 , to @xmath1 , @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite spectra and transition rates for the potentials @xmath28 and , @xmath29 , are given explicitly and compared with the original @xmath1 ( infinite square well potential ) case .",
    "as mentioned above , all these models are produced in the bm scheme and a natural question is to ask for the corresponding equivalence in the ibm .",
    "is the ibm able for producing the same spectra and transition rates ?",
    "if yes , does the ibm hamiltonian correspond to a critical point ?",
    "this work is intended to answer these questions for the @xmath1 and related models ( @xmath30 and , @xmath31 potentials ) and analyze the convergence as a function of the boson number .    for that purpose , a large set of @xmath1 and related models results for excitation energies and transition rates",
    "are taken as reference for numerical fits of the general @xmath6 ibm transitional hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure will allow to establish the ibm hamiltonian which best fit the different @xmath0models and their relation with the critical points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - fit ] the fitting procedure is described and the obtained results are commented . section [ sec - crit ] is devoted to study the energy surfaces of the fitted ibm hamiltonians and to analyze these in relation to the critical point . in section [ sec - quasi ] the connection between the present results and the concept of quasidynamical symmetry",
    "is discussed .",

    "the operator @xmath41 ( where @xmath5 refers to @xmath42 and @xmath34 bosons ) is introduced to ensure the correct tensorial character under spatial rotations .",

    "one of the most attractive features of the @xmath0models treated in this work is that they are supposed to describe , at different approximation levels , the critical point in the transition from spherical to deformed @xmath5-unstable shapes .",
    "since they are connected to a given ibm hamiltonian , as shown in the preceding section , this should correspond to the critical point in the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ibm limits , _",

    "an energy surface can be associated to a given ibm hamiltonian by using the intrinsic state formalism @xcite which introduces the shape variables @xmath11 in the ibm . to define the intrinsic state one has to consider that the dynamical behavior of the system can be approximately described in terms of independent bosons moving in an average field @xcite .",

    "the concept of quasidynamical symmetry ( qds ) was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and has been used in the study of phase transitions .",
    "this concept is very useful for working with hamiltonians that present as limits two dynamical symmetries ( depending on the value of a control parameter ) . in this situation ,",
    "the system shows the tendency to hold onto a given symmetry until the control parameter reach a critical value , passing the system , at this moment , onto the other symmetry .",
    "the remarkable feature is that the system can present a set of states that behave as belonging to irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the corresponding symmetry group , although in fact , they do not belong to a given irrep but to a mixture of them .    in mathematical terms",
    ", a qds can be defined through the _ embedded representations _",
    "@xcite : `` if a subset of states of a system are in one - to - one correspondence with the states of an irrep of a group g and if all the properties of the subset of states associated with observables in the lie algebra of g ( including their relationships to one another but not necessarily their relationships to states outside of the subset ) are as they would be if the states actually belonged to an irrep of the group g , then the subset of states is said to span an embedded representation of g '' . therefore ,",
    "in the case of a qds , there exist a set of states that behave as belonging to a unique irrep of g , although that is only apparent , because they correspond to a superposition of irreps , but all their observables ( up to certain degree of accuracy ) are identical to the ones of states within a given irrep . in summary",
    ", the states can be expressed as a coherent superposition of irreps that behave as a single one .",
    "note that to show that a qds exists , one has to fix a subset of states and the degree of accuracy for the comparison with the observables of the dynamical symmetry .    in our comparison between the ibm and the @xmath0models we observe a phenomenon which resembles the qds , _",
    "i.e. _  part of the ibm spectrum behaves as having @xmath0symmetry , although , indeed they do not have such a symmetry .",
    "we should emphasize that this is not a real qds for two reasons : i ) @xmath0cases are not dynamical symmetry limits of the ibm and ii ) the bm and the ibm have different hilbert spaces .",
    "indeed , it is not possible to define irreps in @xmath0models and therefore embedded representations .",
    "we will call this situation quasi - critical point symmetry ( qcps ) @xcite .    in order to study in detail the qcps one has to fix the degree of accuracy to be demanded to the observables . in our study , for the energies an accuracy of @xmath110 for all the states belonging to a given @xmath69 is set while for the @xmath64 values an accuracy of @xmath111 for all the studied intra - band transitions in a given @xmath69 is selected .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the connection between the @xmath0models and the ibm on the basis of a numerical mapping between models . to establish the mapping we have performed a best fit of the general @xmath6 transitional ibm hamiltonian to a selected set of energy levels produced by several @xmath0models .",
    "later on , a check to the wavefunctions , obtained with the best fit parameters , has been done by calculating relevant @xmath64 transition rates .",

    "we have shown that it is possible , in all cases , to establish a one - to - one mapping between the @xmath0models and the ibm with a remarkable agreement for both the energies and the @xmath64 transition rates .",
    "in general , the goodness of the fit to the energies is independent on the number of bosons , but the corresponding @xmath64 transition rates are indeed sensitive to @xmath22 .",
    "this is so specially in the @xmath1 , for which the @xmath59 value reaches a minimum for @xmath22 small ( @xmath107 ) and from there on increases notably as a function of @xmath22 .",

    "we have confirmed the results of @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the only @xmath0model that can be reproduced exactly by the ibm is @xmath2 , corresponding such a hamiltonian with the critical point of the model ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "a consequence of this excellent agreement is that it is impossible , from a experimental point of view , to discriminate between a @xmath1-model and its corresponding ibm hamiltonian when only few low - lying states are considered ( usually the four lowest states in the ground state band , plus @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the @xmath79 band ) .",
    "we have also proved that all the @xmath0models correspond to ibm hamiltonians very close to the critical area , @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , one can say that the @xmath0 models are appropriate to describe transitional @xmath12unstable regions close to the critical point .",
    "we have found that the results presented in this paper are consistent with the existence of something similar to a quasidynamical symmetry , we call this phenomenon quasi - critical point symmetry .    finally , it should be noted that the use of a more general @xmath6 hamiltonian , _",
