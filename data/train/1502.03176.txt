    "neutron star ( ns ) mergers are strong emitters of gravitational waves ( gws ) and thus among the prime targets for the upcoming gw detectors advanced ligo  @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite .",
    "future gw observations of such events  @xcite could reveal the properties of high - density matter and nss ( see e.g.  @xcite for reviews )",
    ". the merger will likely result in the formation of a differentially rotating , strongly oscillating remnant  .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that detections of its _ dominant _ post - merger gw frequency @xmath0 would strongly constrain the radius and the maximum mass of nonrotating nss  @xcite .",
    "additionally , there exist potentially detectable _ secondary peaks _ at lower frequencies  @xcite , which could improve the constraints on ns properties if the mechanism by which they appear is understood .",
    "in this study we find that _ two different mechanisms _ are at work for producing the low - frequency secondary peaks in the gw spectrum at frequencies below the main peak of the post - merger phase .",
    "specifically , we show that apart from a _ nonlinear combination frequency _ @xcite , there exists also a distinct mechanism that generates a secondary gw peak by the _ rotating pattern of a deformation of spiral shape_. this deformation is initially produced at the time of merging and is then sustained for a few rotational periods .",
    "the consideration of the two different mechanisms leads to a unified classification scheme for the post - merger dynamics and gw emission . for high - mass binaries ( relative to the threshold mass to prompt black - hole collapse ) ,",
    "the nonlinear combination frequency dominates , while for low - mass binaries it is the spiral deformation that produces the strongest secondary peak .",
    "both are simultaneously present and can produce peaks of comparable strength for intermediate binary masses .",
    "hence , the secondary peaks can not simply be explained by the dynamics of the double - core structure alone , which forms the inner part of the remnant , as in  @xcite . identifying the importance of the rotating deformation",
    ", we explain for the first time the existence of a low - frequency modulation appearing in addition to the quasi - radial oscillation mode in several physical quantities characterizing the remnant .    after clarifying the nature of the secondary peaks in the gw spectrum",
    ", we find mass - dependent empirical relations for the different peaks as a function of ns compactness .",
    "we rule out the existence of a universal , mass - independent and eos independent relation for the secondary peaks , a relation recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "such a relation can only be found within a small sample of eoss for a very limited mass range ( not the same for all eoss ) .",
    "our new relations can be used to optimize the constraints on the eos in the case of the simultaneous detection of several post - merger frequencies .",
    "the understanding of the most prominent features of the gw spectrum is a prerequisite for constructing gw templates for the post - merger phase , which could enhance the detection prospects compared to unmodelled searches  @xcite for the advanced ligo and advanced virgo detectors and their discussed upgrades  @xcite .",
    "for the planned einstein telescope  @xcite direct detections of secondary peaks are a viable prospect  @xcite .",
    "we investigate mergers of equal - mass , intrinsically non - spinning nss with a 3d relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code , which imposes the conformal flatness condition on the spatial metric  @xcite to solve einstein s field equations and incorporates energy and angular momentum losses by a gw backreaction scheme   ( see   for details on the code , the setup , resolution tests and model uncertainties ) . comparisons to other numerical setups and also models with an approximate consideration of neutrino effects show an agreement in determining the post - merger spectrum within a few per cent in the peak frequencies  @xcite .",
    "magnetic field effects are negligible for not too high initial field strengths  @xcite .",
    "we explore a representative sample of ten microphysical , fully temperature - dependent equations of state ( eoss ) ( see table  i in  @xcite and fig .  [",

    "we consider only nss with an initially irrotational velocity profile because known spin periods in observed ns binaries are slow compared to their orbital motion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and simulations with initial intrinsic ns spin suggest an impact on the post - merger features of the gw signal only for very fast spins  @xcite .",
    "first , we focus on a reference model for the moderately stiff dd2 eos  @xcite with an intermediate binary mass of @xmath4 . figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the x - polarization of the effective amplitude @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 being the fourier transform of the waveform @xmath7 ) vs. frequency @xmath8 ( reference model in black ) . besides the dominant @xmath9 frequency  .",

    "both are generated in the post - merger phase , which can be seen by choosing a time window covering only the post - merger phase for computing the gw spectrum .",
    "the secondary peak shown as @xmath10 is a nonlinear combination frequency between the dominant quadrupolar @xmath9 oscillation and the quasi - radial oscillation of the remnant , as described in  @xcite .",
    "we confirm this by performing additional simulations , after adding a quasi - radial density perturbation to the remnant at late times .",
    "the frequency @xmath12 of the strongly excited quasi - radial oscillation is determined by a fourier analysis of the time - evolution of the density or central lapse function and coincides with the frequency difference @xmath13 . as in  @xcite , the extracted eigenfunction at @xmath12 confirms the quasi - radial nature .",

    "figure  [ fig : snap ] shows the density evolution in the equatorial plane , in which one can clearly identify the two antipodal bulges of the spiral pattern , which rotate slower than the central parts of the remnant . in this early phase the inner remnant is still composed of two dense cores rotating around each other ( this is the nonlinear generalization of an @xmath14 quadrupole oscillation producing the dominant @xmath15 ) . extracting the rotational motion of the antipodal bulges in our simulations , we indeed find that their frequency equals @xmath16 producing gravitational waves at @xmath17 ( compare the times in the right panels in fig .

    "while in the right panels the antipodal bulges completed approximately one orbit within one millisecond ( @xmath18 ) , the double cores moved further ahead , i.e. with a significantly higher orbital frequency . examining the gw spectrum and considering different time intervals",
    ", we find that the presence of the @xmath11 peak agrees with the appearance and duration of the spiral deformation of the remnant .          in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "2 , the spiral deformation can be seen to initially reach deep inside the remnant .",
    "we approximately determine the amount of matter which belongs to the two antipodal bulges that are rotating slower compared to the double cores .",
    "this matter amounts to several tenths of @xmath3 and is thus sufficient to explain the strength of the @xmath11 gw peak .",
    "in addition , we find that the @xmath11 gw peak can be roughly reproduced in a toy model , where the two bulges orbit as point particles around the central double - core structure for a duration of a few milliseconds .",
    "note that this toy model differs significantly from the one in  @xcite , which considers only the two cores to be contributing to the gw signal and considers only a single instantaneous orbital frequency of the system .",
    "furthermore , we take advantage of the quadrupole formalism to compute gw spectra considering only certain parts of the remnant , which are defined by using either a density or a spatial cut - off . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhospec ] we demonstrate that the dominant quadrupole @xmath15 frequency is generated mainly by those regions of the remnant which encompass densities _ exceeding _ 50% of the instantaneous maximum density @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig : lapse ] ) , of @xmath19 , of the size of the central remnant and of the separation between the two cores .",
    "the same modulation occurs as a beat frequency in the time evolution of the gw amplitude ( see e.g. fig .  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the low - frequency modulation with @xmath21 can coexist with the quasi - radial oscillation , which has a higher frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the above modulation frequency is associated with the rotating bulges and is explained as follows : the central remnant forms an elongated structure , around which the two bulges rotate , lagging behind .",
    "the characteristics of the remnant are modulated depending on the orientation of the antipodal bulges with respect to the double cores : the compactness is smaller , the central lapse function larger and the gw amplitude maximal when the bulges and the cores are aligned ( lower right panel in fig .  [",

    "our simulations also show that the rotational frequency of the centers of the double - core structure , although not constant , significantly exceeds @xmath16 at any time .",
    "hence , variations in the angular frequency of the double - core structure alone are not sufficient to interpret the secondary peaks , and the simultaneous presence of both @xmath28 and @xmath17 can not simply be attributed to a single instantaneous angular frequency of the system , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the simultaneous presence of two ( orbital ) frequencies ( of the double - core structure and of the antipodal bulges ) naturally explains strong time variations of the instantaneous gw frequency as seen in many simulations , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "also , a single , initially strongly varying instantaneous frequency as explanation for the peaks in the spectrum is incompatible with the fact that the most pronounced peak in the spectrum occurs already at early times .",
    "initially , the instantaneous frequency strongly oscillates around the frequency of the dominant peak .",
    "according to the picture of  @xcite , peaks form at frequencies at which the instantaneous frequency spends most time , i.e. at the extrema of the instantaneous frequency .",
    "in this case , one would thus not expect that the dominant @xmath28 is strong at early times .",
    "in contrast , in our simulations the dominant @xmath28 has a substantial strength if one considers only the first few milliseconds .",

    "the results fully confirm the generic picture described above . considering this larger set of models , we identify , based on the relative strength between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , three different types of post - merger dynamics and gw spectra for remnants which survive for more than several milliseconds .    *",
    "_ type i : _ when the total binary mass @xmath29 is not too far from the threshold mass for prompt quasi - radial collapse of the remnant for a given eos  @xcite , the evolution of the central lapse function ( and of @xmath19 ) is dominated by a very strong _ quasi - radial oscillation _ of the remnant , see lower curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : lapse ] . for such models",
    "the two initial nss are more centrally condensed and they merge with higher impact velocity ( fig .  3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "because of the strongly excited quasi - radial oscillation , @xmath10 is the strongest secondary peak in the gw spectrum , while @xmath30 is much weaker , likely because for more compact nss the formation of the spiral pattern is less pronounced .",

    "we also point out that detections of the secondary peaks may possibly be less accurate since the peaks are broader in comparison to the main peak and sometimes do not stand out clearly .    instead of a universal mass - independent relation , we find that there exist useful empirical relations only for fixed binary masses ( shown as thin line segments in figs .",

    "significant improvements in the detectability are possible for more sophisticated search algorithms , e.g. matched filtering , which , however , require detailed modelling of the expected signal features to which our present study should contribute by clarifying the relation between dominant and secondary gw peaks .",
    "depending on the highly uncertain binary ns merger rate , a detection may succeed with advanced ligo / virgo  @xcite or with discussed upgrades  @xcite ( the latter may yield a sensitivity increase at high frequencies of a factor three ) .",
    "since the strength of the secondary features is somewhat lower than that of the dominant peak ( in relation to the anticipated instrument noise curves ) , direct detections of the secondary gw peaks can be expected for the planned einstein telescope  @xcite , unless the merger rate is on the more optimistic side as defined in  @xcite , which may enable an earlier observation .",
    "the exact detection rate of secondary peaks is hard to quantify not only because of the uncertain merger rate , but also because of the varying strength and prominence of the secondary peaks depending on the exact model .    in this study",
    "we focus on equal - mass binaries . to assess the impact of the binary mass ratio , we perform additional simualtions for 1.3 - 1.4  @xmath3 binaries with the dd2 eos  @xcite , ls220 eos  @xcite and nl3 eos  @xcite . the gw spectra in comparison to the symmetric case exhibit qualitatively the same features .",
    "the frequencies of the three different gw peaks are very similar to the equal - mass case with only small deviations of at most 2% , 4% and 6% for @xmath28 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , respectively , compared to the results of the 1.35 - 1.35  @xmath2 binaries .",
    "also the evolution of the central lapse function shows qualitatively the same behavior .",
    "this suggests that at least for moderately asymmetric binaries our classification scheme applies as well .",
    "it also implies that the frequency dependencies and their implications discussed above hold quantitatively with a good accuracy , although the secondary peaks show somewhat larger deviations , which may impede their use for eos constraints if the mass ratio is not measured accurately from the gw inspiral signal .",
    "we present a unified picture of the post - merger dynamics and gw emission in binary ns mergers . aside from the secondary gw peak produced by a nonlinear coupling between quadrupole and quasi - radial oscillations , we identify a new mechanism",
    "by which another secondary peak in the gw spectrum appears : it is caused by a spiral deformation , the pattern of which rotates slower with respect to the double - core structure of the inner remnant .",
    "based on the presence and strength of these two secondary peaks , we introduce a classification scheme of the post - merger dynamics and of the gw spectrum . moreover , the new mechanism allows for an explanation of low - frequency modulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant , such as the central lapse function , the maximum density , the separation between the two cores and the gw amplitude .",
    "we find that for fixed total binary masses the frequencies of the secondary gw peaks show a tight relation with the compactness of nonrotating , individual nss .",
    "these relations follow similar trends as the relation between the dominant peak frequency and the ns compactness ( or , equivalently , the ns radius , as shown in  @xcite ) . for the dominant peak and for the secondary peak associated with the orbital motion of the antipodal bulges we find the relations between frequency and compactness to be similarly tight .",
    "we rule out the existence of a universal , mass - independent relation for secondary peaks as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "identifying the type of a merger event and especially the determination of the quasi - radial frequency by @xmath45 can lead to an estimate of the threshold mass for black - hole collapse and thus to an estimate of the maximum mass of nonrotating nss ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we introduce a classification scheme of the post - merger dynamics and gravitational - wave emission in binary neutron star mergers , after identifying a new mechanism by which a secondary peak in the gravitational - wave spectrum is produced . </S>",
    "<S> it is caused by a spiral deformation , the pattern of which rotates slower with respect to the double - core structure in the center of the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> this secondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak produced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi - radial oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> the new mechanism allows for an explanation of low - frequency modulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant , such as the central lapse function , the maximum density and the separation between the two cores , but also in the gravitational - wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks between their gravitational - wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating individual neutron stars , that exist for fixed total binary masses . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are derived for equal - mass binaries without intrinsic neutron - star spin analyzing hydrodynamical simulations without magnetic field effects . </S>",
    "<S> our classification scheme may form the basis for the construction of detailed gravitational - wave templates of the post - merger phase . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quasi - radial oscillation frequency of the remnant decreases with the total binary mass . for </S>",
    "<S> a given merger event our classification scheme may allow to determine the proximity of the measured total binary mass to the threshold mass for prompt black - hole formation , which can , in turn , yield an estimate of the maximum neutron - star mass . </S>"
