    "in @xcite , @xcite witten defined a class of two dimensional topological theories of gravity coupled with matter , whose distinctive feature is that the correlation functions are equal to an integral over the moduli space with the volume form expressed as the wedge product of certain differential forms associated to the each of the operators . in particular the explicit physical realization of this",
    "is that every operator contains an integer power of a scalar field @xmath1 , the last component of the gravitational multiplet , whose value defines the so called gravitational degree ; in the moduli space integral this corresponds to the power of the two dimensional differential form @xmath2 associated to the scalar @xmath1 .",
    "carefully evaluating the zeros of a section representing one of the @xmath2 s , and if these have support only on the boundary of the moduli space of the riemann surface , allows us to express a correlation function in terms of correlation functions containing a lower total gravitational degree and with genus lower or equal to the original one . the result",
    "are called topological recursion relations .",
    "indeed it is known that the holomorphic limit of the a model correlation functions basically obeys the witten s abstract definition of topological gravity coupled to a two dimensional sigma model , @xcite .",
    "moreover it computes gromov - witten invariants , and these satisfy topological recursion relations .",
    "however a and b topological string models are physically a different story from the theories considered by witten : the target space is fixed to be a calabi yau threefold , in which case the gravitational multiplet scalar @xmath1 simply decouples ( with the only exception of the dilaton ) .",
    "the coupling to two dimensional gravity comes instead from the analogy with the bosonic string theory construction of the gauge fixed path integral , and correlation functions are defined to contain a copy of the left and right moving twisted spin two supercurrents @xmath3 for each of the moduli of the riemann surface @xmath4 . and @xmath5 operator insertions ]",
    "this way of defining topological string amplitudes led the authors of @xcite to the derivation of a different set of recursion relations expressing the antiholomorphic target space moduli derivative of correlation functions in terms of covariant holomorphic derivatives of amplitudes with either a lower genus or a lower number of operator insertions , or both .",
    "these relations are known as the holomorphic anomaly equation ( h.a.e . for short ) .",
    "it is thus a natural question if it exists or not a formalism able to provide a direct connection between the topological recursion relations and the h.a.e . to my knowledge",
    "a similar issue was investigated so far only in @xcite , where the tt * equations were derived from consistency conditions over an enlarged set of operator contact term algebra containing also the antiholomorphic sector , and the h.a.e .",
    "was obtained from the recursion relations written by verlinde and verlinde in @xcite .",
    "their assumptions , development and results are however quite different from the present discussion .",
    "the strategy of the work will be simple .",
    "we want to formally apply the witten s recursion relations machinery to topological string theory correlation functions by roughly looking at @xmath3 as a substitute of the field @xmath1 .",
    "in fact we will see that these objects are , for certain properties , the analogue of what @xmath1 is for the gravitational descendants .",
    "this will lead to the definition of an operator @xmath0 acting on correlation functions and producing what would have been the right hand side of the topological recursion relations if @xmath1 had been replaced by @xmath3 .",
    "the result will be that , imposing a certain commutator between @xmath0 and the flat antiholomorphic derivative @xmath6 ( from the tt * equations of @xcite ) , is equivalent to the h.a.e .",
    "in fact the full algebra we will consider is a generalization of the tt * equations and reads :    @xmath7 = \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}}\\ ] ] @xmath8 = 0\\ ] ] @xmath9 = [ \\nabla_{i},\\nabla_j ] = [ \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}},\\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{j}}]=0\\ ] ]    the first section reviews some background and establishes the notation we will use .",
    "the second and third derive the result for genus zero and one .",
    "the fourth further analyses the algebra between @xmath0 and the flat derivatives and finally the last section considers the generalization at higher genus",
    ". then we present some conclusions .",
    "in @xcite , @xcite two powerful relations were derived involving genus zero and one correlation functions for a wide class of 2 dimensional topological gravitational theories coupled to matter .",
    "these theories are defined by the requirement that the correlation functions in some point in the moduli space are expressed as an integral of a volume form given by the wedge product of certain two dimensional cohomological forms associated to the operators .",
    "these operators are generically represented as @xmath10 and called the degree @xmath11 gravitational descendants of the matter operators @xmath12 belonging to the sigma model topological field theories described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath13    here @xmath14 refers to the moduli space of the riemann surface @xmath4 , and @xmath15 to the instanton moduli space of maps @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the target space . moreover @xmath18 factor appearing in @xcite , @xcite . ] with @xmath19 the first chern class of @xmath20 , the cotangent space to @xmath4 at the position @xmath21 of @xmath22 ; finally being @xmath23 the submanifold of @xmath17 poincare dual to ( the differential form associated to ) the operator @xmath24 , then @xmath25 is defined to be the poincare dual to the submanifold of @xmath15 determined by the condition @xmath26 .    from the above definition and the complex dimension of @xmath14 the selection rule    @xmath27",
    "is derived .    in",
    "this setup witten obtained the following expressions for genus zero and one amplitudes , in the form of recursion relations :    @xmath28    @xmath29    and    @xmath30",
    "@xmath31    here @xmath32 is a metric on the space of operators whose definition given in @xcite and @xcite coincides with the one of @xcite , that we will soon review .",
    "if we write the gravitational multiplet of the two dimensional theory as @xmath33 , the associated ghost number is respectively @xmath34 and the transformation rules under the brst - like topological charge @xmath35 are :    @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38    then the explicit field realization used by witten for @xmath10 , given @xmath39 , is :    @xmath40    from the above equations the topological charge has positive ghost number @xmath41 and @xmath10 has ghost number @xmath42 ; the solutions @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the descent equation appearing in @xmath45 below and in @xmath46 in the next equation is the de rham two dimensional differential , not the integer ]    @xmath47\\ ] ] @xmath48\\ ] ] @xmath49\\ ] ] @xmath50    instead have decreasing ghost number @xmath51 and @xmath52 and explicit form ( for @xmath53 )    @xmath54    the starting point of the present paper is to formally translate the recursion relations derived in the above formalism to amplitudes in topological string theory of `` bcov '' type defined as in @xcite .",
    "the naive justification for this is that , even if basically different in construction , bcov type amplitudes substantially satisfy , in the holomorphic limit , all the important requirement of coupling of two dimensional gravity to topological theories of matter that were used by witten in the derivation of the recursion relations ( look for example at the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this is explicit for the a model computed gromov - witten invariants for which recursion relations are well known .",
    "we begin with genus zero and @xmath5 marginal operator insertions . the riemann surface moduli space integral",
    "is saturated by @xmath55 around the position of certain operators , with @xmath56 conventionally chosen to be the left and right moving spin two supercurrents associated to the spin one antitopological charge .",
    "using a notation analogous to the case with gravitational descendants we define    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    it is important to state that we are not implying that these correlation function are the same as the ones containing operators @xmath60 .",
    "the above notation is simply a convenient choice for the future definition of the operator @xmath0 that will act treating @xmath56 analogously to @xmath1 . in any case from now on we will never use the gravitational multiplet again and we will only deal with bcov type correlation functions . also note that on the left hand side of ( [ c11 ] ) we are incorporating the integrals inside the definition of @xmath61 , while on the right they are explicit .",
    "@xmath62 is also the solution for the last step of the descent equation    @xmath63\\ ] ] @xmath64\\ ] ] @xmath65\\ ] ] @xmath66    if @xmath39 has equal left and right u(1 ) charge @xmath67 , then @xmath62 has left - right charge @xmath68 .    amplitudes at genus @xmath69 are defined saturating the remaining part of the riemann surface moduli space integral by the measure @xmath70 , with @xmath71 the beltrami differentials :    @xmath72    the definition at genus 1 is slightly different and we will deal with it in section [ sez1 ] .",
    "being @xmath11 the total number of @xmath73 insertions ( both around the operators and in the path integral measure ) the selection rule for the left ( and right ) u(1 ) r - symmetry charges @xmath74 for the operator insertions dictated by the u(1 ) anomaly on a calabi yau manifold is    @xmath75    this makes an obvious parallel between ( [ c1 ] ) and the above formula ; when the operators are marginal ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 in ( [ c1 ] ) , the total gravitational degree @xmath11 equals the number of degree one gravitational descendant operators and matches the above total number of @xmath73 insertions , again @xmath11 .",
    "moreover when the genus is either zero or one all the @xmath73 insertions come from the operators , as is the case with gravitational descendants .",
    "and it is also true that both @xmath1 and @xmath73 serve as an integral over @xmath14 .",
    "the analogy between the two cases in fact can not be pushed further , their ghost number and behaviour under the action of @xmath35 being opposite . but this will not affect our purposes .    it is still possible for bcov type amplitudes on calabi yau to contain gravitational descendants like ( [ b1 ] ) but being their total ghost number @xmath78 and having the selection rule ( [ c31 ] ) , they can appear on genus @xmath79 amplitudes only when @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , the so called dilaton operator ( the case @xmath83 allows a little more ) .",
    "we will not consider them in the future .",
    "* remark * : the main difference between topological amplitudes of witten and bcov type is that in the first case the gravitational multiplet is distinct from the matter multiplets , while in the second case the supercurrents @xmath56 are constructed with the same fields entering the matter operators .",
    "consequently the requirement for forming a volume form for the moduli space integral out of gravitational multiplet fields ( [ c1 ] ) and any eventual u(1 ) charge anomaly for the matter fields , merge in the bcov case into the unique condition ( [ c31 ] ) .    from now on",
    "we differentiate the notation for the indexes of the operators depending on the u(1 ) charge associated . we will indicate a generic matter operator with greek indexes @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( marginal ) operators with mid alphabet latin indexes @xmath86 , @xmath87 operators with beginning of the alphabet latin letters @xmath88 and the single @xmath89 and @xmath90 operators respectively with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "amplitudes involving marginal operators can be obtained by appropriate derivatives    @xmath93    with @xmath94 called the prepotential .",
    "two metrics can be introduced on the moduli space , both covariantly constant under the action of @xmath95 and @xmath96 :    @xmath97    @xmath98    the last equation in particular fixes the connections to be    @xmath99    and the mixed indexes components vanishing . under complex conjugation @xmath79",
    "goes to itself , @xmath100 , while @xmath101 transforms into the corresponding metric for the antitoplogical moduli space , @xmath102 .",
    "we introduce the tt * equations of @xcite .",
    "these are equivalent to the existence of a flat connection given by the sum of the usual metric connection with the chiral ring matrix @xmath103 ( the three point function with one index raised ) and its complex conjugate @xmath104 :    @xmath105    @xmath9 = [ \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}},\\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{j } } ] = [ \\nabla_{i},\\nabla_{j } ] = 0\\ ] ]    with @xmath106 a generic coefficient which will be fixed from now on to the value @xmath107 .",
    "moreover there exist a matrix @xmath108 defined as    @xmath109    which is by construction invariant under parallel transport by @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and also by the flat derivatives @xmath112 and @xmath6 because    @xmath113    and similarly for the action of @xmath104 .",
    "it can be normalized as    @xmath114    the worldsheet construction of @xmath32 is simply the sphere with two fixed operator insertions @xmath39 and @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "in fact due to the irrelevance of the positions and the trivial ope of the identity with any other operator , @xmath101 can be seen as the three point sphere amplitude @xmath117 with one operator being the identity :    @xmath118    the metric @xmath119 is instead more complicated and it can be represented as two hemispheres , one topologically and the other antitopologically twisted , joined by an infinitely long tube interpolating between the two topological cfts . on each hemisphere there is one operator insertion , @xmath39 and @xmath120 respectively , with the charge condition being @xmath121 .",
    "we begin by consider a bcov type amplitude as in ( [ c11 ] )    @xmath122    with the last three positions fixed . for convenience we will use @xmath123 and @xmath124 to play the role of @xmath125 and @xmath126 inside ( [ a ] ) ,",
    "while the operator corresponding to @xmath127 will be @xmath128 . while applying ( [ a ] ) we keep fixed or integrated the positions of the operators as they were originally in the above amplitude .",
    "the only exception is @xmath128 that , after the transformation @xmath129 , will pass from being integrated to being kept fixed , as one would expect after having performed the moduli space integration over its cohomology class that has led to the recursion relation itself .",
    "we then define the action of the operator @xmath130 on these genus zero amplitudes , that later on will be transformed into @xmath0 , its `` symmetrized '' version .",
    "the goal is to formally reproduce the right hand side of the recursion relation ( [ a ] ) when acting on bcov type amplitudes , where the scalar @xmath1 will be replaced by the two supercurrents @xmath73 .",
    "so in particular when moving from left to right in the expression below the transformation @xmath129 will mean that @xmath131 , instead of the original @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath133    @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136    we want to explain the various terms .",
    "the first two lines are the direct translation of the right hand side of ( [ a ] ) with the fixed position operator @xmath137 first on one side and then on the other , as we kept it outside the sets @xmath138 and @xmath139 for later convenience .",
    "the operators @xmath39 and @xmath115 have their positions naturally fixed if the number of operators whose position is fixed in the same amplitude is less or equal to two . otherwise they are integrated , and in this case the notation becomes @xmath140",
    ".    the second line in fact immediately simplifies because    @xmath141    where we have used first the u(1 ) charge condition ( [ c31 ] ) fixing @xmath142 , and then the fact that @xmath101 is covariantly constant .",
    "thus contributions come only when @xmath143 and @xmath139 the whole set @xmath144 .",
    "the last term is due to a subtle but important point we have to consider when we apply the machine leading to ( [ a ] ) to amplitudes of bcov type .",
    "in particular the passage from the left to the right hand side of ( [ a ] ) is achieved through the appearance of a node as we degenerate the genus zero correlation function into two spheres sharing a single point . when we represent operators with gravitational degree one as ( [ c111 ] ) , it is possible for the node to arise in between the position of one of the operators and the two circle integrals of the supercurrents @xmath145 ;",
    "more specifically if we think of the node as appearing after the shrinking to a point of a nontrivial cycle on the riemann surface , this cycle can be taken as well in an intermediate worldsheet time between the one of the operator and its two accompanying supercurrents .",
    "furthermore it is possible to include inside the region bounded by the shrinking cycle other operators as well , as long as they are closed under the action of @xmath145 .",
    "this construction is represented in figure ( [ figura1 ] ) .",
    "the net result is that the two supercurrents @xmath145 originally encircling around one operator , for example @xmath146 , after the recursion relation has been applied will surround the position of the node on the opposite sphere .",
    "thus the gravitational coupling shifts from @xmath147 to the operator @xmath148 replacing the node on that side , and transforming it to @xmath149 . note that the integrated position of the operator @xmath147 on the original amplitude becomes fixed on the factorized sphere , because the integration passes from the position of @xmath147 to the position of the node as should be clear from the picture .    having defined the action of @xmath130 let us step aside for a moment and discuss a point we have so far avoided .",
    "it is well known that bcov type amplitudes possess a nontrivial dependence on antiholomorphic moduli , while it is their holomorphic limit that resembles the witten s definition for two dimensional topological gravity + matter theories leading to the recursion relations .",
    "thus we need to supplement equation ( [ ccc ] ) with the correct antiholomorphic moduli dependence .",
    "in fact this is a necessity as the right hand side of ( [ ccc ] ) identically vanishes if we apply the u(1 ) charge condition ( [ c31 ] ) .",
    "for this reason let us consider the following algebra :    @xmath150 = \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}}\\ ] ]    @xmath151 = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath152 = [ \\nabla_{i},\\nabla_j ] = [ \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}},\\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{j}}]=0\\ ] ]    the main point of the paper will be to show that the first commutator is equivalent to the h.a.e . .",
    "the second commutator will be discussed later on and we have already met the last .",
    "so we want to evaluate ( [ cr1 ] ) when acting on genus zero amplitudes with @xmath5 marginal operator insertions .",
    "the right hand side is easy .",
    "we recall the definition @xmath153 and , because the correlation function contains only holomorphic indexes , @xmath154 vanishes , as it would be a mixed component .",
    "moreover @xmath104 acting on low indexes transforms charge @xmath155 into charge @xmath156 operators , thus killing any amplitude previously satisfying the u(1 ) charge selection rule .",
    "thus what survives is only the antiholomorphic simple derivative @xmath157 .",
    "the left hand side is more tricky : @xmath158 is well defined , as it is simply the action of @xmath6 on the right hand side of ( [ ccc ] ) ; instead we should explain what we mean for @xmath159 .",
    "we have defined the action of @xmath130 on amplitudes with topological marginal operators , now we associate to @xmath6 an operator insertion @xmath160 and we extend the definition in the natural way .",
    "@xmath160 is a short distance refinement of the operator associated to @xmath111 , which is the integral of @xmath161 .",
    "the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath111 is the action of @xmath162 on the indexes of the operators inside the amplitude , that is @xmath163 the coefficient of the ope of the operators with @xmath164 .",
    "to which the amplitude belongs , but for antiholomorphic derivatives and topological amplitudes it vanishes . ] in particular if the index belongs to an operator @xmath165 the ope should be taken under the action of the two spin two supercurrents @xmath166 and @xmath167 that is acts on low indexes in accordance with the usual convention for a connection ]    @xmath168    with @xmath169 . thus @xmath160 is defined as the sum of the operator insertion corresponding to @xmath111 plus the insertion of @xmath170 inside an infinitesimal neighborhood @xmath171 around the position of each preexisting operator , reproducing the opes of @xmath162 .",
    "moreover we include the short distance regularization prescription for @xmath161 when approaching other operators , see @xcite , that can be translated as excluding from its region of integration a small neighborhood around each operator :    @xmath172    the action of @xmath130 on the amplitude containing @xmath160 is the natural generalization of ( [ ccc ] ) , with @xmath160 treated similarly to the other operators but conveniently kept outside the sets @xmath138 and @xmath139 and thus appearing first on one side and then on the other .",
    "@xmath173    @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179    written in this way",
    "the definition is apparently inconsistent because of the third term on the right hand side .",
    "this has been generated through the mechanism discussed previously , when the riemann surface node makes its appearance between one operator @xmath180 and its two accompanying supercurrents .",
    "however the requirement was that , after the riemann surface degeneration has been applied , all the operators present on the same sphere containing @xmath180 have to be closed under the action of @xmath145 . and",
    "this fails for @xmath161 in the definition ( [ tra ] ) of @xmath160 .",
    "this object should also disappear from the fifth term as a consequence of @xmath181 .",
    "however there is a more fundamental overall reason why the first term in ( [ tra ] ) can not appear anywhere in the above expression , and it is again the u(1 ) charge selection rule .",
    "for example the first term requires @xmath182 for the first sphere , @xmath183 for the metric and @xmath184 for the second sphere , with @xmath185 either zero or @xmath186 depending on which term inside @xmath187 you are considering .",
    "obviously the three conditions are satisfied together only when @xmath188 ; this can be straightforwardly derived for every term .",
    "thus the result is that the only non vanishing contributions select the @xmath170 piece from @xmath160 .",
    "it is here crucial the interpretation of the action of @xmath6 as the operator insertion of @xmath187 .",
    "once @xmath130 has been applied the insertion of @xmath39 or @xmath115 are defined to be consistent with the definition ( [ tra ] ) , and this in particular means that the ope with @xmath170 ( represented by the second term in ( [ tra ] ) ) includes also the action on @xmath39 or @xmath115 , together with every other operator in the amplitude",
    ".    understood this point we can finally go back from the @xmath187 - operatorial description to the to @xmath6 - covariant derivative formalism , and this translates into the selection of the @xmath162 term inside @xmath6 acting on every index inside the two factorized amplitudes , with @xmath111 decoupling .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath189 is easier .",
    "this object consists of the insertion of the integral of @xmath190 inside all the amplitudes and the metric , plus the action of @xmath162 on every low and high index .",
    "again the u(1 ) charge condition selects only the latter .",
    "the difference between @xmath191 and @xmath189 then reduces to minus the action of @xmath162 on the metric @xmath192 . taking care of the correct",
    "@xmath193 and @xmath194 charges it gives    @xmath195    @xmath196 @xmath197 @xmath198    obviously @xmath199 .",
    "moreover , remembering the worldsheet definition of @xmath101 , @xmath200 , and the normalization ( [ norm ] ) , @xmath201 , we have    @xmath202 @xmath203    finally let consider the amplitude containing @xmath204 ( in this case @xmath205 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath206 has been previously identified with the identity 1 but this is not really valid globally on the riemann surface .",
    "the correct prescription is @xmath207 with @xmath208 the riemann surface curvature .",
    "the rationale behind this identification is that in a topologically twisted theory of bcov type the action is modified with the addition of a term implementing the topological twist :    @xmath209    with @xmath210 the scalar bosonizing the u(1 ) r - symmetry current . due to conformal invariance @xmath208",
    "can be represented as a sum of @xmath211 delta functions on a surface of genus @xmath79 with @xmath5 operator insertions , each delta function carrying @xmath212 units of curvature .",
    "thus the above integral reduces to an insertion of @xmath213 at each of these @xmath211 points . on the other side",
    "it is known that there exists a contact term between the operator @xmath206 and any other marginal operator @xmath214 : this was computed in @xcite to be @xmath215 , @xmath216 the moduli space kahler potential , and explained as arising from an hidden contact term between these operator insertions @xmath214 and @xmath217 inside the action , that we have seen corresponding @xmath211 insertions of @xmath213 .",
    "thus @xmath206 is defined in such a way as to reduce locally to the identity , but on the points where @xmath213 is inserted in which case the short distance divergent coefficient with @xmath214 has to be @xmath214 itself at that point , thus producing the ope with @xmath213 as the final result . and this leads exactly to @xmath207 .    if the operator @xmath206 is at fixed position we can choose the delta function supports to be away and simply write @xmath218 .",
    "but if the operator is integrated the two dimensional integral selects the two form component of @xmath207 and we have @xmath219 .",
    "this is indeed reminiscent of the dilaton equation appearing in @xcite , identifying the dilaton @xmath220 with @xmath221 .",
    "indeed we would expect that @xmath1 translates to the circle integral of the two spin two supercurrents , as for the other operators .",
    "however it is clear that such result is zero as the ope of the identity with @xmath222 and @xmath223 is trivial .",
    "the next possibility is the integral of the identity without the two supercurrents , giving @xmath224 . in our case",
    "this allows us to get rid of @xmath224 substituting it with the factor @xmath225 .",
    "collecting all the terms we arrive at the result    @xmath226\\langle { \\cal{o}}_{1,i_{1}}\\dots{\\cal{o}}_{1,i_{n-3}}{\\cal{o}}_{i_{n-2}}{\\cal{o}}_{i_{n-1}}{\\cal{o}}_{i_{n}}\\rangle_{0 } = \\ ] ]    @xmath227 @xmath228 @xmath229    this looks already similar to the right hand side of the h.a.e . at genus zero of @xcite but with an important difference in structure : here the operator @xmath230 and the couple @xmath231 are singled out from the very beginning and do not enter the summation spreading the remaining operators on the two degenerate spheres . instead the corresponding h.a.e .",
    "treats all the operators in an equivalent way and neither @xmath230 nor @xmath123 and @xmath124 are fixed by construction to be on separate amplitudes . to cure this problem",
    "we need to implement the `` symmetrization '' of @xmath130 into @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetrized recursion relations corresponding to the action of @xmath0 is defined by first summing over all the choices of the three selected operators indicated from now on as @xmath232 ( formerly @xmath230 ) , and the couple @xmath233 ( before @xmath231 ) , and after the recursion relations have been applied dividing by the number of possible choices inside the two factorized amplitudes .",
    "moreover we always select the three operators at fixed positions in the starting amplitude to contain the couple @xmath233 plus a third random operator @xmath234 ( where the only requirement for @xmath155 is to not coincide with any of the indexes @xmath235 ) .",
    "obviously @xmath232 has gravitational degree @xmath236 , otherwise it would be impossible to apply @xmath130 as we have defined it .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first : summing over all the choices involves @xmath237 summands to the sum ( as the distinction between @xmath233 is irrelevant ) , but dividing after having applied the recursion relations only reduces the number by @xmath238 , where @xmath91 is the number of possible choices of @xmath239 inside the first factorised amplitude , when @xmath240 of elements in @xmath241 = x-2 $ ] .",
    "the choices of the set @xmath242 inside the other amplitude give instead @xmath243 , and the additional factor of two is from the possibility of interchanging the two amplitudes containing respectively the couple of operators @xmath233 and @xmath232 ( and accordingly moving two supercurrents from one side to the other for fulfilling the u(1 ) charge selection rules as depicted in figure ( [ figura1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus this procedure really increases the number of terms in the recursion relation .",
    "second : formally which three operators you pick up in computing the recursion relation is irrelevant ; even if every choice produces results that look different , they are really the same by construction .",
    "thus , together with the rescaling by @xmath244 , the whole procedure amounts only to an overall different normalization factors in front of the right hand side of ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this will drastically change for genus higher than 2 .",
    "however keeping explicit different choices for the three operators in all the terms gives at the end a result which is manifestly symmetric in all the operators inside the amplitude .",

    "the final expression of the commutator ( [ cr1 ] ) applied to @xmath254 is :    @xmath255c_{i_1\\dots i_n}= \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{c}_{\\bar{i}}^{lm}\\hspace{-0.3 cm}\\sum_{x\\cup y=\\{1,n\\}}c_{\\prod_{r\\in x}i_rm}c_{\\prod_{s\\in y}i_sl } - ( n-3)\\sum_{p=1}^n g_{p\\bar{i}}c_{i_1\\dots\\hat{p}\\dots i_n}\\ ] ]    which is the h.a.e .",
    "of @xcite at genus zero .",
    "we move now to genus one .",
    "we begin by rescaling the amplitude as @xmath256 ( where @xmath257 is the correlation function entering ( [ b ] ) ) , and we are led to the definition :    @xmath258    @xmath259    for simplicity of notation from now on we will drop the label `` @xmath260 '' . the first term is the direct translation of the first term in ( [ b ] ) with the new normalization , while the second and third ones correspond to the second term of ( [ b ] ) after using the fact that the metric is covariantly constant and having again applied the mechanism depicted in figure ( [ figura1 ] ) . let us evaluate the commutator @xmath261 $ ] . proceeding exactly as in the genus zero case , the u(1 )",

    "@xmath263 @xmath264 @xmath265    @xmath206 can be made disappear from the second line after taking its trivial ope with any other operator and , being @xmath101 covariantly constant , the second term of the above expression contributes only when the number of operators @xmath5 is 1 . in this case",
    "it has the value    @xmath266    from the other terms instead we obtain    @xmath267 @xmath268    as before    @xmath269    again we symmetrize @xmath130 by summing over all the operators to take the role of @xmath270 and , after the recursion relation has been applied , dividing by the possible choices .",
    "the result gives the equivalence of the commutator ( [ cr1 ] ) applied to @xmath271 and the h.a.e . at genus one with @xmath272 marginal operator insertions :    @xmath273c_{i_1\\dots i_n}^1 = \\ ] ]    @xmath274    the case @xmath275 requires more care .",
    "in this situation ( [ l ] ) reduces to    @xmath276    remembering the additional contribution from ( [ xxx ] ) the usual commutator gives the result    @xmath277\\langle { \\cal{o}}_{1,i}\\rangle_1=\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{c}_{\\bar{i}}^{lm}c_{ilm}+g_{\\bar{i}i}\\left ( 1 + \\langle { \\cal{o}}_{0}^{\\int}\\rangle_{1 } \\right)\\ ] ]    on a torus without operator insertions the integral of the curvature is zero , thus the topological twist is trivial and the identification @xmath278 is correct also globally .",
    "then the operator insertion @xmath279 simply multiplies @xmath280 by the area of the torus , where the latter is the empty genus one amplitude . in @xcite and @xcite of difference between the two definitions ]",
    "the operator formulation is used to define @xmath281 as follows :    @xmath282\\ ] ]    where @xmath283 are the left and right fermion number currents .",
    "the problem is that this expression is singular for @xmath284 and @xmath285 , and even worse when multiplied by the area of the torus @xmath286 ; thus it needs regularization and it is uniquely defined only up the addition of a constant ( that drops out only when there is at least one operator ) .",
    "so the question of what is the value of @xmath287 is ill posed , nonetheless there are two natural ways to fix the constant .",
    "the first obvious one is to compare ( [ n4 ] ) to the h.a.e . for @xmath288 , and obtain    @xmath289    the second method just generalizes the observation done in the previous section that the operator @xmath290 behaves as minus the dilaton @xmath291 .",
    "thus we can consider the dilaton equation for the present case , @xcite , to get @xmath292 ; the missing @xmath293 can be understood from the loop propagation of the topological matter states .",
    "it is interesting to check explicitly the vanishing of the commutators = [ \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}},\\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{j}}]=0 $ ] but these are not of direct interest to us ]    @xmath294 = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath8 = 0\\ ] ]    the second equation is a direct consequence of the u(1 ) charge condition on the amplitudes : either from ( [ ccc ] ) or ( [ l ] ) it is immediate to see that neither the action of @xmath110 nor of @xmath295 permits the appearance of non zero terms .",
    "thus the commutator is satisfied in the trivial way , both @xmath296 and @xmath297 being zero .",
    "in fact an important difference between the witten s formulation of the recursion relations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) and the present realization of @xmath130 , is what does it happen when you act on the recursion relations with an holomorphic derivative that corresponds to the insertion of one more operator , let us say @xmath298 . in @xcite , @xcite it was shown how the action of an holomorphic derivative would transform the recursion relations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) into the corresponding expression for an amplitude containing also @xmath298 .",
    "this in particular would allow the recursion relations to be valid everywhere in the moduli space of the theory , provided that they are valid in one point and that infinitesimal shifts in the moduli space positions are equivalent to deformations of the action by the same operators associated to the covariant derivative . in our language",
    "all this translates to the vanishing of the commutator @xmath299 = 0 $ ] . leaving aside for the moment the u(1 ) charge condition that would make both terms of the commutator vanish identically",
    ", we can see how the action of @xmath300 on the recursion relation generated by @xmath130 is different by the recursion relation for an amplitude with one additional operator insertion .",
    "for example at genus one we have    @xmath301    @xmath302 @xmath303    @xmath304 @xmath305 @xmath306    this fails to reproduce the recursion relation for a genus one amplitude with @xmath307 operator insertions , @xmath308 , as it misses the term    @xmath309    which would come as the special case @xmath310 from the last term in equation ( [ l ] ) , and can not be obtained by the action of @xmath300 on any term inside @xmath311 .",
    "however this is somehow irrelevant as the right hand side of both ( [ ccc ] ) and ( [ l ] ) is always zero due to the u(1 ) charge condition , and @xmath300 does not change the charge",
    ". a better question would come from considering not @xmath299 $ ] but instead @xmath312 , d_{i_{n+1 } } ] $ ] , that is switching from the action of @xmath0 alone to the commutator @xmath313 $ ] , which applied to the amplitudes produces a nonzero result , and evaluating its commutator with @xmath300 . having @xmath261 = \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}}$ ] we are naturally brought to the direct analysis of @xmath314 $ ] , or equivalently of @xmath315 $ ] ( known the latter we can compute the former ) .",
    "this can be generically applied to amplitudes @xmath316 .",
    "its zero result is a well known direct consequence of the tt * equations , but it can be rederived as well from the explicit form of the h.a.e . after it is rewritten as is a section of @xmath317 , the indexes @xmath318 belonging to the latter while @xmath319 can be formally represented by the identity operator @xmath92 on which both @xmath320 and @xmath104 should be made acting ( even if the second is in fact vanishing again due to the u(1 ) anomaly condition ) . ]    @xmath321c^{g}_{i_1\\dots i_n } = -[c_{i_{n+1}},\\bar{c}_{\\bar{i}}]c^{g}_{i_1\\dots",
    "i_n}\\ ] ]    the fact that the h.a.e . for amplitudes with operator insertions is the direct consequence of the h.a.e . for amplitudes without operators and the first commutator in ( [ fc ] ) , was already well known since @xcite .",
    "here we are proposing an enlarged algebra based on the definition of the operator @xmath0 whose consequence , without further input , is the h.a.e . for generic amplitudes with operators .",
    "moreover , and this is the central point , this algebra makes direct contact with the witten derivation of the topological recursion relations .",
    "we want to generalize this construction at higher genus . because the derivation used by witten does not straightforwardly extend for generic genus @xmath79 ( though recursion relations for gromov - witten invariants have been written at higher genus , @xcite and @xcite ) , we reverse the procedure used so far . first we define @xmath130 in order to reproduce the form of the h.a.e . ,",
    "and then we attempt an algebraic interpretation to make contact with the witten s derivation of the topological recursion relations .",
    "following this philosophy we divide @xmath130 in two parts and define @xmath322 as    @xmath323    @xmath324    @xmath325    @xmath326    the two operators @xmath327 and @xmath328 correspond pictorially to the contributions represented in figure ( [ figura2 ] ) ; note the novelty of the terms dividing the surface into a genus @xmath329 and @xmath330 pair , when a dividing cycle shrinks forming a dividing node .    from equation ( [ r ] ) we are again led to interpret @xmath327 as the evaluation of the zeros of a section associated to the cohomology class of @xmath230 , as it transforms to @xmath331 .",
    "so the first question is why also @xmath328 appears ? and",
    "the second is what is the physical object inside the correlation function associated to the two form we presume has been integrated over to pass to the right hand side of ( [ r2 ] ) ?",
    "both answers come from the generalization of the procedure of symmetrization we have used to pass from @xmath130 to @xmath0 .",
    "the reason we should include also @xmath328 in the game is that for genus @xmath69 amplitudes the spin two supercurrents @xmath73 appear not only inside the operator insertions but also in the topological measure @xmath332 , which is an essential ingredient in the definition ( [ c1tt ] ) .",
    "thus the process of symmetrization enlarges from summing other all the operators to summing other everything that contains @xmath73 ; when @xmath73 belong to the operators we are led to @xmath327 , when they belong to the measure we are led to @xmath328 .",
    "more precisely we identify the topological measure as the physical object associated to the two dimensional differential form we are supposed to integrate in order to reproduce the right hand side of ( [ r2 ] ) . in order to predict the form of @xmath328 we would need to find an appropriate section with zeros supported only at the boundary of @xmath14 , and",
    "then integrate .",
    "but it is probably too complicated .",
    "however an indirect result can be inferred , as we have done , starting from the h.a.e . and giving the form of @xmath328 which is compatible with it .",
    "in fact we can check that , passing from left to right in equation ( [ r2 ] ) , the total topological measure always looses three of the terms @xmath333 , two of which come back as the measure associated to the moduli parametrizing the position of the node and thus encircling the operators @xmath39 and @xmath115 , as well known from the construction in @xcite .    accepted the result the evaluation of the commutator @xmath313 = \\bar{\\nabla}_{\\bar{i}}$ ] proceeds analogously as before , symmetrizing @xmath327 ( @xmath328 is already defined as symmetrized over all the @xmath334 contributions from @xmath333 ) , and it produces the most general form of the h.a.e .",
    ", for correlation functions at genus @xmath69 and @xmath5 marginal operators .",
    "in this work we have established a connection between the topological recursion relations and the h.a.e . .",
    "in detail we have first defined an operator @xmath0 mimicking the symmetrization of what would be the action of the topological recursion relations on bcov type amplitudes , formally replacing the role of the scalar @xmath1 with @xmath73 .",
    "then we have written an algebra containing @xmath0 , @xmath335 and @xmath6 that introduces the antiholomorphic information contained into the topological string amplitudes ( expected to satisfy the recursion relations only in the holomorphic limit ) and generalizes the tt * equations . its validity is confirmed by being equivalent to the h.a.e . when applied to topological string amplitudes with marginal operator insertions .",
    "thus the connection between the formalism developed by witten and the h.a.e . of bershadsky , cecotti , ooguri and vafa .    a first direction for future work is certainly a deeper understanding of the above construction and a natural guess is the possibility of a purely geometrically algebraic derivation of the h.a.e .",
    "further it follows the question if it exists some deeper understanding for the construction of the operator @xmath0 ( counterpart of the possible geometrically algebraic derivation in the holomorphic limit ) and of the algebra ( [ cr1 ] ) , ( [ cr2 ] ) and ( [ cr3 ] ) ( that would correspond to the antiholomorphic information ) .",
    "indeed all of this can be of conceptual interest as the h.a.e .",
    "is already well known to have deep and interesting physical interpretations beyond the usual worldsheet construction ( see for example @xcite ) .    as a more specific subproblem",
    "it would also be interesting to understand the process of symmetrization of the operator @xmath0 that has not a clear meaning from an algebraic point of view .",
    "for amplitudes at genus zero and one it looks only as an overall normalization in front of the recursion relations , but for higher genus it is the base for the construction of @xmath327 and @xmath328 , as we have seen .    besides the result per se",
    "we would also like to look for some practical applications .",
    "a first idea would be to consider our algebraic construction as an initial step into proving the integrability for generic topological string amplitudes , extending the result already achieved for solutions of the tt * equations .",
    "this is certainly worth of future work .",
    "moreover it is plausible that the present construction can be an important tool for developing new techniques for solving the h.a.e . in a",
    "perhaps more efficient way .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank giulio bonelli , tohru eguchi , kazuhiro sakai , tadashi takayanagi and alessandro tanzini for various discussions and useful comments .",
