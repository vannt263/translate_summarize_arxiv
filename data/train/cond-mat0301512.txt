    "the question of the origin and nature of shear localization in disordered systems , such as soft glasses or confined granular media , which are jammed at equilibrium , but flow when sheared beyond a threshold stress , is a long standing one . due in particular to recent progress in theoretical descriptions , it is presently the subject of renewed interest . hence the need for identifying appropriate , non invasive methods of experimental investigation which could complement the optical and nmr imaging ones , recently put to use by pignon et al @xcite , and by coussot et al @xcite .",
    "we intend to show in this article that the propagation of sound pulses appears as a promising possibility .",
    "namely , we will show that the presence of a shear band of thickness small compared with the acoustic wavelength should give rise to strong anomalous reflection of a transverse acoustic signal for well defined incidence ranges .",
    "such a method could therefore provide a relatively handy fingerprint of shear localization in confined granular media .",
    "an extreme case of localized shear flow is that of frictional sliding of the interface between two cohesive macroscopic solids .",
    "in such a configuration , the very structure of the system prelocalizes shear to the nanometer - thick layer which forms the molecular adhesive contact(s ) .",
    "the role of the above - mentioned threshold stress is played here by the so - called static friction force . below this threshold ,",
    "the interface is elastically pinned ( jammed ) , and responds elastically to a shearing force .",
    "so , the corresponding mechanical boundary condition is simply that the displacement fields in the two media must be fully continuous across the interface .",
    "but , beyond this shear level , sliding sets in and , along the direction of relative motion , the boundary condition is now provided by the dynamic friction law , which states that the shear and normal stresses are proportional .",
    "obviously , such a discontinuity of the boundary conditions must result in a discontinuous change of the acoustic reflection and transmission coefficients when the system is set into sliding .",
    "this was pointed out already long ago by chez et al @xcite , who studied the reflection of a sound wave propagating in a plane orthogonal to the sliding direction , and polarized in the plane of incidence on an interface with the coulomb frictional behavior ( constant friction coefficient ) . however , due to the choice of this particular geometry , they overlooked an interesting effect .",
    "indeed , the sliding system is an open one : energy is being pumped in from an external source  the external driving machine which imposes the sliding velocity .",
    "so , as soon as the acoustic displacement field has a non - zero component , in the interfacial plane , along the direction of the sliding motion , additional mechanical work ( of a priori either sign ) is extracted from the external source , and interfacial acoustic scattering is no longer energy - conserving .",
    "this opens in principle the possibility of acoustic gain at reflection , i.e. conversion of incoherent into coherent mechanical energy ",
    "quite an exciting prospect indeed !",
    "now , from the point of view of the propagation of an acoustic signal of wavelength @xmath0 , a shear band of thickness @xmath1 in a confined granular medium appears as the equivalent of a frictional interface between two identical solids .",
    "indeed , the band can then be considered as a surface of mechanical discontinuity between the non sliding adjacent regions , which behave as ( disordered ) elastic solids .",
    "experimental studies by rock mechanicians @xcite @xcite of systems constituted of two bulk rock pieces separated by an interposed layer of granular material ( called `` gouge '' ) have established that in such systems ( i ) sliding occurs in a narrow band within the gouge ( ii ) the dynamics is ruled by a standard solid friction law , the associated friction coefficients having a magnitude comparable with those for solids in direct contact .",
    "reflection and transmission of waves with a polarization component along the sliding direction of an interface with constant friction coefficient between dissimilar media have been recently studied by nosonovsky and adams @xcite , though in a different perspective .",
    "namely , they focussed primarily on the possible generation of slip pulses - a dynamical feature that seems to be specific of pure coulombic friction .",
    "in the course of this article we will rederive some of their results , which will be extended to the more realistic case of velocity - dependent friction and to the shear band problem ..    this article is organized as follows .    in section 2 ,",
    "we first write down the equations for the most general case of a monochromatic acoustic wave incident upon a planar frictional interface between two semi - infinite solids with different elastic moduli .",
    "we then specialize in section 3 to the case where the elastic contrast between the two media is very large ( e.g. a gel sliding on top of a glass plate ) .",
    "we show that , if the stiffer medium is assumed strictly non deformable and friction taken to be coulomb - like , the reflection coefficient of a wave with the sliding direction and polarization in the plane of incidence is highly pathological : not only is a huge gain at reflection possible for some particular incidence range , but spontaneous acoustic emission from the surface is predicted - a result already obtained recently by nosonovsky and adams @xcite .",
    "these singularities are to be related with those already found by adams @xcite , and ranjith and rice @xcite , in their studies of interfacial waves in the same system .",
    "they result , as is well known in mechanics , from the specific singular character which the coulomb model , which takes the friction coefficient to be a mere constant , shares with the hill model of plasticity . indeed , we show that ( i ) a very small finite relative compliance of the stiffer medium is sufficient to destroy the acoustic emission singularity ( ii ) improving upon the coulomb description by taking into account a velocity - strengthening dependence of the dynamic friction coefficient of the order of what is measured for real systems also cures this singularity .",
    "moreover , the possibility of energy gain at reflection is found to be strongly dependent upon the strength of the velocity dependence , and hence on the type of system : while it should be negligible for a gel - on - glass system , it might be observable with a rough - on - flat multicontact interface in well defined incidence ranges .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the symmetric case of two mechanically identical solids relevant to the shear band problem .",
    "in this situation , and when the velocity dependence of the friction coefficient is taken into account , we predict that the sliding shear band should give rise to a clear acoustic signature - namely a reflection coefficient with magnitude of order typically of order unity for incident signals in well defined ranges of incidence angles .",
    "consider two elastically isotropic semi - infinite media ( m ; m ) with shear moduli and poisson ratios ( @xmath2 ) and densities ( @xmath3 ) , occupying respectively ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) the upper ( @xmath4 ) and lower ( @xmath5 ) half spaces , and in continuous contact with each other along the @xmath6 plane .",
    "medium ( m ) is assumed to be in stationary sliding motion with respect to ( m ) at velocity @xmath7 along @xmath8 and towards @xmath9 . in this reference state ,",
    "the ( homogeneous ) normal and shear stresses @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are related by the dynamic friction law :    @xmath12    with @xmath13 the friction coefficient .",
    "an emitter linked to ( m ) is sending from infinity towards the interface a plane acoustic wave of frequency @xmath14 , propagating in the @xmath15 plane at incidence angle @xmath16 ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) and polarized in the plane of incidence .",
    "that is , the associated displacement has a finite component along the sliding direction . in order to fix ideas , and for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we restrict in most of what follows the algebraic formulation to the case of a transverse ( shear ) incident wave - the case of an incident longitudinal ( dilatational ) signal follows straightforwardly . the elastic displacement field ( @xmath17 ) in ( m ) obeys the lam equations : @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20 are the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities in ( m ) , and    @xmath21    the solution of equations ( [ eq : lame1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lame2 ] ) reads :    @xmath22\\ ] ]    @xmath23\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 specifies the amplitude of the incident wave , @xmath25 is the @xmath8 component of its wavevector , and    @xmath26    with @xmath27 real positive and @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in the lower medium ( m ) , which moves at velocity @xmath30 in our reference frame , analogously :    @xmath31\\ ] ]    @xmath32\\ ] ]    where @xmath33    in order to determine the amplitude reflection ( @xmath34 ) and transmission ( @xmath35 ) coefficients into the transverse and longitudinal channels we must now specify the four boundary conditions ( bc ) to be satisfied along the _ deformed _ m / m interface .",
    "since the acoustic stresses we consider are small , @xmath36 , we expect the contact to persist everywhere , so that    \\(i ) normal displacements on both sides of the interface are equal : @xmath37 and mechanical equilibrium imposes continuity of normal and shear stresses :    \\(ii ) @xmath38    \\(iii ) @xmath39    the sliding velocity perturbation @xmath40 being also @xmath36 , @xmath41 remains positive ( sliding persists ) everywhere , and we assume that the dynamic friction condition now holds _ locally _ , namely that , at each interfacial point :    \\(iv ) @xmath42    these boundary conditions , which have been taken for granted in existing studies of interfacial waves and shear fractures , actually imply important physical assumptions , which should be made explicit .    on the one hand ,",
    "the ( macroscopic ) contact is supposed to be continuous and homogeneous - hence the statement of homogeneous stresses in the reference state .",
    "now , it is well known that such is not the prevalent case .",
    "most interfaces , being formed between rough solids , are actually constituted of a large , but rather sparse , set of microcontacts @xcite @xcite , in between which the surfaces are mechanically free .",
    "then , it is clear that conditions ( i)-(iii ) are valid only in a coarse - grained sense , i.e. provided that the length scale @xmath43 of variation of the acoustic fields along @xmath8 is much larger than the average distance @xmath44 between microcontacts , that is for @xmath45 .",
    "intercontact distances lie commonly in the range of hundreds of micrometers . only in the case where one at least of the solids is extremely compliant are macroscopic contacts truly continuous .",
    "this is for example the case for elastomers or gels .    on the other hand ,",
    "the mere existence of a finite static threshold proves that frictional dissipation results from the triggering by the applied shear of structural instabilities .",
    "it is now documented that the corresponding structural rearrangement events take place in the nanometer - thick adhesive interfacial layers , and affect volumes of , typically , nanometric scale @xcite @xcite - comparable with the `` shear transformation zones '' invoked by falk and langer @xcite to model the plasticity of amorphous solids .",
    "let us call @xmath46 the size of such a zone .",
    "a friction law represents the result of a _ statistical average _ over a large number of such dissipative events .",
    "so , it can only make sense on a scale much larger than @xmath46 , that is for @xmath47 .",
    "all this means that boundary conditions ( i)-(iv ) above must be understood as valid only on scales larger than some _ cut - off length _",
    "@xmath48 on the order of , typically , ( i ) a fraction of micrometer for conforming solid contacts ( ii ) a fraction of millimeter for the , more common , multicontact interfaces .",
    "finally , since @xmath41 now becomes a time - dependent quantity , condition ( iv ) implies that we assume the friction relation to hold instantaneously on the scale @xmath49 .",
    "it is known that this does not apply to the case where the steady state @xmath13 is velocity weakening ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "indeed , such behavior necessarily results from the action of some underlying structural dynamics leading to aging when sticking and rejuvenation upon sliding , such as that associated with the slow creep growth of the real area of contact relevant to multicontact interfaces@xcite @xcite .",
    "then , the equations describing non steady friction must involve explicitly at least one more dynamical `` state '' variable , and condition ( iv ) becomes insufficient .",
    "note also that it is in this regime that steady sliding may be unstable with respect to stick - slip .",
    "so , we restrict ourselves in what follows to the velocity - strengthening case @xmath51 .",
    "this can be expected to hold , for rough - on - rough interfaces , only at sliding velocities in the mm.sec@xmath52 range , large enough for rejuvenation effects to be saturated @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite to prevail down to the @xmath53m.sec@xmath52 range when working with rough - on - flat interfaces where contacts keep their identity when sliding , which makes contact area saturation easily realizable .",
    "the position of our deformed interface is given by    @xmath54    we assume from now on that acoustic deformations are small enough for us to work in the linearized approximation .",
    "then , the normal and tangent unit vectors @xmath55 are simply :    @xmath56    let the stress field in , say , m , be denoted @xmath57 , ( @xmath58 ) , with    @xmath59\\ ] ]    then , to first order , at the interface in m    @xmath60    @xmath61    and the local sliding velocity    @xmath62    conditions ( i)-(iv ) then become :    @xmath63}_{x_{1},0,t } = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath64}_{x_{1},0,t } = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath65}_{x_{1},0,t } = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath66}_{x_{1},0,t } = 0\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 , and we have set    @xmath68    @xmath69 ( compressive normal stress ) , @xmath70 , and we can reasonably assume sliding to occur under zero lateral stress , i.e. @xmath71 , so that , in general , @xmath72 .    note that the @xmath73-dependent terms in eqs ( [ eq : bc1])- ( [ eq : bc4 ] ) , which account for the fact that the bc s must be enforced along the _ deformed _ interface , have usually been overlooked in previous works on interfacial waves .",
    "as will appear below , they give rise to corrections on the order of @xmath74 . in the case of hard materials ,",
    "externally applied stresses are in practice always considerably smaller than elastic moduli , and these corrections can safely be neglected",
    ". however , such may not be the case when dealing with very compliant materials such as gels or elastomers .",
    "for example , for the case of gel / glass interfaces @xcite sliding stress levels may be a sizeable fraction of @xmath53 , and the full expressions should be retained .",
    "then , using eqs ( [ eq : u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , ( [ eq : u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : u2 ] ) and ( [ eq : contraintes ] ) , the bc s yield the following set of four non homogeneous linear equations for @xmath75 :    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79 \\alpha + \\left [ 2q_{l } + f\\frac{q_{t}^{2}-k^{2}}{k } - \\frac{\\tau^{*}}{\\mu } q_{l}\\right ] \\beta   \\hspace{80pt}\\nonumber\\\\ \\hspace{80pt}+ \\frac{af\\omega}{c_{t}}\\left(\\alpha + \\beta -\\alpha'-\\beta'\\right)= \\left[\\frac{q_{t}^{2}-k^{2}}{q_{t}}+ 2fk + \\frac{\\tau^{*}}{\\mu } \\frac{k^{2}}{q_{t}}\\right ] - \\frac{af\\omega}{c_{t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined :    @xmath80    which measures the dimensionless strength of the velocity - strengthening effect .    equations ( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a4 ] ) above are relevant to the case of a transverse incident wave .",
    "we will also display some results for a longitudinal one . in this latter case , the only modification concerns the first terms in the r.h.s .",
    "of equations ( [ eq : u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : u2 ] ) which give the expression of the total acoustic displacement field .",
    "this results in leaving the l.h.s.s of the final equations ( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a4 ] ) unchanged , only the r.h.s.s being modified .    since the general solution of our problem depends on a large number of parameters ( four elastic moduli , two densities , the angle of incidence , the friction coefficient and its derivative ) it will be more illuminating to focus on a few simple cases , namely that of very large elastic contrast ( quasi non deformable m ) , and the symmetric case of two identical materials , relevant to the problem of shear band detection .",
    "we consider here the case of maximum asymmetry , where m is considerably stiffer than m. in order to disentangle the respective effects of the elastic contrast ratio @xmath81 and of the velocity dependence of friction , we first treat the extra simple limit of a non deformable m and of pure coulomb friction , then examine how the results thus obtained are modified ( i ) when @xmath82 is large but finite ( ii ) when @xmath83 .",
    "the boundary conditions reduce to imposing that @xmath84 and @xmath85 along the @xmath86 plane .",
    "equations ( [ eq : a1])-([eq : a4 ] ) become , in this @xmath87 limit , where @xmath88 :    @xmath89    @xmath90\\alpha + \\left[-2q_{l}+f\\frac{k^{2}-q_{t}^{2}}{k}\\right]\\beta   = \\frac { k^{2}-q_{t}^{2}}{q_{t } } -2fk\\ ] ]    which yield for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 reflection coefficients :    @xmath93    where :    @xmath94    note that , for @xmath95 , and for incident waves propagating towards @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 .",
    "that is , at least in the limit of weak friction and in this incidence range , clearly @xmath99 , and the reflected energy flux is larger than the incident one . in order to try and clear up this a priori surprising prediction ,",
    "let us look in more detail into the question of energy balance in our system .",
    "consider the volume ( @xmath100 ) of a slice of unit depth along @xmath101 of medium ( m ) , limited by its area ( @xmath102 ) ( @xmath103 ) along the interface , and the semicylinder ( @xmath104 ) of radius @xmath105 ) .",
    "in the situation we are considering , of an incident wave of constant amplitude , the average over an acoustic period of the elastic energy stored within ( @xmath100 ) is time independent .",
    "this means that energy conservation simply imposes that the net energy flux at infinity @xmath106 , flowing out of @xmath104 , associated with the acoustic waves , must equal the increment associated with the acoustic perturbation of the work injected per unit time into the system via the work of the stresses acting on the moving interface , @xmath107 , which is pumped from the driving machine .",
    "this is proved in detail in the appendix , where we show that , in the present case on a non deformable m , per unit area of ( @xmath102 ) :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 stands for the average over the acoustic period .",
    "we then easily prove ( appendix a ) that this is exactly equal to the net acoustic energy flux :    @xmath110    in other words , a sliding frictional interface is in principle able to transform external incoherent mechanical work into coherent acoustic radiation - i.e. to act as an `` acoustic laser '' . in order to make this more precise , we plot on figure [ fig:2]a",
    "the relative powers reflected into the t and l channels , given by ( see appendix ) :    @xmath111    @xmath112    against the incidence angle @xmath113 and for @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "it is seen that , for all positive incidences , a transverse incident wave is predicted to be notably amplified upon reflection , while the power in the l channel remains quite small , even close to @xmath116 beyond which the l wave becomes evanescent , where it is maximum . however a much more surprising result , already derived by nosonovsky and adams @xcite is that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are found to diverge at a negative incidence @xmath119 , where the denominator @xmath120 ( eq.([eq : rigcb4 ] ) ) of the expressions for @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( eq.([eq : rigcb3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : qlt ] ) , the condition @xmath123 reads :    @xmath124    which is easily checked graphically to have a single negative solution @xmath125 with @xmath126 , whatever the values of @xmath127 and of @xmath128 .",
    "the smaller @xmath127 , the closer @xmath129 approaches @xmath130 .",
    "in the case shown on figure [ fig:2]a , @xmath131 . in the ccase ( figure [ fig:2]b ) of l incidence , the corresponding singularity occurs for @xmath16 close above @xmath132 in other words , in this admittedly oversimplified limit ( rigid m , pure coulomb friction ) , homogeneous sliding at constant velocity is impossible : indeed , any infinitesimal perturbation is able to trigger the emission , all along the interface , of a coupled set of transverse and longitudinal acoustic waves , of a priori undetermined amplitude , travelling respectively at angles @xmath129 and @xmath133 in the back direction @xmath134 . on the one hand",
    "this entails that an infinite external energy would be pumped in . on the other hand , as soon as the local interfacial velocity will vanish , the interface will stop ( stick ) .",
    "so this pathologic behavior signals that homogeneous sliding is here absolutely unstable - a signature to be added to that provided by the existence in such systems of amplified interfacial waves , first identified and studied by adams @xcite , which lead to the question of ill - posedness of the problem of interfacial slip pulses studied by several authors and recently synthetized by ranjith and rice @xcite . whether or not the stable mode of sliding for our model interface would be a set of square slip pulses such as calculated in ref.@xcite is out of the reach of this work .",
    "we will rather concentrate on a different question , namely : how robust is this pathology ?",
    "does it persist in the presence of ( i ) a finite elastic compliance of the stiffer medium m ; ( ii ) a velocity - strengthening dependence of the friction coefficient ?",
    "we now consider successively these two possibilities .",
    "let us now consider the case of a large but finite elastic contrast ratio @xmath135 .",
    "we assume for the sake of simplicity equality of the poisson ratios @xmath136 . in this case , except for quasi - normal incidence angles , @xmath137 : there is total reflection at the interface , with only evanescent transmission into m. @xmath121 and @xmath122 must now be obtained by solving the full equations ( [ eq : a1 ] ) - ( [ eq : a4 ] ) for constant @xmath127 . except in the vicinity of @xmath138 , a finite @xmath139 simply acts as a regular perturbation , leading to a correction @xmath140 . for @xmath141",
    ", however , one must consider in detail the behavior of the determinant @xmath142 of the system ( [ eq : a1 ] ) - ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "to first order in @xmath139 :    @xmath143    as seen above , the zero of @xmath120 always occurs for @xmath144 where @xmath145 , and hence @xmath120 , is real . on the other hand it appears that",
    ", for @xmath146 pure imaginary , @xmath147 is a complex quantity .",
    "so , no zero of @xmath148 which would evolve continuously from @xmath119 exists , and one finds that , for finite @xmath139 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 no longer diverge , but exhibit , in the vicinity of @xmath119 , a maximum of order @xmath82 : a finite compliance of m , however small it is , is sufficient to kill the pathology found in the totally rigid limit .",
    "this we have confirmed by computing the relative reflected powers @xmath149 for various values of @xmath82 .",
    "the results for @xmath117 are shown on figure [ fig:3 ] : the smaller @xmath82 , the lower the maximum of @xmath150 , which reduces to a few units for @xmath151 .",
    "of course , in practice , for @xmath152 , the very large values of the reflection coefficients at maximum mean that a very small incident amplitude @xmath24 would suffice to induce a finite response , such that @xmath153 would vanish , leading to interfacial stick - i.e. homogeneous slip , though no longer absolutely unstable from a strict mathematical point of view , would be very weakly stable , as it could not resist perturbations of finite but very small amplitude .",
    "the problem is now specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) in which @xmath88 , and the position of the singularity of @xmath34 , if any , is therefore given by the zero of :    @xmath154    where the dimensionless parameter measuring the velocity dependence effect is defined by equation ( [ eq : a5 ] ) :    @xmath155    when solving numerically for @xmath156 , we find that the singularity disappears for @xmath157 .",
    "more precisely , we find that , as @xmath158 increases , the zero of @xmath159 approaches @xmath160 , which it reaches for @xmath161 , beyond which it disappears , due to the fact that no zero can occur in the regime where the l wave is evanescent .",
    "the threshold value @xmath162 is independent of the value of @xmath13 , but it depends upon the sound velocity ratio . for a reasonable choice of this parameter ( @xmath163 ) ,",
    "@xmath162 is at most a few units .",
    "for example , for the presently used value @xmath164 , we obtain @xmath165 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated on figure [ fig:4 ] , where we plot the relative reflected power @xmath117 against incidence angle for various values of @xmath158 .",
    "it is also seen that the larger @xmath158 , the smaller the gain at reflection .",
    "it appears that at another characteristic @xmath158 value ( @xmath166 for our parameter values ) , the gain becomes negative ( @xmath167 ) for all incidences .",
    "that is , a strenghtening @xmath7-dependence of @xmath127 is very efficient to kill the amplification effect .",
    "it is therefore important to evaluate an order of magnitude of @xmath158 for real interfaces with a large elastic contrast , a good example of which is that of gel / glass couples .",
    "frictional sliding at the interface between glass and a 5% gelatin aqueous gel has recently been studied in detail by baumberger et al @xcite . using their data",
    ", we find that , for @xmath7 in the mm.sec@xmath52 range , @xmath168 sec.m@xmath52 , while @xmath169 m.sec@xmath52 , so that @xmath170 is a very large number .    in this @xmath171 limit",
    ", the rigid m version of equation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) reduces , to lowest order in @xmath172 , to :    @xmath173    that is , due to the high relative cost of increasing its instantaneous velocity , the interface remains locked to the homogeneous sliding state and @xmath174 .",
    "so , for gel / glass sytems , acoustic reflection should not in practice be able to distinguish between the static and the sliding interfaces .",
    "another realization of the high elastic contrast situation is provided by the multicontact interface between rough glassy pmma and atomically flat silanized glass , recently studied by bureau et al @xcite .",
    "for this couple , @xmath175 .",
    "thanks to the flatness of the glass surface , it is possible to saturate the slow growth of the real area of contact , which is responsible , in the case of rough - on - rough systems , for the velocity weakening behavior of the dynamic friction coefficient and of the associated stick - slip dynamics .",
    "then , for @xmath176m.sec@xmath52 , @xmath13 is velocity strenthening and of the form :    @xmath177\\ ] ]    where @xmath178 , and @xmath179 . with @xmath180 gpa , @xmath181m.sec@xmath52 , and under normal stresses on the order of @xmath182 kpa , one gets :    @xmath183    that is , for sliding velocities in the @xmath184m.sec@xmath52 range , @xmath158 is typically on the order of @xmath185 .",
    "finally , note that , since in this configuration the average distance between the micrometric regions which form the real area of contact is on the order of a fraction of millimeter , such an experiment would ask for acoustic signals in the range of of a few hundred khz at most , in order for our continuum description to be valid .",
    "the relative powers reflected into the two channels for t and l incident waves under these conditions are plotted on figures [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] , for @xmath186 .",
    "( since in this case typical values of @xmath187 and @xmath188 are @xmath189 , calculations have been performed for @xmath190 , @xmath191 . )",
    "inspection of these results and comparison with the case of the non moving interface ( figure [ fig:7 ] ) lead us to the following conclusions .",
    "* the more favorable channels for observing gain at reflection are the diagonal ( ll and tt ) ones . * in both cases , a very narrow peak of @xmath150 , reminiscent of the singularity obtained in the limit of coulomb friction on a rigid substrate , is predicted for @xmath192 . however , due to its narrowness , observing it would be certainly be excessively demanding in terms of directional accuracy .",
    "* it thus appears more feasible to investigate one of the two following configurations : ll at large negative incidence angles , in the range of @xmath193 , and ( tt ) at large positive incidence @xmath194 . *",
    "gain decreases very rapidly with increasing @xmath158 , i.e. with decreasing @xmath7 ( see eq.([eq : rigcb15 ] ) ) : while , for @xmath195 it reaches up to @xmath196 in ( ll ) and @xmath197 in ( tt ) , already for @xmath198 it has practically collapsed to zero .",
    "so , according to equation ( [ eq : rigcb15 ] ) , the best situation corresponds to the largest possible driving velocities , in practice in the range of a fraction of mm / sec .    with these conditions in mind",
    ", it seems quite possible to obtain substantial acoustic gain at reflection on a sliding rough - on - flat multicontact interface .",
    "we now turn to the opposite limit where m and m have the same elastic properties .",
    "it is a priori relevant to the case of multicontact interfaces between two pieces of the same material .",
    "however , the above mentioned rough - on - flat configuration is inappropriate in this case , since the asperities on the rough surface would give rise on the flat one to unavoidable and poorly qualified plastic damage and wear effects . on the other hand , as already mentioned , in the rough - on - rough configuration where such problems are irrelevant , geometric aging interrupted by motion results in a velocity - weakening behavior of @xmath13 for velocities up to at least the mm.sec@xmath52 range , not very easy to acess in a stationary sliding laboratory experiment .",
    "so , such symmetric solid on solid interfaces turn out not to be well adapted in practice to test our predictions .",
    "the most interesting case , as already mentioned in section i , is that of an established shear band , in particular in a highly confined granular medium . in such highly disordered systems , internal stress inhomogeneities ( the so - called stress - chain phenomenon ) of course",
    "give rise to scattering of acoustic waves .",
    "however , this is all the smaller that the effective acoustic wavelength in the medium is larger with respect to the correlation length of stress fluctuations , known to be on the order of a few grain diameters @xmath199 only . in this @xmath200 limit , as shown by experiments on the propagation of acoustic pulses @xcite , where one can separate out unambiguously the signal corresponding to the propagation of a `` coherent pulse '' , a description in terms of an effective acoustic medium is legitimate .",
    "note that , as shear band thickness is also expected to be , for low shearing rates , on the order of a few @xmath199 , @xmath200 also ensures that we can safely neglect it when dealing with our reflection - transmission problem .",
    "laboratory experiments on the frictional behavior of layers of granular rock confined between granite plates @xcite @xcite , and of glass bead assemblies @xcite have shown that sheared confined granular media obey standard friction laws - namely , beyond a static threshold , @xmath201 .",
    "however , the velocity dependence of the dynamic friction coefficient is not yet very clearly established . the data on rock point towards weakening at low velocities .",
    "however , they are strongly dependent upon the level of humidity . this , together with the very small size of the grains used in these experiments , strongly suggests that capillary condensation around the intergrain hertz contacts is responsible for a slow strengthening of the medium , interrupted by sliding , which should become negligible either at low humidity or for larger grains . on the other hand , in the absence of such slow transients ,",
    "since granular systems are essentially athermal , one expects logarithmic dynamic strengthening of the type found for multicontact interfaces ( see equation ( [ eq : rigcb15 ] ) ) , which results from thermal activation effects @xcite @xcite , to be completely negligible .",
    "if such is the case , @xmath127 would be @xmath7- independent in the low velocity , quasi static sliding regime .",
    "note that this is what has be found by geminard et al @xcite for glass beads completely immersed in water - though under relatively weak confinement .",
    "so , let us first consider the simplified case of pure coulomb friction ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "we then solve the corresponding version of eqs.([eq : a1 ] ) - ( [ eq : a4 ] ) where we neglect @xmath187 , since , for the confined granular systems made of hard materials ( such as glass or steel ) which we have in mind , under ordinary experimental conditions @xcite @xcite , this does not exceed , typically , @xmath203 at most .",
    "moreover , as we are interested here in strongly subsonic sliding velocities ( @xmath204 ) , @xmath205 .",
    "the results for the four relative reflected powers are plotted on figure [ fig:8 ] for the case @xmath114 : while , in the ( tt ) channel , for negative @xmath16 there is loss at reflection , @xmath117 is seen to be sizeable everywhere in the range ( @xmath206 ) where a propagating l reflected wave exists , as well as for quasi - grazing conditions . for @xmath207",
    "the reflectance curve exhibits cusp - like maxima - a standard behavior for multichannel scattering cross sections at the closing point of a channel . about @xmath208",
    ", we even predict a gain of more than @xmath209 , which becomes much larger for @xmath210 . in the other three channels ,",
    "@xmath150 is much smaller - except , for the ll one , in quasi - grazing conditions which are hardly realizable in practice .",
    "this behavior is to be contrasted with what is expected from non localized homogeneous shear sliding , namely undisturbed propagation all through the sample .",
    "so , one expects the following to happen after starting to shear a confined sample at a constant rate , if a transverse acoustic pulse is sent into the granular pack in the direction normal to the shearing plane . at very short times ,",
    "when the stress has not yet reached the sliding threshold , the system experiences uniform elastic deformation , the incident pulse will give rise to a `` coherent '' reflected one , which will have travelled way and back _ across the whole container_. after the initial sliding transient corresponding to the gradual installation of the shear band , during which fluctuations are expected to kill the coherent signal , _ the reflected pulse should reappear , but with a distinctly shorter travelling time _",
    ", thus providing a clear signature of shear localization .",
    "note that , since its travelling length is reduced , so will be the attenuation due to scattering by stress fluctuations , making it more easy to detect than the former signal .",
    "finally , when sliding is stopped , the situation should revert practically to that before shearing , though the density contrast @xmath211 , on the order of a few @xmath212 at most , associated with the shear band @xcite still persists . indeed , then , @xmath213 is negligibly small , and pulse reflection only occurs , again , at the bottom end of the container .",
    "the question is then to check how robust the reflectance characteristics predicted for @xmath202 are with respect to a possible , though probably small , velocity strengthening dependence of the friction coefficient .",
    "it is seen on figure [ fig:9 ] that , although , as expected , @xmath117 decreases as @xmath158 grows , at normal incidence it remains non negligible up to the sizeable value @xmath214 , where it still is on the order of @xmath215 .",
    "in summary , from the above results , we conclude to the interest of performing experimental studies of the reflection of acoustic pulses on sliding solid interfaces and shear bands , the potential interest of which is different in each case .    as discussed in section iii.c , experiments with a rough - on - flat multicontact interface",
    "open the possibility of obtaining acoustic gain , through the conversion by the frictional system of incoherent mechanical energy pumped from the driving system into coherent acoustic vibrations",
    ". however , such experiments are certainly delicate to realize , since they ask for working at non normal incidences , and , due to the effect of velocity strengthening of dynamic friction coefficients , at not very small velocities , in the range of typically a few hundred @xmath53m / sec .",
    "on the other hand , acoustic pulse reflection appears as a promising method for detecting shear localization in a confined granular medium . the best configuration - a transverse pulse at normal incidence - is more easily realizable since it may be implemented with a single transducer acting as both emitter and receiver .",
    "moreover , the expected signature ( a strongly reduced transit time before return of the reflected pulse ) should be easy to identify - its presence confirming at the same time the expected quasi - independence of the sliding stress on the sliding velocity .",
    "we therefore strongly hope that this work will motivate such experiments in the near future .",
    "b.v . gratefully acknowledges the hospitality of universit paris vii .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a rigid substrate with an infinite elastic contrast @xmath216 considered in sec .",
    "[ basic_case ] .",
    "this situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , which concerns specifically the case of a transverse wave incident below the critical angle @xmath130 , so that also the longitudinal reflected wave is propagating . in our 2d geometry ,",
    "the incident beam irradiates a strip @xmath217 of the interface perpendicular to the sliding direction @xmath218 and extending from @xmath219 to @xmath220 along this direction .",
    "it has an area @xmath217 per unit length along @xmath221 .",
    "the reflected beams stem from the irradiated area .",
    "the beams are wide enough to make the fringe effects negligible and easy to exclude as additive constants to the principal quantities proportional to @xmath217 .",
    "the @xmath217 strip is now overlapped by a wider region @xmath102 stretching from @xmath222 to @xmath223 such that a semicylindrical dome @xmath224 raised over it encloses the regions of beam overlap and interference ( as well as the fields of attenuated waves , should they arise ) .",
    "the bottom of the dome is infinitesimally above the interface , so that the equations of motion ( [ eq : lame1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lame2 ] ) are valid both inside and on the surface of the region @xmath100 enclosed by the dome and the bottom plane .",
    "then , the total elastic energy @xmath225 inside the dome can be studied using the differential energy conservation law @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the local energy density , whose form will not be needed , and the energy current density @xmath228 is given by @xmath229 we consider elastic fields having a steady homogeneous component and a single frequency acoustic component . as usual , in bilinear expressions like eq .",
    "( [ eq : defj ] ) , we turn to real parts of all quantities involved , which is consistent in a linear theory .",
    "thus , we have @xmath230 @xmath231 introducing this into ( [ eq : defj ] ) , we may single out the steady flow component of @xmath228 by averaging over the period @xmath232 : @xmath233 where overbar denotes complex conjugation . the time average @xmath234 of the total elastic energy per unit length of the @xmath100 region for a stationary irradiation is zero .",
    "integration of the time average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ecl ] ) then yields a balance equation for the steady time averaged energy flows across the surface of @xmath100 : @xmath235 with @xmath236 the outer normal of @xmath100 . with the sign conventions of figure [ fig:10 ] , we obtain the following relation for the gain @xmath237 , defined as the imbalance between the incident and reflected energy flows : @xmath238 the energy flows associated with the plane wave beams crossing the dome @xmath224 are easily obtained , if we use the well known steady current density for a plane wave @xcite @xmath239 valid for both polarizations ; the quantity @xmath240 is a possibly complex amplitude . the plane waves appearing in ( [ eq : gaindef ] ) are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : u2 ] ) . the coefficients @xmath241",
    "were obtained in sec .",
    "[ basic_case ] .",
    "the three total energy flows are the products of current densities and beam cross sections .",
    "thus ,        it remains to interpret the right hand side @xmath245 of ( [ eq : gaindef ] ) .",
    "first , using explicit expressions ( [ eq : defj ] ) , ( [ eq : jav ] ) for @xmath228 , @xmath246 , we obtain ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : rigcb5 ] ) ) @xmath247 @xmath248 eq .",
    "( [ eq : wext2 ] ) may serve to check equation ( [ eq : gaindef ] ) explicitly .",
    "two points appear explicitly : _",
    "( i ) _ only those irradiated parts of the interface where @xmath249 do contribute : the effect is connected with the free sliding of the interface points along the sliding direction . _",
    "( ii ) _ all three waves superimposed enter @xmath245 .",
    "this is particularly remarkable in the case of an evanescent l wave , in which there is no longitudinal flow at infinity , yet the energy gain at the interface can not be obtained correctly without including the l wave contribution right at the interface .    at each point of the interface ,",
    "the external force acting on medium @xmath250 is @xmath251 the time average is @xmath252 the averaged macroscopic force acting on @xmath102 is thus @xmath253 .",
    "medium @xmath254 is pulled at the overall velocity @xmath255 , thus the power spent by this force is @xmath256 , independently of the presence of oscillatory acoustic fields .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath257 the first term is the power dissipated against the friction forces : @xmath258 is the local relative interfacial velocity , while @xmath259 has only a frictional component along the interface . equation ( [ eq : power ] ) thus expresses the partitioning of the total work done per unit time by the external force into the ( irreversibly ) dissipated power and the net acoustic gain .",
