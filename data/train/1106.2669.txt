    "high angular resolution observations of weak radio sources ( where self calibration is not possible ) require calibrator sources for correction of systematic effects and effects of the atmosphere on the measured visibilities .",
    "atmospheric fluctuations cause perturbations in visibility phase which , if not corrected , seriously limit both the sensitivity and image quality of an interferometric array .",
    "phase calibrators are also required for astrometric observations .",
    "an ideal calibrator would look the same on all observing baselines .",
    "it should be bright , unresolved , or at least compact and should not vary .",
    "a calibrator source should also be separated from the target sources by as small an angle as possible in order to look along the same line of sight through the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have calibrator sources evenly distributed across the whole sky . in practice , at radio wavelengths , calibrators are mostly active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , whose fundamental source of power is believed to be the accretion of matter onto a super - massive black hole @xcite .",
    "they are known to vary at every wavelength at which they have been studied .",
    "agn are very compact and isotropically distributed around the sky .",
    "they are also very distant objects and therefore , generally , have no discernible proper motions on the sky .",
    "it is these qualities that make them suitable as calibrators at radio wavelengths .    due to the limited number of radio telescopes ,",
    "few surveys for calibrators have been carried out in the southern hemisphere @xcite . hence , there are fewer known calibrators in the south .",
    "a major expansion of radio astronomy observing capability is underway in the southern hemisphere .",
    "two ska ( square kilometre array ) precursors , the south african meerkat ( karoo array telescope , @xcite ) and askap ( australian ska pathfinder , @xcite ) are presently under construction , leading to the ska itself .",
    "it is clear that interferometry and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) in the southern hemisphere needs a dense network of calibration sources at high resolutions and a range of frequencies .",
    "meerkat is the south african ska demonstrator telescope . when completed , it will be the largest radio telescope array in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it will operate in two frequency ranges , 0.58 - 2.5  ghz and 8 - 14.5  ghz @xcite .",
    "meerkat will participate in vlbi observations with the european vlbi network and other vlbi arrays .",
    "the ska will operate in the frequency range 0.7 to 25  ghz @xcite and is expected to have much longer baselines for which a southern vlbi calibrator list will be essential .    the united states naval observatory , in collaboration with nasa , the laboratoire dastrophysique de bordeaux ( lab ) and the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) has , since 1994 been observing agn , once every two months , through the research and development vlbi ( rdv ) experiments .",
    "this has led to a wealth of data of sources observed simultaneously at 2.3  ghz and 8.4  ghz at regular epochs .",
    "images of these agn form the usno s radio reference frame image database ( rrfid ) and lab s bordeaux vlbi image database ( bvid ) @xcite .",
    "the rrfid is a database of about 6700 images of over 700 agn sources compiled from geodetic and astrometric vlbi experiments .",
    "the bvid contains over 1800 images of 824 radio sources .",
    "it is the goal of the ongoing rdv program to image the radio reference frame sources on a regular basis , to monitor them for variability and structural change .",
    "@xcite discuss jet kinematics in a subset of the rrfid sources , concentrating on the 8.4  ghz observations .",
    "their survey is made up of rrfid sources that have been observed at 3 or more epochs from july 1994 to december 1998 .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on 2.3 ghz observations of a sample of 31 potential southern vlbi calibrators ( with declinations between 0 and @xmath0 ) from the kinematic survey of @xcite .",
    "the choice of 2.3 ghz was made because both meerkat and askap will be operating at frequencies close to this .",
    "we seek to characterise this selection of southern radio sources , and determine their suitability as calibrators for southern vlbi experiments , especially those using meerkat and the ska when completed .    in the following sections",
    ", we will describe the observations and data reduction process .",
    "we will then describe the imaging and modelfitting process and go on to analyse the data and discuss the results .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we modelfitted up to 32 epochs of observations ( average of 20 epochs ) for each of the 31 sources in our sample which was selected from the rrfid kinematic survey @xcite and determined their suitability as phase calibrators .",
    "while the kinematic survey looks more at proper motion in the sources at 8.4  ghz , this paper concentrates on the morphological properties of the sources at 2.3  ghz , a frequency more relevant to emerging southern hemisphere arrays like meerkat and askap .",
    "we have developed a method to classify radio sources according to their suitability as phase calibrators for radio interferometers .",
    "we first characterize a source by calculating several metrics which give measures of the degree to which the core dominates the source , and the degree of variability , both in flux density , and the degree to which the source is extended .",
    "these metrics are then combined to give the source a total score , which is used to assign the source to one of five classes of suitability as a calibrator .",
    "all 31 sources in our sample were classified as ` good ' calibrators with 28 classified as ` very good ' or better .",
    "fh is supported by a grant from the south african ska project and hartrao .",
    "fh thanks the united states naval observatory for their hospitality during two visits in 2008 and 2010 .",
    "this research has made use of the united states naval observatory ( usno ) radio reference frame image database ( rrfid ) and laboratoire dastrophysique de bordeaux ( lab ) bordeaux vlbi image database ( bvid ) .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
