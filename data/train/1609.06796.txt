    "more than 50 years ago a very simple model hamiltonian was proposed by e.t . jaynes and f.w .",
    "cummings ( jc ) to study the interaction between a two - level atom and a quantized single mode field @xcite .",
    "the aim of the authors was to compare the quantum theory with the semi - classical one for the radiation field .",
    "initially , no difference was observed , either using a classical field @xmath5 or a quantized field assumed in one of the most nonclassical state , as the number state @xmath6 .",
    "next , 17 years later a new calculation by eberly et al in 1980 @xcite was implemented assuming the field initially in a coherent state ; they showed the atom exhibiting a new nonclassical effect , then named as collapse and revival  of the atomic inversion .",
    "the effect was observed experimentally in 1987 by g. rempe et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "the jc model is written in the form ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 in the eq.([e1 ] ) @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) stands for the annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the lowering ( raising ) operator , @xmath13 is the number operator , @xmath14 @xmath15 is the field ( atomic ) frequency , and @xmath16 stands for the atom - field coupling .",
    "one identifies @xmath17  as the free hamiltonian  whereas @xmath18 @xmath19  is the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "when @xmath20 @xmath21 the atom and the radiation field are resonant and we have @xmath22=0 $ ] ; as consequence the interaction @xmath23 in the interaction picture is the same , namely , @xmath24 , and this makes easier the subsequent calculations .",
    "now , when @xmath25 the atom and the field are no longer in resonance ; in this case two alternatives may occur : they can be either near the resonance , which means @xmath26 or far from resonance , @xmath27 .",
    "in the first case we sum and subtract @xmath28 to the resonant case and obtain ,    @xmath29    in eq.([e2 ] ) , the following changes took place : the new free hamiltonian  is @xmath30 whereas @xmath31stands for the new and effective interaction . then , while @xmath32\\neq 0 $ ]  we have that @xmath33=0 $ ] and , as consequence , the subsequent calculations become easier again , since @xmath34 . in both previous cases ( in - resonance and off - resonance )",
    "we get exact solutions .",
    "now , when the detuning @xmath35 is large , namely : @xmath36 , the mentioned easiness to solve the problem no longer occurs . in this case a good approximation can be obtained from an equivalent  interaction hamiltonian @xmath37 , constructed from the eq.([e2 ] ) , named dispersive jc model , given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the effective coupling involving the parameter @xmath40 and the frequency shift @xmath35  of the cavity ( detuning @xmath41 ) .",
    "the eq.([e3 ] ) represents the dispersive jc model : it describes the field interacting with a 2-level atom , with respect to the levels @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath43 represents a virtual state .",
    "hence , when initially an atom previously prepared in a superposed state @xmath44 @xcite enters a microwave cavity that contains a field in an arbitrary normalized state latexmath:[$%    and the field with respect to the atomic levels @xmath42 and @xmath46 .    in this scenario",
    ", the unitary operator @xmath47 $ ] describes in which way the atom - field system evolves in time .",
    "thus we have , @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{e4}\\]]next , after using some algebra involving the equality @xmath49 we obtain the _ entangled _ state , with @xmath50 @xmath51    the eq.([e5 ] ) shows that the dispersive interaction affects only the phase of the field , thus no exchange of energy occurs between the atom and the field .",
    "also , the eq.([e5 ] ) corresponds to the state of the combined atom - field system right after the atom has crossed the cavity , at an intant of time @xmath52 .",
    "the evolution of the field state occurs during the atom - field interaction in the time interval @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is defined by the speed of the atom and the length of the cavity .",
    "the jc model in these three versions : resonant , near resonance , and far from resonance , has been explored by many researchers . as examples of works in the first scenario we mention the refs .",
    "@xcite ; in the second scenario @xcite and in the third @xcite . in the latter case , the approach became important to treat the schrdinger cat problem @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the jc model may include various extensions : one of them adds the counter rotating term @xmath55 to the usual interaction @xcite ; it comes from the original interaction , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; another extension treats the case of multiphoton interaction @xmath59,$ ] @xmath60 @xcite ; etc .",
    "other kinds of extensions also appear in the literature : one of them extends the jc model to another , named buck - sukumar model buck ; another interpolates between the jc model to the sivakumar model @xcite ; yet another going from the jc model to the rodrguez  lara model @xcite ; a model that includes ` _ _ quonic _ _ ' particles was also proposed : it extends the jc model to the shanta - chaturvedi - arinivasan model @xcite .",
    "a generalized model ( vb model ) that includes all these previous ( _ bosonic _ ) models has been proposed @xcite .",
    "although not very usual , the jc model is also treated in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "now , according to the eq.([e5]),if we let the traveling atom traverse a second ramsey zone @xcite , this apparatus leads the atom in the state @xmath42 to the superposed state @xmath61 and leads the atom in the state @xmath46 to @xmath62",
    ". then we get , @xmath63where @xmath64 .",
    "next , if the atom is detected in its ground state @xmath46 , the field inside cavity is projected in the even superposition @xmath65 . as an application we assume the field state initially in the normalized superposition of two excited number state @xcite : @xmath66 . substituting this state in the eq.([e6 ] ) we obtain the evolved field in the state , with @xmath67 , @xmath68 \\notag   \\label{e7 } \\\\ & = & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}[e^{\\frac{i\\phi n_{1}}{2}}(\\cos \\frac{\\phi n_{1}}{2}% ) |n_{1}\\rangle + e^{\\frac{i\\phi n_{2}}{2}}(\\cos \\frac{\\phi n_{2}}{2}% ) |n_{2}\\rangle ] .",
    "\\notag \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\]]we now can write the normalized state as @xmath69 ,   \\label{e8}\\]]where @xmath70 is the normalization factor , with @xmath71 @xmath72",
    "the result in eq.([e8 ] ) allows us to obtain statistical properties of the field , as follows :      from the eq.([e8 ] ) we obtain the time evolution of the statistical distribution @xmath73 .",
    "we have ,    @xmath74    since in this case we find that @xmath75 for all times , then the relevant behavior concerns the statistics @xmath76 and @xmath77 they show in which way the exchange of excitations occurs between the components @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "figs.[f1](a ) , [ f1](b ) , [ f1](c ) and [ f1](d ) show the time evolution of the statistical distributions @xmath76 and @xmath80 for the field in the state @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the behaviors of these distributions are oscillatory , e.g. , with period @xmath83 for the pairs ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and ( @xmath84 , @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 for the pair ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 for the pair ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "we note that , although having different periods , all pairs @xmath93 and @xmath94 have the same behavior when @xmath95 , with @xmath96 in addition we observe that when @xmath97 all field excitation concentrates into the component @xmath98 , as it should . for example , the state @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( in fig.[f1](a ) ) and at @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( in fig.[f1](c ) ) . at these points",
    "the entire field state becomes a number state , @xmath103     and @xmath104 , it shows in which way these components exchange their energies : ( a ) for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ; ( b ) for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; ( c ) for @xmath84 and @xmath105 ; ( d ) for @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]",
    "the mandel parameter informs whether the statistics is either poissonian , sub - poissonian or super - poissonian @xcite . to this end",
    "we must first calculate the variance of photon number , @xmath106 from the eq.([e8 ] ) we obtain , for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , @xmath111 ,   \\label{e9}\\]]@xmath112 ,   \\label{e10}\\]]and @xmath109 is obtained from the eq.([e9 ] ) .",

    "all plots in fig.[f2](a ) exhibit the sub - poissonian effect ( @xmath121 ) during their respective periods @xmath122 and @xmath123 for the pairs @xmath124 : @xmath125 and @xmath116 , respectively . in fig.[f2](b )",
    "the pair @xmath126 exhibit sub - poissonian effect during all period , however , the pair ( @xmath127 ) exhibit sub- and super - poissonian effect during the period @xmath128 .",
    "the sub - poissonian effect is shown for very short time intervals in fig.[f2](c ) ; concerning the fig.[f2](c ) , the state remains sub - poissonian for times in the respective periods , as also shown in fig.[f2](b ) .",
    "now , all results obtained above can be extended to initial field states with two fock components having unequal weights , e.g. , @xmath129 with @xmath130  @xmath131 . at this point a few words should be devoted on how to get an available initial superposed state of the type used here , as @xmath132 or one of its extensions . in fig.([f3 ] ) below , the fig.[f3](a ) represents a coherent state @xmath133 inside a good cavity . as well known , by making a conveniently prepared two - level atom that crosses the cavity and interacts with a coherent state , it transforms the coherent state into a superposition of two coherent states , including the so called schrodinger - cat  state when a rotation by an angle @xmath134 in the phase space affects the coherent state @xcite .     and",

    "fig.[f3](b ) is one of the results when passing two atoms , for the states @xmath155 and @xmath156 ; fig.[f3](c ) concerns the case of three atoms , leading to the states @xmath157 and @xmath158 ; fig.[f3](d ) is the case of four atoms leading to the states @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "other pairs of fock components can also be obtained , as the approximate pair @xmath160 conclusion ----------    the plots of the statistical distributions @xmath161 and @xmath162  show in which way the field state @xmath163 shares its excitation to components @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we note the similarities that occur for the pairs of components @xmath164 @xmath165 when @xmath166 @xmath167 ; they show the same behavior , but in different periods , e.g. , one of them being @xmath54 the other is @xmath168 the plots of the mandel parameter show the occurrence of sub - poissonian statistics in fig.[f2](a ) and ( partial ) super - poissonian statistics in fig.[f2](b ) and [ f2](c).moreover , we verify that the larger the difference between the values @xmath169 and @xmath4 @xmath170 , the larger is the super - poissonian character of the statistics .",
    "again , the same similarities found in fig.f1 is also observed in fig.[f2 ] for the case @xmath171 . during all the state evolution",
    "no squeezing effect was observed and , according to the ref.@xcite , one would observe this effect only when the field state @xmath163 can distribute his excitation to more than two fock components .",
