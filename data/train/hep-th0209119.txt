    "in this note , we continue our investigation @xcite of the phenomenological implications of `` stringy '' commutation relations @xcite which embody the minimal length uncertainty relation @xmath1 of perturbative string theory @xcite . in particular , we study the classical limit of the `` deformed '' commutation relations @xmath2   & = & i\\hbar \\left\\ { ( 1 + \\beta \\hat{p}^2 ) \\,\\delta_{ij }                           + \\beta ' \\hat{p}_i \\hat{p}_j               \\right\\ } \\;,\\cr \\left[\\hat{p}_i,\\hat{p}_j\\right ]   & = & 0 \\;,\\cr \\left[\\hat{x}_i,\\hat{x}_j\\right ] & = & i\\hbar\\,\\frac{(2\\beta-\\beta ' ) + ( 2\\beta+\\beta')\\beta \\hat{p}^2 }                    { ( 1+\\beta \\hat{p}^2 ) }        \\left ( \\hat{p}_i \\hat{x}_j - \\hat{p}_j \\hat{x}_i \\right)\\ ; , \\label{stringy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to the following `` deformed '' poisson brackets , @xmath3 the classical poisson bracket is required to possess the same properties as the quantum mechanical commutator , namely , it must be anti - symmetric , bilinear , and satisfy the leibniz rules and the jacobi identity .",
    "these requirements allow us to derive the general form of our poisson bracket for any functions of the coordinates and momenta as @xcite @xmath4 where repeated indices are summed .",
    "thus , the time evolutions of the coordinates and momenta in our `` deformed '' classical mechanics are governed by @xmath5    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we analyzed the motion of objects in central force potentials subject to these equations and found that orbits in @xmath6 and @xmath7 potentials no longer close on themselves when @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 are non - zero .",
    "this allowed us to place a stringent limit on the value of the minimal length from the observed precession of the perihelion of mercury , @xmath10 which was 33 orders of magnitude below the planck length .    the natural question to ask next",
    "is whether there exist other `` deformations '' of classical mechanics due to @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 that are either 1 ) observable even for such a small value of @xmath11 , or 2 ) lead to an even more stringent limit due to their absence . in the following , we will look at the `` deformation '' of kepler s third law . we will find that while the deformation is not observable on the scale of the solar system , it may be observable at galactic scales .",
    "in fact , such an effect may have already been seen in the rotation curves of gas and stars in spiral galaxies .",
    "before we investigate the deformation of kepler s third law , it is worthwhile to discuss some peculiarities of this novel classical dynamics .",
    "first , it is obvious that the poisson bracket @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson1 ] ) is not invariant under translations since it is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "for the special case of @xmath14 , the poisson bracket @xmath12 is zero to order @xmath15 and we can recover approximate translational invariance @xcite .",
    "second , it is not obvious how to extend the fundamental poisson brackets to multi - particle systems , nor how to define appropriate ` canonical transformations ' that leave the fundamental poisson bracket invariant , even in the case of one - particle systems .",
    "for instance , consider the motion of 2 bodies of equal mass in 1d .",
    "let us assume that the dynamics will be described by two sets of ` canonical ' variables , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which satisfy @xmath18 compare this expression to the multi - dimensional case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson1 ] ) .",
    "the right hand side of the first line is not @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , but @xmath21 .",
    "this allows us to assume @xmath22 .",
    "if we change the variables naively to those of the center of mass frame , @xmath23 then we find that the sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 are no longer ` canonical ' .",
    "of course , in this deformed dynamics momentum is no longer equal to _ _",
    "mass__@xmath26_velocity _ in general , so it is not surprising that the ` canonical ' momentum of the center of mass , if it exists , is not equal to the sum of momenta of the individual masses .",
    "third , consider 1d motion with the hamiltonian given by @xmath27 we will not consider any deformations of the hamiltonian itself though it is conceivable that some sort of modification may be required for the consistency of the theory . the equations of motion read @xmath28 as mentioned above , the momentum @xmath29 is no longer equal to @xmath30 . from these equations",
    ", we can derive @xmath31 where @xmath32 thus we obtain a deformation of newton s second law @xmath33 .",
    "now , notice that if the force @xmath34 is gravitational and proportional to the mass @xmath35 , the acceleration @xmath36 is not mass - independent as usual because of the residual @xmath35-dependence through the momentum @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ modfma ] ) the equivalence principle is dynamically violated .",
    "it should be noted that the equivalence principle is already known to be violated in the context of perturbative string theory @xcite .",
    "fundamental strings , due to their extended nature , are subject to tidal forces and do not follow geodesics .",
    "however , in contrast to the current discussion where the systems under consideration are of macroscopic dimensions , the violation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite was microscopic in nature .",
    "whether this is another example of uv / ir correspondence in string theory remains to be seen .",
    "let us now consider the motion of an object in a general central force potential where the hamiltonian is given by @xmath37 we will apply the results of this section later to the case when @xmath38 is the gravitational potential and derive a `` deformed '' version of kepler s third law .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) leads to the conservation of the ` deformed ' angular momentum @xmath39 which in turn implies that the motion will be confined to a 2-dimensional plane .",
    "expressing the position of the object in the plane in polar coordinates @xmath40 , the equations of motion can be cast into the form @xmath41\\,p_r",
    "\\;,\\cr \\dot{p}_r   & = & \\frac{1}{mr}[\\,1 + ( \\beta + \\beta ' ) p^2\\ , ] \\left\\ { ( p^2 - p_r^2 )       - \\left ( mr\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r } \\right )         \\left ( \\frac { 1 - \\beta p^2 + 2\\beta p_r^2 } { 1 + \\beta p^2 }          \\right ) \\right\\}\\;,\\cr \\dot{\\phi } & = & \\frac{l}{mr^2 }        \\left\\ { [ \\,1+(\\beta+\\beta')p^2 \\ , ] ( 1+\\beta p^2 )              + [ \\,(2\\beta-\\beta ' ) + ( 2\\beta+\\beta')\\beta p^2 \\ , ]                \\left ( mr\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r } \\right )        \\right\\}\\ ; , \\label{randphieq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 we restrict our attention to circular orbits and impose the constraints @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these conditions lead to @xmath45 and @xmath46 the radius of the orbit @xmath47 , and the magnitude of the momentum @xmath48 are now constants of motion .",
    "so is the angular velocity @xmath49 which can be expressed as @xmath50              + \\frac { ( 2\\beta-\\beta ' ) + ( 2\\beta+\\beta ' ) \\beta p^2 }                     { ( 1 + \\beta p^2 ) }                \\left ( mr\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r } \\right )        \\right\\ } \\cr & = & \\frac{p}{mr }        \\left\\ { [ \\,1 + ( \\beta + \\beta')p^2\\ , ]              + \\frac { ( 2\\beta-\\beta ' ) + ( 2\\beta+\\beta ' ) \\beta p^2 }                     { ( 1 - \\beta p^2 ) } \\ , p^2        \\right\\ } \\cr & = & \\left(\\frac{p}{mr}\\right )        \\frac{(1+\\beta p^2)^2}{(1-\\beta p^2)}\\;. \\label{omegaeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving eq .",
    "( [ p2eq ] ) for @xmath29 and substituting into eq .",
    "( [ omegaeq ] ) yields @xmath51 where @xmath52 \\;,\\cr \\varepsilon   & \\equiv & \\beta mr\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath53 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath54 which behaves as @xmath55 the graph of @xmath53 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that @xmath9 does not appear in our expression for @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the orbital period @xmath57 is not affected by @xmath9 . in particular , it is independent of whether approximate translational invariance ( @xmath14 ) is realized or not . note also that @xmath54 , and thus the deformation factor @xmath53 , depends not only on @xmath47 but also on @xmath35 . as was the case with eq .",
    "( [ modfma ] ) , this last fact can be interpreted as the dynamical violation of the equivalence principle when our formalism is applied to motion in gravitational fields .",
    "for a spherically symmetric mass distribution , the gravitational force on a mass @xmath35 at a distance @xmath47 from the center is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath60 is the total mass enclosed within the radius @xmath47 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ v2eq ] ) leads to the relation @xmath61 with @xmath62 in terms of the orbital period @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath63 this is the ` deformed ' version of kepler s third law .",
    ".the apparent and predicted violation of kepler s third law in planetary orbits . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "let us estimate how large this deformation can be for the planets in our solar system . using the data from ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the deformation factor @xmath53 for the planets setting @xmath8 equal to the upper bound provided in eq .",
    "( [ mercurylimit ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ planets ] .",
    "we also list the values of @xmath64 which show the apparent violation of kepler s third law .",
    "note that for elliptical orbits , the radius @xmath47 must be replaced by the semi - major axis @xmath65 .",
    "( we have not included mercury or pluto in our list since the eccentricities of these planets are rather large and the circular orbit approximation is poor . )    as can be seen from table  [ planets ] , the expected size of the deviation due to our deformed dynamics is orders of magnitude below the apparent deviation which can be explained by classical newtonian dynamics as a result of perturbations of the planets on each other . even in the case of jupiter ,",
    "for which the predicted deviation is the largest , the deviation due to the deformation is an order of magnitude smaller than the apparent deviation .    therefore , we can conclude that as long as the constraint given in eq .",
    "( [ mercurylimit ] ) is fulfilled , any deformation of kepler s third law due to non - zero @xmath8 is completely hidden under apparent violations due to more conventional effects .",
    "the deformation of kepler s third law will affect the @xmath47-dependence of @xmath56 .",
    "so let us consider whether our deformed dynamics could provide a non - dark matter solution to the halo dark matter problem .",
    "the halo dark matter problem pertains to the rotation curves of interstellar gas in spiral galaxies . `",
    "rotation curve ' refers to the plot of @xmath56 as a function of the distance @xmath47 from the galactic center .",
    "if gravity due to the visible stars is the only force responsible for the centripetal acceleration , then the observed distribution of stars and kepler s third law tell us that @xmath56 should fall off asymptotically as @xmath66 as @xmath47 is increased .",
    "however , the actual observed rotation curves approach constant values instead , suggesting the existence of dark matter halos to account for the missing mass @xcite .    in our deformed dynamics",
    ", the correction term @xmath53 does increase the value of @xmath56 for a given mass distribution .",
    "unfortunately , the deformation parameter @xmath67 itself falls off as @xmath66 with @xmath47 , so the correction vanishes for large @xmath47 and can not explain the plateau of the rotation curves .",
    "what our formalism does predict , however , is that the size of the correction will be different for different masses due to the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath54 : larger masses will rotate at higher speeds at the same radius @xmath47 , in clear violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "curiously , it has been recently observed that the rotation curves of stars and interstellar gas do not in general agree when measured separately @xcite .",
    "could our ` deformed ' dynamics account for this difference ? for most galaxies",
    "it turns out that the gas rotates at higher speeds than the massive stars .",
    "this may have a natural explanation by positing that the gas interacts differently with the dark matter and magnetic fields as compared to the stars .",
    "however , for two exceptional galaxies reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stars are rotating at much higher speeds than the gas .",
    "for the galaxy ngc7331 , the speeds of the stars and gas at distance @xmath68 from the center of the galaxy ( @xmath69 is the radius which encloses half of the visible light from the galaxy ) are reported to be @xmath70 if we interpret this galaxy as a case where the mechanisms that would normally accelerate the gas over the stars are absent and the effect of ` deformed ' dynamics is manifest , we can ask what value of @xmath8 would account for this difference . since @xmath71 then @xmath72 where we have neglected the correction term for the gas . if we assume the solar mass @xmath73 as a typical mass of a star in this galaxy , we find @xmath74 which is well within the limit given by eq .",
    "( [ mercurylimit ] ) and thus compatible with observations on the scale of the solar system .",
    "in this note , we have investigated possible observable consequences of the `` deformed '' kepler s third law as implied by the classical limit of the `` stringy '' commutation relations , eq .",
    "( [ stringy ] ) , which were in turn based on the minimal length uncertainty relation of perturbative string theory @xcite .    due to the stringent limit on @xmath8 ,",
    "( [ mercurylimit ] ) , obtained from the precession of the perihelion of mercury in a previous publication @xcite , the predicted sizes of the deviations for the planets are too small to be observed .",
    "however , the effect of the deformation can be amplified at galactic scales due to the large momenta involved and lead to significant changes in the rotation curves of stars in spiral galaxies .",
    "it would be interesting to contrast our deformed classical mechanics with another modification of newton s theory , mond ( modified newtonian dynamics )  @xcite , which apparently succeeds in predicting a flat rotation curve by modifying newton s second law to @xmath75 at very small accelerations ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "our deformed dynamics predicts different rotation curves for different masses , so it is apparently quite different from mond which does not violate the equivalence principle .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to ask whether there exists a deformation of the usual hamiltonian dynamics which incorporates some kind of uv / ir relation and is in the same universality class as mond .",
    "we hope to address this question in the future .",
    "we would like to thank vishnu jejjala , achim kempf , yukinori nagatani , makoto sakamoto , hidenori sonoda , and joseph slawny for helpful discussions , and alan chamberlin for his help with the planetary data .",
