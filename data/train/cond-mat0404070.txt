    ", has become one of the most actively studied topics of condensed matter physics today . since the discovery of its superconductivity ,  @xcite the layered ruthenate  has generated extensive research activities .",
    "@xcite what make  special among many unconventional superconductors are the availabilities of detailed knowledge of its fermi - liquid properties , as well as of ultra - high - purity single crystals with the residual resistivity less than 100 n@xmath9 cm .",
    "@xcite in particular , its fermi surface is relatively simple and consists of three nearly - cylindrical sheets of @xmath5- , @xmath6- , and @xmath4-bands with specific _",
    "d_-electron orbital characters .",
    "fermi - surface parameters of all three sheets , reflecting strong electron correlations , are experimentally quantified in detail .",
    "@xcite therefore , there is a prospect of the underlying physics of its unconventional superconductivity be understood in unprecedented detail and depth .",
    "obviously , the determination of the symmetry and anisotropic structure of the order parameter , the superconducting gap , is a crucial step toward identification of its pairing mechanism .",
    "the superconductivity of  has pronounced unconventional features such as : the invariance of the spin susceptibility across its superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature @xmath8 ,  @xcite appearance of spontaneous internal field ,  @xcite evidence for two - component order parameter from field distribution in the vortex lattice ,  @xcite absence of a hebel - slichter peak ,  @xcite and the strong dependence of @xmath8 on nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite these features are coherently understood in terms of spin - triplet _ p_-wave superconductivity with the vector order parameter being @xmath10 ,  @xcite in contrast to the spin - singlet _ d_-wave pairing known in high @xmath8 cuprates .",
    "this order parameter represents the paired spin state with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the orbital wave function with @xmath13 , called the chiral _",
    "p_-wave state .",
    "the above simple vector order parameter leads to the gap @xmath14 , which is isotropic because of the quasi - two dimensionality of the fermi surface .",
    "exponential temperature dependence of quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations is expected in this case .    however , a number of experimental results with very high quality crystals revealed the power - law temperature dependence of qp excitations . in particular , the specific heat  @xcite @xmath15 , the thermal conductivity  @xcite @xmath16 and nqr relaxation rate  @xcite @xmath17 , in addition to the ultrasonic attenuation rate  @xcite @xmath5 and variation of the penetration depth  @xcite @xmath18 , all indicated the presence of the lines of nodes , of zeros , or of gap minima in the superconducting gap .",
    "nevertheless , magnetothermal conductivity measurements for determination of the sc gap structure , with the applied field rotated within the  plane down to 0.35 k , have indicated little anisotropy within the planes .",
    "@xcite in spite of a number of detailed studies of the sc gap structure , the wave function of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 are thus still controversial .",
    "the main outstanding issues on the unconventional superconductivity of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 at present may be summarized as follows  @xcite : ( 1 ) full characterization of the sc gap structure ( i.e. orbital state ) in all bands , ( 2 ) direct observation of odd parity of the orbital state by a phase - sensitive method ( 3 ) clarification of the details of the spin state in the spin - triplet pairing state especially under magnetic fields , ( 4 ) confirmation of the  chirality \" due to time reversal symmetry breaking in the sc state and searches for novel phenomena associated with chirality , and ( 5 ) understanding of the multi - phase superconducting phases and the critical field limiting .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the assignment of the dominant band in producing the superconductivity by taking the orbital dependent superconductivity ( ods ) into account  @xcite , as well as the examination of the role of the incommensurate af fluctuation to pairing in the triplet channel , is crucial for the determination of the pairing mechanism .",
    "we report in this paper a new development to resolve the issue ( 1 ) .",
    "measurements of the spectra of qps induced by magnetic fields serve as a powerful approach for this purpose .",
    "the field - orientation dependent specific heat is a direct measure of the qp density of states ( dos ) and thus a powerful probe of the sc gap structure .",
    "@xcite indeed , in our previous report , we revealed the emergence of in - plane anisotropy below about 0.3 k in the sc gap of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 from the field - orientation dependence of the specific heat .",
    "@xcite we identified the multi - gap superconductivity with the active band @xmath4 , which has a modulated sc gap with a minimum along the [ 100 ] direction .    in the present study , we extended the measurements of the field - orientation dependence of the specific heat to the field direction covering all polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "we also found the scaling of electronic specific heat in magnetic fields perpendicular to the  plane . as a result",
    ", we have determined the superconducting gap structure of the spin - triplet superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in all bands for the first time .",
    "we will examine and select the pertinent theoretical models compatible with the present observation and discuss the effective pairing interaction as well as the roles of the incommensurate af fluctuation in @xmath5- and @xmath6-bands .",
    "single crystals of  were grown by a floating - zone method in an infrared image furnace .",
    "@xcite after specific - heat measurements on two crystals , the sample with @xmath19 k , close to the estimated value for impurity and defect free specimen ( @xmath20 k ) ,  @xcite was chosen for detailed study .",

    "an x - ray rocking curve of the sample shows the characteristics of a single crystal of high quality ; the diffraction peak width [ full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ] was comparable to that of a si crystal ( with fwhm of @xmath25 ) in our diffractometer .",
    "the directions of the tetragonal crystallographic axes of the sample were determined by x - ray laue pictures .",
    "the side of the crystal was intentionally misaligned from the [ 110 ] axis by @xmath26 .",
    "the field - orientation dependence of the specific heat was measured by a relaxation method with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the details of the measurement system , consisting of two orthogonally - arranged sc magnets and a mechanical rotating stage for the dewar , are described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite in the present study , we mainly operate the system with constant polar angle @xmath3 and varing azimuthal angle @xmath2 with a misalignment @xmath27 no greater than @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to maintain a constant @xmath3 during this conical variation of the field direction , because the large @xmath29 anisotropy in @xmath3 .",
    "the in - plane and inter - plane field alignment relative to the crystallographic axis was carried out , based on the known in - plane anisotropy of @xmath29 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite for referring to the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the crystallographic axes , we shall introduce the polar angle @xmath3 , for which @xmath30 corresponds to the [ 001 ] direction , and the azimuthal angle @xmath2 , for which @xmath31 with @xmath32 corresponds to the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "it is to be noted that the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal structure is known to conserve down to temperatures as low as 110 mk .",

    "are expected to be significantly different and the normalized dos of those bands are @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the plateau on the field dependence of @xmath35 at low temperature divides @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) reasonably into @xmath140 recovered at low field and @xmath141 recovered at high field .",
    "consequently we conclude that the active band which retains strong superconductivity up to high field is the @xmath4-band mainly derived from the in - plane @xmath142 orbital of ru @xmath143 electrons .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the qp energy spectrum is affected by the doppler shift in the mixed state for the superfluid velocity around the vortices , and consequently this energy shift gives rise to a finite dos at the fermi level where the local energy gap becomes smaller than the amplitude of the doppler shift .",
    "@xcite since the superfluid velocity @xmath63 is perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath144 , the doppler shift @xmath72 becomes zero for @xmath145 .",
    "thus the generation of qps by magnetic fields at nodes or at gap minima is suppressed for @xmath146 node or gap minima directions , and @xmath35 takes minima for these directions .  @xcite    figure  [ fig : pre](b ) shows the field - orientation dependence of @xmath35 for @xmath130-plane at @xmath125 k. the absence of a 2-fold oscillatory component in the raw data at @xmath32 guarantees that the in - plane field alignment is accurate during the azimuthal - angle @xmath2 rotation . for the field range @xmath147",
    "t @xmath148 t , where the qps in the active band @xmath4 are the dominant source of in - plane anisotropy of @xmath149 , a _",
    "non - sinusoidal _ 4-fold angular variation approximated as @xmath150 with @xmath151 is observed .",
    "since we observe ( i ) no angular variation above @xmath29 in the normal state and ( ii ) a 4-fold angular variation with the phase inverse to that due to the in - plane @xmath29 anisotropy below @xmath29 in the sc state , we conclude that the 4-fold oscillations at low temperature originate from the anisotropy in the sc gap .",
    "@xcite in addition , cusp - like features at the minima ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 : integer ) are attributable to the strong reduction of qp excitations for the nodal direction parallel to @xmath144 since the doppler shift becomes @xmath154 for a purely two - dimensional gap structure .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , strong @xmath7 dependence of the gap function would enhance the qp excitations even for the nodal direction parallel to @xmath144 , so that the cusp - like features would have been strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , in the active band @xmath4 , the gap structure with vertical line nodes or gap minima along the [ 100 ] directions are promising .",
    "in addition , from the consistency with observed value of @xmath155 , which mainly originates from the active band @xmath4 , we can deduce the order parameter @xmath156 with gap minima for the active band .",

    "[ fig : pre](c ) . while the previous experimental study  @xcite has resolved the directions of gap minima in the active band @xmath4 ,",
