    "the physics is very different for graphene bilayers that are stacked in the bernal geometry with the  a \" sublattice of one layer eclipsed with the  b \" sublattice of its neighbor ( @xmath1 stacking ) . here",
    "the effects of coherent interlayer coupling are quite strong and the low energy sector is described instead by a _ different _ class layer - coherent chiral fermions with a quadratic dispersion and a berry s phase of @xmath2 for reciprocal space orbits that encircle the point of degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this physics is readily understood from the experimentally known strength of the interlayer tunneling amplitude at eclipsed sites and it can be generalized to describe the low energy physics of multi - layer graphenes where the crystallographic axes of neighboring layers are rotated by special angles @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , experimental work over the last five years has revealed a family of multilayer graphenes that show only weak ( if any ) effects of their interlayer coupling .",
    "this family includes graphenes that are grown epitaxially on the @xmath4 surface @xcite , cvd grown graphenes @xcite and some forms of exfoliated graphene @xcite",
    ". a common structural attribute of these systems is a rotational misorientation ( a twist ) of their neighboring layers at angles of @xmath5 .",
    "the layer decoupling has been inferred from the measurements of the magnetotransport @xcite , of the landau level spectra observed in scanning tunneling spectroscopy @xcite and perhaps most clearly in angle - resolved photoemission spectra @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations are attracting significant theoretical attention .",
    "the layer decoupling in twisted multilayers is frequently attributed to a kinematical effect whereby the layer projections of the zone corner crystal momenta are _ misaligned _ by the rotation , preventing momentum - conserving interlayer motion at sufficiently low energy @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the low energy theory is described by four separate valley- and layer- polarized dirac cones .",
    "these fermions are then re - coupled at a crossover energy scale where the individual dirac cones merge and hybridize thus changing the band topology @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of this theory predicts that the residual low energy effect of the twist is to reduce the fermi velocities by an angle dependent factor where the smallest velocities are expected for small rotation angles .",
    "these theoretical predictions have provided a taking off point for further investigations of this problem using a variety of methods ranging from microscopic atomistic calculations to continuum models designed to capture selected elements of the microscopic physics .",

    "one can consider the situation where the rotation is taken about a lattice site and the relative shift @xmath13 .",
    "a commensurate rotation occurs when a lattice translation of the unrotated layer @xmath14 spanned by its two primitive layer translations @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the mapping of an _ inequivalent _ translation @xmath17 ( in the same star ) are equal .",

    "complementary structures with large @xmath20 and @xmath23 correspond to small angular deviations from the @xmath24 rotated structure . since the combination of a @xmath24 degree rotation and a translation by a nearest neighbor bond vector is a symmetry operation of the honeycomb lattice , a commensurate rotation near @xmath24 can be regarded as the superposition of a small angle rotation and a nonprimitive translation . the primitive translations @xmath25 of a general @xmath26 commensuration supercell are @xmath27 with length @xmath28 .",
    "commensuration pairs at angles @xmath6 and @xmath29 are related .",

    "the unit cells of these structures have the same area but they have different sublattice symmetries .",
    "all commensurate rotations share this property : they occur in partners where the sum of the rotation angles is @xmath24 and their unit cells have the same area . the commensuration indices @xmath26 and @xmath32 of the partners are related @xmath33 eliminating common divisors by 3 from the result .",

    "1 demonstrates that the indices @xmath26 generally provide a more useful specification of the structure than the fault angle @xmath6 .",
    "indeed nearby rotation angles can have very different fault indices and therefore describe crystalline structures with vastly different periods and different physical properties .",

    "it is convenient to label the eclipsed sites at the origin as the @xmath47 sublattice , a nearest neighbor bond vector @xmath49 and its partner in the rotated layer @xmath50 .",
    "then the condition for a second coincident site on the @xmath48 sublattice is @xmath51 for some possible choice of @xmath52 in the set of lattice translations in the reference(rotated ) layers . since the @xmath53 s are both lattice translations , this requires integer @xmath54 solutions to @xmath55 which can be expressed @xmath56 and has integer solutions only when @xmath57 is divisible by @xmath58 .",
    "when this is statisfied the coincident sites occur at special high symmetry points in the cell @xmath59 ( with only one sign per structure ) and correspond to high symmetry positions along the diagonal of the rhombus shown in the right hand panel of figure 1 .",

    "the existence of this solution implies that these @xmath67 points are coincident in the extended zone after translations by @xmath83 and @xmath84 as illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 .    one can also ask about the possibility of commensurability for intervalley momentum transfer @xmath85 , namely @xmath86 following a similar line of analysis one finds a different set of commensurability conditions @xmath87 thus for example , @xmath88 , @xmath89 gives a rotation angle @xmath35 which has its first integer solution when @xmath90 , giving @xmath91 and @xmath92 . notice the asymmetry between the values of @xmath54 and @xmath93 : the scattering between inequivalent dirac cones requires _ different _ umklapp terms when indexed to the individual reciprocal lattices of the two layers .",
    "the indices would be reversed by considering @xmath94 couplings .",

    "in this situation eqn . 13 requires that @xmath104 which is impossible since the numerator is never divisible by 3 so that intervalley coupling is excluded . on the other hand , when @xmath105 and @xmath106 intravalley are excluded and @xmath107 which can be satisfied for integer @xmath108 by appropriate choice of integer @xmath109 so that intervalley coupling is allowed .",
    "these two possibilities are thus complementary and mutually exclusive : one or the other must occur if the rotation is commensurate . using the indexing rule eqn . 4",
    ", one can easily show that partner commensurations realize complementary commensuration conditions : one member admits only the intravalley interlayer coupling while the other allows only the analogous intervalley scattering .",
    "thus the valley structure of the interlayer couplings are specified by the sublattice exchange symmetry of the structure .",
    "early work on the electronic properties of twisted graphene bilayers recognized that small angle rotational faults are inevitably described by large period commensuration cells that make atomistic calculations impractical .",
    "instead it is useful to develop a long wavelength description that captures the effect of rotation on the low energy electronic structure .",
    "the essential physics in this treatment is the momentum offset of the dirac nodes produced by the rotation @xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "the starting point of the continuum theory is the long wavelength theory appropriate to _ single layer _ graphene .",
    "the effective mass theory for electrons in each valley introduces two dirac hamiltonians for their smoothly varying pseudo - spinor fields @xmath110 where the @xmath111 s are @xmath112 pauli matrices acting on the sublattice amplitudes .",
    "a small angle relative rotation of the crystallographic axes in the of the two layers offsets the crystal momenta of their closest dirac nodes by @xmath113 .",
    "this can be described by a pair of layer - polarized dirac hamiltonians parameterized by the momentum offset @xmath114 in the manner @xmath115 where @xmath116 because of the relative rotation of the two layers .",
    "electrons in neighboring layers are coupled by a @xmath6-dependent interlayer coupling amplitude projected into the pseudospin basis . for small angle rotations",
    "these interlayer amplitudes vary smoothly in real space and one can focus on their lowest fourier components . in the theory of lopes dos santos _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the offset momentum @xmath117 is not in the reciprocal lattice of the commensuration cell and these authors focus on the three momenta @xmath118 that leave the offset @xmath119 invariant .",
    "these momenta can be expressed in terms of the offset @xmath120 : in complex notation they are @xmath121 . in the pseudospin basis , the interlayer coupling for each of these momentum transfers is characterized by a @xmath122 matrix - valued tunneling coefficient @xmath123 whose elements have been estimated numerically using a tight binding model .",
    "this yields in the small angle limit @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , approximately independent of the supercell period .",
    "the asymmetry in the set of selected @xmath128 s appearing in eqn .",
    "18 occurs because of the choice of the reference valley for the long wavelength expansion .",
    "nevertheless , this approach explicitly preserves the threefold rotational symmetry of the commensuration cell .",
    "this is seen most clearly by observing that the @xmath129 matrices are off diagonal operators in the layer degree of freedom and one may therefore arbitrarily  shift \" the interlayer coupling momenta by a layer - dependent @xmath130 gauge transformation .",
    "in particular the gauge shift @xmath131 in the rotated layer brings the two dirac nodes into coincidence and shifts the three momentum transfers so that they form the three arms of a star generated by @xmath132 and its @xmath133-rotated partners .",
    "the negates of these three momenta occur in the reciprocal amplitudes describing the reverse tunneling processes .",
    "thus the expansion about a _",
    "zone corner point preserves the full three fold symmetry of the commensuration cell , as required    the essential features of this theory are ( 1 ) the existence of a crystal momentum offset due to the rotational fault , ( 2 ) the coupling of plane wave states in one layer to a triad of plane wave states in its neighbor and ( 3 ) the existence of a @xmath134 term in the effective interlayer tunneling hamiltonian . feature ( 1 )",
    "suggests that at sufficiently low energy the effect of the interlayer coupling can be treated perturbatively in the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath135 .",
    "feature ( 2 ) implies the perturbative effects of this coupling _ vanish by symmetry _ precisely at @xmath136 so that the coupled system preserves the dirac nodes of its two ( decoupled ) layers .",
    "perturbative effects of the coupling arise at linear order in the momentum differences @xmath137 and can be interpreted as a twist dependent renormalization of the fermi velocity @xmath138 equation 19 needs to be applied with care since it breaks down both in the limit of small rotation angles due to a failure of the perturbation theory when @xmath139 and at large rotation angles when commensuration effects , neglected in this treatment , can intervene .",
    "finally , feature ( 3 ) indicates that electron states in the two layers that have the _ same _ crystal momentum modulo @xmath128 are coupled through the interlayer hamiltonian . in the low energy theory",
    "the layer - polarized dirac cones degenerate in the planes that bisect lines connecting their nodes ( above the crossover energy @xmath140 ) and one expects the strongest interlayer mixing to occur in these planes .",
    "there are three such planes that bisect the lines along @xmath141 and its @xmath133 rotated counterparts .",
    "the onset of this mixing is associated with a change of topology of the bilayer bands , connecting a low energy sector with layer - decoupled dirac cones to higher energy layer - coherent hyperbolic bands . in the lowest band",
    "this transition is associated with a saddle point in the electronic spectrum and a logarithmic van hove singularity in the two dimensional density of states @xcite .",
    "the novel physics of rotationally - induced layer decoupling has stimulated theoretical work by several groups to explore this effect using various atomistic models .",
    "ab initio calculations have been carried out for misaligned bilayer supercells containing up to @xmath142 atoms ( @xmath143 ) while tight binding methods have allowed workers to access larger systems of up to @xmath144 atoms @xcite .",
    "these studies have examined the fermi velocity renormalization , the form of the low energy electronic spectrum near the @xmath67 points and the spatial modulation of the electronic charge density .",
    "much of the ab - initio work has understandably focused on the shortest period twisted structures , e.g. @xmath145 and @xmath146 commensurations @xcite .",
    "calculations on these systems generally confirm a suppression of the interlayer coupling scale and a fermi velocity near the @xmath67 point which is essentially indistinguishable from that of single layer graphene .",
    "the most thorough investigation of the fermi velocity renormalization has been given by de laissardi@xmath147re _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who suggest that the rotational faults are characterized by three different velocity renormalization regimes , determined by the fault angle : ( a ) @xmath148 where the fermi velocity is essentially the same as for single layer graphene , ( b ) @xmath149 where a downward renormalization is found , well described by the perturbation theory of @xcite , and a low angle regime @xmath150 where the low energy bands are flattened and not described by the perturbative treatment .",
    "the small renormalization in the large fault angle regime ( a ) is at least qualitatively consistent with the continuum theory since the renormalization occurs via a virtual mixing of low energy states with states separated by an energy barrier @xmath151 .",
    "the breakdown of the perturbation theory for sufficiently small angle faults is similarly understandable since it involves an expansion in @xmath152 .",
    "surprisingly , in this low angle regime de laissardi@xmath147re _ et al .",

    "significantly , close to the zone corners the electronic bands are _ not _ linear but instead they are mixed , which requires an interlayer mass operator in the low energy hamiltonian .",
    "interestingly the spectral structure , and therefore the matrix structure of this mass term , is _ different _ for partner commensurations and therefore it can not be determined solely by the size of the commensuration cell .",
    "the scale of the mixing is nevertheless small relative to its value for bernal bilayers , e.g. the mixing scale for the @xmath155 structure is @xmath156 compared to @xmath157 for bernal stacking @xcite .",
    "further , over the range of structures they studied this mass scale appears to a rapidly decreasing function of the commensuration cell period .",
    "but the existence of this mass matrix in the low energy theory presents a significant challenge to the interpretation of the electronic states even at energies _ above _ the mass scale .",
    "notably , in order to match smoothly to these low energy eigenstates the bilayer eigenstates at higher energy must be ( nearly ) _ equal weight _ states coherently mixed between the two layers instead of the layer - polarized eigenstates that one would infer from the momentum space structure of the continuum theory .",

    "the former turn out to be most important for large angle faults while the latter are critical to the physics at small rotation angles .",
    "the new models are also formulated as continuum theories in order to circumvent the technical difficulty posed by fully microscopic atomistic treatments of large commensuration cells .",
    "concurrently there has been an effort to distill the original continuum model to a simpler effective two band model @xcite in an effort to explore the effects of the novel band topology on the orbital quantization of its electronic states in a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "we refer to all these new models as  second generation \" continuum theories .",

    "the ratio of the amplitudes for the indirect and direct couplings is approximately @xmath176 so that the indirect term is generally weaker than the direct term .      as discussed in section 2.2 either @xmath177 or @xmath178 couplings",

    "the @xmath200 term describes the crystal momentum - conserving interlayer couplings discussed in the theory of lopes dos santos _ et al .",
    "in addition there are umklapp terms involving @xmath201 terms that express the symmetry allowed couplings between dirac nodes @xmath202 .",
    "the geometrical considerations of section 2.2 require that for any given commensuration there are couplings within two distinct pairs of dirac nodes at the corners of their respective brillouin zones . in the bloch basis",
    "these matrix elements are spanned by a @xmath203 matrix of finite momentum scattering amplitudes @xmath204 which , using the threefold rotational symmetry , takes the form @xmath205 here @xmath206 describes the scattering amplitude for a momentum transfer @xmath207 coupling the two layers while @xmath208 and @xmath209 describe scattering amplitudes with larger momentum transfers @xmath210 . by projecting eqn .",
    "28 onto the sublattice ( pseudospin ) basis , one obtains the @xmath122 interlayer mass matrices @xmath211 that couple the dirac fermions of the two layers .",
    "the low energy hamiltonian for an even bilayer is thus expressed as a @xmath212 matrix ( acting on the two sublattice and two layer degrees of freedom ) @xmath213 while for the odd bilayer @xmath214 where @xmath215 are pauli matrices acting in the sublattice pseudospin basis of the @xmath216 layer and @xmath217 is the renormalized fermi velocity .",
    "note that for even parity faults the bilayer hamiltonian couples nodes of the same chirality , whereas the odd parity faults introduce coupling between nodes of compensating chirality . in either case the spectrum for coupled system retains a two - valley character due to the two ways of matching nodes in either family of structures .",
    "the interlayer mass matrices @xmath218 are @xmath219 eqns .",
    "29 and 31 show that for sublattice  even \" faults the mass term involves an @xmath220 rotation of its pseudospin through angle @xmath221 .",
    "this angle can not be identified with the rotation angle @xmath6 but it results instead from the interference of the three complex scattering amplitudes @xmath222 .",
    "by contrast in eqns .",
    "30 and 31 one finds that interlayer motion across an  odd \" fault is mediated by the amplitude on its dominant eclipsed sublattice . in both mass matrices the overall phase of the operator @xmath223 can be removed by a gauge transformation .",
    "31 describes a coupling between dirac waves in the neighboring layers that persists in the long wavelength @xmath224 limit , qualitatively changing the structure of the low energy spectra .",
    "their effects are illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "for sublattice odd parity faults one pair of coupled bands are gapped on the interaction scale @xmath225 leaving an @xmath136 contact point between a second pair of quadratically dispersing bands . for the even parity structures the @xmath226 spectrum contains a pair of coherence - split doublets .",
    "these two doublets are the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the original single layer dirac modes ; interestingly the layer - coupled states are topologically required to retain their dirac character for small @xmath227 , and disperse linearly away from the points of degeneracy . at finite momentum",
    "two branches undergo an avoided crossing which gaps the spectrum at its charge neutrality points .",
    "thus these structures are generically _ fully gapped _ where the size of the gap is determined by the pseudospin rotation angle @xmath221 in eqn .",
    "31 which allows these branches to hybridize .",
    "this gap degenerates to zero for the special case of an @xmath22 stacked structure where @xmath228 by symmetry . in both cases",

    "are compared with the spectra for the parent bernal ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath22 stacked structures .",
    "all odd parity structures , as shown on the left , contain a pair of coherence split massive bands and a contact point between two quadratic bands at @xmath136 .",
    "the even parity structures , shown on the right , feature a bonding / antibonding splitting , with a fully developed gap near the charge neutrality point which degenerates to a gapless state for the @xmath22 stacked structure . adapted from reference @xcite . ,",
    "width=302 ]    both these behaviors have precise analogs for the limiting cases of bernal and @xmath22 stacked bilayers which can be understood as the primitive parent structures of these two families . as shown in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "5 the bernal spectra exhibit the mass structure expected for all sublattice exchange odd faults , though on an inflated energy scale ( @xmath230 ) reflecting the full alignment of all sites on a single sublattice . similarly the primitive @xmath22 stacking features a coherence splitting of its bonding and antibonding layer - coupled states , but without the pseudospin rotation @xmath221 so that the spectrum remains gapless and the zero energy states occur on a ring in reciprocal space .      for small rotation angle the offset momentum @xmath139 and perturbation theory in the dimensionless parameter @xmath152 fails .",
    "the breakdown of the perturbation theory occurs because of an incomplete treatment of multiple scattering processes involving the interlayer coupling operator . recognizing this , bistritzer and macdonald ( bm ) @xcite developed a theory that treats multiple scattering through the three fundamental interlayer amplitudes that describe a spatially modulated interlayer coupling with the period of the commensuration supercell .",
    "their results show that the fermi velocity renormalization of the perturbation theory presages more dramatic physics at small rotation angle which can be described as  velocity reversal , \" i.e. the fermi velocity changes _ sign _ as a function of ( small ) rotation angle crossing through zero at a series of discrete magic angles . as a consequence",
    "the small angle regime is predicted to feature a manifold of nearly flat bands at low energy .",
    "the bm model is formulated as a two layer scattering theory : states with momentum @xmath167 in one layer are scattered into states at momentum @xmath231 in its neighbor . in the pseudospin basis",
    "the amplitudes for these processes are the @xmath232 matrices given in eqn .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath233 on the rotated layer brings two dirac nodes of neighboring layers into coincidence , and in this momentum shifted basis the three momentum transfers @xmath234 are @xmath235 and two @xmath133-rotated partners @xmath236 which form a threefold symmetric triad .",
    "thus this construction considers a twofold layer - degenerate dirac cone whose states are coupled through an off - diagonal nonlocal operator containing three possible momentum transfers @xmath237 in the interlayer hopping . in the long distance theory",
    "the single layer hamiltonians are isotropic , so for _ arbitrary _ rotation angle @xmath6 the the theory is specified by its unrenormalized fermi velocity , the rotation angle and the coupling strength labelled @xmath238 in bm @xcite , which combine to form a single dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath239 .",
    "repeated action of the nonlocal interlayer operator generates a lattice of coupled momenta as shown in the top panel of figure 6 .",
    "the interlayer tunneling amplitudes are _ directed transitions _ in reciprocal space : the momenta @xmath240 and their negates @xmath241 describe complementary processes that transport electrons to and from the rotated layer .",
    "consequently , an even number of applications of the nonlocal operator to an initial single - layer bloch state at wavevector @xmath167 generates a bloch state in the same layer with momentum @xmath242 where @xmath243 is spanned by the primitive vectors @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",

    "an even number of applications of the operator generates a triangular lattice of momenta in the original layer ( red ) , an odd number generates a triangular lattice offset by momentum @xmath141 ( black ) .",

    "bottom panel : band structures obtained by numerical diagonalization of the continuum hamiltonian in a truncated plane wave basis retaining kinetic energies of order the coupling strength @xmath238 .",
    "the bands are plotted along the momentum space trajectory @xmath250 in the top figure .",
    "for small rotation angles the bands flatten and the fermi velocity of the zero energy states is strongly suppressed . adapted from reference @xcite.,width=302 ]    bm studied this model by numerically diagonalizing a truncated hamiltonian expanded in a plane wave basis and retaining plane waves with kinetic energies below the coherence scale @xmath251 .",
    "the effects of multiple scattering through the interlayer coupling terms is then encoded in the structure of the bilayer eigenstates which contain coherent superpositions of the single - layer dirac modes . for large rotation angles ( @xmath252 )",
    "the model reproduces the perturbation theory of lopes dos santos et al .",
    "by contrast , in the very small angle regime the bandwidth @xmath253 collapses , the number of elements in the low energy basis grows correspondingly and the electronic structure becomes spectrally congested as illustrated in fig . 6 .",
    "thus the small angle regime is described by a strong coupled _ multiband _ theory that introduces physics inaccessible to a low order perturbation theory .",
    "bm find that the low energy spectra in this regime show a very substantial reduction of the fermi velocity ( typically @xmath254 of its single layer value ) due to level repulsion among the coupled bands .",
    "remarkably , the reduced velocity parameter _ oscillates _ as a function of the fault angle as shown in figure 7 and crosses zero at a series of magic rotation angles .",
    "they suggest that this oscillation likely results from a @xmath6 dependence of the superpositions of single layer modes that contain velocities of opposite sign , though a complete theory of the velocity oscillations has yet to be developed .",
    "thus the velocity renormalization found in the weak coupling limit represents just the first step towards a complete twist - induced reconstruction of the low energy spectrum !",
    "there has been interest in distilling the continuum theory to a simpler effective _ two band _ model that captures the topological structure of its low energy spectrum .",
    "the approach is similar in spirit to the theory of bernal stacked bilayers @xcite where one can integrate out its high energy degree of freedom to arrive at an effective theory for its low energy states . for the bernal bilayer",
    "this procedure identifies a new class of layer - coherent chiral fermions that have quadratic low energy dispersion and a berry s phase of @xmath2 . for the twisted bilayer , neglecting commensuration effects , the low energy spectrum contains two layer - polarized _ linear _ dirac cones that are recoupled at an energy scale @xmath255 where they merge .",
    "the two band model attempts to provide a compact description of the topological transition of the band dispersion that connects the low energy  doubled cone \" sector to its high energy layer - hybridized sector .    for twisted bilayers the two band construction",
    "can be understood as a variant of the low energy theory for a bernal bilayer that allows for a finite momentum offset @xmath256 between its dirac nodes .",
    "thus the low energy theory for bernal stacking is modified in the manner @xmath257 valid for very small fault angles where @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "this expression can be derived by replacing the interlayer operators of eqn .",
    "18 by a simpler expression @xmath260 which physically describes an interlayer tunneling amplitude across a single sublattice in each layer .",
    "the spectrum of this hamiltonian features a pair of dirac cones , split by the momentum offset @xmath256 , that merge at a two dimensional saddle point at @xmath226 representing the topological transition of the band structure .",
    "importantly , the single layer dirac cones in this model have the _ same _ chirality so that annihilation of the dirac points when they are coupled is topologically forbidden . generically",
    ", this model does allow for an energy offset between the dirac points of the coupled bilayer but this is believed to be small for physically reasonable coupling strengths .",
    "the hamiltonian in eqn .",
    "32 has been used to study the orbital quantization of a twisted bilayer in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field . by construction",
    "the limit @xmath261 describes the landau quantization of bernal bilayer graphene : a berry s phase of @xmath2 and quantized energy levels @xmath262 .",
    "by contrast for finite rotation angles the low energy spectrum of the offset model is a  doubled \" theory of single layer graphene : the fourfold degeneracy due to the spin and valley degrees of freedom is doubled by an approximate layer decoupling of its low energy eigenstates .",
    "an asymptotic analysis of the eigenvalues within this model demonstrates that splittings of the landau level degeneracies due to interlayer coupling are exponentially suppressed as a function of the rotation angle in the low energy regime @xcite .",
    "the spectrum thus features a zero mode and landau levels that disperse @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "this twofold layer degeneracy is quickly eliminated as one passes through the crossover energy @xmath140 where the dirac cones merge and hybridize . above this",
    "crossover the spectrum has a different character : layer degeneracies are removed and the quantized energies are @xmath264 as expected for a parabolic interlayer coherent band .",
    "rotational faults commonly occur in a several different forms of graphene and their electronic properties are actively studied experimentally .",
    "the rapidly growing experimental literature on this subject has not yet provided a unified picture of the effects of faults on the electronic behavior , possibly due to differences in the electronic properties of samples produced by different experimental methods .",
    "a significant point of _ agreement _ among the various experimental works is that the interlayer coherence scale is very small in these systems @xcite .",
    "this can be deduced clearly from their landau level spectra which have been measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) .",
    "these spectra show a scaling of the landau level energies @xmath265 @xcite the signature of the landau quantization of a massless dirac band , as observed for single layer graphene and quite distinct from the level sequence observed for bernal stacked bilayers @xcite .",
    "perhaps the strongest evidence for a reduction of the interlayer coupling scale comes from angle resolved photoemission experiments which directly measure the quasiparticle dispersion relation @xcite and find spectra that follow the expected form for an isolated dirac cone .",
    "these measurements have been interpreted as providing the first direct measurement of the dirac dispersion relation in graphene , uncontaminated by substrate or other interlayer effects @xcite .",
    "since the effects of the interlayer coupling in twisted multilayers are intrinsically weak , their study is posing a significant experimental challenge .",
    "it is here where different experiments carried out on different samples disagree .",
    "for example , the fermi velocity can be deduced from the slope of the @xmath266 scaling relation for the landau quantized energies .",
    "the strongest evidence for a twist - induced renormalization of @xmath153 comes from the landau level spectra measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy of cvd graphenes grown on ni substrates @xcite .",
    "this work reports that @xmath153 is not constant as a function of scanned position across a macroscopic sample , but instead it is found to vary in a range @xmath267 .",
    "simultaneous measurement of the topography of the moire superlattice period of these samples correlates the velocity reduction with the period and hence the rotation angle .",
    "the larger value , found for large angle rotations , agrees well with the @xmath153 for single layer graphene and the @xmath268 reduced value is correlated with a small angle rotation @xmath269 as suggested by a perturbative analysis of the continuum theory @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with analogous sts measurements carried out for multilayer graphenes grown epitaxially on sic @xmath270 .",
    "these also show the @xmath266 scaling of the landau quantized energies . however , for these materials the slope of the scaling relation yields a fermi velocity @xmath271 for all samples studied down to a rotation angle of @xmath272 @xcite completely spanning the range of rotation angles where a velocity renormalization is expected .",
    "a similar discrepancy arises in the spectroscopy of the van hove singularity presumed to occur in the region where the momentum - offset dirac cones of a twisted bilayer merge .",
    "low energy sts on ni / cvd grown graphene reveals low energy peaks whose energies disperse with their topographically measured rotation angles in the low angle regime @xmath273 @xcite roughly consistent with the van hove scenario .",
    "yet these features are not seen at all in spectroscopy of the sic epitaxial twisted graphenes regardless of the fault angle .",
    "perhaps the strongest challenge to the idea of a twist - induced spectral reconstruction comes from angle resolved photoemission .",
    "these measurements directly measure the quasiparticle dispersion and clearly resolve the dirac cone with a fermi velocity that is indistinguishable from that of single layer graphene . despite a careful search",
    ", no evidence is found in these measurements for any type of hybridization between dirac cones in the spectral regions where they cross @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the arpes data is that the first few graphene layers accessible to this spectroscopy are electronically floating , i.e. extremely weakly coupled to each other and to deeper layers in the film .",
    "an important goal for theory in this area is therefore to identify situations where the effects of the interlayer coupling across a rotational fault are manifested in their electronic behavior .",
    "there has been progress in this direction .",
    "bistritzer and macdonald have studied the effect of the rotation angle of a bilayer on its interlayer tunneling conductance , predicting dramatic enhancements of the vertical conductance at special rotation angles that can be identified with low order commensurate superlattices @xcite .",
    "more recent work has pointed to nontrivial effects of a @xmath6-dependent interlayer coupling on the equilibrium charge redistribution across the bilayer in a perpendicular field @xcite .",
    "kindermann and i studied the landau level spectra for weakly coupled bilayers and find that even a weak coherence splitting of bilayer bands at energies well above the mass scale produces a striking new effect , the dirac comb @xcite . here",
    "small differences in the orbitally quantized states in two weakly coherence - split bands produces an amplitude modulation of the landau level spectrum with a period that greatly exceeds the coherence scale , and should be observable by magnetotransport in the weak field regime .",
    "small rotations angles can introduce long spatial moire periods for twisted bilayers that can be made commensurate with the magnetic length @xmath274 on accessible field scales , accessing hofstadter commensuration physics in a new family of materials @xcite .",
    "the band flattening theoretically predicted for in the small twist angle regime will surely focus attention on many body effects in the low energy physics .",
    "further studies along all of these lines provide a very open area for further work .",
    "one might be discouraged by the lack of a definitive theory of the electronic structure of rotationally faulted graphenes . to the contrary",
    "this is an exciting situation .",
    "these systems are challenging to the most familiar tools of electronic structure theory and their understanding is likely to involve creative new approaches .",
