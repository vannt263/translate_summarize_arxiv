    "the receded horizon intersects the black - hole time - like singularity , leaving a sector of the singularity uncovered by an horizon , clashing with the cosmic censorship hypothesis which forbids naked singularities . on the other hand , we know that the singularity of a charged black hole is space - like : at the point the particle reaches the singularity ( point a ) the singularity flips from time - like to space like ,",
    "it is then entirely dressed by the the event horizon , the cosmic censorship hypothesis is spared .",
    "furthermore , a cauchy horizon @xmath8 is formed , closing the space - time diagram .",
    "such a topological change of a very massive black hole caused by say , a single infalling electron seems disturbing . on the other hand , if charge fluctuations of an otherwise uncharged black hole are always present , no black hole is ever truly uncharged ; these charge fluctuations prevent a topological swap . in order to address the issue",
    ", we resort to a controlled situation of an uncharged black hole in thermal equilibrium with a number @xmath9 species of gauge bosons and @xmath10 species of electrically charged fermion pairs . the black hole and",
    "the plasma reside inside a perfectly reflecting spherical cavity of coordinate radius @xmath11 ; the overall charge of the system , as well as the mean charge of the black - hole vanishes .",
    "we tacitly assume that black hole charge fluctuations are produced by fluctuations of the pair production process at the event horizon ( hawking radiation ) and the continuous absorption of particles by the black - hole .",
    "gauge bosons are required for consistency , as pairs of charged particles are continuously produced and annihilated within the plasma and one of the pair s member might be absorbed by the black hole , or otherwise , emitted by the hole and annihilated by some charge unbalance in the plasma .",
    "consider a black hole of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath12 in thermal equilibrium with a plasma consisting of @xmath9 gauge bosons and @xmath13 charged electron and positron pairs . the primordial quantity to assess the thermodynamical equilibrium is the total entropy : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the black hole , radiation and charged particles entropies .",
    "furthermore , the energy and charge conservation constraints must be fulfied : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the boson and fermion contributions to the the total energy , @xmath20 the charge of the fermions , taken identical for all species and @xmath21,@xmath22 the total number of positive and negative charged particles inside the cavity .    with the the appropriate number of particles per mode @xmath23 , we can calculate the total energy and the total number of particles : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the degeneracy of each species and @xmath26 , the spatial volume element of the time foliation .",
    "last , the black - hole entropy is given by bekenstein s formula  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , the charge conservation constraint reads @xmath29 while the energy condition reads @xmath30p^2 dp \\nonumber\\\\   \\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expressions @xmath31 with @xmath32 the mass of the fermions , taken identical for all species , @xmath11 is the coordinate radius of a spherical confining vessel and @xmath33 is the electrostatic energy for each positive and negative fermion .",
    "the number of particles per mode is : @xmath34 with @xmath35 here @xmath36 stands for the chemical potential in units of @xmath37 .",
    "equilibrium considerations require the first the entropy derivatives with respect to the control parameters to vanish .",
    "second derivatives provide information about stability and the amount of fluctuations .",
    "therefore all quantities should be calculated to order not larger than @xmath38 , if we are concerned with fluctuations around an uncharged configuration .",
    "thus , up to this order :      where we tacitely assumed that the chemical potential is also linear in @xmath12 , @xmath40 or equivalently @xmath41 . under these conditions , we can immediately solve the charge conservation constraint [ eq.([x ] ) ] : @xmath42 where we defined the spatial integrals @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 ; this definition of @xmath47 and the other functions that follow was conveniently chosen such that in the relativistic limit @xmath48 all these functions approach one . since eq.([mu ] ) does not depends on @xmath12 , our assumption that @xmath40 is completely justified .",
    "the energy constraint looks a bit more cumbersome @xmath49 \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined two new integrals @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "both integrals are to be evaluated for @xmath46 ; @xmath52 in the relativistic limit .",
    "the radiation entropy is obtained via the first law of thermodynamics ; the fermion s entropy can be calculated in this same manner , provided we implement the charge conservation constraint .",
    "it is less cumbersome , however to calculate this entropy from its definition :      as the standard procedure , we integrate the second term in this expression by parts and write for the total entropy @xmath54p^2dp\\ ] ] where we used the fact that @xmath55 . up to the second order in @xmath12 : @xmath56    where we defined two additional integrals @xmath57 with the same property that @xmath58 in the relativistic limit . to the leading term in @xmath12 ,",
    "the volume integral reads @xmath59\\ ] ] collecting all the terms , we can write the total energy and entropy in powers of @xmath60 too : @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63   i_2   \\label{s0}\\ ] ] are the zero order terms . the second order terms are        for a schwarzschild bh ( @xmath66 ) in equilibrium with the thermal bath of radiation and plasma the first and second derivatives of the total entropy with respect to @xmath0 produce the usual thermal equilibrium conditions for a schwzschild black hole with its radiation which was studied in detail by pavon and many others a long time ago  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the first derivative of the total entropy with respect to the charge vanishes identically as it should be : an uncharged black hole is an equilibrium configuration with its radiation .",
    "is is a stable configuration ?",
    "what is the size of the charge fluctuations ? in order to answer these questions we proceed with the calculation of the second derivative of the entropy . the charge conservation constraint was already solved .",
    "thus , the energy conservation constraint requires that : @xmath67    having in mind that @xmath68 , then @xmath69 and it follows that @xmath70 on similar grounds @xmath71 putting these pieces together @xmath72 where we defined @xmath73 having in mind the definitions of @xmath74 [ eq.([e0])]and @xmath75 [ eq.([s0 ] ) ] we have explicitly @xmath76 in the ultra relativistic limit , @xmath77 all the above functions in the definition of @xmath78 approach one while their derivatives vanish and , accordingly @xmath79 . in the opposite low temperature limit ,",
    "all these integrals vanish exponentially , and again @xmath79 .",
    "we plotted the graph of the function @xmath78 for one species of gauge bosons and one of charged particle / antiparticle fermion .",
    "@xmath84 \\left(3 i_2 -\\frac{r^3}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2m}{r } } } -mr_1\\right ) \\\\ -\\frac{3 \\hbar^3 \\beta^3}{4\\pi",

    "we checked numerically that all the combinations of the functions @xmath85 in the above expressions are positive definite .",
    "the function @xmath86 is positive definite while inspection of fig.([i3 ] )      reveals that @xmath87 is positive for @xmath88 , which curiously is very close to the last stable photon orbit @xcite .",
    "clearly we need to require that the confining vessel is larger than those unstable orbits , in which case this function is also positive .",
    "the three first terms contribute to the thermodynamical stability of the @xmath89 configuration , while the last two contribute to the instability .",
    "let us know consider a very large confining cavity @xmath90 , in which case @xmath91 @xmath92 and further taking the relativistic limit @xmath93 , we have for the charge fluctuations      we can identify @xmath95 as the thermodynamical charge fluctuations inside of the confining cavity , which must be identical to those of the black hole itself .",
    "interpretation of all the other terms remains elusive .",
    "for instance , the second term in the sum does not depend on the specific value of the charge of the charge carriers , neither does the last term which contributes for instability . recalling that @xmath96 , the ratio of the two linear terms in @xmath11 is of the order @xmath97 while the ratio of the two last terms is @xmath98 this means that for radii @xmath99 the second term controls the instability and is much more significant than the second term . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of the third term ( the one of thermodynamical origin ) with the forth term ( that controls the instability ) is of the order @xmath100 which tells that the for stability the cavity can not be larger than a few times the schwarzschild radius . under these conditions , the black hole is unstable under charge fluctuations .",
    "clearly , this discussion overlooks the the role of charge fluctuations at the walls of the cavity , which could eventually stabilize the system .",
    "as long as @xmath101 similar conclusion applies , as only the numerical coefficients in eq.([unstable ] ) change .",
    "accordingly , instability results for any black hole lighter than @xmath102 the first term in eq.([unstable ] ) is the most intriguing one : @xmath103 as it neither depends on the size of the confining cavity , nor on the number of species of particles , nor not even on the specific value of the charge of the charged particles .",
    "it is a genuine quantum mechanical property of the black hole . as a matter of fact",
    ", it arises from the second derivative of @xmath104 with respect to the charge .",
    "this contribution is bound to remain for a radiating black hole radiating isolated .",
    "note that this genuine quantum mechanical effect implies on a recession of the event horizon and the emergence of cauchy surface : @xmath105 furthermore , this intrinsic black hole contribution to its own charge fluctuation answers the question we posed in the introduction , no black hole is ever truly uncharged , it produces charge fluctuations that maintains the topology unchanged by the absorption of charged particles .",
    "the black hole entropy is such that the hole is protected against topological changes .    what is the fate of a large black hole ?",
    "if @xmath106 all the functions @xmath107 die away exponentially . therefore in the expression for the second derivative of the entropy [ eq .",
    "( [ sqq ] ) ] , the term which is proportional to @xmath108 is negative and diverges exponentially .",
    "therefore , the black hole becomes stable and the charge fluctuations become exponentially small .",
    "almost forty years ago , in an unnoticed paper bekenstein @xcite studied the mass fluctuations of schwarzschild black hole and concluded that the standard squared deviation of the black hole mass becomes negative for black holes of masses larger than @xmath109 .",
    "he called this the width paradox .",
    "black hole fluctuations has been overlooked over the years and they might lead us to new insights into the nature of quantum theory and gravity .",
    "i am thankful that my ways become intertwined with those of j. d. bekenstein z\"l .",
