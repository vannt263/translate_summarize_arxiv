    "many signals for new physics at hadron colliders involve an electroweak gauge boson ( @xmath6 ) and jets , one or more of which contain a heavy quark ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the prime example is the discovery of the top quark via the signal @xmath8 , where two of the jets contain @xmath1 quarks @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the backgrounds to these signals in as much detail as possible @xcite .",
    "we have recently completed a next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation of @xmath9 production in association with one or two jets , one ( or more ) of which contain a heavy quark @xcite . with one or more heavy quarks is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] in this paper we present a nlo calculation of @xmath0 production in association with two jets , one or more of which contain a @xmath1 quark .",
    "the case of @xmath0 production in association with one or more jets containing a charm quark is more complicated due to the additional contributions coming from @xmath10 .",
    "the production of a @xmath0 boson in association with two jets , one or more of which contain a heavy quark , is particularly interesting as it is the principal background to both single - top production @xcite and higgs production ( via @xmath11 ) @xcite , which are currently being sought at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "single - top production occurs via both a @xmath12-channel process , @xmath13 @xcite , and an @xmath14-channel process , @xmath15 @xcite . in both cases the final state , after top decay ,",
    "comprises a @xmath0 boson and two jets , one ( @xmath12-channel ) or both ( @xmath14-channel ) of which contain a @xmath1 quark . in the case of higgs production , the final state (",
    "after the decay @xmath16 ) comprises a @xmath0 and two jets , both of which contain a @xmath1 quark @xcite .",
    "however , even if both jets contain a @xmath1 quark , it is more efficient to tag only one of them @xcite .",
    "thus in all cases the principal background is @xmath0 plus two jets , one ( or more ) of which contain a heavy quark .",
    "the signals for single top @xcite and higgs @xcite are known at nlo and beyond ; our goal is to provide a calculation of the principal background at nlo .",
    "at leading order ( lo ) , there are two processes that produce a @xmath0 boson and two jets , at least one of which contains a @xmath1 quark .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wbb ] . the process",
    "@xmath17 yields two @xmath1 jets , and is already known at nlo @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the process @xmath18 yields just one @xmath1 jet . for a signal with just one @xmath1 tag , these two processes are comparable at the tevatron , while at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) the latter process is dominant @xcite .     + ( a ) ( b )    the process @xmath18 requires further consideration , as it contains a @xmath1 quark in the initial state .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution in the proton is derived perturbatively via the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may eschew a @xmath1 distribution function , and use a gluon in the initial state , which then splits to @xmath19 , with one @xmath1 participating in the hard scattering while the other remains at low transverse momentum ; this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbj ] @xcite .",
    "however , there are two advantages to working with a @xmath1 distribution function . first , initial - state collinear logarithms , of order @xmath20^n$ ] ,",
    "are summed to all orders , yielding a more convergent perturbative expansion .",
    "second , the lo process is simpler , which makes the nlo calculation tractable .",
    "a @xmath1 distribution function is useful when the scale of the process is much greater than the @xmath1 mass . in beauty production at hera",
    ", the scale is not much greater than the @xmath1 mass , and the appropriate description is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "thus there is no direct measurement of the @xmath1 distribution function at this time .",
    "single - top production ( @xmath12-channel ) may provide the first such measurement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : wbj ]",
    "we outline the nlo calculation and discuss some of the finer points .",
    "the issue of correctly treating the @xmath1-quark mass arises in a novel way , and we discuss this in some detail .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the lo cross sections for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , arising from the processes in figs .",
    "[ fig : wbb](b ) and [ fig : wbb](a ) , respectively , are given in parentheses in table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ] .",
    "all jets are required to have @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 at the tevatron , while at the lhc we require @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 .",
    "the jets are required to be separated by @xmath28 . as mentioned in the introduction , these cross sections are comparable at the tevatron , while @xmath22 is dominant at the lhc .",
    "this qualitative result is already well known from the lo calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which used a gluon in the initial state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbj ] ) rather than a @xmath1 quark [ fig .",
    "[ fig : wbb](b ) ] .",
    "our goal is to calculate these cross sections at nlo .",
    "the processes involved in the calculation are as follows :    * @xmath29 at tree level [ fig .",
    "[ fig : wbb](a ) ] and one loop * @xmath18 at tree level [ fig .",
    "[ fig : wbb](b ) ] and one loop * @xmath30 at tree level * @xmath31 at tree level * @xmath32 at tree level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbj ] ) * @xmath33 at tree level    in all cases @xmath34 , and we include cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing . the @xmath1-quark mass is neglected throughout ( except where noted ) .",
    "the calculation is simpler than the corresponding calculation for @xmath35 and @xmath36 because there are several subprocesses that have no contributing analogue , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the analogous processes , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , yield a top quark in the final state .",
    "we do not consider these , or any other processes that yield a top quark , as part of our calculation of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 backgrounds .",
    "the nlo calculations in this paper were performed with the monte - carlo code mcfm @xcite .",
    "the leading - order calculations were performed both with this code and with madevent @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections are included in the code mcfm by implementing the virtual helicity amplitudes of ref .",
    "these are given in the four - dimensional helicity scheme , which is used throughout the calculation .",
    "the strong coupling constant is shifted from this scheme to the @xmath41 scheme @xcite .",
    "the real corrections are adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite and singularities are handled using the dipole subtraction method  @xcite . since the matrix elements contain the decay of the gauge boson into massless particles , the code is general enough to provide results for final states from @xmath42 , including the correlation between the @xmath43 spin and the angular distribution of the leptons .",
    "for this paper we specialize to the case of an on - shell @xmath0 boson .",
    "the nlo cross sections are presented in table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ] . to obtain the nlo cross sections for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which involve the radiation of additional partons ,",
    "two partons are combined into a single jet by adding their four - momenta if @xmath44 .",
    "if the combined partons are both @xmath1 quarks , then the process contributes to the column labeled @xmath45 .",
    "this is a @xmath46 event in which one jet contains two @xmath1 quarks , which changes the tagging probability for that jet @xcite .",
    "it is calculated with a finite @xmath1-quark mass ( @xmath47 gev ) in order to regulate the logarithmic divergence present when the heavy quarks are collinear .",
    "if all three partons are well separated , then the process contributes to either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "there is another aspect of the calculation in which the @xmath1-quark mass can not be neglected .",
    "if the @xmath1 quark comes from a final - state virtual gluon splitting to @xmath19 , with the other @xmath1 quark missed , then the cross section is sensitive to the @xmath1-quark mass .",
    "this can occur in the nlo processes @xmath30 and @xmath32 , both of which contribute to @xmath22 when one @xmath1 quark is missed .",
    "we therefore calculated these processes with a finite @xmath1-quark mass .",
    "in the case of the process @xmath50 , which involves the splitting @xmath51 in the initial state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wbbj ] ) as well as the final state , this requires that we abandon the dipole subtraction method in favor of subtracting the mass singularity via the truncated @xmath1 distribution function @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 $ ] is the dglap splitting function .",
    "the counterterm is constructed by calculating @xmath54 ; this cancels the initial - state logarithmic dependence on the @xmath1-quark mass in @xmath32 , and yields a cross section in the @xmath41 factorization scheme .",
    "it is interesting to compare the lo result for @xmath22 with a calculation based on @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbj ] ) @xcite , which does not use a @xmath1 distribution function . with the same parameters as table  [ tab :",
    "wbj_exclusive ] , and using @xmath47 gev and cteq6l1 parton distribution functions @xcite , we find a cross section of 1.92 pb at the tevatron .",
    "this is to be compared with 1.06 pb using @xmath18 , and serves as a rough check of the formalism .",
    "both of these numbers are lo and very scale dependent , so one should expect only qualitative agreement .",
    "to @xmath56 , the cross sections are @xmath57 pb for @xmath55 and @xmath58 pb for @xmath18 ] the result at the lhc ( @xmath60 ) is 81 pb , which is to be compared with the 87.3 pb result obtained using @xmath61 ( see table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ] ) . in any case",
    ", the nlo results presented in this paper should be more accurate than any of these lo results .",
    "we checked that the effect of the heavy - quark mass is small if all @xmath1 quarks are at high @xmath62 by comparing @xmath23 at tree level with and without a finite quark mass . with the cuts used in this paper",
    ", we find a reduction of the @xmath23 cross section by about 7% at the tevatron ( @xmath63 gev ) and 2% at the lhc ( @xmath64 gev ) .",
    "this is the same as the result found for the effect of the @xmath1-quark mass on the full nlo calculation at the tevatron @xcite , which suggests that the effect of the @xmath1-quark mass can be divined from a lo calculation .",
    "we found that the heavy - quark mass is a similarly small effect for @xmath65 at tree level , as expected .",
    "we also list in table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ] the lo ( in parentheses ) and nlo cross sections for @xmath66 @xcite , and the lo cross section for @xmath67 .",
    "we ignore ckm mixing , which is a negligible effect at lo , and is therefore also negligible at nlo . in these cross sections",
    "we have included the contribution from light partons as well as heavy quarks ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , for example , the fraction of @xmath46 events in which only one of the jets can be tagged as @xmath1 jet is given by @xmath68/wjj$ ] .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ] are remarkable .",
    "first we see that , at nlo , the cross sections for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are comparable at the tevatron .",
    "thus both final states are important backgrounds to single top and higgs . at the lhc",
    ", @xmath22 is much larger than @xmath23 . at both machines ,",
    "the correction to @xmath22 is large ( for @xmath69 ) , about a factor of 1.9 at the lhc and a factor of 2.4 at the tevatron .",
    "the correction is larger at the tevatron because @xmath23 , which is comparable in size , feeds into the @xmath22 column at nlo when one of the @xmath1 quarks is outside the fiducial region ( @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 ) .",
    "the correction to @xmath23 is significant at both machines , but more modest than that of @xmath22 , again for @xmath69 . at the lhc",
    "the cross section for @xmath65 is comparable to that of @xmath23 , which calls into question the reliability of perturbation theory .",
    "however , @xmath65 is also a correction to @xmath22 , and when compared with that lo cross section it is a modest correction .",
    "nevertheless , it does mean that when demanding two @xmath1 quarks in the final state , the processes @xmath23 and @xmath65 are comparable at the lhc . the latter is only known at lo and therefore has a large uncertainty .",
    "this is reflected by the large scale dependence associated with this process , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    using the results in table  [ tab : wbj_exclusive ]",
    ", we construct a set of inclusive cross sections , presented in table  [ tab : wbj_inclusive ] . displayed this way , the radiative corrections to the cross sections are even more significant , especially for @xmath70 at the lhc , where the nlo cross section is about 2.7 times the lo cross section . however , the proper way to regard this is that a new process enters at nlo , namely @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbj ] ) , which is also a correction to the much larger lo process @xmath18 , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "we also list the uncertainties from varying the renormalization scale from @xmath72 to @xmath56 while keeping the factorization scale fixed at @xmath73 , from varying the factorization scale from @xmath72 to @xmath56 while keeping the renormalization scale fixed at @xmath73 , and from varying the parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the largest uncertainty is from varying the renormalization scale , since the process under consideration is of order @xmath74 at leading order .",

    "this supports our earlier argument that part of the source of the large nlo correction to this process is that the process @xmath65 contributes when one of the @xmath1 jets is missed .",
