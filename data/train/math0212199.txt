    "transform @xmath11 of a function @xmath12 is the function whose values at the critical points of @xmath19 agrees with those of @xmath20 for _ all _ values of the phase parameter @xmath21    the discussion in the introduction can thus be summarized as follows :    the function @xmath22 is the @xmath15 transform of @xmath23    to get an analogous result for a general function @xmath24 we perform the same sort of computation as in the introduction :    ( we will use the notation @xmath25 for the derivative of @xmath26 for typographical reasons . ) the critical points of @xmath13 are the points where : @xmath27 expanding , we see that @xmath28 and so @xmath29 so that @xmath30 while @xmath31 combining eq .",

    "( [ eqval3 ] ) we see that at the critical points : @xmath32 which we can summarize in    the function @xmath11 is defined by @xmath33    here are some examples : as we have seen before , if @xmath34 then @xmath35    , title=\"fig : \" ] +    if @xmath36 then @xmath37    , title=\"fig : \" ] +    if @xmath38 then @xmath39 while if @xmath40 then @xmath41    , title=\"fig : \" ] +    if @xmath42 then @xmath43",
    "we will need to recall a definition :    a function @xmath44 is called _ algebraic _ if there exists a two - variable polynomial @xmath45 such that @xmath46    and some well - known results :    [ elim ] if @xmath47 is an algebraic function of @xmath48 and @xmath48 is an algebraic function of @xmath49 then @xmath47 is an algebraic function of @xmath50 further , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are algebraic functions of @xmath49 then so are @xmath53 and @xmath54 finally , if @xmath48 is an algebraic function , then so is @xmath55    the proofs of all the assertions follow from the following basic fact : two univariate polynomials @xmath56 and @xmath57 over a domain @xmath58 with unity have no common zeros if and only if their greatest common divisor is @xmath59 or , equivalently , there exist polynomials @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that @xmath62 since eq .",
    "( [ gcdeq ] ) is a system of linear equations for the coefficients of @xmath60 and @xmath61 the existence of @xmath60 and @xmath63 as above is easily seen to be equivalent to the non - vanishing of the determinant of the linear system .",
    "this determinant is the so - called _ resultant _ of the polynomials @xmath56 and @xmath64 now , if we have two polynomial equations @xmath65 and @xmath66 they can regarded as two polynomials in @xmath48 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath49 and so the set of @xmath67-coordinates of the points in the common zero - set of @xmath68 and @xmath69 all have the property that at those points , the resultant of the two equations vanishes .",
    "the resultant is a polynomial in @xmath49 and so @xmath48 has been eliminated from consideration , hence the name `` elimination theory . ''",
    "now , to proceed with the proof of the theorem [ elim ] : if @xmath47 is an algebraic function of @xmath48 and @xmath48 is an algebraic function of @xmath49 then there are equations @xmath70 and @xmath71 eliminating @xmath48 from the two equations , we see that @xmath47 is algebraic .",
    "if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are algebraic , and @xmath72 then we have the the three equations ( the ones satisfied by @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath73 we can eliminate first @xmath51 and then @xmath74 to show that @xmath48 is algebraic , similarly with @xmath54    finally , to show that the derivative is algebraic , we differentiate @xmath75 implicitly , to obtain @xmath76 eliminating @xmath48 from the two equations we obtain the algebricity of @xmath55    for considerably more detail on the subject of elimination , please see @xcite .    as corollaries of the above theorem",
    ", we see that    if @xmath77 is an algebraic function , then so is @xmath78 if @xmath79 are algebraic functions , then if @xmath80 it follows that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is algebraic .",
    "the first obvious inverse problem is the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ which functions @xmath83 are @xmath15 transforms ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    construction of the inverse transform is equivalent to the solution of the ode @xmath84 the choice of plus or minus is already troubling , as is the fact that the right hand side is frequently not lipschitz , so the usual picard existence theorem for ode does not apply everywhere , and uniqueness fails spectacularly : the functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 have the same @xmath15 transform .",
    "this example also demonstrates that the initial value problem can develop singularities in finite time .",
    "nevertheless , some things can be said .",
    "first :    [ invlem ] the transformed function @xmath11 has a critical point whenever @xmath26 has a critical point .",
    "furthermore , at such a critical point @xmath49 @xmath87 and the last equality only holds at a critical point of @xmath88    a simple computation .",
    "we can thus simplify our life by attempting to solve [ invode ] on an interval @xmath89 $ ] where @xmath90 is monotone , and in addition , @xmath91 we can pick between the two equations : @xmath92    now , by the lemma [ invlem ] we know that we have local existence and uniqueness of solutions , and so the only thing we need check is that singularities do not develop in finite time . to do this we analyze two separate cases :    * case 1 .",
    "@xmath83 is _ decreasing _ on @xmath89.$ ] in this case we take eq .",
    "( [ invodem ] ) . local existence and uniqueness",
    "is assured by the picard theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) ) .",
    "we pick the initial value @xmath93 at will ( as long as it is bigger than @xmath94 ) since @xmath95 is always negative we know that @xmath96 and since we know that @xmath97 on @xmath89 $ ] we know that @xmath98 so it follows that we have a solution on @xmath89.$ ] * case 2 .",
    "@xmath83 is _",
    "increasing_. in this case we start at the right endpoint @xmath99 and use eq .",
    "( [ invodep ] ) , and then construct the solution going right to left . the reasoning in case 1 goes through verbatim .    what happens if @xmath83 has critical points on @xmath89 $ ] ? in that case",
    ", it is fairly obvious that we can construct a `` weak inverse , '' but anything more seems to require much more work . in case the reader is dissatisfied with the nonexplicit nature of our construction , ( s)he will perhaps be mollified by the observation that the following problem can be solved explicitly :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a function @xmath100 on @xmath89,$ ] construct a positive @xmath24 such that @xmath101 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    using eq .",
