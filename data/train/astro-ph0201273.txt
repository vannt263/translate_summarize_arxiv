    "adaptive optics ( ao ) has been used for astronomical observations for more than a decade and numerous medium - to - large telescopes around the world are now equipped with ao systems .",
    "if an ao system s wavefront sensor operates at different wavelengths than are being observed by the science instrument , and no correction is made for atmospheric differential refraction , the target object will appear to drift with respect to the science instrument .",
    "an example of the problem this phenomenon can introduce is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : titanimage ] which is the difference of two images of saturn s moon titan taken just 2.5 minutes apart while continuously tracking and correcting on titan with the keck ii telescope s ao system .",
    "the maximum exposure time possible without degrading the spatial resolution of the data is significantly restricted if no correction for atmospheric differential refraction is made .",
    "adaptive optics systems for astronomical observing operate by splitting the incoming light into two beams , one of which goes to the wavefront sensor of the ao system and the goes to the science instrument . in many cases",
    "a dichroic optic is used as the beamsplitter in order to send visible light ( @xmath3 m ) to the wavefront sensor and infrared light ( @xmath4 m ) to the science instrument .",
    "examples of telescopes with ao systems that can operate in this way include the 3-m shane telescope at lick observatory @xcite , the cfht 3.6-m telescope @xcite , the gemini    north 8-m telescope @xcite , and both of the w.m .",
    "keck observatory s 10-m telescopes @xcite .",
    "the wavefront sensor measures the distortions to the wavefront and a correction is calculated and applied to a deformable mirror .",
    "the first order of distortion that an ao system is called upon to correct is simply image motion , commonly known as ` tip / tilt ' .",
    "if significant tip / tilt residuals remain after ao correction then the resulting data will be of lower spatial resolution , regardless of how well the ao system corrects for the higher order terms of focus , astigmatism , coma , and so forth .",
    "minimizing tip / tilt residuals is critical to achieving optimum performance from an ao system . the effect of atmospheric differential refraction is to introduce a systematic tip / tilt error that an ao system will not correct for unless specifically accounted for in the ao control software .",
    "for ease in the remainder of this report we will refer to atmospheric differential refraction as `` adr '' .",
    "problems due to adr arise when the ao system is correcting on visible wavelength light and the science instrument is observing at infrared wavelengths . from visible to infrared wavelengths the refractive index of air decreases sharply , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : indexofrefraction ] . a star s visible pointing center always appears at higher elevation than a star s infrared pointing center , except when the star is at the zenith . that the two pointing centers do not coincide is not unto itself a problem for the typical ao system , however the offset between the two pointing centers is not constant . without some consideration for",
    "the effect of adr , a properly performing ao system will hold the visible pointing center of the star fixed , relative to both the wavefront sensor and the science camera .",
    "however as time progresses and the star moves in elevation , the infrared pointing center will drift with respect to the visible pointing center , and thus in the infrared the star appears to drift with respect to the science instrument .",
    "observers must consider this effect in determining the maximum exposure times in order to avoid ` trailed ' images , unless some other compensation is made .    0.3 in    in this paper we present calculations demonstrating when and how much of a problem adr can be for an ao system .",
    "using data taken with the ao system on the keck ii telescope we show that in a long exposure , or sequence of exposures , the most significant uncorrected tip - tilt motion is due to the effect of adr . we further show that the effect of adr is dependent on the spectral type , or color , of the star being used as a reference source . finally , we discuss the implications of adr for ao observing with current and currently proposed telescopes .",
    "the code used in these calculations is available with the electronic version of this paper or by request from the author .",
    "while the code is written in the commonly used idl programming language , it could easily be translated to other languages .",
    "we encourage others to investigate the implications of adr for their favourite telescope , site , target , observing strategy , etc ..",
    "the equations necessary for calculating the effect of adr are given by @xcite . from @xcite the refractive index of air @xmath5 at pressure @xmath6 millibar , temperature @xmath7 kelvin , partial pressure of water vapor @xmath8 millibar for the water vapor correction .",

    "observers typically work at much more modest zenith distances of @xmath17 where this approximation is extremely good .",
    "atmospheric differential refraction between two wavelengths ( e.g.@xmath18 of an ao wavefront sensor and @xmath19 of a science instrument ) is then @xmath20 note that equation  [ eqn : diffrefract ] is written to give a positive angular distance since the zenith distance of the visible pointing center , @xmath21 , will be less than that of the infrared pointing center , @xmath22 .",
    "the true zenith distance ( @xmath13 ) is related to latitude of the observer ( @xmath23 ) , declination of the target ( @xmath24 ) , and hour angle of the target ( @xmath25 ) by @xmath26    to relate the adr offset of equation  [ eqn : diffrefract ] to the ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) coordinates of a detector array oriented arbitrarily with respect to the sky , we introduce several angles . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] the parallactic angle ( @xmath29 ) is the angle from the sky north vector counter - clockwise to the elevation - up vector .",
    "position angle ( @xmath30 ) is the angle from the increasing y - direction of the detector array clockwise to the sky north vector .",
    "finally , the difference of posang minus parang gives the angle from the increasing y - direction clockwise to the elevation up vector .",
    "in the ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) coordinates of the detector array the offset from visible pointing center to infrared pointing center is then @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is arcseconds per pixel of the array .",
    "the parallactic angle ( @xmath29 ) is a function    0.5 in    of hour angle , declination , and latitude , @xmath34    in the coordinate system of elevation and azimuth , the motion of the infrared pointing center relative to the visible pointing center due to adr is always along the elevation vector .",
    "however , most observations are made using a field rotator such that instrument coordinates remain fixed relative to right ascension and declination .",
    "therefore the instrument coordinate system rotates relative to elevation and azimuth .",
    "the important point is that the instrument coordinate system rotates about the visible pointing center .",
    "thus , the effective motion of the infrared pointing center in instrument coordinates is not along the elevation vector except when the parallactic angle is unchanging . in the images of titan differenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : titanimage ] the parallactic angle was nearly unchanging and therefore the motion due to adr appears along the elevation vector . in later examples the parallactic angle is changing rapidly and then",
    "the apparent motion is not along the elevation vector .",
    "equation  [ eqn : diffrefract ] gives the instantaneous offset between visible and infrared pointing centers , but it is the first derivative of @xmath35 with respect to time that causes the problem addressed in this paper . in the extreme case of an ao equipped telescope at the south pole , adr , as described in this current report , is not a problem since targets do not move in elevation angle .    in order to find the instantaneous rate of image motion due to adr we define the constant @xmath36 and take the partial derivative of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with respect to hour angle .",
    "@xmath39 the partial derivatives of @xmath13 and @xmath29 with respect to @xmath25 are @xmath40 @xmath41 the combination of eqns .",
    "[ eqn : beta ] , [ eqn : dzddh ] , and [ eqn : dparangdh ] with @xmath42 into eqns .",
    "[ eqn : dxoffset ] and [ eqn : dyoffset ] gives the instantaneous rate of image motion in the x / y - plane of the detector .",
    "the idl routine _ adr_rateofmotion.pro _ included in the electronic version of this paper calculates this instantaneous rate of image motion .    finding the maximum exposure time allowed before the image motion exceeds some given limit is not as straightforward as simply dividing the desired image motion limit by the instantaneous rate of image motion at the start of the exposure",
    "this is because the image motion is usually curved in the x / y - plane and because the second partial derivatives of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with respect to time are not constants .",
    "therefore , the most direct method of determining the maximum exposure time is to calculate @xmath37 and @xmath38    with fine time sampling and simply search for the point at which the maximum desired image motion has been exceeded .",
    "the idl routine _ adr_maxexptime.pro _ , included in the electronic version of this paper , calculates the maximum allowed exposure time .",
    "output from these calculations for an observation with the keck telescope is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : examplecalc ] . the predicted motion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : examplecalc]a depends on site , but not diameter of telescope , while the maximum exposure times shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : examplecalc]b are based on the 10-meter diameter of the keck telescopes .",
    "a smaller telescope has a coarser diffraction limit and therefore is less affected by the issue of drift due to differential refraction , however some smaller telescopes are at lower sites ( e.g.  the shane 3-m of lick observatory ) where differential refraction is greater . a smaller telescope at a higher altitude",
    ", higher latitude site suffers less from adr than a larger telescope at a lower altitude , lower latitude site .",
    "the implications of adr for several current and proposed telescopes are discussed in section 4 .",
    "a critical parameter in calculating the implications of adr is the effective wavelength of the reference source on the wavefront sensor .",
    "the wavefront sensor of an ao system is often photon limited and therefore designed to have as broad a wavelength bandpass as possible . in the case of a broad wavefront sensor bandpass , the effective wavelength of the reference source on the wavefront sensor depends on the color of source , as we will show in section 3 using observed data . usually of less importance is the effective wavelength of the target on the science instrument since the variation of air s refractive index with wavelength is much less in the near - infrared than in the visible .",

    "knowing @xmath54 of the science target on the science instrument is less critical since the index of refraction of air varies much more gradually at near - infrared wavelengths than visible wavelengths . in the following sections we investigate both of these cases for several existing and proposed telescopes . an alternative technique for adr correction is to insert an atmospheric dispersion corrector between the telescope and ao system .",
    "this approach would be effective in many situations , although it does invariably lead to at least some loss of throughput and increase in thermal background .",
    "any increase in thermal background is detrimental to observations at longer near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we also discuss the importance of considering the effect of adr when attempting slit - spectroscopy with an ao system .      in the following we adopt the maximum acceptable drift in a single exposure to be 0.25 of the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the diffraction limited core of the science instrument point spread function ( psf ) , i.e.  1.04 @xmath61 radian , where @xmath9 is the wavelength of the science observation and @xmath62 is the diameter of the telescope aperture .",

    "for all of these examples we use the latitude of mauna kea observatory in hawaii ( 19@xmath44826 n ) , but clearly if the sign of the target declination is reversed then these figures would be correct for an observatory at 19@xmath44826 s latitude . in general ,",
    "an observer closer to the equator will be affected more by adr than an observer at one of the poles , who will not have to contend with the problems discussed here .",

    "these cones - of - avoidance are not considered in these calculations , but obviously this will further restrict maximum exposure times on targets that transit near the zenith .",
    "figure  [ fig : maxexptimes ] contains contour plots of maximum exposure time in minutes as a function of target declination and hour angle at the start of the exposure .",
    "although few , if any , 4-meter class telescopes are located at sea level , figure  [ fig : maxexptimes]a shows such a case .",
    "comparison to figure  [ fig : maxexptimes]b , the case of a 4-meter telescope on mauna kea , conveys the importance of altitude when considering adr . in typical near - infrared observations",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is often background limited in just a few minutes .",
    "so long as the data are background limited , there is no disadvantage to breaking up a long exposure into several shorter exposures . for 4-meter class telescopes",
    "this means that adr will not often be a siginificant problem , except when nearing the readnoise limited regime such as the cases of imaging through narrowband filters or during spectroscopic observations .",
    "we initially encountered the problem of adr while observing with the keck ii 10-meter telescope , and figure  [ fig : maxexptimes]c shows the maximum exposure time for this case . since maximum exposure time scales nearly linearly with telescope diameter , a wider range of observing strategies",
    "are impacted .",
    "again , wideband filter imaging programs will often find their snr background limited before being adr limited , but most narrowband imaging and spectroscopic projects will now find that adr places significantly shorter limits on exposure time than achieving the background limit of the snr .",
    "we discuss another important issue concerning spectroscopic observations in section 4.3 .",
    "finally , discussions are currently underway about the prospect of building even larger diameter telescopes .",
    "the proposals range in telescope diameter up to 100-meters and usually include plans for an ao system . to our knowledge",
    "no firm commitments have been made by any group regarding location or size of these proposed telescopes . in figure",
    "[ fig : maxexptimes]d we show how important adr becomes for a 30-meter telescope on mauna kea , where maximum exposure times are reduced to a minute or less .",
    "clearly any plans for new , extremely - large telescopes must include a way of correcting for the effect of adr .",
    "the guide star s @xmath54 on the wfs will often not be known to high precision due either to uncertainties in the spectrum of the star or the shape of the passband of the wfs .",
    "thus , even if an ao system is designed to account for adr there may still be some image motion due to imperfect knowledge of @xmath54 on the wfs .",
    "the routine _ adr_maxexptime2.pro _ , included in the electronic version of this paper , calculates the maximum exposure time assuming the ao system is correcting for the effect of adr using @xmath65 as @xmath54 on the wfs while @xmath66 is the actual @xmath54 on the wfs . when calculating the maximum exposure time ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are reciprocal , e.g.  the maximum exposure time is the same in the case of @xmath67 m and @xmath68 m as in the case of @xmath69 m and @xmath70 m . in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxexptimes2 ] we show contour plots of maximum exposure time as a function of hour angle and target elevation for a series of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we use the parameters of a 10-meter telescope on mauna kea , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxexptimes]c . in each case",
    "the error between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is 0.1@xmath1 m and the wavelengths examined are 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.9 @xmath1 m . at shorter wavelengths an 0.1 @xmath1 m error in the wavelength of correction results in the maximum exposure time being increased by only a factor of less than two .",
    "however , at longer wavelengths the same error of 0.1 @xmath1 m has much less impact and maximum exposure times are increased by a factor of six .",
    "this demonstrates that a bluer wavefront sensor passband and/or blue reference source is much less tolerant of errors in the estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "the reason for this significant difference in error tolerance at red and blue visible wavelengths lies in the shape of the curve of refractive index as a function of wavelength , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : indexofrefraction ] .",
    "the ability to measure the wavefront distortion at a wavelength with a similar index of refraction as the wavelength of observation is one of many reasons that infrared wavefront sensors are appealing .",
    "the implications of adr for slit - spectroscopy are somewhat more complicated than for imaging . along the direction of the slit",
    "the issue of image motion is the same , and simply leads to degraded spatial resolution , as happened to the spectrum taken during the images of titan shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : titanimage ] .",
    "however , with spectroscopy one is also concerned with the possibility of biasing the spectrum of the light sent through the slit to the spectrometer .",
    "irrespective of adr , a narrow slit and/or misalignment of the slit on the target can lead to biased spectra .",
    "the easiest way to understand this problem is to imagine a narrow slit centered on the 6.5 in    -0.25 in    0.3 in    3.0 in    core of the psf versus the same slit partway off center .",
    "because the psf of the bluer end of the spectrum is narrower than the psf of the red end of the spectrum , the spectrum from the off - center slit will be biased to the red .",
    "residual image motion perpendicular to the slit risks introducing a color bias to the resulting spectrum .    in the case",
    "that adr is not perfectly compensated and image motion results , observers taking spectra should be aware of the choice they are making when orienting their slit . aligning",
    "the slit parallel to the direction of motion due to adr means degraded spatial resolution along the slit , however this will not introduce any extra color - bias to the spectrum . aligning",
    "the slit perpendicular to this means conserving spatial resolution along the slit , however there is then a risk of introducing a spectral color bias , especially if the target is a point source and the exposure is long .",
    "further , if the target is extended and the slit is oriented perpendicular to the motion of adr the spatial resolution of the data is also degraded . ideally for spectral observers adr would be adequately compensated for by the ao system and the observer would not need to worry about these complications . in the case that the adr correction is poor or non - existent observers can calculate the direction of motion due to adr from equations  [ eqn : dxoffset]-[eqn : dyoffset ] , implemented in the routine _ adr_rateofmotion.pro _ , and decide for themselves the tradeoff between spectral integrity and spatial resolution .",
    "using theoretical calculations and data from the w.m .",
    "keck ii telescope we demonstrate that atmospheric differential refraction ( adr ) should be considered when designing and building adaptive optics ( ao ) systems .",
    "we present calculations and idl code for others to calculate the effect of adr for their own particular observing parameters .",
    "the primary effect of adr on typical ao observations is to reduce the maximum exposure time possible without significant image blurring .",
    "maximum exposure time decreases approximately linearly with increasing telescope size .",
    "due to the variation of the refractive index of air across visible wavelengths , the maximum exposure time is strongly a function of the effective wavelength of the wavefront sensor .",
    "the other important parameters in calculating maximum exposure time are observatory altitude and latitude , target declination and hour angle , and , to a lesser extent during typical near - infrared science observations , the effective wavelength of the science observations .",
    "planning for ao systems on larger ( @xmath71-meter ) future telescopes must include consideration for how to compensate for the effect of adr .",
