    "<S> moreover , in turn , the calculation of the rapidity gap survival factors , @xmath8 , for diffractive processes depend on the properties of the triple - pomeron vertex . </S>",

    "<S> in addition the production of a system @xmath3 of high mass @xmath15 is described by pomeron exchange with trajectory @xmath16 ; leading to a diagram with a triple - pomeron vertex , which is shown on the right - hand - side of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . in this formalism </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 cross section is given by @xcite m_y^2  =  g_a^2(t ) g_b(0 ) g_3p(t ) ( ) ^1+_p(0)-2_p(t ) ( ) ^_p(0)-1  + rrp+ppr  terms [ eq : trf ] with @xmath17 and where @xmath18 is the centre - of - mass energy of the incoming @xmath19 system . </S>",

    "<S> is shown explicitly in ( [ eq : trf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are also contributions rrp , ppr , ... in which secondary reggeons r replace the upper and/or lower pomeron exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the rrp term may give some contribution as @xmath10 decreases away from 1 , and the ppr term may give some effect if the mass @xmath15 is not sufficiently large .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the determinations of the triple - pomeron coupling @xmath20 from data for the hadronic @xmath21 processes @xcite are , at best , just estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that no account is taken of the soft rescattering . in such a rescattering </S>",
    "<S> the leading hadron will produce new secondary particles and , as a consequence , its value of @xmath10 will be diminished . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays this effect is called the rapidity gap survival factor @xmath8 , since the secondaries populate and destroy the rapidity gap , @xmath22 ln @xmath23 , between the leading hadron @xmath9 and the hadrons in the system @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath8 was not accounted for explicitly , the determinations give only an _ effective _ value of the triple - pomeron vertex , which implicitly embodies an @xmath8 factor . </S>",
    "<S> however the probability of soft rescattering , and hence the @xmath8 factor , depends on the nature of the incoming and leading hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the value of @xmath8 depends on the kinematical variables of the process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly it is important to find a way to measure the universal _ bare _ triple - pomeron vertex , free from these rescattering effects .    , which is described by a diagram with a triple - pomeron vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath14 , which is always the case for the observed triple - pomeron processes.,height=188 ]    a good illustration of the situation is an analogous problem which arises in the analysis of leading neutron production at hera @xcite . there , to understand the process we need to allow for rescattering ( absorptive ) corrections to pure regge @xmath24 exchange . the rescattering modifies the predictions of not only the absolute value , but also the @xmath7 dependence of leading neutron production . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively it reduces the cross section by a factor of 0.4 , and changes the @xmath7 slope , @xmath25 by 1 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 dependence of the triple - pomeron vertex plays a crucial role in the solution of the so - called finkelstein - kajantie problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if we neglect the @xmath7 dependence of the vertex and the gap survival factor , then it turns out , even in the case @xmath28 , that the cross section for multigap events grows as a power of the energy , and so violates the froissart limit . </S>",
    "<S> each additional gap brings a ln@xmath29 factor arising from the integral over the gap size . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of these ln@xmath29 factors leads to the power behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> two solutions were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> first , the _ weak coupling _ solution in which the vertex _ vanishes _ as @xmath30 @xcite . in this case the ln@xmath29 factor arising from the gap size is compensated by a 1/ln@xmath29 caused by the shrinkage of the @xmath7 distribution with increasing energy . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it predicts that , at ultra high energies , the total cross sections @xmath31 will tend to a universal constant independent of @xmath13 and @xmath32 @xcite . an alternative possibility is to suppress the multigap events by a strong absorptive correction , that is by decreasing the gap survival factors . </S>",
    "<S> in other words a large multigap cross section , calculated using a bare triple - pomeron vertex which is _ non - vanishing _ as @xmath30 , is multiplied by a gap survival factor which decreases faster with energy than the bare cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the froissart - like black disc limit , and is called the </S>",
    "<S> _ strong coupling _ </S>",
    "<S> solution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the old hadron - hadron data of ( [ eq : hh ] ) show no indication that the triple - pomeron vertex vanishes as @xmath30 . however these data are inconclusive regarding the @xmath7 behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , if it were to vanish , this behaviour would only be apparent at rather small @xmath7 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the typical transverse size of the incoming hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the data are not precise enough in this small @xmath7 region . </S>",
    "<S> second , the effect is masked by the pomeron cut contribution  soft rescattering washes out the momentum transferred through the individual pomeron , and zero @xmath35 of the leading hadron does not mean that the momentum transfer in the bare triple - pomeron vertex is @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that after accounting for multi - pomeron effects , the old hadron - hadron data can not eliminate the possibility that the bare triple - pomeron vertex vanishes as @xmath30 .     </S>",
    "<S> photoproduction , @xmath37 , which is described by a diagram with a triple - pomeron vertex in which the rescattering effects are small . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line would mean the diagram became an enhanced diagram  this contribution is small . </S>",
    "<S> , height=188 ]    it is clearly important to study the triple - pomeron interaction in a process where the rescattering effects are absent or strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> such a process , which is experimentally accessible , is proton dissociation in diffractive @xmath38 photo- ( or electro- ) production  +  p   j/  +  y. [ eq;psi ] the process is shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . by detecting the @xmath2 in the final state , we select the charm component of the photon wave function , which has a small size of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> such a component has a small absorptive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the probability of an additional rescattering is much weaker . even in the case of a nuclear target </S>",
    "<S> the probability of @xmath2 rescattering is small @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , there may be some ` enhanced ' absorptive corrections ( of the type indicated by the dotted pomeron - exchange line on the diagram on the right - hand - side of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the phenomenological analysis of leading neutron data @xcite demonstrates that such corrections are small at the available hera energies . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the probability to observe a leading neutron would strongly depend on the initial @xmath40 energy , @xmath41 , in contradiction with the data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to provide enough phase space for such an ` enhanced ' correction , we would need to have sufficiently large rapidity intervals ( either side of the dotted line ) between the different vertices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an extremely small value of @xmath42 , which is beyond the reach of the present experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of the process @xmath37 is that , thanks to the small size of the @xmath2 meson , the vanishing of the triple - pomeron vertex ( if true ) would reveal itself over a more extended region of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is practically already eliminated by the present data , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can conclude that the strong coupling solution of the triple - pomeron interaction is confirmed by the hera @xmath2 data .    </S>",
    "<S> though the process @xmath37 is experimentally accessible at hera , so far no dedicated measurements are available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> however some information does exist , as the process has been considered as a background to elastic @xmath2 production , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this somewhat fragmentary information allows us to make the following observations . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath44 and @xmath45 to denote the two @xmath2 production cross sections .    * the energy dependence of @xmath2 production with proton dissociation and for the elastic process are consistent with each other . if we write _ </S>",
    "<S> i  w^_i where @xmath46 is the photon - proton centre - of - mass energy , then @xcite @xmath47 next , the @xmath15 dependence @xcite for a fixed value of the ratio @xmath48 is consistent with the behaviour of hadronic total cross sections , that is _ y ( m_y^2)^  with  0.08 . [ </S>",
    "<S> eq : tot ] the above results are the properties expected from the triple - pomeron term and @xmath12 in ( [ eq : trf ] ) , that is in the triple - pomeron diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> the lower pomeron @xmath16 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] is the usual ` soft ' pomeron ; whereas the upper ones , with @xmath12 , include dglap evolution from a low initial scale @xmath49 up to a rather large scale @xmath50 at the @xmath38 production vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the summation of the double logarithms @xmath51 leads to a steeper @xmath52-dependence and hence to a larger effective intercept for the trajectory @xmath12 of the upper ` hard ' pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> thus in ( [ eq : el ] ) and ( [ eq : tot ] ) we have @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ] in ( [ eq : trf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> * the @xmath7 slope of @xmath2 production by proton dissociation is observed @xcite to be rather small , @xmath56 . in some sense , we can regard @xmath57 to be driven by the pomeron form factor . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the slope for elastic @xmath2 production , which is driven by the proton form factor , is measured @xcite to be @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the size of the pomeron and the triple - pomeron vertex are much less than that for the proton . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion about the small size of the triple - pomeron vertex is confirmed by the data on @xmath59 production , where the difference of slopes , @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these properties justify the idea that the pure triple - pomeron coupling may be extracted from a triple - regge analysis of data for @xmath2 production with proton dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> the small size of the pomeron indicates that the rescattering corrections are indeed small . </S>",
    "<S> this information comes from a consideration of proton dissociation as a background process in the presentation of elastic @xmath2 production data . </S>",
    "<S> however there is more detailed information on the @xmath7 dependence of the proton dissociation process in fig . 4 of @xcite , that we mentioned previously . * </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the cross sections is also revealing . for @xmath2 production , </S>",
    "<S> an approximate estimate gives @xcite _ y / _ el  1 0.3 , while for @xmath59 production we have @xcite _ y / _ el  0.6 0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in the values of the ratios is anticipated because strong absorption is expected in the case of @xmath44 for @xmath59 production .    </S>",
    "<S> the above summary of the existing , admittedly fragmentary , data on @xmath37 certainly supports a dominant triple - pomeron behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> so we may attempt an extraction of the _ bare _ triple - pomeron coupling , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the data for @xmath44 , collected @xcite in the interval . </S>",
    "<S> ] of @xmath15 from 2.5 gev up to @xmath61 , is described just by the triple - pomeron term in ( [ eq : trf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . then dm_y^2  /  =  g^bare_3p(0)j  /  g_n(0 ) , where we estimate that the integration over @xmath15 gives the factor @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> in this way we find g^bare_3p(0 )  /  g_n(0 )   1  /  3 . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : bare ] this has to be compared with the ratio extracted @xcite many years ago from hadron - hadron initiated data g^effective_3p(0 )  /  g_n(0 )   1  /  10 . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion of the coupling in the old estimate , due to the survival factors , is clearly evident . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that including absorptive effects gives a larger value of the triple - pomeron coupling , is not new . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of @xmath63 were obtained , for example , in @xcite . however all the previous estimates are model dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we can not sum up all the reggeon diagrams which describe the absorptive effects . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the value of @xmath63 depends on the class of multi - pomeron diagrams chosen for resummation , on the assumptions about the behaviour of the multi - pomeron vertices , and sometimes on the threshold factor in the multi - pomeron vertices , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the present evaluation of @xmath63 is that we study a process where the absorptive corrections are small , and so affect the final result much less .    of course </S>",
    "<S> , in the integration over @xmath15 , we can not neglect the possible contributions of secondary reggeons in ( [ eq : trf ] ) , such as the rrp term near the upper limit of the integral and the ppr term for @xmath15 close to @xmath15(min ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath64 is therefore expected to be a bit smaller than in ( [ eq : bare ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus crucially important to have @xmath37 data with an explicit measurement of the @xmath15 spectrum in order to perform a full triple - regge analysis in which we quantify the different triple - regge contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion in this paper has implications for all diffractive processes . </S>",
    "<S> we mention two topical examples , both of which illustrate the importance of the energy dependence of the survival factor @xmath8 . in the existing monte carlos for high energy multiparticle production , </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of leading particles are parametrized in the triple - regge form . in comparison with the limiting fragmentation or feymann scaling hypothesis @xcite , where the normalized cross section does not depend on energy , we now have  =   ( 1-x_l)^_p(0)-2_p(t )  s_sd^2(s , t ) </S>",
    "<S> , [ eq : sss ] which depends , not only on @xmath10 , but on the energy ) does not allow for the effects of migration which , as we have seen in the case of the leading neutrons @xcite , give a noticeable contribution for @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore ( [ eq : sss ] ) is only valid in its present form for @xmath66 . also ( [ eq : sss ] ) </S>",
    "<S> contains just the ppp - contribution . for @xmath67 allowance </S>",
    "<S> should be made for a rrp contribution with its own @xmath68 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence comes entirely from the survival factor @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> so , before we discuss the two examples , we compute the energy dependence of @xmath70 . as before , we use sd to denote single - particle diffractive dissociation .    , for single ( soft and hard ) diffractive dissociation , via the triple - pomeron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the gzk energy , @xmath71 ev , is the theoretical upper ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin @xcite ) limit on the energy of cosmic rays which arises from the large cross section for the interaction of the protons with relic photons due to @xmath72 isobar production.,height=453 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] we show the expected energy dependence of the survival factor @xmath69 for the cross section integrated over @xmath7 . this was calculated in a simplified two - channel eikonal model with the @xmath7 dependence of the elastic pomeron - proton vertex , @xmath73 , given by the proton electromagnetic form factor @xmath74 , that is @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the pomeron trajectory were tuned to describe the cern - isr , cern - sps and tevatron elastic data . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the figure that the energy dependence of @xmath69 is quite pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the predictions for @xmath69 obtained using a two - channel eikonal are stable decrease and the values at ultra high energies become too low and unstable . ] to changing the details of the model , after the ` soft ' parametrization is tuned to fit the elastic data .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuous curve in fig .  [ fig:3 ] is for _ soft _ diffractive dissociation . here </S>",
    "<S> the process takes place at relatively large impact parameters @xmath76 , where the absorption is not so strong . </S>",
    "<S> suppose , instead , we were to consider _ hard _ diffractive dissociation , for example where a pair of high @xmath77 jets @xcite or a heavy quark pair or @xmath46 or @xmath78 boson or some other heavy object is produced within the system @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in these cases the interaction takes place at much smaller @xmath76 . here , in the central @xmath76 region </S>",
    "<S> , the absorption is stronger and the corresponding @xmath69 factor is smaller , especially at ultra high energies where the proton opacity becomes very close to the black disc limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for completeness , we also show the predictions for the energy dependence of @xmath69 for hard diffractive dissociation , by the dashed curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> our first topical example , where the energy dependence of @xmath69 plays an important role , is the evaluation of the so - called pile - up backgrounds to forward physics studies at the lhc , see , for instance , @xcite . at high lhc luminosities , the soft pile - up single ( and even double ) </S>",
    "<S> diffractive processes can fake the signal from hard diffractive events due to overlap with the non - diffractive hard processes observed in the central detector </S>",
    "<S> . however , when we allow for the energy dependence of @xmath69 ( for soft diffraction ) , we decrease the predicted leading proton spectra at the lhc energies , as compared to the leading proton spectrum measured at hera @xcite . a preliminary estimate found @xcite for leading neutrons at hera . for leading protons the value of @xmath8 may be a bit smaller , since a pomeron - exchange interaction has smaller @xmath76 than for @xmath24-exchange leading neutron production . to obtain a quantitative estimate of the reduction factor it will be necessary to perform a careful analysis of the leading protons produced in ddis @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> gives a reduction by about a factor of 3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the impact of pile - up is be suppressed by the energy dependence of @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second example illustrates the importance of the energy dependence of @xmath69 to the analysis of ultra high energy cosmic ray data . </S>",
    "<S> the observed structure of the extensive cosmic ray air showers depends sensitively on the spectrum of the leading hadrons . from the continuous curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] we see that in going from hera energies to the gzk cut - off energy @xcite , the survival probability @xmath69 decreases by almost an order of magnitude . of course </S>",
    "<S> , the small values of @xmath69 at ultra high energies do not mean that the leading hadron disappears . instead , </S>",
    "<S> after the rescattering , the large @xmath10 hadron migrates to a lower @xmath10 and larger @xmath35 domain @xcite , thereby changing the shape of the extensive air shower . </S>"
