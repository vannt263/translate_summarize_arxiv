    "the category @xmath5 of mixed twistor @xmath0-modules on @xmath4 , introduced by t.mochizuki @xcite , represents a vast generalization of that of mixed hodge modules on @xmath4 , introduced by m.saito @xcite and denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "stands for @xmath7 ,  [ subsec : mhm ] . ]",
    "an intermediate step to compare these categories is the category @xmath8 of integrable mixed twistor @xmath0-modules on @xmath4 ( see below ) .",
    "there are natural functors @xmath9 where the second functor forgets the integrable structure , while the first one is a natural fully faithful functor compatible with the standard functors on each category ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the category @xmath8 contains much more objects , since the holonomic @xmath0-module underlying a mixed hodge module has regular singularities , while that underlying an object of @xmath8 can have arbitrary complicated irregular singularities .",
    "one drawback of the category @xmath8 ( or @xmath5 ) is that objects do not come with many numerical invariants , like hodge numbers .",
    "our aim is to introduce an intermediate category between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , which is not as large as @xmath8 , but so that the @xmath0-module associated to each object is equipped with a good filtration , called the _ irregular hodge filtration_. many interesting irregular holonomic @xmath0-modules underlie objects in this category , in particular those generated by @xmath1 , where  @xmath2 is any meromorphic function on  @xmath4 . some of the standard functors ( push - forward by a projective morphism , pull - back by a smooth morphism ) extend to this category , that we call the category of ( possibly ) _ irregular mixed hodge modules _ and that we denote by @xmath10 , and the filtered holonomic @xmath0-module associated to any object has a good behaviour with respect to these functors .",
    "the original idea of finding such a category is due to deligne in 1984 @xcite , and has waited the development of the theory of wild twistor @xmath0-modules @xcite to start a new life in @xcite , before being considered from different points of view in @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize some discrepancies between the usual hodge filtration and the irregular hodge filtration .    1 .",
    "a mixed hodge module can naturally be seen as an object of @xmath10 , and in such a way its hodge filtration is the irregular hodge filtration",
    ". however , the properties of the irregular hodge filtration of the @xmath0-module underlying an object of @xmath10 are not enough to characterize this object as such , are not constitutive of the definition of an object of @xmath10 , while the hodge filtration is one of the fundamental objects used to define a hodge module .",
    "in other words , the irregular hodge filtration is only a byproduct of the definition of the category @xmath10 , and the main properties of this category are obtained from those of @xmath8 .",
    "recall that the behaviour of the hodge filtration with respect to nearby cycles is one of the fundamental properties used to define the category @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , we do not exhibit any such property for the irregular hodge filtration .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a similar behaviour occurs with respect to a divisor along which the mixed twistor @xmath0-module is _ tame _ , but we do not even have a conjectural statement in general .",
    "let us indicate the main lines of the definition of @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by  @xmath11 the product space @xmath12 of  @xmath4 with the complex line with coordinate @xmath13 , and by @xmath14 the circle @xmath15 .",
    "the sheaf @xmath16 is the subsheaf of the sheaf  @xmath17 of differential operators which is locally generated over @xmath18 by the vector fields  @xmath19 .",
    "objects of @xmath5 are filtered objects of the category of triples @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are holonomic @xmath16-modules and @xmath22 is a @xmath23-sesquilinear pairing @xmath24 ( here , @xmath23 is the anti - holomorphic involution @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the sheaf of distributions on @xmath27 which are continuous on @xmath14 ,  [ sec : introi ] and footnote [ footnote : nonintegrable ] ) .",
    "there is a natural exact functor @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 .",
    "the category @xmath8 of _ integrable _ objects and morphisms plays an important intermediate role in what follows .",
    "the @xmath16-modules underlying the objects in this category are equipped with a compatible action of @xmath30 and the pairing is supposed to be compatible with it .",
    "the morphisms in this category are defined as are the morphisms in @xmath5 , with the supplementary condition that they are compatible with the @xmath30-action .",
    "the rescaling operation has been defined in the framework of terp structures in @xcite .",
    "this rescaling operation is the main ingredient in order to define the category @xmath31 .",
    "however , before doing so , we need to modify the presentation of objects in @xmath8 : while it is easy to define the rescaling of an integrable @xmath16-module , the pairing is not rescalable , since it is defined only on @xmath27 , and the rescaling operation changes  @xmath13 to  @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "we are therefore led to give another description of an object in @xmath8 , where the pairing @xmath34 is now @xmath35-sesquilinear ( @xmath36 ) and is defined on @xmath37 and not only on @xmath27 .",
    "the purpose of part [ part:1 ] , which is essential for simply giving the definition of the rescaling operation , is to define this category @xmath38 and to show the equivalence @xmath39 .",
    "( note that the integrability property is important and we can not argue without it . )",
    "the rescaling operation is defined for any integrable @xmath35-triple @xmath40 , and it is a strong condition that , starting from an object of @xmath38 , for any @xmath33 the @xmath41-rescaled object remains an integrable mixed twistor @xmath0-module . in the pure case , and when @xmath4 is a point , this is a condition similar to the notion of `` sabbah orbit '' as defined in @xcite .",
    "even stronger is the condition that the rescaled object extends as a mixed twistor @xmath0-module on the affine line with coordinate @xmath42 , which imposes a good behaviour of the rescaled objects when @xmath43 ( in the case of a `` sabbah orbit '' , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.7.3 ) ) .",
    "this leads to the category @xmath31 , the objects of which can then be endowed with an irregular hodge filtration . however",
    ", a supplementary property is needed in order to ensure a good behaviour of the irregular hodge filtration by projective push - forward and smooth pull - back , that we call a grading property , which actually produces the category @xmath10 .",
    "we usually denote an object of @xmath44 as @xmath45 , but we sometimes shorten the notation as @xmath46 , when the context is clear .",
    "the category @xmath38 comes equipped with standard functors which are compatible with those defined for @xmath8 in @xcite , as shown in part [ part:1 ] :    * the duality functor @xmath47 . * for a projective morphism @xmath48 between smooth complex manifolds , the push - forward functors @xmath49 . * for a smooth morphism @xmath50 , the pull - back functor @xmath51 . *",
