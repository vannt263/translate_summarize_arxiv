    "in the pioneering work of kaplan and nelson @xcite , it was demonstrated within the @xmath1 chiral perturbation theory that antikaon ( @xmath0 meson ) condensation might be possible in dense baryonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions as well as in neutron stars .",
    "the underlying idea is that the bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0 mesons is driven by the strongly attractive @xmath0-nucleon interaction .",
    "consequently , the attractive antikaon - nucleon interaction reduces the effective mass ( @xmath2 ) and in - medium energy ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath0 mesons . the @xmath4-wave @xmath0 condensation sets in when @xmath3 equals to the @xmath0 chemical potential @xmath5 which , in turn , is equal to the electron chemical potential @xmath6 for neutron ( neutrino - free ) star matter in @xmath7 equilibrium . the threshold density for @xmath0 condensation which sensitively depends on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and the strength of the attractive antikaon optical potential depth , is about @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "there was considerable interest in the study of the properties of kaons ( @xmath10 ) and antikaons ( @xmath11 ) in dense nuclear matter as well as neutron star matter after the work of kaplan and nelson .",
    "antikaon condensation in neutron star interior was studied in great details in the chiral perturbation theory @xcite as well as meson exchange model @xcite .",
    "the net effect of @xmath0 condensation in neutron star matter is to soften the eos leading to a smaller maximum mass neutron star than that of the case without the condensate .",
    "there is a growing interplay between the physics of dense matter formed in heavy ion collisions and the physics of neutron stars .",
    "the study of dense matter in future experiments at fair in gsi might reveal many new and interesting results .",
    "it would be possible to produce matter with baryon density a few times normal nuclear matter density and temperature a few tens of mev at fair . under these circumstances",

    "has to investigate antikaon condensation at finite temperature .",
    "antikaon condensation at finite temperature was already studied in connection with neutron @xcite and protoneutron ( newly born and neutrino trapped ) stars @xcite .",
    "these studies were either related to dynamical evolution of the condensation or metastability of protoneutron stars",
    ". however , the melting of antikaon condensate in nuclear matter is so far not looked into .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the critical temperature of @xmath0 condensation in neutron star matter .",
    "further , we wish to construct a phase diagram of nuclear matter involving @xmath0 condensate .",

    "temperature increases with baryon density for both cases .",
    "the temperature for @xmath71 falls below that of @xmath72 mev case due to the early onset of @xmath0 condensation in the former case .    at zero temperature ,",

    "the total density of ( anti)kaons is given by the solid line .",
    "the thermal ( anti)kaons are populated well before the threshold of the condensate .",
    "as soon as the condensation sets in , the density of @xmath0 mesons takes over the thermal contribution .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the onset of antikaon condensation for a particular value of @xmath73 is shifted to higher density for larger value of @xmath74 .",
    "now we focus on the determination of critical temperature ( @xmath75 ) for antikaon condensation .",
    "the condensate does not exist for temperatures @xmath76 .",
    "the density of @xmath0 mesons in the condensate is a function of baryon density and temperature .",
    "we find that the density of antikaons in the condensate increases with baryon density and temperature as it is evident from figures 1 and 2 .",

    ", the density of antikaons drops with increasing temperature and the condensate melts down at certain temperature which is defined as the critical temperature of the condensation .",

    "similar investigation is done for @xmath72 mev and different fixed baryon densities .",
    "these results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "3 we obtain the same feature of the critical temperature as a function of baryon density for @xmath72 mev .",
    "however , the comparison of same fixed baryon density curve , for example 4@xmath9 in figures 3 and 4 , shows that the critical temperature for @xmath72 mev is much smaller than that of @xmath71 mev case .",
    "it is to be noted here that the hot neutron star after trapped neutrinos are emitted has a maximum entropy per baryon @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "however , we have obtained large values of temperatures for certain fixed baryon densities in figures 3 and 4 which correspond to @xmath80 . such high temperature or",
    "the corresponding entropy per baryon might not be relevant for a protoneutron star but it could be important for dense matter formed in heavy ion experiments in upcoming accelerator facilities .",
    "entropy per baryon is plotted with temperature for @xmath81 mev in fig . 5 and fig .",
    "6 respectively .",
    "each curve in both figures corresponds to a fixed value of baryon density .",
    "the end point of each curve in fig . 5 and fig . 6 indicates the corresponding critical temperature as it is obtained in fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 respectively . for @xmath71 mev , we vary entropy per baryon from @xmath82 0 to 5.5 to get critical temperatures whereas we use @xmath82 0 to 2.75 for the calculation with @xmath72 mev .",
    "now we know the critical temperature as a function of baryon density .",
    "it is straight forward to construct a phase diagram of nuclear matter with @xmath0 condensate .",
    "figure 7 displays temperature versus baryon density for @xmath7 equilibrated nuclear matter with the antikaon condensate .",
    "the critical temperature lines for @xmath71 mev ( solid line ) and @xmath72 mev ( dashed line ) separate two phases .",
    "the condensed phase exists below the critical temperature lines and the nuclear matter phase above them .",
    "similarly a phase diagram with antikaon condensate could be constructed for heavy ion collisions which might be probed in future experiments at fair , gsi .",
    "it is to be noted that the attractive antikaon - nucleon interaction drives antikaon condensation in neutron stars as well as heavy ion collisions .",
    "heavy ion collisions in compressed baryon matter ( cbm ) experiment in fair might produce matter with density a few times normal nuclear matter density and temperature a few tens of mev .",
    "such a scenario would be relevant for medium modification of the mass and energy of @xmath0 meson due to attractive nucleon - antikaon interaction @xcite .",
    "consequently , it might lead to @xmath0 condensate at finite temperature .",
    "the formation of an antikaon condensate in heavy ion collisions might lead to enhanced production of strange hadrons @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the critical temperature of @xmath0 condensation in @xmath7 equilibrated nuclear matter for antikaon optical potential depths @xmath69 mev within the framework of field theoretical models .",
    "critical temperature of antikaon condensation increases with baryon density .",
    "for the same baryon density , the critical temperature is larger in case of @xmath71 mev than that of @xmath72 mev .",
    "we construct the phase diagram of @xmath7 equilibrated nuclear matter with @xmath0 condensate .",
