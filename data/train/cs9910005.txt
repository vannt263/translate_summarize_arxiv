    "it follows essentially by the technique of the _ proof _ of ( * ? ? ?",

    "so , for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 we have @xmath260 , and thus we have the following corollary .",
    "[ c : new - dshandle ] let @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "if @xmath263 , then @xmath264 .",
    "we note the strength of this collapse .",
    "the conclusion obtains a collapse of the hierarchy to a level that is generally thought to be lower ( a priori ) than the level of either of the classes whose equality was assumed in the hypothesis .",
    "that is , this is an actual _ downward _ translation of equality , in contrast with the far more common behavior of upward translation of equality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , for examples and discussion ) .",
    "we now can prove theorem  [ t : differ ] .",
    "_ proof of theorem  [ t : differ ] . _",
    "suppose that @xmath253 and that ( without loss of generality in light of corollary  [ c : sig ] ) @xmath18 and @xmath265 .",
    "suppose that either @xmath266 or @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "first note that if @xmath266 , then @xmath269 . since @xmath253",
    ", it follows immediately that @xmath270 .",
    "so suppose that @xmath271 and @xmath272 . then @xmath273 .",
    "if @xmath262 , then @xmath274 by corollary  [ c : new - dshandle ] .",

    "then the class of sets that 2-truth - table reduce to @xmath21 sets equals the class of sets that 2-turing reduce to @xmath21 sets , which itself is well - known  ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) to imply that  @xmath276 collapses .",
    "so it is clear from theorem  [ t : differ ] that query order classes do not equal standard `` bounded query '' classes but rather form new intermediate levels in the polynomial hierarchy , unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses ( see figure  [ f : inc ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning some very recent related work that was inspired by the present paper . in this paper ,",
    "our basic model is of ordered access to two sets .",
    "wagner  @xcite and beigel and chang  @xcite build on the work of the current paper by studying machines that have ordered access to truth - table groups of queries and they show that in that case too order does not matter .",
    "we consider this work to be important and interesting , and to broaden the range of models to which the questions of this paper can be applied .",
    "we also mention that the work is not strictly stronger than our work as beigel and chang discuss only sets from the polynomial hierarchy and wagner has somewhat different hypotheses than we do on the classes involved , especially regarding our intermediate results that separate out exactly what hypotheses imply what conclusions . also , in contrast to the key hierarchy collapse result of the present paper , which guarantees and proves a downward translation of equality , the analogous hierarchy collapses of those papers obtain from weaker hypotheses weaker collapses ( namely , the collapse results of those papers related to query - order - based language classes merely assert that the hierarchy collapses , and they rely either on the upward - equality - translation work of selivanov or make no specific collapse - level claim at all ) .",
    "finally , as we will discuss later in more detail , the work of section  [ s : other - base ] applies fully to the cases discussed in these papers . a survey paper by hemaspaandra et al .",
    "@xcite provides a detailed overview of query order .",
    "we show that a wide variety of classes inherit all order exchanges that hold for @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if @xmath277 then @xmath278 .",
    "thus order exchanges proven for p  such as those of section  [ subs : orderex ] of this paper and those of hemaspaandra , hempel , and wechsung  @xcite  can immediately be applied to many other classes .",
    "we prove our result in a very general form , and then state some corollaries and applications to make the meaning of the theorem more concrete . for classes @xmath279 and @xmath280 for which relativization has been defined",
    ", we say that @xmath279 is robustly contained in @xmath280 if , for each @xmath41 , @xmath281 .",
    "@xmath282}$ ] will mean that each path of the base machine makes at most one call to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath283 will mean that each path of the base machine makes at most one call to @xmath284 followed by at most one call to @xmath285 .",
    "the important point to note is that essentially all standard complexity classes within the realm of potentially feasible computation ( classes from  p to  pspace ) are sane . in particular , bringing work of bovet , crescenzi , and silvestri into notational analogy with more recent terminology , let us say that a relativizable complexity class @xmath160 is leaf - definable if @xmath160 `` admits a c - class representation '' in the formal sense ( which we will not repeat here ) defined by bovet , crescenzi , and silvestri  ( @xcite , see also  @xcite ) and the representation itself holds also in all relativized worlds ( under the natural extension of their work to ordered oracle access , following exactly their discussion of relativization ) .",
    "bovet , crescenzi , and silvestri  @xcite prove that essentially all standard classes in the realm of potentially feasible computation `` admit c - class representations , '' they observe that these representations all relativize , and we comment that their observation clearly holds also for ordered access .",
    "the reason this is relevant is that it is easy to see that all leaf - definable classes are sane .",
    "thus , the following result says that essentially all standard complexity classes inherit every order exchange possessed by  p.    [ t : very - general - generalizedtosane ] let @xmath279 and @xmath280 be sane complexity classes , and let @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath287 , and @xmath288 be complexity classes .",
    "if @xmath279 is robustly contained in @xmath280 and @xmath289 , then @xmath290    * proof:*the theorem holds via the following inclusion chain : @xmath291 } \\stackrel{b}{\\subseteq }   { \\cal d}_1^{({{\\rm p}}^{{\\cal c}_3 : { \\cal c}_4})[1 ] } \\stackrel{c}{\\subseteq }   { \\cal d}_2^{({{\\rm p}}^{{\\cal c}_3 : { \\cal c}_4})[1 ] } \\stackrel{d}{\\subseteq }   { \\cal d}_2^{{\\cal c}_3 :   { \\cal c}_4}.\\ ] ] inclusion ( b ) follows from the assumption that @xmath289 and inclusion ( c ) follows from the assumption that @xmath279 is robustly contained in @xmath292 .",
    "inclusions ( a ) and",
    "( d ) hold via the fact that the classes are sane .",
    "we give some examples of how this can be applied .",
    "@xmath295 will denote the @xmath15th level of the boolean hierarchy  @xcite , and as is standard dp  @xcite denotes the second level of the boolean hierarchy .",
    "note that bovet , crescenzi , and silvestri  @xcite have proven that bpp , up , and pp are leaf - definable classes .",
    "thus , these classes are sane .      parts  [ exa ] and  [ exb ] of the example hold due to corollary  [ c : general ] in light of  @xcite , which proves that the class of languages computable via a polynomial - time machine given one query to the @xmath15th level of the boolean hierarchy followed by one query to the @xmath16th level of the boolean hierarchy equals @xmath299 if @xmath15 is even and @xmath16 is odd , and equals @xmath300 otherwise , where @xmath301 equals the class of languages that @xmath302-truth - table reduce to  np sets . part  [ exc ] follows , as an application of corollary  [ c : general ] , from corollary  [ c : sig ] .",
    "though theorem  [ t : very - general - generalizedtosane ] says that _ all _ order exchanges of p  apply to essentially all standard complexity classes , it of course remains possible that certain path - based classes may possess additional order exchanges .",
    "for example , though section  [ subs : differ ] showed that p  ordered query classes create new intermediate polynomial hierarchy levels unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses , this clearly is not the case for np   or @xmath21 .",
    "* proof:*without loss of generality , suppose @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath305}$ ] is clear in light of the quantifier characterization of the levels of the polynomial hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath306 } \\subseteq { ( { { \\rm \\sigma}_i^p})}^{{{\\rm \\sigma}_j^p}:{{\\rm \\sigma}_k^p } }   \\subseteq { ( { { \\rm \\sigma}_i^p})}^{{{\\rm \\sigma}_k^p } } = \\sigma_{i+k}^p$ ] and similarly @xmath306 } \\subseteq { ( { { \\rm \\sigma}_i^p})}^{{{\\rm \\sigma}_k^p}:{{\\rm \\sigma}_j^p } }   \\subseteq { ( { { \\rm \\sigma}_i^p})}^{{{\\rm \\sigma}_k^p}}= \\sigma_{i+k}^p$ ] .",
    "relatedly , classes may also trivially exhibit certain equalities based on class - specific features .",
    "for example , it follows trivially from @xmath307 and the ( nontrivial ) result of fortnow and reingold  @xcite regarding the @xmath308 closure of pp  that @xmath309 .    finally , as we mentioned earlier , other papers have suggested varying the model of this paper to include multiple queries to many oracles in various patterns of truth - table and ordered access .",
    "we note that the approach of this section applies completely to such cases ( modifying the definitions of sanity and leaf - definability to reflect whatever access model one is using ) .",
