    "since the pioneering work of @xcite stars have been used to trace the chemical evolution of the milky way and other galaxies . due to their long lifetimes ,",
    "cool stars ( of spectral types f to k ) are particularly suited for studying the build - up of elements over the course of the past 12 - 14gyr .",
    "one of the basic assumptions made in this field of study is that the chemical composition in the atmospheric layers of such stars is representative of the gas out of which the stars once formed . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that there are no processes that substantially alter the chemical composition at the surface with time .",
    "however , stars are dynamical systems and various processes ( e.g. , convection and diffusion ) can lead to an exchange of material between the star s interior and its atmosphere .    from the 1970ies , such processes have indeed been observed .",
    "for example , studies of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundances in giants stars @xcite show clear signs of mixing with material processed in the stellar core , in qualitative agreement with expectations from stellar structure and evolution @xcite . in globular clusters , anti - correlations between certain elements ( e.g.  o - na ) were also identified among giant stars @xcite .",
    "it was , however , initially unclear whether these are caused by internal mixing processes or external pollution from an earlier generation of more massive stars . with the advent of 8m - class telescopes during the 1990ies , these anti - correlations could be traced in unevolved ( turnoff - point ) stars @xcite clearly favouring the external - pollution scenario .    beyond such element - specific effects , models of stellar evolution",
    "predict general variations of the atmospheric abundances of elements in unevolved stars on long timescales .",
    "atomic diffusion is expected to be at work in the sun @xcite , but larger effects are expected in warm metal - poor stars , as they are generally older and their convective envelopes are thinner .",
    "in contrast , giant stars are predicted not to show this effect , as their deep outer convection zones restore the original composition in their atmospheres . from this point of view ,",
    "giant stars are to be preferred as probes of chemical evolution .",
    "however , their atmospheric structures may be more poorly known and certain ( fragile ) elements ( e.g. , the light elements li , be and b ) can only be studied in near - main - sequence stars .    while early models predicted abundance reductions as large as a factor of ten @xcite ,",
    "current models treating atomic diffusion ( including radiative acceleration ) and mixing below the convection zone suggest abundance effects smaller than a factor of two ( see figure  [ predictions ] ) .",
    "effects of this size are hard to trace observationally .",
    "one needs to compare abundances in unevolved and evolved stars all drawn from the same stellar population .",
    "globular clusters of the galactic halo offer adequate laboratories to put observational constraints on this theoretical expectation .",
    "star with [ fe / h]=@xmath12 that reaches the top after 13.5gyr .",
    "different symbols / line styles represent different models treating : atomic diffusion including radiative acceleration @xmath2 ( bullets ) ; atomic diffusion without radiative acceleration ( rhombi ) ; atomic diffusion including radiative acceleration and turbulent mixing t6.0 ( triangles / full line ) ; atomic diffusion without radiative acceleration , but with turbulent mixing t6.0 ( triangles / dashed line ) . for details , see  [ compdiff ] and @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite used the large light - collecting area of the keck telescope to investigate the chemical composition of stars at the turnoff point ( hereafter top ) of m92 .",
    "they note `` possible evidence for [ fe / h ] differences within m92 '' , but the design of their study ( only observing top stars ) and the moderate data quality ( signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios between 10 and 40 ) precluded firm conclusions .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter g01 ) were the first to perform a joint analysis of stars at the top and the base of the red - giant branch ( hereafter brgb ) in two nearby globular clusters , ngc6397 and ngc6752 , using uves on the vlt .",
    "while the main aim of their study was a detailed investigation of the anti - correlations discussed above , they found no indication of variations in iron abundances between the top and the brgb stars .    due to the fundamental importance of this result for cosmochemical studies ( e.g. , the interpretation of stellar lithium abundances in the framework of big - bang nucleosynthesis ) , we started to re - investigate the data of g01 in 2003 .",
    "data - reduction problems in the effective - temperature determination were uncovered which , once corrected for , leave room for a decrease of 20% in iron abundance ( 0.1 dex in log(fe ) ) due to atomic diffusion between these two groups of stars @xcite .",
    "this finding prompted us to obtain new data on ngc6397 in early 2005 .",
    "results concerning lithium were published in @xcite , here we give a full account of the analysis .",
    "this article is organized in the following way : in  2 , the observations and data - reduction techniques are discussed .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric stellar - parameter determinations and spectroscopic abundance analyses are presented in  3 . in  4 , the abundance trends are compared with predictions from stellar evolution models including diffusion .",
    "finally , in   5 and 6 the results are put into astrophysical context and are summarized .",
    "the photometric data on which our observations are based have been obtained with the danish 1.54 m telescope on la silla , chile .",
    "strmgren @xmath3 data were obtained in may 1997 during a two - week observing run and additional @xmath4 data were obtained in 2005 .",
    "for all these imaging data the dfosc instrument was used .",
    "all photometric reductions were carried out using the suite of programs developed by peter stetson @xcite .",
    "the procedures for standard - star observations and photometric calibration of the @xmath3 photometry employed here are identical to those described in @xcite and the reader is referred to these papers for further details .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometric zero points for @xmath5 are of the order 001 , as found in previous studies .    for the @xmath4 data we did not observe standard stars since",
    "p.  stetson has provided a library of secondary standards through the cadc www pages which are present in our field .",
    "we therefore adopted the stars from his list for calibrating the broad - band photometry , and thus these stars act as local standards in each frame .",

    "the median and maximum number of observations are given for each filter in table [ uvby ] .",
    "for @xmath4 we obtained 3 exposures in each filter .",
    "our @xmath3 photometric data were also used to select the spectroscopic targets and since observations are carried out with the fibre - fed multi - object spectrograph flames accurate astrometry was needed . for this we used the _",
    "ucac2 _ catalog at vizier .",
    "dfosc is a focal reducer which may have distortion that could affect the astrometric precision .",
    "we therefore calibrated each image separately , removed the distortion and subsequently combined all the images to obtain the astrometry for each target .",
    "the astrometric precision is of the order 010 for individual stars .",
    "the stars , their designations and j2000 positions are given in table [ table : phot ] .",
    "the flames instrument @xcite has a combined mode which allows the simultaneous observation of up to eight objects with uves and 130 objects with giraffe - medusa .",
    "here we only report on the observations with flames - uves , the analysis of the giraffe - medusa data will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( lind et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the total exposure time of @xmath020.5h was split between three groups of stars , top , brgb and rgb stars ( see figure [ cmd ] and table [ obs ] ) .",
    "two stars in the middle of the subgiant branch ( hereafter sgb stars ) were always observed in conjunction with the other groups of stars . with five to six stars in each group ,",
    "this left one fibre to monitor the sky background .",
    "we re - observed some of the stars observed by g01 , three in each of the two groups ( top and brgb ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the flames - uves spectra is 48006800 , with a small ccd gap around 5800 .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath10=47000 .",
    "as seen in table  [ obs ] , the peak s / n per pixel varies between 56 ( top star 507433 ) and 151 ( rgb star 11093 ) , while the average s / n in each group is more homogeneous and varies between 66 ( top group ) and 112 ( sgb / rgb group ) .",
    "these values were computed from the rather line - free region around 5725  after rebinning by a factor of two ( the rebinning does not degrade the resolution , as one resolution element consists of five pixels ) .",
    "the s / n remains roughly constant redward of 5725 , while it gradually degrades ( by @xmath11 20% ) towards the blue end of the spectrum at 4800 . in total ,",
    "the s / n for the rgb stars is in line with the expectations from the flames - uves exposure - time calculator , while it falls short for the top stars by about 50% .",
    "at least in part this can be attributed to the sky correction which inevitably adds noise .",
    "for comparison , the five top stars observed with uves in slit mode by g01 had a total integration time of 20h achieving s / n ratios between 60 and 90 at a resolving power of @xmath10=40000 . with flames - uves , we thus profit from a significant multiplexing advantage ( at the dispense of wavelength coverage in the blue ) .",
    "barycentric radial velocities were computed from radial - velocity measurements using several strong mgi and fei lines .",
    "as shown in table  [ obs ] , barycentric radial velocities of individual stars scatter around a mean value of 17.5km / s .",
    "this compares well with the mean radial velocity for ngc 6397 of 18.9km / s given by @xcite . with typical velocity dispersions of 5 - 10km /",
    "s for old globular clusters , all stars are found to be kinematic cluster members .",

    "[ halpha ] , this is not the case when uves is used as a slit spectrograph : the blaze removal and subsequent order merging as implemented in the uves pipeline leave significant residuals from which the analysis by g01 was shown to suffer @xcite .    the individual exposures are corrected for fibre - to - fibre throughput and the sky as monitored by one fibre is subtracted .",

    "we perform independent photometric and spectroscopic analyses to derive the fundamental stellar parameters @xmath21 and log @xmath22 .",
    "while it is desirable to achieve stellar parameters as free of systematic errors as possible , the detection of abundance differences between groups of stars basically requires stellar - parameter _ differences _ that are free of systematic effects .",
    "thus , for abundances derived from minority species like lii , mgi and fei , @xmath23=@xmath21(top ) @xmath1 @xmath21(rgb ) is the most pertinent quantity , while majority species like tiii , feii and baii react most sensitively to @xmath24 = log  @xmath22(top ) @xmath1 log @xmath22(rgb ) .",
    "apart from providing the spectroscopic targets for our observations , the photometry can also be used to estimate the basic stellar parameters , such as effective temperature and surface gravity independently of the spectroscopic analysis . here",
    "we describe the approach used to estimate these quantities .",
    "it was found that our targets showed some scatter around the observed cluster sequences , most likely due to crowding effects and observational errors in the photometry . at the top , duplicity may play a role . in order to reduce this effect , we derived mean cluster fiducial sequences by first cleaning the photometry lists based on photometric quality ( the daophot _ sharp _ parameter ) and location in the cluster ( crowding ) .",
    "we then divided the @xmath12 magnitudes into 022 bins and for each of these bins the _ same _ stars were averaged ( using robust estimation routines from the astrolib library ) for each filter ( @xmath25 ) to produce mean fiducial points for each band .    when deriving effective temperatures based on photometry we use colour indices , and to ensure that these properly represent the cluster sequence we overplotted the fiducial points on the cluster colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for each colour - magnitude combination employed , for example a @xmath26 diagram .",
    "we estimate that the error in the colour difference between the rgb and the cluster top is less than 001 and we adopt this as our uncertainty estimate of this quantity .",
    "armed with the fiducial sequences we proceed to derive fiducial colours for our target stars by interpolating their colour in the fiducial sequence at their observed @xmath12 magnitude .",
    "this approach effectively removes the star - to - star spread at any given magnitude and is the best we can do since our @xmath12 magnitudes are the best calibrated and have the highest number of observations per star .      to estimate the effective temperatures we use the empirical colour calibrations by alonso et al .",

    "such calibrations had not been derived by either alonso et al .  or",
    "ramrez & melndez we asked them to derive new calibrations for different colour combinations and then used these ( a.a . and i.r .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we present the new calibrations in table [ photcalib ] in the form of coefficients for the analytic formulae given in the respective original papers by alonso et al .",
    "amd ramrez & melndez .    before applying the colour - temperature calibrations",
    "we discuss the cluster reddening since the calibrations employ the reddening - corrected colours .",
    "ngc 6397 has a non - negligible reddening and several estimates are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a value of e(@xmath29)@xmath30 , a value very similar to the one derived by g01 .",
    "to correct for reddening for the other photometric bands employed here , we use the coefficients given in table 1 of ramirez & melendez ( 2005 ) .    for each target star",
    "we then derived effective temperatures based on the available colours .",
    "we calculated each star s effective temperature using both the dwarf- and giant - star calibrations .",
    "the resulting effective temperatures for each target are given in table [ table : phot ] .",
    "for the calibrations used we find that the @xmath31 calibration has a sensitivity of 22k and 38k per 001 change in @xmath31 for giants and turnoff stars at [ fe / h]@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath33 colour shows approximately the same sensitivity , i.e. , with changes of around 20k and 40k for the giant and dwarf calibrations , respectively .",
    "for a change of @xmath170.1dex in [ fe / h ] the effective temperature changes by @xmath1720k .",
    "we have used a metallicity of @xmath12.0 throughout for calculating effective temperatures , thus not making any implicit assumption about the existence of atomic diffusion .    as presented in table [",
    "table : phot ] , the @xmath23 values vary between 906k ( @xmath29 ) and 1108k ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the other two calibrations both point to a @xmath23 close to 1100k , indicating that @xmath29 may underestimate the effective - temperature differences between top and rgb stars .",
    "larger @xmath23 values seem possible based on 2mass @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 colours .",
    "however , at the magnitudes of top stars in ngc 6397 , the 2mass magnitudes have substantial uncertainties .",
    "more accurate infrared photometry would be desirable to reach the accuracy needed for studies like these .",
    "surface gravities were derived from the usual relation between log @xmath22 and the luminosity , temperature and mass of the observed stars .",
    "we assumed a mass of 0.779m@xmath38 for the top stars and 0.792m@xmath38 for the rgb stars based on 13.5gyr isochrones of @xcite .",
    "this is an upper limit for the age of ngc 6397 and the masses are therefore lower limits .",
    "the bias on the surface gravities introduced by these assumptions is , however , insignificant .    in order to determine the luminosity of the stars",

    "the error in the determination of the effective temperature is the dominant error source in the determination of the log @xmath22 _ differences_. an error of 50k for the effective - temperature difference translates into a change of 0.015dex in @xmath24 . for the calculation of the absolute surface gravities a value of @xmath40",

    "while the self - broadening theory of @xcite describes the neutral - particle interaction more realistically , the impact on the effective temperatures is small ( 20 - 40k , as shown by test calculations with marcs ) when the analysis is done differentially to the sun .",
    "this is because the improved self - broadening theory produces stronger theoretical profiles both for the sun and metal - poor stars analysed here .",
    "@xmath23 is affected by 20k ( @xmath490.2% ) which is not significant for our conclusions .",
    "this also means that broadening - theory differences can not explain the effective - temperature differences between g01 and this study .",
    "a direct comparison of theoretical profiles ( r.  gratton , priv . comm . 2005 ) indicated that differences in the implementation ( model atmosphere , broadening etc . )",
    "are of the order of 50k .",
    "the effective - temperature determination is done in two steps : firstly , the spectral region of h@xmath20 is normalized using continuum points at least @xmath1750  away from the line centre .",
    "these points are linearly interpolated across the h@xmath20 profile to obtain a normalized spectrum . secondly",
    ", the normalized h@xmath20 profile is compared with theoretical profiles by eye to achieve a good overall agreement between theory and observation . the core of h@xmath20 ( the innermost @xmath17 2 , residual flux below 0.75 ) is disregarded .",
    "figure [ halpha ] shows the spectrum of top 507433 ( g01 s target 201432 ) around h@xmath20 .",
    "the uves spectrum ( top , kindly made available by e.  carretta ) shows echelle - blaze and order - merging residuals with an amplitude of @xmath172% which limit the effective - temperature determination to an accuracy of @xmath17200k .",
    "however , the error associated with the residual order pattern is likely to have a systematic effect on the effective - temperature determination , as the balmer - line wings are systematically suppressed ( h@xmath20 falls into the convex part of this pattern ) .",
    "thus , as overestimation of @xmath21 by as much as 200k appears possible @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the flames - uves spectrum ( middle ) of the same star which does not seem to suffer from these instrumental artefacts .",
    "an effective temperature of 6260k is derived , a value that also finds support from the analysis of the giraffe - medusa spectrum ( bottom , @xmath10=29000 , fsr @xmath50 200 ) of this star ( lind et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . a careful re - analysis of the archival data of g01 for this star using the reduce software package @xcite pointed towards an effective temperature of @xmath21=6230k , again in line with the new spectra obtained .",
    "we note that the problems encountered with the uves spectra have a far smaller influence on the effective - temperature determination of the brgb ( and rgb ) stars , as their balmer - line profiles are significantly narrower .",
    "if we assume an uncertainty for deriving @xmath21 for an individual star to be 200k , then @xmath23(top @xmath1 rgb ) turns out to be 1124k @xmath17 120k ( see table  [ stellparam ] ) .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the majority of the photometric indices presented in table  [ table : phot ] and discussed above .",
    "the iron ionization equilibrium is used to constrain log@xmath22 via the requirement that fei and feii lines show the same mean abundance .",
    "fei is modelled in non - lte , using the photo - ionization cross - sections computed by @xcite , modelling in detail the uv fluxes and treating inelastic collisions with hydrogen according to @xcite and @xcite with a scaling factor of 3 ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) . at the same time , the microturbulence is derived by requiring that fei and feii line abundances show no trend with line strength .",
    "the iron ionization equilibrium is considered as established if the difference in the mean abundances derived from fei and feii is 0.01dex or less .",
    "this means that we determine log@xmath22 values with an accuracy of 0.03dex .",
    "it is worth noting that overionization in fei is found to be only 0.030.05dex for all stars",
    "( this is because the calibrated non - lte model employs rather efficient hydrogen collisions ) .",
    "this means that the absolute log@xmath22 values are raised by about 0.1dex for all stars compared to the lte case .",
    "there are practically no differential non - lte effects . in this sense ,",
    "our conclusions are not affected by particular choices as regards the underlying line - formation theory .",
    "@xmath24 is determined to be 1.33 @xmath17 0.12 ( assuming an uncertainty of 0.2dex in log @xmath22 for the individual star , see table  [ stellparam ] ) .",
    "this compares very favourably with the photometric estimates based on @xmath51 of @xmath42=1.38 @xmath17 0.05 .",
    "we note that some authors find smaller microturbulence values for top stars .",
    "for example , g01 assign a common microturbulence of @xmath43=1.32km / s to their top stars . with a mean @xmath43 of 2km / s ,",
    "our top - star analyses give systematically higher values .",
    "however , these values are only marginally ( 0.2km / s ) higher than value derived for local top star hd 84937 ( @xmath21=6350k , log @xmath22=4.0 , [ fe / h]=@xmath12.16 , @xmath43=1.8km / s ) using the same methodology ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the higher microturbulence values could be caused by the line selection which in turn is constrained by the wavelength coverage and the s / n . to minimize the impact of this parameter on the overall analysis",

    "all these values are fully compatible with the spectroscopic value of 1.33 @xmath17 0.12 .",

    "however , none of these has an effective temperature above 6100k . as the problems with blaze residuals and order merging worsen towards hotter effective temperatures ( broader balmer line profiles ) , this poor coverage in @xmath21 may have caused the systematic effects on the top - star effective temperatures to go undetected . ]",

    ", the gravity difference also turns out to be lower than that derived by g01 . at 0.1dex ,",
    "the difference is , however , not significant .",
    "in addition to the re - analyses of g01 stars , we also analyse one of the top stars observed by @xcite .",
    "this star ( a2084 ) has the same @xmath12 magnitude as ngc 6397/12318 .",
    "based on the uves pipeline output ( kindly made available by f.  thvenin ) , we confirm the stellar parameters and iron abundance derived by @xcite to within @xmath46 measurement uncertainties : @xmath21 = 6250k @xmath17 200k , log @xmath22 = 4.0 @xmath17 0.2 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath12.27 @xmath17 0.1 , @xmath43 = 1.7km / s @xmath17 0.2km / s .",
    "this indicates once more that our top - star effective temperatures are essentially correct .",
    "it may seem that one has a great variety of elements to choose from when investigating atomic - diffusion predictions like those shown in figure  [ predictions ] .",
    "however , various groups of elements are not suited for testing such predictions by comparing their abundances in unevolved and evolved globular - cluster stars .",
    "helium is unobservable in these cool stars .",
    "lithium can be observed in top stars , but is significantly processed in rgb stars .",
    "beryllium and boron require near - uv spectroscopy and suffer from the same type of processing as lithium .",
    "carbon and nitrogen in rgb stars may rather reflect the contamination of the atmosphere with material processed in the stellar core .",
    "oxygen , sodium , magnesium and aluminium suffer from the anti - correlations discussed in the introduction .",
    "we are then left with elements like silicon , sulphur , calcium , titanium and iron - group elements ( no predictions currently exist for elements heavier than nickel ) .    according to figure  [ predictions ] , a clear signature of atomic diffusion and mixing would be steep trends ( @xmath54(x ) = @xmath55(x)@xmath56(x)@xmath57 = 0.2 ) in silicon , rather flat trends ( @xmath54(x ) = 0.1 ) in calcium and titanium and intermediate trends ( @xmath54(x ) = 0.15 ) in iron - group elements .",
    "once the stellar parameters , and in particular stellar - parameter differences , are determined it is a straightforward task to derive abundances , and potential abundance differences , for various elements .",
    "as abundance differences are a differential indicator , the exact choice of atomic data for a given line is not critical .",
    "this is why we do not tabulate the line data in detail ( the lines used are specified in appendix a ) . however",
    ", even differential indicators may be affected by departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , as excitation , ionization and collisions are inherently different in dwarf and giant stars .",
    "we therefore made an effort to model as many elements as possible using non - lte line formation : mgi is modelled following @xcite , cai following @xcite , fei following @xcite and baii following @xcite .",
    "lines arising from transition in tiii and feii are believed to be formed under near - lte conditions ; these species constitute the dominant ionization stages of the respective element . the case of lii",
    "is discussed in section  [ lithium ] .",
    "after co - adding the spectra within each group of stars , lines as weak as 20m  could easily be measured in the top stars .",
    "such lines ( depending on the line - specific atomic data ) have line strengths of 60 - 70m  in the rgb stars .",
    "the analysis is then insensitive to @xmath58 , but has some sensitivity to @xmath59 . in table",
    "[ table : errors ] , the sensitivity of a few representative lines to variations in stellar parameters ( including microturbulence ) is given .",

    "the atomic - diffusion models were computed as described in @xcite and references therein for the metallicity of ngc  6397 .",

    "the detailed treatment of atomic diffusion is described in @xcite and the radiative accelerations are from @xcite with corrections for redistribution from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "convection and semi - convection are modelled as diffusive processes as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main free parameter in these calculations is the efficiency of ( turbulent ) mixing below the outer convection zone . as discussed in @xcite , this extra ingredient",
    "is needed to meet the constraints imposed by the observations of @xmath60li in warm halo stars : a thin and flat plateau can only be retained in the presence of diffusion , if extra mixing is introduced into the models .",
    "as no parameter - free physical description of turbulent mixing is available , it is introduced into the stellar - evolution models in an ad - hoc manner .",
    "the turbulent diffusion coefficient , @xmath61 , is linked to the atomic - diffusion coefficient of he at a reference temperature @xmath62 and is chosen to vary with density @xmath63 to the inverse third power : @xmath64 there are two tunable parameters in this formula , the proportionality constant and the exponent . a steep @xmath63 dependence , i.e. localizing this mixing to a narrow region below the outer convection zone , is suggested by the solar beryllium abundance which is believed to be essentially unaltered since the formation of the solar system @xcite .",
    "we thus keep this parameter fixed to @xmath65 .",
    "the assumed overall strength of turbulent mixing can be changed by modifying the proportionality constant or the reference temperature @xmath62 . following @xcite ,",
    "the proportionality constant is kept fixed and we vary the reference temperature between log @xmath66 = 5.8 and 6.09 .",
    "this is the range of least efficient turbulent mixing that is compatible with the constraints of observed lithium abundances in warm halo stars .    in figure",
    "[ trends ] , the observed abundance trends are compared with predictions from stellar evolution models .",
    "we find the t6.0 model to match our observations best .",
    "higher - efficiency mixing produces shallower trends for most elements .",
    "however , calcium and titanium can be levitated by radiative forces and additional mixing suppresses this tendency making trends mildly steeper .",

    "that is , the line spectrum of a helium - normal atmosphere corresponds to the line spectrum of a helium - poor atmosphere at somewhat higher log @xmath22 .",

    "accounting for an extra 0.1dex lessens the agreement between diffusion - corrected stellar abundances and the primordial value . a gap of 0.10.2dex can , however , be explained , e.g. , by mixing through population iii stars ( see @xcite , but see also @xcite for some criticism of this scenario ) .",
    "atmospheric abundances of unevolved , metal - poor stars seem systematically affected by atomic diffusion .",
    "this is particularly true for ratios with respect to hydrogen where diffusion corrections can reach 0.20.3dex for widely used elements like mg or fe ( see fig .",
    "[ 6397cc ] ) .",
    "abundance ratios of metals ( e.g.  mg / fe ) may only be affected by 0.05dex .",
    "nonetheless , for the highest accuracy the predictions from atomic - diffusion models have to be included .    for the time being , we have no understanding of the metallicity dependence of turbulent mixing .",
    "it could be that extremely metal - poor stars ( like he 1327 - 2326 , @xcite ) are therefore more ( or less ) affected by atomic diffusion .",
    "we are in the process of investigating this issue .",
    "it is highly desirable to understand the physical processes that give rise to mixing below the convection zone .",
    "encouraging results based on hydrodynamic models have already been presented by @xcite .      in deriving stellar ages with the help of isochrones ,",
    "two fundamentally different situations need to be discussed . on the one hand , there are populations of stars ( like globular clusters ) ; on the other hand , there are individual field stars .",
    "the impact of atomic diffusion on age determinations differs in these two cases , as detailed below .",
    "globular - cluster ages are unlikely to be affected by our findings , for two reasons : firstly , their metallicities are usually derived from red - giant stars which show in their atmospheres the composition of the gas they formed from ( with some notable exceptions ) .",
    "secondly , helium diffusion has been considered in deriving globular - cluster isochrone ages for quite some time @xcite .",
    "ages for unevolved halo field stars will be modified by atomic diffusion .",
    "one needs to consider the interplay of metal diffusion ( i.e.  comparing to the correct isochrone ) and helium diffusion ( i.e.  shifting the surface gravity upward ) .",
    "main - sequence and top stars will likely get lower ages , while subgiants may become somewhat older .",
    "we postpone a quantitative discussion of these effects to a forthcoming paper .",
    "large , magnitude - limited surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) provide us with a wealth of information on the chemical composition of the galactic halo . if one performs analyses of dwarfs and giants in a certain apparent - magnitude range , one inevitably samples different space volumes , more nearby ones with the dwarfs , more distant ones with the giants .",
    "large samples of stars can then define metallicity distribution functions ( mdf ) and one may want to look for gradients with galacto - centric distance or height above the galactic plane .",
    "assume that one finds that the mdfs of distant giants and more nearby dwarfs peak at the same metallicity .",
    "does this mean that there are no abundance gradients in that direction ?",
    "in the light of atomic diffusion affecting dwarf - star abundances only , this apparent null result actually means that the more distant population of stars is 0.10.2dex more metal - poor .",
    "we recently computed models similar to those used here for [ fe / h]= @xmath11.5 , the metallicity of ngc 6752 .",
    "the predictions indicate abundance trends practically as large as in ngc 6397 ( if turbulent mixing is assumed to be equally efficient ) .",
    "we will study ngc 6752 with flames - uves and giraffe - medusa to quantify potential effects of atomic diffusion and mixing at this metallicity .",
    "@xcite studied m 13 at [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath11.5 , but found no abundance trends .",
    "however , their work only included three unevolved ( subgiant ) stars .",
    "this study may thus not sample the region where atomic diffusion acts in sufficient detail . nonetheless , the three least evolved stars show a mean iron abundance 0.15dex below the average of the other 22 ( giant ) stars .",
    "better sampling of the turnoff region was achieved by @xcite for m  5 at [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath11.3 ( six top stars ) . to within the abundance uncertainties ( claimed to be 0.1dex ) , they find no trends for a variety of elements .",
    "concerns about the data quality could be raised , as the top stars have s / n ratios of 4050 _ per 4-pixel resolution element_. however , there is currently no satisfactory explanation for the absence of abundance trends in m 5 , unless one proposes that turbulent mixing is markedly more efficient than the strength found in ngc 6397 .    at even higher metallicities ,",
    "effects are expected to diminish , as the convection zones of more metal - rich stars are more massive than those of metal - poor ones .",
    "we have identified significant abundance trends for the elements lithium , magnesium and iron between groups of stars from the turnoff point to the bump on the red - giant branch .",
    "other elements studied ( calcium , titanium and barium ) show shallower trends of weak statistical significance . for lithium , the global trend can be explained by dilution of the atmospheric layers with lithium - free material as the convective envelope expands inward . for the other elements ,",
    "we show that atomic diffusion ( the net effect from gravitational settling and radiative levitation ) and turbulent mixing below the convective envelope can describe the trends in an element - specific way .",
    "a diffusion signature is also identified for lithium in stars on the spite plateau and their original lithium abundance is inferred to be @xmath100(li)=2.54 @xmath17 0.1 , in good agreement with wmap - based predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "our study has consequences for the use of unevolved metal - poor stars as tracers of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "their isochrone ages are also systematically affected by atomic diffusion .    for the time being , the turbulent mixing needed to bring theoretical predictions in agreement with observations is prescribed in an ad - hoc way .",
    "it would be desirable to isolate the physical process that gives rise to the turbulent mixing below the convective envelope .",
    "the predictions of hydrodynamic models will have to be put to the test by means of observations like the ones we presented here .",
    "recently , @xmath101li was traced in several metal - poor field stars at levels well above those that can be explained by galactic production @xcite .",
    "the atomic - diffusion corrections derived here ( @xmath0 + 0.25dex , see fig .",
    "[ predictions ] ) elevate the abundances even further . together with pre - main - sequence burning , they thus aggravate the @xmath101li problem . if the detections are confirmed by more sophisticated modelling ( but cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is unclear where all this @xmath101li was synthesized ; various processes are investigated @xcite .",
    "lithium thus remains an enigmatic element .",

    "<S> we present a homogeneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 18 stars along the evolutionary sequence of the metal - poor globular cluster ngc 6397 ( [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath12 ) , from the main - sequence turnoff point to red giants below the bump . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic stellar parameters , in particular stellar - parameter differences between groups of stars , are in good agreement with broad - band and strmgren photometry calibrated on the infrared - flux method . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic abundance analysis reveals , for the first time , systematic trends of iron abundance with evolutionary stage . </S>",
    "<S> iron is found to be 31% less abundant in the turnoff - point stars than in the red giants . </S>",
    "<S> an abundance difference in lithium is seen between the turnoff - point and warm subgiant stars . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of potential systematic errors on these abundance trends ( stellar parameters , the hydrostatic and lte approximations ) is quantitatively evaluated and found not to alter our conclusions significantly . </S>",
    "<S> trends for various elements ( li , mg , ca , ti and fe ) are compared with stellar - structure models including the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> such models are found to describe the observed element - specific trends well , if extra ( turbulent ) mixing just below the convection zone is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that atomic diffusion and turbulent mixing are largely responsible for the sub - primordial stellar lithium abundances of warm halo stars . </S>",
    "<S> other consequences of atomic diffusion in old metal - poor stars are also discussed . </S>"
