    "@xmath11 have its ( @xmath12)-th entry as @xmath13 when @xmath14 , and as @xmath15 when @xmath16 .",
    "the qmst can be viewed as a generalization of many well known optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem , the quadratic assignment problem , the maximum clique problem etc . , and it can be used in modeling various real life application areas such as telecommunication , transportation , irrigation energy distribution , and so on .",
    "the problem was introduced by assad and xu @xcite , along with its special case - _ the adjacent - only quadratic minimum spanning tree problem ( aqmst ) _ , in which @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not adjacent .",
    "the strong np - hardness of both the qmst and aqmst was proved in  @xcite along with ideas for solving the problem using exact and heuristic algorithms .",
    "the broad applications base and inherent complexity of the qmst makes it an interesting topic for further research .",
    "most of the works on qmst have been focussed on heuristic algorithms  @xcite .",
    "usti and punnen  @xcite provided a characterization qmst instances that can be solved as a minimum spanning tree problem .",
    "exact algorithm for aqmst and qmst was studied by pereira , gendreau , and cunha  @xcite .",
    "a special case of qmst with one quadratic term was studied by buchheim and klein  @xcite , a. fischer and f. fischer  @xcite .",
    "there are many other problems which have been studied in the literature , that are closely related to the qmst in terms of formulation and applications .",
    "we list below some of these variations of qmst that we investigate in this paper .    _ the minimum spanning tree problem with conflict pairs ( mstc ) _",
    "@xcite : given a graph @xmath10 with edge costs @xmath3 and a set @xmath20 , the mstc is to find a spanning tree of @xmath10 such that the tree cost is minimized and for each edge pair @xmath21 in @xmath22 , at most one of them is included in the tree .",
    "the feasibility problem of the mstc , denoted by fstc , is the problem of finding a feasible solution of the mstc , regardless of the costs .",
    "given an fstc instance , we construct a qmst on the same graph with @xmath23 then the fstc instance is feasible if and only if the above qmst has the optimal objective function value 0 .",
    "therefore , the fstc reduces to the qmst .    _ the quadratic bottleneck spanning tree problem ( qbst ) _ : by replacing the objective function of the qmst with @xmath24 , we obtain the qbst .",
    "the problem is introduced in @xcite and shown to be np - hard even on a bipartite graph with 0 - 1 @xmath25 values .",
    "fqbst , the feasibility version of the qbst , is described as _  given a value @xmath26 , does there exist a spanning tree @xmath27 of @xmath10 such that @xmath28?\"_. as the fqbst is equivalent to the fstc , @xcite develops heuristic algorithms for the qbst using mstc heuristics as subroutines .    _ the bottleneck spanning tree problem with conflict pairs ( bstc ) _ : similar to the relation between the qbst and the qmst , the bstc is defined by substituting the  min - sum \" objective function in the mstc with a  min - max \" objective function .",
    "furthermore , we define the  adjacent - only counterparts \" for the above problems : aqbst , in which @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not adjacent in the graph @xmath10 ; mstac , fstac , bstac , where the edges in the conflict pairs are all restricted to be adjacent .",
    "even though the above problems are all proved to be np - hard in general , exploring nicely solvable special cases provide additional insights into the structure of these problems and opportunities for developing effective heuristics  @xcite .",
    "the primary research question we focus in this paper is : _ to what extend the qmst and its variations would retain its np - hardness status , or become amenable for polynomial time solvability ? _ we consider restricting the structure of the graph @xmath10 and that of the cost matrix @xmath29 to identify possible demarkation between easy and hard instances .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ secgraphs ] introduces the sparse graphs that we are investigating .",
    "these include fans , fan - stars , ladders , wheels and their generalizations , @xmath0-ladders and @xmath0-accordions .",
    "a recursive formula is derived to count the number of spanning trees of a @xmath0-accordion , which generalizes the well known sparring tree counting formulas for fans and ladders . in section  [ seccomplexity ]",
    "we study the complexity of qmst and its variations on these sparse graphs .",
    "it is shown that the problems are np - hard , except in the case of aqbst , mstac , bstac and aqbst on @xmath0-ladders and for these cases , we provide @xmath30 time algorithms .",
    "the problems on a general graph @xmath10 but with specially structured cost matrices are discussed in section  [ secgraded ] . in particular , we show that when @xmath29 is a permuted doubly graded matrix , qmst and qbst are solvable in polynomial time . in this case",
    "the optimal solution value attains the assad - xu lower bound @xcite .",
    "this result is extended to the case of matroid bases and it provides a new characterization of matroids .",

    "the quadratic costs @xmath33 for the edge - pair @xmath34 is sometimes denoted by @xmath13 for simplicity .",
    "in this section we define the classes of graphs called @xmath0-ladders and @xmath0-accordions and study qmst and its variations on these graphs .",
    "we also study the number of spanning trees on such graphs , that is , the number of feasible solutions of the corresponding qmst .    , a wheel @xmath35 and a fan - star @xmath36    given a path @xmath37 , _ a fan ( @xmath38 ) _ is obtained by introducing a new node @xmath39 and edges @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "if we add one more edge @xmath42 to @xmath38 , the resulting graph is called _ a wheel _ , denoted by @xmath43 . when @xmath44 , deleting the edges @xmath45 @xmath46 from @xmath38 results in _ a fan - star ( @xmath47)_. examples of a fan , a wheel and a fan - star are presented in figure  [ fan ] .",

    "the formulas for counting the number of spanning trees of @xmath38 and @xmath53 are already known  @xcite .",

    "the proof is straightforward due to the fact that the total number of spanning trees in @xmath10 is the number of spanning trees that contain @xmath18 , plus the number of spanning trees without @xmath18 .",
    "a recursive formula for the number of spanning trees of a @xmath0-accordion is given in the following theorem .",
    "[ enu ] every @xmath0-accordion has the same number of spanning trees . if we denote this number by @xmath81 , then for every integers @xmath54 , @xmath82 @xmath83    let @xmath56 be a @xmath0-accordion generated by @xmath57-cycles @xmath84 .",
    "similarly let @xmath85 and @xmath86 be the corresponding @xmath87 and @xmath88-accordions generated respectively by the @xmath57-cycles @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "an edge @xmath18 in @xmath56 is called a ` free edge ' if @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "likewise , an edge @xmath18 in @xmath85 is called a ` free edge ' if @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 be the graph obtained by contracting a free edge of @xmath56 and @xmath96 be the graph obtained by contracting a free edge of @xmath85 . if @xmath18 is a free edge of @xmath85 then @xmath97 .",
    "thus from lemma [ rr ] , @xmath98 note that any spanning tree of @xmath56 either contains all free edges or does not contain exactly one free edge .",
    "further , any spanning tree that contains all free edges does not contain the edge @xmath99 which is common to both @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "then the graph obtained from @xmath56 by deleting @xmath99 and then contracting the path of free edges is isomorphic to @xmath96 . since @xmath56 contains @xmath102 free edges , we have @xmath103 from ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we have @xmath104 recall that @xmath56 is an arbitrary @xmath0-accordion with @xmath82 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 depend on @xmath56 , and are @xmath87-accordion and @xmath88-accordion , respectively .",
    "note that there is only one @xmath105-accordion and all @xmath106-accordions are isomorphic .",
    "hence , for a fixed @xmath57 and @xmath107 , every @xmath0-accordion has the same number of spanning trees .",
    "then from recursion it follows that for every fixed @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the number of spanning trees for any @xmath0-accordion is the same , and hence its recursive formula is given by .",
    "theorem  [ enu ] gives an implicit formula for the number of spanning trees on general @xmath0-accordions . in the case",
    "@xmath108 , it gives us @xmath109 by solving the recursion we obtain @xmath110 when @xmath111 , @xmath112 , from which it follows that @xmath113 formulas and are consistent with the known spanning tree enumeration formulas for fans and ladders  @xcite , moreover , they generalize them .",
    "furthermore , theorem  [ enu ] can be used to deduce explicit formulas for the @xmath0-accordions for any fixed @xmath57 .",
    "since every element of @xmath68 contains an exponential number of spanning trees , solving the qmst and its variations on this class of graphs by complete enumeration would be computationally expensive .",
    "we now investigate the complexity of the qmst and its variations on the sparse graphs discussed in section  [ secgraphs ] .",
    "recall from section  [ secintro ] that fstac is the feasibility version of the adjacent only minimum spanning tree problem with conflict pair constraints .",
    "[ base ] the fstac on fan - stars is np - complete .",
    "we reduce the 3-sat problem to the fstac on the fan star @xmath47 .",

    "the conflict set @xmath22 is defined as @xmath119 note that the edges in each conflict pair are adjacent .",
    "if @xmath27 is a solution of the fstac on @xmath10 , then let @xmath120 be such that @xmath121 is true if @xmath122 , and false otherwise . for each @xmath123 , at least one of @xmath124 must be true since @xmath27 contains at least one of @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , @xmath126 and @xmath127 can not both be in @xmath27 if @xmath128 , so in @xmath129 at most one of @xmath121 , @xmath130 will be true if they are negations of each other .",
    "hence @xmath129 is a true assignment for the 3-sat problem .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath131 is a true assignment of the 3-sat problem .",
    "then @xmath132 is an acyclic subgraph of @xmath10 with at most one edge from each conflict pair .",
    "if @xmath22 spans @xmath10 , then it is a solution of the fstac . otherwise , we add necessary edges from @xmath133 to @xmath22 to form a spanning tree @xmath27 , which gives us a solution of the fstac .",
    "the result now follows from the np - completeness of 3-sat .",
    "since fstac is the feasibility version of mstac , the mstac is also np - hard on fan - stars .",
    "fan - star is a subgraph of a fan and a wheel , hence the mstac on fan - stars can be reduced to the mstac on fans or wheels by assigning large costs on additional edges .",
    "that proves np - hardness of the mstac on fans , wheels and @xmath0-accordions .",
    "mstac is a special case of mstc and aqmst , and mstc is a special case of qmst , hence all of those problems are np - hard on fan - stars , fans , wheels and @xmath0-accordions .",
    "furthermore , from theorem  [ base ] it easily follows that all bottleneck versions of these problems are np - hard on fan - stars , fans , wheels and @xmath0-accordions .",

    "the detailed proof is very similar to the one given in theorem  [ base ] , and hence omitted .",
