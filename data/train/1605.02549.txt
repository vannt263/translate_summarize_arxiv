    "x - ray powder diffraction is one of the most suitable and direct methods for phase analysis and the determination of lattice parameters .",
    "the normal procedure requires a grinding of the starting material , which could be single crystals or a conglomerate of polycrystalline material , to a fine powder .",
    "ideally , a flat specimen of randomly oriented crystallites is prepared and placed in the center of the diffractometer circle ( bragg - brentano geometry ) .",
    "however , there are several cases where the grinding of samples is not possible or not suitable : for example , the material could be too malleable and smears out instead of breaking into small crystallites@xcite or the available amount is not sufficient for a powder sample ( e.g. liir single crystals@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is sometimes advantageous to select a particular single crystal out of a larger batch ( e.g. for measuring the specific heat , magnetization , etc . ) _ based _ on the lattice parameter , followed by further measurements of the physical properties . not of the least concern",
    "is the crime of grinding a beautiful , well - faceted single crystal into a barren powder .",
    "however , in many cases it is possible to perform x - ray diffraction measurements on single crystals in full analogy to powder measurements , e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "the measurements can be carried out on compact , commercially available diffractometers in a fast and easy to adopt experimental routine . including sample mounting the whole procedure",
    "can be done within a couple of minutes without any recalibration or hardware adjustment of the diffractometer .",
    "in particular for plate - like single crystals with large surfaces perpendicular to high - symmetry directions the procedure is straightforward .",
    "such plate - like morphologies are known for tetragonal , hexagonal , orthorhombic and even monoclinic crystals . when the movement of sample holder ( @xmath1 ) and x - ray detector ( 2@xmath2 ) are coupled ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "then only lattice planes parallel to the surface of the sample holder are accessible ( the same situation occurs in @xmath2-@xmath2 geometry for diffractometer with @xmath4 and @xmath5 as mechanical axis ) . for simplicity and since @xmath1 and 2@xmath2",
    "are indeed mechanically coupled in several commercially available diffractometers we restrict our considerations to this case ( the extension to variable @xmath1/@xmath6 or @xmath2-@xmath2 geometries is straightforward ) .",
    "this paper is meant to provide a guide to accurate measurements of single crystals using a powder diffractometer that does not require vast experience in x - ray diffraction . in section[hohe ] the correction of the error introduced by the sample height is discussed in order to eliminate the main error source in such measurements .",
    "other errors ( such as the use of a flat rather than a curved specimen or the sample transparency ) are neglected .",
    "the measurements performed on standard materials indicate a relative error for the lattice parameter of @xmath7% , provided the diffractometer is well aligned ( which was checked by corresponding powder diffraction measurements ) . in section[tilt ] we address the measurement of samples that are small and/or show a significant misalignment .",

    "the enlarged views shown in the panels b ) and c ) reveal a shift of @xmath10 for the @xmath8 reflection that is reduced to @xmath11 for the @xmath9 reflection .",
    "the @xmath12 splitting of the @xmath9 reflection is clearly visible in both samples.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the surface of a powder specimen can be adjusted to coincide with the diffractometer axis with a high degree of accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "mounting a single crystal at the correct height and simultaneously keeping the surface parallel to the sample holder can be an arduous task .",
    "however , the effect of a sample displacement on the bragg peak position is crucial ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this is shown in fig.[silicon ] for the diffraction pattern of silicon measured on a powder and on a single crystal , respectively .",
    "the measurements were performed using a rigaku miniflex2 diffractometer with cu-@xmath12 radiation ( graphite monochromator ) .",
    "the intensity was normalized with respect to the @xmath8 peak .",
    "the silicon powder was sprinkled on a zero - background sample holder .",
    "the displacement of the powder surface is close to zero as confirmed by a lebail fit and the small value of the obtained sample height ( see below ) .",
    "the single crystal , a small piece of a wafer , is oriented along ( 111 ) and , accordingly , only two reflections are available for @xmath13 ( those are @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the single crystal has a thickness of 0.78 mm , a typical size for samples investigated in basic solid state research .",
    "this value corresponds to the theoretical displacement .",
    "both , the powder sample and the single crystal , as mounted for the measurement , are shown as insets in fig.[silicon ] .",
    "enlarged views of the diffraction patterns around the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 bragg peaks are given in figs.[silicon]b and c , respectively .",
    "the peak positions for cu-@xmath14 wavelength was determined from a pseudo - voigt fit . for the powder",
    ", the @xmath8 bragg peak appears at @xmath15 in reasonable agreement with the literature data ( nist standard 640d , @xmath16 ) . for the single crystal ,",
    "however , the peak position is shifted by @xmath17 to 29.07@xmath18 .",
    "the difference in the peak positions is somewhat smaller for the @xmath9 bragg peak : @xmath19 ( fig.[silicon]c , intensities are normalized ) .",
    "the peak position of the powder , @xmath20 , is again close to the expected value of @xmath21 , whereas a significantly larger value of @xmath22 is obtained for the single crystal .",
    "the good agreement of the powder data with the literature values indicates that the deviation observed for the single crystal is dominated by the sample height ( @xmath23 displacement ) .",
    "other error sources , like a @xmath6-offset of the detector , misalignment , or transparency are negligible in this case .",
    "( sample height ) , the peak position is shifted as shown by the red line .",
    "the misalignment due to the sample height causes a shift of @xmath24 along the diffractometer circle [ @xmath25.,scaledwidth=57.0% ]    the effect of the sample height on the peak position is given by @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the sample height and @xmath29 the diffractometer radius .",
    "this equation can be derived based on geometrical considerations ( fig.[sketch ] ) : @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 and with @xmath32 ( in radians ) the above formula follows ( the factor of two results from a shift of both incident and outgoing beam ) . for the case of a single crystal",
    "the incident beam is depicted by the red line .",
    "in fact , here it is not the center of the x - ray beam ( dotted line ) that fulfills the bragg equation but the divergent part ( straight line ) .",
    "the displacement results in a modified bragg equation :    @xmath33    that can be written as    @xmath34     times @xmath35 as a function of the scattering angle @xmath6 ( @xmath36 miller index , @xmath37@xmath38 cu-@xmath14 wavelength , see text for details ) .",

    "procedures for correcting the displacement have been described earlier , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "those are based on evaluating the dependence of the apparent lattice spacings on trigonometric functions of @xmath2 .",
    "given the wide availability of numerical solutions , we propose a different approach : since only one orientation has to be considered , we write the bragg equation [ for ( @xmath8 ) silicon ] as    @xmath43    with @xmath44 or 3 for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 reflections , respectively ( @xmath45 being the lattice parameter with @xmath46 for a cubic lattice ) .",
    "it is important to consistently distinguish between radian and degree as unit for the angle ; when @xmath2 as the argument of the above function is provided in radians than @xmath41 is also computed in radians and the sample height follows directly as @xmath47 .",
    "however , if the full argument of the fitting function is transformed in radians ( inside the defined fitting function ) , than s is computed in degree and @xmath28 has to be multiplied by @xmath48 .    in order to allow for a convenient tabular and graphical presentation",
    ", we consider the right - hand side of equation(5 ) as dependent variable ( `` @xmath49 '' ) that is a function of the independent variable @xmath2 ( `` @xmath30 '' ) and determined by the ( unknown ) parameters @xmath45 and @xmath41 .",
    "the fitting was performed with origin 9.1 ( levenberg - marquardt iteration algorithm ) , the corresponding plot is shown in fig.[fit]a .",
    "such a graphical representation is not necessary in order to calculate the lattice parameters .",
    "however , it helps to check the fitting results for consistency .",
    "the analogous procedure was performed for strontium titanate ( fig.[fit]b ) , measured using a rigaku miniflex 600 diffractometer ( cu-@xmath12 , ni - filter , d / tex position sensitive detector ) . the strontium titanate single crystal ( a  piece of a wafer ) was oriented along ( @xmath50 ) and 1.0 mm thick . in the given orientation ,",
    "four reflections are available in the accessible @xmath6 range .",
    "the @xmath51 in the denominator of the modified bragg equation ( eq.[braggspez ] ) has to be dropped since lattice spacing , lattice parameter and miller index are directly related by @xmath52 for the @xmath53 bragg peaks of srtio@xmath54 .",
    "[ tab_si ]    the obtained values for lattice parameters and sample height are summarized in tab.[tab_si ] .",
    "furthermore , the lattice parameters calculated without the correction are given for comparison .",
    "those values have been obtained by constraining the sample height to zero , that is the lattice parameter is the only free parameter in the fit of equation5 to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 peak position whereas @xmath55 . without correcting for the sample height of the si single crystal ,",
    "the calculated lattice parameter differs significantly ( 0.5% ) from the literature value of @xmath56@xcite .",
    "this value is also obtained as result of a lebail fit of si powder ( nist standard ) data using the gsas software package@xcite .",
    "the error is even larger ( 2.1% ) when only the @xmath8 reflection is considered .",
    "similar behavior is observed for strontium titanate : the lattice parameter after correcting for the sample height is in good agreement with the literature value of @xmath57@xcite .",
    "a lebail fit of the powder data with gsas@xcite yields @xmath58 .",
    "the rather large negative sample height observed for the strontium titanate powder is caused by a deeper sample holder . the sample holder has not been completely filled but a small amount of powder was sprinkled on the bottom in order to resemble a flat sample that is placed with an offset similar to the bottom of the waver . in this way ,",
    "the difference of the sample heights calculated for powder and waver , respectively , should correspond to the thickness of the sample .",
    "a powder measurement of a nist silicon standard confirmed the good alignment of the diffractometer .    with the modified bragg equation ( 4 ) as given above , a negative sample height corresponds to the sample surface being below the axis of the diffractometer ( @xmath23 theoretical zero - position ) .",
    "the small difference between the measured thickness of the si single crystal ( 0.78 mm ) and the calculated value of 0.86 mm - ( -0.06 mm ) = 0.92 mm is caused by a thin layer of grease that has been used for sample mounting and/or by the uncertainty in defining the effective diffractometer radius @xmath29 .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the strontium titanate single crystal : the difference in the calculated sample heights amounts to 0.80 mm - ( -0.29 mm ) = 1.09 mm in fair agreement with the measured thickness of 1.0 mm .",

    "the oscillations are caused by the sample - spin that is usually used during measurements of powders in order to improve averaging over crystallite orientations .",
    "c , d ) manual rotation of the sample ( goniometer ) in order to maximize the intensity .",
    "an increase in intensity by a factor of 2000 is obtained - note the change of scale for panel d.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    an optimization of the measurement procedure is useful or sometimes necessary if the sample is small and/or misaligned .",
    "this can be achieved by manually rotating the sample holder such that the tilt of the corresponding ( reciprocal ) lattice vector points out of the scattering plane .",
    "provided the misalignment ( tilt ) is not too large , the scattered x - ray beam can still fulfill the bragg equation and hit the symmetrically positioned detector .",
    "this holds true since divergence slits are broader in the direction perpendicular to the scattering plane in order to allow for higher intensities .",
    "an intensional misalignment of a silicon waver by roughly @xmath60 had no significant effect on the peak position of the bragg reflections .    the proposed alignment can be completed within a few minutes . to illustrate the whole procedure with an example ,",
    "we show the orientation of a silicon wafer step by step .",
    "first , the detector has to be moved to a @xmath6 position that fulfills the bragg equation by performing a conventional @xmath3 scan in the vicinity of the expected peak position ( fig.[rotate]a ) .",
    "this is a simple task for the case of the silicon wafer . for misaligned and/or small samples",
    "the peak intensity might be low and the peak position not well defined .",
    "however , a rough estimate within @xmath61 is sufficient at this point . for the silicon wafer",
    "we find @xmath59 .",
    "fig.[rotate]b shows the intensity at this position as a function of time ( the goniometer angle is kept fixed at @xmath62 ) .",
    "the oscillations are caused by the sample spin that takes place at a frequency of 0.25hz .",
    "this measurement demonstrates the necessity of the additional alignment : in case of a flat curve it is apparently useless , whereas strong oscillations - as shown here - indicate the possibility to significantly improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a flat curve can be caused by a good alignment and/or a large mosaicity of the single crystal ( with lower intensities for the latter ) .    in a next step",
    "the sample - spin is switched off and the intensity is measured as a function of time . a low intensity of roughly 10 counts per second ( cps ) is obtained ( fig.[rotate]c ) .",
    "next the diffractometer is opened which causes the shutter to close and the intensity to drop to zero instantaneously ( depending on the setup , the measurement may have to be interrupted by a software command ) .",
    "now the sample holder is rotated by a few degrees ( by hand ) , the diffractometer closed and the measurement resumed . at first , no change in intensity is obtained as a result of the performed rotations . however , after six repetitions the intensity increases somewhat and the subsequent rotations are performed in smaller steps of roughly one degree .",
    "a huge increase is observed after step number ten : the intensity increases to @xmath63cps ( fig.[rotate]d , note that the scale is changed ) . a further increase to more than 20,000cps",
    "is obtained on further careful rotations of the sample holder .",
    "eventually , the intensity has been increased by a factor of 2000 compared to the initial values or by roughly one order of magnitude compared with the average of @xmath64cps ( sample - spin on , fig.[rotate]a , b ) .",
    "now a regular @xmath3 scan is performed with the optimized orientation of the sample holder . in case",
    "the position of the peak , that had been initially selected for the alignment , changes significantly , the whole procedure should be repeated .",
    "a measurement performed on a well aligned sample can show a significantly improved signal - to - noise ratio when compared to a conventional measurement ( with sample - spin on ) .",
    "this alignment procedure allows for fast measurements with scan rates as high as 10 degrees per minute or more on large enough samples .",
    "furthermore , the number of accessible peaks at a given scan speed can be higher .",
    "ultimately , samples of a size of @xmath65 m or smaller , which might otherwise require single crystal diffraction techniques , can be measured .",
    "when single crystals are measured on a powder diffractometer , the sample height has to be considered or otherwise a significant error is introduced : a displacement of 100@xmath0 m causes a shift of @xmath66 ( for a diffractometer radius of 150 mm at @xmath67 ) .",
    "in contrast , the zero - shift of a well maintained diffractometer is supposed to be well below 0.05@xmath18 .",
    "at least two bragg reflections are necessary to correct for the sample height by calculating the effect on the peak position .",
    "the calculation can be done by a rather simple least - squares fitting in contrast to a sophisticated refinement which requires further efforts and experience .",
    "when more than two reflections are available , additional corrections can be performed : e.g. for a zero - shift in @xmath6 or the transparency . for the latter one , a term proportional to sin(@xmath6 )",
    "could be added in addition to the cos(@xmath2 ) term of the modified bragg equation . however , since the zero - shift highly correlates with the sample displacement and the transparency , these parameters should not be refined together .",
    "in particular for substitution series the measurement can be restricted to the regions around the expected bragg reflections ( once the phase purity has been settled ) .",
    "even when investigating such substitution series , where the _ change _ of the lattice parameter with the concentration of a certain component is more important than the absolute values of the lattice parameter , the sample height is important since the aspect ratio ( and therefore the average thickness ) may also change systematically with the concentration leading to inaccurate results .    to summarize , we describe a fast , accurate , and non - destructive method for measuring the lattice parameters of single crystals using a standard powder diffractometer .",
