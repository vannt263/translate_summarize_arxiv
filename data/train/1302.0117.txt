    "variety of chemical reactions occur in fluid environment and represents very important subject in various chemical , biological or physical systems @xcite . in these processes",
    "the reacting particles are affected not only by the diffusion motion but also by the external fluid flow .",
    "the usual approach to such reactive flows is based on some combination of reaction - transport equations .    in this work",
    "we will concentrate on the study of the annihilation reaction @xmath10 , which is the paradigmatic model for the reaction - diffusion processes . for this type of reaction in low space dimensions",
    "the usual description by means of kinetic rate equation is not sufficient and the effect of density fluctuations must be taken into the account @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the upper critical dimension for this process , even in the absence of advective flow , is two due to the density fluctuations .",
    "a renormalization group treatment was successfully applied for different choices of reactive flow , e.g. time - independent random drift @xcite , velocity field described by stochastic navier - stokes equation @xcite or short - range correlated potential disorder @xcite . often large differences are observed in relation to the experiment and their origin can be caused by the presence of large - scale anisotropies , effect of compressibility or parity violation .",
    "there are important differences @xcite between advection of scalar quantities like density on one hand and like tracer ( temperature , concentration ) on the other by compressible versus incompressible flow .",
    "it was shown that compressibility could lead to the slowing of transport process for scalar admixture and also to the enhancement of intermittent phenomena .",
    "these effects might be understood as a result of inhibition of separation between particle trajectories and therefore we expect that reacting particles would spent effectively more time in the mutual vicinity than in the incompressible case . hence in this case",
    "we expect the faster decay rate than for the incompressible case . hence it would be desirable to support such naive picture in more quantitative manner . in order to do that we will apply antonov - kraichnan model @xcite for describing advection of reactive @xmath11 particles and we will present renormalization group ( rg ) study in the vicinity of its critical dimension @xmath0 . in the one - loop order all relevant physical quantities",
    "are calculated and contrary to the incompressible case it is found out , that already in the one - loop approximation fluctuations of the velocity field affect the renormalization of the rate constant .    after brief description of the model in sec .",

    "last term in the action stands for the initial conditions , which are traditionally chosen in the form of poisson distribution .    in compressible velocity field , there are two types of diffusion - advection problems : advection of a density field and advection of a tracer field @xcite . here , the case of advection of a density field will be analyzed @xcite . in the action ( [ eq : s_1 ] ) this corresponds to the replacement @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the advecting velocity field . according to @xcite let us assume that @xmath19 is a random gaussian variable with zero mean and the correlator ( in the frequency - momentum representation ) @xmath20 ,    \\label{correlator_v}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the coupling constant , the exponents @xmath3,@xmath4 and @xmath2 play the role of small expansion parameters .",
    "they could be regarded as an analog of the expansion parameter @xmath22 used in the theory of critical phenomena . however , in this paper @xmath3 should be understood as deviation of exponent of the power law from that of the kolmogorov scaling @xcite , whereas @xmath4 is defined as the deviation from the space dimension two via relation @xmath23 , and the exponent @xmath2 is related to the reciprocal of the correlation time at the wave number @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 serves for labeling of the fixed points and it can be interpreted as a ratio of velocity correlation time and the scalar turnover time @xcite . in ( [ correlator_v ] ) besides the standard ( incompressible ) transverse projection operator @xmath26 the longitudinal projector @xmath27 has been introduced . the positive ( necessary for positive definiteness of the correlator @xmath28 ) parameter @xmath6 represents the degree of compressibility .",
    "the incompressible case is obtained by the setting @xmath29 .",
    "+ the antonov - kraichnan model for the advection field @xmath19 contains two cases of special interest :    a.   in the limit @xmath30 we get the the rapid - change model @xmath31 , which is characterized by the white - in - time nature of the velocity correlator .",
    "b.   limit @xmath32 corresponds to the case of a frozen velocity field @xmath33 , when the velocity field is quenched ( time - independent ) .",
    "the averaging procedure with respect to the velocity field @xmath34 may be performed with the aid of the following action functional @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the inverse correlator ( [ correlator_v ] ) ( in the sense of the fourier transform ) .",
    "the expectation value of any relevant physical observable may be calculated using the complete weight functional @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the action functionals ( [ eq : s_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_2 ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of longitudinal part @xmath40 into the correlator for velocity field does not affect the renormalization group analysis developed for the such model @xcite .",

    "is given by @xmath96 and is stable in the region @xmath97 the fixed point with non - zero value of @xmath95 is given by @xmath98 and is stable in the region @xmath99",
    "fixed points @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponds to the non - interacting ( mean - field or gaussian ) theory and thus their predictions should agree with the ones of rate equation approach , which is indeed the case @xcite .    from the fixed points structure",
    "some physical consequences can be deduced .",
    "first we see , that compressibility has direct influence on the value of decay exponent ( see * fp 3 * , * fp 7 - 9 * ) . for some regimes ( * fp 3 * , * fp 7 * ) it could lead to the enhancement ( for both of them @xmath102 ) of the reaction process compared to the corresponding regimes for incompressible case @xcite . as was already pointed this fact can be explained by the presence of compressible sinks into which particles are attracted ( see also sec . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "however we also observe that when both density fluctuations and compressibility are relevant ( * fp 4 * , * fp 10 * ) , the density tends to suppress the influence of compressibility .",
    "the `` real problem '' corresponds to the choice @xmath103 , which leads to the famous kolmogorov `` five - thirds law '' @xcite for the spatial velocity statistics .",
    "it is easy to see , that this regime can be realized either by the fixed point * fp 9 * or * fp 10 * depending on the value of parameter @xmath4 , or equivalently on the space dimension @xmath104 . from ( [ fp9_ros ] ) and ( [ fp10_ros ] )",
    "we see that there is a `` critical '' value @xmath105 for the parameter @xmath4 , above which * fp 9 * is stable , whereas below it * fp 10 * is stable .",
    "because @xmath6 is positive quantity , a parameter @xmath106 is negative .",
    "therefore in the vicinity of the space dimension two ( @xmath107 ) regime represented by the fixed point * fp 9 * should be realized with the decay exponent @xmath108 .",
    "thus we can conclude , that compressibility has a profound effect on the large - scale asymptotic behavior of the annihilation process and leads to the enhancement of it near its critical dimension @xmath0 . on the other hand density fluctuations",
    "leads again to the suppression of compressibility ( as can be seen by direct numerical inspection of exponent @xmath63 for * fp 10 * ) .",
