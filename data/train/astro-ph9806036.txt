    "the forest lines therefore provide a critical constraint on cosmological models as well as important clues about the formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structures ( i.e. , voids , galaxy clusters , and galaxy superclusters ) .",
    "however , to make progress on this important topic and take advantage of the lines as a sensitive probe of cosmic phenomena from @xmath0 = 0 to @xmath0 = 5 , a better understanding of the _ nature _ of the absorbers is needed .",
    "the advent of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has provided important new insights about the absorbers and an opportunity to directly study the relationship between the absorption lines and galaxies .",
    "spectroscopy of 3c 273 with _ hst _ in the first cycle of observations revealed that there are considerably more ly@xmath16 lines at low redshift than expected based on a simple extrapolation of the observed evolution of the number of lines per unit redshift ( @xmath18 ) at high @xmath0 ( morris et al .",

    "( 1995 ) are dominated by much weaker lines with @xmath26 200 m .",
    "based on this line strength difference it has been suggested that there are two populations of absorbers at low redshift : ( 1 ) strong absorbers with @xmath27 ( ) @xmath28 @xmath29 ( corresponding to @xmath5 300 m  for doppler parameter @xmath30 35 ) that mostly occur in large gaseous halos of luminous galaxies , and ( 2 ) weaker absorbers with @xmath27 ( ) @xmath31 @xmath29 which are less closely tied to galaxies and may in some cases be truly intergalactic ( primordial ? ) gas clouds .",

    "an overall summary of our investigation is provided in  7 .",
    "further details on this project can be found in tripp ( 1997 ) . throughout the rest of this paper",
    "we assume @xmath33 = 75 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 and @xmath35 = 0 , and we rescale measurements from the literature to these values for the cosmological parameters .",
    "h 1821 + 643 was observed for 5.1 hours with the ghrs on march 29 , 1996 .",
    "standard target acquisition procedures were used to center the target in the large science aperture ( 1.74@xmath361.74  ) , and the qso was observed with the g140l grating .",
    "these observations were obtained after the installation of costar , and the spectra have resolution @xmath37 2000 with a spectral spread function approximately described by a narrow gaussian profile containing @xmath3870% of the line profile area and a broader profile containing @xmath330% of the area ( see figure 4 in robinson et al .",
    "1998 ) . in velocity units",
    "the resolution ( fwhm ) ranges from 160  at 1250   to 130  at 1540  .",
    "half - diode substepping was employed , which samples the ghrs spectral line spread function with @xmath31.2 diodes / fwhm . with this substepping pattern ( step pattern 4 ) , @xmath311% of the observing time is used for measuring the background with the science diodes . for accurate wavelength calibration , a pt - ne lamp was observed briefly at 1.7 hour intervals .",
    "the grating was positioned to provide complete wavelength coverage from 12521528  .",
    "combined with the earlier intermediate resolution ( 15 - 20 ) ghrs observations obtained by savage et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which included the 1231.71268.9 and 1521.21557.5    wavelength ranges , this allowed us to search for all clouds between  = 0.013 and  = 0.281 .",
    "since the qso systemic redshift is @xmath2 = 0.297 , these spectra cover all but a small fraction of the  forest on this sight line .",
    "the fos data obtained by bahcall et al .",
    "( 1992 ) can be used to fill in the missing redshift range , but their spectrum is not adequate for detection of the lines with @xmath39 250 m .",
    "bahcall et al . (",
    "1992 ) do not report detection of any lines at  @xmath7 0.013 , but they do detect a strong line at  = 0.297 , and a strong ly@xmath17 line is present at this redshift in our ghrs spectrum .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of high quality ghrs observations is ultimately limited by fixed pattern noise ( fpn ) due to scratches and manufacturing marks on the detector window and response irregularities of the photocathode .",
    "the detector diodes also introduce fixed pattern noise due to diode - to - diode sensitivity differences , but this noise is effectively reduced by comb addition and is generally weaker than the fpn due to the photocathode and faceplate . to reduce the fixed pattern noise , comb addition and the `` fp- split '' procedure were employed for the h 1821 + 643 observations .",
    "the fp- split procedure breaks an observation into subexposures and tilts the grating slightly between subexposures so that the position of the spectrum on the photocathode is shifted .",
    "when the subexposures are coadded _ in wavelength space _ , the fpn is smeared out and hence reduced .",
    "typically subexposures at four different grating tilts are obtained when the fp - split procedure is used , and s / n @xmath40 150 can be achieved when the subexposures are coadded ( cardelli & ebbets 1994 ) . to obtain higher s / n",
    ", the fixed pattern noise spectrum ( i.e. , the flat field ) must be derived from the fp - split subexposures and divided into the data . to prevent loss or degradation of data in case of _ hst _ glitches or orbital interrupts ( c.f .",
    "cardelli & ebbets ) , sets of four fp - split subexposures were read out roughly every four minutes , and a large number of subexposures at each of the four fp - split positions were obtained over the course of five hours .",
    "the preliminary data reduction was carried out at the ghrs computing facility at the goddard space flight center with the standard calhrs software .",
    "this included spectrum extraction and conversion to count rates , corrections for paired pulse events , background subtraction , and wavelength calibration .",
    "software developed at the university of wisconsin was then used to merge the individual subexposures and explore the usefulness of the fixed pattern noise flatfielding . due to non - repeatability of the grating carousel rotation ,",
    "slight positioning errors occur every time the grating is rotated , and degradation of resolution occurs if it is assumed that the grating was rotated by exactly the instructed amount for merging of subexposures . to achieve the highest possible resolution ,",
    "the centroids of well - detected and narrow absorption lines in the individual fp - split subexposures are calculated and used to determine the shifts for merging .",
    "finally , the zero point in the wavelength scale was determined by comparing the wavelengths of galactic interstellar absorption lines in the g140l spectrum to their known wavelengths derived from the high resolution interstellar absorption line study of savage et al .",

    "savage et al . also measured accurate wavelengths of the ly@xmath17 line at  = 0.22489 and the 1031.93   line at  = 0.22503 ( see also savage , tripp , & lu 1998 ) , so these lines were also used to determine the mean wavelength zero point .",
    "we estimate that the h 1821 + 643 g140l observations have an absolute velocity uncertainty of @xmath330 , which corresponds to a redshift uncertainty of @xmath30.0001 .",
    "the h 1821 + 643 g140l observation is close to the s / n regime where application of a fpn correction may be beneficial ( see  3 ) . after merging the data into four `` master '' fp - split subexposures ( i.e. , all fp - split subexposures at the same position on the photocathode combined ) we used the method of cardelli & ebbets ( 1994 ) to derive and",
    "apply the fpn correction . the final fpn corrected spectrum of h 1821 + 643",
    "is shown in figure  [ h1821grand ] where the observed count rate is plotted against heliocentric wavelength ( in  ) .",
    "note that at @xmath41 1251.6   and at @xmath42 1537.9  , the spectrum falls off the end of the diode array in some of the fp - split subexposures and consequently the s / n is lower in these regions .",
    "since these spectral regions have already been observed by savage et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at higher resolution , their only purpose in the g140l spectrum is to provide better constraints on the continuum placement .",
    "this is important at the short @xmath43 end of the g140l spectrum where the continuum rises ( see figure  [ h1821grand ] ) ; without the spectrum extention a significantly different continuum fit could be selected .",
    "the final s / n ranges from 100 to 160 per resolution element . the combined s / n and resolution are adequate for detection of 50 m   lines at the 3@xmath4 level or better throughout the g140l spectrum .",
    "pg 1116 + 215 was observed for 3.5 hours with the ghrs on 4 february 1997 .",
    "the observational setup and data reduction procedure were nearly identical to the h 1821 + 643 observation and reductions , but quarter - diode substepping ( step pattern 5 ) was used to provide more on - target exposure time and less ( but still ample ) time spent measuring the background . after the pg 1116 + 215 observations were fully reduced ( including the fpn correction )",
    ", the data were binned to half - diode samples to improve the s / n and match the h 1821 + 643 data .",
    "the final fpn corrected and half - diode binned spectrum of pg 1116 + 215 is plotted in figure  [ p1116grand ] . while h 1821 + 643 was actually brighter than expected when we observed it with the ghrs g140l grating , pg 1116 + 215 was apparently fainter than expected based on previous _ iue _ and _ hst _ measurements .",
    "consequently , the count rate was lower than expected .",
    "the s / n ( @xmath3 75 - 160 per resolution element ) of the pg 1116 + 215 ghrs g140l spectrum is adequate for detection of 75 m  lines at the 3@xmath4 level or better throughout the entire spectrum and at the 50 m   level for @xmath44 1400  .",
    "a special zero point velocity correction was not applied to the pg 1116 + 215 observations .",
    "the weak interstellar lines of and ( see  3.1.2 ) have average heliocentric velocities of @xmath317  while 21 cm emission in the direction of pg 1116 + 215 has an average heliocentric velocity of -20   ( lockman & savage 1995 ) . some of this difference could be due to the pronounced positive velocity wing of emission seen in the 21 cm profile .",
    "we estimate that the pg 1116 + 215 g140l spectrum has an absolute velocity uncertainty of @xmath350 , which corresponds to a redshift uncertainty of @xmath30.0002 .      to study the relationship between the absorbers and galaxies in the directions of h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 , we have conducted a survey of galaxy redshifts in the @xmath45 fields centered on the qsos using the fiber - fed multiobject spectrograph ( hydra ) on the wiyn telescope .",
    "the galaxy targets were selected primarily from ( 1 ) eleven 67 @xmath36 67 images in harris r clustered around h 1821 + 643 acquired with the wiyn imager in july 1995 , and ( 2 ) 1@xmath46 images obtained with the kpno schmidt telescope by b. jannuzi & r. green ( 1995 , private communication ) . for h 1821 + 643 ,",
    "a few additional targets from the poss ii database were observed to extend the angular coverage at the lowest redshifts .",
    "objects in the wiyn and schmidt images were selected and classified as stars or galaxies by b. jannuzi and a. tanner using focas ( tyson & jarvis 1979 ; valdes 1982 ) . our original objective was to measure the redshifts of all galaxies brighter than @xmath47 19 in the 1@xmath20 fields centered on the qsos ( estimates of completeness of the final sample are provided below ) .",
    "however , a galaxy redshift sample complete to @xmath48 19 will not provide many redshifts with @xmath49 0.2 .",
    "since the h 1821 + 643 sight line probes clouds out to  = 0.297 , we obtained the wiyn images for a deeper redshift survey near the center of the qso field .",
    "a full description of the wiyn observations and data reduction will be provided in a separate paper ( tripp et al .",
    "1998 ) ; here we provide a summary .",
    "the observations were carried out on several observing runs between august 1995 and april 1997 .",
    "for all runs we used the simmons camera with the 400 line mm@xmath34 `` blue '' grating and a tektronics 2048@xmath362048 ccd ( t2kc ) . for most of the runs",
    "we used the red fibers which subtend 2  on the sky .",
    "however , on one of the early runs we used the blue fibers which subtend 3  .",
    "this setup provided a resolution of 4.6   ( @xmath3300 km s@xmath34 ) with the red fibers or 7.1   ( @xmath3 450 km s@xmath34 ) with the blue fibers .",
    "to include the h & k lines at @xmath0 = 0 , the grating was positioned to provide spectra extending from 3900 to 7100  .",
    "we typically observed 60 - 75 candidate galaxies per setup with 10 - 30 fibers positioned on the sky .",
    "three 50 minute exposures were obtained for each fiber configuration .",
    "targets were given priority based on brightness and proximity to the qso .",
    "due to fiber positioning constraints , in some setups not all of the fibers could be placed on new targets , so previously observed galaxies were reobserved to improve the s / n .",
    "spectra of objects observed in multiple setups were coadded to obtain the final redshift , but the individual spectra were also measured to test the reliability and uncertainties of the redshift measurements ( see tripp et al.1998 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with iraf using the dohydra package .",
    "we then used the standard method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) to determine the galaxy redshifts by cross - correlating the target spectra with spectra of `` templates '' , i.e. , high s / n galaxy spectra with known redshifts , after masking out any emission lines or night sky residuals and passing both the target and the templates through a fourier bandpass filter .",
    "we used six templates for the cross - correlation measurements .",
    "the first template is a spectrum of m32 observed with hydra with one of the central fibers in the slit ( which have the highest throughput ) and reduced in an identical fashion to the target data reductions .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of m32 is 209  ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the other templates are actual targets in the h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 fields for which we obtained high s / n spectra , and the heliocentric velocities of these templates were established by cross - correlation with the m32 spectrum .",
    "the templates were intentionally selected to have a range of redshifts to check the reliability of the cross - correlation redshifts in marginal cases . for emission line galaxies ,",
    "the redshifts were measured using templates with absorption lines and night sky residuals masked out .",
    "the galaxy redshifts measured in the fields of h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 are summarized in tables  [ h1821reds ] and  [ p1116reds ] , respectively . we also list in these tables the poss ii @xmath50 magnitudes ( denoted @xmath51 since @xmath50 is roughly equivalent to @xmath52 ) and impact parameters ( projected distances from the sight line ) for each galaxy .",
    "the poss ii magnitudes have rms errors of @xmath30.21 magnitudes ( weir , djorgovski , & fayyad 1995 ) . since ccd calibration of the poss ii magnitudes was not available for these fields , we determined the magnitude zero - point by comparison to the measurements of kirhakos et al .",
    "absolute magnitudes calculated using the interstellar extinction corrections based on @xmath53 from lockman & savage ( 1995 ) and the k - correction from peebles ( 1993 ) are also provided in tables  [ h1821reds ] and  [ p1116reds ] .",
    "we have measured 98 redshifts in the field of h 1821 + 643 and 118 redshifts in the field of pg 1116 + 215 . for h 1821 + 643 ,",
    "we have obtained 56 additional redshifts from schneider et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , le brun , bergeron , & boiss ( 1996 ) , and bowen , pettini , & boyle ( 1998 ) , bringing the grand total to 154 .",

    "table  [ complete1116 ] provides estimates of the completeness of the pg 1116 + 215 galaxy redshift survey for various limiting magnitudes out to various radii based on the number of galaxy candidates in the schmidt catalog and the number of redshifts actually obtained",
    ". it will be important to consider the impact of the angular coverage of the galaxy redshift survey ( at low redshifts ) and its limited depth ( at high redshifts ) , so we also list in table  [ complete1116 ] the redshifts at which @xmath54 = 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 correspond to a 1@xmath55 galaxy [ using @xmath56 = 19.5 from loveday et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ] and the physical scale corresponding to a 10 , 20 , and 30 radius at each of these redshifts .",
    "for example , based on the schmidt catalog of targets within 20 of the qso , we estimate that the pg 1116 + 215 survey is 86.9% complete for @xmath57 19.0 .",
    "@xmath54 = 19 corresponds to a 1@xmath55 galaxy , and 20 corresponds to 2.4 mpc , at @xmath58 0.121 .",
    "the pg 1116 + 215 target list contained very little stellar contamination ; only six observed targets turned out to be stars . unfortunately , the h 1821 + 643 catalog suffered much more severe stellar contamination ; 64 observed candidates turned out to be stellar ( see tripp et al .",
    "this stellar contamination was partly due to the low latitude and direction of the qso ( @xmath594 ) which causes the sight line to pass over several spiral arms and through the warped part of the outer milky way ( see savage et al .",
    "1995 ) , but it was also partly due to the fact that we observed the h 1821 + 643 field first  experience gained from the h 1821 + 643 field was used to improve the star / galaxy separation procedure for pg 1116 + 215 . due to the large number of stars in the target list ,",
    "estimates of the h 1821 + 643 survey completeness are more uncertain .",
    "if we remove objects which are observed to be stars and objects for which we did not get good spectra but are probably stars ( based on magnitude and poss ii classification ) , then we estimate that within a 20 radius from the qso , the h 1821 + 643 redshift survey is roughly 72.4% complete for @xmath60 18.0 and 50.8% complete for @xmath60 20.0 .",
    "our survey is substantially more complete than the previous surveys noted above because any redshifts from those surveys which we missed were added to our sample .",
    "table  [ h1821reds ] shows that redshifts have been obtained for a number of galaxies as faint as @xmath61 21.0 in the h 1821 + 643 field .",
    "taking @xmath56 = 19.5 and the interstellar extinction and k - corrections described above , we find that @xmath62 21.0 corresponds to a roughly 0.5@xmath55 galaxy at @xmath0 = 0.20 .",

    "furthermore , most of the galaxies at @xmath64 0.2 for which we have obtained redshifts are in the rich galaxy cluster which hosts the qso , so our redshift survey is severely incomplete for intervening galaxies at @xmath64 0.2 .",

    "there are multiple absorption components near the 1454.84   line as well , but these occur at high positive velocities with different relative strengths than the components near the other lines ( see figure  [ h1821ism ] ) and thus are not due to .    the absorption line at 1414.41   may have a contribution from galactic 1414.40  .",

    "( 1997 ) have suggested that the fraction is even larger and that possibly all of the absorbers arise in such galaxies .",

    "( 1996 ) and bowen , blades , & pettini ( 1996 ) , but chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argue that le brun et al . and",
    "bowen et al .",
    "have effectively diluted the anticorrelation by including galaxy - absorber pairs at large impact parameters ( up to @xmath3 5 mpc ) which are unlikely to be physically associated .",
    "we can test the conclusions of lanzetta et al . because our galaxy samples include 42 galaxies with impact parameters @xmath126 600 kpc ( see tables  [ h1821reds ] and  [ p1116reds ] ) .",
    "however , we should exclude any galaxies and absorption lines which have  @xmath127 because ( 1 ) the absorbers with  @xmath128 are now recognized to be a special class of absorption systems ; in some cases there is clear evidence that these absorbers are close to the qso nucleus ( e.g. , hamann et al .",
    "1997a , b ; barlow & sargent 1997 ) , ( 2 ) these absorbers can be significantly photoionized by the qso itself ( the `` proximity effect '' ) , and ( 3 ) in the case of h 1821 + 643 , the qso is located in a rich galaxy cluster ( see figure  [ pie1821 ] and hall , ellingson , & green 1997 ) which is a special environment . for consistency with lanzetta",
    "et al . and",
    "chen et al .",
    ", we exclude objects within 3000  of the qso redshift .",
    "this leaves us with 20 galaxies with @xmath126 600 kpc in the fields of h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 .",
    "first consider the closer galaxies : if we find a galaxy with an impact parameter of 200 kpc or less , do we find a strong line at that redshift ?",
    "our sample is small  we only have three galaxies with impact parameters of 200 kpc or less  but in all three cases we find a strong line with @xmath25 300 m  within 150  of the galaxy redshift .",
    "furthermore , as we consider larger impact parameters , we continue to find nearby absorbers .",
    "in fact , all galaxies within projected distances of 600 kpc from the sight lines have associated absorbers with @xmath129 1000  ( @xmath130 is the mean of  and @xmath131 ) . in some cases there are several galaxies near the redshift of the cloud ; following chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we first assume that the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter is the most likely to be associated with the absorber ( we consider an alternate selection criterion below ) .",
    "this reduces our list of 20 close galaxies to 12 close galaxies .",
    "we also treat lines within 350  of each other as a single absorber .",
    "given these assumptions , we find 12 galaxy - absorber pairs with @xmath11 600 kpc and @xmath132 1000  ( 7 pairs toward h 1821 + 643 and 5 pairs toward pg 1116 + 215 ) .",
    "we have used @xmath133 1000  because this is the selection criterion originally employed by lanzetta et al .",
    "while there are situations which could lead to such high velocity gas flows in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , roettiger , stone , & mushotzky 1998 ; burns 1998 ) , in general @xmath133 1000  is a rather large velocity interval which corresponds to many mpc in an unperturbed hubble flow",
    ". therefore one might reasonably wonder if these 12 galaxy - absorber pairs are coincidental alignments of randomly distributed lines which occasionally happen to be close to a galaxy . to address this question ,",
    "we have used monte carlo simulations ( see  5.3 ) to randomly distribute lines along the h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 sightlines . based on 10000 monte carlo trials , we find that the probability of 7 chance galaxy - absorber pairs toward h 1821 + 643 and 5 chance pairs toward pg 1116 + 215 is 4.7@xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , nine of these 12 observed galaxy - absorber pairs have @xmath11 600 kpc and @xmath133 340 , and the probability of this occuring if the clouds are randomly distributed is 1.3@xmath135 , again based on 10000 monte carlo trials .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in the galaxy and cloud redshifts , it seems reasonable to attribute galaxy - absorber velocity differences of @xmath3350  to normal galaxy motions such as rotation .",
    "a similar corroborating result is obtained from the 3c 273 data obtained by morris et al .",
    "there are five galaxies 600 kpc in the 3c 273 sample , but four of these are in virgo at roughly the same redshift with @xmath136 = 0.0065 , and again we use the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter . ] in the sample of morris et al . with impact parameters of 600 kpc or less , and in all five cases",
    "there are clouds detected within 500 . in four out of the five 3c 273 close galaxy - absorber pairs ,",
    "the absorber is within 250  of the galaxy redshift . in all , there are 17 galaxies with @xmath11 600 kpc along the three sight lines ( 3c 273 , h 1821 + 643 , and pg 1116 + 215 ) ; every one of them has a corresponding absorption line with @xmath137 1000 , and 14 out of the 17 galaxies are within 500  of a line .",
    "this is a strong indication that absorbers are somehow associated with luminous galaxies but does not necessarily indicate that the absorption lines originate in the large gaseous halos of the identified individual luminous galaxies . the lines could be due to undetected faint dwarf galaxies which are clustered with the observed luminous galaxies , or they could be due to broadly distributed gas within the large scale structures where luminous galaxies are found , for example .",
    "since in some cases there are several galaxies close to a line of sight at a given absorber redshift ( see figures  [ pie1821 ] and  [ pie1116 ] ) , it is nt clear that the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter is the most likely one ( or the only one ) to be associated with the absorber ( as assumed above ) . in some cases",
    "the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter has a larger velocity separation from the absorber than another galaxy at a somewhat larger impact parameter .",
    "an alternative criterion for identifying galaxy - absorber pairs is to match absorbers with the galaxy with the smallest _ three - dimensional _ distance .",
    "assuming the perturbed hubble flow described above , this selection method leads to the identification of 17 galaxy - absorber pairs within projected distances of 1 mpc with @xmath138 350  in the h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 sight lines .",
    "these galaxy - absorber pairs are summarized in table  [ galx600 ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations indicate that the probability of drawing this many pairs from a randomly distributed population is 3.6@xmath10 .",
    "we now turn to the equivalent width - impact parameter anticorrelation which lanzetta et al .",
    "use to argue that the strong lines are truly due to luminous _",
    "individual _ galaxies .",
    "does this anticorrelation extend to larger impact parameters ?",
    "lanzetta et al . ( 1995 ) and chen et al . (",

    ", we have only included galaxies with impact parameters of 600 kpc or less .",
    "if we increase the impact parameter cutoff , we continue to find galaxies apparently associated with lines , be we also find some galaxies which do not have associated absorption lines , within @xmath137 1000 , of the strength expected from equation ( 3 ) .",
    "for example , a galaxy at @xmath131 = 0.18967 in the h 1821 + 643 field is at a projected distance of 635 kpc , and therefore from eqn .",
    "( 3 ) we expect to find a line with @xmath145 95 m  near this redshift , which should be easily detected . from figure  [ h1821grand ]",

    "pg 1116 + 215 , and 3c 273 sight lines , we find 15 cases of galaxies with 600 @xmath146 2200 kpc that do not have unambiguously associated lines within 1000 .",
    "however , five of these cases are at redshifts where the associated line could be hidden within strong ism lines or extragalactic lines .",
    "the remaining 10 cases which do not have associated lines are plotted as upper limits in figure  [ bigrhocor ] , which also shows all galaxies with @xmath147 2200 kpc that do have lines within 1000 .",
    "remarkably , using the sample shown in figure  [ bigrhocor ] , we find that the anticorrelation persists at high significance levels out to @xmath12 2200 kpc . there is a lot of scatter in the data shown in figure  [ bigrhocor ] , so the cases where we do not find associated lines may simply be cases where the line is weak enough to fall below our detection threshold ; the upper limits for these cases are consistent with the anticorrelation . if we select only galaxy - absorber pairs with @xmath126 2200 kpc and @xmath148 500 , the anticorrelation is still strong because there are only five galaxy - absorber pairs in figure  [ bigrhocor ] with 500 @xmath149 1000  ( the triangles encased in squares in figure  [ bigrhocor ] ) .",
    "this strong anticorrelation is another indication that the absorbers and galaxies shown in figure  [ bigrhocor ] are in some way physically related and may have important implications regarding the nature of the absorbers .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of the anticorrelation in  6 .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that there are some potential selection biases which could artificially tighten the anticorrelations shown in figures  [ rhocor ] and  [ bigrhocor ] .",
    "for example , the current galaxy redshift surveys only probe relatively bright galaxies ( see table  [ complete1116 ] ) , so there could be fainter galaxies at smaller impact parameters than those plotted in figure  [ bigrhocor ] that might be revealed by a deeper redshift survey .",
    "discovery of such galaxies would modify the appearance of figure  [ rhocor ] and weaken the anticorrelation by moving points from the lower right corner of figure  [ bigrhocor ] to the lower left corner of the plot .",
    "going deeper might also reveal close galaxies which do not have corresponding absorption .",
    "along these lines , linder ( 1998 ) has used simulations to argue that most absorbers could be due to faint galaxies rather than the observable luminous galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "some deep searches near the lowest redshift lines have not found such faint galaxies ( e.g. , morris et al .",
    "1993 ; van gorkom et al . 1993 ; rauch et al .",
    "1996 ) , but van gorkom et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and hoffman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have located faint dwarf galaxies at the redshifts of a few low @xmath0 lines .",
    "it will be important to do more deep searches for faint galaxies to establish whether or not the anticorrelation in figure  [ rhocor ] is real .",
    "another potential bias in figure  [ bigrhocor ] ( and in the analyses of lanzetta et al . and chen et al . ) may be introduced by the selection of _ only _ lines which are known to be within a certain projected distance and velocity of a galaxy . due to these selection criteria",

    "alternatively , these lines may not have known nearby galaxies because the nearest galaxy is outside of the angular extent of the redshift survey .",
    "if this is the case , then these missing galaxy - absorber pairs would have relatively large impact parameters and would fill in the upper right corner of figure  [ bigrhocor ] , and this would weaken the anticorrelation . to illustrate the possible impact of this selection effect , we plot on the far right side of figure  [ bigrhocor ] some of the missing lines from the chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample ( using equivalent widths reported by jannuzi et al . 1998 and bahcall et al . 1993 ) and the missing lines from our sight lines . from this",
    "we see that the missing lines could indeed substantially dilute the anticorrelation . to check to see if this selection bias is occuring , more galaxy redshift measurements are needed",

    "the galaxy survey of morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) revealed a similar cluster of galaxies at @xmath150 0.08 with no associated absorbers in the direction of 3c 273 .",
    "this may indicate that absorbers are destroyed ( or are not created in the first place ) in this type of environment .",
    "however , do we expect to see absorbers in these clusters based on the impact parameters of the nearest galaxies ?",
    "as already noted above , in the cluster at @xmath58 0.190 , there is a galaxy at a projected distance of 635 kpc and we should see an absorber there based on equation ( 3 ) . in the cluster at @xmath58 0.050 , the nearest galaxy has an impact parameter of 590 kpc , so we might expect a line at that redshift with @xmath151 100 m . in this case",
    "a line with the right strength is well - detected at the expected wavelength , but its identification is ambiguous since this absorption may be due to in the milky way ism ( see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "morris & van den bergh ( 1994 ) have shown that a substantial fraction of lines at low @xmath0 could be due to material stripped out of galaxies in tidal interactions , and they point out that in this model absorbers would be less likely to be found in rich clusters because ( 1 ) there are fewer gas - rich spirals , and ( 2 ) tidal debris should be less common due to the higher velocity dispersion of rich clusters . furthermore , rich galaxy clusters contain hot intracluster media , so clouds may be fully ionized in this environment .",
    "therefore it is not necessarily surprising to find that absorbers may avoid rich clusters .",
    "however , more sight lines crossing rich clusters must be studied to give this suggestive result statistical significance .",
    "we note that there is a strong cloud in the rich cluster which hosts h 1821 + 643 , but since this is a  @xmath152 absorber , this is a special case",

    "therefore more redshift measurements with broader angular coverage are needed to establish that these are truly void absorbers .",

    "we find a 14% probability that the void and non - void absorbers were drawn from the same equivalent width distribution .      in  5.2 we addressed the question : if there is a galaxy within some impact parameter , do we find a absorber near that redshift ?",

    "we selected 100 m  as the cutoff between the weak and strong absorbers because this divides the sample roughly in half ( 28 weak vs. 21 strong absorbers ) and because this is the cutoff used by stocke et al .",
    "table  [ ksweak ] lists the ks probabilities that the weak and strong absorbers are drawn from a random distribution .",
    "figure  [ cumweak ] and table  [ ksweak ] clearly show that _ neither the weak absorbers nor the strong absorbers are randomly distributed with respect to the galaxies in the survey .",
    "_ figure  [ cumweak ] also shows that the weaker absorbers are difficult to distinguish from the stronger absorbers , at least based on the nearest neighbor distribution with 100 m  delineating weak lines from strong .",
    "however , previous studies indicate that the cutoff between the hypothesized two populations of absorbers ( see  1 ) may be closer to 300 m  than 100 m .",
    "unfortunately , we have very few lines in our sample with @xmath25 300 m , so we can not apply the same test using 300 m  as the cutoff .",
    "however , the sparse data that we do have suggest that there is a difference between absorbers with @xmath25 300 m  and weaker absorbers , as expected from the anticorrelation discussed in  5.2 . for example , four out of six lines in the h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 spectra with @xmath25 300 m  ( not including lines within 3000  of the qso redshift ) have a nearby galaxy with @xmath155 200 kpc and @xmath137 300 , and the fifth has a galaxy at @xmath143 = 373 kpc and @xmath156 = 246 .",
    "the only line with @xmath25 300 m  that does not have a nearby galaxy is at @xmath64 0.2 toward h 1821 + 643 where the galaxy redshift survey is very incomplete .",
    "in contrast , out of the 41 remaining lines with @xmath26 300 m , only two have @xmath155 200 kpc and @xmath137 300 , and these are both within 350  of a strong line with @xmath25 300 m  ( see tables  [ h1821near ] and  [ p1116near ] ) . if we divide the sample into lines with @xmath25 200 m  and @xmath26 200 m , we obtain the nearest neighbor distributions shown in figure  [ weak200 ] and the statistical results in the lower half of table  [ ksweak ] . while figure  [ weak200 ] does suggest that there is a difference between the weaker and stronger lines , the difference has a marginal statistical significance ; a ks test indicates that there is a 6.5% probability that the weaker and stronger absorbers in figure  [ weak200 ] are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "however , there are only 9 lines in the sample with with @xmath25 200 m . clearly more observations are needed .",
    "in this section we discuss the implications of our results for the relationship between absorbers and galaxies . to facilitate the discussion , we first summarize the main results of our study in the context of earlier studies :    \\(1 ) the distribution of absorbers in space is not random but rather is correlated with the distribution of galaxies as found previously ( morris et al . 1993 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "a new result of this work is that , because of our larger sample of weak absorption lines , we find that even the very weak absorbers ( @xmath15 100 m ) are correlated with the galaxy distribution . on the other hand , the correlation between galaxies and absorbers is not as strong as the correlation between galaxies themselves ( morris et al .",
    "1993 ; mo & morris 1994 ; stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; lanzetta et al 1997 ) .",
    "there appears to be marginal evidence that the weak absorption lines are less correlated with the galaxy distribution than the strong absorption lines , but the difference is not yet significant .",
    "\\(2 ) earlier work by lanzetta and co - workers ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) showed that luminous galaxies at impact parameters @xmath7 200 kpc frequently have corresponding absorption lines .",
    "they also suggested that galaxies at impact parameters greater than 200 kpc are almost never associated with corresponding absorption lines .",
    "however , we find that all galaxies within 600 kpc of the quasar sightlines do have corresponding absorption with @xmath137 1000 , and a significant number of galaxies at 600 @xmath157 2200 kpc have corresponding absorption lines with @xmath137 1000 . furthermore , most of these galaxy - absorber pairs are separated by less than @xmath3350 .",
    "these different conclusions result mostly from the fact that the absorption lines tend to be weak for galaxies with large impact parameters , and the fos spectra used by lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are not sufficiently sensitive to detect these weak lines .",
    "\\(3 ) it was shown by lanzetta and co - workers ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995,1997 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 ) that the equivalent widths of the absorption lines are anticorrelated with the impact parameters to galaxies for impact parameter up to 200 kpc and @xmath111 up to 500 .",
    "we find that the same relation extends to impact parameters as large as @xmath32 mpc for @xmath137 1000 .",
    "in addition , there is no noticeable increase in the scatter around the mean anticorrelation relation going from small @xmath143 to large @xmath143 ( see figure  [ bigrhocor ] ) , while increasingly large scatter with increasing @xmath143 might be expected if the absorbers and the galaxies are physically related at small impact parameters but are less physically related at larger projected distances .",
    "however , there are potential selection effects which can artificially tighten this anticorrelation , and follow - up studies are needed to determine whether or not it is real .",
    "\\(4 ) some prominent groups of galaxies do not have clearly associated lines .",
    "however other galaxy groups do have associated absorbers .",
    "evidently absorbers do not always avoid regions of higher galaxy density , but they may avoid the densest regions .",
    "\\(5 ) dividing the absorbers into `` void '' and `` non - void '' absorbers based on whether or not there is a galaxy within 3 mpc in 3-dimensional space , assuming a perturbed hubble flow for the determination of radial distance , we find that the equivalent width distributions of void and non - void absorbers are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "there are two main competing interpretations of the relationship between galaxies and absorbers at low redshifts .",
    "lanzetta and co - workers ( e.g. , lanzetta et al .",
    "1995,1997 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 ) have suggested that low redshift absorbers ( mostly strong absorption lines with @xmath5 300 m ) are physically associated with individual galaxies which are surrounded by extended gaseous envelopes of @xmath3200 kpc radius of unknown geometry which give rise to the observed absorption .",
    "two main arguments are cited in support of the physical association interpretation : ( 1 ) the galaxy - absorber cross - correlation function appears to be strong for @xmath147 200 kpc and @xmath137 500  and is much weaker at larger impact parameters and velocity separations ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ( 2 ) there is an anticorrelation between absorber equivalent width and impact parameter for galaxy - absorber pairs that are likely to be physically associated ( chen et al .",
    "1998 ) , where `` physically associated '' pairs refer to those with galaxy - absorber cross - correlation significantly above zero ( essentially galaxy - absorber pairs with @xmath147 200 kpc and @xmath137 500 ) .",
    "the latter point suggests that the density of the gas distribution near galaxies drops off with increasing galactocentric radius . some independent support for this picture",
    "is provided by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who conclude , based on the velocity dispersion of satellites around isolated spiral galaxies , that the dark matter halos of spirals have radii @xmath158 200 kpc .    however , there are difficulties with the gaseous halo interpretation ( see , e.g. ,  5 in stocke et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it is difficult to understand how galaxies would be able to maintain such large gaseous halos  such halos would probably be weakly bound and vulnerable to disruption by interactions in groups and clusters .",
    "our finding that the equivalent width versus impact parameter anticorrelation extends to impact parameters as large as @xmath3600 kpc and may extend to several mpc further aggrevates the problem and challenges the lanzetta et al . interpretation .",
    "in addition , there are several instances in our sample and elsewhere ( e.g. , rauch et al .",
    "1996 ) in which a group of galaxies within a few 100  of each other with separations comparable to the impact parameter to the nearest galaxy appear to be responsible for the same absorption . as noted by rauch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the `` cloud size '' or `` coherence length '' of absorbers inferred by dinshaw et al .",
    "( 1995,1997 ) from common lines detected toward qso pairs ,",
    "@xmath3700 kpc , is much larger than the transverse separation between galaxies so it is doubtful that the large cloud size could refer to absorption produced by a single galactic halo or disk .",
    "rather , the large transverse sizes and small velocity differences of common absorbers measured by dinshaw et al . appear to favor spatially coherent and rather quiescent gaseous structures on scales significantly larger than the virial radii of individual galaxies .",
    "an alternative to the lanzetta et al .",
    "interpretation is that , rather than being associated with individual galaxies , the absorbers trace the large scale structures in which both galaxies and gas reside .",
    "recent cosmological simulations of structure formation involving gas hydrodynamics suggest a picture in which galaxies are surrounded and connected by filamentary or sheet - like gaseous structures .",
    "such structures have properties which are consistent with the absorption lines at @xmath0 = 2- 4 , as has been shown by a number of recent studies ( e.g. , cen et al .",
    "1994 ; petitjean , mcket , & kates 1995 ; miralda - escud et al . 1996",
    "; hernquist et al . 1996",
    "; zhang et al .",
    "1997,1998 ) .",
    "in these simulations , the density of the gas distribution drops with increasing distance from galaxies , and often even void regions contain enough gas to produce absorption lines , albeit with much lower column densities .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the overall structure of the gas distribution at @xmath0 = 0 will remain similar to that at @xmath159 2 , although the amount of gas in void regions and in the filamentary structures should decrease as the gas `` drains '' through the filaments into galaxies .",
    "the association of absorbers with large scale structures appears to be consistent with all of the observational evidence obtained so far for low @xmath0 absorbers .",
    "the distribution of absorbers is obviously correlated with that of galaxies because they trace the same large scale structures , but clearly the absorber - galaxy correlation function will be weaker than the galaxy - galaxy correlation function . since most ( if not all ) galaxies are likely to be engulfed by diffuse gas in the filamentary structures , an absorption line is likely to be found when a galaxy is near the qso sightline ( result ( 2 ) above ) .",
    "the anticorrelation between absorber equivalent width and impact parameter and the persistence of such an anticorrelation to very large impact parameters can also be understood in analogy with the simulations at large redshift ; the density of the gas distribution is expected to decrease on average as one moves away from galaxies . however , since the gas distribution is not regular and smooth , a large scatter in this anticorrelation relation is expected , as observed ( see figures  [ rhocor ] and  [ bigrhocor ] ) .",
    "chen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) attemped to reduce the scatter in the equivalent width vs impact parameter relation by incorporating various galaxy properties as a secondary parameter , such as galaxy luminosity , mean surface brightness , effective radius , disk - to - bulge ratio , redshift , and shape of the gas distribution ; only marginal improvement in the relation was found even in the best case when galaxy b - band luminosity was incorporated into the relation to 4.2 - 5.9@xmath4 , depending on the statistical test applied . ] .",
    "the apparent insensitivity of this relation to galaxy properties is naturally explained if the absorption arises from the overall large scale structure rather than in individual galaxies .",
    "some absorption lines should also occur when the quasar sightlines pass through regions in the large scale structure that are relatively far ( many mpc ) away from galaxies , where there may still be gas either in filaments or in the voids .",
    "this is consistent with result ( 5 ) , namely , the equivalent width distributions of void and non - void absorbers are statistically indistinguishable",
    ". however , the absorption lines arising from regions in space far away from galaxies should , to some degree , be weaker on average .",
    "a much larger line sample is required to search for such a trend .",
    "a third interpretation of the absorbers is that the lines are associated with faint dwarf galaxies which may be able to generate large ( @xmath3100 kpc ) gaseous halos via supernova - driven winds ( wang 1995 ; nath & trentham 1997 ) . at low @xmath0 , this interpretation has gained support from the 21 cm imaging study of van gorkom et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which has located gas - rich dwarf galaxies at the redshift of some low @xmath0 lines .",
    "there are some potential problems with this interpretation .",
    "first , the dwarf galaxies are usually more than @xmath3100 kpc from the sight lines .",
    "several sensitive imaging searches for very faint galaxies in the vicinity of the two lowest - redshift absorbers toward 3c 273 have failed to find faint galaxies within 100 kpc of the sight line ( e.g. , morris et al .",
    "1993 ; van gorkom et al . 1993",
    "; rauch et al . 1996 ) .",
    "by searching a somewhat larger field , salzer ( 1992 ) and hoffman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found two dwarf galaxies at projected distances of @xmath3200 kpc near the lowest redshift 3c 273 absorber .",
    "hoffman et al . (",
    "1998 ) have measured the rotation curve of one of these dwarfs , and they show that extension of the observed rotation curve can not explain the velocity of the associated absorber ( see their figure 6 ) , but this may not be surprising if the line is due to a galactic wind .",
    "a second criticism of the dwarf galaxy model of absorbers stems from the recent study of martin ( 1998 ) .",
    "martin ( 1998 ) has explored the likelihood that dwarf galaxies will drive galactic winds by surveying the expansion rates and sizes of their h@xmath16 shells .",
    "she concludes that `` many of the shells will breakthrough the surrounding layer supersonically , but the projected expansion speeds are typically less than the lower limits on the escape velocity . ''",
    "martin notes that in a few objects in her sample ( e.g. , ngc 1569 , see also heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) , an unbound galactic wind is likely , but since she has exclusively selected dwarfs with prominent shells and only @xmath325% of dwarf galaxies show prominent h@xmath16 filaments ( hunter , hawley , & gallagher 1993 ) , her study seems to suggest that the majority of nearby dwarf galaxies will not drive winds .",
    "since many recent studies have shown that galaxy clusters and large scale structures contain large numbers of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , phillipps et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) and since gallagher , littleton , & matthews ( 1995 ) and phillipps et al .",
    "have shown that in these structures the distribution of the dwarfs tends to be more spatially extended than that of the giant galaxies , it seems more likely that lines with dwarfs 100 - 200 kpc away are due to gas in the large scale structures where the dwarfs are found rather than the dwarfs themselves .",
    "the hypothesis that many low redshift absorption lines with @xmath160 in the range from 50 to @xmath3500 m  trace the overall gas distribution in the large scale structures rather than gaseous halos of individual galaxies is physically plausible and is consistent with existing observations .",
    "however , it is probably true that a variety of phenomena cause absorption lines in qso spectra .",
    "the gaseous disks and halos of individual galaxies will certainly produce absorption if the qso sight line passes close enough , and these will probably be stronger lines .",
    "additional studies at low redshift should ultimately allow the determination of all sites of origin for this important tracer of cosmic phenomena .",
    "we have obtained high signal - to - noise uv spectra of the qsos h 1821 + 643 ( @xmath161 = 0.297 ) and pg 1116 + 215 ( @xmath161 = 0.177 ) with the ghrs in order to study the nature of low @xmath0 absorbers and their relationship with galaxies .",
    "the spectra have s / n ranging from 75 to 160 per 150  resolution element and permit the detection of weak lines . toward h",
    "1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 we find 26 and 13 lines , respectively , with 3@xmath4 rest equivalent widths @xmath5 50 m  ( not including lines within 3000  of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the previous best studied sight line for lines as weak as 50 m , 3c 273 , showed 13 lines with @xmath5 50 m  at 3@xmath4 significance or better ( morris et al .",
    "we have also measured 98 and 118 galaxy redshifts in the @xmath8 fields centered on h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 with the multiobject spectrograph on the wiyn telescope . with 56 additional redshifts from the literature",
    ", we have a total of 154 redshifts in the h 1821 + 643 field . within a 20 radius from the qso",
    ", we estimate that our h 1821 + 643 and pg 1116 + 215 redshift surveys are respectively 72.4% and 85.0% complete for @xmath60 18.0 and 50.8% and 68.5% complete for @xmath60 20.0 .",
    "\\(2 ) several of the stronger profiles show complex multiple component structure , but there is no compelling evidence of clustering in the two - point velocity correlation function of the whole sample . however",
    ", if we exclude the weakest lines ( @xmath15 100 m ) , the two - point correlation function shows a marginal signal ( 3@xmath4 ) on velocity scales of @xmath3500 .",
    "\\(3 ) all galaxies within projected distances of 600 @xmath9 kpc have associated absorbers with @xmath137 1000 , and the equivalent widths are anticorrelated at high significance with the projected distance of the nearest galaxy out to @xmath12 600 @xmath9 kpc .",
    "further studies are needed to establish whether this anticorrelation is real or due to selection effects . for @xmath163 kpc , we find galaxies which do not have associated lines .",
    "however , the anticorrelation continues to @xmath164 mpc for galaxies within 500 or 1000  of a absorber .",
    "most of these galaxy - absorber pairs have @xmath165 350 .",
    "\\(5 ) as in previous studies , we find lines in voids at large distances from the nearest galaxies , but this may be due to the limited spatial coverage ( at low @xmath0 ) or limited depth ( at high @xmath0 ) of the galaxy redshift survey .",
    "statistically , the equivalent width distributions of the void and non - void absorbers are indistinguishable , but the sample is small .",
    "\\(6 ) statistical tests show that the absorbers are not randomly distributed with respect to the galaxies . splitting the sample into roughly equal groups of weak ( @xmath15 100 m ) and strong absorbers",
    "shows that the weak absorbers are also not randomly distributed .",
    "comparison of the nearest neighbor distances of the weak and strong absorbers suggests that the weak absorbers may be less closely associated with galaxies than the strong absorbers , but with the small sample this difference is not yet statistically significant .",
    "\\(7 ) the observations are consistent with the hypothesis that many of the low redshift absorbers with rest equivalent widths in the range from 50 to @xmath3500 m  trace the overall gas distributions in the large scale structures in which galaxies reside rather than the gaseous halos of individual galaxies .",

    "<S> to study the nature of low @xmath0 absorbers in the spectra of qsos , we have obtained high signal - to - noise uv spectra of h 1821 + 643 ( @xmath1 = 0.297 ) and pg 1116 + 215 ( @xmath2 = 0.177 ) with the goddard high resolution spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope_. the spectra have minimum s / n @xmath3 70 - 100 and 3@xmath4 limiting equivalent widths of 50 - 75 m  at a resolution of @xmath3150 . excluding lines within 3000  of @xmath2 , we detect 26 lines with @xmath5 50 m  toward h 1821 + 643 and 13 toward pg 1116 + 215 ( comparable to the 13 lines observed toward 3c 273 by morris et al . ) , which implies a density of 102@xmath616 lines per unit redshift for @xmath5 50 m  and  @xmath7 0.28 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - point velocity correlation function shows marginal evidence of clustering of lines on @xmath3500  scales , but only if the weakest lines are excluded .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also used the wiyn observatory to measure galaxy redshifts in the @xmath8 fields centered on each qso in order to study the relationship between the absorbers and galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find 17 galaxy - absorber pairs within projected distances of 1 @xmath9 mpc with velocity separations of 350  or less . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations show that if the lines are randomly distributed , the probability of observing this many close pairs on the two sight lines is 3.6@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that _ all _ galaxies with projected distances @xmath11 600 @xmath9 kpc from the qso sight lines have associated absorbers within 1000 , and the majority of these galaxies have absorbers within 350 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the equivalent width is anticorrelated with the projected distance of the nearest galaxy out to at least @xmath12 600 @xmath9 kpc . for @xmath13 600@xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> kpc , we find galaxies which do not have associated lines , but nevertheless the anticorrelation persists if we select galaxies with @xmath14 2 @xmath9 mpc which are within 500 or 1000  of a absorber . </S>",
    "<S> this anticorrelation has a high significance but should be interpreted cautiously because there are potential selection biases which could lead to an artificial correlation . </S>",

    "<S> comparison of the nearest neighbor distances of the weaker and stronger absorbers suggests that the weakest absorbers are less closely associated with galaxies , but the difference is not yet statistically significant . </S>",
    "<S> we find several galaxy groups which do not have clearly associated absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the projected distance of the nearest galaxy , we do not necessarily expect to find detectable lines in these groups based on the equivalent width - projected distance anticorrelation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find several counterexamples of comparable galaxy groups which _ do _ have associated lines . as in previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> we find some absorbers in regions apparently devoid of galaxies , although this may be due to the limited spatial extent and/or limited depth of the redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width distributions of the absorbers apparently in voids and non - void absorbers are statistically indistinguishable , but the sample is small . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the nature of the absorbers in light of the new data . </S>",
    "<S> the observations are consistent with the hypothesis that many of the low redshift absorption lines with rest equivalent widths in the range from 50 to @xmath3500 m  trace the overall gas distributions in the large scale structures of galaxies rather than the gaseous halos of individual galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> other phenomena may also cause absorption lines .    . </S>"
