    "therefore , there is no phase transition for these black holes .",
    "interestingly for case of @xmath122 , the condition for having a positive critical horizon radius will be @xmath124 and @xmath125 . by employing",
    "obtained value for critical horizon radius , one can find critical temperature and pressure in the following forms @xmath126 @xmath127    considering obtained values , one can show that following equality is hold @xmath128which shows that in this case , @xmath129 is a function of massive parameter and coefficients . using obtained critical values ( eqs .",

    "also , we observed that contrary to gauss - bonnet case , @xmath129 is a function of massive gravity .",
    "in this section , we employ the geometrical concept for studying thermodynamical behavior of the obtained solutions . in order to do so ,",
    "we employ hpem method . in this method ,",
    "the thermodynamical phase space is constructed by considering mass of the black holes as thermodynamical potential . by doing so",

    "the divergencies of the ricci scalar are matched with phase transition points of the heat capacity .",
    "an interesting characteristic behavior of the diagrams is the different divergencies for different types of phase transition . in case of larger to smaller black holes phase transition , the divergency of the ricci scalar is toward @xmath141 ( compare fig . [ fig2 ] left panel with fig .",

    "these results are consistent with ordinary thermodynamical concepts and indicates that these three pictures ( phase diagrams , heat capacity and geometrical thermodynamics ) are in agreement .",
    "the final section of this paper is devoted to calculation of the critical pressure in extended phase space by using denominator of the heat capacity .",
    "it was shown that one can calculate critical pressures that were obtained in section ( @xmath145 ) by using denominator of the heat capacity @xcite .",
    "to do so , one should replace the cosmological constant in denominator of the heat capacity ( [ heat ] ) with its corresponding pressure ( [ p ] ) . then , solve the denominator of the heat capacity with respect to pressure .",
    "this will lead into following relation @xmath146    obtained relation for pressure is different from what was obtained through use of temperature ( [ pp ] ) . in this relation , the maximum(s ) of pressure and its corresponding horizon radius are critical pressure and horizon radius in which phase transition takes place .",

    "( [ pnew ] ) , we plot following diagram ( fig .",

    "the thermodynamical concept that was mentioned in last section ( pressure being smaller than critical pressure leads to existence of two phase transitions and for pressures larger than critical pressure no divergency is observed ) is also hold in case of this approach .",
    "in other words , this approach is an additional method for studying critical behavior of the system and the results of this approach is consistent with gts , heat capacity and extended phase space .",
    "in this paper , we have considered en - massive gravity in presence of bi nonlinear electromagnetic field .",
    "it was shown that considering this configuration leads to modification of the number and place of horizons that black holes can acquire .",
    "in other words , cases of multiple horizons were observed with different phenomenologies .",
    "next , conserved and thermodynamical quantities were obtained and it was shown that first law of thermodynamics hold for these black holes .",
    "next , we studied the thermodynamical behavior of the system .",
    "it was shown that temperature in the presence and absence of massive gravity presents different behaviors . adding massive put limitations on values that temperature",
    "can acquire , while , there was no limitation for temperature in the absence of it .",
    "interestingly , this behavior was modified in the presence of strong nonlinearity parameter . in strong nonlinearity parameter ,",
    "the behavior of temperature returned to a massive - less like behavior but the effects of the massive were observed in existences of extrema .",
    "it was also seen , that in case of different dimensions , for each pair of dimensions , one can find a point in which temperature for both dimensions are equal .",
    "regarding the stability , it was seen that in the presence of massive gravity , black holes enjoy one phase transition of the smaller unstable to larger stable .",
    "the phase transition was related to the divergency of heat capacity .",
    "then again , in strong nonlinearity parameter , this behavior was modified . in this case ,",
    "black holes had three phase transitions of smaller non - physical unstable to larger physical stable ( in place of root ) , larger unstable to smaller stable ( in place of smaller divergency ) and smaller unstable to larger stable ( in place of larger divergency ) .",
    "clearly , one can conclude that nonlinear electromagnetic field has an opposing effect comparing to massive gravity .",
    "strong nonlinearity parameter modifies the effects of the massive gravity and return the system to the massive - less like behavior , although the effects of massive still observed through extrema .",
    "it was pointed out that at maximums of the temperature , larger unstable to smaller stable and at minimums , smaller unstable to larger stable phase transitions take place .",
    "therefore , studying temperature provides an independent picture for studying phase transitions and stability of the solutions .",
    "next , we extended phase space by considering cosmological constant as thermodynamical variable known as pressure . it was shown that volume of the black holes is independent of generalization of the electromagnetic field and extension of the massive gravity .",
    "obtained values where critical points in which phase transitions took place .",
    "it was shown that the effects of variation of nonlinearity parameter was opposite of the massive parameter .",
    "in other words , these two factors put restrictions on each others effects .",
    "interestingly , in ref .",
    "@xcite variation of massive gravity highly modified the critical temperature and pressure . in case of obtained solutions in this paper ,",
    "the modification was not as considerable as what was observed in case of gauss - bonnet - maxwell - massive black holes .",
    "this shows that generalization of electromagnetic field puts stronger restrictions on the effects of the massive gravity . in other words , in order to have stronger control over contributions of the massive gravity one should increase the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic sector .",
    "in addition , a study in context of neutral solutions was conducted .",
    "it was shown that due to contribution of the massive gravity , the chargeless solutions of this gravity also enjoy the existence of phase transition .",
    "in other words , black holes in en - massive gravity go under phase transitions in extended phase space .",
    "also , it was shown that ratio of @xmath149 was a function of massive gravity .",
    "it was also pointed out that in @xmath150-dimensions , contrary to case of gauss - bonnet black holes , these black holes enjoy second order phase transition .",
    "in addition , it was shown that in case of @xmath121 , no phase transition for massive black holes is observed .",
    "next , geometrical approach was used for studying critical behavior of the system in context of heat capacity and extended phase space .",
    "it was shown that employed metrics for both cases have consistent results and follow the concepts of ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "the characteristic behavior of divergencies in ricci scalar of the geometrical thermodynamical metrics , enabled us to recognize the type of phase transition ( smaller to larger or larger to smaller ) .",
