    "the b9psi star cu vir ( hd 124224 , @xmath0  =  052 , e.g. weiss et al . 1976 ) , has an amplitude of the effective magnetic field curve of about 1000 gauss and shows very large spectral variations of helium and silicon .",
    "relations between the structure of the magnetic field and the distribution of some chemical elements on the stellar surface should exist according to , e.g. , michaud ( 1970 ) , glagolevskij ( 1994 ) , and hatzes ( 1997 ) . for our investigation",
    "we use the values of the longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath1 , measured photoelectrically by borra and landstreet ( 1980 ) and the distribution of he , si , and mg over the stellar surface derived by goncharskij et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , and hatzes ( 1997 ) .",
    "the magnetic field structure has been calculated on the assumption that the variation of the @xmath1 values observed is caused by a dipole - quadrupole configuration of the magnetic field and the model of the oblique rotator .",
    "1 represents the observations ( dots ) of cu vir versus the rotational phase .",
    "the points differ distinctly from a sinusoidal curve , which would exist for a dipole field . +    for the magnetic field modelling we take the angle @xmath2  =  60  between the rotation axis and the line of sight and we set the angle @xmath3 = 65 , describing the inclination between the rotation axis and the dipole axis .",
    "the magnetic sources are located at @xmath4  =  0.1 from the centre and produce at the stellar surface the magnetic field strengths of the dipole of + 1.5 and @xmath51.5 kg and of the quadrupole of + 3.1 , @xmath53.1 , + 3.1 , and @xmath53.1   kg .",
    "the calculated variation of @xmath1  is represented in fig . 1 .",
    "[ [ he ] ] he ~~    we have taken the distribution of he over the stellar surface from hiesberger et al . (",
    "1995 ) and kuschnig et al .",
    "the he spots obviously coincide with the regions of the maximal field strength .",
    "differences between the distribution maps quoted above occur especially in the region of the broad positive magnetic maximum .",
    "the solution of hiesberger et al . appears to be closer to the magnetic field structure derived from our model . in the vicinity of the maximal negative pole only a weak he spot exists .",
    "an explanation could be that we observe only the edge of a large spot , but this spot is practically invisible because of the large inclination of the star .      to search for a relation between the magnetic field and the element si we use the si map distributions of goncharskij et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , kuschnig et al . (",
    "1997 ) , and hatzes ( 1997 ) .",
    "only a general tendency can be seen : the si abundance is lower in the region of the broad positive maximum , whereas in the region of the negative magnetic field extremum the abundance seems to be higher .",
    "+ alcian and vauclair ( 1981 ) and mgessier ( 1984 ) have shown the importance of the horizontal component of the diffusion velocity in magnetic ap stars .",
    "they postulated an overabundance of si in these regions . to test these suggestions we calculated the isolines of the horizontal magnetic field lines from our dipole - quadrupole model . comparing with hatzes",
    "si map a concentration of this element in the areas with the horizontal direction of the magnetic field lines seems possible . + the behaviour of mg ,",
    "of which only the distribution map of goncharskij et al .",
    "is known , is obviously quite similar to that of si .",
    "our dipole - quadrupole model yields two maxima at the positive halfwave of the magnetic field and a very satisfactory agreement between the calculated and the observed behaviour of @xmath1 .",
    "we are not able to fit the strong anharmonic variation of @xmath1  by a decentred dipole field .",
    "the two observed he spots seem to support the assumption of a dipole - quadrupole configuration . + the maps proposed for si allow to explain the element distribution over the surface by a concentration of the element at the magnetic poles as well as in the regions where the magnetic field lines have a horizontal direction . to overcome the existing discrepancies , more accurate observations are necessary .",
