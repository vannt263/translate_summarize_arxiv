    "in this video ( ref ) , we show that when a liquid drop impacts a powder which is superhydrophobic , the drop rebounds with a powder coating that can `` freeze '' the oscillations and yield a deformed ( i.e. non - spherical ) liquid marble . for water drops ,",
    "the critical impact speed for the onset of this phenomenon is @xmath0 m / s .",
    "repeat experiments with more viscous drops show even more deformed shapes ."
