    "the standard model ( sm ) provides a remarkably successful description of known phenomena . on the other hand",

    "one of the solution for the hierarchy problem is found in the higher dimensional theory @xcite . in the scenario",
    "the sm scale can be obtained from the ratio between the planck scale and the size of the extra dimension .",
    "randall and sundrum proposed an alternative approach to solve the hierarchy problem in a five - dimensional curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "they considered the five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime compactified on an orbifold , @xmath5 , and two 3-branes existing at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "the 3-branes are four - dimensional subspaces embedded in the five - dimensional spacetime .",
    "it was shown that the spacetime metric satisfies the einstein equation and the electroweak scale @xmath6(tev ) is derived from the planck scale @xmath7 without introducing any very large parameters .    in the beginning",
    "it is considered that the sm particles are constrained on the 3-brane .",
    "but there is a possibility the sm particles also propagate in an extra dimension , i.e. bulk sm .",
    "goldberger and wise pointed out that the bulk scalar fields have modes whose mass terms are exponentially suppressed on a brane as well as the brane particles @xcite .",
    "we can identify the lightest modes of bulk fields to be the sm particles .",

    "the dynamical mass generation , for example top quark condensation @xcite in extra dimensions @xcite , is an appealing alternative scenario .",
    "it has been known that the spacetime curvature plays an important role to dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "a four - fermion interaction model is studied in the rs background as a prototype model of dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite . the dynamical origin to generate the low mass fermion is found by assuming the existence of the strong interaction between the bulk fermion and the brane fermion .",
    "gauge theories is also considered in the rs background by using the schwinger - dyson equation @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that the strong interaction is naturally appears in the gauge theory .",

    ".    dynamical origin of the low mass fermion is discussed in some models with brane fermions . in the present paper",
    "we study the possibility to generate the low fermion mass dynamically starting from the theory only with the bulk fermion . assuming the four - fermion like interaction between the bulk fermions , we evaluate the phase structure and the natural mass scale of the model .",

    "it is always a massless fermion because there is no chiral partners in the induced four - dimensional spacetime .",
