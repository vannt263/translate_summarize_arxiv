    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the best motivated theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) . not only",
    "does it provide a natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , but also gives a dynamical mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and a natural candidate for dark matter .",
    "the most recent lower bound on the higgs boson mass has been raised to 114.4 gev @xcite .",
    "this in fact puts some stress on the soft susy parameters , known as the little hierarchy problem , on the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "since the higgs boson receives radiative corrections dominated by the top squark loop , the mass bound requires the top squark mass to be heavier than 1 tev . from the renormalization - group ( rg ) equation of @xmath1 , the magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the parameters in the higgs potential are fine - tuned at a level of a few percent in order to obtain a higgs boson mass of @xmath3 gev .",
    "such fine - tuning has motivated a number of solutions to relieve the problem .",
    "one of these is to add additional singlet fields to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . the minimal version of the latter",
    "is realized by adding a singlet higgs field to the mssm , and becomes the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in some corners of the parameter space , the higgs boson can decay into a pair of very light pseudoscalars such that the lep2 limit can be evaded .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the fine - tuning or the little hierarchy problems are relieved @xcite .",
    "the nmssm is in fact well motivated as it provides an elegant solution to the @xmath4 problem in susy .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter in the term @xmath5 of the superpotential of the mssm naturally has its value at either @xmath6 or zero ( due to a symmetry ) .",
    "however , the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions require the @xmath4 parameter to be of the same order as @xmath7 for fine - tuning reasons .",
    "such a conflict is coined as the @xmath4 problem @xcite . in the nmssm ,",
    "the @xmath4 term is generated dynamically through the vacuum - expectation - value ( vev ) , @xmath8 , of the scalar component of the additional higgs field @xmath9 , which is naturally of the order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "thus , an effective @xmath4 parameter of the order of the electroweak scale is generated .",
    "explicitly , the superpotential of the nmssm is given by @xmath10 it is well - known that that the superpotential has a discrete @xmath11 symmetry , which may induce the harmful domain - wall effect @xcite .",
    "one possible way out is to introduce some nonrenormalizable operators at the planck scale that break the @xmath11 symmetry through the harmless tadpoles that they generate  @xcite .    once the domain wall problem is solved , the nmssm is phenomenologically very interesting . with the additional singlet higgs field ,",
    "there are one more cp - even and one more cp - odd higgs bosons , and one more neutralino other than those in the mssm .",
    "the higgs phenomenology is much richer @xcite , and so does the neutralinos @xcite .",
    "one particular feature of the nmssm is the allowable light pseudoscalar boson @xmath12 , which is consistent with existing data .",
    "since this @xmath12 mainly comes from the singlet higgs field , it can escape all the experimental constraints when the mixing angle with the mssm higgs fields goes to zero .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that even in the zero mixing limit , there is always a sm - like higgs boson that decays into a pair of @xmath12 s , which helps the higgs boson to evade the lep bound .",
    "the possibility to detect such light pseudoscalar higgs bosons coming from the @xmath13 decay was studied using the two photon mode of the @xmath12 , but the two photons may be too collimated for realistic detection @xcite .",
    "another possibility to detect such an almost decoupling case is to search for the four tau - leptons coming from @xmath14 decay @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the large @xmath15 and large @xmath16 limits , the mixing angle is extremely small and approaching zero , such that the decay of @xmath12 into tau - leptons or heavy quarks is negligible .    in this work ,",
    "we probe another novel signature in the zero - mixing limit .",
    "the unique term @xmath0 in the superpotential gives rise to the coupling of @xmath17 , which includes the neutral and charged higgsinos .",
    "we study the associated production of a light pseudoscalar higgs boson with a chargino pair in the zero - mixing limit at the lhc and ilc .",
    "provided that the pseudoscalar is very light and the mixing angle is less than @xmath18 , the dominant decay mode of @xmath12 is a pair of photons .",
    "thus , the novel signature for the production is a pair of charged leptons and a pair of photons plus large missing energy .",
    "such a signal can distinguish nmssm from the mssm .",
    "we will show the production rates at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "one critical issue in identifying the two - photon decay of the light pseudoscalar higgs boson is whether the two photons can be resolved .",
    "we will demonstrate the distribution of the opening angle between the two photons , from which one can tell to what extent the experiments can resolve the two photons .",
    "the cms detector has a `` preshower '' in the ecal that has the strong capability to resolve the two photons of the neutral pion decay as it is the most important background for the intermediate mass higgs boson search .",
    "we can make use of this preshower in the ecal to resolve the two photons of the @xmath12 decay .",
    "we will then show the cross section for the associated production after imposing the preshower requirements .",
    "once we resolve the two photons in the decay of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , we can differentiate the nmssm from the mssm .",
    "the organization is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the particular region of parameter space in which the light pseudoscalar higgs boson decouples and decays into a pair of photons . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the decay branching ratios of the @xmath12 .",
    "we then calculate the associated production of the light pseudoscalar higgs boson with a chargino pair in the zero - mixing limit at the lhc and ilc in sec .",
    "we also work out the distribution of the opening angle of the photon pair .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm consists of the usual two higgs doublets @xmath19 and @xmath20 and an extra higgs singlet @xmath9 .",
    "the extra singlet field is allowed to couple only to the higgs doublets of the model , the supersymmetrization of which is that the singlet field only couples to the higgsino doublets . consequently , the couplings of the singlet @xmath9 to gauge bosons and fermions will only be manifest via their mixing with the doublet higgs fields .",
    "after the higgs fields take on the vev s and rotating away the goldstone modes , we are left with a pair charged higgs bosons , 3 real scalar fields , and 2 pseudoscalar fields . in particular , the mass matrix for the two pseudoscalar higgs bosons @xmath21 and @xmath22 is @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath21 is the one in mssm while @xmath22 comes from the singlet @xmath9 and from the effects of rotating away the goldstone modes .",
    "the pseudoscalar fields are further rotated to the diagonal basis ( @xmath12 , @xmath29 ) through a mixing angle @xcite : @xmath30 where the masses of @xmath31 are arranged such that @xmath32 . at tree - level the mixing angle is given by @xmath33 in the approximation of large @xmath15 and large @xmath34 , which is normally valid in the usual mssm , the tree - level cp - odd masses can be written as @xcite @xmath35 we are interested in the case that @xmath12 is very light . from eq .",
    "( [ small - ma ] ) it can be seen that @xmath36 can be very small if either @xmath37 or @xmath38 is very small , which is made possible by a pecci - quinn ( pq ) symmetry : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we can achieve a small mixing angle by the cancellation between the two terms in the numerator of eq.([tana ] ) , by setting @xmath41 explicitly , here we give a sample point in the parameter space : @xmath42 then it can give @xmath43    we have the following parameters in the nmssm in addition to those of the mssm : @xmath44 , @xmath37 , @xmath45 , @xmath38 , and @xmath8 ( @xmath46 has been eliminated by one of the tadpole equations in the electroweak symmetry breaking . ) since @xmath47 , we can use @xmath4 and @xmath44 in place of @xmath8 . also from eqs .",
    "( [ ma ] ) , ( [ small - ma ] ) and ( [ tana ] ) we can trade @xmath37 , @xmath45 , and @xmath38 for @xmath48 , @xmath36 and @xmath49 .",
    "the small @xmath36 can be achieved by requiring @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ small - ma ] ) while keeping @xmath8 and @xmath38 typical .",
    "the small mixing angle , on the other hand , is achieved by the condition in eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) such that the fine - tuned cancellation is possible to give a small value of @xmath50 .",
    "we admit that this is a fine tuning requirement .",
    "recall in the cp violating supersymmetry a natural mechanism to suppress the contributions from various sources of cp violating phases is to have a cancellation among various sources @xcite .",
    "if the measurement of edm continues to push to more stringent limits , more and more fine - tuned cancellations are needed to suppress the susy contributions .",
    "a lot of existing constraints on the lightest pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath12 depend on the mixing angle @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath49 goes to zero , the @xmath12 decouples and behaves like the singlet .",
    "this light @xmath12 can be extremely light without violating any existing data .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that it can be produced in the scalar higgs boson decay , @xmath51 , which is due to the term @xmath52 in the superpotential .",
    "we found in this work that there is another novel signature for this light @xmath12 from the same term . we calculate the associated production of @xmath12 with a pair of charginos , followed by @xmath53 decay at hadronic and @xmath54 colliders .",
    "this is an undebatable signal of the decoupling regime of the nmssm .    in the limit of zero mixing",
    ", the @xmath12 only couples to a pair of charginos and neutralinos .",
    "therefore , the dominant decay mode is @xmath55 via a chargino loop if @xmath36 is very light .",
    "when we turn on the small mixing angle , other modes , such as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , appear , which will eventually dominate when the mixing angle is larger than @xmath59 . we show a typical decay branching ratio versus the mixing angle for @xmath60 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . when @xmath36 is as light as 0.1 gev , only the @xmath54 and @xmath55 modes are possible .",
    "the @xmath54 mode scales as @xmath61 , and so the @xmath54 mode increases sharply as @xmath49 increases in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . as @xmath36 increases other @xmath62 modes open up , such as @xmath63 .",
    "as long as @xmath64 the @xmath55 dominates the decay of @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling of @xmath31 to charginos comes from the usual higgs - higgsino - gaugino source and , specific to nmssm , from the term @xmath65 in the superpotential .",

    "so is the gluon fusion since only quarks can mediate inside the loops .",
    "the associated production of @xmath12 with a chargino pair proceeds via the feynman diagrams , in which the @xmath12 radiates off the chargino legs .",
    "the radiation off the intermediate @xmath77 is not considered in the very small mixing limit .",
    "note that the production is proportional to @xmath78 , which implies a large higgsino component in @xmath79 is necessary for large cross sections .",
    "details of the calculation will be given in a future publication .",
    "we choose @xmath73 gev and a much larger @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 , which should be of the order of @xmath82 .",
    "the size is limited by the perturbativity argument when the yukawa coupling is evolved to the gut scale .",
    "we have followed the prescription from other papers . in general",
    ", the perturbativity argument is rather loose .",
    "there may be some other new physics that appear well below the gut scale .",
    "but roughly @xmath83 is the upper limit applied to @xmath44 for the perturbativity reason . ] and @xmath84 in our results .",
    "we show the production cross sections at @xmath54 colliders versus @xmath36 for @xmath85 tev in fig .",
    "note that the cross section is insensitive to @xmath49 as long as it is less than @xmath86 .",
    "also , in this near - zero mixing region , the cross section scales as @xmath87 . with @xmath88 fb@xmath89 yearly luminosity at the ilc ,",
    "the number of raw events is of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "the signature is very spectacular with a pair of charged leptons and a pair of photons with a large missing energy .",
    "in contrast to the process of @xmath90 @xcite , the photon pair is less collimated because the @xmath12 radiating off the chargino would not be as energetic as the @xmath12 from higgs decay .",
    "almost all sm backgrounds are reducible once the photon pair and the charged lepton pair are identified together with large missing energies .",
    "the leptonic branching ratio of the chargino can increase if the slepton or sneutrino mass is relatively light .",
    "one can also increase the detection rates by including the hadronic decay of the charginos .",

    "it remains possible to detect the pseudoscalar higgs boson and chargino decays .",
    "experiments can search for the same final states that we listed for the ilc .",
    "almost all sm backgrounds are reducible if the photon pair can be resolved and measured , together with the charged leptons or jets plus missing energies .",
    "the critical issue here is whether the lhc experiment can resolve the two photons in the decay of the pseudoscalar higgs boson .",
    "we perform a monte carlo study for the production of @xmath96 followed by the decay of @xmath97 . since @xmath12 is a pseudoscalar , it is sufficient to study the @xmath98 phase - space decay of @xmath12 .",
    "we impose transverse momentum and rapidity requirements on the photons : @xmath99 which are in accord with the ecal of the cms detector @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the `` preshower '' detector quoted in the report is as good as @xmath100 mrad .",

    "the final issue is the background suppression .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ angle ] that for @xmath113 gev , almost all cross section lies below @xmath103 , which is our conservative choice of resolution according to the preshower detector of the cms .",

    "one may ask if a very light pseudoscalar higgs boson is consistent with the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath122 ) because it can contribute substantially to @xmath122 at both 1-loop and 2-loop levels .",
    "however , it was shown that the 2-loop barr - zee type contributions with a light pseudoscalar can be of comparable size as the 1-loop contributions and opposite in sign @xcite .",
    "note that the contributions of the light @xmath12 of the nmssm go to zero as @xmath123 . in the nmssm",
    ", there could also be a light neutralino @xcite that can contribute to @xmath122 .",
    "in addition , there are many parameters in the mssm , such as gaugino and sfermion masses , which the @xmath122 depends on .",
    "thus , one can carefully take into account both 1- and 2-loop contributions and by adjusting the nmssm parameters , such that the @xmath122 constraint is satisfied .",
    "there are other constraints on a light pseudoscalar from rare @xmath124 and @xmath125 meson decays , such as @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 mixing , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 @xcite .",

    "thus , in the limit of zero - mixing the constraints on the light @xmath12 can be easily evaded .",
    "the major difference between mssm and nmssm is the existence of a singlet field , which gives rise to a scalar , a pseudoscalar , and a neutralino , in addition to the particle contents of the mssm .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to have a very light pseudoscalar with a tiny mixing with the mssm pseudoscalar .",
