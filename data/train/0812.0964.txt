    "the main components of our universe are ` dark ' .",
    "many astrophysical observations have confirmed the existence of dark matter ( dm ) which contributes roughly @xmath4 to the energy density of the universe .",
    "if the dm are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , they would annihilate into gamma rays , neutrinos and anti - matter particles , which could be detected experimentally .",
    "generally speaking , the dm should be stable compared with the life of the universe .",
    "however it is possible that the dm is decaying at an extremely low rate .",
    "similarly , the dm decay products can be observable .",
    "recently pamela released their first cosmic rays results on the positron and anti - proton ratios @xcite .",
    "usually the anti - matter particles are expected to be produced when the cosmic rays propagate in the galaxy and interact with the interstellar medium .",
    "the pamela data show a clear upturn ( excess ) on the positron ratio above @xmath5 gev up to @xmath6 gev .",
    "besides pamela observation , atic collaboration also reported an electron / positron excess around @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "contrary to the excess of position ratio , pamema anti - proton ratio is consistent with the predictions .",
    "both pamela and atic observations indicate some unknown high energy primary positron sources in the galaxy .",
    "studies showed that the pulsars or other nearby astrophysical sources may account for the pamela results @xcite .    other possibility to induce",
    "the positron excess can be the annihilating @xcite or decaying @xcite dm in the galaxy . in the annihilating dm scenario , if the cross section @xmath8 is taken as the typical annihilation cross section @xmath9 for thermal relic , a large extra boost factor ( bf ) is needed to produce sufficient positron flux to fit the pamela results .",
    "many ideas are proposed to induce the large bf .",
    "for example , the new ` long ' range force would enhance the annihilation cross section for today low velocity dm , which is dubbed as ` sommerfeld effect ' @xcite .",
    "for the decaying dm scenario , by adjusting the lifetime of the dm , no bf is needed .",
    "contrary to positron excess , no obvious anti - proton excess has been observed .",
    "this suggests that the main final products from the annihilation or decay of dm are charge leptons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) for @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise one needs much heavy dm , say @xmath11 @xcite , or some special cosmic - ray propagation parameters .",
    "provided that charged leptons are generated by dm annihilating and/or decaying dm , it is quite interesting to investigate which charged leptons are response for the pamela and atic observations .",
    "it is natural to expect that the high energy charged leptons are correlated to other observable signals , such as gamma rays , synchrotron emissions or neutrinos .",
    "detecting neutrino signals from dm is very attractive and useful to pin down the nature of dm . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the neutrino flux from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are producing by dm . unlike other dm related products , neutrinos have less trajectory defection and less but finite energy loss @xcite during propagation , due to their weakly interaction nature . as a result",
    ", the neutrinos can keep the important information of the dm . for the same reason , the neutrinos are difficult to be detected if the flux is low ( for some recent works , see @xcite ) .",
    "usually the neutrinos detected by neutrino telescopes , such as super - kamiokande @xcite , amanda @xcite etc .",
    "are expected to be the atmospheric neutrinos , which are produced by interaction between the cosmic rays and atmosphere .",
    "the atmospheric neutrinos are the main backgrounds for detecting the extra neutrinos from dm .",
    "currently , no high energy astrophysical neutrinos have ever been detected @xcite .",
    "if the charged leptons are indeed produced by dm , it is a good news for neutrino detection .",
    "firstly , the neutrino flux can be much larger than that of usual expected .",
    "the pamela and atic data need higher primary positron production rate than usual production , thus it is natural to expect that large neutrino flux can be produced from @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays .",
    "secondly , the heavy dm ( e.g. @xmath12 ) is favored by atic result , thus the neutrinos at the similar energy scale are expected . as the main backgrounds , the atmospheric neutrino flux decreases logarithmically with the increment of energy , thus higher energy neutrinos correspond to less backgrounds .",
    "on - going and future kilometer size neutrino telescopes such as antares @xcite , icecube @xcite and km3net @xcite can better explore these signals .",
    "thirdly , in the annihilating dm scenario , the flux of neutrinos depends on the square of the dm number density .",
    "if one searches the galactic center ( gc ) or large dm subhalos which contain the denser dm than other areas , large neutrino flux can be produced .",
    "moreover if the sommerfeld effect of dm annihilation is true , the dm annihilation in the subhalo can acquire even larger bf due to the lower velocity dispersion than that in the dm halo @xcite .",
    "as a side remark , this feature provides a potential method to distinguish two dm scenarios , namely gc or dm subhalos can be higher flux neutrino sources in the annihilating dm scenario than those in the decaying dm one .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in section",
    "ii , we calculated the neutrino flux from the gc and dm subhalo , in the model - independent manner , in the annihilating and decaying dm scenarios . in section iii , we estimated the muon rate at antares and icecube for the two dm scenarios .",
    "we pointed out that antares and icecube might detect neutrino signals in annihilating dm scenario and distinguish different dm scenarios .",
    "section iv contains our discussions and conclusions .",
    "pamela data show an excess on positron fraction about @xmath13 times larger than usual estimation , so it is natural to expect that the neutrinos from dm are also enhanced by the similar number . in the annihilating dm scenario ,",
    "it is achieved by sommerfeld enhancement and/or clumps in dm density . in this paper ,",
    "bf is used to denote the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "astrophysical enhancement is contained in the astrophysical factor , as described below .",
    "the neutrino flux observed on the earth can be written as @xmath14 and @xmath15 with dimensionless @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 @xmath19 here a and d denote annihilating and decaying dm respectively .",

    "after vacuum oscillation , we adopt assumption that the three flavor neutrinos have the equal flux @xcite .",
    "thus we multiply a factor of @xmath32 in order to get the flux of muon neutrino and anti - muon neutrino , which is the main measured component in the neutrino detector .",
    "we should mention here that the tau neutrinos can also be observed by the cherenkov neutrino detector because tau neutrino has the different signal compared with muon neutrino .",
    "the tau neutrino can interact with nucleons and produce tau leptons which subsequently decay into muons .",
    "thus they will produce a kink in the reconstruction by cherenkov light , while the muon neutrino has no such kink .",

    "@xcite have discussed the tau neutrino from decaying dark matter and found it can improve the detection by a few orders of magnitude .",
