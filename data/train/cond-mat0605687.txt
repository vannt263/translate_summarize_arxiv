    "the proposed spin - hall effect , namely , the appearance of a spin current along the direction perpendicular to the driving electric field , has attracted much recent theoretical and experimental attention . in early studies , it was shown that an _ extrinsic _ spin - hall effect may arise from a spin - orbit ( so ) interaction of electrons induced by electron - impurity scattering potential.@xcite recently , a scattering - independent _ intrinsic _ spin - hall effect , which entirely originates from a spin - orbit coupling in the free - carrier system itself , has been predicted respectively in @xmath1-type bulk semiconductors@xcite and @xmath2-type two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with rashba@xcite and dresselhaus so interaction.@xcite the experimental observations of the spin - hall effect have been also reported in a @xmath2-type bulk semiconductor@xcite and in a two - dimensional heavy - hole system.@xcite    in two - dimensional electron systems with rashba so interaction , ignoring the effect of disorders , sinova _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the spin - hall conductivity , @xmath3 , has a universal intrinsic value @xmath0 at zero temperature.@xcite subsequently , a great deal of research work was focused on the influence of disorders on this intrinsic spin - hall effect . when rashba two - dimensional electron systems are sufficiently dirty and the anderson localization is dominant , sheng _",
    "_ found that the spin - hall conductivity can be much greater or smaller than the universal value @xmath0.@xcite in the diffusive regime , it was demonstrated that the collisional broadening in the density of states of electrons leads to a reduction of the spin - hall current and the @xmath0 value of @xmath3 can be reached only for relatively weak electron - impurity scattering.@xcite however , further investigation revealed that the electron - impurity scattering can also produce an additional contribution to spin - hall current , which is independent of the impurity density and has a sign opposite to the original one . as a result",
    ", the total spin - hall current is completely suppressed for a short - range electron - impurity scattering potential.@xcite this conclusion has been confirmed by different methods , such as kubo formula,@xcite keldysh formalism,@xcite and spin - density method@xcite _ etc_. also , it made clear that this cancellation of spin - hall current is not due to any symmetry.@xcite    however , in most previous studies , the vanishing of the spin - hall current was found only for a short - range electron - impurity scattering.@xcite it is well known that , in realistic 2d semiconductor systems , the dominant electron - impurity collisions are long - ranged .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the spin - hall current survives in the case of long - range electron - impurity scattering . in ref .",
    ", the authors argued that the total spin - hall current should be _ nonvanishing _ in the case of long - range electron - impurity collisions .",
    "however , raimondi and schwab again got a vanishing spin - hall conductivity considering a weakly momentum - dependent potential : this potential depends on the cosine of the angle between the initial and the final momenta , but is independent of their magnitudes.@xcite    in this paper , we carefully investigate the spin - hall current in 2d electron systems with rashba so coupling by means of a nonequilibrium green s function approach .",
    "we consider a quite general form of the electron - impurity scattering potential : it depends not only on the directions but also on the magnitudes of the electron momenta .",
    "such a potential can be used to describe the realistic coulomb interaction between electrons and impurities in 2d semiconductors .",
    "besides , in contrast to all of the previous discussions concerning electron behaviors in the spin basis,@xcite our formalism is presented in the helicity basis .",
    "such a treatment allows us to interpret the origin of the spin - hall effect in terms of interband polarization processes .",
    "we clarify that the spin - hall current arises from two mechanisms : disorder - unrelated and disorder - mediated mechanisms , which correspond to two distinct helicity - basis interband polarizations .",
    "the disorder - unrelated mechanism is associated with a polarization directly induced by dc electric field , which results in the original intrinsic spin - hall current with contribution from all electron states in the fermi sea .",
    "the disorder - mediated mechanism relates to a polarization mediated by electron - impurity scattering and is associated mainly with the electron states in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "we find that in infinitely large 2d rashba semiconductors , the total spin - hall current vanishes , independently of the specific form of the electron - impurity scattering potential , of the impurity density , of the so coupling constant , and of temperature",
    ".    however , we also make clear that the `` always vanishing '' of the spin - hall current occurs only for _ infinitely large _ samples .",
    "care must be taken in regard with this conclusion when the sample size reduces .",
    "the discretization of the energy levels in finite - size system may lead to a nonvanishing total spin - hall current in _",
    "rashba 2d semiconductors even in the quasiclassical regime .",
    "numerical calculation for square shape rashba 2d electron systems of size in micrometer regime , indicates that depending on the system size , the total spin - hall conductivity can be positive , zero or negative , with a maximum absolute value reaching up to the order of magnitude of @xmath0 at low temperatures . as a function of the sample size , @xmath3 oscillates around zero with a decreasing amplitude when increasing sample size .",
    "such a size effect can be observable only at low temperatures .",
    "when temperature increases that @xmath4 becomes comparable with the finite - size induced energy separation of the electron states at the fermi surface , @xmath3 oscillation disappears and the spin - hall conductivity returns to a small nonvanishing value before it slowly approaches zero with further increasing sample size .",

    "for it to appear , one has to accurately control the shape and size of the sample . in addition , the mobility of the sample should be high and the temperature should be low that both the collisional broadening of the electron energy level and the temperature smearing are smaller than the finite - size induced energy separation of the electron states around the fermi surface .",

    "<S> a nonequilibrium green s function approach is employed to investigate the spin - hall effect in diffusive two - dimensional electron systems with rashba spin - orbit interaction . considering a long - range electron - impurity scattering potential in the self - consistent born approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the spin - hall effect arises from two distinct interband polarizations in helicity basis : a disorder - unrelated polarization directly induced by the electric field and a polarization mediated by electron - impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder - unrelated polarization is associated with all electron states below the fermi surface and produces the original intrinsic spin - hall current , while the disorder - mediated polarization emerges with contribution from the electron states near the fermi surface and gives rise to an additional contribution to the spin - hall current . within the diffusive regime , </S>",
    "<S> the total spin - hall conductivity vanishes in _ infinitely large _ samples , independently of temperature , of the spin - orbit coupling constant , of the impurity density , and of the specific form of the electron - impurity scattering potential </S>",
    "<S> . however , in a _ finite - size _ rashba two - dimensional semiconductor , the spin - hall conductivity no longer always vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the sample size in the micrometer range , it can be positive , zero or negative with a maximum absolute value reaching as large as @xmath0 order of magnitude at low temperatures . as the sample size increases , the total spin - hall conductivity oscillates with a decreasing amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the temperature dependence of the spin - hall conductivity for different sample sizes . </S>"
