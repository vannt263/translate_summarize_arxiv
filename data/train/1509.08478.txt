    "entanglement entropy is a powerful tool for characterizing the entanglement structure of quantum states .",
    "it is a quantity of interest in high energy physics , condensed matter , and quantum information theory alike . despite its relevance ,",
    "the definition of entanglement entropy in gauge theories has not been understood in depth until rather recently .",
    "the ubiquitous difficulty lay in the fact that gauge invariance introduced a degree of nonlocality at the uv scale that seemed to make it impossible to define subsystems whose entanglement entropy we were to measure . a number of approaches have been proposed to address this issue @xcite ; in subsequent sections we will review them and see how they all revolve around constructing a gauge - invariant density operator whose von neumann entropy can be interpreted as the entanglement entropy of the given subsystem .",
    "this paper will take the route very close to the one outlined in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to use these technical developments to further our understanding of the ground state entanglement in weakly coupled yang - mills theories . working within a lattice gauge theory framework",
    ", we provide a comprehensive description of the calculation of entanglement entropy for yang - mills theories on arbitrary lattices and for arbitrary gauge groups @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the presence of a ubiquitous term that , in a continuum with @xmath4 spatial dimensions , takes the form here @xmath2 is the linear size of the entanglement region and @xmath1 is the continuum gauge coupling , and for @xmath5 the logarithm is replaced just by @xmath6 .",
    "this term is of particular importance in @xmath7 , where it is the dominant universal term of the entanglement entropy that takes the form    we obtain the advertised results by gauge - fixing to axial gauge , expressing the gauge theory as a principal chiral model with spontaneous symmetry breaking , and calculating the entanglement entropy of the resulting nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "model of scalar matter assumes that the constant mode is frozen into a particular position on the sphere @xmath8 .",
    "however , one can also construct the state that features `` restoration of symmetry '' by uniformly superposing all possible directions that the constant mode can point in .",
    "this construction effectively `` gauges away '' the zero mode of the theory , and it is this kind of state that we will encounter when gauge - fixing the yang - mills theory . in general , whenever we refer to `` spontaneous symmetry breaking '' in this paper , we will refer to a projection to just the sector of nambu - goldstone bosons , where the wavefunction does not depend on the zero mode .",
    "] the key ingredient here is the fact that nambu - goldstone bosons do not have a zero mode and therefore exhibit enhanced entanglement of the softest mode in the entanglement region @xcite .",
    "thus , we can qualitatively say that the @xmath9 term arises because weakly coupled gauge theories look like @xmath10 decoupled photons , with each photon behaving like a scalar field with a zero mode removed ( or gauged away ) .",
    "for the special case of the @xmath7 maxwell theory , this logarithmic term has been computed in an alternative way , by dualizing to a compact scalar theory ( the @xmath11 model ) that exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper touch on many other studies of entanglement in gauge theories .",
    "our computation shows that the @xmath9 term is at least one part of entanglement entropy that is invariant under field - theoretic dualities .",
    "further , the weak - coupling entanglement entropy is explicitly shown to scale as @xmath12 in the planar limit , forming a contrast to the vanishing of the entropy at strong lattice coupling and suggesting , along the lines of @xcite , that entanglement entropy is indeed a good order parameter for confinement that can be explicitly computed in both weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "finally , we draw a connection between the logarithmic terms above and the topological entanglement entropy in @xmath7 @xcite , arguing that @xmath9 is the analog of this important quantity for systems with continuous gauge groups .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec notation ] , we give a short but self - contained introduction to lattice gauge theories and set the notation to be used throughout the paper . in section [ sec prelim ] , we give a very explicit definition of entanglement entropy in a gauge theory @xcite , and we show how it agrees with other definitions in the literature . an example is given in section [ sec strong ] , where the strong coupling entanglement entropy at large @xmath13 is computed for the first time .",
    "the main calculation is given in section [ sec weak ] and it culminates with the above result for @xmath9 and with a reasonable conjecture for the general form of the total gauge theory entropy .",
    "further implications of our results are discussed in the conclusion , and miscellaneous technical points are collected in the appendices .",
    "our hamiltonian formulation of non - abelian lattice gauge theory in @xmath4 spatial dimensions is based on the seminal work of kogut and susskind @xcite .",
    "the notation follows the approaches of @xcite .",
    "we work on a finite lattice with open boundary conditions and no nontrivial topology .",
    "the lattice sites are labeled by @xmath14 , and the links are labeled either by a link index , @xmath15 , by a pair of adjacent site indices , @xmath16 , or by a site and a direction , @xmath17 .",
    "each link is oriented , so if @xmath18 , the link of opposite orientation is @xmath19 . in all examples",

    "given a quantum state labeled by @xmath41 , the electric operators act on it as covariant derivatives on the lie manifold with coordinates @xmath42 : the covariant laplacian @xmath43 is a casimir invariant that we will use extensively .",
    "the sum @xmath44 is the `` electric term '' in the kogut - susskind hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the remaining , `` magnetic term '' of this hamiltonian is given by the * magnetic operators * @xmath45 and @xmath46 , defined on lattice plaquettes @xmath40 as where @xmath2 is a representation of the gauge group and the links in the product @xmath47 are traversed counterclockwise .    henceforth , when @xmath2 is dropped , the fundamental representation is understood .",
    "we will always use @xmath13 to denote the dimension of this representation . using these conventions",
    ", the full kogut - susskind hamiltonian is where @xmath48 is the gauge coupling .",
    "we will exclusively work with this hamiltonian in this paper , though our results would not qualitatively change if we included more terms in the magnetic potential .",
    "gauge - invariant systems are insensitive to all local transformations of the form where @xmath49 assigns an element of @xmath0 to each lattice site .",
    "such transformations are implemented in terms of operators via where we have introduced the * gauss operators * @xmath50 at each site . in the above product",
    "there are exactly two momentum operators acting on each link , one acting in the direction of the link and one in the opposite direction .",
    "together they implement the desired local transformation . gauging this transformation",
    ", we demand that physical states are only those satisfying @xmath51 or , equivalently , @xmath52 at each site and for any @xmath25 .",
    "the space of all such states is the physical hilbert space @xmath53 .    in the first half of the paper",
    "we will work in the * electric basis * of @xmath22 and @xmath53 .",
    "this basis diagonalizes the electric term @xmath54 on each link .",

    "we review the systematics of these electric eigenstates .",
    "an excellent reference with many more details is @xcite .",
    "elements of the electric basis of @xmath22 can be thought of as products over links of wavefunctions on the space of representations of @xmath0 . on a given link , an electric basis element labeled by an irreducible representation",
    "@xmath2 is where @xmath62 is the dimension of @xmath2 .",
    "the normalization @xmath63{\\qprod{r}{r'}}{_\\ell } = \\delta_{rr'}\\ , r(\\1)$ ] follows from eq .   and the weyl orthogonality property as an example ,",
    "the fundamental and antifundamental representations @xmath64 are with @xmath65 .    given a ( possibly self - intersecting or multiply - winding ) closed loop of links @xmath66 , the physical states on @xmath67 are where @xmath68 if the link @xmath69 is traversed in the direction of its orientation , and @xmath70 if not .",
    "these states form the electric basis of @xmath53 ; they are eigenstates of the electric term of with eigenvalues @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath2 of the gauge algebra .",
    "for example , we have @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 . at large @xmath13 ,",
    "states defined on different loops are all orthogonal to each other , and hence electric basis elements in the planar limit are indexed by the set of all closed loops with a representation associated to each loop .",
    "entanglement entropy quantifies how much information is lost by restricting ourselves to a part of the given system .",
    "the point of view of this paper is that , given a state of the whole system , one can always construct a reduced density operator that precisely reproduces the physics ( i.e.  all the correlation functions ) of the original state in just a part of the full system .",
    "the entanglement entropy is then the von neumann entropy associated to this operator ; roughly speaking , this measures the number of states a subsystem can be in while the entire system is in a given state .",
    "this is the quantity we will compute .",
    "there exist alternative ( possibly inequivalent ) approaches to entanglement entropy , e.g.  axiomatic definitions involving strong subadditivity , but we will not address them here .    the definition of a reduced density operator in gauge theories is tricky because the physical hilbert space @xmath53 does not admit a decomposition into a direct product of hilbert spaces defined solely on a region @xmath77 and its complement @xmath78 .",
    "there are several ways to address this subtlety :    * embedding @xmath53 into a direct product of hilbert spaces defined separately on @xmath77 and @xmath78 gives rise to a density operator that can be reduced in the usual way @xcite .",
    "* elements of the reduced density matrix may be computable via a euclidean path integral by directly path - integrating and using the replica trick ( see e.g.  @xcite for some salient examples ) . * in theories that admit holographic duals ,",
    "entanglement entropy can be computed following the ryu - takayanagi prescription @xcite ( see @xcite for an explanation on why this is equivalent to the computation via the replica method in the boundary theory ) . * in special circumstances , the gauge theory setup can be mapped to a problem in which the reduced density operator / entanglement entropy calculation is tractable @xcite .",
    "these approaches might not yield the most general method for computing a reduced density matrix , but they are important for checking any general prescription . * finally , a reduced density operator can be defined purely algebraically , as the unique density operator in any subalgebra of observables that reproduces the expectation values of all the operators in the subalgebra @xcite .",
    "these methods are equivalent in a precise sense that we will discuss below .",
    "we will start from the particularly transparent approach taken in the progression of papers @xcite , where the last of the above prescriptions was followed .",
    "given the algebra @xmath79 of all gauge - invariant operators on a set of links ( not sites or plaquettes ) @xmath77 , it is _ always _ possible to find the density operator @xmath80 and calculate its von neumann entropy .",
    "this prescription is manifestly gauge - invariant and associates an entropy to all the physical data contained in a region of space .",
    "varying what algebra one assigns to a region ( e.g.  dropping magnetic operators near the edges of the set @xmath77 ) leads to different values for the entanglement entropy @xcite ; the results of @xcite suggest that these alternative entropies correspond to entanglement regions with operator insertions on the entangling edge , and we will have more to say about this at the end of this section .      the desired reduced density operator is constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath78 be a set of links and its complement , and let @xmath81 be the set of sites for which some ( but not all ) emanating links are in @xmath77 .",
    "for each @xmath82 , define * boundary electric operators * as gauss operators at boundary sites @xmath38 can be expressed as where , as in , the @xmath83 s are defined such that @xmath84 .",
    "the gauge constraint requires @xmath85 for all @xmath86 , and hence it must be true that when acting on any physical state .",
    "of course , these operators are not gauge - invariant , but e.g.  the quadratic casimirs @xmath87 are , and the above relation implies that all possible boundary casimirs  not just the quadratic ones  generate the center of the algebra @xmath79 .",
    "the center elements are all diagonalized simultaneously in the electric basis .",
    "the physical space @xmath53 thus naturally splits into superselection sectors @xmath88 labeled by @xmath89 , the collection of casimir eigenvalues at various sites @xmath38 , where @xmath90 is the total number of boundary casimirs .",

    ", wilson loops along    noncontractible cycles would need to be added manually to the set of    usual plaquette excitations on flat space , whereas in the projection    language the holonomies are automatically included from the start .",
    "the    dichotomy between the two views of gauge theory seems intimately    related to the old question of compact versus noncompact gauge groups :    choosing a noncompact gauge group matches the gaussian fluctuations in    the compact theory but misses the topological / nonperturbative effects    such as vortices and monopoles , and as a result it typically yields a    nonunitary quantum theory unless these defects are added to the theory    by fiat .",
    "even after the above choices are made , we are still left with a variety of methods to calculate the entanglement entropy , as enumerated in subsection [ subsec overview ] .",
    "we will now comment on the equivalence of these approaches .",
    "the discussion of gauge - invariant entanglement of gauge - variant degrees of freedom around eq .   serves to justify the `` embedding approach '' to defining a reduced density operator @xcite .",
    "if we embed the physical hilbert space into a space where matter degrees of freedom can live on the entanglement edge  effectively splitting the links into two , as done in @xcite  we can directly construct the appropriate density operator @xmath127 by the usual tracing out procedure .",
    "as long as the initial state is gauge - invariant , @xmath127 will entangle these edge degrees of freedom so that it computes the correct expectations of gauge - invariant operators in @xmath79 while giving zero for gauge - variant operators .",
    "( in fact , the spaces @xmath128 can be viewed as subsets of such a larger hilbert space . ) extending this thought , instead of ever working with the physical space @xmath53 , we can just work with @xmath22 from the outset and ask for the entropy of the algebra of gauge - invariant operators @xmath79 acting on @xmath22 ; the answer will be the same as for @xmath53 , and it is given by tracing out the elements of @xmath22 defined on @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this tracing out can be expressed by a lattice path integral over all the link configurations , and this connects the calculations in the previous subsection to the ones done by usual replica trick methods .",
    "this demonstrates the equivalence of all the methods that have been proposed for calculating entanglement entropy in gauge theories .",
    "we can also connect these lattice computations to the ones done in the continuum limit .",
    "consider a set of links @xmath77 and focus on a particular site @xmath82 . to simplify ,",
    "pick @xmath38 so that there is only one link emanating from it that is in @xmath78 .",
    "now consider adding this one link to @xmath77 , thereby creating a new set @xmath129 .",
    "as long as adding this link has not introduced an entire new plaquette into @xmath77 , the gauss law guarantees the equality of algebras , @xmath130 , and of the associated entropies @xmath131 .",
    "thus , as the continuum limit is taken , the boundary of the entangling region is realized as a `` belt '' or `` buffer zone '' of thickness equal to the lattice spacing ; the entanglement entropy is not sensitive to whether the set of links @xmath77 is chosen to contain links in this belt or not .",
    "( for example , the link containing the @xmath132 operator on fig .",
    "[ fig def ] can be removed and the link containing the @xmath95 operator can be added to @xmath77 without affecting the entropy . )",
    "thus , there are equivalence classes of algebras that all have the same entropy , and this explains why it is sensible to draw the entangling edge as a line cutting through links  if removing a link keeps you in the same equivalence class , then it is meaningless to ask if that link is in @xmath77 or not , and the entanglement edge might as well be drawn as cutting the link for illustrative purposes .",
    "a reasonable conjecture , supported by the results of @xcite , is that each equivalence class corresponds to a different entangling edge in the continuum path integral , with classes differing by a single generator corresponding to continuum entanglement edges differing by a single operator insertion along the edge .",
    "we close this section by recalling that there are other choices for boundary conditions that label superselection sectors .",
    "( the detailed construction is given in @xcite , and here we just mention the basics . ) each choice corresponds to a commuting set of operators in the `` buffer zone '' of plaquettes around the entangling region , and the entanglement entropy does not depend on this choice .",
    "for instance , in @xmath7 , instead of specifying all the electric casimirs in fig .",

    "the nave ( and wrong / incomplete ) answer is simple : the electric part of the hamiltonian disappears and the ground state is an eigenstate of the position operators , defined in , such that @xmath301 on each plaquette . since our lattice is topologically trivial , the only axial gauge configuration that satisfies this has @xmath209 on all living links .",
    "this is the analog of the topological state @xmath302 found in @xmath303 gauge theories , e.g. the toric code in @xmath304 dimensions @xcite . in the electric basis",
    "this state becomes a sum over _ all _ representations on all living links , i.e. here @xmath305 denotes the product over all living links .",
    "this is a sum over infinitely many states , and this is reflected in the logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy due to the presence of infinitely many superselection sectors with equal probability .",
    "this divergence goes back to the bad behavior of the norm , @xmath306 , as expected for a state where each link has a definite position .",
    "this issue appears in the nave @xmath300 regime of any gauge theory with continuous gauge group , and as we will now show , it is an artifact of carelessly taking the weak coupling limit .    we must deal with this infinity in order to meaningfully talk about the weak coupling regime . to this end , we regulate the lie manifold of @xmath0 with a short - distance cutoff @xmath307 .",
    "this way the allowed values of @xmath122 are of the form @xmath308 with @xmath309 .",

    "these corrections will not be important for our purposes , as we will focus on excitations with @xmath312 ; these will be the ones relevant for describing the physics at very small coupling where the field configurations tend to be very close to @xmath163 .",
    ", when nonperturbative effects due to the nontrivial topology of the gauge group can be ignored .",
    "conversely , at @xmath313 one should be careful ; for instance , for @xmath7 and @xmath282 , monopole effects have a crucial effect on the physics via the polyakov mechanism @xcite . ] the effective hamiltonian acting on these basis states is found by expanding in @xmath307 : here we use @xmath314 to denote the discrete difference operator .",
    "the sums over links go over both living and dead links ; on each dead link we set @xmath315 and express @xmath316 through difference operators on living links . in this limit the colors decouple and we can write @xmath317 .",
    "this is the first indication that in the weak coupling regime the theory in a sense behaves as @xmath169 decoupled photons , which is of course the setup familiar from e.g.  weakly coupled qcd . because of this we might expect the entanglement entropy to scale with @xmath318 .    the crucial observation that allows us to understand the behavior of @xmath319 is that there exist two very different extremal regimes , @xmath320 and @xmath321 . the regime we are in depends on how @xmath307 and @xmath139 scale as they are both taken to zero .",
    "when @xmath321 , the @xmath322 term in the `` magnetic '' part of @xmath319 is very small , and nearby configurations @xmath323 and @xmath324 have infinitesimal energy differences . in other words , we may replace the states @xmath325 at fixed @xmath191 and @xmath15 with a continuous set @xmath326 with @xmath327 , so @xmath319 describes @xmath281 decoupled systems of harmonic oscillators ( noncompact photons ) , each with hamiltonian @xmath328 .",
    "this is the coulomb phase , and we will denote the corresponding ground state by @xmath168 .",
    "however , when @xmath320 , we can not so carelessly rescale the fields and get a nice description in terms of continuous oscillators . at finite @xmath329 , @xmath319 describes a collection of particles moving in a quadratic potential on a one - dimensional lattice , with @xmath329 being the spacing between the sites ; as this spacing is taken to infinity , the oscillators all freeze into @xmath315 .",
    "this frozen - out configuration is precisely the topological state @xmath302 .",
    "breaks the global @xmath0-symmetry of the physical states by picking @xmath209 .",
    "( this symmetry is explicitly broken by the boundary conditions at the edges of the lattice . ) calling this state topological is justified because the equal superposition of loops in @xmath302 makes the state invariant under arbitrary loop group transformations , which may in turn be viewed as diffeomorphisms on the underlying space .",

    "the intermediate ground state wavefunctions can be obtained in terms of mathieu functions @xcite .    in order to access the weak coupling regime of a theory with a continuous gauge group",
    ", we must take @xmath307 and @xmath139 small while keeping @xmath321 , and hence we _ can not _ navely set @xmath300 from the outset .",
    "if we are working with a discrete gauge group with @xmath330 elements , however , we are at liberty to take the coupling to zero with any ratio @xmath331 ; depending on this ratio the ground state interpolates between a topological state and the ground state of weakly coupled noncompact photons . for @xmath303 gauge theory this crossover ( or transition , depending on @xmath4 ) between the higgs and coulomb regimes is a classic result @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we review the salient properties of abelian gauge theories in @xmath7 .",
    "this section lies somewhat outside the main line of development of the paper , but we include it for completeness of presentation .      for most of this section we will focus on the @xmath133 theory in @xmath7 spatial dimensions .",
    "let us start from some continuum considerations ; a good review is @xcite .",
    "a general renormalizable lagrangian for the compact @xmath133 theory has a maxwell and a chern - simons ( cs ) term , where @xmath332 is the cs level and @xmath191 is the lattice spacing used to regulate the theory in the uv .",
    "in the continuum description we have @xmath333 , but the compactness is still recorded by the fact that the physics must be invariant under @xmath334 for @xmath335 .",
    "the single propagating degree of freedom in this theory has mass @xmath336 . at distances greater than @xmath337",
    "the theory behaves like pure cs at level @xmath338 , and below @xmath339 the theory behaves like the compact maxwell theory , whose propagators get nonperturbatively screened to zero at lengths @xmath340 @xcite .",
    "( typically one has @xmath341 , so this effect is invisible ; see @xcite for a more thorough discussion of monopole screening in the presence of cs terms . ) a related theory is the noncompact cs - maxwell , which has the same lagrangian @xmath342 as , except that @xmath338 , @xmath343 , and @xmath86 all take values in @xmath344 .",
    "physically , the only difference compared to the compact case is that now there is no nonperturbative screening of maxwell propagators , so at distances below @xmath339 the theory genuinely looks like just a free ( noncompact ) photon .",
    "this ubiquitous uv / ir structure has interesting consequences in light of the @xmath207-theorem , which states that the renormalized entanglement entropy @xmath345 of a circle of radius @xmath2 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath2 . let @xmath346 be this @xmath207-function for the cs - maxwell theory , compact or not .",
    "the continuum properties discussed above imply that for pure cs it is known that @xmath347 , so by monotonicity we have @xmath348 for any @xmath338 and any @xmath349 .",
    "this way one can justify finding a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy of small regions in the pure maxwell theory in the continuum and at any coupling . however , this conclusion is at odds with the entanglement entropy one could calculate for a maxwell theory on a lattice .",
    "a simple way out is to notice that the cs term is chiral while the maxwell one is not , and hence the rg flow of pure maxwell theory will never generate a cs term , and so the above analysis does not say anything about pure maxwell .",
    "however , we can run the above argument for two uncoupled cs - maxwell theories with opposite levels , or ( almost equivalently ) for two maxwell theories coupled with a bf term , and we still have the same conundrum ( and no parity arguments to save us ) .",
    "this tension is resolved in the following way . while the reviewed properties of continuum cs - maxwell theories are all correct , they are not the whole story .",
    "the information missing in is that @xmath350 holds _ at best _ only at @xmath351 .",
    "an easy way to see this is to keep @xmath1 fixed and increase @xmath338 until @xmath352 ; for any @xmath353 the presence of the cs level will be felt at all length scales and the theory will nowhere behave like pure maxwell .",
    "conversely , since cs - maxwell is a massive theory , it must be defined with a uv cutoff and this uv completion will always know about the cs level @xmath338 . in fact , at each @xmath338 there exists a distinct uv theory at the lattice scale ; the free maxwell theory is not a uv fixed point that controls the flow down to all cs - maxwell theories , and no cs term will ever be generated by flowing from the pure maxwell theory .",
    "thus the above @xmath207-theorem argument only ensures that far enough from both the deep uv and the deep ir  where the cs - maxwell theory looks like a pure maxwell theory  a term of the form @xmath354 appears in @xmath205 . in the deep ir , at @xmath285 ,",
    "this term becomes @xmath355 ( or zero , if there is no cs term ) , and in the deep uv , at @xmath356 , the log is replaced by a quantity proportional to @xmath357 , the logarithm of the bare coupling . in the main body of the paper we explicitly show that this is a correct prediction and that the entanglement entropy in the continuum maxwell theory indeed contains the expected , uv - independent logarithmic term",
    ".      we can support the above points by explicitly constructing a lattice theory whose continuum behavior is described by a cs - maxwell theory at given @xmath338 and @xmath1 .",
    "this construction is standard in condensed matter lore , where it is known that the @xmath358 cs theory at level @xmath338 with lagrangian describes the topological phase of the @xmath303 lattice gauge theory ( see e.g.  @xcite for @xmath359 incarnations of this idea ) .",
    "extending this idea , it can be shown that @xmath303 gauge theory at coupling @xmath139 and lattice spacing @xmath191 is a uv completion of such a @xmath358 cs - maxwell theory at level @xmath338 and coupling @xmath360 for both maxwell fields . ,",
    "so we will ignore these niceties .",
    "] we will spell out below how the ir behavior of @xmath303 coincides with the cs - maxwell theory , but we may already notice that the topological state @xmath302 of this lattice gauge theory has renormalized entanglement entropy @xmath361 , which is precisely ( and reassuringly ) the @xmath207-function of two cs theories at level @xmath338 .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath303 theory can be worked out by the machinery developed in the previous two sections .",
    "we set the lattice spacing to be @xmath362 . at any @xmath338 the theory confines at large enough @xmath139 . at @xmath363 ,",
    "the theory at short distances appears to be in the coulomb phase .",
    "however , in this limit @xmath303 begins to look like @xmath133 , so the polyakov mechanism gives the photons a very small mass gap and screens them at very long distances , meaning that the theory is actually confining .",
    "as @xmath329 is dialed away from zero and towards infinity , the coulomb phase crosses over to the topological phase . at high enough @xmath338 , the would - be - coulomb - but - actually - confined phase undergoes a deconfinement transition , has a very short transient behavior , and settles into the topological phase .",

    "( it would be interesting to work out exactly how @xmath329 translates to @xmath336 . ) finally , as the topological phase is reached at @xmath320 , all the fluctuations become infinitely gapped and we are left with the topological state described by the pure cs theory in the continuum .",
    "the maxwell theory on a lattice , being obtained by sending @xmath366 before taking any other limits of the @xmath303 theory , is thus not described by an effective cs theory even in the deep ir . in particular , the compact maxwell theory on a lattice will always be trivial in the ir due to the polyakov mechanism , and the noncompact maxwell theory on a lattice will be scale - invariant and will not rg flow .    even though the pure maxwell theory on a lattice does not have a topological phase , coupling it to other theories can allow it to flow to something topological in the ir . in particular , coupling maxwell theory to scalars of charge @xmath367 can higgs it and lead to a @xmath303 gauge theory @xcite . in the continuum language , this means that scalar qed@xmath368 can be written as a purely topological theory in the ir , which is a fact often used in studies of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "conversely , coupling a pure maxwell theory to a massive fermion will lead to just a @xmath133 cs theory , and indeed coupling any gauge theory to fermions is the right way to access the chiral cs regime , even for non - abelian groups @xcite .",

    "this is crucial : it means that the dual scalar theory is _ not _ a simple free field , but rather a `` truncated scalar '' ( a noncompact photon or a nambu - goldstone boson ) , i.e.  a scalar field in which configurations related by global shifts by @xmath139 have been identified .",
    "this `` gauging '' of the shift symmetry will lead to the promised appearance of log terms in the entanglement entropy .    in the continuum limit , the mapping ,",
    "must first be amended by replacing @xmath139 with @xmath377 .",

    "is increased , its softest mode will be allowed more and more leeway , leading to the presence of a monotonically increasing @xmath387 term in the entanglement entropy , as we will show explicitly below . as we work our way to higher length scales , only finite shifts will be gauged away and the logarithmic term will cross over to an @xmath388 constant by the time we reach the @xmath285 regime , where there are effectively no traces of the gauging left and the entanglement entropy corresponds to that of the noncompact , ordinary scalar . by further increasing @xmath271 we will eventually hit the confinement scale @xmath389 at which point the dual scalar becomes massive and the gauge fields become confined , and the entanglement entropy becomes zero .",
