    "gaugino condensation @xcite is arguably the most attractive mechanism for creating the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak ( ew ) scales @xcite-@xcite .",
    "starting with a perturbative gauge coupling at the planck or string scale , a new scale @xmath3 , at which the corresponding gauge group becomes strongly coupled , is created by dimensional transmutation .",
    "if these dynamics break supersymmetry , the ew scale can be generated as @xmath4 when supersymmetry breaking is communicated by gravity to the observable sector .",
    "this idea finds support in explicit string models which produce the ( exact ) spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "if gaugino condensation is indeed part of reality , it must be combined with inflation @xcite , which has by now gathered strong observational evidence .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of the gaugino condensate with the background of inflation or , more generally , in the presence of large positive vacuum energy .",
    "some facets of this problem have been considered before .",
    "gaugino condensation generates a potential for moduli , which is modified in the early universe during inflation and reheating . to ensure that moduli do not run away",
    ", certain constraints on the reheating temperature @xcite and the hubble parameter must be satisfied . in the latter case ,",
    "the situation is model dependent and only particular ( kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi - type @xcite ) scenarios with a specific choice of the inflaton have been studied @xcite . in the present work , we approach this problem from a more general perspective based on properties of the gaugino condensate itself and without specializing to a particular inflationary model or moduli stabilization mechanism .",
    "this allows us to obtain a ( largely ) model independent constraint on the hubble rate during inflation or any period of fast expansion .",
    "in the veneziano  yankielowicz approach @xcite , gaugino condensation is described in terms of the chiral superfield @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the gauge multiplet superfield which contains the gaugino as its lowest component .",
    "the low energy effective action for this field is derived using symmetries of the system and anomaly cancellation . in supergravity , the resulting khler potential @xmath7 and the superpotential @xmath8 are given by @xcite @xmath9 \\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\\\ & & w = { 1\\over 4}~ u \\bigl ( f s + { 2c\\over 3 } \\log ( \\xi u )    \\bigr ) + \\tilde w\\;. \\label{kw1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have taken the gauge kinetic function to be given by the dilaton @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the khler potential and the superpotential for other fields of the system apart from @xmath13 ; @xmath14 are constants of order one and @xmath15 is the beta function coefficient @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the quadratic casimir of the condensing gauge group @xmath18 .",
    "we will be studying the dynamics of the condensate in the region of physical interest @xmath19 in planck units . changing variables @xmath20 and expanding the result in powers of @xmath21 ,",
    "we get @xmath22 where , for simplicity , we have set @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the supergravity scalar potential for this system is given by @xmath26 here the subscript @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) denotes differentiation with respect to the @xmath29-th ( @xmath29-th complex conjugate ) scalar field ; @xmath18 is a function of the khler potential @xmath7 and superpotential @xmath8 : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the inverse of @xmath32 .    to understand the veneziano  yankielowicz result ,",
    "let us start with @xmath33 . at @xmath34 , the dominant contribution to the potential",
    "is given by @xmath35 the stationary points of this function are at @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the usual veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz solution corresponds to @xmath38 : @xmath39 which describes a supersymmetric vacuum with massive excitations .",
    "( more precisely , for an su@xmath40 group there are @xmath41 vacua which differ by a phase factor in @xmath21 ; this , however , is not important for our purposes . )",
    "the solution to @xmath37 is a local maximum at @xmath42 finally , @xmath43 formally corresponds to another supersymmetric chirally invariant vacuum , fig .",
    "[ destabplot ] .",
    "however , the veneziano  yankielowicz potential can not be trusted at @xmath44 .",
    "the existence of a supersymmetric chirally invariant vacuum is not allowed by general considerations @xcite and also inconsistent with the witten index theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of the state at @xmath43 remains controversial and it has been conjectured that it corresponds to a non - supersymmetric ( unstable ) state @xcite . in any case , the veneziano  yankielowicz potential is trustable around the susy minimum ( [ min ] ) and since the local maximum is close to it , @xmath45 , the existence of a potential barrier between the susy vacuum and some other state at @xmath46 is also expected to be reliable .    in the susy vacuum ( [ min ] ) , the gaugino condensate corresponds to a heavy field and can be integrated out .",
    "this creates an effective superpotential for the dilaton , which is a necessary ingredient for addressing the problem of dilaton / moduli stabilization .",
    "however , in the early universe this procedure is not always consistent : if the expansion rate of the universe is close to or greater than the gaugino condensation scale , the condensate remains a dynamical field whose evolution has to be taken into account . to address this issue ,",
    "in the next section we study the behavior of the condensate in the presence of large vacuum energy .",
    "consider the system of the dilaton , gaugino condensate and an extra field @xmath47 which generates large vacuum energy ( `` inflaton '' ) .",
    "this system can be described by eq.([kw1 ] ) , and consequently eq.([kw2 ] ) , with @xmath48 where @xmath49 . since @xmath34",

    "the @xmath53 contribution is an analog of the a  term , while the @xmath54 terms include the veneziano  yankielowicz potential @xmath55 and an extra contribution proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "note that the potential for the canonically normalized condensate is obtained by the rescaling @xmath57 .",
    "for a sufficiently large @xmath0 , the mass term will dominate and the condensate will quickly evolve to zero , @xmath58 .",
    "this is intuitively clear since the hubble expansion is analogous to `` heating up '' the condensate to temperature of order @xmath0 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . to determine the critical expansion rate",
    ", we need to find @xmath56 at which the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz minimum disappears .",
    "a sufficient condition for the absence of local extrema ( apart from @xmath43 ) is that the curvature of the potential in the @xmath59 direction be non - negative , @xmath60 we are interested in the case when the vacuum energy @xmath56 is dominated by the inflaton f - term , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , which corresponds to domination of the second term in ( [ v0 ] ) . then the @xmath53 contribution in eq.([v ] ) is ( up to a phase ) @xmath63 consider first the case @xmath64 .",
    "then the cubic term is suppressed by the loop factor @xmath15 .",
    "further , the @xmath54 term proportional to @xmath56 is small compared to the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz piece @xmath55 and can be neglected . as a result , the non - negative curvature condition amounts approximately to @xmath65 although this inequality can not be solved exactly , one can estimate the critical @xmath66 by requiring non - negative curvature at the local maximum of the veneziano  yankielowicz potential @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . for a canonically normalized @xmath69",
    ", we then have @xmath70 this agrees with our numerical results .",
    "note that the cubic term in ( [ v ] ) is at most @xmath71 , while the quadratic and the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz pieces around @xmath72 are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , such that for @xmath75 the quadratic term dominates .    for @xmath76 ,",
    "the cubic term is important and eq.([pos ] ) gives @xmath77    the potential for the gaugino condensate in the presence of positive vacuum energy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ destabplot ] .    ) , while the dotted ( red ) and the dashed ( blue ) curves correspond to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively.[destabplot ] ]",
    "we find that , unless @xmath76 , the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz minimum disappears at the hubble rate a loop factor below the gaugino condensation scale .",
    "this is natural as the features of the veneziano  yankielowicz potential are due to the loop  induced term @xmath80 and , consequently , the curvature of the potential at the maximum is loop  suppressed . in phenomenologically interesting cases , the condensing gauge group is of intermediate size , e.g. su(5 ) , such that @xmath81 and the critical hubble rate is about an order of magnitude below the gaugino condensation scale .",
    "this means that for @xmath82 the condensate will evolve to zero within a few hubble times .",
    "consequently , the dilaton superpotential approaches a constant and the dilaton potential attains a run ",
    "away form @xmath83 with the constant of order @xmath84 .",
    "the dilaton will thus quickly ( within a few hubble times ) evolve to weak coupling @xmath85 .",
    "needless to say , this scenario is phenomenologically unacceptable and the constraint @xmath78 must be satisfied .",
    "decreases , @xmath21 will settle in the `` wrong '' vacuum which is separated from the veneziano ",
    "yankielowicz minimum by a large potential barrier . ]",
    "this conclusion applies regardless of the specifics of the dilaton stabilization mechanism .",
    "indeed , the essential ingredient for dilaton stabilization is the superpotential due to gaugino condensation which becomes unavailable at @xmath86 .",
    "consider , for example , the khler stabilization scheme @xcite,@xcite with @xmath87 .",
    "the local minimum in @xmath10 is obtained due to cancellations between the khler corrections and the gaugino condensation superpotential . since the latter is not available as the gaugino condensate evaporates ,",
    "generically no local minima appear during inflation and the dilaton runs away .",
    "further , in the racetrack models @xcite,@xcite one sums over different condensates in eq.([kw1 ] ) : @xmath88 each one of them attains mass of order @xmath84 during inflation and is destabilized at the hubble rate greater than the largest @xmath89 ( in fact , a local minimum in @xmath10 disappears even if only some of the condensates evaporate ) .",
    "the potential becomes @xmath90 and the dilaton runs away .",
    "it is important to note that our result applies not only to inflation but more generally to any periods of fast expansion in the early universe .",
    "this is because the slow roll condition is not essential and the time scale for the evolution of @xmath21 and @xmath10 is given by a few hubble times .",
    "also , an extension to multiple inflatons @xmath91 is straightforward .",
    "finally , we have taken the gauge kinetic function to be given by the dilaton .",
    "this can readily be generalized to other cases , e.g. in kklt - type models @xcite one replaces @xmath92 with @xmath93 being the khler modulus , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the constant superpotential used to stabilize @xmath93 . to have low energy supersymmetry",
    ", this constant must be adjusted to be very small , @xmath97 . again , for large positive vacuum energy , the gaugino condensate acquires mass and quickly evolves to zero , which leads to disastrous consequences .",
    "this happens regardless of the details of the `` uplifting '' mechanism which adjusts the vacuum energy after inflation .",
    "let us now discuss our main assumptions . to establish evaporation of the gaugino condensate at high @xmath0 , we have relied ( 1 ) on the shape of the veneziano  yankielowicz potential around the susy minimum , which is quite reliable , and ( 2 ) on the khler potential of the form @xmath98 for small @xmath13 .",
    "the latter is in fact not necessary and our conclusion would hold more generally for khler potentials which can be brought to the canonical form by a change of variables @xmath99 with @xmath100 ( and non - singular scalar potential ) . in this case , the inflation  induced mass term is positive and the condensate evolves to zero .",
    "this fits the intuitive picture that the gaugino condensate vanishes at high de sitter temperature .",
    "we have also assumed that inflation is driven by the inflaton @xmath47 and the dilaton does not play any significant role in it .",
    "if this is not the case , @xmath101 , the @xmath53 term proportional to @xmath102 in eq.([v ] ) becomes important and can generate a local minimum at @xmath103 during inflation . then the gaugino condensate will evaporate only for @xmath104 . in this case",
    ", inflation does not amount to a background for the evolution of the condensate since there is significant superpotential interaction between the dilaton and the condensate .",
    "let us remark that realistic vacua with broken supersymmetry after inflation are possible due to the presence of extra fields in eq.[kw1 ] .",
    "in this case , the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite can be satisfied , for example , when susy breaking is dominated by matter  like fields @xcite .",
    "( alternatively , one can use non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential @xcite,@xcite . )",
    "once a dilaton stabilization mechanism is employed , the vy vacuum corresponds to a local minimum in the @xmath105 plane , so the usual procedure of integrating out the condensate is justified .",
    "the critical hubble rate for a specific model depends on which field gets destabilized first .",
    "for instance , @xmath10 can run away to weak coupling @xmath106 due to positive vacuum energy .",
    "thus , during inflation , the dilaton may be destabilized before @xmath13 is , depending on the size of the barrier separating the local minimum in the @xmath10 direction from the run - away minimum .",
    "for instance , in the kallosh - linde model @xcite this barrier is large , so @xmath107 is destabilized before @xmath10 is , while in the usual racetrack model it is the dilaton that gets destabilized first . in any case",
    ", the model  independent bound derived in this paper applies regardless of the moduli stabilization mechanism .",
    "finally , a comment on loop corrections is in order . in the vacuum ,",
    "supersymmetry ( and r - symmetry ) is broken , so one expects susy breaking loop corrections .",
    "these are governed by @xmath108 and can only be relevant to the dilaton direction , whose mass is @xmath109 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such corrections are subleading and since the precise value of the dilaton mass is unimportant for our purposes , we neglect these effects .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the gaugino condensate in the presence of large vacuum energy .",
    "if the expansion rate of the universe is close to or higher than the gaugino condensation scale , the condensate can not be integrated out .",
    "we find that for hubble rates above a critical value , the gaugino condensate evolves to zero which leads to dilaton / moduli destabilization . when the vacuum energy is dominated by the inflaton ( @xmath47 ) other than the field @xmath110 producing the gauge coupling for the condensing gauge group , the critical hubble rate is given by @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath15 being the one loop beta function coefficient .",
    "thus , it is typically an order of magnitude below the corresponding gaugino condensation scale .",
    "this result is independent of the specifics of moduli stabilization and thus provides a useful constraint on inflationary models .",
    "it also applies more generally to any periods of fast expansion in the early universe",
    ".    it would be interesting to further study the cosmological evolution of the dilaton - gaugino condensate system including a background matter or radiation component , to determine which initial conditions lead to dilaton stabilization @xcite",
