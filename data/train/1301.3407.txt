    "this paper is concerned with commuting local hamiltonians ( clhs ) .",
    "a @xmath0-local hamiltonian is a hermitian matrix @xmath3 operating on the hilbert space of @xmath4 @xmath5-dimensional particles , where each term @xmath6 ( sometimes called constraint ) acts non - trivially on at most @xmath0 particles . for the hamiltonian to be a @xmath0-local _ commuting _ hamiltonian we require in addition that every two terms @xmath7 commute ; w.l.o.g we assume in this case that @xmath6 s are projections .",
    "we denote the family of such hamiltonians by @xmath8 .",
    "commutative local hamiltonians have been the subject of very intense research for many years in physics ; as it turns out , clhs are related to some of the deepest questions in quantum computational complexity as well .",
    "let us first provide the background and context for the questions we ask here regarding clhs .",
    "* the computational complexity of the local hamiltonian problem * kitaev first defined in 1998 the local hamiltonian ( lh ) problem , where one is given a local hamiltonian on @xmath4 qudits and two real numbers @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and is asked whether the lowest eigenvalue is at most @xmath11 or larger than @xmath12 ; he showed @xcite that this problem is complete for the class @xmath13 , the quantum analogue of np , providing a quantum counterpart of the celebrated cook - levin theorem .    in 2003 , bravyi and vyalyi @xcite considered the similar decision problem for the commuting case ; the commuting restriction might seem at first sight to devoid the lh problem of its quantum nature , since all terms can be diagonalized together , and moreover , one usually attributes the interesting features of quantum mechanics to its non - commutative nature , cf . the heizenberg uncertainty principle ; following this",
    "one might suspect that the commuting version trivially belongs to np .",
    "this intuition however is misleading , since ground states of clhs can exhibit intricate entanglement phenomenon , such as the topological order exhibited by the toric code @xcite . using clever applications of representations of @xmath14-algebras bravyi and vyalyi",
    "@xcite gave a proof that the two - local commuting case indeed lies within np , and this was generalized later to more general hamiltonian classes @xcite ; however the complexity of the general clh problem remains unresolved .",
    "the resolution of the complexity of the clh problem seems important on its own right , given the importance of commuting hamiltonians in physics , its intriguing nature , its relation to multiparticle entanglement and its connection to topological order .",
    "but apart from these reasons , it is also related to the major open problem of whether a quantum analogue of the celebrated pcp ( probabilistically checkable proof ) theorem holds ; we will discuss this slightly later .       *",
    "clh and quantum error correcting codes * arguably the most important class of quantum error correcting codes are the stabilizer codes ( see @xcite ) ; a stabilizer code is defined by a set of commuting generators , each generator being an element of the ( generalized ) pauli group on @xmath4 @xmath5-dimensional particles , i.e. a tensor product of @xmath4 pauli operators .",
    "the code is defined to be the simultaneous @xmath15 eigenspace of all generators ( therefore these generators are called _ stabilizers _ ) ; if all stabilizers are @xmath0-local ( namely , only @xmath0 out of the @xmath4 pauli s are non - identity ) , this can easily be seen to be equivalent to a ground space of a @xmath8 instance .",
    "thus , clhs and quantum stabilizer codes are intimately connected .",
    "a particularly beautiful example is that of the toric code of kitaev @xcite mentioned before , due to the non - local entanglement it exhibits ; various other stabilizer codes exhibiting topological order were defined ( see e.g. quantum double models @xcite and many other stabilizer codes were constructed and studied ( eg , @xcite ) .",
    "many questions regarding stabilizer codes are of interest with much left to be understood : what are the possible parameters ( distance , rate , etc . ) of such codes , and what are the tradeoffs between those parameters @xcite , how efficient can the description of the states in those codes be @xcite , what are the various properties of such codes with respect to perturbations @xcite and thermal fluctuations @xcite , their behavior in the presence of random noise @xcite , all the above when constraints are restricted to be local , namely , the quantum analogue of ldpc codes ( @xcite and references therein ) , and more .",
    "all those questions can be viewed as questions on clhs , and their resolution is tightly related to our understanding of multiparticle entanglement , and of course to our understanding of the capabilities of quantum error correction .       *",
    "quantum pcp * both the above topics are related to what is now considered a major challenge in quantum complexity theory : the quantum pcp conjecture .",
    "the classical pcp theorem @xcite is arguably the most important discovery in classical theoretical computer science over the past two decades ; it states that there is a polynomial time reduction that maps a given constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) instance ( i.e. , a collection of @xmath0-local constraints on @xmath4 boolean or @xmath5-state variables ) into another csp instance , such that if the original instance is satisfiable , then so is its image , but if the original instance is not satisfiable , then no assignment satisfies more than some constant @xmath16 fraction of constraints in the image instance .",
    "this implies that it is possible to check whether an assignment satisfies a given csp or not , by reading only a constant number of random locations in the assignment ( ! ) .",
    "a major open problem is whether some quantum version of the pcp theorem holds @xcite .",
    "a quantum pcp conjecture can be phrased as follows :    * quantum pcp ( qpcp ) * there exist constants @xmath17 , and a ( quantum ) poly - time algorithm , which takes an instance of a @xmath0-local hamiltonian @xmath18 , to another instance of a @xmath0-local hamiltonian @xmath19 , such that if @xmath18 is satisfiable ( namely , has ground energy @xmath20 ) , then so is @xmath19 , but if @xmath18 is unsatisfiable , the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath19 is at least @xmath21 .    a different way to state",
    "the theorem is to say that even the approximation of the ground energy of the given hamiltonian to within a constant times its norm , is quantum np hard ; an equivalent formulation ( see @xcite for exact statement and a proof ) is that @xmath13-hard problems have a formulation in which the quantum witness can be tested by measuring only a constant number of random qudits .",
    "attempts to extend the classical proofs of the pcp theorem to the quantum settings , or to disprove it , have encountered severe obstacles so far @xcite . in particular , the classical proofs rely heavily on copying classical information ; we can not do the same in the quantum world , due to the no - cloning theorem .",
    "it seems that we do not understand some crucial issue about the local versus global behaviors of entanglement which is central to the problem .",
    "the resolution of the quantum pcp conjecture , either to the positive or the negative , is likely to shed light on multiparticle entanglement , with implications to computational complexity as well as to physics , e.g. , to hardness of approximation in the quantum setting , robustness of quantum correlations at room temperature , quantum error correction , topological order and more .",
    "given the difficulty in making progress on the quantum pcp question so far , it is natural to restrict attention to commuting hamiltonians .",
    "one one hand , one might hope to prove a quantum pcp theorem for commuting hamiltonians , with the hope of borrowing ideas from such a proof to the more general case ( this route might be useful even if eventually the general clh problem turns out to be inside np , which would collapse the commuting pcp theorem into the already known classical pcp theorem ) . on the other hand , upper bounds on the hardness of approximating the clh problem ( such as putting the clh approximation problem inside @xmath22 for certain approximation factors ) could be considered as initial steps towards disproving the general pcp conjecture , or at least as limitations to its strength .",
    "this approach of attacking first the commuting case was taken by aharonov and eldar @xcite , hastings @xcite , and hastings and freedman @xcite .       *",
    "locally testable codes * classical pcp proofs rely heavily on a particular type of error correcting codes , called ltc codes ( locally testable codes ) which are interesting in their own right .",
    "these are codes which satisfy the following property : given a word of fractional distance @xmath23 from the code , we would like to detect that it is not in the code by randomly choosing a constant number @xmath0 out of the @xmath4 locations , and performing a simple test on those locations .",
    "the code is called a locally testable code ( ltc ) if such a test succeeds with probability @xmath24 , given that @xmath23 ( there are variants on this definition , which we will discuss below ) .",
    "note that the requirement for soundness when querying a constant number of locations is reminiscent of the similar goal in the context of pcp , in which querying a constant number of bits of a proof is supposed to detect that the proof is incorrect with constant probability .",
    "indeed , locally testable codes , such as the hadamard and the long code @xcite have played a central role in the proofs of the pcp theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "one can make the connection between the classical pcp theorem and ltcs more rigorous .",
    "it is possible to define a strong version of pcp , called pcp of proximity ( pcpp ) @xcite , which is a structure hidden in most known pcp proofs ; ben - sasson et .",
    "al . showed @xcite how given a pcpp , one can take a good code and construct from it a good ltc code , which inherits its local testability parameters ( soundness and number of queries ) from those of the pcpp @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , quantum ltcs and their robustness were not studied before , and neither was the notion of quantum pcpps .      in this paper",
    "we attempt to gain new insights into the above topics . to do that",
    ", we consider an important facet , central to all the above issues : the topology of the interaction graph underlying the set of constraints .",
    "constraint satisfaction problems on a lattice , both in the quantum and classical case , can be easily approximated in polynomial time to within factors which are even sub - constant .",
    "this is done by throwing away constraints that disconnect the lattice to logarithmic sized boxes which can be solved separately . on the other hand when the underlying graphs of the classical problem are expanders",
    ", the constraint satisfaction problem can exhibit extreme robustness against even constant approximation factors , as in the pcp theorem ( see dinur s proof @xcite ) .",
    "expansion of the interaction graph plays a crucial role in the context of error correcting codes as well ; classical expander codes were defined in @xcite . in the quantum regime",
    "quantum codes on expanders have not been explored very thoroughly , though see @xcite .    in the above mentioned results , expansion is referred to loosely ; several definitions of expansion are used in the literature , and we have not specified which one is being used . to be concrete , we need to choose a good expansion definition for our context .",
    "we first observe that crucially , the graphs we work with are @xmath0-local hypergraphs for @xmath25 .",
    "this because the two - local case of commuting hamiltonians is not interesting from our point of view ; @xmath26-local clh is known to be in np @xcite , and exhibits only local entanglement , and stabilizer codes with @xmath26-local check terms can not correct quantum errors for similar reasons .",
    "we therefore need to work with hypergraphs , or with clhs with @xmath27 locality .",
    "one possible route to take is to use one of the known definitions for expansion in hypergraphs : geometric , homological or spectral ; ( for references and a survey see @xcite ) .",
    "however it is unclear which of those makes more sense and the relations between them are not all known @xcite .",
    "one could also choose to work with a graph underlying the hypergraph ( connecting any two nodes that appear in the same constraint ) ; this definition loses much of the `` structure '' of the original hypergraph .",
    "we choose to work here with the natural bi - partite graph induced by the hypergraph ( as in e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we define the induced bi - partite graph @xmath28 with constraints on the left , and variables / qudits on the right ( see definition [ def : bipgraph ] ) , and a variable is connected to the constraints it appears in .",
    "we say that such a graph is an @xmath1 small - set bi - partite expander , if for any set @xmath29 of size at most @xmath0 particles , the number of local terms incident on these particles is at least @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the right degree of the graph .",
    "we note that @xmath32 is the maximal possible number of constraints acting on those particles , so @xmath1 can be viewed a `` correction '' to this number .",
    "we remark that our definition cares about the expansion of only constant - size sets , whereas usually , one refers to _ small - set expanders _ as those graphs where all sets of size some linear fraction of @xmath33 are required to expand @xcite .",
    "we will address this point also in section ( [ sec : discussion ] ) , following the exposition of our results .",
    "we make use of a very simple property of very good small - set expanders , namely that most of the neighbors of a set of size @xmath0 only touch this set at one point ( see fact [ fact : essence ] in subsection [ subsec : overview ] ) .",
    "this turns out to be an extremely useful property which will bare strong consequences for both the computational complexity of clhs on small - set expanders , as well as for stabilizers whose graphs are small - set expanders .",
    "we start by studying the complexity of the approximate version of the clh problem ; we ask whether we can bound from above the complexity of clh if we are allowed a constant error in the minimal energy ; specifically , if we allow to throw away a certain constant fraction of the constraints ; for that matter , we study what seem to be `` hardest '' class of interaction graphs , namely small set expanders .",
    "we show that the approximation version of the @xmath8 problem becomes \" easy  and falls into np .",
    "( this is of course more surprising if one believes that the general @xmath34 problem is not in @xmath22 ; if on the other hand one believes @xmath34 is in @xmath22 , this can be considered as a step towards this goal . )    our first theorem states that :    [ thm : approxbpinnp ] ( the approximation of clh on small set bi - partite expanders is in np ) let @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath18 be an instance of @xmath8 for constant @xmath36 whose bi - partite interaction graph has a right degree @xmath31 , and is @xmath1-small - set expanding , for @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",
    "then for every eigenspace @xmath39 , there exists a state @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , and such that @xmath40 can be generated by a constant depth quantum circuit . in particular , the @xmath42-approximation problem of @xmath8 on such @xmath1 small - set bi - partite expander graphs is in np .    for the above theorem to be non - trivial",
    ", @xmath1 must be sufficiently small , so that @xmath43 is less than @xmath15 .    one might ask whether theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] is trivially true ; we might have allowed to remove enough terms so that the graph is disconnected into small components and the problem becomes solvable in @xmath44 , just like what happens in the lattice case . we show that this is not the case :    [ thm : nphard ] given @xmath45 , it is @xmath22-hard to approximate @xmath8 whose bi - partite interaction graph is @xmath1 small - set expanding , to within a factor @xmath43 .",
    "theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] can be considered as a first step towards proving that the clh problem lies inside np ;    alternatively , if one takes the point of view that clh is not inside np , and hence that a quantum pcp theorem might in fact be proven via showing hardness of approximations of clhs ( as is the approach of @xcite ) , then theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] puts limitations on such a qpcp . while standard constructions of classical pcp use graphs with excellent small - set expansion ( see the proof of theorem [ thm : nphard ] ) and one can make these graphs have arbitrarily good small - set expansion ( albeit while increasing the degree ) , theorem [ thm : approxbpinnp ] implies that the smaller the expansion error of the graphs underlying the clhs are , the weaker the qpcp theorem using these clhs becomes .",
    "the approximation error for which hardness is shown is bounded from _ above _ by some constant times the expansion error .",
    "this contradicts classical intution .",
    "we discuss this further in the discussion , subsection [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "next , we study the much related topic of stabilizer codes .",
    "in particular , we study how stabilizer codes with local stabilizers behave in the context of local testability .",
    "as mentioned above , classical locally testable codes satisfy the following property : given a word which is of relative distance @xmath46 from the code , then if @xmath46 is not @xmath20 then this fact can be detected with some constant probability @xmath24 by querying a _ constant _ number @xmath0 ( hence , _ locally _ testable ) of coordinates in the code ; one can consider strong ltc codes in which the probability @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath46 , even for sub constant @xmath46 s , or weak @xmath48 codes in which the probability @xmath47 is at least a constant given that @xmath46 is at least a constant .",
    "the essential parameter of ltc codes is thus its robustness , captured roughly by how @xmath47 relates to @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , we say that a locally testable code with degree @xmath31 ( namely , that each qudit is examined by @xmath31 constraints ) is @xmath49-robust if an error on @xmath50 locations violates a at least @xmath51 constraints , namely , a fraction @xmath49 of the maximal number it can possibly violate ( see definitions [ def : weight ] , [ def : robust ] for a rigorous definition of the weight of an error and the robustness for various weights ) .",
    "there are two famous classical ltc codes used in the pcp proofs of @xcite : the long code and hadamard codes .",
    "they exhibit extreme robustness , in the following sense : for any @xmath52 , there exists @xmath23 such that all error patterns of weight at most @xmath50 ( for code - length @xmath4 ) are violated by a fraction at least @xmath53 of their incident ( @xmath54-local ) constraints ) .",
    "we would like to study the robustness of quantum error correcting codes ; to the best of our knowledge , the question of local testability of quantum error correcting codes was not studied yet .",
    "the very notion of weight of an error is not very natural in the context of general quantum error correcting codes ; we leave the general definition to a later version of this paper . for stabilizer codes , however",
    ", the notion of weight of an error is very natural : just count the number of non - identity pauli s in the error ( essentially , modulo the stabilizer group ) . for the rigorous definition see [ def : weight ] .",
    "robustness would thus correspond to how many stabilizers will not commute with such an error .",
    "the robustness of quantum stabilizer codes with local stabilizers seems , on the face of it , to be inherently restricted .",
    "it is illuminating to consider in this context the toric code example @xcite .",
    "the toric code is defined by a set of @xmath55-local constraints on a lattice of @xmath56 by @xmath56 qubits .",
    "it is well known that one can consider a chain of errors of length @xmath57 of qubits , such that the only violated constraints will be those two constraints that touch the end qubits of this chain .",
    "this already indicates very low robustness ( @xmath58 ) for values of @xmath46 of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "it is easy to extend the low robustness behavior to words of linear distance from the code , by scattering short chains of errors of length @xmath60 , which are separated from each other by at least @xmath60 lattice sites .",
    "the message of this part of our paper is that quantum stabilizer codes in general , as long as they have local stabilizers , exhibit inherent non - trivial ( and inherently quantum ) upper bounds on their robustness .    our first result in this context might be viewed as surprising , as once again it poses constraints when the underlying interaction is expanding : it turns out that if the underlying graph is a good small set bi - partite expander , then the robustness is as low as the expansion error itself , for all errors with weight smaller than some constant @xmath46 .",
    "[ thm : qecc ] let @xmath61 be a stabilizer code , with minimal distance @xmath62 , and a @xmath0-local generating set @xmath63 , such that each qudit is examined by @xmath31 generators .",
    "suppose the bi - partite interaction graph of @xmath64 is @xmath1-small set bi - partite expander , for @xmath65 .",
    "then , for all @xmath66 , we have @xmath67 .    in the above",
    "@xmath68 denotes the distance of the code ( see definition [ def : stab ] ) .",
    "theorem [ thm : qecc ] thus provides a trade - off between the expansion and the robustness ; the better the expansion , the worse the robustness .",
    "this seems like an inherently quantum phenomenon , contrary to what happens in the classical world .    to contrast it with the classical setting ,",
    "recall a result by dinur and kaufmann which shows that a robust ltc code must have an interaction graph which is a small - set expander ( theorem 1.1 in @xcite ) ; we note that direct comparison does not hold since the definitions of expansions used are different ; @xcite does not use bi - partite graph expansion but rather the graph in which an edge connects any two nodes that participate in a common constraint .    stronger evidence that theorem [ thm : qecc ] shows a solely quantum phenomenon is given by the construction of _ lossless expanders _ in @xcite .",
    "this construction gives classical error correcting codes whose robustness is very close to @xmath15 .",
    "[ cl : classical ] for any @xmath69 , and @xmath70 there exists a constant @xmath71 , such that there exists an explicit infinite family of codes @xmath72 , of @xmath4 bits , of constant fractional rate @xmath73 , and constant fractional distance @xmath74 , whose check terms are of locality whose _ expectation _ is equal to a constant @xmath0 , and all errors of weight less than @xmath50 have robustness at least @xmath75 .    the proof of this claim is given in the appendix .",
    "we note that contrasting claim [ cl : classical ] with theorem [ thm : qecc ] is not exact , since the classical codes constructed have only average constant degree and not constant degree ; we believe this is not an essential point .",
    "we use theorem [ thm : qecc ] together with a rather involved probabilistic argument , to establish an _ absolute _ non - trivial upper - bound on robustness of stabilizer codes , for errors of size at most some constant relative distance . a semi - trivial such bound exists , due to the size of the alphabet : for a given qudit of dimension @xmath5 , the number of possible errors on one qudit is @xmath76 .",
    "fix a qudit , and pick @xmath77 to be the pauli on that qudit which is most popular among all the stabilizers acting on that qudit .",
    "then at least @xmath78 of the stabilizers on that qudit will commute with that error , and so at most @xmath79 of the stabilizers touching that qudit will not commute with that error , and thus will detect the error ( see fact [ fact : alphabet ] for an exact proof ) .",
    "the robustness is thus bounded by @xmath80 , which we call the _ single - error robustness _ , or the alphabetical upper bound on the robustness .",
    "classically , there is no direct analogue to the requirement of non - commutativity to achieve constraint violation , and hence @xmath81 in the classical case .",
    "we are interested in a deeper phenomenon ; it turns out that for any @xmath0-local stabilizer codes , the robustness must be strictly smaller than the _ single - error robustness_.    [ thm : robust ] ( roughly ) for any stabilizer code @xmath61 of @xmath0-local terms ( @xmath82 ) over @xmath5-dimensional qudits , where each qudit interacts with @xmath31 local terms , errors of weight at most some constant fraction of @xmath4 have robustness at most @xmath83 for some @xmath84 .",
    "this indicates some inherent `` problem '' in the quantum setting when one is interested in maximizing the robustness to make the code most sensitive  ( in terms of energy penalty ) to errors ; understanding this phenomenon might be tightly related to the clarification of the qpcp conjecture .",
    "a @xmath85 of proximity , or @xmath86 , is a form of language verification where the verifier receives , in addition to the usual np - witness to the veracity of the claim made by the prover , an auxiliary proof that allows for a low - query test on whether or not the witness is `` close '' to or `` far '' from the set of acceptable witnesses .",
    "ben sasson et al @xcite provided construction of an ltc code given a pcpp , and described how the parameters are mapped from one to another .",
    "( see construction 4.3 , and proposition 4.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we define quantum pcpps , where the pcpps must be defined with respect to a given set of constraints that can be used .",
    "we then show that a similar result to that of @xcite mapping a quantum pcpp to an ltc with a corresponding set of constraints , holds also in the quantum setting .",
    "thus , limitations on quantum ltc codes translate to limitations on quantum pcpps using similar sets of constraints ; providing an important motivation to understand quantum ltc codes",
    ".    we will delay the definition of quantum pcpp using various sets of constraints , together with the general definition of ltcs ( which use not only stabilizer constraints ) and the above statement connecting the two , to the next version of this paper .",
    "we mention that for now , our bounds on robustness of ltc codes are merely initial indications of the difference between the quantum and the classical ltc behavior , and much is left for improvement in terms of the parameters ; moreover , currently our bounds on the robustness of ltcs hold only for stabilizer codes .",
    "thus , they imply rather limited implications on qpcpps",
    ". however , the connection between qltcs and qpcpps extending the known classical connection between ltcs and pcpps strongly motivates further study of qltcs , as well as improving our parameters and extending our results to other constraints systems ; a deeper study of the implications to the qpcp conjecture of this direction is called for .        given a bi - partite graph @xmath87",
    ", we say a set of nodes in @xmath88 is @xmath1-expanding if @xmath89 where @xmath90 the neighbors of @xmath29 and @xmath31 the right degree .",
    "two basic observations in this paper are the following ; the proofs can be found in the appendix .",
    "( see @xcite for similar observations )    [ fact : essence ] consider @xmath91 in a bi - partite graph @xmath87 and let @xmath29 @xmath1-expanding , for @xmath37 .",

    "much of our current knowledge on the complexity of clh relies on a critical observation by @xcite that any two commuting local terms @xmath96 can be viewed as acting on `` disjoint '' subsystems , using some basic facts from the representation theory of @xmath97-algebra .",
    "informally ( see subsection [ sec : bv ] for a formal description ) , the idea is this .",
    "we consider two terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath6 and @xmath98 , which intersect on some subset of qudits , whose hilbert space is @xmath99 .",
    "bravyi and vyalyi s lemma claims that there exists a local isometry on @xmath99 , preserved by @xmath96 , which if applied , the space of the intersection can be written as a direct sum of subspaces , and in each one , the two terms are `` disconnected '' from each other , so that they essentially act on different subsystems which are in tensor product .",
    "in other words , @xmath100    such that @xmath6 ( @xmath98 ) restricted to the @xmath101 subspace acts non trivially only on the left ( right ) subsystem , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this lemma was used by @xcite to show that @xmath26-local clhs ( corresponding to graphs ) are in np ; however as was noted in @xcite more is needed in the case of hypergraphs .    in the context of expanders ,",
    "we use it as follows . given a constraint @xmath6 ,",
    "if we now remove all terms that share at least @xmath26 vertices with @xmath6 , ( and this , by claim [ fact : essence ] is just a small portion of the terms intersecting that term ) we get into a situation in which all terms that intersect @xmath6 , intersect it at only one particle .",
    "this makes the intersection pattern simple enough , so that bravyi and vyalyi s lemma @xcite can be applied almost directly on each of the qudits on which the terms acts on .",
    "the final result is that the term @xmath6 can be separated from the remaining terms and can be viewed ( up to the relevant isometries ) as acting on a separated subsystem .    how to use this insight to show that the approximation to within a small constant is in np ?",
    "it is not enough to simply take away , for each term , all terms that make it isolated , as this will require removing too many terms .",
    "instead , we use the above idea iteratively . at each iteration",
    "we choose a local term @xmath104 and `` isolate '' it ( see definition [ def : isolate ] ) : we remove as many terms as necessary so that among the remaining terms , no local term shares more than one particle with @xmath104 ( see figure [ fig : ex1 ] ) .",
    "bravyi and vyalyi s lemma can then be applied , and @xmath104 can be separated from the rest , after restricting the qudits to the relevant subspaces in their direct sum of equation [ eq : sum ] .",
    "now we can continue in the same way , starting from the restricted subspace .",
    "this way we gradually `` tear - away '' local subspaces of particles .",
    "the analysis of the upper bound on the number of terms that need to be removed altogether requires some thought , since the number of particles does not necessarily decrease through one iteration ; it is only their dimensionality that decreases .",
    "we resort to an amortized analysis counting the number of _ dimensions _ that are removed in total .",

    "the proof of theorem ( [ thm : nphard ] ) that the approximation problem on small - set expanders is np - hard follows from the observation that the output of the pcp amplification routine due to dinur ( @xcite ) is an excellent small - set expander .      to prove theorem [ thm : qecc ]",
    ", we argue that a stabilizer code whose underlying interaction graph is a good enough bi - partite small - set expander , can not be too robust . to do this , we define a particular error pattern , which has a large weight modulo the stabilizer , but which does not violate too many generators .",
    "the error pattern we define acts on one qubit in each one of a set of `` isolated '' terms . by `` isolated '' term ( formally , @xmath105-independent terms - see definition [ def : lind ] ) , we mean something completely different than the previously used isolated qudits ; a set of terms is @xmath105-indepdent if no two terms in it are closer than some constant in the interaction graph .",
    "picking one qudit in each term , we claim that the weight of this error can not decrease when multiplied by an element from the group .",
    "intuitively , this is because of the following reason ; if such an error pattern can be represented more succinctly , there must be one single qudit whose error is removed modulo the stabilizer group , and moveover , no new errors appear ( modulo the group , again ) in a constant but large enough neighborhood of that qudit .",
    "we show that this can not happen since the stabilizers are too local .",
    "we need to design an error pattern whose robustness will be limited . by examining the code itself , we can `` distill '' an error which causes a minimal number of violated constraints .",

    "a vast majority of the terms acting on it intersects @xmath106 at only one location .",

    "our proof relies on bounding the robustness of a quantum ltc from two sides . on one hand ,",
    "we use the bound of theorem ( [ thm : qecc ] ) which is , in fact , the `` surprising '' side , which implies that high expansion forces low robustness .",
    "we then add a new claim showing that quantum stabilizers , not only suffer from the quantum effect of ( [ thm : qecc ] ) but also , can not avoid , the `` classical '' effect that codes with poor expansion have low robustness .",
    "we restrict our attention to sets of qudits belonging to generators which are `` far '' away from each other in the interaction graph of the generating set . given a set of qudit `` islands '' with poor collective expansion",
    ", we try to find an error on this set which has less - than - optimal number of violations .",
    "at least intuitively , a set with poor expansion , can not have full robustness , since if `` all '' bits of the set are erroneous there are less than an optimal number of constraints examining this set , so there would be less - than - optimal number of violations .",
    "however , this intuition on its own is insufficient , since we do nt know whether or not we can find an error whose weight will be the entire set . rather , we resort to using a random error , so that only a small fraction of the set is erred .",
    "we show , as a sub - claim that on average , even a random error which is `` sparse '' on the set , will still sense the fact that the complete set has sub - optimal expansion , and would yield less than optimal number of violations .",
    "the fact that the resulting error has large weight modulo the centralizer follows from an observation we prove , that each `` island '' of qudits can not have its errors `` erased '' via a more succinct representation , if most of the `` island '' is uninhabited , i.e. less than @xmath108 of the qudits are erred .",
    "we then have a fine trade - off : on one hand , we would like the number of errors on a given `` island '' to be smaller than @xmath108 , and on the other hand , we would like a good portion of `` islands '' to have at least @xmath26 errors , so that they `` sense '' the sub - optimal expansion .",
