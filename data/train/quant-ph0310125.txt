    "a quantum wave packet @xmath0 evolving from a uniform initial superposition state @xmath1 displays interesting quantum interference phenomena which involve self - affine fractal quantum evolution of the probability densities and quantum revivals .",
    "this was shown by berry @xcite in a study of quantum waves confined in boxes by dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it was pointed out that the choice of hard wall boundaries introduces quantum fractal noise in the time evolution of uniform deterministic systems obeying the schr@xmath2dinger s equation , which is expressed via a self - affine fractal probability density @xmath3 . moreover , over long periods of time at integer multiples of the revival time @xmath4 , the wave packet @xmath0 returns and reconstructs in its initial form @xcite . in a wide class of circumstances the quantum revivals are almost perfect with both space and time periodic @xmath3 .    most studies are concerned with spectra having a quadratic dependence on the quantum number , such as the simple case of the infinite potential well @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where perfect and fractional revivals occur at integer and fractional multiples of the revival time @xmath4 , respectively @xcite . for quadratic spectra with wave packets localized in energy space around a quantum number @xmath7",
    "the classical time @xmath8 and the much longer revival time @xmath9 are the only time scales @xcite . for more complex energy dispersions , such as the rydberg states @xmath10 @xmath6 higher order time scales exist apart from the classical , e.g. 1st order , 2nd order , etc , recurrences , as shown for the  return to the origin \" probability in the book by peres @xcite .",
    "the classical revolution time for a wave packet starting around the @xmath7th orbit is @xmath11 , while the 1st order recurrences occur at integer multiples of the revival time @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the classical time scale @xmath13 defines the time up to which the system follows a classical orbit while the revival time scale @xmath4 resembles the ehrenfest time where the classical liouville density ceases to describe the system , since quantum interference makes itself obvious with gradual spreading and distortion of the wave packet .",
    "the classical and revival times are inversely proportional to the energy eigenvalue separation and its variation , respectively @xcite .",
    "the full quantum limit @xmath14 is approached for much longer times .",
    "the quantum evolution of wave packets which consist of a large number of simultaneously excited eigenstates is related via the uncertainty principle to ultrashort laser pulses of femtosecond duration . in this way one can study the evolution of a coherent superposition of many quantum states .",
    "the quantum evolution of such superpositions can be realised in the physics of rydberg atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , semiconductor quantum wells @xcite , mode propagation of bose - einstein condensates in magnetic wave guides @xcite , laser prepared states in ionic traps @xcite , etc . on the other hand , from studying squeezed wave packets with reduced spatial uncertainty , in order to behave like particles as much as possible , one gains a deep insight into the semi - classical limit where quantum and classical physics meet according to the correspondence principle .",
    "the quantum evolution is qualitatively milder than the classical one and it remembers the initial state , due to the reversible and unitary nature of the quantum evolution transformation @xmath15 . for classical evolution",
    "the initial state always converges to a stationary distribution .",
    "we show that quantum memory effects exist and a self - affine fractal space and time distribution of the probability density @xmath3 .",
    "quantum revivals also appear in the  return to the origin \" probability .",
    "they might be interesting for fundamental issues , such as the use of quantum mechanics in computation @xcite .",
    "it was shown that space - time interference which repeats itself at discrete time intervals can create a subatomic quantum counter @xcite and can help towards implementation of factorization for an integer number into primes exploring fractional revivals @xcite ( see also the @xmath16-slit interferometer in @xcite ) .",
    "our study may also be relevant to another aspect of quantum information theory , which is the newborn subject of quantum random walks ( e.g. the hadamard walk ) @xcite .",
    "a quantum walk is iterated by combining the usual translation with a rotation in ",
    "space , where a quantum coin - flip replaces the classical coin - flip . of course one should avoid any measurement at intermediate times @xcite .",
    "the quantum walk has an improved behavior over the classical random walk since it is characterized by ballistic ( quadratic dependence of the mean square displacement in time ) , instead of the usual diffusive ( mean square displacement linear in time ) of the classical evolution . it is a general feature of one - particle quantum algorithms to speed up quadratically when compared to classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the quantum evolution is analogous to the classical phenomenon of geometrical optics known as the talbot effect @xcite .",
    "talbot inspected a coarsely ruled diffraction grating illuminated with white light through a magnifying lens . when the lens held close to the grating , the rulings appeared in sharp focus , as expected .",
    "however , moving the lens away , the rulings of the grating first appeared blurred , as expected , but then reappeared in sharp focus at multiples of a particular distance , known as the talbot distance .",
    "in the talbot effect the pattern of intensity is doubly periodic , both across the grating and as a function of distance from the grating .",
    "more discussion on the talbot effect and its analogies with the quantum problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "although the quantum revivals are semiclassical in nature quantum interference exists since these semiclassical phenomena appear only close to the quantum limit @xmath17 .    in this paper , as an alternative to continuous media we aim to study quantum evolution of wave packets moving in tight - binding lattices .",
    "a discrete and finite space is important for simulations on a finite computer with the possibility of mapping it to a quantum computer .",
    "this study is a general scheme for discetizing space when one deals with linear equations ( such as the quantum schrodinger s equation ) , which turns out to be particularly useful when the geometry plays an important role .",
    "it complies with the necessity to exploit possibilities for the information space , which is also discrete , opposite to the continuous classical phase space .",
    "this convenient computational tool for implementing space is favored by the presence of an underlying lattice in solid state applications .",
    "we discuss two cases : ( i ) the ballistic motion in the case of zero site potential where quantum interference from wave scattering at the hard walls creates a sort of quantum  randomness \" similarly to that of the  particle in a box \" , and ( ii ) a diffusive case via a special quasi - periodic potential of critical strength @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that quantum diffusive evolution is very different from classical diffusion although the space fractal dimension of the quantum probability is the same .",
    "the spectrum is of the @xmath18 type and the stationary eigenstates are simple @xmath19 elementary trigonometric functions so that the evolution can be characterized by an infinity of other time scales apart from @xmath13 , @xmath4 . in the ballistic case",
    "the motion remains ballistic for all @xmath20 since the tight binding lattice has no small @xmath20 semiclassical limit .",
    "our results confirm the presence of fractal fluctuations of the probability distribution during the ballistic and diffusive quantum evolution , in agreement with berry @xcite .",
    "moreover , for all kinds of quantum noise the fractal noise is described by the predicted universal fractal dimensions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the self - affine curves .",
    "for the ballistic motion the mean square distance increases proportionally to the square of the elapsed time while for quantum diffusion the mean square distance increases proportionally to time .",
    "the self - affinity seen in the noisy quantum evolution is familiar in non - linear systems .",
    "therefore , techniques from non - linear physics can be used to understand some of the mysteries of quantum mechanics , particularly quantum evolution in open systems in the presence of time - dependent potentials .",
    "we have created space - time structures on the discrete orthonormal finite lattice space basis @xmath24 for various continuous times @xmath20 . for the ballistic quantum evolution in a line",
    "the mean - square displacement grows quadratically @xmath25 .",
    "it can be expressed via the stationary eigensolutions of the hamiltonian @xmath26 through the evolution operator @xmath27 , since @xmath26 is time - independent .",
    "the static schrodinger s equation @xmath28 , @xmath29 corresponding to the matrix @xmath26 , which is tridiagonal for a one - dimensional lattice with zero diagonal entries and constant off - diagonal elements , has stationary eigenvalues , eigenvectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the quantum evolution of the initial ket @xmath32 can be expressed as |(t ) & = & e^-iht/|(0 ) + & = & _ j=1^ne^-ie_jt/|j j|(0)so that the space - time wave function reads ( x , t ) & = & x |(t ) + & = & _",

    "the amplitude @xmath40 is real and the transformation from the spatial @xmath41 to the eigenstate @xmath42 basis or its inverse from @xmath42 to @xmath41 are the same . in this case",
    "the computations of the space - time wave function @xmath0 at various times are particularly simple by replacing the eigenvalues @xmath43 , eigenvector amplitudes @xmath44 in eq .",

    "firstly , the initial wave was released on a @xmath45 state at one end of the chain with @xmath46 which from eq .",
    "( 3 ) at later times gives the probability p(x , t)= |(x , t)|^2=    @xmath43 , eigenvectors @xmath47 .",
    "this gives an almost classical evolution of a point particle seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) where the particle at time @xmath48 returns to its initial position .",
    "the quantum revival resembles a classical particle moving with constant velocity which reflects at the boundaries at @xmath49 and returns to its original position @xmath50 .",
    "our second initial choice was the spatial superposition in space @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath53 for all @xmath33 , which gives from eq .",
    "( 3 ) the normalized space - time probability p(x , t ) = |(x , t)|^2 & = & |_j=1^n e^-ie_jt/_x=1^nc_x^(j ) * c_x^(j)|^2 .",

    "1 . repeat indefinitely at time @xmath13 , but less and less less accurately each time .",
    "we observe the quantum evolution for a uniform initial wave function along the chain as a function of space freezing the time , as a function of time at a single site or varying space positions equal to time .",
    "the corresponding pictures are shown in figure 2 where interesting self - affine fractal oscillations are seen .",
    "for the spatial distribution our simple computations for the fractal dimension coincide with the value @xmath66 predicted by berry .",
    "this value coincides with the displacement curve of classical random walks which gives brownian noise .",
    "quantum  randomness \" described by the fractal dimension @xmath21 arises from the linear schrodinger s equation , only due to quantum interference from scattering at the boundaries .",

    "the @xmath22 is higher than @xmath21 as it can be seen form the more noisy oscillating of the probability density as a function of time t. we also display a space - time function along the diagonal @xmath68 where the self - affine fluctuations are much smaller with @xmath69 .",
    "the capacity ( box ) dimension of the self - affine @xmath70 curves is computed by counting boxes of linear size @xmath71 along the x - axis axis and of size @xmath72 along the y - axis .",
    "it must be noted that a similarity dimension can not be defined since for a self - affine curve scaling is different along the two axes .",
    "we have used integer time units so the minimum box width along the x - axis is taken @xmath73 and use a high - resolution grid for the amplitude along the y - axis .",
    "this is required in order to obtain the  local \" non - integer fractal dimension @xmath74 of the self - affine curves , while larger values of @xmath75 finally give the well known  global \" fractal dimension @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the selected values of @xmath75 were of order of @xmath77 for both the space @xmath21 and time @xmath22 dimensions .",

    "a linear fit of the scaling equation is displayed in the log - log plots of the corresponding insets of fig.2 which gives @xmath74 from the slope . as pointed out above the obtained results for @xmath80",
    "are in agreement with the values for the fractal dimensions predicted by berry @xcite . for the other initial conditions considered",
    "we find similar fractal dimensions although with errors arising from the small sizes ( see fig .",
    "the  survival \" or  return to the origin \" probability is defined from the squared absolute amplitude overlap p_0(t)=|(0)|(t)|^2 which can be computed from eq .",
