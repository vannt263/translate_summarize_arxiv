    "@xcite attributed this switch from a flat , broad spectrum to the form seen in fig .  [ fig - spectra](d ) to a transition from continuous mass outflow to a detached shell .",
    "this would indicate a chronology in which continuous mass outflow ceases prior to day  15 , followed by the expansion of the optically thick detached shell .",
    "however we are not convinced that the changes in the profile require the end of mass outflow .",

    ", the ejecta becomes optically thin in the visible wavelength range between days  195 and 285 .",
    "this places some time constraints on future modelling of nova ejecta .",
    "a simple gaussian fit to the radio emission structure indicates that on day  137 the major axis is 265@xmath616  mas at position angle ( east of north ) 110.7@xmath64.2  degrees , minor axis 155@xmath69  mas .",
    "this agrees well with the extent of the emission on the image ( fig .",
    "[ fig - merlin ] ) .",
    "in addition the separation of the peaks of the two radio components is 120@xmath65  mas .",
    "the position angle differs from that of @xmath21140  degrees found around optical maximum by @xcite using spectropolarimetry .",
    "however given the breadth of the radio features in fig .",
    "[ fig - merlin ] the image seems consistent with extension in the general south ",
    "east to north ",
    "west direction , as seen at early times by @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a number of maximum  magnitude  rate  of  decline relationships to find a distance of 3.6@xmath60.3  kpc .",
    "@xcite find reddening amounting to a@xmath31 = 1.8 , and consequently a modified distance of 1.6@xmath60.2  kpc .",
    "using this latter distance estimate we can use the observed extent of the radio emission to estimate an ejection velocity .",
    "this leads to values ranging from 980@xmath680  km  s@xmath8 to 2500@xmath6200  km  s@xmath8 depending on whether the major or minor axes or the peak to peak separation are used in the calculation .",
    "this velocity range is entirely consistent with that derived from the spectra and presented in table  [ tab - hbeta ] and confirms that the radio continuum arises from the same material as the optical lines .",
    "thus it may be that at this stage of the development of the radio emission ( whilst the remnant is still largely optically thick at these wavelengths ) it is valid to compare the extent of the remnant on the sky ( fig .",
    "[ fig - merlin ] ) with velocities derived from hydrogen spectra to derive a distance to classical novae .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the spectral line profiles are consistent with a nearly edge  on equatorial ring of the sort modelled by @xcite .",
    "we feel given the width of the individual components this conclusion can not be directly supported ; we do not rule out such a structure but the spectra do not require it . nonetheless we can examine the possibility that our merlin image ( fig .",
    "[ fig - merlin ] ) represents emission from a tilted ring . assuming that the major axis of the brightness distribution on the sky represents the diameter of an equatorial ring , we take foreshortening due to the tilt to lead to the ellipticity . consequently the minor axis can be compared with the major axis to give an angle of inclination to the line  of  sight of @xmath32 , which can not be considered edge  on",
    "however it does agree well with the findings of @xcite who reconcile high radial velocities of absorption lines in the early decline with lower emission line widths in the later nebular stage .",
    "they suggest the ejecta take the form of a ring with an angle to the line of sight of 30@xmath33 , also in agreement with our angle above . in this case",
    "the intrinsic velocities are twice as large as those observed and may at least partly explain why the high velocities derived from the spherically symmetric model for the radio emission presented in section  [ ssec - model_fitting ] are inconsistent with the velocities derived from the optical spectroscopy .",
    "we note @xcite also suggest the presence of high  velocity jets in v1494  aql .",
    "these could also be a source of the elongation in the radio emission , and the velocities of the jets are consistent with emission of the angular extent seen .",
    "however it is difficult to see how the radio emission could be reconciled with both fast jets and an inclined ring of material ; either one or the other must have caused the observed structure .",
    "given that our merlin observations are contemporaneous with the nebular stage as defined by @xcite it seems simplest to associate the observed structure in the radio with an inclined ring ; the size scale also agrees with this interpretation .",
    "this does not mean jets were not present also , only that they were not visible to merlin .",
    "we can use some very simple assumptions to gain a model ",
    "independent estimate of the mass of the ejecta .",
    "assuming ejecta formed of pure , ionised hydrogen , the mass might be estimated as @xmath34 for an electron density @xmath35 , hydrogen atom mass @xmath36 and ejecta volume @xmath37 .",
    "we estimate @xmath37 by assuming that the major and minor axes of the emission on the sky are the major and minor axes of the ellipsoidal ejecta , and that the intermediate axis is the mean of these two . taking into account continous mass ejection , we find the volume of the shell occupied by the ejecta on day  136 to be @xmath38  m@xmath39 at a distance of 1.6  kpc .",
    "this gives @xmath40  m@xmath3 .",
    "this is comparable with the total mass estimate of @xcite , but significantly less than our estimate from model fitting .",
    "if mass ejection had ended on day  15 , the ejecta would only occupy around 30% of this volume , with a corresponding @xmath41  m@xmath3 .",
    "we present a number of observations of the remnant of the classical nova v1494  aql .",
    "these begin 4  d after visual maximum with sub ",
    "mm data from the jcmt , followed by cm ",
    "band data after 136  d ( merlin ) and 187  d ( vla ) and finally optical spectroscopy on @xmath21194  d and @xmath21284  d ( uags ) .",
    "together these observations probe the ejecta over a period of 20  weeks , from the early `` fireball '' stage to the final optically thin phase as the radio emission begins to fade away .",
    "comparison between the radio image and spectroscopy is consistent with a distance of 1.6  kpc .",
    "both the optical spectra and the radio imaging demonstrate the early clumpy structure of the ejecta around classical novae .",
    "most importantly it conclusively shows that simple spherical models of the ejecta development are insufficient to predict the behaviour over the time and wavelength domain sampled here ( 183  days , 450@xmath9 m to 20  cm ) .",
    "clearly new models for radio emission from novae must be developed which address departures from spherical symmetry and the clumpy nature of the ejecta .",
    "furthermore it is essential to investigate in detail how the predicted brightness distributions from such models would be seen by radio interferometers such as merlin if we are to confidently reconcile features in the radio images with structures in the ejecta .",
    "we find that the emission is consistent with either an inclined ring or jets of ejecta ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but not both ; we are inclined to associate it with the former rather than the latter .",
    "we also find data consistent with mass ejection continuing for six months after the outburst right up to the ejecta starting to become optically thin in the visible regime after day 195 .",
