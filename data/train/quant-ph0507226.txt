    "coherence and entanglement are two remarkable features of quantum systems , and they are also dominating reasons why quantum computation and quantum communication differ from the classical ones @xcite .",
    "for example , quantum coherence can lead to natural parallel computations which can enhance efficiency for solving some complex problems by using effective quantum algorithms .",
    "quantum bit ( qubit ) is a key block for building quantum computers .",
    "however , the interactions of qubits with their environment will induce loss of the coherence , decoherence .",
    "decoherence is considered a central impediment to fabricate quantum computers . in quantum computation and quantum communication ,",
    "the entanglement , nonlocal correlation between the quantum subsystems is also needed .",
    "the entanglement is recognized as an important physical resource in quantum information transmission and processing .",
    "many protocols in quantum communication and quantum computation are based on the entangled states .",
    "it is also shown that couplings of the quantum systems and its subsystems to their environment will result in the loss of the entanglement , and this loss can not be restored by local operations and classical communications @xcite .",
    "both the decoherence and the loss of the entanglement may result from the interactions of the quantum systems with their environment . then , what relations are there between the two quantities ? in this paper",
    "we will investigate the relationship of the decoherence and the loss of entanglement for a non - exactly solvable two - qubit model .",
    "as ref.privman-tolkunov-1,privman-tolkunov-2 , let us refer to two subsystems , @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the combined system , @xmath2 the evolutions of the coherence of the subsystems @xmath3 and @xmath4 in their bathes can be described by suppression factors , @xmath5 on the other hand , the evolutions of the entanglement between the subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath4 can be described by entanglement of formation @xcite expressed by concurrence concurrence . in large times the decay of the coherent terms are exponential , then the decay rate of the whole system is the summation of the rates of the subsystems @xcite@xmath6 yu and eberly @xcite found that for a exactly solvable model in which the decoherence is caused by pure dephasing process , the concurrence decays faster than the quantum dephasing of an individual qubit .",
    "a more physical model , two entangled atoms in pure vacuum noise , is investigated recently by the same authors @xcite .",
    "they found that the disentanglement time is shorter than the usual spontaneous lifetime .",
    "v. privman _",
    "@xcite investigated another dynamically solvable model .",
    "they shown that the _ decay of concurrence _ of the model is governed by the product of suppression factors describing decoherence of the subsystems ( qubits ) in a short time .",
    "it is interesting that whether or not the relationship of the concurrence and the suppression factors describing the decoherence can be held for other open quantum systems . in this paper",
    "we shall investigate a different open two - qubit model whose dynamics is not exactly solvable . by using a short - time approximation",
    "we can obtain the evolution of reduced density matrix of the system .",
    "it will be shown that as the initial state of the two - qubit system is the maximum entangled states the decay of concurrence , namely the decay of the degree of entanglement of formation can also be governed by the product of suppression factors describing decoherence of the subsystems ( qubits ) in a short time .",
    "if the initial state is not the maximum entangled state , the concurrence will decrease faster than the product of the suppression factors describing the coherence of the qubits does .",
    "suppose the open two - qubit system has hamiltonian@xmath7where@xmath8here , we use the subscripts or the superscripts @xmath9 to label the qubits .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the hamiltonian of qubits and their bosonic bathes and @xmath12 are the interactions of the qubits with their bathes @xcite . where we assume that each qubit interacts with its own bath .",
    "this is not a exactly solvable model .",
    "if we do not consider the interactions between the qubits the evolution operator of the combined system can be expressed as@xmath13the evolution operator of the single qubit is@xmath14where @xmath15 due to non - conservation of @xmath16 in this system , the evolution operator can not be in a general way expressed as @xmath17 but in the sort - time approximation , the operator can be approximately expressed as split - operator01,split - operator02@xmath18it has been proved that the expression is accurate enough as the time being short to the characteristic time @xcite .",
    "so the elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath19 in the basis of operator @xmath20 can be expressed as@xmath21here , we suppose the initial state of the system be @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are initial states of the qubit and its environment .",
    "the latter is the product of the bath modes density matrices  @xmath25 . in the initial states , each bath mode @xmath26",
    "is assumed to be thermalized , namely,@xmath27where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the temperature and @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant .      in this subsection",
    "we shall investigate the decoherence of each qubit due to the interaction of the qubit with its own environment , a bath . here , we denote the suppression factors describing the decoherence of each qubits with @xmath30 .",
    "the relationship of the suppression factors @xmath30 with the usual term decoherence @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the initial coherent terms of the density matrix , namely , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix of the initial state for the @xmath34 qubit . @xmath35 for the initial states with maximum coherent terms .",
    "we call @xmath36 the _ decay of coherence _ of the @xmath34 qubit .",
    "usually , the environment is assumed to be a large macroscopic the interaction with it leads to the thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath29 . in this case ,",
    "markovian type approximations can be used to quantified the decoherent process and it usually yields the exponential decay of the density matrix elements in the energy basis of the hamiltonian @xmath37 thus , the decay rates will be additive . in this time",
    "scale the measures of entropy and the first entropy can be used for quantifying the decoherence .",
    "but the decoherence of the qubit gate operations can not be characterized by this methods because the time of the elementary quantum gate operation is much shorter than the thermal relaxation time .",
    "it has been shown that the norms @xmath38 is useful for describing the decoherence of the short - time evolution @xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 is the deviation operator defined as @xmath40where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are density matrixes of the `` real ''  evolution ( with interaction ) and the `` ideal ''  one ( without interaction ) of the @xmath34 qubit .",
    "we can use the norm @xmath38 describing the decoherence and the norm is defined as @xcite@xmath43for a qubit , the norm can be given by @xmath44it is shown that for a given system , the norm @xmath45 increase with time , reflecting the decoherence of the system .",
    "however , in general it is oscillated at the system s internal frequency .",
    "thus , the decohering effect of the bath is better quantified by the maximal operator norm @xmath46for our investigating model , by using eqs.([e6 ] ) and [ e11 ] ) we can obtain the decoherence of the qubit as @xmath47where @xmath48it is shown that the suppression factor describing the decoherence of the open qubit @xmath49 is@xmath50      numerous measures of entanglement have been considered over the years . for quantum information content , the entanglement of formation has been a widely accepted measure of entanglement .",
    "the measure can measure the degree of entanglement not only for pure states but also for mixed states .",
    "the concurrence is a quantity monotonically related to the entanglement of formation . for a pure or mixed state , @xmath51 of two qubits",
    ", one can define the spin - flipped state,@xmath52and the hermitian matrix,@xmath53with eigenvalues @xmath54 . here",
    ", @xmath55 denotes the complex conjugation of @xmath56 in the standard basis and @xmath57 is one of the pauli matrixes .",
    "the concurrence , @xmath58 , is defined by concurrence@xmath59from eq.([e6 ] ) and helped with operator - algebra techniques we can obtain the evolutions of the reduced density matrix as@xmath60where@xmath61 in the right hand side of eq.([e19 ] ) we denote @xmath62 with @xmath63 if we do not consider the interactions between the qubits , the reduced density matrix of the combined system @xmath64 becomes@xmath65 in the following , we set the system in a pure entangled state@xmath66at @xmath67 , where@xmath68 .",
    "\\label{e22}\\]]the concurrence of the initial state is @xmath69 at first , we investigate an especial case , namely , the case of @xmath70 , which denotes the initial state is a maximum entangled state .",
    "we can easily obtain that after time @xmath71 the density matrix of the open two - qubit system becomes@xmath72 .",
    "\\label{e23}\\]]where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 then , we can obtain the eigenvalues of the product @xmath75 as@xmath76and@xmath77finally , we can obtain the concurrence as@xmath78we call the @xmath79 the decay of entanglement .",
    "the loss of the entanglement is @xmath80 .",
    "if we set @xmath81 or @xmath82 we can obtain some similar results .",
    "it is very interesting that in this case the suppression factors describing the decoherence of the qubits and the entanglement of formation between the two qubits still has the compact relationship as ref.@xcite .",
    "but , if the relationship is still preserved for other initial states ? in the following we shall investigate the cases that the initial states are not the maximum entangled states .",
    "when @xmath83 or @xmath82 the operator calculations similar to above derivation becomes very complex , then we only be able to numerically investigate this problem with a concrete bath model .",
    "suppose the two bathes with ohmic noise spectrum are the same for convenience , which do not loss the universality .",
    "the spectral densities of the bathes may be expressed as@xmath84it is well - known that when the summation in eq.([e13 ] ) is converted to the integration in the limit of infinite number of the bath modes , one has@xmath85for the real @xmath86 @xmath87 in this paper we choose the cutoff frequency of the bath modes as @xmath88 @xmath89 it is pointed that the dimensionless strength of the dissipation is very small for some qubit environment .",
    "for example , for the josephson charge qubit in ohmic bath the value of @xmath90 is about @xmath91 @xcite@xmath6 in our calculations , if we take @xmath92 the difference of the decay of concurrence @xmath79 and the  product of the suppression factors @xmath93 with a initial concurrence @xmath94 is very small .",
    "for convenience , where we denote @xmath95 when we increase @xmath90 to @xmath96 we can clearly see that the decay of concurrence decreases faster than @xmath97 does . in fig.1",
    "we plot @xmath79 versus time ( with points ) , which is compared with @xmath97 ( with lines ) in different initial states where ( a ) @xmath98 ( b ) @xmath99 and ( c ) @xmath100 .",
    "it is shown that the concurrence is not equals to the product of suppression factors and its initial concurrence , namely @xmath97 except for @xmath70 . in plotting of the figure",
    "we choose a time unit , @xmath101 for convenience .",
    "where we set @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 . from fig.1",
    "we see that the durative time of our calculations is @xmath105 , which is smaller than the characteristic time of the qubits @xcite .",
    "so our calculations is accurate enough .",
    "it is shown that system@xmath106where@xmath107is also a non - exactly solvable model and it has the same dynamics to system eqs.([e1]-[e2 ] ) in short - time approximation @xcite .",
    "so the concurrence and the suppression factors describing the decoherence of the system may have a similar relationship to system eqs.([e1]-[e2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we investigated a non - exactly solvable open two - qubit model .",
    "we obtained that in a short time the decay of entanglement of formation is governed by the product of the suppression factors describing decoherence of the subsystems as the initial state of the two - qubit system is the maximum entangled state .",
    "this novel relationship is similar to the discover by v. privman _ et al . _ in @xcite , where the open two - qubit system is exactly solvable .",
    "our work shows that when the initial state is not a maximum entangled state , after the open two - qubit evolve a short time @xmath71 the entanglement of formation , concurrence decrease faster than the product of the suppression factors describing the decoherence of the two - qubit system , which is similar to the discover by yu and eberly in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that when the dissipation is not very weak ( the dimensionless strength of the dissipation @xmath108 ) the entanglement is distinctly more frangible than the coherence for the quantum systems .    the project was supported by national natural science foundation of china ( grant no .",
