    "recently alternative mechanisms were proposed which generate the primordial curvature perturbations after inflation , not from the inflaton fluctuations . in curvaton scenario",

    "preheating @xcite is a process in which the coherent oscillation of the inflaton excites the fluctuations of fields coupled to the inflaton by parametric resonance .",
    "this process was investigated in detail @xcite without metric perturbations , which is valid in dealing processes occurring well within the horizon scale .",
    "it was then recognized that particle production in preheating occurs much more efficiently than in the old reheating scenario where inflaton decays perturbatively to other particles .",
    "naively , fluctuations of such fields coupled to the inflaton seem to be excellent source of isocurvature perturbations .",
    "this means there is a possibility of generating curvature perturbations on super - horizon scales during preheating epoch .",

    "as is well known , at @xmath30 the curvature perturbation on comoving hypersurface , @xmath12 becomes constant in time on super - horizon scales .",
    "we define the background @xmath31-folding number as @xmath32 according to @xcite , taking the initial @xmath33 hypersurface to be flat and the final @xmath34 hypersurface to be comoving , there is a simple relation between @xmath9 and the perturbation of the background @xmath31-folding number as @xmath35 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 represents the comoving curvature perturbation on super - horizon scale , @xmath26 , and @xmath37 represents the @xmath31-folding number measured from @xmath27 to @xmath29 along the world line @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate the final curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales , it is only necessary to calculate the difference in the @xmath31-folding number measured from the initial to final hypersurfaces between separate frw universes .",
    "it should be also noted that we only assume that the metric perturbations on super - horizon scales are linear perturbations , while we do not assume the linearity of the matter fields in the frw universes here .",
    "hence we can also use this formula for the case in which the dynamics of matter fields is non - linear , such as in preheating .    in our calculation , we obtain the @xmath31-folding numbers of separate homogeneous universes from @xmath27 to @xmath29 , given the different values of @xmath14 on initial hypersurface at @xmath39 .",
    "we take the @xmath40 hypersurface to be constant hubble one , that is , @xmath41 , rather than comoving hypersurface because it is much easier to handle in the numerical calculations .",
    "it is well known that the constant hubble hypersurface is identical to the comoving hypersurface after complete reheating , that is , during the universe is characterized by a single parameter , e.g. , the energy density of the radiation .",
    "we consider a two - field preheating model whose effective potential is given by eq .",

    "( [ int2 ] ) .    if we allow the non - minimal negative coupling @xmath55 as an additional interaction to the effective potential eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) @xcite , the effective mass squared of @xmath14-field is @xmath56 since the second term decreases faster than the first one as @xmath13 decreases , it is possible that the second term dominates during inflation but becomes negligible during preheating . in this case",
    ", the power spectrum of @xmath14 at the end of inflation can be red rather than scale - invariant . in the following discussions",
    ", we do not fix the initial power spectrum of @xmath14-field and study the resulting power spectrum of the curvature perturbation after preheating for various cases of @xmath57 .    at the linear stage of preheating ,",
    "@xmath14-field which corresponds to the isocurvature perturbation @xcite grows exponentially by parametric resonance ( @xmath13-field fluctuations also grow but its growth rate is much smaller than that of @xmath14-field.@xcite ) eventually non - linear interactions of fields dominate the dynamics .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate curvature perturbations , we use the @xmath2 formalism instead of solving the perturbation equations .      in the two - field preheating model in which the effective potential is given by eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) , the homogeneous background equations are @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the energy density of the radiation .",
    "we have included the radiation fluid in order to realize the radiation dominated universe after preheating .",
    "@xmath60 is a decay rate from scalar fields to the radiation .",
    "we assume that both the decay rates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the radiation are the same for simplicity .",

    "the parameters used in the simulations are @xmath67 .        from both plots , we find that the @xmath31-folding number @xmath61 is very sensitive to @xmath64 .",
    "this feature is also seen in @xcite though the sample size is limited to @xmath65 and the parameters such as decay rate @xmath60 are different from those used in our simulations .",
    "hence we expect that this feature is characteristic of preheating itself .",
    "we have increased the sample size to @xmath68 ( we can not show the plot in this case because the file size becomes too large . ) and found similar feature to the case of the smaller sample size .",
    "this sensitive fluctuations of @xmath61 can be interpreted in a following way @xcite .",
    "neglecting the radiation to which both @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay for simplicity , the total energy density is given by @xmath69 , and the evolution equation of @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 labels @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the oscillating phase after inflation ,",
    "the second and third terms oscillate .",
    "if the period of these oscillations are much smaller than the hubble time , the averaged energy density over the period will decay in proportion to @xmath73 , like the radiation energy density .",
    "in such a case , the evolution of the universe can be described by only one parameter , such as a radiation energy density , and the isocurvature perturbations do not arise .",
    "hence additional curvature perturbations are not generated during preheating on super - horizon scales .",

    ", the behavior of @xmath74 is quite sensitive to the tiny difference of @xmath64 .",
    "we found that when the background trajectory is trapped in the potential valley along @xmath75 , which is seen remarkably in the right panel , the time interval between two zeros of @xmath74 becomes so long that it is smaller than the hubble time only by a factor .",

    "@xmath181 remains almost constant except for the region of small @xmath173 where the slope becomes steep due to the small size of the sampling number and the region where @xmath186 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath181 is a monotonically decreasing function in the bottom left panel and monotonically increasing function in the bottom right panel .",
    "later , we will give a qualitative explanation why these plots depend on @xmath174 .",
    "now let us consider what type of the power spectrum we can obtain from the numerical results above . since @xmath173 is an increasing function with respect to @xmath102 , going to larger scales means increasing @xmath173 . from eq .",
    "( [ tilt2 ] ) , the horizontal axis of all the panels in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] is @xmath187 hence if we increase the scale of interest @xmath102 by a factor of 10 , then the corresponding point on the horizontal axis shifts by @xmath188 .",
    "since cosmologically interesting scales range from @xmath189 to @xmath190 , the corresponding range in the horizontal axis , which we denote as @xmath191 , is @xmath192 . from eq .",
    "( [ tilt5 ] ) , the amplitude of @xmath165 is determined by multiplying @xmath181 by @xmath193 .",
    "therefore by choosing suitable @xmath194 , we can set @xmath165 to @xmath195 corresponding to the cobe normalization .",
    "for example , if @xmath196 , which corresponds to the case of the top right panel , @xmath181 is about @xmath197 in the range @xmath198 . hence if @xmath199 , then @xmath165 becomes @xmath200 , which corresponds to the cobe normalization . in this case , we have also @xmath201 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath147 has a value so that the horizon scale @xmath202 corresponds to @xmath203 , then @xmath191 lies in the range @xmath198 , in which case @xmath165 becomes scale invariant over the cosmological scales .    in the same way as above , for the bottom right panel , if @xmath204 , then @xmath165 gives the cobe normalization . in this case ,",
    "because @xmath165 changes little in this interval , the spectrum becomes almost scale invariant over the cosmological scales .",
    "for the bottom left panel , if we choose @xmath206 so that @xmath165 gives the cobe normalization , @xmath165 becomes too blue over the cosmological scales and hence this case is excluded .    from fig .",
    "[ sigma ] , we see that there is a tendency that the spectrum of the curvature perturbation becomes blue as @xmath174 decreases .",
    "this can be explained if we assume that @xmath88 becomes more random as @xmath174 becomes smaller , because the power spectrum of the completely randomized field is extremely blue as mentioned before @xcite . in our numerical calculation , we devided the range @xmath207 in @xmath64 space into ten bins and took the average of @xmath88 for each bin ( cf .",
    "see the fig .",
    "[ ten - bin ] ) .",
    "then we verified that the deviation of fluctuation of averaged @xmath88 in each bin from the statistical fluctuation becomes smaller as @xmath174 becomes smaller .",
    "this result shows that the assumption above is valid .",
    "it seems unnatural that both the amplitude and the spectral index of @xmath165 depend on the size of the box @xmath147 within which stochastic properties are defined .",
    "introducing the infrared cutoff @xmath147 is necessary , because without such a cutoff the expectation value of @xmath208 diverges .",
    "we have assumed throughout the paper that the mean value of @xmath14 vanishes in the box .",
    "let us now prepare a box whose size is much smaller than @xmath147 but is still larger than the scales of interest inside the box of size @xmath147 .",
    "then the average of @xmath14 inside the small box does not vanish in general . as shown in @xcite , statistical quantity such as power spectrum defined in the small box",
    "is not the same as the one defined in the large box of size @xmath147 .",
    "it is only when one averages over the small boxes inside the larger box of size @xmath147 that the statistical quantities become the same as the one defined in the large box .",
    "hence @xmath147 , the size of the box within which the average of @xmath14 vanishes , appears as a parameter which in this case controls the shape of @xmath165 .",
    "testing non - gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations has become one of the most powerful probe that distinguishes various inflationary and post - inflationary models @xcite .",
    "recently the level of non - gaussianity generated during preheating was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite consider the same preheating model as in this paper .",
    "however in @xcite , the primordial curvature perturbations are assumed to be generated during inflation while second order fluctuations which are responsible for the large non - gaussianity are amplified during preheating . though it is shown in @xcite that massless preheating model considered in this paper",
    "is already ruled out from observations due to large non - gaussianity , we have to reanalyze the problem because the mechanism of generating the primordial curvature perturbations in @xcite is completely different from that in our paper .",
    "we are now investigating the level of non - gaussianity generated during preheating by using the @xmath2 formalism .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics of preheating is completely determined by @xmath183 , not by @xmath209 and @xmath210 independently .",
    "all numerical results shown above is obtained for any value of @xmath209 if we assume @xmath1 . since @xmath209 determines the energy scale of inflation , @xmath209 fixes the amplitudes of the primordial gravitational waves produced during inflation . on the other hand , as we have shown above , if the isocurvature perturbations on super - horizon scales are amplified at the end of inflation with suitable negative spectral index and infrared cutoff , the primordial curvature perturbations with almost scale invariant and @xmath211 amplitude can be generated during preheating .",
    "hence we can lower the tensor to scalar ratio by lowering @xmath209 , that is , the energy scale of inflation . in this case ,",
    "@xmath212 inflation model , which is ruled out from the wmap three year results combined with sdss @xcite , comes into the observationally allowed region . lowering the tensor to scalar ratio in the chaotic inflationary scenario",
    "was also considered in @xcite(see also @xcite ) , though the mechanism is completely different from the one in this paper .    for completeness",
    ", we consider the case in which the power spectrum of @xmath14 at the end of inflation is blue , that is , @xmath213 . in this case , eq .  ( [ rel10 ] ) can be approximated as @xmath214 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{rel12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath215 is much smaller than unity , right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rel12 ] ) is suppressed .",
    "hence the generation of curvature perturbations on large scales does not occur in this case . in the scale - invariant case ,",
    "that is , @xmath216 , we have no appropriate approximation in order to reduce eq .",
    "( [ rel10 ] ) to a simpler form .",
    "so , in this case , we have to calculate eq .",
    "( [ rel10 ] ) directly .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to examine whether the generation of the curvature perturbations occurs or not during preheating and , if it occurs , whether they could be seeds for large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "to do so , we applied @xmath2 formalism to two - field preheating model whose potential is given by @xmath217 .",
    "then we have analyzed the dependence of the @xmath31-folding number during preheating on the isocurvature perturbations at the end of inflation which corresponds to perturbations of @xmath14-field .",
    "we verified that the @xmath31-folding number during preheating is very sensitive to the initial value of @xmath14 due to the chaotic nature of the background trajectory in field space , which has been already observed in @xcite .",
    "though the @xmath31-folding number seems almost random as a function of @xmath218 , we found that the fluctuation of the smoothed @xmath31-folding number over a large number of initial values of @xmath14 exceeds the statistical fluctuation .",
    "hence the @xmath31-folding number is not completely randomized .",
    "this deviation of the smoothed @xmath31-folding number from the statistical fluctuation provides the generation of curvature perturbations on large scales .",
    "we numerically found that the amplitude and the spectral index of the curvature perturbations originating from preheating at current cosmological scales can be fixed to the observed values by tuning the spectral index of @xmath14-field and the infrared cutoff .",
    "an interesting point is that this consequence is derived only from the requirement @xmath1 .",
    "hence by lowering @xmath209 which determines the energy scale of inflation , we can lower the tensor to scalar ratio to the observationally allowed value .",
