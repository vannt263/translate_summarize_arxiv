    "the @xmath115-dependence ( @xmath116 ) of the intensities of these peaks ( strong at smaller-@xmath115 or at larger @xmath40-spacing ) confirms that they are due to the long range magnetic ordering of the eu / fe - moment .",

    "we carried out symmetry analysis using sarah program @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , the symmetry analysis for the fe moment ordering yielded that only four irs enter the magnetic decomposition , two of which are one - dimensional representations ( labelled @xmath128 and @xmath132 ) and remaining two are two - dimensional representations ( @xmath129 and @xmath133 ) in the little group .",

    "the fit gave more intensity for 5.94    peak than the observed one , while the calculated intensity of the 3.73    peak was almost half of the observed intensity .",
    "this indicated that ir @xmath129 does not provide the correct representation for our data .",
    "next we tried fitting our data based on ir @xmath128 , which has one basis function .",
    "this basis function gives fm alignment of both eu and fe moment along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "first we allowed to vary both eu and fe moment and we obtained a reasonably good fit to the data with moment on eu [ @xmath135 and fe [ @xmath136 at 1.8  k with magnetic bragg factor 12.6% . in the second state of refinement we kept fe moment",
    "fixed to zero and only varied eu moment .",
    "a good fit of the 1.8  k nd data was obtained for eu moment of @xmath9 with magnetic bragg factor 12.5% .",
    "though the magnetic bragg factor is nearly the same with and without fe moment fit , the large error bar on the fe moment which is @xmath137% of the observed fe moment value of @xmath138 may suggest that this is not a good solution and the fe moment can be set to zero .",
    "the zero value of fe moment was also observed in our mssbauer study @xcite , which supports our analysis with fixing fe moment to zero . the refinement of magnetic bragg peaks at 1.8  k within ir @xmath128 is shown in fig .  [ fig : nd1](c ) .",
    "the magnetic structure of eu(fe@xmath1ir@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 determined this way consists of ferromagnetically coupled eu moments aligned along the @xmath10-axis and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_struct ] .",
    "the ordered moment @xmath9 obtained from the refinement of 1.8  k neutron diffraction is somewhat smaller than the theoretically expected value of @xmath139 for eu@xmath5 ( @xmath14 ) ions .",
    "an ordered moment of @xmath140 was found from neutron diffraction study on eufe@xmath21(as@xmath37p@xmath38)@xmath21 @xcite",
    "the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in eu(fe@xmath1ir@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 has been investigated by microscopic tools of @xmath0sr and neutron powder diffraction , and magnetic structure was determined .",
    "our @xmath0sr data confirmed the long range magnetic ordering below @xmath7  k and the magnetic ground state was found to be ferromagnetic in nature .",
    "the magnetic structure determination from neutron diffraction further confirmed the ferromagnetic structure showing that ferromagnetically coupled eu moments are aligned along the @xmath10-axis with a magnetic propagation wavevector * k * = ( 0,0,0 ) and ordered moment of @xmath141 at 1.8  k. thus both @xmath0sr and neutron diffraction indicate ferromagnetic ordering in eu(fe@xmath1ir@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 which coexists with superconductivity as inferred from the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements .",
    "as proposed earlier for the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in eu(fe@xmath47ru@xmath48)@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite and eufe@xmath21(as@xmath35p@xmath36)@xmath21 @xcite , the ferromagnetic superconductivity in the present compound may also be ascribed to the formation of spontaneous - vortex phase .",
    "further investigations are desired to understand the mechanism of coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity in these ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "it is seen that while substitution of fe by co , ru and ir leads to superconductivity , no superconductivity is observed in ni - doped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "this contrasts the ni doping in bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 which also induces superconductivity and breaks the intuitive analogy between the doping behavior of eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 and bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "an obvious question is : is it the ferromagnetic order of eu@xmath5 moments which is responsible for the absence of superconductivity in eu(fe@xmath19ni@xmath20)@xmath21as@xmath21 ?",
    "a comparative study of superconducting co- , ru- and ir - doped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 and nonsuperconducting ni - doped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 should prove informative in understanding the difference of the superconducting behaviors of these two groups of ferromagnetically ordered compounds and enrich our knowledge of the conditions to realize the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "further , it appears that the substitution at fe or as sites stabilizes the @xmath17-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction of undoped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 and the direction of eu@xmath5 moments also changes from the @xmath17-plane orientation to along the @xmath10-axis in doped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "the change in magnetic structure upon doping the fe or as sites is most likely brought by the change in rkky interaction which is mediated by the conduction electrons from the feas layers .",
    "if this is the case one would expect the nature of magnetic order to remain unchanged upon doping at eu site or upon the application of pressure as the feas layers remain intact .",
    "it would be of interest to check this hypothesis by magnetic structure determination of eu site doped eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 and in the pressure induced superconducting state for which the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity is more intuitive .",
