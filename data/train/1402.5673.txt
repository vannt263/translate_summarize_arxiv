    "the dynamics of a two - state quantum system resulting from the action of a resonant external pulse of precise temporal area is a classical example in quantum mechanics .",
    "this simple two - state quantum system has an interesting theoretical extension , from a nondegenerate two - level quantum system ( where only two two quantum states /ground and excited/ are available ) , to one with a degenerate ground level and a degenerate excited level .",
    "these physical systems can be found at isolated atoms and molecules , where the states of well defined angular momentum j , due to the rotational symmetry produces a degeneracy of 2j+1 magnetic sublevels . for correct description of laser - induced transitions between quantum states with defined angular momentum , one must also incorporate several magnetic sublevels ( labeled by m ) , that may serve as a possible initial states .",
    "hence each of these magnetic sublevels have a laser - driven excitation dynamic into to set of excited magnetic sublevels .",
    "other source of multilevel systems can be the systems , whose mathematical description uses the usual rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . within the rwa the degeneracies can also be found for more general multistate quantum systems .    to handle such multilevel systems , in 1983 morris and shore have introduced a coordinate transformation with the general property that could factorize the dynamic of any two degenerate sets of quantum states , to an equivalent description involving only independent uncoupled pairs of equations . generally , the morris - shore ( ms ) transformation is able to reduces the coherent quantum dynamics of a coupled degenerate two - level system to a set of independent nondegenerate two - state systems and a set of uncoupled states .",
    "the mathematical description of ms transformation only requires deriving of eigenvalues and the eigenstates of a hermitean matrix , which is a product of interaction matrices .",
    "the eigenstates of this hermitean matrix are the ms states , that represent the independent two - state systems and the dark states .",
    "the eigenvalues represent the ms interactions in the independent ms two - state systems .",
    "the ms transformation is quite general , but requires that all initial interactions are constant , or share the same time dependence , and also that all interactions are resonant , or equally detuned from the upper states .",
    "the condition of equally detuned set of states implies that the lower set of states is degenerate in rwa sense , and so is the upper set of states .",
    "having explain the constrains of ms transformation , it is natural to ask whether they can be relaxed .",
    "it turns out that within the framework of weak deviation of equally detuned set of statrs , perturbative solution can be derived .",

    "ii we review the two - level ms transformation and in details define the problem for its extension . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the perturbative solution to the problem of generalized ms transformation .",

    "some elements concerning the general solution of the ms transformation will be also discussed .",
