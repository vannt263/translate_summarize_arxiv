    "the quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the mott insulator phase of cold dilute gas of boson atoms in an optical lattice was widely studied both theoretically @xcite , and experimentally @xcite .",

    "the geometry and the depth of the optical lattice potential are easily controlled by the laser field .",
    "the cold atoms loaded on the optical lattice realize the bose - hubbard model @xcite , which predicts the phase transition from the superfluid into the mott insulator phase , by increasing the optical potential depth .",
    "the atoms are confined in an array of microscopic trapping potentials due to the optical dipole force , and by changing the relevant parameters , the optical lattice can be filled with few atoms down to one atom per site @xcite .",
    "optical lattices allow us to go beyond the weakly interacting regime of bose gas into strongly correlated systems of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the cold atoms in an optical lattice , in the mott insulator phase with one atom per site , can be considered as an artificial crystal .",
    "such artificial crystals are similar to noble atom and molecular crystals , as each atom retains his identity , and negligible overlaps exist between the atom electronic wave functions at different sites",
    ". it will be of big importance to check the possibility of the appearance of solid state effects and processes in such artificial crystals .",
    "for example in molecular crystals , an electronic excitation localized on a molecule can transfer among the crystal molecules due to electrostatic interactions , i.e. dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "namely , an excited molecule will decay to the ground state and other molecule will be excited , without a charge transfer between the molecules . in using the crystal symmetry ,",
    "such energy transfer can be represented in the quasi - momentum space by a wave that propagates in the crystal .",
    "we obtain quasi - particles with an effective mass and a finite life time , which are called excitons @xcite .",
    "if the molecular crystal is located within a cavity , the excitons and the cavity photons are coupled . in the strong coupling regime , where the exciton and photon line - widths are smaller than the coupling strength , the excitons and photons are coherently mixed to form new system quasi - particles which are called cavity - polaritons @xcite .",
    "we get two polariton branches which are separated by the rabi splitting energy . coherent interactions of laser pulses in a resonant optically dense medium of two - level atoms was presented in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate such excitons and polaritons .",
    "we consider two - level atoms within a cavity , with transition energies close to resonance with a cavity mode .",
    "the optical lattice potentials are chosen to give light shifts in - phase for the ground and excited states , with minimums at the same positions . in multilevel atoms and for a specific laser frequency one can achieve an excited level with light shifts in - phase with the ground state ones , and there even exists a magic frequency where we get equal shifts as in the ground state @xcite .",
    "in all the discussions the trapping fields are considered classical and far from resonance with any of the atom electronic transitions .",
    "furthermore , we limit the treatment to the mott insulator phase with one atom per site @xcite .",
    "we examine the possibility of the appearance of excitons in such a system , by comparing between the energy transfer coupling parameter induced by the dipole - dipole resonance interaction , and the excited state line width . in a cavity",
    "the view is different , now the excitons are strongly coupled to the cavity photons by the dipole interaction .",
    "hence , coherent polariton states can be observed which are superpositions of excitons and cavity photons . in paper @xcite ,",
    "the cavity photons are also treated quantum mechanically , but their energies are far to resonance with any of the atom transitions , and they are used to produce the optical lattice .",
    "moreover , we get the linear optical spectra of the cavity for an incident external field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "the conclusions are presented in section 6 . in the appendix",
    "the linear optical spectra are derived using the input - output formalism .",
    "we consider neutral cold two - level atoms where the cavity mode is close to resonance with only a single excited state .",
    "the cold atoms are trapped on @xmath1 standing laser waves far to resonance with any of the atomic excitations , and result in shifts in the ground and excited states .",
    "such shifts correspond to an optical lattice potential @xmath2 for ground state atoms , and @xmath3 for excited state atoms , where @xmath4 is the atom location .",
    "the potentials are periodic with a periodicity of , @xmath0 , half laser wave length .",
    "the potentials are in general out of phase , and for two - level atoms they have @xmath5 phase shift , where the position of the minimum of one potential appears at the maximum of the other . even though , we assume the two optical lattice potentials to be in - phase , with minimums located at the same position .",
    "such assumption is possible as for multi - level atoms , i.e. alkali or alkaline atoms , one get a number of optical lattices , one for each level . for a specific laser magic frequency and polarization",

    "the higher nearest neighbor transfer interaction terms are much smaller than the free atom line width , and they are not relevant for the exciton formation , and hence can be neglected here .    in the next section",
    "we show how in using a cavity one can observe better coherent effects involving cavity photons , where the excitation transfer is mediated by the cavity photons , in the strong coupling regime , where the excitation - photon coupling is larger than the atomic and cavity - photon line widths .",
    "let us now consider such a quantum gas of ultracold atoms enclosed in the middle of optical resonator built of two parallel mirrors , which we consider as perfect for the moment ( see figure ( 3 ) ) .",

    "the atom position dependence disappears due to the lattice translational symmetry , and the lattice symmetry ensures that only coupling between excitons and photons with the same in - plane wave vector occurs , i.e. we have quasi - momentum conservation .",
    "the coupled exciton - photon hamiltonian is written as @xmath111    due to exciton - photon coupling the exciton and the photon coherently mix and it makes sense to transform to a diagonal basis with respect to this coupling , namely the polariton basis @xcite .",
    "the maximal coupling appears at small wave vectors as the exciton band width is narrow relative to the photon band and the exciton effective mass thus is much larger than the cavity photon effective mass",
    ". therefore the exciton dispersion around the exciton - photon coupling can be neglected , and one can use @xmath112 .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized to give @xmath113 which exhibits two diagonal polariton branches with different dispersions @xmath114 where @xmath115 and we defined the exciton - photon detuning by @xmath116 .",

    "the phase transition is stimulated by the nonlinear polariton - polariton interactions originated of the atom saturations .",
    "the relaxation towards @xmath58 is induced mainly by polariton - polariton interactions and to some extend by the emission of on - site vibrational quanta , which corresponds to localized atomic excitation to a higher bloch band .",
    "as we neglect direct atomic tunneling such on - site excitations are dispersion - less , so that no bottle - neck effect exists in the present system . in semiconductor microcavities",
    "the main relaxation mechanism is due to the scattering of polaritons by acoustic - phonons and as the lower polariton branch slope around the exciton - photon intersection point is larger than the sound velocity in semiconductor crystals , the polaritons are stuck near this momentum in a so called bottle - neck effect @xcite .",
    "this effect is considered as one of the main obstacles for achieving a bec of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities @xcite .",

    "one alternative would be the use of long lived ( metastable ) atomic states and very high finesse mirrors .",
    "up to now we considered an ideal cavity with perfect mirrors . but in order to observe the system eigenmodes , we need to couple the internal cavity modes to the external world .",
    "we do this in using the standard input output formalism or quasi - mode approach @xcite , which is well proved for high - q cavities . in this approach",
    "the internal cavity field modes and the external free radiation field are quantized separately and weakly coupled via the cavity mirrors .",
    "this leads to the cavity field damping ( photon loss ) but also allows to consistently calculate the relation between the cavity input and output fields . to include atomic spontaneous emission as an energy loss term we add an effective exciton damping phenomenologically",
    "this finally allows to calculate the transmission @xmath138 , reflection @xmath139 , and absorption @xmath140 spectra for a given incident field as shown in figure ( 3 ) .",

    ". the peaks of the transmission and the absorption , and the dips of the reflection correspond to the two polariton branches , which are the real eigenmodes of the system . from the plots we conclude that large absorption is obtained for polaritons which are much more excitonic than photonic .",
    "high transmission peaks and deep reflection dips are obtained for polaritons which are much more photonic than excitonic . at zero wave vector , as the polariton is half exciton and half photon , the upper and the lower spectra are identical . as the wave vector increase the upper branch becomes more photonic than excitonic , and the opposite for the lower one .",
    "hence , the line - width of the upper branch spectrum becomes wider , which equals the cavity line - width , and the lower one becomes narrower , which equals the atom line - width . as the absorption is of the atomic excitations , at large wave vectors absorption only of the lower branch exists .",

    "<S> excitons in these artificial crystals are similar to frenkel excitons in noble atom or molecular crystals . </S>",
    "<S> they appear when the atomic excited state line width is smaller than the exciton band width generated by dipole - dipole coupling . </S>",
    "<S> when the atoms are placed within a cavity the electronic excitations and the quantized cavity mode get coupled . in the collective strong coupling regime excitations </S>",
    "<S> form two branches of cavity polaritons with rabi splitting larger than the atomic and the cavity line width . to demonstrate their properties we calculate the transmission , reflection , and absorption spectra for an incident weak probe field , which show resonances at the polariton frequencies . </S>"
