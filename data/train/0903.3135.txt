    "we first briefly and loosely describe the triangle - duality approach , in the context of bond percolation , with a slightly different perspective : we consider constructing a lattice graph rather than decomposing one .",

    ", we discuss conditions which allow a valid exact solution for the bond percolation threshold in the framework of 3-regular hypergraphs . here",
    "we only note some remarks and cautions regarding a few issues .",
    "( 1 ) planarity and graph duality play crucial roles in our reasoning , as in all rigorous solutions for bond percolation thresholds of periodic lattices .",
    "our results only directly apply to planar hypergraphs and planar generators .",
    "there is some evidence of wider applicability , which is being investigated .",
    "( 2 ) care must be taken when constructing the dual hypergraph , with the reversed triangles connected in a precise manner in order to create a proper dual structure .",
    "the reversed triangles need not be the same size or shape as the original triangles , but may need to be distorted instead of merely reversed .",
    "( 3 ) in order to prove that the solution is valid , the resulting lattice graph must be periodic . while it is plausible that the results hold for aperiodic models ,",
    "there is currently no rigorous proof that such solutions are valid .      for lattices constructed by this method",
    ", the value of the bond percolation threshold is determined by equations describing the probabilities of connections within the generator .",
    "therefore , using the same generator in multiple self - dual triangular arrangements produces multiple lattices with equal bond percolation thresholds .",
    "ziff and scullard @xcite(figures 1 and 6 ) illustrate three different self - dual arrangements . in section [ equality - section ] , we show that there are infinitely many self - dual 3-uniform hypergraphs , so each generator satisfying the appropriate conditions will generate an infinite set of lattices with equal percolation thresholds .",
    "previously , it was only known that there were infinitely many lattices with bond percolation threshold equal to one - half , since wierman @xcite provided a construction for infinitely many periodic self - dual lattices .",
    "we also construct a sequence of nested generators which must give unequal percolation thresholds , which implies that there are infinitely many values @xmath1 for which there are infinitely many lattices with bond percolation threshold equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the result also holds for site percolation thresholds , by the bond - to - site transformation .",
    "given a set @xmath13 of vertices , a hyperedge @xmath14 is a subset of @xmath13 .",
    "a hyperedge @xmath14 is said to be incident to each of its vertices .",
    "a @xmath15-hyperedge is a hyperedge containing exactly @xmath15 vertices . in order to neglect the detailed structure of our generators , at times",

    "a hypergraph containing only @xmath15-hyperedges is a @xmath15-uniform hypergraph .",

    "therefore , we have established that for infinitely many real numbers @xmath1 there are infinitely many periodic lattice graphs with bond percolation threshold equal to @xmath1 .",
    "recall that by fisher s @xcite bond - to - site transformation , the bond percolation model on a lattice @xmath54 is equivalent to the site percolation model on the covering lattice ( in the physics literature ) or line graph ( in the mathematical literature ) , so that their percolation thresholds are equal .",

    "these conditions are naturally stated in terms of planar hypergraphs , reflect the need for planarity of the lattice in order to apply graph duality results , and reflect the need for technical conditions for validity of the mathematical proofs .    in particular , note that sufficient conditions reflect the current state of knowledge in mathematical percolation theory , requiring periodicity and an axis of symmetry .",
    "it is plausible that the results may be valid in a larger context , where these conditions are relaxed .",
    "as evidence for this , in a recent breakthrough , bollobs and riordan @xcite exactly determined the site percolation threshold in a certain continuum percolation model which is not periodic or symmetric .",
    "ziff and scullard also apply their approach to site percolation models and correlated percolation models ( either all open or all closed ) .",
    "the formalism allows correlated bonds within each generator . as in the case of bond percolation",
