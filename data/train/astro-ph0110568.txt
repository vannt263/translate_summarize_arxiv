    "butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) were the first to establish a rapid decline in the star formation rate in rich clusters of galaxies since z  @xmath1  0.5 , when they discovered a significant increase of the blue galaxy fraction with increasing redshift , from about 3% in nearby clusters , to 25% in clusters at z  @xmath1  0.5 .",
    "in addition , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images have shown that the fraction of spirals , as well as interacting or merging galaxies , increases with redshift , and that the increase in the spiral population towards higher redshift corresponds to a decrease in the s0 population ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; fasano et al .",
    "given that both gas removal , leading to globally truncated star formation ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , and starburst - provoking ( through various tidal perturbation scenarios , e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1996 ; bekki 1999 ) mechanisms are almost certainly operating in the rich cluster environment , it is a non - trivial matter to disentangle which mechanism primarily dominates galaxy evolution in various cluster environments .",
    "the situation is further exacerbated by the fact that , except for immediately ( e.g. , @xmath30.5 gyr ) after a burst of star formation , which produces extremely blue colors and strong balmer absorption lines , a fading starburst and a fading , truncated disk are basically impossible to distinguish from global colors and spectroscopy ( e.g. , newberry , boroson , & kirshner 1990 ) .",
    "consequently , there has been considerable disagreement over the interpretation of the strong balmer line galaxies in z  @xmath4  0.5 clusters , originally discovered by dressler & gunn ( 1983 ) , as to whether they represent post - starburst galaxies ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; barger et al . 1996 ; dressler et al .",

    "1999 ) , or galaxies with globally truncated star formation ( e.g. , balogh et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these issues are more extensively summarized in rose et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and here we simply restate two key , related questions which need to be answered : ( 1 ) what form does the rapid cluster galaxy evolution take : is it predominantly driven by gas removal ( balogh et al .",
    "1999 ) or a final burst of star formation ( e.g. , dressler et al . 1999",
    "; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ( 2 ) what is the mechanism for the evolution : ram - pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ; abadi , moore , & bower 1999 ) or tidal perturbations ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1996 ; bekki 1999 ) ?    as is discussed in rose et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , ram pressure stripping of gas in galaxies is expected to lead to a roughly uniform truncation of star formation across the disk , while tidal mechanisms produce centralized bursts of star formation ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "consequently , observing the spatial distribution of the last star formation in galaxies can provide key evidence regarding the method through which the star formation has been extinguished . in rose et",
    "2001 ) recent star formation was investigated in a number of early - type galaxies in nearby clusters , and it was concluded that this star formation is centralized .",
    "the evidence for centralized star formation is based on the spatial distribution of emission lines in the cases where star formation is still ongoing , and on the radial color profiles in the cases where star formation has been recently terminated .",
    "consequently , it is of interest to assess the situation in clusters at higher redshift , where the ongoing star formation activity is at a substantially higher level .",
    "recently , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter vd98 ) completed an extensive study of the z  @xmath2  0.33 cluster cl1358 + 62 , and have published radial color profiles for several galaxies , including a few in which a blue nuclear region is evident . based on these results , we have used the archival _ hst _ imaging data for cl1358 + 62 , in conjunction with spectroscopic information published in fisher et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter f98 ) , to assess whether the cluster galaxies which show evidence of recently terminated star formation also have centrally concentrated blue colors .    in section  2 , the spectroscopic and imaging data are summarized , as well as the definitions of two galaxy samples , a `` normal '' sample and a `` k+a '' sample , the latter consisting of galaxies with spectroscopic evidence of recently concluded star formation .",
    "in addition , the analysis techniques for obtaining radial color profiles are discussed . in section  3 ,",
    "a statistical comparison of the radial color profiles for the two galaxy samples is given , to test whether the k+a sample on average shows bluer central colors than the control sample . in section  4 , we discuss our results within the context of the question of whether tidal perturbations or ram pressure stripping have had a greater effect on the evolution of galaxies in clusters . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that = 70 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath6  =  0.15 .",
    "the imaging used for this paper was collected from the _ hubble space telescope _ archive , and was combined with spectroscopic data obtained from the literature , for the purpose of observing the spatial distribution of recent star formation within cluster galaxies .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "archive has been searched for galaxy clusters of moderate ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) redshift that have been imaged in at least two passbands , using the wfpc2 instrument .",
    "our search resulted in a sample of four clusters : abell 2390 at z  @xmath2  0.23 , cl1358 + 62 at z  @xmath2  0.33 , cl0303 + 17 at z  @xmath2  0.42 , and cl0016 + 16 at z  @xmath2  0.55 .",
    "the literature on each cluster was then researched for spectroscopic information .",
    "the specific information we require is balmer line strengths and [ oii]@xmath83727 emission line strengths , which are indicative of the levels of recent ( e.g. , within the past few gyr ) and current ( e.g. , ongoing ) star formation .    in this paper , only cl1358 + 62 is discussed , as the other three clusters were discarded for various reasons .",
    "first , they all had very limited sky coverage when compared to cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the images of abell 2390 did not include any of the galaxies that had been classified spectroscopically as having recently concluded star formation ; in addition , only one exposure was taken at each pointing , making removal of cosmic rays difficult . both of the remaining clusters",
    "were not included in the final analysis , due to the fact that they had small samples of galaxies with low signal - to - noise data , which did not make them suitable for statistical analyses .",
    "cl1358 + 62 , on the other hand , was imaged in a mosaic over a large area , and had more than one exposure at each pointing , greatly facilitating cosmic ray removal .",
    "cl1358 + 62 is a rich , moderate - redshift cluster , which is also x - ray luminous ( l@xmath9  @xmath2  7x10@xmath10  ergs / s at 0.2    4.5 kev ) ( fabricant , mcclintock , & bautz 1991 ) .",
    "the presence of a pervasive hot intracluster medium along with the high velocity dispersion of the galaxies ( @xmath11=1037  km  s@xmath5 ; f98 ) ensures that ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium in galaxies should play an important role in the evolution of galaxies passing near the cluster center . f98",

    "we have divided many of the member galaxies in cl1358 + 62 into two samples , based on their spectroscopic features as given in f98 .",
    "one is a control sample , consisting of galaxies with normal spectra for old stellar populations , e.g. , no emission and weak balmer absorption lines .",
    "the second sample consists of galaxies with low emission and strong balmer absorption .",
    "originally known as e+a galaxies ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) , they are now commonly referred to as `` k+a '' or `` k+a / a+k '' ( franx 1993 ; dressler et al . 1999 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ) , hence we adopt the k+a terminology .",
    "specifically , for the k+a sample , the average of the three balmer lines ( @xmath3h@xmath15 ) is required to have an equivalent width of at least 3 , and the emission strength is limited to less than 5 .",
    "the normal sample is defined to have a limit of 1.5  in @xmath3h@xmath15 , and the [ oii ] line was restricted to lie between 5  and 5 .",
    "f98 define normal and post - starburst galaxies slightly differently .",
    "our definitions make the limits more stringent for the normal red absorption - line galaxy population , and slightly increase the number of galaxies classified as k+a .",
    "our characterization of k+a galaxies using @xmath3h@xmath15 ( following f98 ) differs from the characterization of dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who used solely h@xmath14 to define their k+a / a+k galaxies . despite the difference in these criteria",
    ", we have found that the h@xmath14 cut - off of our k+a sample is virtually identical to the 3  equivalent width h@xmath14 cut - off for k+a galaxies used by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( only three of our 24 k+a galaxies have h@xmath14  @xmath3  3 ) .",
    "our final samples include 24 k+a galaxies , and 46 normal galaxies .",
    "we have defined the samples so that there is a gap between them , to account for leakage through the large error bars . given the rather large error bars in balmer line and [ oii ] equivalent widths",
    ", there may be some leakage of galaxies from one sample into another , which would tend to weaken any intrinsic differences that we observe between the two samples .",
    "[ oii ] illustrates where the two samples fall on an [ oii ] emission vs. @xmath3h@xmath15 absorption plot , and shows typical error bars for the galaxies in the two samples as given in f98 .",
    "there are some galaxies that fit within our limits but were excluded from the two final samples either because they were very close to the edge of a frame or a nearby neighbor or they could not be located on the images .",
    "we did not use any morphological criteria when originally defining our samples .",
    "however , vd98 have listed morphological types for the galaxies in the cluster , and the vast majority included in our samples ( nearly 75% in the k+a group , and approximately 90% in the normal group ) are type e , e / s0 , or , more commonly , s0",
    ". the rest they have assigned `` ? '' morphologies , and one is classified as an irregular .",
    "three unique cases having peculiar morphologies will be discussed in more detail in section  3 .",
    "surface photometry of the galaxies in the normal and k+a samples has been carried out using the wfpc2 images from the _ hst _ archive , which are fully described in vd98 .",
    "vd98 imaged the cluster at 12 different positions in two filters ( f606w at 5957  and f814w at 7940 ) , creating a mosaic with a total area covering 49 arcmin@xmath16 .",
    "three 1200s exposures were taken at each position , for each filter .",
    "image analysis has been carried out using the iraf package .",
    "the first step is to combine the images at each position to remove cosmic rays , using the ` imcombine ' routine .",
    "cosmic rays near a galaxy can also be removed via the ` imedit ' task .",
    "a general sky - subtraction is accomplished by statistically computing the average sky value in an area void of galaxies , and subtracting that value from the entire image . vd98",
    "have described large - scale diagonal bands in the background of some of the images , produced by light scattered off the optical telescope assembly .",
    "we avoided attempting surface photometry for any galaxies which are located in an area whose background varies too greatly because of this effect .",
    "we have located each of the galaxies in the two samples , using the x and y offset coordinates from the cluster center as given in table  1 of f98.58@xmath1721@xmath180 and dec=62@xmath1945@xmath2037@xmath21 , b1950 , instead of the central coordinates given in f98 . ] to construct the radial color profiles for each galaxy , the ` ellipse ' routine in iraf has been used .",
    "the ` ellipse ' task fits azimuthally  averaged elliptical isophotes to a galaxy as a function of its semi  major axis .",
    "the ` ellipse ' routine is run for each galaxy in both the f606w and f814w images . combining the f606w and f814w magnitude profiles results in a radial color profile of the galaxy .",

    "i color , and which , at z  @xmath2  0.33 , corresponds to a rest frame color between b  v and b ",
    "r ) versus the logarithm of the semi  major axis .",
    "the zero - point of the scale is arbitrary , and error bars are included in the profiles , which includes both statistical errors ( calculated for the magnitudes by ` ellipse ' from the scatter in the intensity profile of the fit ) and sky subtraction errors ( we estimate a 1% error in the sky background ) , which become important at large radii .    the differing point spread function for the f606w and f814w images proves to be a problem for the inner @xmath21.5 pixels . while we degraded the f814w frame to match the f606w frame ,",
    "the color profile is not reliable within that radius , hence we only consider each profile outside of @xmath21.5 pixels . for cl1358 + 62 , excluding 1.5 pixels corresponds to losing the inner 0.66  kpc of each galaxy . since k+a galaxies in nearby clusters are observed to have recent star formation typically extending through the central 2  kpc in radius ( caldwell et al .",
    "1996 ; caldwell , rose , & dendy 1999 ; rose et al .",
    "2001 ) , we might expect a similar radius for such activity in the z  @xmath2  0.3 galaxies . thus the inner cut - off , while producing a significant loss in the lever arm for measuring color gradients in the central regions , still allows for the detection of centralized star formation over the spatial scales expected from nearby examples .",
    "in addition , to keep a consistent comparison standard for the entire sample , the fit for each galaxy was restricted to a radius of 0.7@xmath21 ( @xmath27 pixels ) , which corresponds to roughly 3.1  kpc for cl1358 + 62 .",
    "this limit was chosen because it is large enough to encompass a centralized burst of the kind seen in nearby k+a galaxies , but small enough so as not to include a significant amount of area in which the sky subtraction becomes overly important .",

    "the radial color profiles have less of a red slope towards the center than typical e / s0 galaxies , in that bluer colors are more likely to appear in the central regions .",
    "there is some uncertainty as to whether this effect can be due to a systematic trend of color gradient with apparent magnitude .",
    "however , given the uncertainty in the observed trend in cl1358 + 62 , along with the fact that no such trend is observable among nearby galaxies , we conclude that the observed difference in the color gradients between normal and k+a galaxies in cl1358 + 62 is likely due to a real intrinsic difference in the two samples .",
    "there have been a number of studies investigating the issue of how star formation typically ends in cluster galaxies , e.g. , whether through sudden truncation of normal star formation , or through a starburst .",
    "we briefly summarize these previous studies here , then place our new result within that context .",
    "on the one hand , evidence exists that for many galaxies in rich clusters , rapid truncation of normal star formation is the principal evolutionary mechanism .",
    "for example , balogh et al . ( 1997 , 1998 ) concluded from a study of the equivalent widths of the [ oii]@xmath83727 emission line in cluster and field galaxies , that star formation is suppressed in the cluster relative to the field , indicating that galaxies lose their gas through truncation of star formation , not through a starburst .",
    "in addition , there is abundant evidence that spiral galaxies in nearby clusters are on average globally depleted in hi when compared to their field counterparts ( solanes et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) and that the sizes of the hi disks have been reduced ( cayatte et al . 1994 ) .",
    "ram pressure stripping is clearly the most plausible explanation for these observations .",
    "furthermore , several studies have provided direct evidence for spirals in the process of losing gas due to ram pressure stripping , in that displaced hi envelopes and/or bow shock morphologies in truncated h@xmath26 disks are observed ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1995 ; kenney & koopmann 1999 ; bravo - alfaro et al . 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations by abadi , moore , & bower ( 1999 ) indicate that ram pressure stripping can not be solely responsible for the observed rapid evolution of the star formation rate in cluster galaxies .",
    "in addition , while this mechanism does lead to stripping preferentially in the outer parts of a galaxy disk ( which may explain the group of virgo spirals found by cayatte et al .",
    "1994 to have centrally concentrated hi disks ) , even under the most favorable case of perpendicular infall the gas disk is _ not _ stripped down to within only @xmath42  kpc of the nucleus ( as indicated by the radial extent of observed blue nuclear regions in k+a galaxies ) . furthermore , imaging of clusters out to z  =  0.83 has revealed an enhanced level of tidally - interacting systems ( thompson 1988 ; lavery & henry 1988 ; lavery , pierce , & mcclure 1992 ; dressler et al . 1994 ; couch et al .",
    "1998 ; van dokkum et al . 1999 ) .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1999 ) and poggianti et al . ( 1999 ) have also seen evidence of tidal interactions in disk galaxies , and conclude that a burst of star formation is more likely in these cluster galaxies than a truncation of normal star formation .",
    "as well , studies of nearby clusters reveal examples of galaxies which have experienced centralized star formation episodes ( moss & whittle 1993 , 2000 ; caldwell et al . 1996 ; caldwell , rose , & dendy , 1999 ; rose et al .",
    "in particular , most of the z  @xmath2  0.05 k+a galaxies studied to date show strong color gradients indicating blue central regions .",
    "norton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have concluded , based on long - slit spectra of a sample of field e+a galaxies identified by zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , that the young stellar populations of these galaxies are more centrally concentrated than the old stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , zabludoff et al . (",
    "1996 ) found that many of their field e+a galaxies have peculiar or interacting morphologies , which they argue is due to galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "also , moss & whittle ( 1993 , 2000 ) find that early - type tidally - distorted spirals are often found with compact nuclear h@xmath26 emission , thus providing a direct link between tidal perturbation and centralized star formation .",
    "consequently , centralized star formation , probably induced by tidal disturbances , appears to play an important role in cluster evolution as well .    in our study",
    "we have found evidence for systematically different radial color gradients between galaxies in cl1358 + 62 classified ( on spectroscopic grounds ) as k+a and those classified as having normal older populations .",
    "the difference is in the sense that bluer nuclei ( relative to the surrounding area outside the central @xmath42  kpc ) prevail in the case of the k+a galaxies .",
    "we found this difference in spite of the fact that there could be some leakage between the two samples , due to the large error bars in the spectroscopic measurements , which would tend to blur the difference we find .",
    "the difference could be due to an apparent trend in the relationship between magnitude and color gradient , which greatly affects the statistical strength of our results .",
    "however , the absence of such an observed trend in nearby galaxies indicates that there is likely a real systematic difference between the two samples .",
    "our result is certainly compatible with a centralized episode of star formation that naturally occurs in various tidal interaction scenarios , ranging from equal - mass merger models ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) to galaxy `` harrassment '' ( moore et al .",
    "1998 ) and tidal interaction between a galaxy and the strongly varying mean cluster tidal field ( bekki 1999 ) .",
    "because nearly all of the k+a galaxies are classified as s0 s , and thus probably still maintain a major disk structure , it is unlikely that equal mass mergers can be responsible , since they tend to destroy disks ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "thus one of the alternate tidal scenarios must predominate .",
    "the bluer nuclei of the k+a galaxies does not appear compatible with a sudden global quenching of star formation , since that mechanism would be expected to leave behind a red bulge surrounded by a gradually fading and reddening disk , e.g. , at all times producing a logarithmic radial color gradient that is negative , such as is seen in early - type s0 s , e.g. , ngc3115 ( silva et al .",
    "1989 ) . the only way to reconcile the sudden quenching scenario with our observed radial color profiles is to have the disk eaten away from the outside in , _ over a considerable period of time_. in summary , while the high x - ray luminosity of cl1358 + 62 indicates that ram pressure stripping must play an important role in the evolution of its member galaxies , tidal interaction may be playing a key role as well .",
