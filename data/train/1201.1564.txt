    "the properties of hadrons in a thermal and dense medium are currently widely investigated , both experimentally and theoretically . in this respect",
    ", the heavy - ion experiments at rhic and lhc are producing a huge amount of data .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , it is still difficult to analyse these issues since one has to face nonperturbative calculations .",
    "the study of the spectral functions deserves particular attention since important information can be inferred from them , namely the behaviour of hadron masses and widths with temperature and density , or the highest temperature or density at which a state can exist .",
    "moreover , from the vector meson spectral functions at low energy it is possible to compute transport coefficients using kubo relations , together with other hydrodynamical quantities which can help in characterising the medium of quarks and gluons and in interpreting the experimental results @xcite .",
    "hadronic spectral functions at finite quark chemical potential have been investigated by the nambu - jona lasinio model @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and effective models @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this is a hard problem to deal with using lattice simulations , because of the sign problem occurring at nonzero chemical potential .",
    "some analyses of vector mesons and scalar glueballs have been carried out by lattice simulations with two colours , where the sign problem is absent @xcite .",
    "a study with three colours in a mean field approximation at strong coupling has appeared in @xcite .",
    "there are also experimental evidences of the modifications of @xmath1 spectral function in medium @xcite , as we discuss in sect .",
    "[ sec : vec ] ; reviews on theoretical and experimental results can be found in @xcite .    to address the nonperturbative problem of computing in - medium hadronic spectral functions",
    ", we use the ads / qcd soft - wall model @xcite , which has been recently developed following the holographic bottom - up approaches to qcd inspired by the ads / cft ( or gauge / gravity ) correspondence @xcite . in these phenomenological approaches ,",
    "gauge - invariant qcd operators are related to specific five - dimensional fields living in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) space , under the assumption that the strongly coupled gauge theory defined in a minkowski space is dual to a semiclassical gravity theory in an ads space .",
    "the duality consists in the equality of the partition functions of the two theories , under suitable boundary conditions , so that correlation functions of the strongly coupled theory can be obtained deriving a semiclassical functional @xcite .",
    "this relation between a perturbative and a nonperturbative theory makes the correspondence interesting , in particular in view of the application to qcd .",
    "a key feature , that any holographic model aiming at describing qcd must incorporate , is the inclusion of a mass scale that breaks conformal invariance and is related to the scale of confinement . in the soft - wall model",
    "this is achieved by inserting in the action a dilaton background field containing a mass parameter @xcite .",
    "other studies of hadronic spectral functions at finite chemical potential in so - called top - down holographic models can be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on scalar glueballs and light vector mesons , but the method we adopt is quite general and can be applied to other states .",
    "at @xmath2 and @xmath3 scalar glueballs can be described in the soft - wall model by introducing a massless scalar field @xmath4 , dual to the qcd operator @xmath5 @xcite , in the action : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the dilaton term of the soft - wall model , and @xmath8 is the determinant of the metric of the ads@xmath9 space @xmath10 with @xmath11 the ads@xmath9 radius ; in the following we set @xmath12 .",
    "the holographic coordinate @xmath13 runs in the range @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",
    "the dilaton profile is @xmath16 , and the mass parameter @xmath17 is fixed from the @xmath1 meson mass predicted in the model : @xmath18 gev .",
    "the quadratic form of the profile has been chosen as the simplest one allowing to reproduce regge behaviour for light hadron masses , and to get analytical results in several sectors , mostly at @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is fixed from the matching with qcd of two - point function @xcite : @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 given in qcd by @xmath22 ) .    in order to study the scalar glueball spectral function at finite temperature and density , we follow the approach of @xcite , where the case of finite temperature and zero density have been considered ; the results obtained and the tools developed can be generalised to the finite density case in a straightforward way .",
    "when we switch temperature and quark chemical potential on , the action for the field @xmath4 is still , but with a different metric , which gathers information about temperature and density through a black - hole @xcite : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the position of the outer horizon of the black - hole , i.e. the lowest value which satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "this is known as ads / reissner - nordstrm metric ( ads / rn ) .",
    "the temperature of the black - hole is @xmath27 being @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 represents the charge of the black - hole , and is related to the chemical potential @xmath31 .",
    "let us clarify briefly this point . in the qcd generating functional , the quark chemical potential @xmath31 is the coefficient multiplying the quark number operator @xmath32 . in the dual theory ,",
    "such a coefficient is the source of the field associated to the quark number operator , namely the time component of a @xmath33 gauge field @xmath34 .",
    "the ads / rn metric is the result of the interaction of this field with the ads space . instead of solving",
    "coupled differential equations involving the metric , the dilaton and the gauge field , as in @xcite we use the ansatz : @xmath35 and , from the condition @xmath36 , we find @xmath37 @xmath38 is a dimensionless parameter of the model , which must scale as @xmath39 and can be determined studying different observables @xcite ; in the following we use @xmath40 . for convenience , we set @xmath41 , so all the following results are given in units of @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath42 of the glueball field in @xmath43 fourier space is defined by @xmath44 , being @xmath45 and @xmath46 the bulk field and the source of the qcd operator , respectively . from the action",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath42 can be computed @xmath47 as in @xcite , the case @xmath48 will be considered , so @xmath49 .",
    "the solution must satisfy two boundary conditions : @xmath50 and @xmath51{z\\to z_h } ( 1-z / z_h)^{-i\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega^2}\\ , z_h}{2\\ , ( 2-q^2 ) } } \\left(1+{\\cmcal o}(1-z / z_h)\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] i.e. , near the black - hole horizon we select the _ in - falling _ solution .",
    "this latter condition is needed in order to obtain the retarded green s function @xcite , which is computed by differentiating twice the on - shell action   with respect to the source @xmath52 .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath53 then , the spectral function is the imaginary part of the retarded green s function @xmath54 we have evaluated it for different values of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "some numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfglue ] : in the left panel the first peak of the spectral function ( multiplied by @xmath19 ) is plotted versus @xmath55 at @xmath56 for different values of the chemical potential , whereas in the right panel the analogous curves computed at @xmath57 for various values of temperature are plotted .",
    "as already observed at zero chemical potential in @xcite , at any finite and fixed value of @xmath31 the peaks of the spectral functions broaden and move towards smaller values of @xmath55 as the temperature of the medium is increased , up to the melting point , where no peak can be distinguished anymore .",
    "the same behaviour is also observed at fixed temperature , increasing the chemical potential .",
    "the broadening is a sign that , as temperature and quark chemical potential increase , the states become unstable , getting a finite width .",
    "this effect can also be appreciated by a quantum - mechanical argument .",
    "let us introduce the regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate @xmath58 @xcite , defined by the relation @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 correspond to @xmath62 , respectively ) . then , through the bogoliubov transformation @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , the equation of motion for the glueball field @xmath65 becomes a schrdinger equation for @xmath66 : @xmath67 with potential @xmath68 the potential @xmath69 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluepot ] as a function of @xmath58 .",

    "the values of temperature and chemical potential are ( @xmath41 ) : @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( plain blue curve ) ; @xmath73 , @xmath74 ( dashed red curve ) ; @xmath75 , @xmath72 ( dotted green curve ) ; @xmath75 , @xmath74 ( dash - dotted purple curve).,width=264 ]    in order to extract the dependence of glueball masses on the temperature and chemical potential , we have fitted each peak with a deformed breit - wigner function @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the mass of the state and @xmath78 its width .",
    "we define the dissociation temperature as the lowest temperature at which the condition @xmath79 is fulfilled .",
    "this means that we consider a state as melted if the ratio between the maximum of the pure breit - wigner function ( @xmath80 ) and the squared width of the peak ( @xmath81 ) , the two parameters characterising the form of the peak in the @xmath82 plane , is lower than 1 .",
    "this criterion gives the same dissociation temperature at @xmath3 found in @xcite , namely @xmath83 .",
    "+ at very low values of both @xmath70 and @xmath31 , we compute masses as eigenvalues of the equation of motion , since in this case the black - hole is far away along the holographic coordinate axis ( @xmath13 ) and it does not affect the wavefunctions in an appreciable way . we perform a different bogoliubov transformation of the glueball field , @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , such that the equation of motion for the field @xmath86 reads : @xmath87 the wavefunctions can be found by solving , requiring that the eigenfunction vanishes at @xmath88 and for large @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluewf ] some of them are plotted at fixed @xmath89 , for different values of the chemical potential .",
    "when @xmath31 is larger than a certain value , the solutions can not be considered as eigenfunctions anymore , since their oscillatory behaviour near the black - hole horizon becomes important .",
    "we remark that the two methods described above to extract glueball masses give the same results for those values of @xmath70 and @xmath31 for which both can be applied .     and low values of the chemical potential : @xmath90 ( blue plain curve ) , @xmath91 ( red dashed ) ,",
    "@xmath92 ( yellow dotted ) , @xmath72 ( green dot - dashed , all quantities in units of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the latter is unstable , therefore for @xmath93 we can not solve the eigenvalue problem to determine the glueball masses.,width=264 ]    the variation of the squared mass and width of the lightest glueball is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluemass ] : we observe a decreasing of @xmath94 and an increasing of @xmath78 with temperature and chemical potential .",
    "this behaviour is similar to what has been obtained by an analysis of scalar glueball masses in a medium in @xmath95 lattice field theory @xcite , in which a mass decrease at a very low temperature and high density in the transition from the hadronic to a superfluid phase has been predicted .",
    "an important application of the above described method is in the light vector meson sector .",
    "in fact , the @xmath1 meson is considered as a very useful probe to investigate modifications of the properties of the hot and dense phase , since it can be easily reconstructed and its decay products carry information about the medium in the laboratory @xcite .    following the soft - wall model formulation @xcite",
    ", we introduce the gauge fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 associated to the @xmath98 gauge group , dual to the left- and right - handed quark currents of qcd , the global 4@xmath99 symmetries being gauged in the bulk . the vector field , which is dual to the qcd operator @xmath100 , is @xmath101 , and the action for this field in the quadratic approximation is @xmath102\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 , with @xmath104 , @xmath105 being the generators of the @xmath106 symmetry group ; we shall choose the gauge @xmath107 . by comparing the two - point correlation functions of vector currents , computed in qcd and in the soft - wall model , one can fix @xmath108 @xcite .",

    "fig : sfvec ] , for some values of temperature and chemical potential ; the first peak corresponds to the @xmath1 meson . in particular the quantity",
    "@xmath116 has been plotted since we expect the vector spectral funtion to increase quadratically for large values of @xmath117 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    like scalar glueballs ,",
    "also vector mesons become unstable and finally melt while temperature and quark chemical potential are increased .",
    "in fact , at high enough @xmath70 and/or @xmath31 the spectral function becomes flat , with no more resonances , reflecting the formation of a weakly interacting plasma of quarks and gluons .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : sfvec ] , one can notice that the dissociation of the first excited state occurs much earlier than the one of the ground state ( the @xmath1 meson ) .    the same analysis carried out in the glueball sector can be applied to vectors : using eq .",
    "it is possible to calculate the position of the peaks ( masses ) and their width , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vecmass ] .",
    "again , at low values of the two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath70 , the widths vanish and masses are computed by solving the equation of motion for the vector fields in the schrdinger form .",
    "[ fig : vecmass ] shows that the @xmath1 mass decreases with increasing temperature and chemical potential . in particular , at @xmath118 we observe a @xmath119 effect ( @xmath120 for the squared mass ) , while at an intermediate temperature @xmath121 the effect reduces to @xmath122 ( @xmath123 for the squared mass ) .    in the chiral model studied in @xcite to describe the in - medium behaviour of mesons ,",
    "the scaling of the @xmath1-meson mass has been related to parameters governing chiral symmetry breaking . in particular , along with the dropping of the chiral condensate at finite density and temperature , a @xmath124 decrease of the @xmath1 mass has been found at nuclear matter densities . in the soft - wall model both vector meson masses and the chiral condensate @xcite decrease at increasing temperature and density , qualitatively in agreement with the brown - rho picture , suggesting the existence of a relation between these two phenomena . in our holographic model ,",
    "chiral symmetry breaking and vector meson masses are two distinct sectors and a direct relationship probing such a scaling can not be explicitly found : nevertheless , a comparison between the finite density behaviour of the pion decay constant @xmath125 and the @xmath1 meson mass can be carried out , but deserves a separate study .    in @xcite , hatsuda and lee use qcd sum rules to obtain the density dependence of the @xmath1-meson mass ; they find a decreasing behaviour fitted by a linear function : @xmath126 , where @xmath1 is the density ( @xmath127  @xmath128 is the nuclear matter density ) , and their prediction for @xmath129 is @xmath130 .",
    "also in @xcite it is suggested that in - medium hadronic spectral functions carry important information on chiral structure of hot / dense matter . by studying unitarized chiral models ,",
    "a softening of @xmath131 and @xmath1 mesons is found , which is driven by the decrease of @xmath125 in nuclear matter . in @xcite a quark model of nuclear matter",
    "is put forward , in which quarks interact with the nuclear field . as a result ,",
    "a downward shift of @xmath132 mev has been predicted for the @xmath1 mass .",
    "a mass dropping of @xmath1 mesons has also been found in @xcite within a coupled - channel analysis , in @xcite within an extended vector meson dominance model , in @xcite within sum rules at finite nucleon density , and in lattice su(2 ) calculations @xcite .",
    "however the behaviour of hadrons in medium is still a debated issue , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "while the broadening of the spectral functions is widely accepted , the variation of the masses is unclear .",
    "some data agree with a small decrease @xcite , and other show a very small effect , even compatible with zero @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite an analysis of the experimental data through various theoretical models has been carried out . in @xcite , a @xmath133 decrease in mass for the @xmath1 meson at normal nuclear density",
    "is found from a linear fit , as suggested by the hatsuda - lee model @xcite ( @xmath134 ) . in @xcite a modification of the @xmath1 spectral function is reported which is not compatible with a mass shift , but only with a broadening of the corresponding peak . in the analysis performed by the clas collaboration @xcite both the mass shifts by the brown - rho @xcite and",
    "the hatsuda - lee @xcite models are ruled out , since no evidence of large modifications to the @xmath1 mass has been found ( @xmath135 ) , and an upper limit for @xmath129 has been set to @xmath136 with a 95@xmath137 confidence level .",
    "the prediction of this model for the shift parameter @xmath129 is @xmath138 at @xmath139  mev , where @xmath140  mev is the value of the quark chemical potential corresponding to the nuclear matter density @xmath141 .",
    "however , in the present model the quark density @xmath142 is related to the chemical potential in a model dependent way ( through @xmath38 ) , and again we have used @xmath40 .",
    "although at values of @xmath31 corresponding to the dissociation of the @xmath1 meson we find a @xmath143 decrease of its mass , for @xmath31 corresponding to nuclear matter density the effect is only @xmath144 , in agreement with the experimental analyses that find a small or compatible with zero effect .",
    "there are also theoretical studies predicting an increase in mass @xcite .",
    "a similar result has been found in the hard - wall model , another bottom - up holographic model characterised by a different mechanism of conformal symmetry breaking @xcite ; in particular , an increase of meson masses with density at @xmath2 is found by solving the corresponding equations of motion @xcite .",
    "this behaviour , which is in contrast with the one found in our analysis and with the experimental results described above , is similar to the one found in other top - down holographic approaches @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that it would be interesting to extend the calculations based on the holographic approach to heavy mesons like @xmath145 , investigating the behaviour of these states in a hot and dense medium ; some methods have been proposed about how to describe charmonium - like states in the soft - wall model @xcite .",
    "studying scalar glueballs and light vector mesons in a hot and dense medium , we have observed a broadening of the peaks in their spectral function , which is a signal that the states become unstable as temperature and chemical potential are increased , and a shift of the position of the peaks towards smaller values of the mass , signaling a decrease of the hadron masses . while the first effect has also been found in other theoretical studies and in some experimental data , the latter is still a debated issue .",
    "we have also found that at @xmath2 the melting of glueballs and vectors occurs at @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "if we set @xmath148 , as in @xcite , the numerical values of the chemical potential are @xmath149  mev for the glueball and @xmath150  mev for the vector mesons . at increasing temperature , these critical values decrease , and at @xmath151 ( @xmath152  mev ) and @xmath153 ( @xmath154  mev )",
    "the spectral function of glueballs and vectors , respectively , is almost flat already at zero density . applying the soft - wall model , inspired by the ads / qcd correspondence",
    ", we can address the nonperturbative problem with little effort , numerically solving a linear differential equation , and trying to collect as much information as such a phenomenological model of holographic qcd can provide .",
    "the broadening of the peaks confirms that the model captures an important accepted feature of qcd .",
    "the decreasing of the masses is a prediction which , particularly in the case of vector mesons , can be tested in the experiments ; in the case of the density dependence , such a prediction , obtained in the soft - wall model , is different from the one obtained in other holographic approaches .",
