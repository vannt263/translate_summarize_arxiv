    "during last decades colliders provide most of our knowledge on fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions .",
    "particle colliders can be classified concerning center - of - mass energy , colliding beams and collider types :    * collider types : ring - ring , linac - linac and linac - ring , * center - of - mass energy : energy frontiers and particle factories , * colliding beams : hadron , lepton , photon , lepton - hadron and photon - hadron colliders .",
    "the ring - ring colliders are most advanced from technology viewpoint and are widely used around the world . as for the linac - linac colliders ,",
    "essential experience is handled due to slc    .energy frontier colliders : colliding beams vs collider types . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in 1980s , the idea of using high energy photon beams , obtained by compton backscattering of laser light off a beam of high energy electrons , was considered for @xmath1e and @xmath5 colliders ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then the same method was proposed for constructing @xmath1p colliders on the base of linac - ring type ep machines in @xcite .",
    "rough estimations of the main parameters of @xmath1p collisions are given in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of these parameters on the distance between conversion region ( cr ) and interaction point ( ip ) was analyzed in @xcite , where some design problems were considered .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath1p colliders are unique feature of linac - ring ep colliders and could not be constructed on the base of standard ring - ring type ep machines ( for arguments see @xcite ) .",
    "concerning fcc based @xmath3 colliders , center of mass energy and luminosity are approximately the same as of corresponding ep colliders ( @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ) for one - pass linacs .",
    "let us mention that energy recovery is not effective for @xmath3 colliders since electron bunches are destroyed during conversion ( for details see @xcite ) .    regarding the analyses performed for thera and lhec ,",
    "@xmath1p colliders have shown their superiority compared to the corresponding ep colliders for a lot of sm and bsm phenomena ( small @xmath8 , @xmath9 and so on ) .",
    "similar studies should be performed for fcc based @xmath1p colliders .",
    "certainly , fcc based @xmath1a colliders will bring out great opportunities for qcd and nuclear physics research . for example , @xmath1a option will give an opportunity to investigate quark - gluon plasma at very high temperatures but relatively low nuclear density ( according to vmd , proposed machine will be at the same time @xmath10-nucleus collider ) .",
    "different aspects of the thera based @xmath1p colliders have been considered in @xcite . in @xcite linac@xmath11lhc",
    "based @xmath1p colliders have been considered for different linac scenarios .",
    "similar work on fcc based @xmath1p and @xmath1a colliders is under progress .",
    "in this study it is shown that for ilc@xmath11fcc and pwfa - lc@xmath11fcc based ep colliders , luminosity values up to @xmath2 are achievable with",
    "this study is supported by tubitak under the grant no 114f337 .",
    "a. akay and s. sultansoy are grateful to organizers of the fcc week 2016 for giving opportunity to present our results at this distinguished conference ."
