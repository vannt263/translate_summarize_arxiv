    "this paper is a survey of basic results on the geometry of finite dimensional normed linear spaces , which we , following thompson @xcite , call _ minkowski geometry_. we place special emphasis on planar results , since there are many planar results which are simple and elementary , or at least considered to be so , which are often needed in work on minkowski geometry , often rediscovered , and not often proved .",
    "they come from various parts of mathematics : discrete geometry and geometry of numbers ( the historical origin of minkowski geometry ) , convex geometry , functional analysis , and lately also from optimization , theoretical computer science and combinatorics .",
    "our motivation for this survey is that the book of thompson @xcite does not cover many of these results ; neither does the handbook of convex geometry @xcite ( as admitted in its introduction ) .",
    "previous surveys of this type , such as petty @xcite and yaglom @xcite , are old and not easily accessible . in many of these results , the proofs , once written out , have a tendency to be messy . in this regard schffer",
    "@xcite says ( in 1967 )    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the amazing amount of underbrush that has to be cleared away ,  , indicates , to this author at least , that the geometry of finite - dimensional convex sets is still quite imperfectly known .",

    "we then survey the extensions to higher dimensions .",
    "there are many topics that are not included here , but which will appear in a continuation of this survey , such as @xmath0-segments and @xmath0-convexity , characterizations of smoothness , various notions of angle measures , diametrically maximal sets , sets of constant width , packing and covering of unit balls , various discrete inequalities , hadwiger numbers , bisectors , erds - type problems , approximation theory ( chebyshev sets ) , isometries ( the mazur - ulam theorem and its relatives , beckman - quarles type theorems , banach - mazur distance ) , parameters of functional analysis , applications to discrete optimization problems such as minimum spanning trees and steiner minimum trees , the fermat - torricelli problem , etc .",
    "we do not consider the local theory of banach spaces itself @xcite nor differential and integral geometry of minkowski spaces , for which the main reference is @xcite .",
    "we have here mainly concentrated on the triangle inequality and its consequences such as the monotonicity lemma ; geometric characterizations of strict convexity and smoothness ; normality ( birkhoff orthogonality ) , conjugate diameters and radon curves ; equilateral triangles and the affine regular hexagon construction ; equilateral sets ; various aspects of circles and spheres : intersection of circles , circumscribed spheres , characterizations of spheres , circumference and area of the unit circle , and equilateral polygons inscribed in the unit circle .",
    "also , we do not consider infinite dimensional spaces , and for the sake of simplicity , we only consider minkowski spaces with a symmetric norm ( @xmath1 ) satisfying the triangle inequality .",
    "as is well known , the axioms of minkowski spaces were introduced by minkowski @xcite , in connection with problems from number theory .",
    "however , it seems that the earliest reference to non - euclidean geometry in the sense of minkowski geometry was made by riemann in his habilitationsvortrag @xcite , where he mentioned the @xmath2-norm .",
    "see lvarez @xcite for a discussion of riemann s remarks on non - euclidean norms .",
    "hilbert @xcite in his famous lecture delivered before the international congress of mathematicians in 1900 gives a description of minkowski geometry in his fourth problem .",
    "two important and neglected early papers , considering minkowski geometry from a geometric ( as opposed to analytic ) point of view are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "minkowski geometry was studied , especially by busemann @xcite , in order to throw more light on finsler geometry , introduced by finsler @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite . for recent developments in finsler geometry , see lvarez @xcite . closely related is the subject of distance geometry , cf .  the work of menger and his school , summarized by menger @xcite and blumenthal @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , as well as the works of alexandrov @xcite and rinow @xcite .    in functional analysis ,",
    "although concentrating from its outset almost exclusively on infinite dimensional spaces @xcite , various fine geometric properties of finite dimensional spaces play an important role in the so - called local theory of banach spaces @xcite . for infinite dimensional banach space geometry ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "also , characterizations of inner product spaces lead to interesting geometry of finite dimensional spaces @xcite .",
    "recently , in operations research and vlsi design , various norms have started playing an important role , especially @xmath3-norms and polygonal norms ; see e.g.  @xcite",
    ".    for physical interpretations of minkowski spaces , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the two most common equivalent definitions of a minkowski space are by giving axioms for a norm @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the underlying finite dimensional real vector space , or by giving axioms for the unit ball @xmath7 , namely @xmath8    in the sequel , @xmath9 will be an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space with norm @xmath10 , unit ball @xmath11 , and unit sphere @xmath12 .",

    "circumference_. we use the following notation : @xmath31 .",
    "metric segment _ is a curve which is isometric to a closed segment of the real line , a _ metric line _ is a curve parametrized by @xmath32 and isometric to the real line , and a _ geodesic _ ( a notion due to busemann @xcite ; see also @xcite ) is a curve that is locally a metric segment , i.e. , each point of the curve has a closed neighbourhood that is a metric segment .",
    "we use the standard facts about duals , denoting functionals by @xmath33 etc .",
    "an important fact is that all minkowski spaces are reflexive banach spaces .",
    "we denote the convex hull of a set @xmath28 by @xmath34 , the positive hull by @xmath35 , the interior by @xmath36 , the relative interior by @xmath37 , and the boundary by @xmath38 .",
    "a ( positive ) _ homothet _ of a set @xmath39 is a set of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are arbitrary .",
    "thus we allow translates as special homothets ( with the point of homothety at infinity ) .",
    "we say that @xmath14 is normal to @xmath43 , denoted @xmath44 , if @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , or equivalently , if the unit ball is supported at @xmath47 by a line parallel to @xmath48 . see section  [ normalsection ] for a discussion of this notion .",
    "the difference body of a convex body @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "given any convex body @xmath49 , its difference body is centrally symmetric , hence induces a norm for which @xmath49 has constant width .",
    "face _ of a convex body @xmath49 is a subset @xmath51 of @xmath49 such that , whenever the relative interior of some segment @xmath18}\\subseteq c$ ] intersects @xmath28 , then @xmath18}\\subseteq s$ ] .",
    "it is a well - known fact from convex geometry that any point of a convex body is contained in the relative interior of a unique face ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1.2 ) ) .",
    "a set of points @xmath28 in a finite dimensional vector space is _ antipodal _ if for any distinct @xmath52 there exist parallel ( distinct ) hyperplanes supporting @xmath34 at @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "the set @xmath28 is _ strictly antipodal _ if it is furthermore possible to find hyperplanes containing no other point of @xmath34 .",
    "we only consider the triangle inequality and some of its simple consequences .",
    "we omit altogether a discussion of hypermetric inequalities , piecewise linear inequalities , duals of zonoids , etc . , since this is well - treated in e.g.  the handbook of convex geometry @xcite .",

    "@xcite have many inequalities for triangles , which in fact are true for all metric spaces , since they are purely algebraic consequences of the triangle inequality ( e.g.  inequalities 1.11.24 in @xcite ) .",
    "we now discuss the triangle inequality and metric lines .",
    "when one defines a distance function using only a star - shaped body , then the triangle inequality is equivalent to the convexity of unit ball , and the strict triangle inequality ( equality only for collinear points ) is equivalent to strict convexity .",
    "this was already proved by minkowski ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kapitel 1 , paragraph 18 ) .    in the following two propositions we analyse the triangle inequality further .",
    "the first , characterizing specific instances of equality in the triangle inequality , has been noticed by alt @xcite , and also by goab and hrlen @xcite .",

    "letting @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 .",
    "suppose now @xmath62 .",
    "then we see that the above representation of @xmath63 is a convex combination of @xmath53 and @xmath48 , with @xmath63 strictly between @xmath53 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus we have three collinear vectors on the boundary of the unit ball , and it follows that their convex hull is also on the boundary , i.e. , @xmath56}$ ] is a segment on the unit sphere .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath56}$ ] is a segment on the unit sphere .",
    "let @xmath64 .",
    "thus we have the convex combination @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 is on the segment @xmath56}$ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath66 is a unit vector , @xmath67 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the above proposition has also been observed recently by nitka and wiatrowska @xcite , who furthermore make the remark that , given any three points in @xmath0-dimensional vector space , there is a norm such that the three points give equality in the triangle inequality .",
    "one merely has to give a unit ball with the right segment on its boundary .",
    "goab and hrlen @xcite made a very complete analysis of the triangle inequality .",
    "the following proposition , due to them , states that the extreme points of the unit ball coincide with the directions of strict inequality in the triangle inequality , and with the directions of unique _ metric segments _ , i.e. , curves @xmath24 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 such that @xmath68 .",
    "this result has also been observed recently by toranzos @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be a unit vector .",
    "then the following are equivalent .    1 .",
    "@xmath42 is an extreme point of the unit ball .",
    "2 .   for any distinct @xmath54",
    "such that @xmath69 we have @xmath70 iff @xmath54 are collinear .",

    "metric segments and lines in a more general context have also been investigated by menger @xcite .",
    "it is also now simple to characterize metric segments in general . note that a curve from @xmath16 to @xmath17 is a metric segment iff it has length @xmath71 . see section  [ definitions ] for the definition of a face of a convex body .",
    "[ msegchar ] a curve @xmath24 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 is a metric segment iff each directed chord of @xmath24 is in a direction contained in the unique face of the unit ball containing @xmath72 in its relative interior .",
    "there are at least @xmath73 directions in which there are unique metric segments ( goab and hrlen show at least @xmath74 in the case of a non - symmetric norm ) , and more if the unit ball is not a cross - polytope .",
    "this can be seen from the higher - dimensional generalization of proposition  [ conjdiam ] ( in section  [ conjdiamsection ] below ) .",
    "it was noticed by szenthe @xcite that in certain minkowski spaces there exist geodesics which are not metric segments .",
    "for example , using proposition  [ msegchar ] , the curve in figure  [ fig2 ] is easily seen to be a geodesic .",
    "szenthe gave the following characterization of minkowski spaces which have geodesics that are not metric segments .",
    "a minkowski space has geodesics which are not metric segments iff the unit sphere contains two segments with a common endpoint that are not contained in the same supporting hyperplane .",
    "we now consider special consequences of the triangle inequality in minkowski planes .",
    "the following two lemmas also hold for higher dimensional spaces , but the argument is two - dimensional . they are mentioned in e.g.  @xcite .",

    "by lemma  [ maxineq ] it follows that @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 , then , since @xmath97 , we have equality in the above inequality , and it follows from lemma  [ maxineq ] that @xmath104 , a contradiction .",

    "it follows that if the plane is not rectilinear one can not have the diagonals as the two shortest distances between the four points , and if the plane is strictly convex one can not have two opposite sides as the two largest distances between the four points ( mentioned by grnbaum and kelly ( * ? ? ?",

    "* chapter 2 ) for the euclidean case ) are immediately extendable to minkowski planes , using elementary inequalities still valid for minkowski planes : for inscribed @xmath110-gons one needs proposition  [ quadlemma ] , and for circumscribed @xmath110-gons one needs    in a convex quadrilateral @xmath106 in a minkowski plane , if @xmath111 and @xmath112 intersect on the side of @xmath21 opposite @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and @xmath21 and @xmath115 intersect on the side of @xmath112 opposite @xmath16 and @xmath114 , then @xmath116    the remainder of the proof ( see @xcite ) is then easily adapted for minkowski planes , and we obtain    let @xmath49 be a convex disc in a minkowski plane @xmath29 . for each @xmath117 , let @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) be an @xmath110-gon of minimum ( maximum ) perimeter circumscribed about @xmath49 ( inscribed in @xmath49 ) .",

    "the unit ball of a minkowski space is _ rotund _ if its boundary does not contain any straight line segment , i.e. , each boundary point is an extreme point .",
    "there are various strengthenings of the definition of strict convexity , such as uniform convexity , but these stronger concepts are usually only stronger in the infinite dimensional context ; see the survey by cudia @xcite .",
