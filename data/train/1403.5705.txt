    "synchronization phenomena in large ensembles of coupled systems play a prominent role in many branches of natural and social sciences as well as in engineering  @xcite .",
    "the study of collective synchronization has many applications including the modeling of the flashing of groups of fireflies  @xcite , the collective oscillations of pancreatic beta cells  @xcite , the human cardiorespiratory system  @xcite , and the pedestrian induced oscillations in bridges  @xcite . a fundamental contribution to the mathematical aspects of collective synchronization",
    "was given by kuramoto  @xcite . in 1975",
    "kuramoto proposed a model to describe the behaviour of a population of coupled non - linear oscillators , employing three key simplifying assumptions  @xcite , i.e. , ( i ) the coupling strength was chosen to be homogeneous for all pairs of coupling oscillators ; ( ii ) the coupling strength and the natural frequency become finite ; and ( iii ) the number of oscillators was considered to be infinite .",
    "diversity in the oscillators properties is usually incorporated by taking natural frequencies from a given probability distribution function .",
    "the phase transition to synchronization occurs when the coupling strength exceeds a threshold , which depends on the probability density function of the natural frequencies .    in 2008",
    ", ott and antonsen  @xcite introduced an ansatz for studying the behaviour of globally coupled oscillators .",
    "the ott - antonsen ansatz has been considered to investigate continuously time - dependent collective behavior  @xcite and for the study of delay heterogeneity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , such ansatz has enabled to find nonuniversal transitions to synchrony in the model with a phase lag for certain unimodal frequency distributions  @xcite .",
    "although these works have provided important contributions to synchronization theory , only oscillators with global coupling have been taken into account  @xcite .",
    "thus , a natural extension of these works can investigate how these results change when different coupling schemes are introduced .",
    "barlev et al .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamics of coupled phase oscillators , but such approach involved integrating @xmath0 ordinary differential equations . to overcome this limitation , in this report",
    "we generalize the ott - antonsen ansatz to complex networks in the continuum limit to investigate a time - dependent phase transition to synchronization .",
    "we reduce the dimension of the system of equations from @xmath0 to the number of possible degrees in the network .    motivated by the results of the first - order kuramoto model",
    ", we substantially extend the theory to the second - order kuramoto model . the kuramoto model with inertia",
    "has been widely used for deepening the understanding of power grids  @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions  @xcite and many other applications  @xcite .",
    "therefore a theory that investigates the low - dimensional character of such systems giving access to their time - dependent behavior can bring important new insights into the study .",
    "we substantially address this problem for what is perhaps the simplest choice of inertia term . in this case , the fourier series expansion , the key approach of the ott - antonsen ansatz , no longer applies directly .",
    "thus , a generalized framework for the second derivative needs to be developed , as already pointed out in recent studies  @xcite . in order to fill this gap , we derive self - consistent equations and seek the time evolution of the order parameter .",
    "comparison of analytical and simulation results shows a good agreement .",

    "the simplest and most straightforward way is to include one unity inertia term .",

    ", it is not possible to follow the same procedure to derive the nonlinear evolution of the order parameter @xmath25 . due to the existence of the inertia term and the bistable area of the stability diagram  @xcite , we rewrite eq .",

    "it is interesting to find that instead of three different regions mentioned above , the oscillators fall into either of the following two groups .",
    "( i ) if the natural frequencies of nodes are within the boundary of the phase synchronization regime @xmath67\\equiv[-4\\sqrt{kr}/\\pi,4\\sqrt{kr}/\\pi]$ ] which is the same as the above stable fixed points area , these nodes converge to fixed points and the stationary state of phases are functions of @xmath13 , which are equal to @xmath68 .",

    "( ii ) in contrast , the oscillators with @xmath70 are drift .",
    "thus , in networks , instead of three different areas of single pendulum model , only two distinct areas could exist : fixed point and limit cycle .",
    "nodes with the same natural frequency are either converging to single fixed points or oscillating periodically ; and nodes always return to previous states even after large perturbations .    to investigate how the phase synchronization boundary changes with different coupling strengths , we project the fig .
