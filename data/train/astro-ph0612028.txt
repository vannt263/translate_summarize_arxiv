    "outflowing winds from the accretion disks around supermassive black holes provide a potential mechanism for extracting angular momentum from the accreting material , allowing accretion to proceed .",
    "they are also cosmologically important because they provide energy and momentum feedback to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "traditionally , broad absorption lines ( bals ; fwhm @xmath1 2,000 km  s@xmath2 ) have been used to study such outflowing winds , because their large line widths and smooth line profiles suggest an association with the wind .",
    "intrinsic narrow absorption lines ( nals ; fwhm @xmath3 500 km  s@xmath2 ) that are physically related to the quasars are an alternative and more promising tool for examining the physical conditions of the outflow than bals for two important reasons : ( i ) nals do not suffer from self - blending ( i.e. , a blend of blue and red members of doublets such as c  iv@xmath41548,1551 ) , and ( ii ) nals are found in a wider variety of agns , while bals are detected primarily in radio - quiet quasars .    in spite of their potential importance",
    ", nals have not received as much attention as bals , because it is difficult to distinguish intrinsic nals from nals that are not physically related to the quasars ( i.e. , _ intervening _ nals ) , produced in intervening galaxies , the igm , milky way gas , or gas in the quasar host galaxies . with the advent of high - dispersion spectroscopy of faint objects ,",
    "it has become possible to identify intrinsic nals , based primarily on one or both of the following indicators : ( a ) the dilution of absorption troughs by unocculted light ( e.g. , hamann et al . 1997 ) , and ( b ) time variability of line profiles ( e.g. , depth , equivalent width , and centroid ) , within a year in the absorber s rest frame ( e.g. , barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "we have constructed a large , relatively unbiased , equivalent width limited sample of _ intrinsic _ nal systems found in the high - resolutional ( @xmath5 = 37,500 ) spectra of @xmath0=24 quasars taken with keck / hires .",
    "we identify 150 nal systems that contain 124 c  iv , 12 n  v , and 50 si  iv doublets , of which 39 are identified as intrinsic nal systems on the basis of their partial coverage signature . using this sample , we study their demographics , the distribution of their physical properties , and any relations between them .",
    "we separate intrinsic and intervning nal systems using the partial coverage ( pc ) of doublets ( e.g. , wampler , chugai , & petitjean 1995 ) . of the 124 c  iv doublet",
    ", we find 19%  show pc .",
    "similarly , 18%  of si  iv doublets and 75%  of n  v doublets show pc .",
    "if we focus on only systems near the quasar redshift ( @xmath6 @xmath7 5000 km  s@xmath2 ; hereafter associated nals ) , the fraction of c  iv doublets showing pc increases to 33% .",
    "no associated si  iv doublet shows pc , while all n  v doublets showing pc are associated .",
    "( for n  v , we can only probe associated systems due to severe ly@xmath8 forest contamination at larger velocities ) .",
    "richards ( 2001 ) estimate that as many as @xmath936%  of c  iv nals may be intrinsic systems appearing at high ejection velocity . taken at face value ,",
    "this may imply that only @xmath950%  of intrinsic systems show pc .",
    "we also find that the fraction of quasars that have one or more intrinsic nal systems is about 50% , although this is a lower limit because our spectra do not have full offset velocity coverage and because some intrinsic absorbers may not exhibit the signature of partial coverage .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is that 50%  of the solid angle around a typical quasar is covered by the absorbers , _ on average_.      considering the ionization structure of the 39 intrinsic nal systems in our sample , we find the following two major categories , which may represent absorbers of different densities and/or at different distances from the ionizing source .",
    "strong c  iv systems : :     these are characterized by strong ( i.e. , large equivalent width ) ,    partially covered c   iv nals , strong ly@xmath8 lines , and    relatively weak or undetectable n  v nals . of the 28 systems in this    category , 25 have intermediate ionization lines ( such as si  iii and    c  iii ) and 15 have low ionization absorption lines ( such as si  ii and    c  ii ) ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "strong n  v systems : :     these are characterized by strong n  v nals , and relatively weak ,    non - black ly@xmath8 lines .",
    "c  iv and o  vi nals may also be    detected in these systems , and in some cases o  vi may be stronger than    n  v. we find 11 systems in this category , of which 5 have detected    intermediate ionization transitions , and only 1 has detected low    ionization transitions ( see figure  1 ) .    in the 15 strong c  iv systems with low ionization transitions detected ,",
    "the line profiles of the c  iv nals and the low ionization lines are similar .",
    "moreover , the low ionization lines are usually detected at the same velocities as the partially covered c  iv nals , implying that both families of lines arise in the same parcels of gas .",
    "about 50%  of intrinsic nal systems include low - ionization lines , while the fraction of bal systems with low - ionization lines ( i.e. , lobals ) among all bal systems is only 1317%  ( e.g. , sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; reichard et al .",
    "the different ionization conditions of intrinsic nals and bals suggest that they may be located in different regions around the accretion disk .",
    "we have obtained six subaru / hds and two het / mrs spectra of the quasar hs1603 + 3820 ( @xmath10 = 2.542 ) spanning an interval of approximately 1.2 years in the quasar rest frame , for the purpose of monitoring intrinsic systems . among 9 c  iv systems ,",
    "only the mini - bal system at @xmath11 @xmath9 2.43 ( @xmath6 @xmath9 9,500 km  s@xmath2 from the quasar emission redshift ) shows both time variability and partial coverage .",
    "we fit models only to the bluest portion of the c  iv mini - bal profile where self - blending is not severe .",
    "all fit parameters ( i.e. , column density , doppler parameter , coverage fraction , and shift velocity ) as well as the total equivalent width of the system vary significantly with time , even on short time scales .",
    "however , the profile parameters do not correlate with each other , with one exception : the equivalent widths of all the troughs in this system vary together .",
    "we have examined a number of ways of explaining the above variations of the c  iv mini - bal and we have found two viable possibilities .",
    "scattering of continuum photons : :     the observed partial coverage signature is the result of continuum    photons scattering around the absorber and into our cylinder of sight .",
    "the observed changes in mini - bal equivalent widths are thus produced    by variations in the scattered continuum that dilutes the absorption    troughs .",
    "this idea can be tested observationally through    spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , brotherton et al .",
    "screening of variable optical depth : :     the illumination of the uv absorber fluctuates on short time scales .",
    "we suggest that these fluctuations are caused by a screen of variable    optical depth between the mini - bal gas and the continuum source .",
    "this    screen might be identified with the shielding gas invoked or predicted    in some outflow models . moreover , it could be analogous to the    `` warm '' absorbers observed in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies    and some quasars ( crenshaw et al .",
    "this picture can also explain    the variations in the coverage fraction , which appear to be unrelated    to the ionic column density changes .",
