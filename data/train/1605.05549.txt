    "smartphones equipped with many different sensors such as _ gps , light , orientation and motion _ are continuously providing more features to end users in order to interact with their real - world surroundings .",
    "developers can have access to the mobile sensors either by 1 ) writing native code using mobile os apis  @xcite , 2 ) recompiling html5 code into a native app  @xcite , or 3 ) using standard apis provided by the w3c which are accessible through javascript code within a mobile browser .",
    "the last method has the advantage of not needing any app - store approval for releasing the app or doing future updates .",
    "more importantly , the javascript code is platform independent , i.e. , once the code is developed it can be executed within any modern browser on any mobile os .    * in - browser access risks . *",
    "while sensor - enabled mobile web applications provide users more functionalities , they raise new privacy and security concerns .",
    "both the academic community and the industry have recognised such issues regarding certain sensors such as geolocation @xcite . for a website to access the geolocation data",
    ", it must ask for explicit user permission .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is little work evaluating the risks of in - browser access to other sensors . unlike in - app attacks ,",
    "an in - browser attack , i.e. , via javascript code embedded in a web page , does not require any app installation .",
    "in addition , javascript code does not require any user permission to access sensor data such as device motion and orientation .",
    "furthermore , there is no notification while javascript is reading the sensor data stream .",
    "hence , such in - browser attacks can be carried out far more covertly than the in - app counterparts .",
    "however , an effective in - browser attack still has to overcome the technical challenge that the sampling rates available in browser are much lower than those in app .",
    "for example , as we observed in @xcite , frequency rates of motion and orientation sensor data available in - browser are 3 to 5 times lower than those of accelerometer and gyroscope available in - app .    * in - browser attacks . * many popular browsers such as safari , chrome , firefox , opera and dolphin",
    "have already implemented access to the above sensor data . as we demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "all of these mobile browsers allow such access when the code is placed in any part of the active tab including _ iframes _ ( figure [ attack ] , a ) . in some cases such as chrome and dolphin on ios , an inactive tab can have access to the sensor measurements as well ( figure [ attack ] , b ) .",
    "even worse , some browsers such as safari allow the inactive tabs to access the sensor data , when the browser is minimised ( figure [ attack ] , c ) , or even when the screen is locked ( figure [ attack ] , d ) .    through experiments , we find that mobile operating systems and browsers do not implement consistent access control policies in regard to mobile orientation and motion sensor data .",
    "partly , this is because w3c specifications  @xcite do not specify any policy and do not discuss any risks associated with this potential vulnerability .",
    "also , because of the low sampling rates available in browser , the community have been neglecting the security risks associated with in - browser access to such sensor data .",
    "however , in touchsignatures  @xcite , we showed that despite the low sampling rates , it is possible to identify user touch actions such as click , scroll , and zoom and even the numpad s digits . in this paper , we introduce pinlogger.js , an attack on full 4-digit pins as opposed to only single digits in  @xcite .    * mobile sensors . * today , sensors are everywhere : from your personalised devices such as mobiles , tablets , watches , fitness trackers , and other wearables , to your tv , car , kitchen , home , and to the roads , parking lots , and smart cities .",
    "these new technologies are equipped with many different sensors such as nfc , accelerometer , orientation and motion and are connected to each other .",
    "these sensors are continuously providing more features to end users in order to interact with their real world surroundings .",
    "while the users are benefiting from richer and more personalised apps which are using these sensors for different applications such as fitness , gaming , and even security application such as authentication , the growing number of sensors introduces new security and privacy risks to end users , and makes the task of sensor management more complex .",
    "* research questions .",
    "* while sensors on mobile platforms are getting more powerful , and starting to collect more information about the users and their environment , we want to evaluate the general knowledge about these sensors among the mobile users .",
    "we are particularly interested to know the level of concern people may have about these sensors being able to threaten their privacy and security .",
    "* contributions . * in this work , we contribute to the study of sensors and their actual risks and their perceived risks by users as follows :    * we introduce pinlogger.js , an attack on full 4-digit pins as opposed to only single digits in  @xcite .",
    "we show that unregulated access to these sensors impose more serious security risks to the users in comparison with more well - known sensors such as camera , light and microphone .",
    "* we conduct user studies to investigate users understanding about these sensors and also their perception of the security risks associated with them .",
    "we show that users in fact have fewer security concerns about these sensors comparing to more well - known ones .",
    "* we study and challenge current suggested solutions , and discuss why our studies show they can not be effective .",
    "we argue that a usable and secure solution is not straightforward and requires further research .",
    "the potential threats to the user security posed by an unauthorised access to the motion and orientation sensor data are not immediately clear . here we demonstrate two simple scenarios which show that sensitive user information such as phone calls timing and physical activities can be deduced from device orientation and motion sensor data obtained from javascript .    users tend to move their mobile devices in distinctive manners while performing certain tasks on the devices , or by simply carrying them .",
    "examples of the former include answering a call or taking a photo , while the latter covers their transport mode . in both cases , an identifiable succession of movements",
    "is exhibited by the device . as a result ,",
    "a web - based program which has access to the device orientation and motion data may reveal sensitive facts about users such as the exact timing information of the start and end of phone calls and that of taking photos . on the other hand , while the user is simply carrying her device , the device movement pattern may reveal information about the user s transport mode , e.g. , if the user is stationary at one place , walking , running , on the bus , in a car , or on the train .",
    "we present the results of two initial experiments that we have performed on a nexus  5 using _",
    "maxthon browser _",
    "( as an example of a browser that allows javascript to access sensor data even when the screen is locked ) .    * motion and orientation sensors detail . * before , presenting the results , we first explain the motion and orientation sensors in detail . according to w3c specifications  @xcite motion and orientation sensor data are a series of different measurements as follows :    * device _ orientation _ which provides the physical orientation of the device , expressed as three rotation angles ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) in the device s local coordinate frame , * device _ acceleration _ which provides the physical acceleration of the device , expressed in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in the device s local coordinate frame , * device _ acceleration - including - gravity _ which is similar to acceleration except that it includes gravity as well , * device _ rotation rate _ which provides the rotation rate of the device about the local coordinate frame , expressed as three rotation angles ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , and * _ interval _ which provides the constant sampling rate and is expressed in milliseconds ( ms ) .",
    "the device coordinate frame is defined with respect to the standard position of the mobile screen .",
    "when it is in the portrait mode , @xmath3 and @xmath4 axes are in the plane of the screen and are positive towards the screen s right and up , and @xmath5 is perpendicular to the plane of the screen and is positive outwards from the screen . moreover , the sensor data discussed above are processed sensor data obtained from multiple physical sensors such as gyroscope and accelerometer . in the rest of this paper , unless specified otherwise , by sensor data we mean the sensor data accessible through mobile browsers which include acceleration , acceleration - including - gravity , rotation rate , and orientation .",
    "* phone call timing .",
    "* in the first experiment , we opened the website carrying our javascript code , and then locked the screen .",
    "the javascript code continued to log orientation and motion data while the android phone was left on a desk .",
    "for this experiment , we used another phone to call the android phone four times with a few seconds apart between the calls .",
    "as demonstrated in fig .  [ call ]  ( left ) , the 4 distinct phone calls along with their timing are recognisable from the three dimensions of acceleration ( including gravity ) which come from the device motion sensor . for a better comparison , fig .",
    "[ call ]  ( right ) shows the received call history of the phone during the experiment with their start times and durations . as shown in this figure",
    ", the captured sensor data match the call history .",
    "* user physical activities . * in the second experiment , we again locked the phone and recorded the sensor data during 22 seconds of sitting , 34 seconds of walking and 25 seconds of slow running .",
    "we observed that the mentioned activities have visibly distinctive sensor streams .",
    "as an example , fig .  [ sitting ] shows the acceleration data from motion sensor .",
    "as it can be seen , the mentioned activities are recognisable from each other since they are visibly different in the sensor measurements .",
    "our initial evaluations suggest that discovering device movement related information such as call times and user s mode of transport can be easily implemented .",
    "however , as we will explain , distinguishing user pins is a lot harder as the induced sensor measurements are only subtly different . in the following sections",
    ", we will demonstrate that , with advanced machine learning techniques , we are able to remotely infer the entered pins on a mobile phone with high accuracy .",
    "in this section , we describe an advanced attack on user s pins by introducing pinlogger.js . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the attack approach , our program implementation , data collection , feature extraction , and neural network .",
    "we consider an attacker who wants to learn the user s pin tapped on a soft keyboard of a smartphone via side channel information .",
    "we consider ( digit - only ) pins since they are popular credentials used by users for many purposes such as unlocking phone , sim pin , nfc payments , bank cards , other banking services , gaming , and other personalised applications such as healthcare , insurance , etc .",
    "unlike similar works which have to gain the access through an installed app @xcite , our attack does not require any user permission .",
    "instead , we assume that the user has loaded the malicious web content in the form of an iframe , or another tab while working with the mobile browser as shown in figure [ attack ] . at this point ,",
    "the attack code has already started listening to the sensor sequences from the user s interaction with the phone .    in order to uncover when the user enters his pin , we need to classify his touch actions such as click , scroll , and zoom .",
    "we have already shown in touchsignatures @xcite that with the same sensor data and by applying classification algorithms , it is possible to effectively identify user s touch actions . here",
    ", we consider a scenario after the touch action classification . in other words",
    ", our attacker already knows that the user is entering his pin . moreover ,",
    "unless explicitly noted , we consider a generic attack scenario which is not user - dependant .",
    "this means that we do not need to train our machine learning algorithm with the same user as the subject of the attack .",
    "instead , we have a one - round training phase with data from multiple voluntary users , and use the obtained trained algorithm to output other users pins later .",
    "this approach has the benefit of not needing to trick individual users to collect their data for training .",
    "we implemented a web page with embedded javascript code in order to collect the data from voluntary users .",
    "our code registers two listeners on the window object to have access to orientation and motion data separately .",
    "the event handlers defined for these purposes are named _ deviceorientationevent _ and _ devicemotionevent _ respectively . on the client side , we developed a gui in html5 which shows random 4-digit pins to the users and activates a nummpad for them to enter the pins as shown in figure [ inputmethods ] .",
    "all sensor sequences are sent to the database along with their associated labels which are the digits of the entered pins .",
    "we implemented our server program using node.js ( nodejs.org ) .",
    "our code sends the orientation and motion sensor data of the mobile device to our nosql database using mongolab ( mongolab.com , web - based service for mongodb ) .",
    "when the event listener fires , it establishes a socket by using socket.io ( socket.io ) between the client and the server and constantly transmits the sensor data to the database .",
    "both node.js and mongodb ( as a document - oriented database ) are known for being capable of supporting data intensive applications in real time .    in the proof - of - concept implementation of the attack , we focus on working with active web pages , which allows us to easily identify the start of a touch action through the javascript access to the _ onkeydown _ event .",
    "a similar approach is adopted in other works : e.g. , touchlogger @xcite and taplogger @xcite . in an extended attack scenario ,",
    "a more complex segmentation process would be needed to identify the start and end of a touch action .",
    "this could be achieved by measuring the peak amplitudes of a signal , as done in @xcite .      following the approach of aviv et al .",
    "@xcite and spreitzer @xcite , we consider a set of 50 fixed pins with uniformly distributed digits .",
    "we created these pins in a way that all digits are repeated about the same time ( around 20 times ) .",
    "the data collection code is publicly available via github .",
    "technical details of the data collection process and the collected data are publicly available too .",
    "we conducted our user studies using chrome on an android device ( nexus 5 ) .",
    "the experiments and results are based on the collected data from 10 users , each entering all the 50 4-digit pins for 5 times .",
    "our voluntary participants were university students and staff and performed the experiments at university offices .",
    "we simply explained to them that all they needed was to enter a few pins shown in a web page .    in relation to the environmental setting for the data collection",
    ", we asked the users to remain sitting in a chair while working with the phone .",
    "we did not require our users to hold the phone in any particular mode ( portrait or landscape ) or work with it by using any specific input method ( using one or two hands ) .",
    "we let them choose their most comfortable posture for holding the phone and working with it as they do in their usual manner .",
    "while watching the users during the experiments , we noticed that all of our users used the phone in the portrait mode by default .",
    "users were either leaning their hands on the desk or freely keeping them in the air .",
    "we also observed the following input methods used by the users .    * holding the phone in one hand and entering the pin with the thumb of the same hand ( figure [ inputmethods ] , left ) . * holding the phone in one hand and entering the pin with the fingers of the other hand ( figure [ inputmethods ] , centre ) . * holding the phone with two hands and entering the pin with the thumbs or fingers of both hands ( figure [ inputmethods ] , right ) .    in the first two cases , users",
    "exchangeably used either their right hands or left hands in order to hold the phone . in order to simulate a real world data collection environment",
    ", we took the phone to each user s workspace and briefly explained the experiment to them , and let them complete the experiment without our supervision .",
    "all users found this way of data collection very easy and could finish the experiments without any difficulties .",
    "our participants were given each an amazon voucher ( worth  10 ) at the end for their participation .      in order to build the feature vector as the input to our classifier algorithm",
    ", we consider both time domain and frequency domain features .",
    "we improve our suggested feature vectors in @xcite by adding some more complex features such as the correlation between the measurements .",
    "this addition improves the results , as we will discuss in section [ eva ] . as discussed before ,",
    "12 different sequences obtained from the collected data include orientation ( ori ) , acceleration ( acc ) , acceleration - including - gravity ( accg ) , and rotation rate ( rotr ) with three sequences ( either x , y and z , or @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) for each sensor measurement . as a pre - processing step and in order to remove the effect of the initial position and orientation of the device , we subtract the initial value in each sequence from subsequent values in the sequence .",
    "we use these pre - processed sequences for feature extraction in time domain directly . in frequency domain",
    ", we apply the fast fourier transform ( fft ) on the pre - processed sequences and use the transformed sequences for feature extraction . in order to build our feature vector",
    ", first we obtain the maximum , minimum , and average values of each pre - processed and fft sequences .",
    "these statistical measurements give us @xmath6 features in the time domain , and the same number of features in the frequency domain .",
    "we also consider the total energy of each sequence in both time and frequency domains calculated as the sum of the squared sequence values , i.e. , @xmath7 which gives us 24 new features .",
    "the next set of features are in time domain and are based on the correlation between each pair of sequences in different axes .",
    "we have 4 different sequences ; ori , acc , accg , and rotr , each represented by 3 measurements .",
    "hence , we can calculate 6 different correlation values between the possible pairs ; ( ori , acc ) , ( ori , accg ) , ( ori , rotr ) , ( acc , accg ) , ( acc , rotr ) , and ( accg , rotr ) , each presented in a vector with 3 elements .",
    "we use the correlation coefficient function in order to calculate the similarity rate between the mentioned sequences .",
    "the correlation coefficient method is commonly used to compare the similarity of the shapes of two signals ( e.g. @xcite ) . given two sequences @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting covariance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the correlation coefficient is computed as below : @xmath11 the correlation coefficient of two vectors measures their linear dependence by using covariance . by adding these new 18 features , our feature vector consists of a total of 114 features .",
    "we apply a supervised machine learning algorithm by using an artificial neural network ( ann ) to solve this classification problem .",
    "the input of an ann system could be either raw data , or pre - processed data from the samples . in our case",
    ", we have preprocessed our samples by building a feature vector as described before . therefore , as input , our ann receives a set of 114 features for each sample . as explained before , we collected 5 samples per each 4-digit pin from 10 users . while reading the records , we realised that some of the pins have been entered wrongly by some users .",
    "this was expected since each user was required to enter 250 pins . since we recorded both expected and entered pins in our data collection , we could easily identify these pins and exclude them from our analysis .",
    "overall , out of 2500 records collected from 10 users , 12 of the pins were entered wrongly .",
    "hence we ended up with 2488 samples for our ann .",
    "the feature vectors are mapped to specific labels from a finite set : i.e. , 50 fixed random 4-digit pins .",
    "we train and validate our algorithm with two different subsets of our collected data , and test the neural network against a separate subset of the data .",
    "we train the network with 70% of our data , validate it with 15% of the records and test it with the remaining 15% of our data set .",
    "we use a pattern recognition / classifying network in matlab with one hidden layer and 1000 nodes .",
    "pattern recognition / classifying networks normally use a scaled conjugate gradient ( scg ) back - propagation algorithm for updating weight and bias values in training .",
    "scaled conjugate gradient is a fast supervised learning algorithm  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results of our attack on 4-digit pins in two different forms : multi - users mode , and same - user mode .",
    "we also train separate ann systems to learn individual digits of pins and compare these results with other works .",
    "the second column of table  [ allusers ] shows the accuracy of our ann trained with the data from all users . in this mode ,",
    "the results are based on training , validating , and testing our ann using the collected data from all of our 10 participants .",
    "as the table shows , in the first attempt pinlogger.js is able to infer the user s 4-digit pin correctly with accuracy of 74.43% , and as expected it gets better in further attempts . by comparison , a random attack can guess a pin from a set of 50 pins with the probability of 2% in the first attempt , and 6% in three attempts .    .pinlogger.js",
