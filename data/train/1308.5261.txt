    ", since there are three root sccs , three sensor nodes will have to be selected to achieve observability .",

    "the case in which symmetries are present , will be treated in detail in sec .",
    "the graphical approach is a powerful method to analyze and determine whether a system is observable or not . with this method one can select some of the states of a network to be monitored to collect information about the entire system . in many applications , it is often the case that one wants to reconstruct the structure of a network of coupled dynamical systems . frequently , the goal is not only that of estimating the states corresponding to the network nodes , but also those corresponding to the connections , which is important e.g. , in neural and genetic networks .",
    "faults occurring in large technological networks can be dynamically detected by monitoring the dynamics of the connections between the nodes , e.g. , a fault may affect the state of one or more connections @xcite .",

    "the time evolution of the connections can provide information on the environment , e.g. on the presence of obstacles @xcite . moreover , in the absence of information about the edge states , it is impossible to reconstruct the network from partial measurements of the nodes .",
    "hence , in a complex network , the two problems of identifying node states and edge states are typically intertwined .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    in this paper , we will explicitly take into account a situation for which the network states include both node states and edge states .",
    "we will generally assume , without loss of generality , that node states are vectors composed of several variables , @xmath38 , while edge states are scalars .",
    "we will assume to have access to a subset of these states ( i.e. , both a subset of the nodes and of the edge states ) and will analyze the conditions under which observability of the whole network is achieved .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    in the following sections , we will extend the ga method presented in @xcite and @xcite to the case that the states corresponding to the network connections are explicitly taken into account .",
    "the following two cases will be considered : static connections ( they do not evolve in time or they evolve in time independently of the network states but on a time scale that is much longer than the time scale on which the individual nodes evolve ) and adaptively evolving connections ( they respond to the dynamics of the network nodes ) . a typical example of such adaptive dynamics is synaptic plasticity in neural networks , which is a process by which neural activity can actively modify the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission @xcite .",
