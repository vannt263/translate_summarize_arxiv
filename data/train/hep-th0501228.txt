    "modern perturbative quantum field theory is mainly based on path integrals .",
    "basic objects are the correlation functions @xmath0 which are calculated as moments of the feynman path integral , i.e. @xmath1 relations to wightman fields or even to local algebras of observables are indirect and are not elaborated in typical cases .",
    "this fact leads to some severe problems . on the one hand side , concepts from the algebraic approach to quantum field theory",
    "can not be easily applied to perturbatively constructed models .",
    "this lead to the prejudice that these concepts are irrelevant for physically interesting models as long as these can be constructed only at the level of formal perturbation theory . on the other side , the path integral",
    "approach is intrinsically nonlocal ; therefore difficulties arise for the treatment of infrared problems and of finite temperatures , and theories on curved back grounds or with external fields can not properly be formulated . in algebraic quantum field theory ,",
    "concepts for dealing with these problems have been developed @xcite .",
    "we therefore started a program for a perturbative construction of the net of local algebras of observables @xcite .",
    "there already exists a local formulation of renormalization due to epstein and glaser @xcite and based on older ideas of stckelberg and bogoliubov @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this method compared to other schemes of renormalization are that it can be formulated entirely in position space , that it is mathematically well elaborated and that it gives a direct construction of operators .",
    "it is , however , not equally well developed from the computational point of view , the rle of the renormalization group is not yet fully established and , even worse , the application to non - abelian gauge theories is not evident .",
    "in particular the last problem was partially resolved by the zrich school @xcite , who also developed many new tools for doing concrete calculations in the epstein - glaser framework .    the starting point for our approach",
    "is bogoliubov s definition of interacting fields @xmath2 in this contribution , we will first formulate axioms for interacting fields , will then construct solutions , thereafter discuss the renormalization group and will finally describe the arising local nets and local fields .",
    "we consider polynomial functionals of a classical scalar ( @xmath3 ) field @xmath4 on @xmath5-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath6 here the smearing functions @xmath7 are assumed to be distributions with compact support in @xmath8 variables with wave front set @xmath9 e.  g. @xmath10 with @xmath11 , so @xmath12 .    a functional @xmath13 is called local , if @xmath14 , with the total diagonal @xmath15 let us first describe the classical free theory",
    ": there the field equation @xmath16 generates an ideal in the algebra of functionals @xmath13 ( with respect to pointwise multiplication ) .",
    "the poisson bracket of the classical model is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the commutator function of the free scalar field with mass @xmath19 .    for quantization",
    "we follow the recipes of deformation quantization and define an associative product @xmath20 by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the 2-point function of the free scalar field .",
    "the poisson bracket as well as the @xmath20-product vanish on the ideal generated by the field equation and can therefore be defined also on the quotient algebra . in the classical case one",
    "obtains the poisson algebra of the classical field theory , in the quantum case one obtains the algebra of wick polynomials on fock space , and the formula for the @xmath20-product translates into wick s theorem . for the treatment of interactions , it is however preferable not to go to the quotient but to formulate everything on the original space ( off shell formalism ) .",
    "this introduces some redundancy which will be very useful for the solution of cohomological problems , as for instance in the determination of counter terms in the lagrangian which compensate changes in the renormalization prescription .",
    "we now turn to the characterization of retarded interacting field functionals .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 be local functionals of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a formal power series with vanishing term of zeroth order .",
    "we associate to the pair @xmath26 a formal power series of functionals @xmath27 which we interpret as the functional @xmath13 of the interacting retarded field under the influence of the interaction @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the expansion parameter of the formal power series .",
    "we require the following properties :    initial condition : : :    @xmath30 causality : : :    @xmath31    +    if @xmath32 takes place later than @xmath13 .",
    "glaser - lehmann - zimmermann : : :    @xcite @xmath33_\\star =              \\frac{d}{d\\mu}(f_{s+\\mu g}- g_{s+\\mu f})|_{\\mu=0 } \\ .\\ ] ]    in addition , we require    unitarity : : :    @xmath34 covariance : : :    let @xmath35 denote the natural action of the poincar    group on the space of functionals @xmath13",
    ". then    @xmath36 for all poincar    transformations @xmath37 .",
    "field independence : : :    the association of local functionals to their interacting counterpart    should not explicitly depend on @xmath4 ,    @xmath38    for test functions @xmath39 . scaling : : :    there is a natural scaling transformation ,    @xmath40 , on the space of functionals which scales    also the mass in the @xmath20-product from @xmath19 to    @xmath41 .",
    "but the limit @xmath42    is singular because of scaling anomalies .",
    "this holds already for the    free theory ( in even dimensions ) .",
    "+    instead : introduce an auxiliary mass parameter @xmath43 and    transform the @xmath20-product to an equivalent one which is    smooth in the mass @xmath19 . require a smooth @xmath19    dependence in the prescription @xmath44    ( in particular at @xmath45 ( one - sided ) ) such that    @xmath46 , scaled by @xmath47 , is    in every order of perturbation theory a polynomial of    @xmath48 .",
    "we make the ansatz that the interacting field is a formal power series in the interaction , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an ( @xmath51)-linear functional , symmetric in the first @xmath8 entries ( called retarded product ) .    the inductive construction of retarded products can be done in an analogous way as the construction of time ordered products in the epstein - glaser method and was elaborated already ( in a slightly different form ) by steinmann @xcite . in a first step",
    "we represent the local functionals as fields smeared with a test function , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an element of the space @xmath54 of all polynomials of @xmath4 and its derivatives , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a test function . using this representation ,",
    "the retarded products can be represented as distributions @xmath57 with values in the space of functionals of @xmath4 . with",
    "that the inductive construction can be done by first constructing the retarded products outside of the total diagonal @xmath58 ( [ diagonal ] ) in terms of retarded products with less arguments and then by extending them to the full space ( in the sense of distributions ) .",
    "perturbative renormalization is precisely this extension problem .",
    "a difficulty with this procedure is that the representation of local functionals by fields is non - unique , e.g. one finds by partial integration @xmath59    therefore it was suggested by stora @xcite that one should impose an additional requirement , termed the * action ward identity * ( awi ) , which guarantees that the retarded products depend only on the functionals , but not on the way they are represented as smeared fields .",
    "this amounts to the requirement , that the retarded products commute with derivatives , @xmath60 such a relation can not hold if the arguments of the retarded products are on - shell fields ( i.e.  satisfy the free field equations ) . in the off - shell formalism adopted here ,",
    "however , one can actually show that there are no anomalies for the awi . namely one may introduce * balanced * fields , as was done recently for the purpose of non - equilibrium quantum field theory by buchholz , ojima and roos @xcite",
    ": the balanced fields form that subspace @xmath61 of all local fields @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is a polynomial ) which arises when @xmath63 is restricted to depend only on the differences of variables @xmath64 .",
    "the argument relies on    every local functional @xmath13 is of the form @xmath65 with a unique test function @xmath56 with values in the space of balanced fields .    _",
    "existence : _ every symmetric polynomial @xmath66 in @xmath8 variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 may be written in the form @xmath69 with polynomials @xmath70 in the center of mass momentum @xmath71 and symmetric polynomials @xmath72 in the relative momentum @xmath73 .",
    "every local functional of @xmath8-th order in @xmath4 is of the form @xmath74 @xmath75 with test functions @xmath76 . by partial integration",
    "we find @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "_ uniqueness : _ to show uniqueness let @xmath80 with the balanced fields @xmath81 , where @xmath72 are _ symmetrical _ polynomials ( with respect to permutations of @xmath82 ) .",
    "then @xmath83 implies that @xmath84 since the center of mass coordinate @xmath85 and the relative coordinate @xmath86 are independent , this implies @xmath87 hence @xmath88 .    by using this lemma",
    "the awi can be fulfilled by the following procedure .",
    "one first extends @xmath89 only for @xmath90 . since , by induction , the awi holds outside of @xmath58 , one",
    "may then define the extension for general fields @xmath91 by using the awi and linearity in the fields .",
    "the extension of @xmath50 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 is generically non - unique .",
    "hence , there is an ambiguity in the construction of interacting fields , which is well understood : it can be described in terms of the stckelberg - petermann renormalization group @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the elements of @xmath94 are analytic invertible maps @xmath95 which map the space of formal power series of local functionals , which start with the first term , into itself such that @xmath96 and @xmath97 if @xmath98 . here",
    "the lagrangians are of the form @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "derivatives are defined by @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 is of the form @xmath104 with linear maps @xmath105 which are lorentz invariant , maintain homogeneous scaling of the fields and do not explicitly depend on @xmath4 .    the main theorem of renormalization @xcite amounts to the following relation between interacting field functionals for two renormalization prescriptions @xmath106 and @xmath107 which both satisfy the mentioned axioms :    there is a unique element @xmath108of the renormalization group @xmath94 such that @xmath109    conversely , given a renormalization prescription @xmath110 satisfying the axioms and an arbitrary @xmath111 , equation ( [ mainthm ] ) gives a new renormalization prescription @xmath112 which fulfills also the axioms .",
    "we first define the algebra @xmath113 of observables within the region @xmath114 for a ( fixed ) interaction @xmath115 with compact support .",
    "this algebra is generated by elements @xmath27 , @xmath98 with local functionals @xmath13 fulfilling @xmath116 . in @xcite it has been found that the algebraic structure of @xmath117 is independent of the values of @xmath115 outside of @xmath114 :      we now want to construct the algebras for a not necessarily compactly supported lagrangian @xmath115 ( i.e.  we perform the so called algebraic adiabatic limit ) . for this purpose",
    "we consider the bundle of algebras @xmath123 over the space of compactly supported lagrangians @xmath118 which coincide within @xmath114 with the given lagrangian @xmath115 .",
    "a section @xmath124 of this bundle is called covariantly constant if for all automorphisms @xmath125 satisfying ( [ adlim ] ) the following relation holds : @xmath126 so in particular the interacting field functionals @xmath110 are ( by definition ) covariantly constant sections .",
    "the covariantly constant sections now generate the local algebras associated to the interaction @xmath115 .    to define the net of local algebras one has to specify , for @xmath127 , the injections @xmath128 let @xmath129 .",
    "then @xmath130 is the section which is obtained from the section @xmath131 by restriction to lagrangians which coincide with @xmath115 on the larger region .",
    "clearly these injections satisfy the compatibility relation required for nets : @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , the net satisfies local commutativity and , if @xmath115 is lorentz invariant , it is covariant under the poincar group @xcite .",
    "the next step is the construction of local fields associated to the local net .",
    "following @xcite , a local field associated to the net is defined as a family of distributions @xmath134 with values in @xmath113 such that @xmath135 if the test function @xmath136 has support contained in @xmath137 .",
    "in particular all classical fields @xmath138 induce local fields @xmath139 by the sections @xmath140 where @xmath118 coincides with @xmath115 within @xmath114 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "it is an open question whether there are other local fields .",
    "the answer would amount to the determination of the borchers class for perturbative quantum field theories .        1 .",
