    "given that the primary deviation in the near - infrared brightness of 2mass  j0532 + 8246 occurs in the spectral region in which condensate opacity should be dominant , these results provide further support for the idea that condensate formation is inhibited in low - temperature metal - poor atmospheres .",

    "<S> its kinematics indicate a @xmath5110  myr , retrograde galactic orbit which is both eccentric ( 3 @xmath6 r @xmath6 8.5  kpc ) and extends well away from the plane ( @xmath7z = @xmath02  kpc ) , consistent with membership in the inner halo population . the relatively bright @xmath8-band magnitude of 2mass  j05325346 + 8246465 implies significantly reduced opacity in the 1.2  @xmath9 region , consistent with inhibited condensate formation as previously proposed . </S>",
