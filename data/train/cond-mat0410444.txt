    "earthquakes constitute an extremely complex spatio - temporal phenomenon , with the deformation and sudden rupture of some parts of the earth s crust driven by convective motion in the mantle , and the radiation of energy in the form of seismic waves . despite this complexity",
    ", certain characteristics of seismicity can be captured by simple ( empirical ) self - similar laws .",
    "thinking of complexity in the sense of the physics of complex systems ( e.g. @xcite ) , one might argue that the observed scaling laws are in fact the hallmark of the crust being a complex system ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for example , in a specified area covering many geological faults and over a given ( large ) time window the number of earthquakes @xmath2 with a magnitude @xmath3 larger than some threshold @xmath4 is given by the gutenberg - richter law ( gr ) @xcite which states that @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the strain released during an earthquake is directly related to the moment @xmath7 of the earthquake ( by definition @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the shear modulus of the rock , @xmath10 the area of the fault break , and @xmath11 is the mean displacement across the fault @xcite ) which in turn increases exponentially with the magnitude ( @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite ) , the probability distribution of the released strain turns out to be a power law , precisely the imprint of scale - free behavior .    this self - similarity exhibited by gr , the independence of stress drop on magnitude",
    "@xcite , and recent laboratory measurements of coseismic slip resistance @xcite are good evidence that the physics of earthquake rupture is the same for small and large earthquakes .",
    "it is still controversial if this is different for the largest earthquakes ( see @xcite for a discussion ) because of the finite thickness of the brittle layer .",
    "another example of a self - similar law in seismicity is omori s law @xcite .",
    "it states that immediately following a main shock there is a sequence of aftershocks whose frequency @xmath15 decays with time @xmath16 after the main shock as @xmath17 for @xmath18 with @xmath19 and fault- and magnitude - dependant constants @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . an obvious difficulty with omori s law is the identification of aftershocks especially because aftershocks are not caused by a different relaxation mechanism than main shocks @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite proposed a solution based on a metric measuring the correlation between any two earthquakes .    while the existence and limitations of gr and omori s law are well tested and accepted , much less",
    "is known about other earthquake statistics and their ( universal ) properties . here",
    ", we will focus on the distribution of time intervals between successive earthquakes above a certain magnitude in a given area which is an important quantity characterizing earthquake occurrence . in the past , many different possibilities have been proposed for these waiting times , from totally random to periodic occurrence of large earthquakes .",
    "the most extended view is that of two separated processes , one for main shocks , which ought to follow a poisson distribution @xcite ( or not @xcite ) , and an independent process to generate aftershocks .",
    "very recently , @xcite suggested that waiting time distributions can be described by a power - law with a cutoff for large waiting times which scales with the size of the considered area and magnitude threshold , indicating a generalized scaling behavior .",
    "@xcite further proposed that the `` cutoff '' is rather a transition between two different power laws .    here",
    ", we show that yet another power law regime exists for small waiting times .",
    "our results also provide clear evidence that the additional transition point scales differently with area size .",
    "we attribute this to the generic structure of the epicenters spatial distribution which is shown not to form a simple fractal but to have a rather complicated structure , possibly multifractal as proposed in @xcite .",
    "to analyze the distribution of waiting times , we follow @xcite and take the perspective of statistical physics by neglecting tectonic features and any classification of earthquakes as main shocks or aftershocks .",
    "we consider spatial areas and their subdivision into square cells of length @xmath23 in kilometers . for each of these cells ,",
    "only events with magnitude above a certain threshold @xmath4 are taken into account . in this way",
    ", we obtain the waiting times @xmath24 in seconds between successive events at time @xmath25 and @xmath26 in each @xmath27-cell . combining the waiting times from all cells , the probability density function of the waiting times @xmath28 can be estimated .",
    "analyzing data from southern california , @xcite proposed the following scaling law @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and a scaling function @xmath34 depending only on the combined argument @xmath35 . for small arguments , @xmath34 is approximately constant not affecting the power - law @xmath36 behavior ; for large arguments , @xmath34 decays rapidly and in such a way that it seems to be consistent with a different power - law @xcite .",
    "while there are good arguments that @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 does _ not _ correspond to omori s @xmath39 as originally claimed by @xcite since the decay of the rate of aftershocks determines the corresponding _ all - return time _ distribution but not the waiting ( or first - return ) time distribution .",
    "it is an open question if @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ ptau ] corresponds to the fractal dimension @xmath41 of the epicenter distribution : @xcite has found @xmath42 for southern california .",
    "it is also unclear if the analysis by @xcite has suffered from the incompleteness of their data for small magnitudes ( see * ? ? ?",
    ".    to test the general validity of the proposed scaling law ( eq .  [ ptau ] ) and to clarify the scaling with @xmath23 , we study two earthquake catalogues  one from southern california ( @xmath43 , 19158 events ) and one from southern iceland ( @xmath44 , 16286 events ) . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the coordinates of the polygon are @xmath45 . based on @xcite , the reporting of events",
    "is assumed to be homogeneous from january 1984 to december 2000 and complete at the level of @xmath46 . for @xmath44 , it was found that within @xmath47 the reporting of events was homogeneous from july 1991 to december 1995 and complete at the level of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the average waiting time differs by a factor of @xmath49 from @xmath44 to @xmath43 .    for @xmath43 , we find that indeed @xmath28 decays as a power law with exponent @xmath50 over some range of @xmath51 .",
    "this can be deduced from fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 where @xmath28 is plotted in terms of rescaled coordinates for different values of @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath52-axis is chosen as @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and the @xmath55-axis represents @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the constant regime in fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 corresponds to a power - law decay of @xmath28 with exponent @xmath38 .",
    "yet , fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2 also show that there is another , previously unnoticed power - law regime for smaller values of @xmath52 : the power - law increase for the rescaled coordinates implies that the waiting time distributions decay with exponent @xmath57 .",
    "1 further shows that there is a rather sharp transition between the two power - law regimes characterized by @xmath38 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "moreover , for @xmath59 , all data collapse nicely onto a single well - defined curve for @xmath60 and over 6 orders of magnitude including the transition points .",
    "this data collapse implies in particular that the location of the transition point @xmath61 between the @xmath38- and @xmath58-regime depends on @xmath51 , @xmath4 and @xmath23 only through the combined variable @xmath52 with @xmath62 .",
    "for example , keeping @xmath63 fixed , we find @xmath64h for @xmath65 km and @xmath66h for @xmath67 km . extrapolating to @xmath68 , for instance , it follows @xmath69h for @xmath70 km .",
    "however , the data do not collapse onto a single curve for @xmath71 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) implying that no single scaling function @xmath34 exists .",
    "thus , the proposed scaling law given in eq .",
    "[ ptau ] can not be strictly valid .",
    "this is further confirmed by varying @xmath40 . already for @xmath72 which was used in @xcite , the data do not collapse onto a single curve for _ small values _ of @xmath52 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the situation is even worse as fig",
    ".  2 shows . yet , with the exception of the curves for the smallest values of @xmath23 , @xmath67 km and @xmath74 km , the data seem to collapse for @xmath75 and over 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "since the estimates of @xmath28 for large arguments and small values of @xmath23 might suffer from insufficient length of the data set leading to an underestimation of the actual @xmath55 values , a well - defined cutoff or transition point @xmath76 between the power - law regime characterized by @xmath38 and the regime for larger arguments showing a rapid decay ( which might or might not be a power law ) might exist .",
    "in contrast to @xmath61 , @xmath76 depends on the combined variable @xmath52 with a different @xmath40 , namely @xmath77 , and , thus , @xmath61 and @xmath76 scale differently with @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , differences in @xmath23 are important and can not be captured by a single exponent @xmath40 .    for @xmath44",
    ", we obtain similar results which are shown in fig .",
    "3 together with data from @xmath43 for comparison : for @xmath59 and @xmath78 and for @xmath79 , the different curves collapse nicely over 5 orders of magnitude despite large variations in @xmath23 and @xmath4 and their different geographical origin . in particular , within the statistical errors , there are no differences between @xmath44 and @xmath43 in terms of @xmath38 as well as @xmath58 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath80 and @xmath1 are universal .",
    "the data collapse further confirms that @xmath28 depends on @xmath4 only through the combined argument @xmath81 implying that a change in @xmath4 leads only to a rather simple rescaling of @xmath51 .",
    "besides , both for @xmath44 and @xmath43 we find @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 scales with @xmath4 and according to gr : @xmath83 here , @xmath84 does not only depend on @xmath23 but also on the specific geographical area as fig",
    ".  3 shows .",
    "significant differences for large values of @xmath52 between the curves with the same @xmath23 but from different geographical regions are present .",
    "the waiting time distributions from @xmath43 show a very sharp transition at and a much steeper decay for large arguments than the ones from @xmath44 .",
    "these findings are evidence that even a modified version of eq .",
    "[ ptau ]  incorporating the additional exponent @xmath58 , for example  with a _ universal _",
    "function @xmath34 does not exist . the data from @xmath44 , similar to those from @xmath43 ,",
    "also do not collapse for large @xmath52 despite identical @xmath4 .",
    "thus , a simple scaling of @xmath28 with @xmath23 involving a single dimension @xmath40 does generally not exist . as we show below",
    ", this is due to the fact that the distribution of epicenters does not form a simple fractal .",
    "any homogeneous ( mono-)fractal is completely described by the capacity dimension @xmath41 alone . in the case of heterogeneous ( multi-)fractals",
    ", @xmath41 describes only one , albeit dominant , feature of the set as can be seen from the generalized definition of fractal dimension ( the spectrum of generalized dimensions @xcite ) @xmath85 here , @xmath86 are the generalized @xmath87th moments of the probabilities @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is the number of events found in the @xmath90th cell of size @xmath23 , and @xmath91 is the total number .",
    "@xmath41 is recovered for @xmath92 .",
    "two other prominent fractal dimensions , the information and correlation dimension , result for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "higher moments increasingly emphasize densely populated , i.e. seismically more active , areas of the set . @xmath95 may in principle be obtained for any value of @xmath87 , especially desirable for negative @xmath87 which would characterize the scaling properties of regions of low seismic activity . yet , due to the relative sparsity of earthquake data and its relative inaccuracy , we restrain our analysis to @xmath96 which will nevertheless allow us to judge the non - uniformity of the epicenter distribution . to obtain most reliable results ,",
    "we base our numerical approach on a generalization of the correlation - integral method as proposed by @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath95 vs. @xmath87 for @xmath43 and for @xmath97 .",
    "inset is a double - logarithmic plot of @xmath98 vs. @xmath23 for the first three generalized dimensions and for @xmath99 , the highest moment considered .",
    "@xmath95 is estimated from the respective slopes by fitting a straight line over the appropriate scaling region which ranges from about 1.5 to 180 km in this case , sufficiently large to believe in the fractal nature of the data .",
    "the scaling region holds well even for @xmath99 .",
    "we find @xmath100 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and , effectively , @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is a measure for the fractal dimension of the most densely populated vicinities in the seismicity distribution .",
    "most notably , @xmath41 and @xmath104 are identical within the statistical errors to the values of @xmath40 for @xmath76 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that @xmath28 is dominated by the most densely populated vicinities for small waiting times and the dominant feature of the spatial distribution of epicenters captured by the fractal dimension @xmath41 only prevails for larger waiting times .",
    "this is exactly what is expected based on the associated difference in the local rates of seismic activity .",
    "taking @xmath105 as a measure of inhomogeneity , we conclude that the seismicity distribution in @xmath43 is definitely heterogeneous and , thus , does not form a simple mono - fractal . for @xmath44 ,",
    "we reach the same conclusion .",
    "the quality of our estimate of @xmath28 depends on several aspects : first , on the completeness of the earthquake catalogue .",
    "even if a catalogue is considered to be complete above @xmath106 , certain events are missing : directly after a large earthquake many small events are lost in the seismic coda of the proceeding event .",
    "hence , short waiting times will be underestimated and the error in @xmath107 can be as large as the maximum `` deadtime '' after an earthquake .",
    "we , thus , have excluded waiting times less than one minute .",
    "second , the magnitude of a given earthquake can vary as comparisons of different definitions of magnitude show . yet , a detailed analysis of the data from @xmath44 shows that @xmath28 does not depend significantly on the definition of magnitude chosen .",
    "third , while errors in the epicenter location can certainly lead to a wrong cell association and , thus , induce errors in the estimate of @xmath28 , the ( implicit ) assumption that earthquakes are a point process is much more severe . as shown by @xcite , it is a good approximation to relate the moment of an earthquake to the area of rupture by @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 increases with the magnitude of the earthquake ; for example , @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 @xcite . fortunately , for the vast majority of earthquakes @xmath113 is significantly less than the values of @xmath23 studied here .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath44 since the rate of occurrence of the largest earthquakes is rather small , also preventing domination of the statistics by large events .",
    "we are , thus , confident that our estimate of @xmath28 is reliable and the scaling regime with exponent @xmath58 for arguments smaller than @xmath61 is not an artifact of our analysis .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the scaling of @xmath61 and @xmath76 with @xmath23 can be directly related to the spectrum of generalized dimensions , namely @xmath114 and @xmath41 , respectively . while this directly implies that the proposed scaling law given in eq .",
    "[ ptau ] is not valid , the comparison between vastly different scales and different geological areas suggests that @xmath38 , @xmath58 and @xmath61 are universal .",
    "our results further suggest that even if a power - law regime exists for arguments larger than @xmath76 as proposed in @xcite , it might not be universal .",
