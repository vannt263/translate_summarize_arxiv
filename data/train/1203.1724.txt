    "nowadays the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin symmetric nuclear matter is now relatively well determined mainly by studying collective flows in heavy - ion collisions and nuclear giant monopole resonances @xcite .",
    "the major remaining uncertainty about the eos of symmetric nuclear matter is due to our poor knowledge about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite , which is crucial for understanding many interesting issues in both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite . and",
    "it is also crucial in connection with the structure of neutron stars and the dynamical evolution of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "nowadays considerable progress has been made recently in determining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "however , much more work is still needed to probe the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "currently , to pin down the symmetry energy , the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university , the gesellschaft fuer schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) at darmstadt , the rikagaku kenkyusho ( riken , the institute of physical and chemical research ) of japan , and the cooler storage ring ( csr ) in lanzhou are planning to do related experiments to probe the symmetry energy .",
    "the neutron - proton differential transverse flow and the difference of neutron and proton flows are both sensitive to the symmetry energy @xcite , but the used transport models always adopt different momentum dependent interactions among nucleons .",
    "the importance of the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential on the two kinds of nuclear flows was seldom mentioned .",
    "considering the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential is quite controversial @xcite , in the framework of the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling- uhlenbeck transport model , we find that , besides the ratio of @xmath3 @xcite , the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential affects the neutron - proton differential transverse flow more evidently than the difference of neutron and proton transverse flows as well as the difference of proton and neutron elliptic flows .",
    "it is thus better to probe the symmetry energy by using the difference of nucleonic transverse ( or elliptic ) flows .",
    "the present study is based on the ibuu04 transport model @xcite .",
    "the initial neutron and proton density distributions of the projectile and target are obtained by using the relativistic mean field theory .",
    "although nuclear flow may be affected by the initializations of colliding nuclei @xcite , our main results in the present studies are not sensitive to the initializations of target and projectile nuclei .",
    "the experimental free - space nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering cross sections and the in - medium nn cross sections can be used optionally . in the present work , we did not use the isospin - dependent in - medium nn elastic cross sections from the scaling model according to nucleon effective masses @xcite , although it is similar to the brueckner approach calculations @xcite .",
    "this is because the momentum - independent symmetry potential ( mid ) can not use the isospin - dependent in - medium nn elastic cross sections from the scaling model according to nucleon effective masses .",
    "thus all the studies here optionally use the experimental free - space nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering cross sections for consistence . for the inelastic cross sections people use the experimental data from free space nn collisions since the in - medium inelastic nn cross sections are still very much controversial .",
    "the total and differential cross sections for all other particles are taken either from experimental data or obtained by using the detailed balance formula . in the model , besides nucleons , @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances as well as pions and their isospin - dependent dynamics are included .",
    "the isospin dependent phase - space distribution functions of the particles involved are solved by using the test - particle method numerically .",
    "the isospin - dependence of pauli blockings for fermions is also considered .",
    "the momentum - dependent single nucleon potential ( mdi ) adopted here is @xcite@xmath6 in the above equation , @xmath7 is the isospin asymmetry parameter , @xmath8 is the baryon density and @xmath9 are the neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 for neutron ( proton ) and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the phase - space distribution function at coordinate @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 were set by reproducing the momentum - dependent potential @xmath19 predicted by the gogny hartree - fock and/or the brueckner - hartree - fock calculations , the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy of about @xmath20 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the propagations of nucleon are according to hamilton s equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge of particle , @xmath25 is the coulomb field of particle felt .",
    "the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at normal density is set to be @xmath26 mev . according to essentially all microscopic model calculations",
    ", the eos for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be expressed as @xmath27where @xmath28 is the energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath29 is the nuclear symmetry energy . with the single particle potential @xmath19 , for a given value @xmath30 , one can readily calculate the symmetry energy @xmath29 as a function of density . because the purpose of present studies is just to see how large the effect of momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential on the transverse and elliptic flows , we let the variable @xmath30 be @xmath31 , since the ibuu04 model gives a super - soft symmetry energy at higher densities @xcite .",
    "in fact , behavior of nuclear symmetry energy at supra - densities is still in controversy .",
    "the main characteristic of the present single particle is the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential , which has evident effect on energetic free @xmath32 ratio in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the present studies , to show the effects of the momentum dependence of symmtry potential , we kept the isoscalar potential fixed while changing the symmetry potential from the momentum dependent symmetry potential to the momentum independent symmetry potential and keep the symmetry energy fixed @xcite .",
    "[ symp ] shows the momentum dependent symmetry potential ( md ) and the momentum independent symmetry potential ( mid ) from the gogny interaction .",
    "we can see that at higher densities strength of the momentum independent symmetry potential ( mid ) is always larger than that of the momentum dependent symmetry potential . in the following ,",
    "we give our results of the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential on nuclear transverse and elliptic flows at higher densities ( the density reached in the @xmath0sn+@xmath1sn at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon is about 2 times saturation density @xcite ) .",

    "it is seen the case with momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential causes lower neutron to proton ratio , whereas the case without momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential causes higher neutron to proton ratio , especially for nucleons at large rapidities . because the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential decreases the strength of nuclear symmetry potential at high densities or high nucleonic momenta as shown in fig .",
    "the small symmetry potential decreases the free neutron to proton ratio @xcite . from this plot",
    ", we can see that while using the neutron to proton ratio n / p of free nucleons to probe the symmetry energy , one should keep in mind that this observable is sensitive to the the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential used , and thus may cause uncertainties while compared with the experimental data .",

    "we can see that without ( with ) momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential , the strength of the nucleon flow ( especially neutron flow ) increases ( decreases ) .",
    "this is understandable since the momentum independence of nuclear symmetry potential overall increases the strength of nuclear symmetry potential as shown in fig .",
    "[ symp ] , thus neutrons are repelled more strongly than the case with the momentum dependent symmetry potential . from fig .",
    "[ sflow ] we can also see that effect of the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential on the proton flow is less evident owing to the coulomb potential added on protons .",

    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ npflow ] ) that the constructed neutron - proton differential transverse flow depends not only on the proton flow and neutron flow but also on their relative multiplicities .",
    "therefore the neutron - proton differential transverse flow is not simply the difference of the neutron and proton transverse flows , it in fact depends also on the isospin fractionation at the rapidity @xmath37 . if neutrons and protons have the same average transverse momentum in the reaction plane but different multiplicities in each rapidity bin , i.e. , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , then eq .
