    "the impact of massive stars on the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium is of critical interest , particularly in regard to dwarf galaxies . in low mass galaxies ,",
    "the combined energy of stellar winds and supernova ( sn ) explosions can lead to the blow - out or blow - away of not only the hot metal - enriched gas from the sne themselves , but also a significant fraction of the host galaxy s interstellar medium @xcite . in the most dramatic cases , starbursts in dwarf galaxies have produced massive outflows of warm and hot ionized gas as seen in large - scale h@xmath0 filaments and x - ray emitting winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even in the absence of large - scale outflows , feedback from massive stars can dramatically affect the kinematics and distribution of the ism in galaxies as suggested by the large number of holes in the h  i distributions in nearby dwarf galaxies such as holmberg ii @xcite , ic 2574 @xcite , the magellanic clouds @xcite , and ic 10 @xcite .",
    "while there is a great deal of interest in understanding the impact of starbursts on the ism and evolution of dwarf galaxies , the question of how such starbursts are triggered in the first place remains controversial .",
    "some investigations find that a merger or interaction with gas - rich ( dwarf ) companions or massive gas clouds may trigger starbursts in these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other studies claim a lack of detected companions and suggest stochastic , self - propagating star formation or other internal triggers , especially for off - center star formation sites and the activity in low - surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc  1569 ( ugc  3056 , arp  210 , vii  zw  16 ) is one of the most actively star - forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this gas - rich dwarf galaxy is one of the few nearby dwarfs , in which violent star formation is , or has been , taking place .",
    "table  1 contains some of its basic properties . as a member of the ic  342/maffei group ,",
    "it is located close to the galactic plane at a distance of about 2  mpc ( @xmath1  mpc according to @xcite , @xmath2  mpc according to @xcite ) , hence 1= 9.7  pc .",
    "ngc  1569 is fairly isolated .",
    "except for the dwarf galaxy ugca  92 at a projected distance of 42  kpc there are no near neighbors ( karachentsev , tikhonov & sazonova 1994 ) .",
    "there are several indications that ngc  1569 is in an evolved phase of a starburst : it hosts numerous h@xmath0 filaments , which extend far out into the halo ( hunter , hawley & gallagher 1993 ) ; it has a distinct cut - off in its synchrotron spectrum @xcite , extended soft x - ray emission and a starburst - driven metal - rich galactic wind ( martin , kobulnicky & heckman 2002 ) .",
    "two very bright super - star clusters located in the disk ( sscs a and b , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear to be associated with a hole in the  distribution @xcite and with a local minimum in the emission of the warm molecular gas as traced by the co line emission @xcite .",
    "because of its state as a ( post-)starburst galaxy , ngc  1569 is an excellent laboratory in which to study the impact of massive stars on their environment .",
    "its proximity means that we can study feedback on spatial scales of @xmath3  pc with the resolution available on modern interferometers . here",
    "we focus on the distribution and kinematics of the  in ngc  1569 in order to map the connection between the energy input of violent star formation , the outflow of warm and hot gas , and the properties of the neutral ism .",
    "we also explore the relationship between the previously identified neighboring gas cloud @xcite and the recent star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the  distribution of ngc  1569 was first mapped by @xcite and it has a prominent western arm , which extends southward from the disk and is located far west of the h@xmath0 arm . within the bright  ridge north of the optical center of the galaxy , @xcite detected a prominent hole , about 100  pc in diameter , coincident with ssc  a. a kinematical study of the  emission by @xcite suggests that the gaseous inner disk ( @xmath4 ) is quite disturbed .",
    "this picture is supported by the study of @xcite , who searched for radio supernovae ( rsne ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the vicinity of the super - star clusters and found only a few non - thermal sources in the outer regions of an area about 300  pc in diameter around the sscs .",
    "our  observations , which have an angular resolution higher than those reported in the past , aimed at scrutinizing the morphology and kinematics of the diffuse gas , with an attempt to identify further traces of the impact of the past starburst . at the same time , our study of the large - scale  distribution and kinematics has uncovered possible evidence for a trigger of this burst .",
    "2 describes the observations and data reduction , also addressing the problem of the galactic foreground emission and the issue of missing flux . in sect .  3 ,",
    "the detailed  distribution and kinematics of the disk of ngc  1569 are discussed and compared with the available h@xmath0   morphology and velocity information . in sect .  4",
    ", we present the faint  halo structure around ngc  1569 and discuss its possible origin and the resulting implications for the starburst . sect .",
    "5 summarizes our results .",
    "the  observations were carried out with the very large array ( vla ) in the b - configuration ( 14 hours of observing time in april 1993 ) , in the c - configuration ( 7 hours in june 1993 ) , and in the d - configuration ( 3 hours in september 1992 ) .",
    "we chose a correlator bandwidth of 1.56mhz and applied hanning smoothing online , which resulted in a data cube of 127 channels with a velocity resolution of @xmath5 .",
    "the data were calibrated with the standard phase calibrator 0614 + 607 and the flux calibrator 0137 + 331 .",
    "we then subtracted the continuum emission in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane using the emission - free channels on both ends of the spectrum not affected by galactic foreground emission .",
    "for the deconvolution and imaging of our data , the standard aips task imagr was applied .",
    "we tried several weighting schemes by varying the weighting parameter robust @xcite , thus producing image cubes with about natural weighting ( robust = 5 ) , or with a scheme between uniform and natural weighting ( robust = @xmath8 ) . from these cubes , we chose two data sets for our analysis : a high - resolution cube ( robust = 1 ) with a beam width of @xmath9 fwhm and an rms noise level of @xmath10 in the channel maps corresponding to an hi column density of @xmath11 , which emphasizes the small - scale structure in the disk of ngc  1569 , and a low - resolution cube ( robust = 5 ) with a beam width of @xmath12 fwhm and a noise level of @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath13 , which is sensitive to the large - scale low - column density features .",
    "each cube was cleaned down to the noise level .",
    "the filtering nature of the interferometer works to our advantage : by combining vla observations taken in the b- , c- , and d - configuration , our data include structures from @xmath14 ( b - array ) to @xmath15 ( d - array ) .",
    "thus , all of the large - scale structure except for possibly existing extended halo features physically connected with ngc  1569 will be present in the interferometric data , while much of the unwanted large - scale galactic foreground structure is efficiently filtered out .",
    "a caveat remains , in the sense that if there are small - scale galactic features in the line of sight toward the dwarf galaxy with velocities similar to those of ngc  1569 , they can not be separated from the structures of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "we show every other channel map , starting at @xmath16  kms@xmath17 in figure  [ chanuni ] .",
    "the channel maps of the high - resolution cube clearly show galactic foreground emission in the velocity range from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "two features of galactic foreground emission seem to be localized in a broad stripe north of ngc  1569 , extending from the southeast to the northwest ( @xmath20 ) , and in a region at the southern rim of the channel maps ( @xmath21 ) , respectively . these could be easily removed from the data cube .",
    "the emission in the velocity range @xmath22 changes almost randomly from one map to the next with some structures persisting over several channels and is clearly foreground emission . at velocities",
    "@xmath23  kms@xmath17  @xmath24  kms@xmath17 , the line of sight toward ngc  1569 shows  emission , only part of which is likely to be extragalactic . as we can not determine the amount of the  emission belonging to the dwarf galaxy , we have to treat these channels with caution in our quantitative analysis .",
    "the higher sensitivity of the low - resolution cube reveals even more galactic foreground emission with the same general structure in the corresponding channel maps ( not shown here ) .",
    "luckily , much of the foreground emission is spatially separated from ngc  1569 in most channels .",
    "nevertheless , it complicates the analysis of the spectrum of the galaxy , because at some velocities ( @xmath25  kms@xmath17  and @xmath26  kms@xmath17 ) , the position of ngc  1569 is coincident with a negative side lobe of the large - scale foreground emission . as a means to largely remove the galactic structure while keeping the large - scale emission of ngc  1569 , we blanked the innermost pixels in the fourier plane of the affected channel maps . as a result",
    ", the negative trough has been nearly completely removed from the data cube .    in order to derive the overall  spectrum of ngc  1569 , we applied this blanking to the low - resolution cube , blanked the noise in the channels at the 3  rms level and removed the galactic foreground emission",
    "that is spatially separated from the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the slight asymmetry that we see in the resulting spectrum of the  emission in ngc  1569 ( fig .",
    "[ vlaspec ] ) may be due to galactic foreground emission that is in the line of sight toward ngc  1569 and/or may reflect a true asymmetry in the velocity field .    a standard issue in the analysis of interferometric data is possibly missing flux due to the reduced sensitivity of any interferometer to large - scale structure .",
    "we used effelsberg observations to also obtain a good single dish measurement of ngc1569 @xcite .",
    "the total hi flux derived from these data is consistent with that in the multi - configuration vla data .",
    "thus , a combination of the interferometric data with the single dish spectrum was not necessary . the total  mass of ngc  1569 resulting from the vla data is @xmath27 .",
    "for a comprehensive study of the small - scale structure of the main body of ngc  1569 , which we call the disk , we made channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ chanuni ] ) from the original high - resolution cube .",
    "we also produced a map of the   column density from the high - resolution data cube , which we corrected for the galactic foreground emission , excluding the channels dominated by galactic foreground emission and blanking the noise at the 3  rms level ( fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] ) .",
    "the maps of the velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ mom1 ] ) and of the velocity dispersion ( fig .",
    "[ mom2 ] ) have been calculated in the same manner .",
    "accounting for precession from the b1950 to the j2000 coordinate system , the position angle for the major axis determined from the column density map is in very good agreement with that determined by @xcite . in order to examine the data cube for kinematical peculiarities",
    ", we rotated the uncorrected high - resolution cube clockwise by 23 , so that the major axis of the  disk is aligned with the x - axis . from this data cube , we produced position - velocity maps of the central region , with a separation of about one beam width in declination ( fig .",
    "[ pv1 ] ) . interpreting the @xmath28 maps",
    ", one has to keep in mind that the upper part of the maps , especially at @xmath29  kms@xmath17 , may be affected by the galactic  foreground .",
    "the main features of the  distribution and of the  kinematics of the disk are summarized in table  2 .    the global velocity field of ngc  1569 ( fig .",
    "[ mom1 ] ) is consistent with slow solid - body rotation , with the eastern side of the gaseous disk receding at radial velocities of up to @xmath30 and the western side approaching at velocities @xmath31 .",
    "however , a closer look at the velocity field ( fig .  [ mom1 ] ) and the @xmath28 maps ( fig .  [ pv1 ] ) shows that in the central 900  pc of the disk , the velocity distribution is broader and seems to be independent of the position along the major axis .",
    "the decoupling of this region is in excellent agreement with the results of @xcite , who state that the center of the gaseous disk of ngc  1569  is strongly disrupted ",
    "( cf .  section  [ holes ] ) .    south of the disk",
    ", we find a roughly circularly shaped region of  emission , the `` southern blob '' ( fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] ) , which seems to be connected to the disk in the southeast by an  bridge , the `` junction '' .",
    "according to the position - velocity maps ( fig .",
    "[ pv1 ] ) , the southern blob consists of two velocity components . the main part of the blob has a velocity distribution in the range of while the protrusion , which may or may not be physically associated with the southern blob , shows velocities of @xmath32  kms@xmath17 .",
    "it is worth to note that the region in the disk opposite to this area shows a high radial velocity of @xmath33 , too .",
    "these features seem to be spatially associated with h@xmath0  filaments ( section  [ comparison ] )    the main body is elongated to the west , ending in an  arm which points westward . with the better sensitivity of the low - resolution cube , we can trace the  arm far out into the halo .",
    "thus , we treat it as a halo feature , which will be further discussed in sect .",
    "[ halo ] .",
    "using the high - resolution data cube , we searched for holes by analyzing the individual channel maps and the position - velocity diagrams . in order to minimize the unavoidable personal bias in the detection of holes ,",
    "each author has compiled a list of candidate holes .",
    "we used the standard criteria for holes as defined by @xcite : _ 1 ) _ the center of the hole must be stationary in the maps in which it is seen in order to avoid mixing up kinematical effects with holes ; _ 2 ) _ the hole must have a good contrast with respect to its surroundings in all relevant channel maps ; and _ 3 ) _ the shape of the hole must be clearly defined and adequately described by an ellipse .",
    "because neighboring pixels in our data are independent , we relaxed brinks and bajaja s fourth requirement that a hole should be visible in at least three successive channel maps . except for the prominent  chimney and one very tentative detection of a hole signature at @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where the high - resolution  column density map ( fig .  [ mom0 ] ) shows a local minimum , we have found no holes that satisfy the search criteria .",
    "several factors may impede the detection of  holes in ngc  1569 : first , the maximum expansion velocities of the shells surrounding the holes are naturally found along the steepest density gradient . in the case of ngc  1569 , the axis perpendicular to the disk is at an angle of @xmath36 from our line of sight , which may make the dominant velocity component difficult to detect . as the total column density of an individual pixel",
    "is the sum of the emission from a large volume along the line of sight , homogeneous regions along a line of sight could easily mask the depression in the  emission characterizing an  hole in the column density map .",
    "note however , that numerous holes have been detected in ic  2574 , a dwarf galaxy with an even higher inclination and a scale height of 350pc @xcite .",
    "second , the kinematical study by @xcite indicates that the center of the gaseous disk of ngc  1569 is quite disturbed . strong turbulence may mask the signature of holes in the position - velocity maps , but may also destroy these features .",
    "third , we note that some channel maps at high velocities are so contaminated by galactic foreground emission that it is impossible to determine the extragalactic  flux and morphology .",
    "any possible  shells with velocities @xmath37  kms@xmath17  can not be detected in our data .",
    "+ the complete lack of detectable holes , with the notable exception of the  chimney at the position of the two sscs , may reflect an actual absence of large holes in ( the center of ) the disk of ngc  1569 .",
    "the destruction of a possible past hole - dominated  structure ( `` swiss cheese '' ) may have been caused by gas accretion ( section [ halo ] ) and the extraordinary strength of the starburst itself . we have noted earlier ( section  [ disk ] ) that the characteristic solid body rotation seems to commence at a radius of about 450  pc , while the gas kinematics in the center of the disk is consistent with no systematic rotation . this velocity structure may indicate that the low - angular momentum gas in the center has been blown to larger radii . taking into account the observed biconical outflow along the minor axis of the galaxy",
    ", the remnant of the swept - up gas may be located in a ring in the disk ( `` donut '' ) .",
    "such a scenario is in good agreement with the high - resolution  column density and velocity maps . due to the high inclination of the disk , the  emission from the nearer and the farther side of the ring most likely overlap , resulting in a broad high - column density ridge .",
    "the  chimney is then located in the southern part of the ring , while the more homogeneous   distribution in the northern part gives rise to the higher column density found in the projection north of the chimney ( fig .",
    "[ mom0 ] ) . adopting the 3-d model of @xcite and assuming that the ring lies in the plane of the major axis of the galaxy ,",
    "the northern part of the ring is closer to the observer than the southern one .",
    "the difference in the average velocity ( @xmath38  kms@xmath17 , fig .",
    "[ mom1 ] ) between the nearer ( northern ) and the farther ( southern ) side of the ring might trace the remnant expansion of the hot central bubble , before it bursted out of the disk .    with a supernova rate of @xmath39  snemyr@xmath17 over the last @xmath40  myr @xcite",
    ", the starburst has been intense enough to sweep the whole central region from neutral atomic hydrogen , heat the dust and the molecular gas to unusually high temperatures @xcite , and to form a strong galactic wind @xcite .",
    "other evidence for a depletion of neutral gas in the center of the galaxy may be the paucity of radio supernovae and supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that the younger star clusters have a significantly lower mass compared to the older ones and suggest that the strong radiation field and the burst of supernova explosions prevented the assembly of large molecular clouds in the observed central region of ngc  1569 .",
    "+ the formation of a donut  structure as a consequence of violent star formation may indeed occur frequently in dwarf galaxies .",
    "ngc  4449 , another star - forming dwarf galaxy , is conspicuous because of the lack of   holes in its inner disk ( hunter , van woerden & gallagher 1999 ) . instead",
    ", the  distribution is dominated by a huge ring .",
    "the dwarf galaxy holmberg i shows a ring - like  morphology , too , with a pronounced depletion of the  column density in the center of the galaxy and evidence for a blow - out @xcite . in a recent sample of late - type dwarf galaxies , one third of the galaxies",
    "are characterized by a high - column density feature with @xmath41  cm@xmath17 in the form of a ring and low  column densities in the center @xcite .",
    "the rings , which appear to be broken in some cases , usually have a size comparable to the underlying  disk . with ngc  1569 , we may have found a prototype of this interesting class of galaxies viewed at a large inclination .",
    "@xcite found three shells and numerous filaments in the h@xmath0   distribution ( fig .",
    "two adjacent shells are located at the eastern rim of the   ridge south of the center of the eastern ridge .",
    "the third one is located south of the  chimney and the h@xmath0  trough . in order to confirm possible associations between the h@xmath0  morphology and the  distribution , it is necessary to obtain velocity information for the different h@xmath0  features .",
    "tomita , ohta , & saito ( 1994 ) performed long - slit h@xmath0  spectroscopy covering the optical extent of ngc  1569 with 11 slits of 50 in length and 18 wide .",

    ", @xcite found the kinematical signature of a shell ( ss  1 ) , whose velocities are consistent with the corresponding  velocity distribution .",
    "the pronounced chimney in the  ridge coincides with the position of the super - star clusters and with a minimum in the h@xmath0  emission ( fig .",
    "[ ha ] , left ) .",
    "this may indicate that the sscs have blown away the ism in their surroundings .",
    "shock waves from ( multiple ) supernova explosions may have ionized the bubble and triggered new star formation in the swept - up shell , resulting in today s   regions around the sscs .",
    "neutral atomic hydrogen can still exist outside of this area .    the only clear spatial correspondence between the h@xmath0  filaments and the   structure occurs for filaments # 7 and # 8 ( in * ? ? ?",
    "[ ha ] , right ) , which delineate the northern and the southeastern rim of the southern blob .",
    "these features , combined with the main disk and the prominent h@xmath0  arm ( filament # 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be the remnant of a huge h@xmath0  shell .",
    "the kinematical information of @xcite allow for an association between the tip of the h@xmath0  arm and the high - velocity  gas south of the disk .    at the position of the h@xmath0  shell ss  5 in slits j and k ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , a local minimum in the  emission",
    "can be found in the corresponding @xmath28 maps , most noticeably in the  slit j , which reaches velocities of up to @xmath45  kms@xmath17 .",

    "the lower h@xmath0  velocity component of about @xmath47  kms@xmath17   has no counterpart in the  gas .",
    "we did not identify  features corresponding to the other h@xmath0 shells @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the gaussian fit has compressed a broad distribution of h@xmath0  velocities to one or two values .",
    "another possible explanation is that the distribution of the neutral gas may be more strongly affected by the turbulence in the inner disk than the h@xmath0   morphology , resulting in a higher velocity dispersion smearing out the kinematical signatures of a shell .",
    "utilizing the high sensitivity of the low - resolution  cube , we investigated the gaseous halo of ngc  1569 .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of extragalactic low - intensity  emission close to ngc  1569 , which they named ngc  1569-hi and which they suggested to consider as a companion to the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the existence and the velocity structure of this feature and of the so - called  bridge , which seems to connect ngc  1569-hi and the disk , are readily confirmed in our  column density map and velocity field derived from the naturally weighted and foreground - corrected vla data cube ( fig .",
    "[ stream.mom0 ] and [ stream.mom1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have found very faint filamentary  emission , the ``  stream '' , south of the disk of ngc  1569 , which appears to stretch from the western end of the  bridge east of the galaxy , to the western  arm .",
    "there is also faint emission northeast of ngc  1569-hi , which we call the `` northern blob '' .",

    "[ streamoverlay ] ) and their  masses are summarized in table  3 .",
    "the corresponding spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ halospec ] .",
    "in contrast to the other features , the northern blob seems to be a superposition of many small  clouds with slightly different velocities , and is possibly of galactic origin .",
    "it is remarkable that the  arm can be seen in the halo as well as in the disk , reaching inward all the way into the main body of ngc  1569 .",
    "the position of the inner  arm suggests that it might be an extension of the apparent  high column density ridge .",
    "but the velocity field ( fig .  [ mom1 ] ) and the @xmath28 maps ( fig .  [ pv1 ] ) imply that this structure forms a different kinematical component : the western end recedes at @xmath48 , while the eastern side approaches the observer at a speed of about @xmath49  kms@xmath17 relative to the systemic velocity of @xmath50  kms@xmath17 .",
    "the red - shifted velocity component at @xmath51 visible in the southwestern @xmath28 maps might be the root of the  arm .",
    "the entire arm including the region where it connects to the inner disk is well west of the optical disk and the h@xmath0  and x - ray halos @xcite . probably related to the interface between disk and arm , the radial velocity dispersion in the southern part of the western ridge is twice as high as the average velocity dispersion of @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ mom2 ] ) .",
    "this `` hot spot '' ( table 2 ) may indicate a region of velocity crowding , i.e.  the superposition of several kinematical components .",
    "note that the root of the h@xmath0  arm coincides with the hot spot , while the tip of the arm seems to be spatially and kinematically associated with the high - velocity region in the southern  disk ( cf .",
    "thus , we may see here a superposition of the kinematical signature of the disk , the peculiar velocity of an extension of the  arm , and possibly a contribution of  gas associated with the h@xmath0  arm .",
    "although parts of the  stream have a velocity range that is very close to that typical for the galactic clouds in this region , there are several indications that the detected  clouds are not a condensation in the galactic foreground , but rather belong to the halo of ngc  1569 .",
    "a first hint at their extragalactic nature is the conspicuous structure , which seems to stretch from the western end of the  bridge to the  arm in the west ( fig .",
    "[ stream.mom0 ] ) .",

    "[ stream.mom1 ] ) . as part of an extended halo structure ,",
    "the puzzling kinematical behavior of the  arm would find a compelling explanation .",
    "the halo feature may be  gas that has been pulled out of the disk by tidal forces due to an interaction with a nearby galaxy or a condensation in the igm that had come close to ngc  1569 and has then been tidally disrupted in its gravitational potential .",
    "thus , the coherent morphology and velocity field of the structure suggest that the  arm , the  stream , the bridge and the companion are physically associated , and we consider it unlikely that the detected clouds are part of the galactic foreground .",

    ", an  cloud may have come close to the gravitational potential of ngc  1569 and been tidally disrupted while falling toward the disk of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "there are no traces of any internal rotation in the halo structure , which implies that the infalling cloud would have been nearly face - on or that tidal forces would have completely disrupted the velocity field of the cloud .",
    "a number of observations support the scenario of an infalling  cloud as the origin of the halo structure . to begin with",
    ", the existence of an  companion close to a star forming dwarf galaxy is not unusual . in a high - resolution  survey of a volume - limited sample of 21 blue compact dwarf galaxies one or more companions",
    "have been detected near 12 galaxies @xcite .",
    "four of the companions have no optical counterparts and may thus be  clouds . in a similar study , @xcite found   clouds with masses of @xmath63 around four out of five barred magellanic - type spiral galaxies of their sample .",
    "most of the clouds seem to be interacting with their primary galaxy .",
    "recently  clouds have been detected in the halo of m  31 , too , which are likely similar to the high - velocity clouds of the milky way and which may be debris from recent mergers or interactions @xcite .",
    "an example for a tidally disrupted   cloud in the process of being accreted onto the disk of a spiral galaxy has been presented by @xcite : an extended stream of small  clouds seems to wrap around the grand - design spiral galaxy ngc  4254 in a spiral pattern that indicates that this gas will probably merge with the primary galaxy in the near future and that other gas may have already been accreted . the  mass of these clouds is @xmath64 .",
    "the halo structure of ngc  1569 is very similar to the disrupted  cloud around ngc  4254 appearing like a scaled - down , tilted version of the latter s  stream .",
    "this suggests accretion processes that are in a similar phase .",
    "@xcite found that the process of galaxy formation by the accretion of gas from a primordial reservoir may still go on in the dwarf galaxy ic  10 .",
    "however , there is no indication for such a huge gas halo around ngc  1569 .",
    "thus , any infalling  gas is probably an intergalactic cloud that survived in this sparsely populated region of the universe until the encounter with ngc  1569 .",
    "more evidence in favor of the scenario of an infalling cloud can be found in ngc  1569 itself .",
    "it is conspicuous that the x - ray emission , the h@xmath0  filaments and the radio continuum distribution all extend over about the same region , well inside the area enveloped by the  halo , and in particular with a sharp boundary east of the  arm . here , at the location of the prominent h@xmath0  arm",
    ", @xcite found evidence for shocked , x - ray emitting gas , while our kinematical study of the  emission reveals the superposition of two or three velocity components at the hot spot close to the arm .",
    "thus , it is tempting to assume that this region is not only the remnant of a huge shell ( sect .",
    "[ comparison ] ) , but also the impact zone of the gas falling onto the disk of ngc  1569 .",
    "the emergence of the starburst and its extraordinarily high star formation rate could then be explained by the accretion of  gas with a mass of about @xmath65 , which replenished the gas reservoir of ngc  1569 . in this picture , the halo structure observed today would be only the remnant of an intergalactic cloud of originally a few times @xmath65 .",
    "note that this mass estimate is in very good agreement with the masses of the other mentioned streams , but also only about an order of magnitude lower than the estimated total mass of ngc  1569 .",
    "we observed the detailed  emission of the post - starburst dwarf galaxy ngc  1569 with the vla ( b- , c- , and d - configuration ) .",
    "the galactic foreground  emission was minimized by spatial frequency filtering and subsequent careful blanking of still affected regions .",
    "a comparison of the vla data with a single - dish spectrum indicates little or no missing flux in the interferometric data cube .",
    "our main results are :      in the central region of the disk ( @xmath68  pc ) , the kinematics appears to be highly disturbed , whereas the outer regions show a slow solid body rotation .",
    "we suggest that the gas in the center of the galaxy , which is characterized by low angular momentum , may have been blown to larger radii by the strong stellar winds and multiple supernova explosions that also drive the galactic outflow , ultimately resulting in a high - density  ring ( donut ) and a depletion of  gas in the center of ngc  1569 .",
    "a pronounced chimney in the  distribution , which probably lies in the southern , remote part of the ring , is coincident with the position of the two prominent super - star clusters and with a double - peaked h@xmath0  line profile .",
    "our interpretation is that strong stellar winds from massive stars and supernova explosions in these clusters may have blown away the surrounding ism and may have led to secondary star formation in the swept - up material , now seen as a ring of  regions .",
    "the prominent western h@xmath0  arm may be associated with some of the  emission south of the disk .",
    "together with two southern h@xmath0  filaments and the southern  blob , this structure might be the remnant of a huge shell .",
    "we confirm the existence and the velocity structure of  gas in the halo of ngc  1569 , apparently consisting of the companion `` ngc  1569-hi '' and an  bridge . in our high - sensitivity data , we found additional faint   emission in the southern halo of ngc  1569 .",
    "the  arm of ngc  1569 , an apparent extension of the disk to the west , has a kinematical behavior that differs strongly from the velocity field in the disk , but seems to be continued in the newly detected halo gas .",
    "its peculiar velocity can be traced far into the western part of the disk .",
    "the hot spot , a region of  velocity crowding in the western disk of ngc  1569 can thus be interpreted as the superposition of the kinematical components of the  disk , the  arm , and possibly an  counterpart of the h@xmath0  arm .    as a new comprehensive picture of the halo around ngc  1569 , we propose that the known halo features , the newly detected  gas in the southern halo and the western  arm form a coherent halo structure , which can be traced from a location in the center of the disk via the  arm , the stream and the bridge to ngc  1569-hi . thus , a continuous halo feature seems to wrap around the disk of ngc  1569 from the companion east of the galaxy to the western  arm and maybe even further .",
    "the most likely causes for the detected  halo gas are tidal interaction with a nearby galaxy or accretion of neutral atomic hydrogen .",
    "we suggest that the halo gas may be the remnant of an intergalactic  cloud that has been tidally disrupted when approaching the dwarf galaxy and may already have been partially accreted onto the disk of the galaxy .",
    "such an event would have likely triggered a starburst .",
    "the unusually high star formation rate in ngc  1569 could thus be explained by the replenishment of the  reservoir in its disk by the newly accreted material .",
    "we are grateful to c.  brns for performing the observations at effelsberg and to d.  hunter for sending us her digital h@xmath0  image .",
    "we thank ernie seaquist , dave westphal and bill waller for helpful comments .",
