    "since their inception into the theoretical framework of physics , much work has been carried out on both the fermi - dirac as well as the bose - einstein distributions @xcite .",
    "much of this focuses on the behaviour of fermions and bosons at low temperatures , where the deviations in their behaviour arising from the distributions are significant and quantum effects dominate .",
    "the advent of comprehensive experimental techniques for lowering the temperature of systems to previously theoretical values over the last few decades has contributed significantly to this and revealed a wealth of unusual behaviour at extremely low temperatures , in particular the unusual phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation - a macroscopic occupation of the ground state of a gas of bosons at finite temperature .    for most of this time , however , there has been only a cursory and passing interest in _ low - dimensional _ fermi and bose systems .",
    "this has been mainly because they have been viewed as little more than abstract theoretical and mathematical constructs .",
    "moreover , it was felt that there was little behaviour of interest to be found in these lower dimensions .",
    "it is only over the last couple of decades that there has been a growing interest in the properties of gases obeying the fermi and bose distributions in lower dimensions .",
    "this has been driven by firstly , the growing practical importance of low - dimensional systems , such as for example in computers , as well as new experimental techniques ( such as , for example , 2d adsorbed systems , in particular , 2d adsorbed helium films @xcite ) that raise the possibility of being able to trap and study low - dimensional quantum systems . typical systems being studied include superfluid and superconducting films , quantum hall and related two - dimensional electron gases and low - dimensional trapped bose gases .",
    "further , the renewed theoretical interest in low - dimensional physics over the last couple of decades has led to a growing realisation that these systems possess equally fascinating and unique quantum behaviour of their own ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "in particular , recent observations of exotic quantum behavior , such as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite and fermi degeneracy @xcite , in three - dimensional systems have led to a growing interest in lower - dimensional systems .",
    "one special theoretical interest in the 2d ideal gas is due to the fact that we can obtain completely analytic expressions for the chemical potential @xmath0 and other thermodynamic properties .",
    "this arises , in part , from the energy - independence of the 2d density of states within the semi - classical approximation .",
    "furthermore , in two dimensions , there is an unusual correspondence between the bose and fermi cases , first noted by may @xcite and subsequently , explored further in later papers @xcite .    in his seminal paper @xcite , may noted the unexpected result that the thermal capacities of the ideal 2d bose and fermi gases are identical in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. their internal energies differ only by a constant temperature - independent amount .",
    "this only holds in the thermodynamic limit , or equivalently , the semi - classical approximation that the energy level spacing is negligible compared with the temperature _ t _ , allowing us to replace the discrete ( quantum ) structure by a continuum .",
    "real - world systems , however , are always finite , typically of the order of @xmath1 particles for trapped gases , and more for adsorbed systems . moreover , as we shall see later , the chemical potential @xmath0 has a logarithmic dependence on the total number of particles @xmath2 in the system .",
    "thus , _ the thermodynamic limit is never truly reached in two dimensions _ and is an abstract theoretical construct , making it essential to consider finite - size effects .",
    "these may be experimentally significant , and lead to deviations from may s theorem .    in the following sections",
    ", we shall consider the behaviour of the uniform 2d ideal bose and fermi gases . in the next section",
    ", we shall briefly outline the gases in the thermodynamic limit and derive may s theorem before examining the bose and fermi gases for a finite number of particles in section [ the finite gas ] . though there is no bec in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we will demonstrate that there is a pseudo - condensation at very low temperatures for the finite 2d bose gas .",
    "this is then used to show in section [ heat capacities ] that the finite - size effects lead to differing heat capacities for the bose and fermi gases , and a breakdown in may s theorem for gases with a finite number of particles .",
    "further , the inadequacy of heat capacities as a means of determining phase transitions is discussed .",
    "as the 2d ideal gas and may s theorem have already been examined at length before in the thermodynamic limit@xcite , we shall simply draw on earlier approaches to provide a brief overview .",
    "consider @xmath2 free and identical particles of mass @xmath3 in a 2d _ box _ of volume@xmath4 , with rigid - box boundary conditions .",
    "the energy values for an arbitrary particle then are @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum characterising the energy states @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are points in the positive quadrant of a unit square lattice . in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state energy tends to 0 . for a finite system , however , due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle , this is always greater than 0 , as @xmath10 .",
    "so , for simplicity , we shift the energy scale , taking the ground state energy as 0 , @xmath11 assuming that the system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath12 and chemical potential @xmath0 , then the mean number of particles @xmath13 at a given energy @xmath7 is given by @xmath14 here and later , the upper ( lower ) signs are for fermions ( bosons ) . the total number of particles _",
    "n _ and the internal energy _",
    "e _ of the system are now given by @xmath15 where the sum is taken over the single particle energy states .",
    "in the semiclassical approximation , we assume that the spacing between the energy levels of the particle states is negligible .",
    "this allows us to replace the sum with an integral over energy states using the density of states @xmath16 and the spin degeneracy @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a general single - particle function of energy .",
    "however , this approximation is only exact in the thermodynamic limit when the system size is infinite , and at very high temperatures @xmath12 . as we shall see in section [ the finite gas ] , for finite systems at low _",
    "t _ , these assumptions are invalid and the discreteness of the energy levels can not be ignored . in other words",
    ", we will be at a temperature @xmath12 below which the semiclassical approximation breaks down and modifications need to be made .",
    "however , it may be possible to compensate by modifying the semi - classical approximation to allow for finite - size effects .",
    "we now evaluate the various thermodynamic quantities for arbitrary spin , i.e. arbitrary @xmath17 , for both the 2d fermi and bose gases in the thermodynamic limit . in 2d , @xmath16 and thereby , the fermi energy @xmath20 are given by , @xmath21 for comparison , we adopt @xmath20 as a characteristic energy @xmath22 for the bose gas also , allowing us to express later results in a unified form . in 2d , as @xmath16 is a constant , we have a simple integral for _ n _ , @xmath23 this may be expressed using the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein functions @xcite , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the euler gamma function .",
    "these can also be expressed using the polylogarithmic functions @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 for _ n _ above , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the fugacity ( @xmath32 ) . solving ( [ eq : ten ] ) in terms of @xmath22 and rearranging , we can now express the fugacity @xmath31 and thereby , the chemical potential @xmath0 as a completely analytic expression @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the fugacity for the ideal fermi ( bose ) gas . as @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 smoothly approaches 1 . denoting the fugacity @xmath35 by @xmath38 , as @xmath39 , @xmath40 _",
    "n _ diverges logarithmically as @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it has no upper bound , and there is no temperature below which the ground state can be said to be macroscopically occupied in comparison to the excited states .",
    "thus , there is no bec in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a qualification of the oft - paraded statement that there is no bec for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of dimensions .",
    "however , as we shall see in section [ the finite gas ] , the logarithmic divergence implies that at sufficiently low _",
    "t _ , bosons still crowd into low - lying states to give a pseudo - condensate .",
    "the internal energy may be similarly solved , @xmath44 now , using the following property of the dilogarithmic function@xcite @xmath45 , @xmath46 we can easily show @xmath47 i.e. for all @xmath12 , @xmath48 differs from @xmath49 by a constant temperature independent energy , which does not contribute to the heat capacity .",
    "this gives may s theorem @xcite , which states that the heat capacities of the ideal 2d fermi and bose gases are identical at all _",
    "n _ , @xmath50 the above result indicates that the 2d ideal bose gas does not undergo a phase transition , as any experimental measurement of the heat capacity would be the same as for a 2d fermi gas , and would lack the characteristic bump that indicates the presence of bec in the 3d bose gas . however , as we shall see",
    ", this is because we have failed to consider the finite nature of any real systems .",
    "the case of the finite ideal bose gas in two dimensions has already been considered to varying degrees in earlier papers @xcite , and more recently , by pathria @xcite . most have commented that it may be possible to have a pseudo - condensation in the bose gas in two dimensions , with the transition temperature typically going as @xmath51 .",
    "here , we present a simpler and more comprehensive analysis of the problem that not only offers far more insight into how the finite size of the system leads to the breakdown of may s theorem and a pseudo - condensation in the bose gas , but further , in section [ heat capacities ] , discusses how the heat capacities for the fermi and bose gases differ for finite systems , and how such a pseudo - condensation may be experimentally measured .    at @xmath52 ,",
    "the 2d bose gas is in its ground state , and we have the trivial case of ground state macroscopic occupation . extrapolating , however , a range of finite temperatures must exist near @xmath52 , which may depend on @xmath2 , where the number of particles in the ground state is also of @xmath53 - a macroscopic occupation . at very low @xmath12 , this can be a significant fraction of @xmath2 , and the semi - classical approach is now flawed as @xmath2 is no longer continuous .",
    "taking macroscopic occupation of the ground state as the defining characteristic of bec , we consider the ground state separately analogous to standard treatments of the 3d bose gas @xcite . for finite systems ,",
    "the discrete level structure requires us to introduce a cutoff energy at the first excited level @xmath54 .",
    "the integral is now bounded and we can remove the logarithmic divergence .",
    "thus , we can have a pseudo - bec in a finite two - dimensional system .",
    "this must be associated with a breakdown of may s theorem at sufficiently low @xmath12 for finite systems .",
    "we thus write ( [ eq : ten ] ) for the bose gas as @xmath55    it should be noted that the above approximation is quite a simple and crude one , as it is only the leading term of the euler - maclaurin summation formula .",
    "however , it suits the purposes of our paper as our intention here is merely to highlight how even the simplest approximations show that there is a pseudo - condensation in the finite bose gas .",
    "a more detailed approximation will only lead to minor modifications to the core results presented in the rest of this paper .",
    "further , the leading correction term to the integral above in the euler - maclaurin expansion is of the order of @xmath56 . taking the ratio @xmath57 of the number of particles in the ground state to that in the first excited state",
    ", we can see @xmath58 as the chemical potential @xmath0 for the 2d bose gas is always negative and less than @xmath59 , the above ration is always greater than 1 .",
    "further , as @xmath36 , @xmath60 and the above expression clearly goes to @xmath61 .",
    "further , a more detailed evaluation of ( [ eq : a ] ) gives us @xmath62 this clearly rapidly goes to infinity as both the temperature @xmath12 as well as the number of particles @xmath2 increase .",
    "moreover , for the regime in question , we are interested in very low temperatures where from the above equation ( [ eq : b ] ) , the ratio @xmath57 is clearly significantly large .",
    "thus , we are justified in making our crude approximation and denoting the number of particles @xmath2 by ( [ eq : twentyfive ] ) above . solving as before , we now have @xmath63 and @xmath54 prevents the logarithmic divergence .",
    "this is because the excited states can not accommodate all the particles at low @xmath12 , and the excess are forced into the ground state , leading to a pseudo - bec .",
    "equivalently , changing variables @xmath64 and resetting the integral from zero , we may also express ( [ eq : twentyfive ] ) in terms of the bose - einstein functions @xmath65 as @xmath66 thus , we now have an effective fugacity @xmath67 where @xmath35 is as before .",
    "this summarizes the finite - size effects on the bose gas .",
    "the extra term is dependent on the system size and tends to 1 as @xmath68 . for finite @xmath2 and low @xmath12 , it is less than 1 , and so , the fugacity is modified .",
    "thus , there is a pseudo - bec here but none in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this macroscopic occupation is a purely boson phenomenon , and so , the behaviour will be markedly different from that of the two - dimensional fermi gas .    for the fermi gas ,",
    "pauli s principle forbids macroscopic occupation of any state .",
    "thus , the first term is not divergent .",
    "@xmath34 ( eq . ( [ eq : seventeen ] ) ) still holds , and finite - size effects only appear for the bose gas , where the excited states take as many particles as possible at low @xmath12 , with the excess forced into the ground state .",
    "this occurs at the maximal value of the fugacity @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we can define a characteristic temperature @xmath70 that marks the onset of condensation where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 for very low @xmath12 .",
    "we may solve ( [ eq : twentynine ] ) to give @xmath74 where , @xmath75 is the lambert function @xcite and is the principal solution for @xmath76 in the equation @xmath77 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . it may be viewed as a generalisation to a logarithm .",
    "thus , our result ( [ eq : thirty ] ) is a refinement of the earlier noted result that the transition temperature behaves like @xmath51 . as @xmath68 , the reduced characteristic temperature @xmath78 .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit , we recover the conventional result that there is no bec in two dimensions .",
    "the condensate fraction is @xmath79% \\label{eq : thirtyone}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this only holds for very low temperatures @xmath80 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the condensate occurs at lower and lower @xmath12 as the system size @xmath2 increases . in the thermodynamic limit , there is no bec at all .",
    "having shown the pseudo - condensation , we now move on to consider how the fermi - bose correspondence predicted by may is affected when the gases are assumed finite .",
    "the internal energies may be similarly found . the first term in ( [ eq : six ] ) for the bose gas is divergent as it is the internal energy @xmath81 associated with the anomalously large ground state .",
    "separating this out , @xmath82 as we have set @xmath81 as the zero - point energy , the first term is 0 . changing variables @xmath83 , and converting to an integral , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined by ( [ eq : twentyeight ] ) .",
    "we again have an effective fugacity @xmath86 and additional terms , which are negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "by contrast , for the finite fermi gas , there is no divergence in the ground state term , and we have the same expression for the fugacity ( [ eq : seventeen ] ) as before .",
    "the internal energies of the finite two - dimensional fermi and bose gases are then given by @xmath87 eq .",
    "( [ eq : twentythree ] ) is no longer true , as we can not simply express @xmath49 in terms of @xmath88 as before .",
    "@xmath48 now has additional @xmath12-dependent terms that lead to a differing heat capacity .",
    "may s theorem is thus a special limiting case for the 2d bose and fermi internal energies in the thermodynamic limit . here , the additional factor @xmath89 tends to unity in the thermodynamic limit , recovering may s theorem .",
    "the same occurs in the high @xmath12 limit for a finite gas as above @xmath70 , there is no macroscopic ground state occupation .",
    "thus , above @xmath70 , we may approximate the internal energies by ( [ eq : twenty ] ) and ( [ eq : twentyone ] ) with differences becoming marked only at very low @xmath12 and/or very small system size @xmath2 .",
    "we now calculate the bose and fermi heat capacities by using the following polylogarithmic identity @xcite , @xmath90 the heat capacity for the finite gas is then given by    @xmath91% \\label{eq : thirtyseven } \\\\",
    "c_{v , bose}= \\frac{nk_{b}^2}{\\varepsilon_c}\\left[2tg_{2}\\left(z_{b}'\\right)+\\frac{\\varepsilon_{c}}{k_{b } } \\frac{\\ln\\left(1-z_{b}'\\right)}{e^{{\\varepsilon_c}/{k_{b}t}}-1}\\right]% \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{3\\pi\\alpha k_{b}}{16 n } \\left[\\frac{\\varepsilon_c \\left(3\\pi\\alpha z_{b}'-4ne^{-{\\varepsilon_c}/{k_{b}t } - { 3\\alpha\\pi\\varepsilon_c } /{4nk_{b}t}}\\right)}{k_{b}t\\left(1-z_{b}'\\right)}-8n\\ln\\left(1-z_{b}'\\right)\\right]% \\label{eq : thirtyeight}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the bose heat capacity @xmath92 now contains several terms dependent on both @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
    "it should also be noted that the last two terms in the heat capacity are very much smaller than the first two terms and become increasingly negligible as the system size increases . at high @xmath12 and/or very large @xmath2",
    ", the additional terms tend to zero , i.e. as @xmath68 and/or @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and ( [ eq : thirtyeight ] ) reduces to the standard expression in the thermodynamic limit ,    @xmath95    this is one of the most important results of our paper , and shows clearly that may s theorem arises as the thermodynamic limit of ( [ eq : thirtyseven ] ) and ( [ eq : thirtyeight ] ) , when the heat capacities of the bose and fermi gases become equal .",
    "nevertheless , for most real - world 2d systems , above the characteristic temperature @xmath70 , which marks the onset of bose - einstein condensation in the two - dimensional ideal bose gas , @xmath96 is very small and so , even for finite gases , the thermal capacities of the bose and fermi systems are approximately equal above the condensation temperature .    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the reduced heat capacities ( @xmath97 ) for the fermi and bose gases against the reduced temperature @xmath98(where @xmath99 ) for varying system size @xmath2 , using the full expression for both @xmath92 and @xmath100 .",
    "as the heat capacity is approximately linear close to @xmath52 in the thermodynamic limit , we would expect the plots for the 2d fermi gas to tend to a horizontal line as @xmath36 .",
    "this limiting value will be at the critical value when @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 in contrast , for the finite 2d bose gas , we expect to see a deviation from the above mentioned low - temperature behaviour .",
    "in particular , we expect that the reduced heat capacity ( @xmath97 ) will fall to 0 following the formation of the condensate .",
    "our plots indicate distinct differences between the reduced heat capacities for the bose and fermi gases , particularly at very low @xmath12 in the vicinity of and below the condensation temperature @xmath70 .",
    "then , @xmath92 is less than @xmath100 and starts to deviate significantly around @xmath70 , before rapidly going to zero as we approach @xmath52 .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the 3d bose gas , where the conventional heat capacity @xmath103 peaks at some finite @xmath12 . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "however , the heat capacity @xmath103 is a smooth function of @xmath12 , in keeping with the size - dependent nature of the condensation . here , instead",
    ", we see a bumpin the plot for the reduced heat capacity @xmath97 of the 2d bose gas , indicating the presence of a condensation .",
    "further , as _ n _ increases , the behaviour tends to that of the 2d fermi gas as the condensation forms at lower temperatures , and consequently , the fall - off of the reduced heat capacity occurs at lower temperatures .",
    "indeed , with @xmath104 , the two plots of the fermi and bose gases are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "this is significant as conventionally , the heat capacity @xmath103 is used experimentally to determine if a bose - einstein condensation has occurred .",
    "however , as can be seen from above , the heat capacity does not necessarily peak for a weak transition which is dependent on the system size , and we have to examine alternate expressions to determine the presence of a condensation .",
    "in this paper , we set out to discuss the two - dimensional ideal bose and fermi gases in the absence of any trapping potentials , and both in the thermodynamic limit and the finite case .",
    "in particular , we were interested in may s theorem , and its breakdown for finite systems .    as can be seen above in sections [ the finite gas ] and [ heat capacities ]",
    ", the 2d finite fermi system displays the same behaviour as in the thermodynamic limit but the bose gas deviates significantly for a finite system and undergoes a pseudo - bose - einstein condensation .",
    "it is not a truecondensation as for the 3d bose gas , where there is a distinct phase transition in the thermodynamic limit and a peak in the heat capacity .",
    "rather , here we have a characteristic condensation temperature @xmath70 that is dependent on the system size and tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , though these is no heat capacity peak here , it still deviates significantly from the fermi heat capacity below @xmath70 with the deviations tending to zero as the system size and/or the temperature increase . in other words",
    ", we have a peak in the reduced heat capacity , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . this raises the question of what exactly is defined as a phase transition .",
    "the two - dimensional bose gas undergoes a significant change at low temperatures but only in the finite case .",
    "thus , it is not what may be termed a conventionalphase transition as for the three - dimensional bose gas , since it ceases to exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , from an experimental perspective , a system is never truly in the thermodynamic limit , and so , what we have termed a pseudo - condensationis expected .",
    "this also , therefore , casts doubt on the use of the heat capacity as a means of identifying phase transitions , as discussed above .    as a final note",
    ", we would like to consider some of the outstanding problems .",
    "the above analysis is a simple one and deals with only the _ ideal _ two - dimensional gas .",
    "there is still considerable debate whether such behaviour is to be found for an _ interacting _ two - dimensional gas .",
    "some authors@xcite have claimed that there is a true condensation for the finite interacting 2d system at sufficiently low temperatures as the coherence length becomes larger than the condensate size .",
    "others , however , have claimed that any phase transition would disappear in the presence of particle interactions@xcite , as predicted by the hohenberg theorem .",
    "clearly , the presence of interactions will modify our results greatly .",
    "as yet , however , there is no indication if there is any correspondence between the two - dimensional fermi and bose gases , when they are interacting , and further , if a pseudo - condensation is to be found for the finite bose gas .",
    "further , similar analogues exist in other dimensions for ideal gases in a trapping potential@xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to debate whether there are deeper implications due to the fermi - bose correspondence , and where such an situation occurs , it is a special unique case .",
    "this is an area of active work , with new experimental innovations making the resolution of the above problems and the elucidation of two - dimensional gases only a matter of time now ."
