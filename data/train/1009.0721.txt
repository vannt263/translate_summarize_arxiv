    ", observations have revealed that these are highly structured .",
    "@xcite reported that in active regions , at locations of high magnetic flux density correspond in both ca and g - band images a large variety of features that they describe as filamentary crinkles - like structures , roundish flower- and ribbon - like features and , at the smallest spatial scales , point - like brightenings .",
    "photometric properties and magnetic flux density are not constant within most of them , both contrast and magnetic flux density being in general higher at their edges and lower at their centers . the opposite is observed for point - like features .",
    "all these structures are highly dynamic and can evolve one into another @xcite . in quiet sun regions ,",
    "most of the features are point - like and are often clustered in groups or `` patches '' at the edges of granules and mesogranules @xcite . the properties of g - band bright features ( e.g. ,",
    "dimension and contrast ) strongly depend on the angular resolution of observations so that it is hard to rigorously define the `` real bright point '' .",
    "for this reason , in the following we will use the name `` bright feature '' to indicate a local excess of brightening in the intergranular lanes of g - band filtergrams , independently of the properties of the feature itself .",
    "theoretically , bright features were investigated through the model of flux - tube @xcite , a small - size concentration of magnetic field surrounded by field - free plasma . due to the high magnetic pressure inside the kg flux tube , the gas pressure ( gas density )",
    "is strongly reduced causing the photons to escape from deep photospheric layers that are hotter than the surrounding plasma in cold intergranular lanes .",
    "numerical static and dynamic models of isolated @xcite or clustered @xcite flux tubes , have proved to be successful in reproducing many of the observed properties , such as the enhancement of contrast toward the limb and in some molecular bands ( in particular ch and cn bands , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of dark lanes which often accompany the bright features in off - disk center observations , and the suppression of convective motions within them .    from the above figure follows that g - band bright features are proxies for kg fields in the solar photosphere .",
    "on the other hand , the inspection of movies reveals that the brightness of the features is not constant with time but intermittently can vary such that features can appear dark or bright at different instant .",
    "this evidence questions the flux tube evacuation as the principal physical mechanism responsible for contrast enhancement in small size magnetic concentrations .",
    "the understanding of the relation between the contrast measured in molecular bands and the properties of magnetic concentrations is of relevance for all those studies which employ broad - band imaging as proxy of strong magnetic fields @xcite . in particular g - band imaging of the solar photosphere , thanks to the high spatial resolution that can be achieved in these data , is an independent and complementary tool to spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "this is of great relevance , for instance , for the investigation of the presence of kg fields in the quiet sun , which is still a debated topic in solar physics ( see * ? ? ?",

    "in @xcite the first results from observations performed with ibis @xcite in spectropolarimetric mode revealed the advantages of combining high spatial resolution spectropolarimetry simultaneous and co - spatial to g - band imaging in the study of the temporal evolution of bright features in the quiet sun . in the present work we report further results obtained from the same analysis concerning the relation between magnetic filling factor and brightness of g - band bright features .",

    "their linear dimensions range between @xmath57  arcsec up to @xmath58  arcsec .",
    "they appear in a great variety of shapes : from the point - like ( at the angular resolution of the g - band data ) to the extended and elongated ( e.g. , the feature in the center of the fov in the upper panel of fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the pixel - by - pixel correlation between stokes @xmath4 amplitude , magnetic filling factor @xmath48 , and g - band intensity @xmath3 ( normalized to the average intensity of the whole time sequence ) along slices extracted from the analyzed dataset .",

    "stokes @xmath4 profiles from both observations and the inversion analysis for selected positions along the slices are also represented in the figure .",
    "these profiles are well fitted by the sir code under the adopted inversion hypotheses (   [ methods ] ) . in the two panels of the figure",
    "the variation of the g - band intensity is found to be in correlation with both stokes @xmath4 amplitude and @xmath48 , while the magnetic field strength does not show any correlation with these quantities ; in fact , it slightly varies around @xmath74  kg .",
    "the two cases reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are representative of a point - like bright feature in an intergranular lane ( upper panel ) , and an extended bright feature in an intergranular lane ( lower panel ) .    the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] displays the different capabilities of g - band and spectropolarimetric data in resolving the properties of bright magnetic features .",
    "in fact , the bright feature is found to be @xmath75  arcsec wide , i.e. , four pixels in g - band data , while the polarization signal is spread over a region of @xmath76  arcsec , i.e. four pixel in spectropolarimetric data .",
    "this is a good example of a magnetic feature whose dimension is close to the limit of the angular resolution of spectropolarimetric data (   [ data ] ) .",
    "according to the criterion described in   [ methods ] , we inverted the profiles of three of these four pixels , i.e. , positions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 where we measured approximatively @xmath74  kg , and a filling factor approximately of @xmath80% .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] a horizontal slice is extracted in correspondence with a strongly magnetized intergranular lane .",
    "the increase of brightness of the feature from position @xmath81 to @xmath78 is correlated with the increase of the magnetic filling factor , that reaches values above @xmath8% .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 amplitude variation measured in positions @xmath81 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 is also evidently correlated with the g - band intensity variation found along the slice .",
    "the plots also show that quite high values for both magnetic filling factor and magnetic field intensity are found in the dark part of the intergranular lane ( positions @xmath79 to @xmath82 ) .",
    "in particular , we notice that at positions @xmath81 and @xmath79 the estimated filling factor values are similar ( about 20@xmath83 ) , while the observed g - band intensities are quite different .",
    "this difference has to be ascribed to the spurious contributions to the polarimetric signal in pixel @xmath79 from the adjacent magnetized pixels ( the two bright features right at the left and below position @xmath84 $ ]  arcsec in the g - band subfield ) .",
    "the correlation between the magnetic filling factor and the g - band intensity shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ]  and  [ fig4 ] is found for all the bright features observed along the time sequence and selected by the automatic procedure . as a further example , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we report the temporal variation of both brightness and magnetic filling factor in a process of merging of faint bright features in a single high brightness feature . to derive the plots in such a figure we focused on the properties of the pixels around the strongest stokes @xmath4 signal in the selected subfield ( white square on g - band images ) .",
    "this choice was necessary since for the first five instants many distinct bright features were recognized by the automatic procedure and this does not allow one to define a unique temporal evolution . from the plot we can recognize a correlation between the increase of brightness and magnetic filling factor .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] such a correlation is made explicit by the scatter plot relating @xmath27 and the average filling factor @xmath38 calculated over the features selected by the automatic procedure .",
    "also in this scatter plot we report the result of an exponential fit performed adopting the function @xmath85 .",
    "the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 derived from the fit are reported in table  [ tabfit ] .",
    "a simple test of the consistency of the results obtained from the fits can be done by comparing the values of @xmath68 and @xmath87 ( second and third lines of table  [ tabfit ] ) .",
    "in fact , if we consider @xmath88  kg as the typical field strength value derived from the inversions , we find that the values reported in table  [ tabfit ] satisfy @xmath89  g ) .",
    "this relation stems from the fact that @xmath68 and @xmath87 are the inverse of a magnetic flux density and a magnetic filling factor , respectively .",
    "the automatic identification algorithm applied on g - band filtergrams allows us to estimate that @xmath90% of the dataset fov is occupied by bright features .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the value reported by @xcite for the quiet photosphere observed at @xmath91  arcsec angular resolution .",
    "as expected , the sir inversion retrieves kg fields where g - band bright features are found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this co - spatiality , here presented only for three examples of features in the fov , is common to all the bright features individuated in the dataset ( see * ? ? ? * for three more examples of small features ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric data have a psf with a fwhm of @xmath92  arcsec , as can be deduced by the shape of the @xmath93 maximum amplitude showed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "therefore , the low filling factor retrieved by the spectropolarimetric inversion can be ascribed to the intrinsic size of the magnetic counterparts of the g - band bright features and/or to the psf shape . even considering the several effects which can contribute to a psf with extended tails , namely , the part of the incoming aberrations not corrected by the ao , scattered light in the optical path or by the atmosphere , and defects in the image calibration pipeline , it seems unreasonable that the psf effect is the dominant one , as we should have a psf with extremely extended tails . moreover , for the case represented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the filling factors found are compatible with a magnetic feature almost filling a single ibis pixel ( @xmath94  arcsec ) spread by a @xmath95  arcsec fwhm wide psf . therefore , we interpret the @xmath96% filling factors found for the extended bright feature ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  and lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) as a signature of unresolved magnetic features",
    ". a deeper analysis of the psf convolution effects on spectropolarimetric inversions will be the topic of a forthcoming paper .    from the unsigned flux density histogram",
    ", we can infer that the most probable unsigned flux density of the bright features is approximatively @xmath69  g ( fig .  [ fig2 ] , right panels ) .",
    "this value is about twice the value obtained by @xcite , but is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the disagreement among the results can stem from the different spatial resolution of the magnetograms : the spectropolarimetric data employed in @xcite had a spatial resolution of about @xmath49  arcsec , while the magnetograms used in @xcite had a @xmath97  arcsec spatial resolution , much closer to that of our dataset .    when plotting the g - band intensity vs. the magnetic flux density ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , central panel ) , we find that the g - band intensity seems to saturate for values of @xmath98  g. we can compare this plot with fig .  12 of @xcite and the g - band contrast of identified magnetic brightening as a function of the peak magnetic flux density in fig .  9 of @xcite , with the caveat that the authors considered peak quantities instead of average quantities .",
    "the scatter plot relating the g - band contrast and the total integrated polarization reported by @xcite also shows an evident saturation of the contrast around @xmath99 for the reported values of the total polarization . in those plots ,",
    "even if the contrast values are in agreement with the ones we measured , the authors did not find any relation between the two quantities .",
    "we can note , however , that our statistics is much richer than in @xcite .",
    "such a difference in the statistics stems from two main facts .",
    "the first is that we analyzed @xmath100 sets of co - spatial and co - temporal g - band and spectropolarimetric data , while in @xcite @xmath101 sets were available .",
    "moreover , different procedures for the selection of bright features were adopted ; in @xcite the authors specify that their procedure usually leads to the selection of extended patches that could be divided in smaller ones , this caused an important reduction of the total number of selected bright features .",
    "in particular , the latter two works lack statistics exactly for low magnetic flux densities and try to fit their scatter plots with linear functions , while the former , on the contrary , only shows magnetic flux densities below @xmath102  g.    commenting the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( left panel ) , the increase of g - band intensity with the increase of the size of bright features is in general agreement with previous results from high spatial resolution observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the g - band contrast saturation values reported are usually between @xmath103 and @xmath72 for disk - center observations , nevertheless , due to the large scatter of data , different interpretations of the results have been suggested . in @xcite and @xcite for instance , the increase was within the dispersion of the results and the authors concluded that no clear trend of intensity as a function of size was observed , the contrast being essentially constant .",
    "@xcite showed instead that their results can be fitted by a straight line .",
    "@xcite reported a clear increase of contrast with size and fitted the results with a polynomial function of third degree .",
    "the results presented in @xcite are an exception in this context , since the authors reported a decrease of contrast for bright features larger than _ hinode _ resolution .",
    "the authors interpreted this trend as an effect of the segmentation algorithm employed to detect the analyzed features .",
    "close inspection of all these data ( with the exception of the ones in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveals an increase of contrast when the size of the feature is comparable with the dataset resolution and a saturation at the largest sizes .",
    "this is in agreement with our finding and we can notice that even the threshold spatial scale value of contrast saturation that we obtain from our analyses is compatible with previously presented results .",
    "in fact , assuming radial symmetry for the selected features , we find a threshold size value of approximately @xmath104  arcsec  @xmath105  km , in agreement with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , when taking into account the different spatial resolution of the data .",
    "this contrast / size relation is in apparent disagreement with classical flux tube models , according to which contrast decreases with the size of the magnetic feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite showed that this effect can be interpreted as a signature of unresolved magnetic features .",
    "the authors , using a two - dimension numerical model of isolated and clustered magnetic flux tubes , simulated the emergent intensity for different cluster dimensions at different angular resolutions .",
    "they found an exponential like relationship between size and continuum contrast , which saturated for cluster diameters larger than twice the spatial resolution of the observations .",
    "this picture is also corroborated by the fact that the finite spatial resolution of observations mostly affects small size features : the smaller the feature the larger is the reduction of its contrast with the decrease of spatial resolution .",
    "larger features are instead less affected , thus explaining the general agreement of contrast values presented in the literature at the saturation .",
    "the work of @xcite , which showed that both the @xmath106  nm continuum contrast and the g - band contrast of bright features saturate at the same spatial scale , allows us to directly compare our result with @xcite and the two results seem to match quite congruously . in fact , we found the saturation for @xmath107  arcsec@xmath60 ( table  [ tabfit ] ) , for which we can calculate an equivalent diameter of @xmath108  arcsec , i.e. about twice the spatial resolution of our g - band dataset .",
    "the plot reported in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , showing the relation between magnetic filling factor and g - band intensity found in our data , also supports the idea of the presence of unresolved magnetic features in our observations .",
    "we remember that , only the stokes profiles cospatial with pixels which show g - band brightness enhancement have been considered to define the plot and that the angular resolution of the spectropolarimetric data has been estimated to be @xmath92  arcsec . from these inversions , it follows that filling factor values are mostly @xmath109% and only a small fraction of the bright features present filling factors above @xmath110% . beside this",
    ", the g - band filtergrams have a spatial resolution of @xmath57  arcsec , therefore in these images we can resolve bright features that are as small as @xmath111% of the spectropolarimetric data pixel .",
    "the low values of the filling factor suggest that the smallest scale bright features are smaller than @xmath112  arcsec .",
    "the variation of the g - band intensity for point - like features ( @xmath113  arcsec@xmath60 ) supports this idea : fully resolved bright features should not change their intensity with their dimension .",
    "we recall that , in g - band bright features , the brightness enhancement occurs because of the local evacuation induced by the high magnetic pressure .",
    "we can assume that increasing the magnetic filling factor means enlarging the evacuated region in our pixel and therefore interpret the plots of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig8 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] with the consequent enhancement of the number of photons that emerge from hot deep layers in the photosphere in the pixels forming the bright feature under examination .",
    "these arguments , combined with the g - band intensity saturation found for @xmath114  arcsec@xmath60 and @xmath115% , suggest that the larger g - band bright features can be thought as clusters of kg `` elementary bright points '' having typical dimension @xmath116  arcsec .",
    "this is in full agreement with @xcite .    from our inversion analysis",
    "we conclude on the role of the magnetic filling factor of kg fields in the formation of g - band bright features ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) : the larger the magnetic filling factor the brighter the feature . to explain our findings",
    ", we can refer to @xcite .",
    "the authors commented about the observation of g - band bright features in quiet sun ( inter - network ) regions : _ `` we conclude that , even though the inter - network bright points may momentarily become invisible , the magnetic field element remains and may become bright again at some later time .",
    "this agrees well with the conclusion of @xcite that magnetism is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the formation of a network bright point''_. the results here presented in   [ results ] complement their argumentation . in terms of the spatial extension of kg flux tube clusters the sentence can be reworded as : the larger the cluster the brighter it will appear , but , once the cluster dimensions are comparable with the spatial resolution of the observations , the brightness saturates . from this",
    "follows that small g - band bright features can be momentarily invisible simply because the local spatial organization of kg fields is temporarily changed , for example , through the action of the photospheric dynamics or because the spatial resolution decreases due to seeing .",
    "this affects the strongest the brightness of point - like features ( as already shown in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also can induce the internal brightness variation of large features ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) . in the recent @xcite the measure of bright feature abundance in the quiet sun",
    "is based on the concept that small scale faint features can be extremely variable in time .",
    "applying an identification procedure that makes use of @xmath112  arcsec angular resolution g - band filtergrams time sequences , the authors were able to rise the estimate of g - band bright feature abundance of a factor three , i.e. , up to @xmath117 bps every @xmath16  arcsec@xmath118 .",
    "it is worth also to focus on recent alternative interpretations of the magnetic structure of photospheric bright features . in the last decade",
    "many works based on modern mhd simulations performed with the muram code have been dedicated to the study of g - band bright features @xcite .",
    "these were able to reproduce the photometric properties of g - band observations and to confirm the association between local brightness enhancement and small scale kg concentrations .",
    "in all these works a common figure for the magnetic structure of bright features emerges : at @xmath110  km spatial resolution these are `` elongated sheet - like '' features .",
    "no evidence of internal structuring , e.g. , through many point - like features is found . in agreement with this interpretation",
    ", @xcite reported that no evidence of internal structuring was found for bright features analyzed in both @xmath119 resolution g - band images and @xmath22 resolution magnetograms obtained at sst .",
    "in contrast with our interpretation , the authors put forward that an internal variation of brightness of extended bright features can be explained via an internal variation of field strength instead of magnetic filling factor . in the recent work of @xcite the authors analyzed full stokes measurements performed through crisp at solar swedish tower ( sst ) with @xmath120  arcsec angular resolution .",
    "on the same line of @xcite , the authors analyzed stokes @xmath4 profiles adopting a milne - eddington code and by imposing the magnetic filling factor to be equal to unity , i.e. , considering magnetic flux concentrations to be resolved in their observations . in their work",
    "the authors properly discussed this choice specifying that their measure of the magnetic field should be considered either as a measure of the magnetic flux density ( as in * ? ? ? * ) or as a measure of a roughly defined average of the magnetic field strength . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach considers the effect of the limited spatial resolution in the inversion analysis of @xmath95  arcsec spatial resolution data ; this allows us to separate the contribution of the field strength and the magnetic filling factor .",
    "the works of @xcite , based on crisp data , @xcite and other observations performed with sunrise / imax , represent the first effort in trying to understand the photospheric magnetism at @xmath121 angular resolution .",
    "such observations will shed new light in the study of the structuring of the photospheric magnetic field .    as a conclusive part of our discussion we want to point out two recent works which support a fine structuring of photospheric bright features .",
    "in the first one , @xcite , the observation of point - like bright features in @xmath122 resolution observations at @xmath123  nm is reported , while no sheet - like features were observed .",
    "the second one is the work of @xcite in which processes of magnetic intensification are simulated via the muram code .",
    "such processes form stable point - like ( i.e. , @xmath7 wide ) kg features which are able to produce a continuum brightness enhancement at @xmath12  nm .",
    "these are different from the strong sheet - like kg concentrations produced by advecting field lines in downflow regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from our point of view , it could be extremely interesting an in - depth study of the spatial and temporal evolution of such kg elements to check whether they can produce , by grouping , extended @xmath124 wide bright features .",
    "we have presented new results from the analysis of observations with ibis in spectropolarimetric mode .",
    "these are , at the same time , complementary and corroborative of the results reported in @xcite .",
    "namely , in the present work we confirm the correlation between bright feature brightness and kg magnetic filling factor found in the analysis of three particular cases of temporal evolution of small - scale features in @xcite : the higher the local kg filling factor the brighter the g - band feature .",
    "this conclusion , first evinced by the detailed analysis of an extended bright feature ( i.e. , a small network patch ) , has been validated by a statistical study of the properties of all the bright features observed in the fov at any instant of the time sequence .",
    "considering the angular resolution of our spectropolarimetric ( @xmath92  arcsec ) and g - band ( @xmath57  arcsec ) data , we put forward the upper limit of @xmath57  arcsec for the typical dimension over which the `` elementary g - band bright features '' ( i.e. , bright points ) are formed . adopting this figure ,",
    "larger g - band bright features could be thought to be clusters of bright points ( in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "such substructuring of bright features can be just inferred from @xmath95  arcsec angular resolution ibis spectropolarimetric data .",
    "new higher angular resolution observations will offer to the solar community the opportunity to conclude on the magnetic structure of g - band bright features .",
