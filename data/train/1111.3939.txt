    "an effect produced by introduction of structural randomness is perhaps one of the first aspects one would be willing to investigate , once the properties of the model of interest have been successfully studied on regular structures .",
    "while computer experiment data keep accumulating for diverse models with structural disorder , this problem is often a real challenge to the theory , though .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional @xmath1 model ( sometimes referred to as the planar rotator model ) , which hamiltonian is traditionally written as @xmath10 with the sum spanning the pairs of nearest neighbors in a square lattice of @xmath11 sites , @xmath12 being the coupling strength , and the polar angle @xmath13 representing the only degree of freedom which can be attributed to a spin of unit length rotating in a plane .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath1 model is remarkable for its critical properties , as this particular combination of lattice dimensionality and spin symmetry leads to the existence of a finite range of temperatures in which the system exhibits critical - like behaviour [ berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase ] @xcite ; most notably , the spin - spin correlation function decays as a power law with a temperature dependent exponent @xmath2 below the bkt transition point @xmath14 .    in the low temperature limit , where the spin - wave approximation ( swa ) is applicable , i. e. the cosine in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be replaced by a quadratic expression without affecting the system properties significantly ,",
    "one arrives easily at a power law form of the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath15 , with an exponent linearly dependent on temperature @xcite : @xmath16 it is known , however , that as the temperature increases , the real exponent increases non - linearly with temperature , so that it assumes the exact value of @xmath17 at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "given the two both theoretically and experimentally ( computer experiment is meant here ) acknowledged facts that the value of the exponent @xmath18 at the bkt transition point can not be changed by structural dilution ( see , for example , @xcite ) whereas the value of the bkt transition temperature is reduced by dilution and depends on its concentration @xcite , one can already make a conclusion that the value of @xmath18 below the bkt point should depend not only on temperature but on dilution concentration as well .",
    "it is also clear that @xmath18 should increase with dilution concentration for @xmath19",
    ". it can be interpreted as the increase of effective temperature ( decrease of effective interaction ) due to dilution ..    a number of works have touched this question , mostly using computer simulations . for site dilution ,",
    "when some fraction of sites is excluded from hamiltonian ( [ h_2dxy ] ) , see @xcite , and for bond dilution , when some fraction of bonds is removed from ( [ h_2dxy ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "the present study logically continues the theoretical part of @xcite , making a significant advance  @xcite and covering both the site and bond dilution cases .",
    "the focus is on the behavior of the spin - spin correlation function and the searched quantity is the dilution concentration @xmath4 dependent exponent @xmath18 of the correlation function power - law decay .",
    "it is natural to assume that the exponent @xmath20 is an analytic function with respect to @xmath4 , away from the percolation threshold .",
    "below , @xmath4 will denote the fraction of removed bonds or sites , depending on what dilution type is considered .",
    "thus , @xmath18 can be presented as a power series @xmath21 for small dilution concentrations @xmath4 , it is enough to know the slope @xmath22 to estimate the value of exponent @xmath18 with good precision .",
    "so , in our derivation we drop terms that lead to higher order terms in @xmath4 in ( [ eta_series ] ) .    as more simple and transparent from the technical point of view case , bond dilution is considered first in section [ ii ] , where the spin - spin correlation function is calculated up to the contributions linear in dilution concentration @xmath4 and temperature @xmath23 .",

    "then one shall compare the exponent @xmath160 and ( [ eta_b.d . ] ) for @xmath161 , which means that we look at the systems with the same number of missing bonds ( although in the case of site dilution all missing bonds are connected in unbreakable groups of four ) .",
    "one can notice that @xmath162 for the same concentration of missing bonds , which is well expected , since the disordering effect must be stronger for a completely random distribution of removed bonds in comparison to the site dilution case when removed bonds are connected in groups of four , and only these groups are distributed randomly then .",
    "it also should be mentioned that , in principle , taking higher order terms in dilution concentration @xmath4 in ( [ expansion_in_p ] ) , one would expect to arrive at the end at the correlation function with exponent @xmath163 represented by a series in powers of @xmath4 divergent at the percolation threshold value @xmath164 for the square lattice [ which is exactly @xmath165 for bond dilution and @xmath166 for site dilution ( see , for example , @xcite ) ] .",
