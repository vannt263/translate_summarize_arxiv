    "an important class of instabilities of one - dimensional patterns are side - band instabilities .",
    "the most important one among them is the eckhaus instability @xcite which is a monotonic long - wave instability that renders the pattern unstable with respect to infinitesimal compressions and dilatations .",
    "its onset can be characterized by the vanishing phase diffusion coefficient @xcite . near the threshold , where the pattern can be described by a real ( dissipative ) ginzburg  landau ( gl ) equation ,",
    "the eckhaus instability arises generically if the deviation @xmath0 of the wave - number of the pattern from that corresponding to the bifurcation point exceeds a certain value , i.e. if @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the deviation of the control parameter from the threshold . a similar instability of wave patterns ( e.g. described by the complex gl equation ) is usually referred to as the benjamin - feir instability @xcite .",
    "typically , the eckhaus instability restricts the range of allowed wave numbers of the pattern , i.e. its nonlinear evolution eventually brings the system back to the stable range of wave numbers .",
    "the eckhaus instability of periodic patterns has been studied extensively , both theoretically and experimentally , in various pattern - forming systems , such as rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite , convection in binary mixtures @xcite , taylor vortex flow @xcite , electrohydrodynamic convection in nematics @xcite , directional solidification @xcite . even quite close to the threshold",
    ", the boundaries of the eckhaus instability of stationary periodic patterns can differ from ( [ ech ] ) due to various factors , such as the system confinement @xcite , subcritical character of the instability @xcite , the shape of the neutral stability curve @xcite , the effect of nonlinearity @xcite and resonances @xcite , the presence of random fluctuations @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking ( e.g.due to rotation ) @xcite , etc .",
    "although the eckhaus instability is the most common one - dimensional side - band instability , others are possible as well . in the present paper we show that spatially periodic patterns arising due to marangoni convection in a liquid layer with a deformable free surface heated from below can possess additional side - band instabilities : a short - scale steady side - band instability and a long - scale oscillatory side - band instability .",
    "an important feature of this system is the presence of _ two _ primary modes of instability ( generating the marangoni convection itself ) : a long - scale instability ( with zero wave - number ) connected with the deformation of the free surface , and short - scale convection ( with a finite wave - number ) governed by surface tension gradients .",
    "a typical neutral stability curve for this system has two minima , corresponding to _ two _ critical marangoni numbers @xcite .",
    "the one minimum , ma@xmath3 , is at a zero wave - number and corresponds to a long - scale instability driven by deformation of the free surface coupled with surface tension gradients .",
    "the other minimum , ma@xmath4 , is at a non - zero wave - number , and corresponds to a short - scale instability caused by surface tension gradients only ( surface deformations are not important in this regime ) .",
    "when the two thresholds are close to each other , the nonlinear interaction between the two modes of marangoni instability with different scales can lead to various secondary instabilities of the short - scale convection generating various stationary and temporally modulated patterns @xcite . the nonlinear evolution and interaction of the two modes",
    "is described by a system of coupled equations which can be written in the following scaled form @xcite : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the amplitude of the short - scale convection , @xmath7 is the deformation of the free surface , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are long - scale space coordinate and slow time .",
    "the form of the equation for @xmath7 is determined by the fact that @xmath7 is conserved due to mass conservation . in the non - conserved case",
    "certain aspects of the interaction between short- and long - scale structures has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is proportional to the difference between the two thresholds , @xmath11 characterizes the effect of the laplace pressure , and @xmath12 is the computable coupling parameter which was shown to be positive @xcite .",
    "note that for the terms in the second equation in ( [ ah ] ) to be of the same order , the capillary number , which parameter @xmath13 is proportional to , has to be large ( which is indeed the case in most of experimental conditions ) .",
    "the coupling between @xmath6 and @xmath7 reflects the following mechanism of the modes interaction : as expressed by the coupling term in the first equation , the short - scale convection is more intensive beneath surface elevations ; since @xmath12 , the convection , in turn , suppresses the long - scale deformational mode by changing the average surface temperature or concentration @xcite .",
    "this stabilization effect of the short - scale convection mode allows the difference between the critical marangoni numbers ma@xmath3 and ma@xmath4 to be @xmath14 and still the deformational instability to be restricted to long scales and have small growth rate",
    ". however , this stabilization fails if ma@xmath15ma@xmath3 is too large ( see @xcite ) .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the effect of the mode interaction on the stability of the short - scale convection was studied only in the vicinity of the band center ( @xmath16 ) . in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis to the full wave - number band of the short - scale convection and show that the interaction of the two modes strongly affects the width of the band and can even lead to a change of the type of the instability .",
    "we consider the effect of surface deformations on the stability of short - scale convection rolls with wave - numbers lying within an @xmath17 range at small supercriticality ( ma@xmath18ma@xmath4)/ma@xmath19 .",
    "this convection pattern is described by the following stationary solution of eq.([ah ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimensionless ( in units of the characteristic width @xmath22 of the band of excited wave - numbers ) deviation from the critical wave - number corresponding to the threshold ma = ma@xmath4 of the short - scale instability .",
    "consider a perturbed solution in the form @xmath23 where asterisks denote complex conjugates . substituting ( [ ptrb ] ) in system ( [ ah ] ) yields the following implicit dispersion relation for the side - band instability : @xmath24 where @xmath25 we see that the interaction of the two modes leads to a _",
    "equation for the eigenvalues defining the limits of the side - band instability ( similar , say , to the case of the eckhaus instability of a hexagonal pattern when there is a coupling between three waves @xcite ) . in our case",
    ", we have the coupling between two side - band modes , which correspond to longitudinal compression - dilatation waves propagating in opposite directions if @xmath26 is complex , and the surface deformation .",
    "according to the routh - hurwitz criterion , it follows from ( [ disp ] ) that the stationary solution ( [ aq ] ) is stable if @xmath27    the analysis of conditions ( [ cond ] ) shows that , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath28 , the side - band instability in this system can be either long - wave or short - wave , monotonic or oscillatory , and the range of @xmath0 where the solution ( [ aq ] ) is stable can be either wider or narrower than the standard eckhaus interval defined by ( [ ech ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of various possibilities is very complicated since the stability of the system is governed by four parameters , @xmath29 .",
    "we shall dwell therefore mostly on the case when the solution ( [ aq ] ) becomes unstable with respect to perturbations with infinitesimal wave - number .",
    "the corresponding stability limits can be determined from ( [ cond ] ) in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "it is , however , more instructive to obtain this result using the so - called _ phase approximation _ which is based on the observation that in the long - wave limit the evolution of the amplitude of the convection pattern is slaved to the evolution of its phase @xcite .",
    "thus , we set @xmath31 , and obtain from eq.([ah ] ) for the amplitude correction @xmath32 @xmath33 in our case , the amplitude near the instability threshold is slaved to both the phase @xmath34 and the surface deformation @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of these two variables is described by the following system of coupled equations : @xmath35 introducing the wave - number deviation , @xmath36 , one can rewrite system ( [ fih ] ) in the form of the coupled diffusion equations : @xmath37 where @xmath38 the system is stable if all eigenvalues of matrix @xmath39 have negative real parts .",
    "the characteristic equation leads to the following stability conditions : @xmath40    it should be noted that this system obtained in the long - wave limit does not give the complete stability information .",
    "it can be shown that there always exists an interval of @xmath10 where the relevant instability is a _ short - wave _ instability that can be either monotonic or oscillatory .",
    "we shall dwell on the case when the instability is long - wave in the band center , and no short - wave _ oscillatory _ instability arises .",
    "a typical stability diagram is shown in fig.1 for @xmath41 .",
    "fig.1 is true provided @xmath42 ( see ref.@xcite ) and @xmath13 is larger than a certain value @xmath43 , respectively ( for @xmath44 .",
    "fig.1 presents the region in the plane @xmath45 in which the solution ( [ aq ] ) is stable .",
    "this region is bounded by the lines ab , bc , cd and de . the lines ab and de are the loci of @xmath46 and correspond to a _",
    "monotonic _ long - wave instability ( cf .",
    "( [ stab2 ] ) ) , while the line cd is the locus of @xmath47 and corresponds to an _ oscillatory _ long - wave instability ( cf .",
    "( [ stab1 ] ) ) .",
    "the line bc corresponds to a monotonic _ short - wave _ instability and can be found analytically from the condition @xmath48 ( see eq.([cond ] ) ) ( it is , however , too cumbersome to be reproduced here ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the threshold of the standard eckhaus instability , @xmath49 .",
    "the coordinates of the points a , b , c , d , and e can be found analytically : a@xmath50 , b@xmath51 , d@xmath52 , e@xmath53 ; the expressions for the coordinates of the point c are very lengthy ( for @xmath41 in fig.1 , c@xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , due to the coupling between the phase evolution and the surface deformation , both the interval of wave - numbers corresponding to stable stationary convection described by eq.([aq ] ) and the type of its instability depend on the parameter @xmath10 , i.e. on the difference between the two thresholds of the marangoni instability , ma@xmath15ma@xmath3 .",
    "there are four particular values of @xmath55 , corresponding to the points b , c , e , d in fig.1 , respectively , which define four regions where qualitatively different instabilities are observed .",
    "these regions in the @xmath56-parameter plane are shown in fig.2 for @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 , solution ( [ aq ] ) is stable when @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath12 in our case , the stability interval for @xmath0 is _ larger _ than in the case of the ordinary eckhaus instability , @xmath60 ; part of the energy of phase perturbations is transferred to the damped long - scale deformational mode .",
    "this suppresses the eckhaus instability and makes the stability interval for @xmath0 larger .",
    "outside this interval of @xmath0 , solution ( [ aq ] ) is unstable and the instability is _ monotonic _ and _ long - wave _ , like in the standard case with no surface deformation . in the limit @xmath61 , surface deformations are damped very strongly , and the eckhaus interval tends to its ordinary value .",
    "when @xmath62 , the stability threshold for @xmath0 is determined by a cumbersome function of @xmath13 and @xmath63 which we do not represent here .",
    "this threshold is still larger than @xmath64 .",
    "the instability in this case is also monotonic , but _ short - wave_. at the point b the modulation wave number @xmath65 goes to zero and the short - wave instability continuously changes over to a long - wave instability .",
    "this shows that the short - wave instability is not due to a subharmonic resonance as it has been found , e.g. , in taylor vortex flow @xcite .",
    "when @xmath66 , the stability interval for @xmath0 is given by @xmath67 .",
    "the instability in this case is _ oscillatory _ and _ long - wave _ and can lead to slow oscillations of the wave - number of the short - scale roll pattern coupled with oscillations of the surface deformation ( see sec.3.2 below ) .    at @xmath68 ,",
    "the stability region coincides with the ordinary eckhaus interval , @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath69 , the roll pattern corresponding to the band center , @xmath70 , becomes unstable .",
    "this coincides with the results in @xcite . nevertheless , as long as @xmath71 , a _",
    "stable _ pattern _ still exists _ under these conditions , but with a _ modified _ wave - number lying in the interval @xmath72 .",
    "the lower boundary of this interval corresponds to the long - wave _ monotonic _ instability ( i.e. the usual eckhaus instability ) while the upper one to the long - wave _ oscillatory _ instability .",
    "this splitting of the stable band into two sub - bands is reminiscent of a situation encountered in parametrically excited standing waves : under certain conditions the wave numbers in the center of the band become eckhaus - unstable while off - center wave numbers remain stable .",
    "such a splitting was found to lead to the formation of stable kinks in the wave number separating domains with different wave numbers @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of the present system in this regime will be discussed briefly below .",
    "for @xmath73 , solution ( [ aq ] ) is unstable at any wave number due to the deformational instability of the surface .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath10 , i.e. on the difference between the threshold ma@xmath4 of the short - scale convection and that of the long - scale deformational instability ( ma@xmath3 ) , the band of stable wave numbers can take on two qualitatively different forms .",
    "for @xmath74 the band is contiguous ( hashed area in fig.3a ) while for @xmath75 convection is stable within two disconnected wave - number bands ( hashed area in fig.3b ) .",
    "in conclusion of this section let us note that if the parameter @xmath13 is _ not _ large enough , the _ oscillatory short - wave _ side - band instability comes into play . in this case ,",
    "the stability region shown in fig.1 slightly changes : there appears a new boundary corresponding to this short - wave oscillatory side - band instability which cuts off the corner at the point c and connects two boundaries bc and cd corresponding to the short - wave monotonic and to the long - scale oscillatory side - band instabilities , respectively .",
    "in this section we shall study the nonlinear evolution of the long - wave instability near the thresholds given by the curves ab , cd and de in fig.1 .",
    "the monotonic long - wave instability threshold corresponds to the curves ab and de in fig.1 and is given by @xmath76 we use the following scaling : @xmath77 , and apply the following ansatz : @xmath78    substituting ( [ arofi ] ) in system ( [ ah ] ) , one obtains in the first order that the change in the local wave - number , @xmath79 , is proportional to the surface deformation @xmath80 , @xmath81 proceeding to the sixth order , we obtain the following nonlinear evolution equation for the surface deformation @xmath80 : @xmath82 where @xmath83    the evolution equation for the long - wave modulation of the wave - number @xmath84 can be obtained from eq.([evh ] ) by a simple renormalization of the coefficient @xmath85 ( cf .",
    "( [ k1h1 m ] ) ) . when @xmath61 , the surface is undeformable , and the coefficients in the equation for @xmath84 tend to those of the nonlinear evolution equation describing an ordinary eckhaus instability in the real gl equation .",
    "it can be shown that the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 are positive ( in the parameter region where the instability is long - wave ) , and the instability is subcritical .",
    "therefore , all periodic solutions of ( [ evh ] ) blow up beyond the stability limit @xmath88 indicating a break - down of ( [ evh ] ) .",
    "the same happens in the case of the _ monotonic short - scale _ instability , corresponding to the curve bc in fig.1 ; our computations show that it is also subcritical .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the full amplitude equations ( [ ah ] ) show that different physical processes occur when crossing the lines ac and de in fig.1 , respectively .",
    "this is related to the fact that along ac the deformational mode is linearly damped ( @xmath74 ) , whereas along de it is excited ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "figs.4,5 show typical results of numerical simulations of ( [ ah ] ) .",
    "fig.4 shows the evolution of the pattern occurring when the line ac is crossed .",
    "while the surface deformation and the amplitude of the short - scale convection remain regular for all times , the wave - number goes through a true singularity .",
    "it signifies a phase slip , which reduces the total phase in the system by @xmath90 . following this phase slip",
    ", the pattern relaxes to a periodic pattern with a wave - number in the stable band .",
    "the evolution below the line de is shown in fig.5 . here",
    "the deformational mode is excited ; it has been shown previously that the instability is subcritical at @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the simulation of the coupled amplitude equations ( [ ah ] ) indicates that the instability does indeed not saturate which results in a singularity in the surface deformation and in the amplitude of the short - scale convection .",
    "thus , even the amplitude equations ( [ ah ] ) become invalid .",
    "this result suggests a dry - out of the fluid film as has been observed experimentally @xcite .    despite the splitting of the wave - number band",
    ", no stable wave - number kinks could be found .",
    "this indicates that the higher - order contributions to the phase equation ( [ evh ] ) , which were not calculated , differ from those arising solely from a non - monotonicity of the phase diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that at the point d the coefficients @xmath91 and @xmath87 tend to infinity , while at the point e the coefficient @xmath92 vanishes regardless of the value of @xmath93 ; the system dynamics in the vicinity of these points is more complex ; it can not be described by eq.([evh ] ) and requires separate analysis .",
    "along line cd in fig.1 an oscillatory long - wave instability arises .",
    "its threshold is given by @xmath94 to study its nonlinear behavior we set @xmath95 , introduce the slow coordinates @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and expand @xmath98 with @xmath99 substituting ( [ expo ] ) in system ( [ ah ] ) , we obtain in the first order a linear system for @xmath80 and @xmath100 which , after appropriate diagonalization , can be reduced to a linear free schrdinger equation @xmath101 where @xmath102 eq.([schr ] ) describes waves propagating along the convection pattern and modulating its wave - number and the surface deformation .",
    "the phase velocity of the waves @xmath103 depends on the wave number @xmath65 of the modulation , as @xmath104 .",
    "the wave - number @xmath105 and the surface deformation @xmath80 are proportional to each other @xmath106 and there is a phase shift between oscillations of the wave - number and the surface deformation equal to arg@xmath107 .    at the onset of the oscillatory long - wave instability",
    ", a whole band of wave - numbers @xmath108 is excited .",
    "however , a strong ( quadratic ) dispersion of the waves described by ( [ schr ] ) allows only quartic interactions between waves with different wave - numbers within the excited interval .",
    "the evolution of the wave amplitudes can thus be described in the third order of the perturbation theory by a system of landau equations .",
    "a similar situation occured in a study of long - scale oscillatory double - diffusive convection @xcite .    in order to study the wave interaction , we consider two pairs of oppositely propagating waves having wave - numbers @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and present @xmath105 and @xmath80 in the following form : @xmath111+c.c.,\\label{ab}\\\\   \\theta^{\\pm}_{1,2}=\\omega_{0}\\kappa_{1,2}^{2}t_{0}\\pm\\kappa_{1,2}x , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the amplitudes @xmath112 and @xmath113 undergo slow evolution on the time scale @xmath114 .    using ( [ ab ] ) and",
    "( [ expo ] ) , we obtain from ( [ ah ] ) , as solvability conditions in the fourth and in the fifth orders , the following system of landau equations for the amplitudes @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath115    the linear growth rate coefficients @xmath116 and the landau coefficients @xmath117 have the following form : @xmath118 where @xmath119 if @xmath120 .",
    "the landau coefficients @xmath121 are complicated functions of @xmath122 satisfying the relationships @xmath123    the real parts @xmath124 of the functions @xmath125 in eq.([gamlam ] ) are shown in fig.6 as functions of @xmath10 .",
    "they become unbounded in the vicinity of the point d ( @xmath126 ) where system ( [ land ] ) is not valid .    system ( [ land ] ) allows to study the competition between travelling and standing waves .",
    "let us consider two waves with a fixed wave - number propagating in opposite directions .",
    "setting @xmath127 in ( [ land ] ) , we study the stability of the two solutions of system ( [ land ] ) @xmath128 with respect to infinitesimal perturbations of the amplitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the symbols of the landau coefficients in ( [ tw ] ) , ( [ sw ] ) and below denote now only the _ real parts _ of the respective coefficients .",
    "the stability analysis shows that    a)_travelling waves _ are stable if @xmath131    b)_standing waves _ are stable if @xmath132 otherwise , the system undergoes a subcritical instability which may lead to a blow - up and may return the system back to the stable region .",
    "we have performed some numerical simulations of ( [ ah ] ) which support this expectation .",
    "we have found ( see fig.6 ) that in our case ( @xmath133 ) , when @xmath134 standing waves are stable , and when @xmath135 traveling waves are stable . in the rest intervals of @xmath10 within the interval @xmath120 ,",
    "close to the points c and d , both types of waves are subcritically unstable .",
    "let us now study the stability of standing and travelling waves with respect to perturbations with different wave - numbers , i.e. the stability of solutions ( [ tw ] ) , ( [ sw ] ) with respect to perturbations of the amplitudes @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the stability analysis shows that    \\a ) _ travelling waves _ are stable if , besides ( [ t ] ) , the following conditions are fulfilled : @xmath138",
    "\\b ) _ standing waves _ are stable if , besides ( [ s ] ) , the following condition holds : @xmath139    the analysis of conditions ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ s1 ] ) shows that within the intervals defined by ( [ t ] ) and ( [ s ] ) there exist intervals of wave - numbers where the waves are also stable to perturbations with an arbitrary wave - number .",
    "fig.7 shows how these intervals change with the variation of the parameter @xmath10 along curve cd in fig.1 .",
    "it can be seen that standing waves are stable at intermediate wave - numbers , while travelling waves can be stable at infinitesimal wave - number as well .",
    "thus , the oscillatory long - wave eckhaus instability in marangoni convection with deformable interface can generate either standing or travelling compression - dilatation waves propagating along the periodic pattern and modulating its wavelength together with the deformation of the free surface .",
    "typical results of numerical simulations of ( [ ah ] ) are given in fig.8a , b .",
