    "@xcite in various experimental studies the subgap spectrum of hybrid superconductor - quantum dot devices has been analyzed by andreev level spectroscopy @xcite , which allows to measure the andreev addition energies and the total line width of the resonances via the differential conductance .",
    "the coherent dynamics underlying the proximity effect in the dot shows up for example in the waiting time distribution of transport events  @xcite in the normal lead , which exhibits an oscillatory behaviour due to the coherent exchange of cooper pairs between dot and superconductor .",
    "@xcite however , a direct measurement of the waiting time distribution might be challenging and it is therefore interesting to look at alternative possibilities to reveal the coherent tunnelling of cooper pairs between dot and superconductors .",

    "we consider strong coupling between quantum dot and superconductor , while the dot is only weakly coupled to the normal conducting lead .",

    "the kondo correlations due to the coupling with the normal lead are negligible and we can treat the tunnelling with the normal lead to lowest non - vanishing order .",
