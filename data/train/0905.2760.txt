    "in this paper we begin a general study of the _ uniform thickness property _ ( utp ) in the context of iterated torus knots that are embedded in @xmath0 with the standard tight contact structure .",
    "our goal in this study will be to determine the extent to which iterated torus knot types fail to satisfy the utp , and the extent to which this failure leads to cablings that are legendrian or transversally non - simple .",
    "the specific goal of this note is to address both questions by establishing new necessary conditions for the failure of the utp , as well as new necessary conditions for slopes of cablings that are legendrian non - simple . in the process",
    "we will show that , in some sense , most iterated torus knot types are legendrian simple , and many satisfy the utp , including many iterated cablings that begin with knots which fail the utp .",
    "specifically , we will begin by showing that the class of knots that are both legendrian simple and satisfy the utp is closed under cabling , and hence all iterated cablings that begin with negative torus knots are legendrian simple .",
    "we will then study , for arbitrary numbers of iterations , iterated cablings that begin with positive torus knots , and demonstrate the legendrian simplicity of many of these knot types , some of which also satisfy the utp .",
    "our analysis will result in a precise class of iterated torus knot types that may fail the utp , as well as the identification of many solid tori representatives that may fail to thicken .",
    "we will also obtain a precise class of iterated torus knots that may be legendrian non - simple . a forthcoming note , _ studying uniform thickness ii _",
    ", will then more directly address the related problems of determining whether these two classes indeed fail the utp and are legendrian non - simple .    to bring the above goals into focus , we recall the definition of the _ uniform thickness property _ as given by etnyre and honda @xcite . for a knot",
    "type @xmath1 , define the _ contact width _ of @xmath1 to be    @xmath2    in this equation the @xmath3 are solid tori having representatives of @xmath1 as their cores , and @xmath4 refers to the slope of the _ dividing curves _ on the convex torus @xmath5 .",
    "slopes are measured using the preferred framing coming from a seifert surface for @xmath1 , and slopes are calculated so that the longitude has slope @xmath6 ; the supremum is taken over all solid tori @xmath3 representing @xmath1 where @xmath5 is convex .",
    "any knot type @xmath1 satisfies the inequality @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the maximal thurston - bennequin number for @xmath1 .",
    "a knot type @xmath1 satisfies the utp if the following hold :    * @xmath9 . *",
    "every solid torus @xmath3 representing @xmath1 can be thickened to a standard neighborhood of a maximal @xmath10 legendrian knot .    using this definition ,",
    "etnyre and honda identified necessary conditions for the existence of legendrian non - simple iterated torus knot types @xcite .",
    "specifically , they showed that if all iterated torus knots were to satisfy the utp , then they would all be legendrian simple ; hence if some iterated torus knot fails to be legendrian simple , then there must exist an iterated torus knot which fails the utp .",
    "they subsequently established that the @xmath11 torus knot fails the utp and indeed has a cabling which is legendrian non - simple , namely the @xmath12 iterated torus knot .",
    "they also established , for arbitrary numbers of iterations , iterated torus knots that are legendrian simple , where at each iteration the knot type satisfies the utp , and cabling fractions @xmath13 are less than the contact width .    in this note , we extend etnyre and honda s work ; we begin by proving the following theorem :    [ utp theorem ] let @xmath1 be a topological knot type . if @xmath1 is legendrian simple and satisfies the utp , then all of its cablings are legendrian simple and satisfy the utp .",
    "most of the content of this theorem was proved by etnyre and honda in theorems 1.1 and 1.3 in @xcite ; we prove the satisfaction of the utp for cabling fractions @xmath13 that are greater than the contact width . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "using the fact that negative torus knots are legendrian simple and satisfy the utp @xcite , we have the following result :    [ cablings of negative torus knots ] all iterated cabling knot types that begin with negative torus knots are legendrian simple ; that is , if @xmath14 is an iterated torus knot type where @xmath15 is a negative torus knot , then @xmath16 is legendrian simple .",
    "we then undertake an analysis of iterated cablings that begin with positive torus knots , and identify , for arbitrary numbers of iterations , legendrian simple classes of such iterated torus knots . in order to obtain a precise statement of these other results",
    ", we will first need to recall and introduce some terminology .",
    "however , at this point the reader may wish to look ahead to figure [ fig : schematicnewestb2 ] , where in graphical form we combine etnyre and honda s results with ours to provide a summary of what is known concerning the uniform thickness and legendrian classification of iterated torus knots .",
    "recall that for legendrian knots embedded in @xmath0 endowed with the standard tight contact structure , there are two classical invariants of legendrian isotopy classes , namely the thurston - bennequin number , @xmath10 , and the rotation number , @xmath17 . for a given topological knot type , we can represent legendrian isotopy classes by points on a grid whose horizontal axis plots values of @xmath17 and whose vertical axis plots values of @xmath10 .",
    "this plot takes the visual form of a _",
    "legendrian mountain range_. for a given topological knot type , if the ordered pair @xmath18 completely determines the legendrian isotopy classes , then that knot type is said to be _",
    "legendrian simple_. previous examples of legendrian simple knot types include the unknot @xcite , as well as torus knots and the figure eight knot @xcite .",
    "_ iterated torus knots _ , as topological knot types , can be defined recursively .",
    "let 1-iterated torus knots be simply torus knots @xmath15 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 co - prime nonzero integers , and @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the algebraic intersection with a longitude , and @xmath20 is the algebraic intersection with a meridian in the preferred framing for a torus representing the unknot .",
    "then for each @xmath15 torus knot , take a solid torus regular neighborhood @xmath22 ; the boundary of this is a torus , and given a framing we can describe simple closed curves on that torus as co - prime pairs @xmath23 , with @xmath24 . in this way we obtain all 2-iterated torus knots , which we represent as ordered pairs , @xmath25 .",
    "recursively , suppose the @xmath26-iterated torus knots are defined ; we can then take regular neighborhoods of all of these , choose a framing , and form the @xmath17-iterated torus knots as ordered @xmath17-tuples @xmath27 , again with @xmath28 and @xmath29 co - prime , and @xmath30 .    for ease of notation ,",
    "if we are looking at a general @xmath17-iterated torus knot type , we will refer to it as @xmath16 ; a legendrian representative will usually be written as @xmath31 .",
    "note that we will use the letter @xmath17 both for the rotation number and as an index for our iterated torus knots ; context will distinguish between the two uses .",
    "we will study iterated torus knots using two framings .",
    "the first is the standard framing for a torus , where the meridian bounds a disc inside the solid torus , and we use the preferred longitude which bounds a seifert surface in the complement of the solid torus .",
    "we will refer to this framing as @xmath32 .",
    "the second framing is a non - standard framing using a different longitude that comes from the cabling torus .",
    "more precisely , to identify this non - standard longitude on @xmath33 , we first look at @xmath16 as it is embedded in @xmath34 . we take a small neighborhood @xmath35 such that @xmath33 intersects @xmath34 in two parallel simple closed curves .",
    "these curves are longitudes on @xmath33 in this second framing , which we will refer to as @xmath36 .",
    "note that this corresponds to the @xmath36 framing in @xcite , and is well - defined for any cabled knot type .",
    "moreover , for purpose of calculations there is an easy way to change between the two framings , which is presented in @xcite and which we will review in the body of this note .    given a simple closed curve @xmath37 on a torus , measured in some framing as having @xmath38 meridians and @xmath39 longitudes",
    ", we will say this curve has slope of @xmath40 ; i.e. , longitudes over meridians .",
    "therefore we will refer to the longitude in the @xmath36 framing as @xmath41 , and the longitude in the @xmath32 framing as @xmath6 .",
    "the meridian in both framings will have slope @xmath42 .",
    "this way of representing slopes corresponds to that in @xcite ; in short , slopes are the reciprocals of cabling fractions @xmath43 .",
    "a new convention we will be using is that meridians in the standard @xmath32 framing , that is , algebraic intersection with @xmath6 , will be denoted by upper - case @xmath44 . on the other hand , meridians in the non - standard @xmath45 framing , that is , algebraic intersection with @xmath46 ,",
    "will be denoted by lower - case @xmath47 .",
    "given an iterated torus knot type @xmath48 where the @xmath49 s are measured in the @xmath45 framing , we define two quantities , whose meaning will be revealed in the body of this note .",
    "the two quantities are :    @xmath50    note here we use a convention that @xmath51 .",
    "also , if we restrict to the first @xmath52 iterations , that is , to @xmath53 , we have an associated @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for example , @xmath56 .    finally , for convenience in stating our theorems",
    ", we will define a particular class of iterated torus knot types , each member of which we will denote by @xmath57 :    _ @xmath58 is an @xmath17-iterated torus knot type , where we require that @xmath59 , @xmath60 for all @xmath52 , @xmath61 , and for @xmath62 we have @xmath63 ; at each iteration we use the @xmath36 framing .",
    "_    we will show that the following is an equivalent definition for @xmath57 in the @xmath32 framing : form an iterated torus knot by beginning with a positive @xmath15 torus knot , and then at each iteration take cabling fractions @xmath64 greater than @xmath65 .",
    "note also that for @xmath57 we will show that @xmath66 .",
    "we can now state our remaining results ; our first is that the @xmath57 are legendrian simple :    [ main theorem ] each @xmath57 is legendrian simple , and has a legendrian mountain range with a single peak at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    the legendrian classification of the @xmath57 generalizes that of positive torus knots , as their legendrian mountain ranges are vertical translates of those for positive torus knots .",
    "a result of etnyre and honda is that the @xmath11 torus knot fails the utp ; hence many of the @xmath57 are iterated cablings that begin with knots failing the utp .",
    "we then determine more cablings of these @xmath57 that are also legendrian simple , and futhermore satisfy the utp :    [ main theorem 3 ] let @xmath69 be a @xmath70 cabling of @xmath57 , where @xmath71 , as measured in the @xmath36 framing .",
    "then @xmath69 is legendrian simple , @xmath72 , and the legendrian mountain range can be determined based on the legendrian classification of @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , @xmath69 satisfies the utp .",
    "note that by theorem [ utp theorem ] , all iterated cablings beginning with these @xmath69 are legendrian simple .",
    "taken together , these two theorems show that all cablings of @xmath57 with slopes in the complement of the interval @xmath73 $ ] are legendrian simple .",
    "this is not by accident ; it will be shown that the slopes of dividing curves on the boundary of solid tori representing @xmath57 that may fail to thicken will be contained within the interval @xmath74 .",
    "we will prove these two theorems using the @xmath45 framing , as they are stated .",
    "however , after changing from @xmath45 to @xmath32 via a change of coordinates , theorems [ main theorem ] and [ main theorem 3 ] will immediately imply the following corollaries [ fractionslargerthanwidth ] and [ negativecablings ] , respectively , both of which are stated in the @xmath32 framing :    [ fractionslargerthanwidth ] let @xmath75 be an iterated torus knot where @xmath15 is a positive torus knot , and such that @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",

    "we first review some facts about legendrian knots on convex tori . recall that the characteristic foliation induced by the contact structure on a convex torus can be assumed to have a standard form , where there are @xmath88 parallel _ legendrian divides _ and a one - parameter family of _ legendrian rulings_. parallel push - offs of the legendrian divides gives a family of @xmath88 _ dividing curves _ , referred to as @xmath89 . for a particular convex torus ,",

    "but such a bypass would induce a destabilization of @xmath90 , thus increasing its @xmath10 by one  see lemma 4.4 in @xcite . to satisfy the conditions of this lemma",

    "recall that lemma 2.2 in @xcite provides us with a way of calculating @xmath168 from @xmath169 and @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is a convex meridional disc for @xmath172 and @xmath173 is a convex seifert surface for the preferred longitude on @xmath172 .",

    ", we use a formula for @xmath179 given at the end of the proof of corollary 3 in @xcite .",
    "the notation used in that paper is that an iterated torus knot @xmath16 is given by a sequence @xmath180 where @xmath181 , @xmath182 indicates the parity of the cabling ( either positive or negative ) , @xmath183 is a torus knot , and for @xmath184 the @xmath49 represent ( efficient ) geometric intersection with a meridian , while the @xmath185 represent ( efficient ) geometric intersection with a preferred longitude . using this notation from @xcite , therefore ,",
    "the formula of interest is :    @xmath186    we need to translate this formula into our notation . for our @xmath57",
    "we have @xmath187 , since we are cabling positively at each iteration ; also , our @xmath188 corresponds to @xmath189 in @xcite for @xmath184 .",

    "moreover , by taking a positive transverse push - off , this proves @xmath208 .",
    "now in the legendrian mountain range for @xmath57 , the outer left slope contains all legendrian isotopy classes whose positive transverse push - offs are at @xmath209 . by the proof above , this slope must intersect the @xmath68 axis at @xmath210 . since the mountain range is symmetric about the @xmath68 axis , we thus have the following corollary :    the legendrian mountain range for @xmath57 consists of isotopy classes contained in a single peak centered around the line @xmath68 and with height at @xmath210",

    "@xmath439 indicates positive stabilization and @xmath440 means negative stabilization . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath371 and @xmath441 are both at @xmath8 and have the same rotation number , then they must exist in basic slices that are associated to @xmath31 and @xmath442 at @xmath443 and having the same rotation number , as well as the same parity of stabilization for @xmath31 and @xmath442 .",
    "these basic slices are thus contact isotopic since @xmath57 is legendrian simple , yielding a legendrian isotopy from @xmath371 to @xmath441 using a linearly foliated torus  see lemma 3.17 in @xcite .",
    "* step 4 : * we now show that if @xmath370 , then @xmath371 destabilizes . to see this",
    ", note that since @xmath377 , if @xmath371 has @xmath370 , we know that @xmath371 is a legendrian ruling on the boundary of a solid torus @xmath222 and that @xmath222 either contains a solid torus with @xmath444 or can be thickened to a solid torus with such a boundary slope , since @xmath408 .",
    "thus @xmath371 will destabilize by the imbalance principle .",
    "* step 5 : * we now show that if @xmath445 is in a valley of the legendrian mountain range , that is @xmath446 have images in the mountain range , but @xmath447 does not , then there are two legendrian representatives of @xmath69 at @xmath8 , namely the two closest peaks @xmath448 and @xmath449 , such that @xmath450 for some @xmath451 .    to see this , first note that from the distribution of rotation numbers at @xmath8 , there are two types of valleys , those with depth @xmath360 , and those with depth @xmath452 .",
