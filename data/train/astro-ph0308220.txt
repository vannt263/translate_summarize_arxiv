    "sn 1987a was detected with the rntgen satellite ( _ rosat _ ) as an unresolved source and the observed x - ray flux was linearly increasing ( hasinger et al .",
    "the high angular resolution images from the _ chandra _ observations have revealed a shell - like structure of the x - ray remnant ( burrows et al . 2000 ) .",
    "monitoring observations with _",
    "chandra _ have shown a continuous development of the x - ray bright spots , which are in general spatially coincident with the optical and radio spots ; a steady increase of the soft x - ray flux ; and evidence of the radial expansion of the snr ( park et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the thermal x - ray spectrum was fitted with an electron temperature of @xmath2 @xmath0 2.5 kev .",
    "the broadening of the atomic emission lines as detected with the dispersed spectrum indicated a shock velocity of @xmath03400 km s@xmath1 , which provided direct evidence for electron - ion non - equilibrium behind the shock front ( michael et al . , 2002 ) .",

    "as of may 2002 , we have performed a total of six monitoring observations of snr 1987a with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( table  1 ) .",
    "the description of the observations and the data reduction of the first four observations can be found in literature ( burrows et al . , 2000 ;",

    "( 2002 ) before further standard data screenings , the sub - pixel resolution method ( tsunemi et al . , 2001 ) was applied , and then the image was deconvolved ( burrows et al . , 2000 ; park et al . , 2002 and the references therein ) to achieve the best - utilizable angular resolution .    .",

    "now , we detect newly developing x - ray spots .",
    "the soft x - ray spots are consistent with the optical spots while the hard x - ray spots are coincident with the radio lobes",
    ". these characteristics of the x - ray spots support the interpretation that the soft spots are the x - ray emission from the slow shock encountering dense protrusions of the inner ring and that the hard spots are emission from a fast forward shock propagating through the hii region .",
    "the emergence of new x - ray spots in the western side in addition to the eastern side indicates that the x - ray emission from snr 1987a will be a _",
    "complete _ ring in near future .",
    "with two new acis observations , we confirm the previously reported radial expansion rate of the x - ray snr .",
    "the spectrum is fitted with a plane - parallel shock model with @xmath2 @xmath0 2.5 kev and low abundances , which is consistent with the previous results indicating x - ray emission primarily from the shocked csm .",
    "the latest observation suggests a differential evolution of the volume emission measure between the east and the west , which might be an indication of complex density structure of the csm along the inner ring .",
    "the current data are however insufficient to make a firm conclusion and follow - up observations should be helpful to understand this feature .",
