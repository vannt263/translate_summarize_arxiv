    "entanglement is a quantum phenomenon in which states ( represented by density operators ) of a composite system composed of several quantum subsystems can not be written as a convex combination of tensor products of the states of the subsystems .",
    "such entangled states have , in recent decades , been of much interest as a resource for quantum information applications , such as for quantum communication @xcite . in particular ,",
    "einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr)-like entanglement , generated in the continuous variables such as the amplitude and phase quadratures of a gaussian optical field , has evoked considerable interest over discrete - variable entanglement , such as entanglement in finite - level systems like qubits , because epr entangled pairs can be prepared easily and rapidly in quantum optics . in this paper , we are interested in epr entanglement between two propagating continuous - mode gaussian fields .",
    "such a kind of entanglement is more accessible compared to epr entanglement between a pair of single - mode fields produced in , say , inside an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "epr entanglement between continuous - mode gaussian fields can be realized by two - mode squeezed states produced as the output of a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) . by pumping a strong coherent beam ( which can be regarded as an undepleted classical light ) to a crystal inside the cavity of the nopa , two vacuum modes of the cavity",
    "interact with the pump beam , and photons escaping the cavity through its partially transmissive mirrors generate two output beams that are squeezed in amplitude and phase quadratures .",
    "if the two outgoing fields are squeezed below the quantum shot - noise limit , they are considered as epr entangled beams @xcite .",
    "the input / output block representation of a nopa ( @xmath0 ) is shown as fig .",

    "the nopa has four ingoing fields and four outgoing fields . among the inputs , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are amplification losses , caused by unwanted vacuum modes coupled into the cavity . as the two outputs corresponding to the loss fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not of interest in this work",

    "it was shown that this scheme can produce better epr entanglement between the propagating gaussian fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( in the sense of producing more two - mode squeezing between quadratures of the fields ) for the same amount of total pump power used in the two nopas , and displays more tolerance to transmission losses in the system , as compared to a conventional single nopa and a cascaded two - nopa system .        in a subsequent work @xcite",

    "in addition , unlike the work in @xcite , the system is considered ideally static , that is , we consider the limit where the nopas are approximated as static devices with an infinite bandwidth @xcite .",
    "the merits of studying this infinite bandwidth limit are twofold : ( i ) it allows a simplified analysis of the system , and ( ii ) calculations in the infinite bandwidth setting gives a very good approximation to the epr entanglement in the low frequency region , discussed further in section  [ sec : nopa ] . in this infinite bandwidth setting , we show explicitly that the choice of the scattering matrix in the scheme of @xcite is in a certain sense locally optimal with respect to all possible choices of scattering matrices @xmath6 in the coherent feedback configuration of fig .",

    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to prove a local optimality property of a recently proposed coherent feedback configuration for distributed generation of epr entanglement using two nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers ( nopas ) in the idealized infinite bandwidth limit . </S>",
    "<S> this local optimality is with respect to a class of similar coherent feedback configurations but employing different unitary scattering matrices , representing different scattering of propagating signals within the network . </S>",
    "<S> the infinite bandwidth limit is considered as it significantly simplifies the analysis , allowing local optimality criteria to be explicitly verified . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , this limit is relevant for the finite bandwidth scenario as it provides an accurate approximation to the epr entanglement in the low frequency region where epr entanglement exists . </S>"
