    "within such a framework important physical quantities such as the electron self - energy or the charge and spin susceptibilities can be calculated exploiting the special symmetries of the model.@xcite    finite doping away from half - filling qualitatively changes the above description , since it breaks electron - hole symmetry and also the pseudo lorentz invariance needed for the equivalence with qed in two space dimensions .",

    "( [ eq : osc ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , our numerical calculations show that for large distances the induced density does not change sign even in the hypothetical case of @xmath97 where the ratio between oscillatory and tf contribution would be maximal .",

    "[ fig : friedel ] for the particular case of @xmath98 : the induced density @xmath85 does not change sign , but oscillates around a finite offset .    the polarization also determines the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction energy between two magnetic impurities as well as the induced spin density due to a magnetic impurity , both quantities being proportional to the fourier transform of @xmath99.@xcite for a magnetic impurity at @xmath100 the induced spin density @xmath101 is @xmath102note that the magnetic response is proportional to the bare polarization , since the spin - spin interaction is mediated via the short ranged exchange interaction ( in contrast to the long ranged coulomb interaction in the case of charge response ) . that is why the tf contribution is missing and the induced spin density oscillates around zero .",

    "we have found that , although the charge density does show oscillations around an average value , it does it without changing sign .",
    "the reason for this remarkable behavior is that friedel oscillations superpose on the dominant thomas - fermi induced density , with both contributions decaying at long distances @xmath165 with the same power law @xmath93 .",
    "the dynamical polarization has been used to calculate the dispersion relation and the decay rate of plasmons and acoustic phonons .",
    "like in the 2deg case , the plasmon frequency shows a @xmath121-behavior in the long wavelength regime .",
    "we have determined the region in the @xmath166 plane where the plasmon is stable , as well as the decay rate in the regime where it is not .",
    "the dispersion of acoustical phonons has been shown to be strongly dependent on the chemical potential .",
    "in particular , we have found that the sound velocity approaches the fermi velocity at low doping .",
    "however , the same limit shows an increase in the decay rate of acoustic phonons due to electron - hole pair excitation .",

    "<S> the polarization of graphene is calculated exactly within the random phase approximation for arbitrary frequency , wave vector , and doping . at finite doping , </S>",
    "<S> the static susceptibility saturates to a constant value for low momenta . at @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> it has a discontinuity only in the second derivative . in the presence of a charged impurity </S>",
    "<S> this results in friedel oscillations which decay with the same power law as the thomas fermi contribution , the latter being always dominant . </S>",
    "<S> the spin density oscillations in the presence of a magnetic impurity are also calculated . the dynamical polarization for low @xmath1 and arbitrary @xmath2 is employed to calculate the dispersion relation and the decay rate of plasmons and acoustic phonons as a function of doping . </S>",
    "<S> the low screening of graphene , combined with the absence of a gap , leads to a significant stiffening of the longitudinal acoustic lattice vibrations . </S>"
