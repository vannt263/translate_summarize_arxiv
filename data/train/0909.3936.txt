    "hickson compact groups of galaxies ( hcgs ) are collections of three to seven galaxies inside a three magnitude interval , where the members have a projected separation of the order of the galaxy diameters and a low velocity dispersion ( @xmath0200 km.s@xmath1 , hickson 1992 ) .",
    "these galaxies , located in the denser environments of the local universe , experience a high rate of galaxy - galaxy interactions and merging .",
    "they constitute a privileged laboratory to study different stages of interactions from violent merging to systems with no apparent signs of interaction .",
    "@xcite analyzed rotation curves for 32 hickson compact group galaxies and found that two - thirds of them had peculiar rotation curves .",
    "for the sub - sample of galaxies for which rotation curves could be derived , they found that spiral galaxies in compact groups have low mass - to - light ratios compared to field galaxies by about 30% , which could be explained if compact group galaxies have smaller dark halos than their field counterparts .",
    "given that compact groups are environments where tidal encounters are common , it may be expected that interactions have stripped or disrupted the galaxy dark halos at some level .",
    "these conclusions have important consequences for the determination of group lifetimes and understanding how compact groups evolve and eventually merge .",
    "in order to address these questions , we have launched an observational program to obtain and analyze 2d velocity fields of hcgs using scanning fabry - perot techniques .",
    "fabry - perot imaging of about 30 groups ( about 100 galaxies ) have be obtained to date .",
    "specific groups have been studied such as hcg  16 @xcite , hcg  92 @xcite , hcg  31@xcite , hcg  90 @xcite , hcg  18 @xcite and hcg  79 @xcite .",
    "hcg  07 , hcg  10 , hcg  19 , hcg  87 , hcg  91 and hcg  96 have been studied by @xcite and @xcite studied hcg  88 , hcg  89 , hcg  100 .",
    "@xcite studied the kinematics and the star formation in the intragroup medium in hcg  02 , hcg  22 and hcg  23 .",
    "a determination of a group evolutionary sequence was done by @xcite and the study of the tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation of the galaxies in these dense environments was done by @xcite .",
    "they have shown , for a sample of 25 rotation curves of late - type galaxies , that hcg galaxies follow the ( t - f ) relation but a few galaxies are brighter than expected from the relation with their mass or , alternatively , present a mass that is too low for their luminosities .",
    "@xcite favor a scenario in which these outliers have been brightened because of either enhanced star formation or merging .",
    "alternatively , the cg galaxies may have undergone truncation of their dark halo due to interactions .",
    "the fact that the b - band t - f relation is similar for compact group and field galaxies tells us that these galaxies show common mass - to - size relations and that the halos of compact group galaxies have not been significantly stripped inside r@xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of the mass distribution ( luminous and dark ) of spiral galaxies in compact groups in order to determine whether galaxies in dense environments have experienced a different history than galaxies in less dense environments .",
    "this work extends the study by @xcite on the dynamics of galaxies in compact groups by investigating the distribution of the mass , taking into account the contribution of the bulge , the disk and the dark halo .",
    "to quantity the mass distribution of galaxies we have used mass models based on h@xmath3 rotation curves and surface brightness profiles .",
    "we could not derive extended rotation curves , with combined h@xmath3 and hi data , as done by @xcite ( hereafter s08 ) for galaxies in looser environments , given that there are no hi rotation curves available for the compact group galaxies in our sample .",
    "different profiles have been tested to model dark halos .",
    "the mass - to - light fraction of the disk is computed together with the dark halo parameters using the best fit model ( hereafter bfm ) and the maximum disk model ( hereafter mdm ) .",
    "the mdm approach uses the exponential disk in order to fit the rotation curve . with the mdm approch",
    "we use the iso hypothesis to model the halo .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the data and models ( photometric and kinematic ) . in section 3 , we review the mass distribution of galaxies in the field and in clusters . in section 4",
    "we present , analyze and discuss our results on hcgs and compare them to results in less dense environments .",
    "finally in section 5 , some concluding remarks are given . in appendix ( a )",
    "we describe individually the rcs for each galaxy and in appendix ( b ) , from figure [ figure04 ] to figure [ figure21 ] , we present the j - band surface brightness profile and the rcs for the galaxies studies .",
    "we have used the 2mass survey @xcite to compute the photometric surface brightness profiles .",
    "images from the 2mass survey are already calibrated with a given zero point for each field and with a pixel size of 1   on the sky .",
    "this pixel size is well matched to the pixel size of the fabry - perot maps of 0.91   @xcite .",
    "we have built surface brightness profiles using the j - band because it probes the dominant stellar component out to the outskirts .",
    "we have selected a sub - sample of 18 galaxies among the 25 galaxies used in the @xcite study . indeed , 2mass data are not exploitable for seven of them : four galaxies ( hcg19c , hcg79d , hcg89d , hcg96d ) show j - images that are too weak to be exploited and three others ( hcg100c , hcg100d , hcg96a ) prove to be too difficult to derive satisfactory surface brightness profiles .",
    "surface brightness profiles have been built by fitting ellipses to the isophotes of the j - band images using the _ ellipse task _ of the _ sdsdas package _ with iraf .",
    "we only fixed the center of the ellipse in the fitting parameters and we usually used a 0.2   space between two ellipses . in a few cases ( for hcg07c , hcg16c , hcg19a , hcg88d ) , we had to extrapolate the outer profile using an exponential disk profile in order to reach the same extension as the rotation curves since the sky background contaminates the surface brightness profile .    in order to use the mass model ,",
    "we have performed a decomposition of the surface brightness profile into classical two components : an exponential disk @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the central surface brightness and @xmath6 is the disk scale parameter ,    and a bulge with an r@xmath7 law @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the central surface brightness , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scale factors .    to perform the decomposition we used a home - made program based on a minimized @xmath12 routine from the minuit package @xcite .",
    "the program first fits the disk using a visual estimate of the profile .",
    "it then subtracts the fitted disk and adjusts the bulge .",
    "the operation is repeated in order to minimize the @xmath12 for each disk and bulge parameter . using this method ,",
    "the structures seen in the disk surface brightness profiles are carried on to the mass profiles .",
    "we then have five parameters , two for the disk ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and three for the bulge ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the results of the fit .",
    "we also list the values of inclination used to derive the rotation curves , from velocity fields , published in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in order to compute the mass distribution ,",
    "we have combined the stellar light contribution derived from the photometry with the dark halo contribution from the rotation curves using the model developed by @xcite and revised by @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profile is transformed into a mass distribution for the stellar disk and the stellar bulge assuming a variable but radially constant mass - to - light ratio m / l @xcite .",
    "mass decompositions into luminous and dark components are not unique , mainly due to the uncertainties of the stellar disk m / l @xcite but also due to our ignorance of the actual dark halo density profile .",
    "we minimized this problem by using j - band photometry in order to narrow down the stellar component to the old stellar populations .",
    "this mass model estimates the contribution of each velocity component ( bulge , disk and halo ) using the photometric profile decomposition for the luminous contribution ( bulge and disk ) and a predetermined density profile for the halo .    the luminosity profile , in the j - band ,",
    "is used to probe the mass - dominant stellar component and this is transformed into a mass distribution for the stellar disk assuming a variable but radially constant m / l ratio for the disk and the bulge . for this study we used two different density distributions to represent the dark halo .",
    "first we used a spherical distribution given by an isothermal sphere with a density profile given by :    @xmath13^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the central halo density and @xmath15 the core radius .",
    "we also used the navarro , frenk and white @xcite ( hereafter nfw ) density profile :    @xmath16    the result of the quadratic sum of each velocity component ( bulge , disk and halo ) is fitted to the observational rotation curve by minimizing the reduced is the @xmath17 divided by the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "] @xmath12 in the four dimensions space : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath15 .",
    "the reduced @xmath17 can be affected by small and large scale variations in the measured velocities that can have various origins ( bars , other non - aximmetric motions , star formation , projection effects , etc ) that the models does not take into account .",
    "a high @xmath17 does not therefore necessarily means a bad fit .",
    "a reduced @xmath17 around 1 is an indication of a good fit , but because of the degeneracies between parameters the result may not be unique .",
    "we looked if errors listed in table 1 and 2 for the halo and m / l parameters are correlated with the reduced @xmath17 .",
    "it appears that the reduced @xmath17 remains more or less constant with the errors , showing no correlations . in appendix ( a )",
    "we give comments on each galaxy analysis . in appendix",
    "( b ) ( from figure [ figure04 ] to figure [ figure21 ] ) we present the fits to the j - band surface brightness profiles and the rotation curves using the isothermal sphere to model the dark halo .",
    "the velocity uncertainties , presented on the plots , are the differences between the two sides of the rotation curve ( receeding and approaching ) . in appendix (",
    "a ) we also give a description of the fit for both the nfw and maximum disk hypothesis for the dark halo , but the corresponding plots are not presented in the paper .",
    "the main goal of this work is to compare the mass distributions for galaxies in dense environments with the ones found in less dense or isolated environments .",
    "two different works can be found in the literature to which we could compare our results : @xcite ( hereafter b04 ) studies on galaxies in clusters and @xcite ( hereafter s08 ) studied field galaxies .",
    "b04 shows rotation curves for 40 spiral galaxies from the @xcite survey , observed with a fp interferometer .",
    "b04 followed a similar technique to ours using both the photometry ( in the i - band ) and the rcs in order to fit the halo parameters and determine the mass distribution .",
    "the photometric profiles used by b04 come from @xcite .",
    "two dark halo models were used by b04 , same as those used by us , a pseudo - isothermal and the nfw density profile .",
    "the sample from @xcite is not very homogenous with respect to galaxy environment .",
    "more than half the galaxies present comes from clusters . in order to compare our results with cluster galaxies , we had to convert the nfw dark halo parameters they used into our set of parameters .",
    "we deduced the central density ( @xmath14 ) and the core radius ( @xmath15 ) from the @xmath21 and @xmath22 from b04 using definitions found in nfw .",
    "the parameters for the iso - thermal halo are the same as ours .",
    "b04 found that stars - only model fits most of the rcs of their sample over a significant radial range .",
    "but the addition of a dark halo generally leads to low values of m / ls .",
    "they also confirm a scaling law between the central halo density and the core radius .",
    "@xcite used i - band photometry and the @xmath23 indicated in b04 were determined in the same band . in order to compare the results from our sample with the cluster galaxies , it was necessary to transform our surface brightness profile from the j - band to the i - band .",
    "we first made the hypothesis that the profile in the j - band has the same shape and slope as in the i - band ( same scale length for the exponential disk and same r@xmath24 for the bulge ) .",
    "only the @xmath25 and @xmath26 were modified .",
    "we used the apparent magnitude found in ned in the sdss i - band for our galaxies and determined the absolute magnitude in the johnson i - band using @xcite formula and the distances noted in the rc3 @xcite .",
    "we scaled the surface brightness profile of our galaxies in order to get the calculated i - band absolute magnitude using our mass model program .",
    "hereafter we perform the comparison with all the cluster galaxies sample from b04 and our hcg galaxies and we discuss the results in the conclusion but we did not plot it in the paper .",
    "we also wanted to compare with the field galaxies from the ghasp survey ( galaxies halpha survey project , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) where late - type field galaxies have been observed using a fabry - perot interferometer . s08",
    "present the mass model for a sub - sample of 36 galaxies of the ghasp survey . for this survey , we had to convert our j - band surface brightness profiles into r - band . for hcg 16a , hcg 88a , hcg 88c , hcg 89a and hcg 89c",
    ", we directly used the surface brightness profiles from @xcite and for hcg 96c we used the profile from @xcite .",
    "we estimated a mean shift between @xmath25 in the j - band and @xmath25 in the r - band for the remaining galaxies and we verified that the @xmath27 magnitudes obtained with the mass model program were consistent with what we found in the litterature @xcite .",
    "s08 confirm the halo scaling laws showing that low luminosity galaxies have small core radius and high central halo density and that the halo surface density is constant with the absolute magnitude .",
    "they also found that a trend can be seen between the core radius and the color or the disk scale length .",
    "the galaxies from the cluster galaxies sample have absolute b magnitudes between : @xmath28 and the field galaxies b magnitudes are between @xmath29",
    ". our sample of hcg have @xmath30 .",
    "we performed a ks test between our sample and the cluster galaxies sample plus a sub - sample of the field galaxies with an @xmath31 representing 16 galaxies .",
    "the results show they are similar at the 85% level or higher .",
    "we then used this sub - sample of the field galaxies sample with @xmath31 to perform the comparison .",
    "in this section we discuss the relationships between halo parameters , disk m / l ratios , halo and disk masses using the different halo models and also comparing with other galaxies samples ( figures [ figure01 ] to [ figure03 ] ) .    in order to point out differences in the halo shape parameters between galaxies in different environment , we compared the two samples , cluster and field galaxies , using both the iso and the nfw dark halo profiles .",
    "thus we analyse the disk m / l and the halo mass fraction as a function of the b absolute magnitude ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) and we compare the halo mass fraction and the disk",
    "m / l using a iso or a nfw halo ( see figure [ figure03 ] ) .",
    "we only compare with field galaxies and we derived the m / l within the r - band . for the halo central density and the core radius , we estimated the errors of the fit by taking the 1@xmath32 error of the @xmath12 minimization .",
    "we plot the maximum error bars determined for different figures in order not to overfill the plots .",
    "finally we show differences between the central halo density and core radius using iso and nfw halo models and we compare the @xmath17 for those two halo models ( figure [ figure03 ] ) .      in order to make a fair comparison of the halo parameters , we evaluated these parameters using the r and i photometry for the hcg galaxies .",
    "coefficients of the linear regression are quite similar and differences are inside the error bars of the linear fit .",
    "for this reason we present in figure [ figure01 ] , the halo parameters derived using the j - band photometry .",
    "figures [ figure01]a , b show the tight correlation between the central halo density @xmath14 and the core radius @xmath15 using the iso and nfw models for galaxies in three different environments . figure [ figure01]a shows the strong correlation between the central density and the core radius for all samples using the iso model . table 3 summarises coefficients of the linear regression with the correspondent correlation coefficients .",
    "these fits were obtained excluding 5 galaxies from the cluster galaxies sample because they were several orders of magnitude out of range . for the cluster galaxies sample ,",
    "5 galaxies show highly peaked halos in comparison with the other galaxies .",
    "cluster galaxies galaxies show that part of the sample has lower core radii , when compared to hcg and field galaxies .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that b04 uses a pseudo - isothermal halo density profile instead a strict isothermal model . with the mdm model ( not shown on the plot ) ,",
    "the relation is also very well defined with a correlation of :    @xmath34 ( see table 3 ) .",
    "figure [ figure01]b shows the same correlation as before but using nfw model .",
    "it is clear that the relation between the central halo density and the core radius is much scattered using the nfw than the iso model .",
    "the correlation found using the nfw model is @xmath35 for the hcg galaxies and the central density of the regression is lower than the iso model .",
    "the correlation between the central halo density and the core radius is very strong for the three samples using iso or nfw models .",
    "the correlation coefficient is almost the same for the cluster galaxies sample using either the iso or the nfw models and quite different for the field and hcg samples using these two models .      instead of plotting the disk scale length versus halo core radius as s08 and @xcite",
    ", we present the disk scale length normalised to the halo core radius vs the absolute magnitude . the result is presented in figure [ figure01]c .",
    "we used the all field galaxies sample in order to display the less luminous galaxies . for the field galaxies",
    "it is clear that the ratio is constant , showing that the core radius and the disk scale length are connected somehow and that it is independent from galaxy luminosity .",
    "the result for the three samples is consistent .",
    "we perform the plot using the iso model only , but the result is almost the same if we use nfw . from @xcite and @xcite we know that the disk scale length is proportional to the galaxy luminosity for a large variety of galaxy types .",
    "this relation is also found for field and hcg galaxies .",
    "we verified that the core radius increases with the galaxy luminosity .      in figure [ figure01]d",
    ", we present the halo central surface density ( @xmath38 ) versus the b absolute magnitude for the three samples using the isothermal sphere .",
    "hcg galaxies from our sample are brighter than the field galaxies , but the halo surface density is almost the same between the three samples using the iso model .",
    "s08 found , from the central halo density and the core radius as a function of the absolute magnitude , that faint galaxies show a more concentrated dark halo than massive late type galaxies .",
    "s08 confirmed the results of @xcite , with a slightly higher constant halo density .",
    "however , with the cluster galaxies sample and our hcg galaxies , it is difficult to confirm this trend because of the lack of faint galaxies in both samples .",
    "the results using nfw model are very similar to what can be observed with iso .",
    "@xcite have investigated the evolution of galactic dark matter haloes through collisionless high resolution n - body simulations .",
    "they found that haloes evolve through a series of quiescient phases , well fitted by a nfw profile .",
    "they showed that the characteristic density @xmath39 and the radius @xmath40 are strongly correlated .      in this section , we discuss the fitted disk m / l parameter using the iso , the nfw models ( see figure [ figure02]a and [ figure03]a ) . the dependence of disk",
    "m / l on the absolute magnitude for both samples ( field and hcg galaxies ) is analysed in figure [ figure02]a using only the iso model .",
    "more than half the hcg galaxies show a very low disk mass - to - light ratio ( inferior to one ) .",
    "if we limit the field galaxies sample to galaxies with similar magnitudes ( @xmath31 ) , we found that slightly less than half field galaxies have disk m / l larger than 4.0 when the maximum m / l for hcg galaxies is 3.9 .",
    "_ hcg galaxies have a lower m / l disk ratio than isolated galaxies in the same range of absolute blue magnitude .",
    "_ this may be due to galaxies in hickson groups having luminosities boosted by star formation triggered by interactions or their maximum velocities diminished by tidal stripping .",
    "the disk mass - to - light ratio between iso and nfw halo models for both the hcg galaxies and the field galaxies of ghasp are analysed in figure [ figure03]a .",
    "we first can notice that m / l values for the hcg galaxies are spread over a large range .",
    "this situation is clearer for field galaxies .",
    "almost all galaxies show a greater m / l using the iso model .",
    "( a ) with hcg 87a , the nfw model ca nt fit the rotation curve with a minimum of halo and a little disk , while iso puts the disk to almost zero and extend the dark halo .",
    "( b ) for hcg 91c , nfw puts the bulge to zero and gives a larger disk than iso .",
    "the result is that the central part is better fitted with iso and the outer part of the rotation curve is better using nfw and the @xmath17 is very similar for both .",
    "( c ) the situation is similar with hcg 007c because of a bump that neither model can fit .",
    "the fact that nfw gives lower m / l disk ratios is consistent with what b04 found for their sample . in their case ,",
    "the photometry was done in i - band , but it does not change significantly the trend .",
    "we also compared the disk m / l for hcg between iso and the maximum disk model ( not shown here ) .",
    "the agreement is high even if mdm has , by definition , a natural tendency to give an higher disk m / l .",
    "this means that the bfm gives a solution that is very close to mdm and thus mdm appears to be the favourite solution .    in conclusion , using the iso model instead of the nfw model results in a greater disk m / l and that , at least for hcg galaxies",
    ", the disk mass is independent of the galaxy luminosity .",
    "this section presents relations between halo and disk masse as a function of absolute magnitude for two different models : iso and nfw .",
    "table 4 presents the disk mass , halo mass and halo mass fraction using the different models iso , nfw and mdm . in the determination of the total mass ,",
    "the hi mass was not taken into account .",
    "figure [ figure02]b shows the halo mass fraction versus the absolute magnitude for both hcg and field galaxies .",
    "the plot shows that only three hcg galaxies , hcg 10d , hcg 96c and hcg 88a , have a halo mass fraction lower than 0.8 within the range of absolute b magnitude and 66% of field galaxies have halo mass fraction larger than 0.8 for a larger range of b magnitude .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the disk is predominent .",
    "the others galaxies ( hcg and isolated galaxies ) are totally dominated by the dark halo and the dark halo is not related to the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we were interested in a possible relation between @xmath41 and the disk mass for hcg and field galaxies .",
    "figure [ figure02]c shows a clear correlation between the disk @xmath42 and the disk mass for both hcg and field galaxies . as for all figures in that section",
    ", we have plot the all sample of field galaxies , if we restrict the field galaxies sample to those with an absolute b magnitude inferior to -18.5 , we noticied that hcg galaxies and field galaxies follow the same relation .",
    "this is confirmed with a work by @xcite that analyse disk masses for 18 spirals by both modelling their rotation curve and by fitting spectral energy distributions .",
    "the authors found a good agreement between the two methods .",
    "beside their discussion about the best way to calculate the disk mass , they present the relationship between the stellar mass , the color and the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "they found that the m / l is increasing with the disk mass .",
    "based on a technique of mass decomposition of spiral galaxies from disk kinematics @xcite , found that the ratio of the disk mass to halo mass fraction shows a strong dependency with respect to the luminosity .",
    "their study points out a higher disk mass compared to our sample or field galaxies .",
    "figure [ figure03]b compares the relation between the ratios halo mass fraction / total mass estimated with iso and nfw models for both hcg and field galaxies .",
    "a ks test between the two halo mass fractions from field and compact group galaxies for the same range of absolute b magnitude , proved that both samples have 90% chance to be drawn from the parent distribution , indicating that there is no statistical difference between the two four galaxies ( hcg 007c , hcg 10d , hcg 87c and hcg 91c ) show lower halo masses using the nfw profile .",
    "the halo is much more important for hcg 007c using the iso model with respect to nfw , but both fit shows a poor @xmath17 .",
    "even if hcg 87c does not show a disturbed rc , nfw halo model provides a poor fit .",
    "no fit is possible to mimic the rotation curve with a nfw halo model . for hcg 91c ,",
    "both models lead to almost the same amount of disk , but nfw uses 10 times less halo than iso for almost the same @xmath17 .    in conclusion , for both field and hcg galaxies , the mass is dominated by the halo , as b04 showed , and no differences are found between galaxies in the field and galaxies in dense environment with respect to disk mass .",
    "we have compared the halo parameters ( core radius and central density ) for both models ( nfw and iso ) for both hcg and field galaxies . figures [ figure03]c , d show that the central halo density with iso is higher than nfw and , in the mean time , the halo core radius is smaller with iso than with nfw .",
    "the isothermal model gives apparently a more concentrated dark halo shape than the nwf96 model .",
    "this seems in contradiction with the `` natural '' cuspy shape of nfw dark halo profile .",
    "indeed iso profile is shallow in the center while nfw is more peaked .",
    "( see @xcite for the comparison between the two halo profiles ) .",
    "the different parameters of the halo @xmath14 and @xmath15 are derived together with the m / l of the disk using the best fit model on the rcs .",
    "since the slope of the rc is not high enough to be fitted by the cuspy nfw profile , it favours the disk and thus underestimates the halo .",
    "this is not the case with the core - like iso model which matches the relatively faint slope of the rc and thus minimizes the disk and favours the halo .",
    "figure [ figure03]e compares the quality of the fits using a @xmath17 parameter between the isothermal sphere and the nfw models for both hcg and field galaxies . to display the result ,",
    "we have limited the @xmath12 range between 0 and 15 .",
    "two galaxies ( hcg 19a and hcg 91a ) show a high @xmath17 ( @xmath43 ) with both models .",
    "two galaxies ( hcg 087c and hcg 88d ) show a very poor @xmath17 with the nfw model only .",
    "three other galaxies ( hcg 16c , hcg 19b and hcg 89c ) show a higher @xmath17 for the nfw than for the isothermal sphere .",
    "s08 noted that nfw gives higher @xmath17 than the iso model .",
    "figure [ figure03]e confirms this for hcg galaxies .",
    "we can conclude that , as for field galaxies , hcg iso dark halo fits the rc better than the nfw model .",
    "based on a sample of @xmath44 100 velocity fields of spiral galaxies belonging to 25 hcgs , our previous study has demonstrated that : 40% ( 38 galaxies ) of the hcg galaxies analysed in our sample do not allow the computation of the rc .",
    "this is because these galaxies are strongly perturbed by interaction and mergers .",
    "33% ( 31 galaxies ) of hcg galaxies are regular enough to calculate a rc but the rc is not symmetric to allow the derivation of a mass model . these perturbed galaxies are mildly interacting .",
    "the remaining 27% ( 25 galaxies ) of them are suitable to derive mass models . for a variety reasons",
    "only 18 galaxies have been studied in the present work .",
    "the rcs have been combined with 2mass j - band surface brightness profiles to derive their mass models .",
    "two shapes of dark halos have been considered : a core - like density profile ( isothermal sphere or iso ) and a cuspy - like one ( nfw ) .",
    "best fit models and maximum disk models have been computed for the two dark halo profiles .",
    "we have compared the hcg galaxies with two samples of galaxies in different environments : field and clusters galaxies .",
    "the three samples ( hcg , isolated and cluster ) have been analysed using the same tools .",

    "the linear regression constant found by @xcite is different in comparison with those found with the three samples .",
