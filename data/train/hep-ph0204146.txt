    "photon production is considered to be a very interesting signal of the formation of a quark gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions @xcite . indeed , because of their very weak coupling to matter , photons ( and more generally any electromagnetic probe ) have a large mean free path which enables them to escape without reinteractions from a medium the size of which is at best a few tens of fermis .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the calculation of the photon and dilepton rate is performed under the hypothesis of local equilibrium , i.e. one calculates a rate ( number of photons produced per unit time and per unit volume ) using thermal field theory in equilibrium , and then plugs this rate into some hydrodynamical model @xcite which describes the system by dividing it in cells where a local equilibrium is assumed and by assigning a local temperature and fluid 4-velocity to each cell .",
    "such a description is consistent as long as the photon formation time is small compared to the typical size of the cells in which an approximate equilibrium is realized @xcite .",
    "thermal field theory calculations of photon and dilepton production rates have been performed a long time ago @xcite , and have been reassessed under the new light shaded by the concept of hard thermal loops ( htl - @xcite ) @xcite . in this context , it has been found that some @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes which appear only in 2-loop diagrams @xcite ( like bremsstrahlung , as well as the process @xmath2 which can be deduced from bremsstrahlung by crossing symmetry - see figures [ fig : diagrams ] and [ fig : processes ] ) are also important .",
    "these processes are in fact enhanced by a strong sensitivity to the forward emission of the photon , due to a collinear singularity regularized by a thermal mass of order @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gauge coupling . in particular , the process on the left of figure [ fig : processes ] has been found to enhance considerably the rate of hard photons @xcite .",
    "this collinear enhancement mechanism has also been shown to play a role in multi - loop diagrams belonging to the class of ladder corrections and self - energy - corrections @xcite , and a resummation of this family of diagrams has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the effect of this resummation , also known as landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , leads to a small reduction ( by about 25% for photons in the range interesting for phenomenology ) of the photon rate .",
    "however , the strength of the lpm suppression decreases as one increases the invariant mass of the photon since the photon mass helps to regularize the collinear singularities .",
    "it is therefore expected that the dilepton rate can be accounted for by limiting oneself to a 2-loop calculation , and that the production of hard dileptons of intermediate invariant mass is dominated by the process shown on the left of figure [ fig : processes ] . under this assumption",
    ", the calculation of @xcite has been extended recently to the case where the photon mass can not be neglected any longer , with emphasis on the `` off - shell annihilation '' process that was already dominant for hard photons @xcite . in this paper , we found a simple generalization to the case of massive photons of the formula known for the imaginary part of the real photon polarization tensor .",
    "this formula reads : @xmath5\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad\\times\\left\\{(p_0 ^ 2+r_0 ^ 2)(j_{_{t}}-j_{_{l}})+2{{q^2 p_0r_0+m_\\infty^2(p_0 ^ 2+r_0 ^ 2)}\\over{m_{\\rm eff}^2 } } ( k_{_{t}}-k_{_{l}})\\right\\}\\ , .",

    "those definitions are only appropriate for @xmath8 , because they have been obtained by rescaling the transverse momentum @xmath9 of the gluon by writing @xmath10 .",
    "however , it was argued in @xcite that the correct result for @xmath11 can be obtained as the real part of the analytic continuation of the result for @xmath8 .",
    "most of this paper deals with the case of a positive @xmath12 . ]",
    "@xmath13 where the @xmath14 are the transverse and longitudinal self - energies resummed on the gluon propagator , and where we denote @xmath15 with @xmath16 the thermal mass of a hard quark ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "therefore , in addition to the function @xmath23 already introduced in the case of quasi - real photons was forgotten in @xcite .",
    "it comes from the htl correction to the @xmath24 vertex .",
    "this vertex correction was also neglected in @xcite , without any damage to this approach since it affects only the component @xmath25 of the polarization tensor , while only the transverse components are calculated in these papers ( see @xcite for more details on this issue ) . ] , we need two new functions @xmath26 for the term proportional to the photon invariant mass squared @xmath27 . all are dimensionless functions of the ratio of @xmath28 to the plasmon mass @xmath29 which appears as a prefactor in the self - energies @xmath14 .",
    "up to now , the @xmath23 and @xmath26 have only been evaluated numerically ( @xcite , with a mistake corrected by @xcite ) , which is sufficient for the case of real photons since in this case they are fixed numbers that depend only on the number of colors and flavors but not on kinematical parameters ( @xmath30 ) . however , the cost of this procedure increases significantly in the case of virtual photons since the value of @xmath12 depends on the invariant mass @xmath31 , energy @xmath32 and quark energy @xmath33 .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to derive some analytical results regarding those functions .",
    "we first show how the integral over the variable @xmath34 can be performed exactly in the functions @xmath23 and @xmath26 by means of a simple sum - rule ( section [ sec : sum - rule ] ) .",

    "this is what enables us to relate the integral @xmath52 to the spectral representation of this propagator .",
    "indeed , it is known that the resummed propagator @xmath53 is related to its spectral function @xmath51 via the following spectral representation @xcite : @xmath54 taking the real part of this identity is by definition a real function .",

    "it may be useful to recall that , even if the derivation has been made having in mind a hard thermal loop for the self - energy @xmath84 , this result has a broader range of validity .",

    "the condition ( 2 ) is always true .",
    "conditions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) depend on the nature of the resummation under consideration , but are reasonable approximations in any system of well defined quasiparticles .    in @xcite , a formula for the photon rate based on sum rules was also presented . however , in this paper , the use of sum rules led only to a very complicated result ( involving explicitly the gluon dispersion equations as well as the residues of the gluon poles ) that was not useful for any practical purpose . by comparing the two methods , we can trace the simplification achieved in the present paper to a different choice for the integration variables .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the sum rules were applied to an integral over the variables @xmath19 , @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 is the momentum of the exchanged gluon ) , while in the present approach , we take as independent integration variables @xmath34 and @xmath89 .",
    "it appears that trading @xmath90 in favor of @xmath91 before using sum rules to perform the integral over @xmath34 leads to a dramatic simplification of the result , because some non trivial parts of the @xmath34 dependence get absorbed in the new variable @xmath91 .",
