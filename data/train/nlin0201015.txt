    "front propagation in fluid flows is relevant to many fields of sciences and technology ranging from marine ecology @xcite to chemistry @xcite and combustion technology @xcite .",
    "a complete description of the problem would require to consider the coupled evolution of reactants and velocity field , including the modification of the advecting field induced by the reaction . in general",
    ", this is a very difficult task @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simplified , but still physically significant , problem by neglecting the influence of the reactants on the velocity field .",
    "this amounts to consider the reaction as a constant - density process .",
    "aqueous auto - catalytic reactions , and gaseous combustion with a large flow intensity but sufficiently low values of gas expansion across the flame are important examples of chemical - physical systems for which this approximations is appropriate @xcite .    in the simplest model a scalar field , @xmath3 , which represents the fractional concentrations of the reaction s products (",
    "i.e. , @xmath4 indicates inert material , @xmath5 fresh one and @xmath6 means that fresh material coexists with products ) , evolves according to the advection - reaction - diffusion equation @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the molecular diffusivity , and @xmath9 is a given incompressible ( @xmath10 ) velocity field .",
    "@xmath11 is the production term and @xmath12 its time scale .",
    "two limiting cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) have been previously studied in detail : @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the former , the equation for a passive scalar",
    "is recovered ( for a review see ref .",
    "the latter corresponds to the reaction - diffusion equation , which has gathered much attention since the seminal works of fisher and kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskunov ( fkpp)@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) can be studied for different geometries and boundary conditions .",
    "for instance , one can consider an infinite strip in the horizontal direction with a reservoir of fresh material on the right and inert products on the left , and periodic boundary conditions along the transverse direction . with this geometry a front of inert material ( stable phase ) propagates from left to right .",
    "if the medium is at rest with the fkpp production term , @xmath15 , the front propagates with an asymptotic speed and thickness given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant depending on the definition adopted for @xmath18 .",
    "this result is valid whenever @xmath11 is a convex function ( @xmath19 ) with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for non - convex @xmath11 only upper and lower",
    "bounds for the front speed can be provided @xcite .",
    "a more interesting physical situation is when the velocity field is non zero . in this case , generally , the front propagates with an average limiting speed , @xmath22 , enhanced with respect to the fluid at rest ( @xmath23 ) . for very slow reaction , by means of homogenization techniques  @xcite , one can show that the front speed behaves as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfkpp ] ) with @xmath8 replaced by a renormalized diffusion coefficient , @xmath24 , the so - called eddy diffusivity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an exhaustive review on the determination of the eddy - diffusivity ) . in realistic systems , the reaction time scale is of the same order or ( more frequently ) faster than the velocity time scale ( fast reaction ) , so that a simple renormalization of @xmath8 is not sufficient to encompass the dynamical properties of the system  @xcite . in some cases",
    "the front speed can be still obtained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vfkpp ] ) renormalizing not only the diffusion constant , @xmath25 , but also the reaction time @xmath26 @xcite",
    ". however , a general method to compute @xmath22 for a generic velocity field does not exist .",
    "here we consider the limit of very fast reaction and very thin front , i.e. , the so - called geometrical optics regime @xcite .",
    "formally , this corresponds to the limit @xmath27 and @xmath28 maintaining the ratio @xmath29 constant @xcite : from ( [ eq : vfkpp ] ) this means that @xmath30 is finite and @xmath31 . in this regime",
    "the front is identified as a surface ( a line in @xmath32 ) , and the effect of the velocity field is to wrinkle the front increasing its area ( length in @xmath32 ) and thereby its speed  @xcite .    as to the velocity field we consider steady and unsteady cellular flows ( i.e. , with closed streamlines ) in two - dimensions @xcite .",
    "since coherent vortical structures are typically present in real hydrodynamical systems , cellular flows offer an idealized ( but non - trivial ) model to study the effects of this kind of structures on front propagation .",
    "real flows , e.g. , turbulent flows , are usually characterized by a very complex temporal dynamics and spatial development of scales . in this respect",
    "a steady cellular flow is too simple .",
    "therefore , we also consider either the presence of small scale spatial structures in the velocity field , or the effects of time dependence , which induces a complex temporal behavior for particle trajectories lagrangian chaos @xcite .",
    "we found that the front speed is mainly determined by the large scales velocity characteristics , i.e. , the effect of small scales is just to renormalize the largest scale velocity intensity .",
    "concerning time periodic cellular flows , we found that the front speed is not significantly modified with respect to the steady case , although rather subtle effects appear .",
    "namely the front speed locks on the flow frequency : a phenomenon which goes under the name of mode - locking ( or frequency - locking ) @xcite , and which has been already found in some models of front propagation @xcite .",
    "lagrangian chaos is suppressed by the reaction and only survives for a transient .",
    "however , asymptotically the spatial wrinkling ( `` complexity '' ) of the front is enhanced with respect to the steady case .",
    "we introduced a suitable observable to quantify the front complexity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss the geometrical optics limit .",
    "numerical results for steady cellular flows with one and more scales are presented in section  [ sec:3 ] , where we propose a simple model which well reproduces the numerical results .",
    "the effects of lagrangian chaos and velocity phase - locking in time dependent cellular flows are discussed in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "final remarks are reported in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the appendices are devoted to the numerical methods here employed and to a more detailed treatment of the frequency - locking phenomenon .",
    "from a physical point of view the geometrical optics limit ( in combustion jargon , the flamelet regime ) corresponds to situations in which the reaction time scale and reaction zone thickness are much faster and much smaller than the time and length scales of the flow , respectively ( e.g. , in turbulent flows this means that the front thickness is smaller than the kolmogorov length scale @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) @xcite .    being the front sharp , its dynamics can be described in terms of the evolution of the surface ( line in @xmath32 ) which divides the inert material ( @xmath4 ) from the fresh one ( @xmath5 ) . in this limit",
    "the problem can be formulated in terms of the evolution of a scalar field , @xmath35 , where the iso - line ( in 2d ) @xmath36 represents the front : @xmath37 is the inert material and @xmath38 is the fresh one .",
    "@xmath39 evolves according to the so - called @xmath39-equation @xcite @xmath40 the analytical treatment of this problem is not trivial , and even in relatively simple cases ( e.g. , shear flows ) numerical analysis is needed .",
    "recently majda and collaborators @xcite pointed out that there are situations in which the @xmath39-equation fails in reproducing the front speed of the original reaction - advection - diffusion model . indeed , in some systems the exact treatment of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rad ] ) in the limit @xmath27 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 does not lead to the same results of the @xmath39-equation .",
    "however , for the application we are interested in , the study of the @xmath39-equation is physically relevant @xcite .    in the absence of stirring ( @xmath43 )",
    "the front evolves according to the huygens principle , i.e. , a point @xmath44 belonging to the front surface moves with a velocity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the perpendicular direction to the front surface in @xmath44 . with open boundary conditions , at large times the front surface is asymptotically close to a sphere ( circle in @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , the preasymptotic behavior is mathematically non trivial @xcite and interesting in some technological problems .    in the presence of stirring ( @xmath47 )",
    "the problem is much more difficult .",
    "the first attempt to determine the front speed in such a regime dates back to the @xmath48 s with the work of damkler @xcite who suggested that , if the velocity field does not change the local ( bare ) front speed , @xmath30 , then the effective front speed is proportional to the total front area divided by the cross - section flow area . in two - dimensional geometry",
    "this means that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the transverse length , @xmath22 and @xmath51 are the average front speed and length respectively .",
    "the average velocity and length are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 indicates a time average .",
    "the instantaneous front velocity , @xmath55 , and length , @xmath56 , can be defined as follows .",
    "the velocity is given by @xcite @xmath57 in order to define the instantaneous front length , @xmath56 , we introduce the variable @xmath58 which assumes the value @xmath59 if @xmath60 is constant inside a circle of radius @xmath61 centered in @xmath62 , otherwise @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath63 only if the @xmath61-ball centered in @xmath62 contains a portion of the front ) .",
    "the front length is then defined by @xmath64",
    "we consider the following two - dimensional cellular flow , originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to mimic roll patterns in rayleigh - brnard convection , @xmath65 where @xmath1 is the flow intensity , @xmath50 the roll size ( in the following for simplicity , @xmath66 ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions are assumed . by fixing @xmath4 for @xmath67 and @xmath5 for @xmath68 the front propagates from left to right .",
    "it is natural to expect that the front speed can be expressed according to the following relation @xcite @xmath69 our aim is to investigate the dependence of @xmath22 on the flow intensity @xmath1 .",
    "= 8truecm = 6truecm    due to the spatial periodicity of the flow , after an initial transient , the front propagates periodically in time ( with period @xmath70 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] a typical time series of the instantaneous velocity @xmath55 is reported : peaks occur when the front length is maximal .",
    "the front speed can be defined as the average @xmath71 over a period .",
    "since the interface is sharp , we can easily track the farther edge of the interface ( @xmath72 ) , i.e. , the rightmost point ( in the @xmath73-direction ) for which @xmath74 .",
    "thus we can define a velocity @xmath75 which , since the front dynamics is periodic , is equivalent to the standard definition ( [ eq : vel ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : due ] we show some snapshots of the front at different times .",
    "it is possible to see cusps and pockets of unburnt material ( white ) left behind the front edge , as firstly noticed by ashurst and sivanshinsky @xcite . at high field intensity",
    "a trail of pockets is formed .",
    "we now revert to the behavior of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath1 . as far as we know , apart from very simple shear flows ( for which @xmath76 ) @xcite , there are no general methods to compute @xmath77 from first principles . for the cellular flow under investigation , by mapping the front dynamics onto a one dimensional problem ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an approximate expression for @xmath78 in good agreement with numerical data .",
    "= 8truecm = 4truecm    the strategy is to devise an equation for the edge point evolution ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tre ] ) . after the transient , in the cell @xmath79\\times[0,\\pi]$ ] , the point @xmath80 approximatively moves in the right direction along the separatrices , so that @xmath81 practically assumes values close to @xmath59 or @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , one can reduce the edge dynamics to the following @xmath83-problem @xmath84 the second term of the r.h.s .",
    "mimics the horizontal component of the velocity field , where @xmath85 takes into account the `` average '' effect of the dependence on the vertical coordinate , @xmath86 .",
    "the periodicity of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplemodel ] ) implies that there exists a time @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "then , by solving ( [ eq : simplemodel ] ) in the interval @xmath89 $ ] we computed @xmath87 and hence the front speed , @xmath90 , @xmath91 notice that ( [ eq : func ] ) is valid only for @xmath92 , which is the regime we are interested in .",
    "now the problem is to estimate @xmath85 .",
    "as stated previously the front evolution is periodic , so that @xmath81 is a periodic function of time with period @xmath93 commensurate to @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ; the front period @xmath70 should also be commensurable to @xmath87 and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , for a specific value of @xmath1 and @xmath30 we numerically identified the period @xmath93 and computed @xmath85 as @xmath94 obtaining @xmath95 . using this value in ( [ eq : func ] ) one",
    "has a remarkable agreement with the measured @xmath96 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : staz - vel ] ( the agreement is between @xmath97 and @xmath98 for all the range of investigated values of @xmath1 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "notice that , by definition , @xmath99 . therefore , with @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : func ] ) one obtains an upper bound for the front speed .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a rigorous lower bound has been provided : @xmath101 it is worth remarking that , for large @xmath1 , both the upper and lower bounds give @xmath102 , which identify the asymptotic behaviour of the front speed .",

    "[ fig : imagine ] we present two snapshots of the front for different parameters values . by comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : due ] it is clear the presence of small structures in the front due to smaller scales in @xmath9 .",
    "we computed @xmath0 for @xmath118 ( two - scales flow ) and @xmath119 ( three - scales flow ) with different values of @xmath120 , @xmath115 and random phases . in the case",

    "the physical information one can extract from the above result is that the front speed is essentially determined by the large scale behavior of the velocity field ( i.e. , the flow intensity ) .",
    "indeed , as previously observed  @xcite the absence of open channels can be more important than the detailed multi - scale properties of the flow .     as a function of @xmath123 for the flow  ( [ 2scale ] ) for various @xmath120 , @xmath115-values and @xmath30 values .",

    "this corresponds to the large @xmath1 limit of the yakhot like formula ( [ eq : yakhot ] ) with @xmath110 .",
    "our results indicate that the main effect of the small scales is to renormalize the stirring intensity .",
    "indeed once taken into account @xmath140 all the curves roughly collapse ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2scale ] ) .    however , because of the limited range of spatial scales here investigated it is difficult to say something definitive on the front propagation in a multi - scale velocity field .    from fig.s",
    "[ fig : imagine ] and [ fig:2scale ] one can see that the introduction of small scales on @xmath141 causes a roughening of the front shape at the same scales of the velocity field , and has just a minor effect on the front speed .",
    "the problem of the effect of small scales on the front wrinkling has been studied also by denet  @xcite in the context of the flame propagation equation ( fpe ) ( which is similar to the kardar parisi zhang equation @xcite ) . in that model",
    "the small scales influence on the large scale motion seems to be important .",
    "however , it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the two results , because the fpe and eq .",

    "when @xmath145 chaotic lagrangian trajectories appear @xcite .",
    "the presence of complex particle trajectories constitutes a step toward more realistic flows .",
    "we are mainly interested in addressing the two following issues .",
    "first , since trajectories starting near the roll separatrices typically have a positive lyapunov exponent , it is natural to wonder about the role of lagrangian chaos on front propagation .",
    "second , from previous works @xcite , we know that for the time dependent flow ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) the transport properties are strongly enhanced , therefore it is worth to see if similar effects are reflected also in the front speed .",
    "a direct consequence of lagrangian chaos is the exponential growth of passive scalar gradients and material lines @xcite : a ( passive ) material line of initial length @xmath146 for large times grows as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the first generalized lyapunov exponent , @xmath149 which is in general larger than the maximum lyapunov exponent @xcite .     and @xmath150 , of the evolution of passive ( top ) and reactive line of material for two values of @xmath30 ( middle @xmath151 and bottom @xmath152 ) for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",

    "develop ( due to stretching and folding ) , in the reactive one after a number of folding events structures on smaller scales are inhibited as a consequence of the huygens dynamics : the interface between the two phases merges .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible for the formation of _ pockets _ @xcite . of course , `` merging '' is more and more efficient as @xmath30 increases ( compare the middle and lower pictures of fig .  [",
    "fig : confronto ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfversust ] we show the time evolution of the line length , @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath164 for the passive and reactive material at different values of @xmath30 .",

    "the front length varies periodically with an average value depending on @xmath30 .",
    "a rough argument to estimate @xmath166 , is the following : two initially separated part of the line ( e.g. , originally at distance @xmath146 ) become closer and closer , roughly as @xmath167 .",
    "when such a distance becomes of the order of @xmath168 the merging takes place , hence to leading order @xmath169 in the asymptotic state ( @xmath165 ) both the spatial and temporal structures of the flow become periodic .",
    "let us now switch to the effects of lagrangian chaos on the asymptotic dynamics of front propagation .",
    "an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcut ] ) is that the asymptotic front length ( [ def : length ] ) behaves as @xmath170 for enough small values of @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , @xmath171 which is in fairly good agreement with the simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lfvsv0 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the steady case a different scaling can be seen .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in the inset of fig .",
    "9 we display the dependence of the front speed on @xmath30 for both the time - dependent and time - independent flow .",
    "for very small @xmath30 , when chaos is effective in enhancing the front length , one observe an increasing of the front speed . at large values of @xmath30 the time - independent flow",
    "has a larger front speed than the time - dependent one .",
    "as we will see in the next subsection , this is a consequence of the mode - locking of the dynamics , which maintains constant the value of @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth remarking that even if the scaling ( [ eq : lfvsv0 ] ) holds when chaos is present , in general it is not peculiar of chaotic flows .",
    "for instance , for the shear flow ( @xmath172 ) one has @xmath173 . on the other hand from eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) @xmath174 . therefore , even if the shear flow is not chaotic @xmath175 for @xmath176 . from the previous discussion",
    ", it seems that the front length dependence on @xmath30 is not an unambiguous effect of chaos on the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "but , comparing fig .  2 with fig .  7",
    "appears that the spatial `` complexity '' of the front in the presence of lagrangian chaos is higher than in its absence .     as a function of @xmath30 for",

    "this is indeed what one observes in fig .",
    "10 , where we show the ratio @xmath187 both for the non - chaotic and the chaotic flow . for the latter",
    "this ratio diverges for very small @xmath30 values as a signature of chaos . from a physical point of view",
    "the ratio @xmath188 is an indicator of the spatial complexity of the front .",
    "indeed it indicates the degree of wrinkling of the front with respect to the size of the region in which the front is present . loosely speaking",
    ", we can say that the _ temporal _ complexity of lagrangian trajectories converts in the _ spatial _ complexity of the front .      for passive particles transport in the flow ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) , it has been found that the eddy diffusivity coefficient @xmath189 displays a complex behavior with resonant - like patterns @xcite , in which the values of @xmath190 are orders of magnitude larger than the stationary - flow value , @xmath191 .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the resonances is related to the interplay between the oscillation of the separatrices and the circulation inside the cell .",
    "when circulation and oscillation `` synchronize '' , a very efficient and coherent way of transferring particles from one cell to the other takes place .",
    "does it happen something similar to the front speed in the reactive case ?",

    "fig : vfsuvom0 ] we report @xmath192 as a function of @xmath193 . as one can see , @xmath194 varies both above and below the time independent value , @xmath195 , and its range of variability ( about @xmath196 above or below the time independent value @xmath195 ) is very small compared with that of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the inequality @xmath197 .",
    "if one changes the value of @xmath30 then the curve display a small shift up ( increasing @xmath30 ) or down ( decreasing @xmath30 ) with some slight variations of the values of the peaks .",
    "this behavior is very robust with respect to changes of the flow parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath198 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath194 is a piece - wise linear function of @xmath61 with slope given by @xmath1 multiplied by a rational number .",
    "this phenomenon called frequency locking  @xcite naturally arises in some non linear oscillators which are periodically forced , when the oscillator synchronizes its frequency to the one of the periodic forcing .",
    "the frequency locking of the front speed can be understood with the following argument . at large times , @xmath165 , the front is time and space periodic .",
    "this means that after a time period @xmath70 , the front is rigidly translated in the @xmath73-direction by @xmath199 , which is the spatial period .",
    "due to the spatial periodicity of the flow ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) @xmath200 ( where @xmath113 integer ) .",
    "now , as confirmed by the simulations , one expects @xmath70 to be a multiple of the oscillation period @xmath201 so that : @xmath202 ( with @xmath203 integer ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the front speed is nothing but @xmath204 so that @xmath205 which is indeed the behavior we observed in fig .  [",

    "the dashed lines indicates the curves @xmath208 for different @xmath209 integers . ]",
    "varying @xmath210 the periods @xmath211 and @xmath212 with a given @xmath203 and @xmath113 can loose their stability so that a new couple of @xmath213 values is selected .",
    "this explains the presence of different linear behaviors . by generalizing the one dimensional model ( [ eq : simplemodel ] ) to the time dependent case",
    "one can qualitatively reproduce the behavior of the front speed dependence on the frequency ( see appendix  [ app : lock ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the behavior of front propagation with the time dependence ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) with previous studies that considered a different time dependence , i.e. , with @xmath214 and @xmath215 in ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) . with",
    "this choice the overall effect ( as recognized by most of authors @xcite see also @xcite ) is a depletion of the front wrinkling at increasing the flow frequency . as a consequence ,",
    "a strong bending of the front speed with respect to the steady case has been observed .",
    "this phenomenon has been quantitatively understood for the case of time dependent shear flows ( i.e. , @xmath216 ) by majda and collaborators @xcite . with the choice ( [ eq : unsteadyflow ] ) such a depletion",
    "is not observed because of the enhanced transport properties of the flow fig .",
    "[ fig : vfsuvom0 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we studied thin front propagation in steady and unsteady cellular flows .",
    "in particular , we investigated the behavior of the front speed and the front spatial structure at varying the system parameters .    as far as the one - scale steady case is concerned , we were able to give a quantitative description of the front speed by means of a simple one dimensional model . for large flow intensity @xmath1 ( or @xmath104 equivalently ) ,",
    "the front speed behaves as @xmath217 , which corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the yakhot - like formula ( [ eq : yakhot ] ) with @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , small scales structures have been added to the flow in order to study their effect on the front speed .",
    "numerical simulations show that , once @xmath0 is rescaled with @xmath30 and reported as a function of @xmath123 , the results for the one - scale flow and those for more than one - scale fairly collapse onto a single curve .",
    "therefore , the front speed is essentially determined by the large scale behavior of the velocity field .",
    "small scales spatial structures may also be induced by lagrangian chaos . in this respect , on the basis of our results on the unsteady cellular flow",
    "it is interesting to remark that the effect of chaos is limited to a transient , in which the front behavior is close to the passive scalar case .",
    "asymptotically , the reacting term induces a drastic regularization on the front evolution , suppressing the effects of small scales and lagrangian chaos .",
    "indeed the front propagates periodically and displays a frequency locking phenomenon .",
    "the only asymptotic effect of lagrangian chaos is in the structure of the front which is more and more wrinkled as @xmath30 approaches to zero . on the contrary in the case of steady velocity fields ( regular lagrangian motion )",
    "the degree of irregularity does not change with @xmath30 . as an indicator of the spatial `` complexity '' of the front we used the ratio between the front length and the width , @xmath188 which is large ( diverging as @xmath218 ) for the unsteady case and is roughly constant for the steady one .",

    "in numerical approaches one is forced to discretize both space and time .",
    "we introduce a lattice of mesh size @xmath219 and @xmath220 ( where we assume @xmath221 ) so that the scalar field is defined on the points @xmath222 : @xmath223 .",
    "+ the time discretization implies a discretization of the dynamics .",
    "looking at the g - equation  ( [ eq : geq ] ) one immediately recognize two different terms : the advection term @xmath224 , accounting for the transport properties of the flow , and the `` optical '' term @xmath225 , which locally propagates the front in a direction perpendicular to it with a bare velocity @xmath30 .",
    "let us call @xmath226 the lagrangian propagator for the discretized advection equation , @xmath227 .",
    "then , given the field at time @xmath164 one can computes the field at time @xmath228 using a two steps algorithm :    * using the lagrangian propagator , @xmath229 , one evolves each point of the interface between burnt and unburnt region ; * at each point of the evolved interface one constructs a circle of radius @xmath230 , obtaining the new frontier as the envelope of the circles .",
    "the numerical algorithm can be easily implemented using a time reversal procedure : starting on a grid point , @xmath231 , of the scalar field at time @xmath232 one applies the backward evolution obtaining the point @xmath233 at time @xmath164 .",
    "around @xmath86 we construct the circle of radius @xmath230 .",
    "if in this circle there is at least one burnt point of the scalar field at time @xmath164 , we fix @xmath234 otherwise @xmath235 .",
    "it is worth to note that one has to care about the radius of circle @xmath230 that has to be larger than the grid - size @xmath219 ( empirically we found that @xmath236 it is enough to give good results ) .",
    "typical values used in our simulation are @xmath237 , @xmath238 .",
    "the backward lagrangian integration @xmath239 has been performed with a @xmath240-th order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "frequency locking arises in many physical systems ranging from josephson - junction arrays to chemical reactions and non linear oscillators @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism is a resonance effect between two oscillators or when an oscillator is coupled with an external periodic forcing . in the last case the system synchronizes with the external forcing making its internal frequency commensurable with the external one .",
    "almost all the systems displaying frequency locking can be mapped to the damped forced non linear oscillators @xcite : @xmath241 the solution @xmath242 is periodic and the frequency , i.e. , the average angular velocity , turns out to be : @xmath243 with @xmath244 integers",
    ". moreover , if ( [ eq : lock ] ) is realized for a certain set of the parameters there always exist an entire interval around their values where ( [ eq : lock ] ) holds with the same values of @xmath203 and @xmath113 .",
    "this kind of behavior persists also when @xmath245 and for other kind of non linear terms ( i.e. , the third term of the l.h.s . ) .",
    "an exhaustive description of such a phenomenon can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      coming back to our system",
    ", we can generalize the @xmath83-model ( [ eq : simplemodel ] ) to the time dependent case : @xmath247 note that in principle one should also take into account the dynamics of @xmath248 , but for the sake of simplicity we present just the @xmath86-independent version of the model .",
    "this model , although very idealized , is able to reproduce behaviors qualitatively similar to the ones observed in the simulations ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : figmodello ] ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : vfsuvom0 ] ) . by changing of variables @xmath249 eq .",
    "( [ eq : modello ] ) reduces to @xmath250 which corresponds to ( [ equazione ] ) for @xmath245 , and for which frequency locking has been studied in details .",
    "it is interesting to quote a recent work @xcite which has studied the problem of locking in a model very similar to ( [ eq : modello1 ] ) but in presence of noise .",
    "they found that the locking phenomenon is rather robust under the effect of noise and , moreover , it gives rise to resonances in the diffusion coefficient .",
    "all these results are qualitatively very similar to the behavior of the system here studied .",
