    "pion polarizabilities are fundamental structure parameters characterizing the behavior of the pion in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities arise as @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms , respectively , in the expansion of the non - born amplitude of compton scattering in powers of the initial photon energy @xmath5 . in terms of the electric @xmath6 ( @xmath71 , 2 ) and magnetic @xmath8 dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities ,",
    "the corresponding effective interactions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the forms @xcite : h^(2)_eff=-124(_1 ^ 2+_1 ^ 2 ) , h^(4)_eff=-4(_2e^2_ij+ _",
    "2h^2_ij ) , where e_ij=12(_ie_j+_je_i ) , h_ij=12(_ih_j+_jh_i ) are the quadrupole strengths of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the dipole polarizabilities ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) of the pion measure the response of the pion to quasistatic electric and magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast , the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 measure the electric and magnetic quadrupole moments induced in the pion in the presence of an applied field gradient . in what follows ,",
    "the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities are given in units @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the values of the pion polarizabilities are very sensitive to predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "therefore , an accurate experimental determination of these parameters is very important for testing the validity of such models . in particular ,",
    "the determination of the difference of the electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities is of major importance .",
    "the value of this difference found from the radiative @xmath2 meson photoproduction from the proton at mami @xcite is equal to @xmath15 and close to the value obtained from scattering of high energy @xmath1 mesons off the coulomb field of heavy nuclei in serpukhov @xcite assuming @xmath16 and equal to @xmath17 .",
    "however , these values differ from the prediction of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) ( @xmath18 @xcite ) .",
    "the experiment of the lebedev physical institute on radiative pion photoproduction from the proton @xcite has given @xmath19 .",
    "this value has large error bars but nevertheless shows a large discrepancy with regard to the chpt predictions as well .",
    "attempts to determine the charged pion dipole polarizabilities from the reaction @xmath0 suffered greatly from theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "the analyses @xcite have been performed in the region of low energy ( @xmath20  mev , where @xmath21 is the square of the total energy in @xmath22 c.m .",
    "system ) . in this region",
    "the values of the experimental cross sections of the process under consideration @xcite are very ambiguous . as a result , the values of @xmath23 found lie in the interval 2.226.3 .",
    "the analyses of the data of mark ii @xcite have given @xmath23 close to the chpt result .",
    "however , even changes of the dipole polarizabilities by more than 100% are compatible with the present error bars in the energy region considered @xcite .",
    "the experimental information available so far for the dipole polarizabilities of the charged pions is summarized in table i.    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the experimental values of the sum and the difference of the dipole polarizabilities of @xmath24 and the difference of its quadrupole polarizabilities do not conflict within the errors with the predictions of dsrs and chpt . however , there are very big errors in the experimental values for the difference of the dipole polarizabilities . therefore , it is difficult to draw a more unambiguous conclusion . for the sum of the quadrupole polarizabilities of @xmath24 ,",
    "the dsr result agrees well with the experimental value , but chpt predicts a positive value , in contrast to the experimental result .",
    "however , as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this quantity was obtained in a two - loop approximation , which is a leading order result for this sum , and one expects substantial corrections to it from three - loop calculations .",
    "the dispersion relations at fixed @xmath21 with one subtraction at @xmath25 have been constructed for the invariant helicity amplitudes of the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the subtraction functions were determined with the help of the drs at fixed @xmath25 with two subtractions at @xmath26 , where the subtraction constants were expressed through the dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the charged pion .",
    "these drs , where the sum and the difference of the dipole and the quadrupole charged pion polarizabilities were free parameters , were used to fit the experimental data to the total cross section of the process @xmath0 in the energy region from threshold to 2.5 gev .    as a result",
    ", the dipole and the quadrupole polarizabilities have been found .",
    "the quadrupole charged pion polarizabilities have been determined for the first time .",
    "the value of the difference of the dipole polarizabilities @xmath27 found agrees well with results obtained at mami @xcite and in serpukhov @xcite and with the dsr predictions whereas it is at variance with the recent calculations in the frame work of chpt @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculations of the angular distributions for the process under consideration , using the drs constructed in the present work and the values of the dipole and the quadrupole polarizabilities ( [ famc])([fbpc ] ) , are in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
