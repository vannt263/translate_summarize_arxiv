    "the concept of weak value was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is the complex number @xmath0 in terms of which one can express @xmath1 , the average result of a measurement of an observable @xmath2 preceded by a preparation in the state @xmath3 and followed by a postselection of the state @xmath4 , provided that the interaction between the system and the detector , which we shall call the probe as a reminder of its quantum nature , is weak enough compared to the coherence scale of the latter @xcite .    under the assumptions of @xcite , for a weak analogue of an ideal von neumann measurement , the average value is given by @xmath5 .",
    "a surprising result is that this average value can lie well outside the range of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "this fact has been confirmed experimentally @xcite in optics .",
    "also , the formalism of the weak value was proved to describe some relevant phenomena in telecom fibers @xcite , and to be connected with the response function of a system @xcite .",
    "the possibility of performing a weak measurement in solid state systems is currently being investigated @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the initial state of the probe is assumed a pure gaussian state , with a special choice of the phase , and the free evolution of the probe is neglected . since the coherence of the probe is an essential requisite for the weak value to be significant , and since the hamiltonian evolution induces a relative phase between different components of the state of the probe , the latter assumption seems unrealistic , especially for a measurement lasting a finite time .    in this paper",
    "we calculate @xmath6 for any initial state of the probe and for any interaction strength [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : instgenprob]),([eq : genweakval ] ) ] . in the limit of a weak interaction ,",
    "we show that including the free evolution of the probe gives rise to a contribution @xmath7 to @xmath6 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : genweakval2 ] ) ] ; this , generally , does not change the main property of the weak measurement , namely that @xmath6 can lie well outside the spectrum of @xmath2 .",
    "we then consider , as a special example , a probe prepared in a general gaussian state , including the state assumed in @xcite as a particular case , and we provide additionally an expression for the variance @xmath8 , eq .  .",
    "finally , we take @xmath2 to be a spin component , as a simple illustration ; we discuss the regime where the weak value does not apply , providing formulas for the extrema of @xmath6 , @xmath9 as a function of the postselection [ eqs.([eq : maxpos],[eq : maxval],[eq : spreadmin],[eq : spreadmax ] ) ] .",
    "let us consider a quantum system prepared , at time @xmath10 , in a pure state @xmath3 ( preselection ) .",
    "we denote the hamiltonian of the system by @xmath11 .",
    "the system interacts , at time @xmath12 , with another quantum system , the probe , through @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is an operator on the system s hilbert space , @xmath14 on the probe s , and @xmath15 is a function vanishing outside a finite interval @xmath16 $ ] , with @xmath17 . for the measurement to be ideal ,",
    "if @xmath2 is not conserved , the interaction must be instantaneous , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; otherwise , if @xmath2 is conserved , i.e. @xmath20=0 $ ] , the interaction can last a finite time , and the measurement is a non - demolition one @xcite .",
    "the probe is prepared , at time @xmath21 , in a state described by the density matrix @xmath22 , and its free evolution is governed by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the conjugate observable of @xmath14 . the operator @xmath24 is the observable of the probe that carries information about the measured quantity @xmath2 .",
    "we notice that , in order for the measurement to be ideal , @xmath24 must be conserved during the free evolution of the probe , and change only due to the interaction with the observed system .     a schematic view of the measurement with pre- and post - selection , the horizontal direction representing increasing time .",

    "since @xmath24 is conserved during the free evolution of the probe , this value will not depend on the time @xmath30 .",
    "the observed value of non - conserved quantities , by contrast , would depend on @xmath30 .",
    "will have at time @xmath30 in the absence of interaction with the measured system , and hence infer something about the measured system from the value of @xmath31 observed in the presence of interaction .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of quantum mechanics , this is no longer possible : the uncertainty on a non - conserved quantity will generally spread with time . for this reason , in an ideal measurement , the pointer variable is required to be conserved . ] finally , only those trials in which the last measurement on the system gave an arbitrarily fixed outcome @xmath32 will be selected ( postselection ) .",
    "the procedure detailed above describes a measurement with pre- and post - selection . in fig .",
    "we provide a sketch of the procedure .",
    "the joint probability of observing the outcome @xmath33 for the probe , at any time @xmath29 and @xmath34 for the system , at time @xmath35 , is given by born s rule @xmath36 ( t_{i}-t_{p})/\\hbar}\\\\ & \\times \\rho(p_0,p_0 ' ) \\langle \\tilde{s}_{f}|\\langle p| \\mathcal{u}_{t_{i},t_{f } }    \\mathcal{u}_{t_{i},t_{f}}^\\dagger |\\tilde{s}_{f}\\rangle |p\\rangle % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the time evolution operator for @xmath38 , we introduced @xmath39 the probe density matrix in the @xmath40 basis , and @xmath41 . after introducing twice the identity resolved in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath42 } \\\\ \\label{eq : instgenprob }   & \\times   \\langle \\tilde{s}_{f}| a \\rangle \\langle a|\\tilde{s}_{i}\\rangle \\langle \\tilde{s}_{i}| a'\\rangle \\langle a'|\\tilde{s}_{f}\\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath2 and @xmath44 for an instantaneous interaction , @xmath45 in eq .   and elsewhere in this paper should be interpreted as being a time infinitesimally later than the interaction . in deriving eq .  , we exploited @xmath46\\!/\\!\\hbar }   |p_0\\rangle & = \\delta\\!\\left(p\\!-\\!p_0\\!-\\!\\int_0^t ds f(s)\\right ) \\\\ & \\times\\!e^{-i\\!\\int_0^t\\!ds\\!h_{p}\\left(\\!p\\!-\\!\\int_s^{t}\\!ds ' f\\!(s')\\!\\right)\\!/\\!\\hbar}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that if no postselection were made ( i.e. if one would sum over the final states @xmath4 ) , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath39 would not contribute to eq . .",
    "the conditional probability of obtaining outcome @xmath33 , given that the state has been postselected in @xmath34 , is @xmath47 where we applied bayes rule , and the expected value inferred for the system through observation of the probe @xmath48    since what matters is the deviation of the pointer @xmath33 from its unperturbed expected value @xmath49 , we can set the latter to be zero without loss of generality .",
    "we notice that the inference assigning the quantity @xmath50 to the system when observing the probe to have the value @xmath33 is valid only when initially the probe has a precise enough value of @xmath33 close to zero .",
    "we can , however , keep assigning the value to the system even when the probe is not sharply prepared around @xmath51 , and say that we observed a value @xmath52 for the measured system ( and correspondingly we shall define a probability @xmath53 ) .",
    "this value is not necessarily one of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 , and , as shown in @xcite , it can even lie outside the range @xmath54 $ ] ( for this reason we are indicating with @xmath55 the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and with @xmath52 the outcome of each individual measurement ) .",
    "a measurement is weak when the coupling @xmath56 is small compared to the coherence length of the probe , i.e. to the range of @xmath57 within which @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "this can be evinced from eq . .",
    "in the following , we shall assume that @xmath39 is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath58 .",
    "then , to lowest order in @xmath56 , the denominator in eq .",
    "is @xmath59 . before analysing the numerator in eq . , we rewrite @xmath60 , with @xmath61 symmetric and antisymmetric real functions , respectively .",
    "we have then that the numerator in eq . is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the initial distribution of the @xmath33 observable of the probe , @xmath64 and the bar symbol denotes the average over @xmath65 . after introducing the weak value , i.e. the complex number @xmath66 ,",
    "the average value is @xmath67 eq .",
    "holds as far as the product of the prepared and the postselected state is larger than the first nonvanishing contribution in the @xmath56 expansion for the denominator . in the latter case",
    ", one should keep the latter contribution as well .",
    "we notice that the contribution of the imaginary part has been generally overlooked in the literature , due to the neglecting of the hamiltonian of the probe and to the choice of a very special phase @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    ", it has been proved @xcite,@xcite that observing the @xmath14 variable of the probe one gets an average value which is proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath69 .",
    "this is true only if one neglects the time evolution of the probe from preparation to observation .",
    "when this evolution is accounted for , the observed value of @xmath14 depends also on the details of the free hamiltonian of the probe and on the time of observation . to the best of our knowledge , the first paper to point out that @xmath70 contributes to @xmath71 was reference @xcite .",
    "there , however , the readout variable @xmath24 ( which in the notation of @xcite is actually @xmath14 ) is not conserved during the free evolution of the probe .",
    "thus the results presented in @xcite hold only if the system - probe interaction is instantaneous , and if the probe is read immediately after the interaction . indeed ,",
    "if the interaction is instantaneous , the probe is prepared at time @xmath72 and it is observed at time @xmath30 , the central result , eq.(17 ) , of ref .",

    "the formula agrees with the more general eq .  , since for a generic @xmath91 @xmath92 which reduces to @xmath93 . for a generic hamiltonian @xmath94 ,",
    "if instead of observing @xmath24 , one observes the `` velocity '' operator @xmath95 , one has @xmath96",
    "so far , in the literature on the weak measurement , the probe was assumed to be prepared in a pure gaussian state .",
    "the corresponding density matrix @xmath39 is characterized by the identity between the scale in @xmath57 over which its off - diagonal elements vanish ( the coherence length scale ) and the scale over which the diagonal elements decay going away from the zero value ( the classical uncertainty spread in @xmath33 ) .",
    "we shall consider a more general gaussian distribution @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the initial spread and @xmath99 the coherence scale .",
    "positive semidefineteness requires @xmath100 .",
