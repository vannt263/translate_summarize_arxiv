    "kramers @xcite diffusion model of chemical reactions proposed in 1940 forms the dynamical basis of modern rate theory of activated processes .",
    "the seminal and essential content of this nonequilibrium formulation is the inclusion of dependence of rate constant of a reaction on viscosity or friction of the reaction medium .",
    "based on the classical theory of brownian motion in phase space kramers derived the expressions for nonequilibrium steady state distribution functions to work out the rate coefficients in the two different limiting situations and showed that the rate varies linearly in the weak dissipation regime and inversely in the high dissipation regime with friction .",
    "that is , in between the energy diffusion and spatial diffusion limited regimes the rate constant as a function of friction exhibits a bell - shaped curve - known as kramers turnover . with the advent of ultrafast lasers and time - resolved detection techniques since late seventies , experimental confirmation of kramers theory provided a new impetus for further development in chemical dynamics and condensed matter physics @xcite .    in spite of this spectacular growth one point however",
    ", that remained illusive for several decades was the absence of an analytic rate formulae which correctly interpolates the two limits .",
    "a significant advancement was made in 1986 when melnikov and meshkov @xcite proposed a theory of kramers turnover for markovian friction .",
    "the key point of this analysis is the calculation of an average energy loss of the system due to its weak coupling with the bath modes near the top of the potential barrier .",
    "the approach was further extended to non - markovian domain by pollak , grabert and hnggi @xcite within the framework of a normal mode description of the system plus reservoir , where the implementation of an _ ad hoc _ function in the expression for the spatial diffusion limited rate could be avoided .",
    "subsequent to this formulation of classical theory , the problem of quantum kramers turnover was addressed by rips and pollak @xcite .",
    "the degree of accuracy of classical and quantum theories has been tested by numerical simulation of reaction rate with model potentials .",
    "we refer to refs.11 - 16 for further details .",
    "the classical theory @xcite of kramers turnover uses a langevin description that governs the dynamics of the system by an infinite number of harmonic oscillators coupled linearly to the system degree of freedom . very recently based on a coherent state representation of noise operator and a positive definite wigner canonical thermal distribution of harmonic oscillators @xcite of the bath",
    "we have proposed a c - number quantum langevin equation @xcite in the context of quantum rate theory and stochastic processes in terms of phase space function formalism @xcite .",
    "it would seem that one should be able to analyze a quantum turnover for arbitrary noise correlation and temperature by using such a c - number formulation .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper . in what follows",
    "we make use of a c - number hamiltonian in the normal mode procedure and take care of the nonequilibrium dynamics at the barrier top by calculating the average quantum energy loss of the unstable mode due to its weak coupling with the stable bath modes and equilibriation in the well by a wigner thermal distribution .",
    "besides being an approach based on canonical quantization the theory specifically addresses the following three points : first , we quantize the system mode to make the theory applicable beyond the activated tunneling regime down to absolute zero .",
    "second , although harmonic approximation is a good description at the barrier top , actual shape and nonlinearity of the system potential is important at low temperatures ; but systematic corrections to harmonic approximation have hardly been envisaged .",
    "the present formulation takes care of quantum corrections due to nonlinearity of the system degrees of freedom order by order .",
    "again even in the lowest order this quantum correction can be , in principle , a contribution in the weak coupling between the stable and unstable modes for calculation of energy loss and dispersion as shown in this paper .",
    "third , we take into account of the quantum correction to grote - hynes dynamical factor in the rate expression down to vaccum limit .",
    "this reduces to well - known high temperature quantum correction or the wolynes @xcite term in the appropriate limit .",
    "the approach thus generalizes the wolynes term in the deep tunneling regime .",
    "the outlay of the paper is as follows . in the following section",
    "ii we discuss our c - number quantum langevin equation which allows us to realize a c - number hamiltonian analyzed by pollak s normal mode analysis .",
    "the equilibrium theory in terms of wigner distribution function to formulate a quantum counterpart of multidimensional transition state theory ( tst ) has been presented in sec.iii .",
    "sec.iv is devoted to nonequilibrium dynamics of the unstable mode and its average energy loss over round trip time in the well near the barrier top . since this energy is sensitive to quantum contribution due to nonlinearity of the potential we calculate the quantum correction to energy loss of the unstable mode explicitly in sec.v .",
    "an explicit example with cubic potential has been worked out in sec.vi to compare with the known results .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec.vii .",
    "we consider a particle of unit mass coupled to a medium comprised of a set of harmonic oscillators with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this is described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath1    here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are co - ordinate and momentum operators of the particle and the set @xmath4 is the set of co - ordinate and momentum operators for the reservoir oscillators coupled linearly to the system through their coupling coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath6 is due to the external force field for the brownian particle .",
    "the co - ordinate and momentum operators follow the usual commutation relations [ @xmath7 = @xmath8 and [ @xmath9 = @xmath10 .    eliminating the reservoir degrees of freedom in the usual way we obtain the operator langevin equation for the particle ,    @xmath11    where the noise operator @xmath12 and the memory kernel @xmath13 are given by    @xmath14\\ ] ]    and    @xmath15    here masses",
    "have been assumed to be unity .",
    "the eq.([2 ] ) is the well known exact quantized operator langevin equation for which the noise properties of @xmath12 can be derived by using a suitable initial canonical distribution of the bath co - ordinate and momentum operators at @xmath16 as follows ;    @xmath17    where @xmath18 refers to quantum statistical average on bath degrees of freedom and is defined as    @xmath19    for any operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 at @xmath16 . by trace",
    "we mean the usual quantum statistical average .",
    "eq.([6 ] ) is the fluctuation - dissipation relation with the noise operators ordered appropriately in the quantum mechanical sense .    to construct a c - number langevin equation",
    "we proceed from eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "we first carry out the _ quantum mechanical average _ of eq.([2 ] )    @xmath22    where the quantum mechanical average @xmath23 is taken over the initial product separable quantum states of the particle and the bath oscillators at @xmath16 , @xmath24 . here",

    "it is important to note that @xmath33 of eq.([8 ] ) is a classical - like noise term which , in general , is a non - zero number because of the quantum mechanical averaging and is given by @xmath34 ;    @xmath35\\ ] ]    it is convenient to rewrite the @xmath36-number equation ( [ 8 ] ) as follows ;    @xmath37    to realize @xmath38 as an effective c - number noise we now introduce the ansatz that the momenta @xmath39 and the shifted co - ordinates @xmath40 , @xmath41 of the bath oscillators are distributed according to a canonical distribution of gaussian form as    @xmath42 } { 2 \\hbar \\omega_j \\left ( \\bar{n}_j(\\omega_j ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ) } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    so that for any function of the quantum mechanical mean values @xmath43 the statistical average @xmath44 is    @xmath45    here @xmath46 indicates the average thermal photon number of the @xmath47-th oscillator at temperature @xmath48 and @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 is the normalization constant .",
    "the distribution ( [ 11 ] ) and the definition of statistical average ( [ 12 ] ) imply that @xmath38 must satisfy    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    that is , @xmath36-number noise @xmath38 is such that it is zero - centered and satisfies the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) as expressed in eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the ansatz ( [ 11 ] ) is a canonical wigner distribution for a shifted harmonic oscillator @xcite which remains always a positive definite function .",
    "a special advantage of using this distribution is that it remains valid as pure state non - singular distribution function at @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , this procedure allows us to _ bypass the operator ordering _ prescription of eq.([6 ] ) for deriving the noise properties of the bath in terms of fluctuation - dissipation relation and to identify @xmath38 as a classical looking noise with quantum mechanical content .",
    "we now return to eq.([10 ] ) to add the force term @xmath54 on both sides of eq.([10 ] ) and rearrange it to obtain    @xmath55    where we put @xmath56 and @xmath57 for notational convenience and    @xmath58    represents the quantum correction due to the system degrees of freedom .",
    "eq.([16 ] ) offers a simple interpretation .",
    "this implies that the quantum langevin equation is governed by a @xmath36-number quantum noise @xmath38 originating from the heat bath characterized by the properties ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) and a quantum fluctuation term @xmath59 @xcite characteristic of the non - linearity of the potential @xcite .",

    "apart from usual kramers-grote - hynes term @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the term arising out of classical transition state result , eq.(3.10 ) contains two important factors .",
    "first , an exponential arrhenius term where the usual thermal factor @xmath143 is replaced by @xmath144 includes quantum effects due to heat bath at very low temperature . in the high temperature limit it reduces to @xmath143 and one recovers the usual boltzmann factor",

    "second term @xmath145 can be identified as the quantum correction to grote - hynes factor or more precisely a vacuum corrected generalized wolynes contribution for quantum transmission and reflection for the finite barrier . while usual wolynes term takes care of the quantum effects at the higher temperature the factor @xmath145 incorporates quantum effects at arbitrary low temperature . in what follows",
    "we show that the usual wolynes term can easily be recovered for @xmath145 in the appropriate limit .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we begin by noting that @xmath146 in @xmath145 which is given by    @xmath147    is the bose distribution @xmath148 . neglecting the vacuum contribution @xmath149 from the terms like @xmath150 and keeping only the leading order quantum contribution in the thermal limit",

    "both @xmath145 and the wolynes factor become unity in the classical limit .",
    "we conclude by noting that unlike wolynes factor @xmath152 , @xmath145 is valid below cross - over temperature .",
    "the rate formula ( [ 54 ] ) is quite general and requires the knowledge of @xmath161 . in the last section the quantum version of kramers-grote - hynes estimation of this rate rests on the replacement of @xmath161 by an equilibrium wigner distribution function in phase space . a determination of @xmath161 from the dynamics of the energy diffusion process , however is based on the solution of the integral equation originally formulated by melnikov @xcite and subsequently by others @xcite ,    @xmath162    which implies that @xmath161 can be determined by a conditional probability function @xmath163 that a system escaping the barrier region with energy @xmath164 of the unstable mode makes a round trip of the barrier with an energy between @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "deep inside the well , the strong coupling between the stable and unstable modes brings @xmath161 close to its equilibrium value @xmath167 , whereas a weak coupling prevails where the energy is close to the barrier energy . a detailed consideration of this weak coupling between the stable and unstable modes results in the conditional probability function @xmath168 which when made use in ( [ 56 ] ) gives the rate constant beyond the multidimensional tst limit .    to proceed",

    "an important point is noteworthy .",
    "in contrast to classical theories where @xmath173 is purely an anharmonic classical contribution , @xmath174 , the present treatment incorporates quantum effects due to nonlinearity of the system potential @xmath175 entangled with quantum dispersion terms as given in eq.([29 ] ) .",
    "since the coupling between the stable and unstable normal modes is very sensitive to the small variation of energy we expect the quantum effect to contribute significantly to the energy loss mechanism and hence the calculation of depopulation factor .",
    "this is an important point of departure from the earlier treatment of rips and pollak who had considered the unstable mode to be classical and neglected this contribution .",
    "the applicability of the theory is thus not restricted to socalled activated tunneling region only .    defining a smallness parameter @xmath176 as @xmath177 and @xmath178",
    "we may write the zero order equation of motion for the unstable mode as    @xmath179    and for the stable modes as    @xmath180    where @xmath181 is a forcing function given by    @xmath182    the parameter @xmath183 is for weak coupling .",

    "the quantum rate is a product of several terms .",

    "the second is the classical kramers-grote - hynes factor for arbitrary frequency dependent friction . the third term @xmath145 as given by ( [ x3 ] ) corresponds to equilibrium quantum correction to kramers-grote - hynes factor which reduces to high temperature quantum correction or wolynes term in the appropriate limit as shown in sec.iii .",
    "the fourth term refers to the wigner s canonical thermal distribution in the harmonic well and reduces to the usual arrhenius factor in the classical limit when @xmath213 for @xmath214 this term takes care of the quantum effects of the heat bath which thermalizes the particle inside the well .",
    "the vacuum term @xmath149 prevents the distribution from being singular as one approaches to absolute zero .",
    "therefore a significant contribution of quantum correction due to heat bath to the rate enters through both equilibrium wigner function and @xmath145 .",
    "the last term , the quantum depopulation factor is essentially due to the weak coupling of the c - number unstable normal mode with the stable modes at the barrier top .",
    "this quantity signifies the nonequilibrium nature of the dynamics at the barrier top and depends on the average energy loss of the c - number unstable mode as well as on the energy dispersion .",
    "since both of them are sensitive to the coupling , we emphasize that the quantum effect due to nonlinearity of the system makes its presence felt in these quantities .",
    "apart from these couplings , quantum nature of the system is also manifested in @xmath190 , the round trip time , for a complete traversal in the well .",
    "the latter point can be understood more explicitly as we go over to section vi .    before closing this section",
    "we point out that ( i ) because of low temperature quantum correction to kramers-grote - hynes factor , the quantum nature of the unstable mode , and a wigner description of probability distribution inside the well , the rate expression is valid both above and below the cross - over temperature .",
    "thus this works well below the socalled activated tunneling regime down to vacuum limit .",
    "( ii ) since in this present calculation the dissipation effects are not restricted to markovian limit , the rate expression is valid for arbitrary frequency - dependent friction .",
    "( iii ) finally from the expressions for the two primary quantities that determine the quantum depopulation factor , _",
    "i.e. _ , the average energy loss @xmath195 and energy dispersion @xmath215 it is apparent that the classical limit of the depopulation factor can be recovered by reducing these two quantities in the limit @xmath216 and neglecting quantum correction in @xmath173 .",
    "the result is the classical depopulation factor @xcite .",
    "( iv ) an important advantage of the present c - number scheme is that it allows us to use a gaussian kernel ( [ 71 ] ) which is exactly _ classical in form _ ( as used by melnikov and meshkov ) _ but quantum mechanical in its content _ since the energy loss @xmath195 and the dispersion @xmath217 $ ] are quantum mechanical in character .",
    "the quantum - classical correspondence thus be immediately restored . the rate expression ( [ 76 ] )",
    "reduces to its classical non - markovian expression at high temperature where @xmath218 becomes @xmath143 so that the wolynes factor @xmath145 goes over to unity and the depopulation factor takes its classical value .",
    "we obtain the expression for pollak - grabert - hnggi as follows :    @xmath219}{[\\lambda^{\\prime 2}+1/4]}\\;d\\lambda^\\prime\\right ] \\label{x12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath195 as given by ( [ 66 ] ) quantum corrections arising out of system nonlinearity .",
    "the key issue in kramers turnover problem is the calculation of energy loss @xmath195 of the unstable mode during its round trip in the well over a time @xmath190 .",
    "this is extremely sensitive to coupling of the stable and the unstable modes described in terms of the equations of motion for the normal modes ( [ 59 ] ) and ( [ 60 ] ) .",
    "the present calculation by virtue of considering the quantum system mode takes care of this loss through @xmath184 or through the nonlinearity of the system potential @xmath173 .",
    "furthermore the time @xmath190 depends explicitly on the quantum corrections as may be seen in the next section .",
    "thus the quantum corrections @xmath220 ( in eq.([26 ] ) ) are the key quantities that need to be determined . in an illustrative example of the next section with a cubic potential ,",
    "we show that @xmath221 is the relevant quantity for the leading order quantum correction . in the following we give a recipe for calculation of quantum corrections .",
    "we return to the operator equation ( [ 2 ] ) and put ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) to obtain    @xmath222    @xmath223    we then perform a quantum mechanical averaging over bath states with @xmath224 to get rid of the term @xmath225 .",
    "the eqs.([77 ] ) and ( [ 78 ] ) along with ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) form the key element for calculation of the quantum mechanical correction due to the nonlinearity of the potential . considering the friction kernel @xmath105 to be arbitrary ( but decaying )",
    "we may calculate the leading order quantum correction for the harmonic mode at the barrier top for which higher derivatives of @xmath72 in ( [ 78 ] ) vanish .",
    "the above equations can then be solved by laplace transformation technique to obtain    @xmath226    and    @xmath227    where    @xmath228\\ ] ]    and    @xmath229    and @xmath230 is the laplace transform of @xmath105 defined as @xmath231 . after squaring and quantum mechanical averaging eq.([79 ] )",
    "yields    @xmath232    the relevant quantum correction in @xmath173 in the leading order is @xmath221 obtained as a time average of @xmath233 .",
    "@xmath234    while for markovian friction , the above equation can be calculated analytically , one must take resort to numerical evaluation of @xmath235 and @xmath236 for arbitrary friction kernel .",
    "we emphasize that the correction @xmath221 is the leading order quantum correction for the unstable mode and the friction kernel is considered to be arbitrary in nature .",
    "thus the quantum correction due to the unstable mode affects @xmath237 as well as @xmath195 through @xmath190 and @xmath184 .",
    "the quantum nature of the heat bath on the other hand is taken care of through the width parameter of the wigner canonical thermal distribution function .",
    "it is pertinent to mention at this point that the quantum correction to the average energy loss and dispersion of energy can be calculated by including higher order contribution with the help of the basic equations ( [ 77 ] ) and ( [ 78 ] ) within the framework of the theory .",
    "however , the coupling of the unstable and the stable modes at the barrier top being weak it is sufficient to consider this leading order quantum correction for the present treatment .",
    "the theory developed so far is fairly general in the sense that it takes into account of an arbitrary form of nonlinear potential @xmath72 and a frequency dependent friction .",
    "we now consider a simple nonlinear potential of the form chosen for comparison with standard result @xcite    @xmath238    the extrema of the potential corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath239 , the respective potentials being @xmath240 and @xmath241 respectively .",
    "thus we have    @xmath242    the metastable minima is at @xmath243 .",
    "furthermore we assume a lorentian form of spectral density function , @xmath244 as    @xmath245    for which the friction kernel has an exponential form as    @xmath246    the laplace transform of @xmath13 is given by    @xmath247    we follow the classical procedure of straub , borkovec and berne @xcite to consider the potential ( [ 85 ] ) in the form of a piecewise continuous harmonic potential as    @xmath248    from the continuity of the potential @xmath72 and its derivatives at @xmath249 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath250 and @xmath251 we obtain    @xmath252    now the nonlinearity of the potential around @xmath78 can be estimated from the general expression ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 85 ] ) .",

    "the parameter space chosen for illustration of the main results depicted in figs.2 - 5 is based on the earlier work by pollak _",
    "et al _ @xcite , rips and pollak @xcite , straub _ et al _",
    "@xcite for a comparative study .",
    "the results are given below .",
    "in fig.2 we exhibit the quantum turnover by plotting the quantum rate , @xmath303 , where @xmath304 $ ] , as a function of dissipation parameter @xmath305 at three different temperatures @xmath306 ( dotted line ) and @xmath307 ( dashed line ) and @xmath308 ( solid line ) for a model potential with @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 . the calculation here been carried out with a non - markovian friction kernel for @xmath312 and the quantum correction has been taken upto second order . in order to allow ourselves a fair comparison with classical non - markovian theory of pollak , grabert and hnggi , we compare the quantum ( solid line ) curves with the corresponding classical ( dotted line ) curves at two different temperatures @xmath307 and @xmath313 in fig.3 for the same set of parameter values as in fig.2 .",
    "the following two points are noteworthy .",
    "we observe ( fig.2 ) in conformity with the earlier observation @xcite that as the temperature is lowered the maximum at which the quantum turnover occurs shifts to the left and the damping region that corresponds to classical energy diffusion regime becomes exponentially small as one approaches to absolute zero .",
    "second , we observe that the strong friction tends to make the dynamics more classical since the quantum correction is suppressed by dissipation in this regime . on the other hand differential behaviour of the rate in the classical and quantum regime",
    "is felt at weak friction regime .",
    "this is in confirmation with earlier observations . in figs.4 and 5",
    "we show a comparison of the quantum rate , @xmath303 , calculated on the basis of the present theory ( solid line ) with that of rips and pollak ( dotted line ) for @xmath314 , @xmath315 and @xmath311 at two different scaled temperatures @xmath316 and @xmath317 respectively in the markovian limit . the agreement is found to be quite satisfactory .",
    "thus although the depopulation factor in the rate expression ( [ 76 ] ) apparently differs in form from that of pollak and rips based on quantum transition probability obtained from the solution of master equation , the good numerical agreement between them can not be overlooked ( since the remaining factor in @xmath303 , the grote - hynes factor is same in both the expressions ) .",
    "figs.4 and 5 therefore serve as a consistency check of the present calculation .",
    "based on a quantum langevin equation we have constructed a c - number hamiltonian for a system plus n - oscillator bath model .",
    "this allows us to formulate a normal mode analysis to realize a c - number version of the multidimensional transition state theory and to derive a quantum expression for the total decay rate of metastable state .",
    "the result is valid for arbitrary damping strength and noise correlation and temperature down to vacuum limit .",
    "the theory is illustrated on a cubic potential with non - ohmic dissipation .",
    "the following pertinent points are noteworthy .",
    "\\(i ) we have shown that the expression for quantum rate coefficient is a product of five terms , _",
    "e.g. _ , classical well frequency , kramers-grote - hynes factor , a vacuum corrected or generalized wolynes factor representing quantum transmission and reflection , an exponential term corresponding to wigner canonical thermal distribution _",
    "i.e. _ the generalized arrhenius term and a quantum depopulation factor .",
    "of these the wigner term and the vacuum corrected wolynes term refer to equilibriation of quantum particle in the well and therefore corresponds to a c - number multidimensional transition state result .",
    "since the distribution unlike the boltzmann is valid even as @xmath318 , the quantum effect due to heat bath can be well accounted by these terms even below the activated tunneling regime .",
    "\\(ii ) the quantum depopulation factor has a form which is very much similar to its classical counterpart , although intrinsically the relevant quantities determining this factor , _",
    "i.e. _ , the average quantum energy loss and dispersion are quantum mechanical in their content .",
    "\\(iii ) the classical limit of the quantum rate expression depends on wigner , generalized wolynes and depopulation factors .",
    "it is easy to see that they reduce to arrhenius factor , unity and classical depopulation factor , respectively in the limit @xmath319 .",
    "\\(iv ) since the quantization of the nonlinear system mode adds an additional contribution to depopulation factor arising out of the weak coupling between the unstable mode and the stable modes the rate is significantly modified .",
    "\\(v ) the theory takes into account of the quantum effects in full due to heat bath , while the quantum correction due to nonlinearity of the system potential can be calculated systematically order by order to a good degree of accuracy . in the illustrative example with cubic potential we have considered the quantum correction of the second order .",
    "\\(vi ) the quantum depopulation factor interpolates the energy diffusion limited regime to spatial diffusion regime and depicts the correct turnover scenario down to absolute zero .",
    "the maximum of the turnover shifts to the low damping regime as one approaches the absolute zero . the quantum rate is significantly enhanced over the classical rate in the weak damping regime while strong dissipation overwhelms the quantum correction .",
    "\\(vii ) an important aspect of the present theory is that it takes care of activation and tunneling within a unified description and is equipped to deal with the rate at temperature down to vacuum limit .",
    "this is a distinct advantage over path integral monte carlo method since numerically the relevant propagator poses serious problem as the temperature approaches absolute zero .",
    "\\(viii ) the present theory is a synthesis of the classical formalism of normal mode analysis and weak coupling theory of unstable and stable modes for calculation of average energy loss and dispersion within the framework of our recently developed c - number quantum langevin equation .",
    "it is important to emphasize a distinct advantage of the present treatment .",
    "the present c - number formalism allows us to formulate the guassian transition probability that the energy of the unstable mode changes for one period of motion within a `` classical - like '' prescription , rather than by solving a quantum master equation restricted to a markovian description .    the quantum turnover theory as presented here",
    "is based on a canonical quantization procedure and positive definite wigner s thermal distribution for harmonic oscillators rather than path integral or master equation formalism .",
    "it can be readily applied to other models , _",
    "e.g. _ , a double well oscillator and to the problems of dephasing and related issues .",
    "the systematic improvement can be made by taking care of the quantum corrections of higher orders .    * acknowledgement * + we are thankful to dr . b. c. bag for discussions .",
