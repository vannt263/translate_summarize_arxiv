    "_  ( _ pqcd _ ) fails at small @xmath10 and that its validity at @xmath11 is a pure fluke .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that _ dl _",
    "s approach neglects the other , non - leading , poles and cuts in the complex angular momentum @xmath12-plane .",

    "s @xmath3 _ sf_description to the @xmath0-scattering case , we have constructed @xmath4 and @xmath5 _ sfs _ , presumably valid in the whole range of kinematic variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . at @xmath16",
    "they are chosen to coincide with _ pqcd _  parameterization by _",
    "collaboration @xcite , while in the small-@xmath1 region these _ sfs _  are driven by the analogous regge theory inspired description . a special interpolation procedure , developed in ref .",

    "an incident cosmic high - energy @xmath22-flux can be detected only by registration of secondary particles , the products of @xmath0- and/or @xmath23-collisions with matter ( basic ideas of _ hena _  are expounded in ref .",
    "hence , the observables are mostly rates of high - energy muons and/or of nuclear - electromagnetic cascades . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss only @xmath0-interactions , though the most remarkable process in _ hena _  is resonance cascade production via @xmath24 at @xmath25  ev @xcite .",
    "this resonance should show itself as a narrow high spike in the differential energy spectrum of cascades ; at resonance energy it exceeds essentially the ordinary @xmath0-interaction background .",
    "muons and cascades are produced via @xmath26- @xmath27 and @xmath28- @xmath29 _ dis_. and in special case of electron ( anti)neutrino @xmath26-interaction , @xmath30 both final states contribute to the same cascade , so that the whole energy of an incident neutrino is transferred in it . but the @xmath28-scattering case of @xmath31 does not differ from ( [ nunscatnc ] ) .",
    "differential and integral rates of cascade production in a detector for a model neutrino flux with a power - law decreasing energy spectrum , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the index of an integral neutrino spectrum @xmath34 ( it is commonly assumed that @xmath35 ) , may be calculated with the help of so - called differential , @xmath36 and integral , @xmath37 hadron moments @xcite .",

    "the cases of @xmath48- and @xmath28-interactions may be accounted for in a similar way : one is to substitute in ( [ dhadrmom ] ) the appropriate differential cross - section for the @xmath26 one .",
    "note that in eq.s  ( [ drateofcasc],[irateofcasc ] ) both differential and integral neutrino fluxes are taken at the cascade energy @xmath38 and that for power - law decreasing spectra ( [ spectra ] ) the following useful relation is valid : @xmath49    in the case of ( anti)neutrino @xmath26-scattering ( [ nuenscat ] ) a role of differential hadron moment belongs to the normalized @xmath26-cross - section , @xmath50 ; since now @xmath51 , @xmath52-flux in ( [ drateofcasc],[irateofcasc ] ) is to be taken at the energy of incident neutrino .",
    "in parton picture @xmath0-cross - section increases with the energy due to multiplication in number of the nucleon small-@xmath1 sea-quark contents . in the framework of non - perturbative pomeron approach such growth occurs due to specific poles in the complex @xmath12-plane .",
