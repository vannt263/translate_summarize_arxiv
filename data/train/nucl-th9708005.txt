    "one of the most prominent manifestations of internal nucleon structure is the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance which is seen , e.g. , in pion scattering and electromagnetic ( e.m . ) pion production .",
    "thus it is not surprising that a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations has been devoted to the understanding of the structure of this resonance .",
    "recently , the question of the relative strength of the electric quadrupole ( e2 ) to the magnetic dipole ( m1 ) excitation in the e.m .",
    "@xmath3 transition has become one of the central questions and is subject of numerous papers @xcite .",
    "while the m1 strength in the simplest approach is directly related to the magnetic properties of the constituents , the e2 strength may be interpreted as a measure of internal spatial deformation , i.e. , as deviation of the orbital wave functions from spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , there is considerable experimental effort to provide accurate data on pion photo- and electroproduction from the nucleon in the @xmath2 resonance region @xcite .",
    "various methods have been proposed in the literature for the isolation of the genuine resonant part of the experimentally measured multipoles which , however , give quite different answers @xcite .",
    "the general problem of such an extraction lies in the fact that the experimentally observable multipoles contain important background contributions which can not be separated in a simple and unique way , so that in most explicit evaluations a specific model is used .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the different prescriptions result in different values of resonance properties .",
    "in fact , for photoproduction the values for @xmath1 , the ratio of electric quadrupole to magnetic dipole , vary between @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( see e.g.  the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in view of the various methods used , it remains unclear how these values should be compared to each other . in other words",
    ", is there a common basis for a meaningful comparison ?    it is the purpose of this paper to address this question in greater detail . to this end",
    "we will compare three different methods which have been recently applied .",
    "they are based on ( i ) a dynamical model ( dm ) for the coupled @xmath6n-@xmath2-@xmath7n system , ( ii ) the effective lagrangian approach ( el ) , and ( iii ) the recently proposed speed plot analysis ( sp ) .",
    "we will take the dm as a common point of reference for this study .    to this end",
    "we briefly review in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] the treatment of pion photoproduction based on a dynamical model .",
    "special attention is paid to the general structure of the pion nucleon scattering and photoproduction amplitudes and the implication of unitarity .",
    "sect.[sect3 ] collects the basic formulas of the treatment of these reactions in the framework of els , and the connection between quantitities like resonance mass , coupling constants of the els and the corresponding quantities of a dm is derived .",
    "moreover , a numerical comparison is performed . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] we briefly discuss the sp and point out some shortcomings in the present application and how they can be avoided .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and some conclusions .",
    "there are two main advantages of treating e.m .  pion production dynamically , i.e. , solving for a given @xmath8 interaction the corresponding lippman - schwinger equation .",
    "first of all , it ensures that all two - body unitarity constraints are automatically respected .",
    "secondly , it provides a well defined basis for the analysis of the role of the final state interaction in the e.m .  reaction .",
    "in such a dynamical approach the model parameters are usually adjusted in order to reproduce all available on - shell data . at present",
    "the main disadvantage lies in the fact that a dynamical model requires still some purely phenomenological input , e.g. , form factors in order to regularize the driving terms of the interaction , which is essential to solve the dynamical equations .",
    "further problems are related to the neglect of three - body unitarity above two - pion threshold and to the requirements of relativity and gauge invariance .",
    "however , various improvements have been achieved recently @xcite . notwithstanding these shortcomings",
    ", such a dynamical model still provides the most satisfactory and comprehensive description .",
    "we shall first briefly review the salient features of a dynamical model for the coupled @xmath6n-@xmath2-@xmath7n system following the notation of @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space is assumed to be a direct sum of bare @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 states with corresponding projectors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . the hamiltonian is taken as @xmath13 with a background @xmath8 interaction @xmath14 , the @xmath15 vertex @xmath16 , a nonresonant @xmath17 driving term @xmath18 , and the @xmath19 vertex @xmath20 .",
    "one should note that the energy @xmath21 in the @xmath2 sector depends on the bare resonance mass @xmath22 which is a model parameter to be fitted .",
    "within such a model the elastic @xmath8 scattering amplitude @xmath23 can be split into a background term @xmath24 and a resonant part @xmath25 @xmath26 the background term is defined by the integral equation @xmath27 with the bare @xmath8 propagator @xmath28 .",
    "the resonant part @xmath29 is determined by the dressed @xmath15 and @xmath30 vertices @xmath31 and the dressed @xmath2 propagator @xmath32 , obtained from @xmath33 with the free @xmath2 propagator @xmath34 and the @xmath2 self energy @xmath35 the equations ( [ eqn : tpipi ] ) and ( [ eqn : tpipipr])-([eqn : gdeltadress ] ) are illustrated diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipi ] .",
    "we have already mentioned the fact that the driving terms of the background and resonance amplitudes contain at present phenomenological ingredients which are fitted to the experimental data .",
    "thus these amplitudes and the corresponding phases are to some extent model dependent .",
    "recently we have shown that this model dependence can be interpreted as different , unitarily equivalent representations , yielding different splittings into background and resonant amplitudes but leaving the total amplitude unchanged @xcite .",
    "the structure of the photoproduction amplitude @xmath36 is completely analogous .",
    "it again splits into a background @xmath37 , determined by @xmath38 and a resonant part @xmath39 referred to as `` dressed '' resonant amplitude .",
    "it contains the dressed @xmath19 vertex @xmath40 accordingly , one may split @xmath41 further into the so - called bare resonant part @xmath42 and a vertex renormalization @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 the diagrammatic representation of @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pigamma ] .",
    "it is obvious that for both multipole amplitudes the same formal structure holds .",
    "the form of the amplitude as discussed above is quite general below the @xmath48 production threshold . in that energy regime , the coupling to the closed @xmath49 channel may be effectively incorporated into a _ real _ , energy dependent background interaction , where the energy dependence arises through the energy dependence of the propagators in the intermediate @xmath49 states .",
    "note that such an energy dependence is already introduced by considering the crossed nucleon pole term as background mechanism @xmath50 in the ( 3,3 ) channel .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of the basic relations between on - shell matrix elements and phase shifts . in order to avoid a new notation",
    ", we will understand all amplitudes in connection with the phase shifts as the corresponding on - shell quantities .",
    "for @xmath8 scattering , the scattering amplitude reads @xmath51 with a phase space factor @xmath52 determined by the adopted normalization conventions , i.e. , the scattering matrix is given by @xmath53 the usual choice is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the on - shell momentum of the pion in the @xmath8 c.m .  frame .",
    "since the background is unitary by itself , one can define a nonresonant background phase shift @xmath56 by @xmath57 one then easily deduces for the resonant part @xmath58 where the resonance phase shift @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 here we have introduced the dressed @xmath2 mass @xmath61    neglecting small compton scattering corrections @xcite , watson s theorem states that the phase of the photoproduction amplitude below the two pion threshold is given by the hadronic @xmath8 scattering phase shift @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is real .",
    "similarly , one has for the background contribution @xmath65 with the @xmath8 scattering background phase shift @xmath56 and a real @xmath66 .",
    "it is convenient to define an additional phase @xmath67 , called photoproduction background phase @xcite , so that @xmath68 where again @xmath69 is real .",
    "one should keep in mind that this phase @xmath67 is in general different for the different multipole amplitudes .",
    "moreover , @xmath67 is determined by the elementary interaction model . in detail",
    ", one has @xmath70 for the comparison with the els it is useful to express the modulus of the total photoproduction amplitude in terms of the modulus of the resonance amplitude and the photoproduction background phase @xmath71 furthermore , for the moduli of the background and bare resonance amplitudes , one easily finds the following relations @xmath72 note that the bare amplitude @xmath42 carries the full phase @xmath62 ( see ( [ tpigdelta ] ) ) .",
    "an expression , alternative to ( [ eqn : tpig ] ) , is then @xmath73 which exhibits the resonance and background contributions to @xmath64 .    at the end of this brief review , we collect different possible definitions of @xmath74 ratios @xmath1 for the @xmath75 transition .",
    "the ratio of the full amplitudes @xmath76 is directly related to the experimentally observable multipoles which , according to watson s theorem , is a real but energy dependent quantity .",
    "the bare ratio @xmath77 is also a real number because the bare amplitudes carry the total phase as mentioned above .",
    "it is directly related to the ratio of the strengths of the coupling constants in the @xmath19 transition current and thus is energy dependent only if the coupling is energy dependent .    with respect to the ratio of the dressed multipoles ,",
    "one may define two different quantities , since the dressed multipoles carry different phases , namely the complex quantity @xmath78 or , alternatively , the ratio of the moduli @xmath79 as we will see in the next section , this latter quantity is closely related to @xmath1 defined in the el .",
    "note , that both dressed ratios are energy dependent .",
    "let us first summarize the treatment of pion scattering and pion photoproduction in the effective lagrangian approach ( el ) . here ,",
    "only the lowest order tree level feynman diagrams are considered including background and resonance contributions .",
    "subsequently , the resulting amplitude is unitarized .",
    "three different prescriptions for unitarization have been proposed in the literature , the olsson method @xcite , the noelle method @xcite and the k - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the photoproduction process on the adopted unitarization scheme has already been extensively studied by davidson , mukhopadhyay and wittman @xcite , and we follow their notation for convenience .",
    "we start by collecting the basic formulas for pion nucleon scattering in the energy region of the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the different unitarization methods can be parametrized by the following relation for the phase shift @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given by the nonresonant tree diagrams .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is interpreted as the @xmath83-channel contribution of the @xmath2 resonance and parametrized in the form @xmath84 where the constant mass @xmath85 is obtained as the zero of @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 in ( [ tand ] ) distinguishes the different unitarization methods , i.e. , @xmath88 refers to the noelle , k - matrix and olsson approach , respectively .",
    "obviously , all methods coincide in the case of a vanishing background phase shift @xmath89 . for the decay width",
    ", the following ansatz is used @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote respectively the pion momentum and the nucleon energy in the @xmath2 rest frame .",
    "furthermore , a weak energy dependence of the coupling constant @xmath93 is allowed for @xmath94 with free parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the background phase shift is parametrized as @xmath97 with free parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 to be fitted as well .    in order to establish the connection between",
    "the el and the dm one just has to cast @xmath100 of the dm into a form which corresponds to ( [ tand ] ) in terms of the corresponding dynamical quantitities .",
    "a straightforward calculation gives @xmath101 with @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given in ( [ tandr ] ) .",
    "equating now ( [ tandeldm ] ) with ( [ tand ] ) , one can express @xmath104 as function of the dm variables @xmath105 and @xmath56 , the el background phase @xmath106 and the unitarization parameter @xmath87",
    "@xmath107    by means of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : epsdef ] ) , the el quantitities @xmath85 and @xmath108 can be expressed through dm quantities .",
    "in addition , they will also depend on the el background phase @xmath106 and the unitarization parameter @xmath87 .",
    "for example , one finds for the resonance mass parameter @xmath109 where the right hand side is to be taken at @xmath110 and the dressed energy dependent mass @xmath111 is defined in ( [ dressedmass ] ) .",
    "the dependence on both the el background phase @xmath106 and the dm background phase @xmath56 reflects the representation dependence mentioned above in the discussion of the dm .",
    "if now we assume the same representation , i.e. , identify the background phases @xmath112 , then the expressions simplify considerably , yielding @xmath113 this is an implicit equation for the mass @xmath85 in the respective unitarization scheme .",
    "one has in detail @xmath114 it is easily seen that in the case of the k - matrix method , @xmath85 corresponds to the energy at which the full phase shift @xmath62 is equal to @xmath115 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath116 is not fixed a priori .",
    "for the model b of tanabe and ohta , upon which our later comparison is based , one obtains a negative sign and thus within this model @xmath85(olsson ) @xmath117(k - matrix ) @xmath118(noelle ) .    turning now to pion photoproduction , we begin with a brief summary of the treatment of this process as given in @xcite . in the el ,",
    "one starts from the tree level contributions of background and resonance terms @xmath119 for our purpose , it is not necessary to specify the explicit expressions for the real numbers @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which are given in @xcite .",
    "the unitarized amplitude then has the form @xmath122 with @xmath123 the real amplitude @xmath124 and the photoproduction background phase @xmath125 are functions of @xmath121 , @xmath120 and the phases @xmath126 and @xmath106 whose explicit form depends on the unitarization method and which will be given below .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 is then given in terms of the appropriate electric and magnetic amplitudes @xmath128 defined correspondingly as in ( [ eltree ] ) @xmath129 in the literature , the ratios @xmath130(el ) are quoted just at the energy @xmath85 of the respective unitarization scheme .",
    "now we can establish the relations between the el amplitudes @xmath128 and the dm quantities on the basis that the total @xmath8 phase shift @xmath62 and the total multipole amplitudes can be identified , i.e. , give a satisfactory fit to experimental data . in olsson s method ,",
    "the unitarized amplitude is given in the form @xmath131 with @xmath132 leading to the correspondence @xmath133 .",
    "as already pointed out by olsson @xcite , no solution arises in the case when @xmath134 , as is the case for the @xmath135 excitation of the @xmath2 .",
    "this problem is avoided , when the helicity amplitudes are unitarized instead of the multipoles @xcite .",
    "however , this trick would not work in the case of a weak resonance which is produced by one e.m .",
    "multipole only .",
    "the comparison with the dm , which has already been performed by tanabe and ohta @xcite , is based on the identification of ( [ tpigel ] ) with ( [ eqn : tpig ] ) .",
    "it yields the following relation @xmath136 it is worth noting that , when identifying the respective background contributions in el and dm , the case @xmath134 _ can not _ appear , because in the dynamical model the photoproduction background phase @xmath67 is a well defined quantity .",
    "although this relation between @xmath121 and the dressed amplitude @xmath69 depends also on the various phases of dm and el and thus does not allow a simple interpretation , one sees that the ratio @xmath1 is just the ratio of the moduli of the dressed multipoles in the dm ( see ( [ remtilde ] ) ) @xmath137    in noelle s scheme , the unitarized amplitude is given by @xmath138 which leads to the following expressions @xmath139 the connection between @xmath121 and the dm amplitudes reads @xmath140 due to the explicit appearance of the background contributions , there is again no simple interpretation for @xmath141 in terms of the dynamically calculated quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath1 becomes quite simple @xmath142 obviously , there is no simple relation between this ratio and the dynamical resonance parameters .",
    "however , if one evaluates this ratio at @xmath143 , one finds @xmath144    in the k - matrix approach , one identifies the tree level contributions as k - matrix elements .",
    "the full unitarized photoproduction amplitude reads then @xmath145 since here the following relation holds @xmath146 one finds @xmath147 comparing ( [ tpigkmatrix ] ) with ( [ tpignoelle ] ) one finds the following relation @xmath148 which immediately leads to the same energy dependent @xmath130 for the k - matrix as in noelle s approach , and thus in the k - matrix approach the ratio quoted in the literature is nothing else than the ratio of the experimental multipoles at @xmath149 .",
    "we close this section by comparing the explicit numerical values for the various ratios @xmath1 and other quantities introduced above with the dynamical model of tanabe and ohta ( model b in @xcite ) . from their model one",
    "deduces from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : m_do])-([eqn : m_dk ] ) the following @xmath2 masses : @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the ordering of the masses is due to the negative self - energy contribution of this model .",
    "it turns out , that the values obtained in this manner are not far away from the numbers quoted in @xcite , which are @xmath153mev , @xmath154mev , and @xmath155mev , respectively .",
    "the small difference in the k - matrix method has its origin in the fact that different data for @xmath62 had been fitted in both papers @xcite .    as next we calculate on the basis of the dm the coupling `` constant '' @xmath156 for the different els via the decay width @xmath157 given in ( [ eqn : gamdef ] ) using eqs .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpind ] .",
    "one readily notices a 15 percent variation of the coupling strength between olsson and k - matrix method .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence , which can be traced back to the energy dependence of the self - energy in the dm , is rather weak and similar for all three schemes but not negligible at all .",
    "at least for the simple model of tanabe and ohta , it is larger than the energy dependence allowed for by davidson _",
    "_ @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e2m1 ] we show the various e2/m1 ratios as a function of the photon lab energy .",
    "there are basically three different dressed ratios , @xmath158(olsson ) , @xmath159 $ ] , and @xmath160(k - matrix ) .",
    "note that these identifications are based on the assumption that the background contributions , which may formally be obtained by putting @xmath161 in dm and el , can be identified .",
    "the difference between the ratios is obvious .",
    "in particular , comparing @xmath162(olsson ) with @xmath159 $ ] , one readily notes quite a distinct different energy dependence , while @xmath162(k - matrix ) behaves qualitatively similar as @xmath159 $ ] , although differences remain in detail .",
    "if evaluated at the respective masses @xmath85 , we find @xmath163% , @xmath164% and @xmath165% .",
    "the difference to the results of @xcite can be traced back mainly to different prescriptions for the e.m .  and hadronic background contributions .",
    "since all ratios are based on the same dm , these different results clearly reflect the fact that a meaningful comparison is not possible . in this context",
    "we recall that except for @xmath162(k - matrix ) , the dressed ratios are representation dependent .",
    "the essential idea of the speed plot analysis ( sp ) rests on the analytic properties of the partial wave amplitude .",
    "a resonance manifests itself as a pole in the lower half plane of the second riemann sheet when continuing the amplitude into the complex energy plane .",
    "the aim of the sp is to locate the pole position and to determine the corresponding residue from the experimental data .",
    "this method , originally used in pion scattering , has been applied very recently to pion photoproduction by hanstein , drechsel and tiator @xcite . assuming a well isolated pole for the @xmath2 resonance , one can separate it by performing a laurent expansion in the vicinity of the pole , resulting in the form @xmath166 with the pole term @xmath167 and the regular part @xmath168 with constant complex coefficients @xmath169 . here",
    ", @xmath170 denotes the pole position with constant resonance mass @xmath171 and width @xmath172 , and @xmath173 and @xmath174 characterize modulus and phase of the residue .",
    "if we apply this analysis to the dm , the pole is determined as solution of @xmath175 on the second riemann sheet , which leads to a sytem of coupled equations for the resonance mass and width @xmath176\\,,\\\\ \\gamma_r & = & -2\\,\\im m\\,[\\sigma_\\delta(m_r-\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_r)]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding then the dm amplitude as in ( [ spamp ] ) , one immediately sees that the splitting into a pole and a regular part formally is not identical with the splitting into a resonance and a background part because of an additional energy dependence of the dressed resonance amplitude besides the pole contribution .",
    "however , this formal criticism may not be too relevant in the actual application if the background amplitude is very weakly energy dependent .",
    "to this end , let us first briefly review the sp of elastic @xmath8 scattering as performed by hhler @xcite to determine the resonance pole parameters ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) .",
    "it is based on the following parametrization of a resonant partial wave amplitude @xmath23 by splitting it into a background @xmath177 and a pole part @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 with @xmath181 since the @xmath2 resonance lies in the elastic region , hhler s parametrization requires in addition separate unitarity for the background .",
    "thus a real phase shift @xmath182 can be assigned by @xmath183 as discussed in sect .",
    "ii , eq .",
    "( [ tb ] ) is a natural consequence in any dynamical model . in the elastic region , of course , also the full amplitude is unitary , @xmath184 which fixes the quantity @xmath185",

    "furthermore , the width is then obtained from the half maximum values @xmath190 or from the curvature at maximum speed @xmath191 the latter should be preferred for a broad resonance but might be more difficult to evaluate numerically .",
    "hhler @xcite finds @xmath192 these values may be used to calculate @xmath182 from ( [ hoehler_ansatz ] ) for the whole energy range and to check the initial assumption with respect to the energy dependence of @xmath177 .",
    "indeed , one finds at resonance @xmath193 and only a very small variation of @xmath182 with energy which justifies the method .",
    "an important point to note so far is that @xmath177 and @xmath178 in hhler s analysis may well be considered as approximations to background and dressed amplitudes @xmath194 and @xmath195 of a certain dynamical model in a limited energy intervall around the resonance position . in view of the fact that one can generate a whole family of phase equivalent dynamical models by means of unitary transformations without changing the pole position in the complex plane",

    "this observation could also provide a possible explanation for the fact that the resulting background phase is repulsive in contrast to standard attractive background interactions as has been noted already by hhler @xcite .",
    "the recent extension of the sp to pion photoproduction by hanstein _",
    "@xcite takes as starting point the following ansatz for the photoproduction amplitude @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the photoproduction born amplitude calculated from the pseudoscalar @xmath8 lagrangian .",
    "assuming @xmath198 to be energy independent , they could determine the pole parameters @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the residue @xmath199 from the speed of the difference between the full and the born amplitude , @xmath200}{dw } \\right| .\\ ] ]    the main reason for critisizing this procedure is two - fold : ( _ i _ ) in the original sp of @xmath8 scattering @xcite born terms have not been subtracted , i.e. , the speed of the full amplitude determines the pole parameters .",

    "ours can be traced back to the phase of the background of the magnetic multipole . whereas in our ansatz the phases of both background amplitudes agree by definition with @xmath182 , which is already fixed in the analysis of @xmath8 scattering , the phase of the background @xmath218 in ( [ hanstein_ansatz ] ) is unconstrained since @xmath219 is an arbitrary complex number . as shown in fig.[fig : speedphases ] , they differ even in sign for both multipoles .",
    "only the electric background phase ( dotted curve ) is close to @xmath182 ( solid curve ) .",
    "consequently , the background and pole terms found in @xcite can not , even approximately , be identified with the background and dressed multipoles @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively , of any dynamical model .",
    "however , this is possible for our results in the approximate way discussed above .",
    "[ fig : polapprox ] shows the quality of the pole approximation , i.e. , evaluating ( [ u_ansatz ] ) with @xmath222 , in comparison with the full multipoles .",
    "clearly , the pole approximation can not reproduce the data below and above the resonance region as it not need to .",
    "in particular , it is obvious that by definition the pole approximation leads to a wrong low - energy behaviour .",
    "there remains one final point to be mentioned .",
    "it concerns the proper normalization of the amplitude for which the speed is calculated since any energy dependent normalization factor would affect the result .",
    "according to @xcite , two times the speed of the @xmath223-matrix ( which is related to the @xmath224-matrix through @xmath225 ) defines the quantity which can be interpreted as a time delay .",
    "this suggests to study the speed of the product of @xmath226 times the multipole , where @xmath55 and @xmath227 are the c.m .",
    "momenta of pion and photon , respectively .",
    "( the relation between @xmath223-matrix and multipoles can be found e.g.  in @xcite ) . since @xmath228 in the resonance region ,",
    "this factor is not negligible .",
    "we have performed this modified speed analysis ( msp ) , i.e. , identified @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ u_ansatz ] ) with @xmath226 times the multipole , instead of taking the multipole itself as before and in ref .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : residue ] ( right panel ) and table [ tab1 ] ( middle column ) . in order to allow a direct comparison with the foregoing sp , we present the msp results in terms of @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the momenta at @xmath189 . from table [ tab1 ] one obtains @xmath232 which differs significantly from @xmath233 in ( [ eq : zgamma ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have checked that the quality of the pole approximation , which can be achieved within the msp , is very similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polapprox ] .",
    "this last point shows the following : without reference to the physical interpretation of the speed in terms of the above mentioned time delay , one would not have an unique prescription for the choice of the amplitude for which the speed should be calculated and thus the whole procedure would become rather ambiguous .",
    "we have analyzed in detail different theoretical descriptions of pion photoproduction in the region of the @xmath2 resonance , namely , dynamical models , effective lagrangian approaches , and the recently proposed speed plot analysis .",
    "our main emphasis has been laid on the question to what extent genuine resonance contributions to the e.m .",
    "multipoles can be extracted , in particular , the interesting and controversely discussed e2/m1 ratio @xmath1 for the e.m .",
    "@xmath2 excitation .    as theoretical basis",
    "we have chosen a dynamical model for which we have briefly reviewed the treatment of pion nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction , in particular the separation of background and resonance properties . for the effective lagrangian approaches , we have discussed the different unitarization schemes resulting in different background and resonance contributions as pointed out already in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a priori there is no direct relation of background and resonance contributions of a dm to the corresponding ones of a el .",
    "the main reason for this is that unitarity is put in by hand in the el which does not allow the identification of the background part . only on the premises that the hadronic background phases could be identified ,",
    "the various resonance parameters like resonance mass , decay width , and e2/m1 ratio could be related .",
    "this reflects the fact , that the largely phenomenological treatment of the background introduces a unitary ambiguity or representation dependence @xcite .",
    "therefore , almost all e2/m1 ratios discussed so far are representation dependent quantities which implies that they are not observable in the strict sense .",
    "there is one exception , namely the ratios in the noelle and k - matrix approach , when evaluated at the resonance position , because they are simply given by the ratio of the full multipoles at this energy .",
    "the main problem , however , how these numbers should be compared to a given microscopic hadron model , remains unresolved .",
    "the only safe solution is to calculate the complete pion production amplitude within such a model in order to have an unambiguous and direct comparison to experimentally observable quantities .    as last topic",
    ", we have studied the recently proposed speed plot analysis of hanstein _ el al .",
    "_ we could show that the separated resonance and background contributions of their analysis can not be identified with corresponding dm quantities , since their ansatz for the background is not constrained by unitarity .",
    "for this reason , we have proposed an alternative speed plot analysis which respects the separate unitarity condition for the background .",
    "in such an analysis , the regular and pole contributions can be viewed as approximations of the background and dressed resonant contribution of a certain dynamical model . applied to the same input as hanstein _",
    ", we find a similar result for the residue of the electric multipole , whereas differences of the order of 10 percent appear for the magnetic multipole .",
    "accordingly , we obtain a slightly changed ratio @xmath234 . in addition , we have proposed a further modification of the speed analysis which was guided by the physical interpretation of the speed in terms of the time delay between incoming and outgoing wavepackets .",
    "this modification leads to a 20 percent change in the @xmath234 ratio .",
    "but again it remains unclear how @xmath234 could be compared to any microscopic hadron model .",
    "even though we have focused here on the @xmath3 , the conclusions are also valid for the case of electroexcitation and/or the excitation of higher resonances . in the latter case ,",
    "the situation is even worse due to overlapping resonances and the coupling to many pion channels , which makes a realistic dynamical calculation more difficult .",
    "we thank r.  beck and a.  m.  bernstein for many fruitful discussions . this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 201 ) ."
