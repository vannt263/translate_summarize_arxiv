    "stars of low and intermediate mass ( 0.8 - 8  m@xmath2 ) represent 95% of the evolved stars in the galaxy and , because of the initial mass function , can be important sources of enrichment of he , n and c in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . although supernovae are expected to be the main source of enrichment for most species @xcite , @xcite and @xcite predicted theoretically the possibility that planetary nebulae ( pne ) progenitor stars also produce o and ne and dredge these elements up to the stellar surface , resulting in possible enrichment of the ism . in any case , pne and the study of their abundances are clearly important tools to study stellar evolution as well as by considering elements other than those just discussed revealing the imprint of ism abundances when their progenitor stars were formed , in the galactic as well as extragalactic context .",
    "the outer layers of the intermediate mass stars , which were enriched throughout their evolution , are ejected during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and post - agb phases , and subsequently ionised by the remnant hot nucleus , referred to as the central star ( cs ) .",
    "analysis of the ionization lines formed in the ejected envelopes of these evolved stars is one of the most important ways in which the chemical and physical characteristics of the gas are studied .",
    "however , the great majority of work done in this field utilizes single slit spectroscopy to measure the ionization lines and thus is limited to obtaining average values across the observed region of the slit ( or across multiple regions , as it is sometimes done ) . utilizing single slits is extremely limiting in the analysis of these objects , especially considering the high complexity of pne morphology . in single - slit analysis ,",
    "the possible spatial variations of pne are usually ignored .",
    "however , spatial variations in the chemical and physical conditions of pne have been detected in previous works using long slits .",
    "@xcite , for example , using long - slit spectra , found that the n / o ratio varies from 0.4 to 4.2 from one region to another in the planetary nebula k  4 - 55 .",
    "moreover , also using long - slit spectra , @xcite found n / h abundance gradients in a few pne . in particular they claimed to have found overabundance factors of 2 for ngc  6826 and ngc  6543 and 5 for ngc  7009 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , another empirical study of ngc  7009 @xcite lowered the overabundance factor to at most 2 , and a detailed 3d photoionization modelling of the nebula eliminated completely the need of any overabundance to explain the observed long - slit as well the narrow - band images of the nebula @xcite . by investigating 13 bipolar pne using long - slit spectrophotometry",
    ", @xcite concluded that ( within the errors ) he , o , and n abundances are constant throughout the nebulae , and that the ne , ar , and s abundances are also constant , but their face values have systematic increases toward the outer regions of the nebulae .",
    "the latter was attributed to inaccuracies in the ionization correction factors .    in recent years a new tool for obtaining",
    "spectroscopic data has been developed .",
    "the integral field unit ( ifu ) is a tool that utilizes a square array of lenses remapped to a slit and then imaged through a spectroscope to obtain spatially resolved data @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to use this tool to investigate the spatial variations of pne parameters .",
    "they verified that there is variation on the discrepancy of the o@xmath3 abundances obtained from the collisionally excited lines ( cel s ) and optical recombination lines ( orl s ) on the studied pne .",
    "they established correlations between the ionization state of the gas and the discrepancies of o@xmath3 for 2 pne and between the discrepancy of the o@xmath3 and the abundances of c@xmath3 and o@xmath3 with the electron temperature for all 3 studied pne .",
    "similar kinds of data can be produced by a spectroscopic mapping technique developed by @xcite , in which multiple parallel long - slit spectra of a nebula are interpolated to create emission - line maps .",
    "both types of data , those obtained from ifu and those found by the spectroscopic mapping technique , enable better spatially - resolved analysis of ionised nebulae than those based on single long - slit spectra .",
    "spatially - resolved data are also critical in constraining photoionization models which are now fully three - dimensional and can produce a great number of observable quantities , including projected images for each emission line .",
    "photoionization models that utilize these constraints were obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for ngc  6369 , menzel 1 and ngc  6781 as well as by @xcite .    to further our understanding of the spatial variations of the physical and chemical properties of pne , we present in this work results of the study of ngc  40 using spectroscopic mapping . following the morphological classes of @xcite , from their h@xmath4 , [ n",
    "ii ] and [ o  iii ] images , the pn ngc  40 has an elliptical shape , which can also be seen in the h@xmath4 narrow band image obtained in our observing run ( figure  1 ) .",
    "two distinct structures are found within the main elliptical region : a bright inner rim and an outer shell . a filament - like structure",
    "can also be identified beyond the outer shell , on the northeast region .",
    "the [ o  iii ] emission , originating in a hotter , low - density medium , is located between the hot bubble and the h@xmath4 ( or [ n  ii ] ) filaments , and is better represented by a ring like structure @xcite .    in x - rays ngc  40 also shows a ring - like emission region , and the correspondence of this region with the inner rim indicates that the bright envelope , seen in the optical image , is caused by the shocked cs fast wind .",
    "the absence of x - ray emission in the region of an apparent aperture in the inner rim suggests that this wind is quite spherical @xcite .",
    "based on uv data , @xcite suggest that the c  iv 1549    emission from the nebular envelope is too strong to have been produced by normal thermal processes , and that it is probable that this emission is a consequence of processes related to the central star wind .",
    "we note that there is a discrepancy in temperature determinations for the cs of ngc  40 , a wolf - rayet ( wc8 ) , in the literature .",
    "@xcite calls our attention to the peculiarity of the fact that ngc  40 is a low - excitation pn but seems to be excited by a 90,000  k central star . however , a temperature of about 40,000  k , which would be consistent with a low excitation pn , is usually adopted for the ngc  40 central star @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that a `` carbon curtain '' , located around the cs , could be the mechanism responsible for hiding the cs true effective temperature .",
    "a number of works have dealt with the physical parameters and chemistry of ngc  40 in the past decades ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these authors investigated different regions of the nebula utilizing inconsistent slit configurations or apertures , and thus found results that differ greatly from one paper to another . even though these works provide a reliable overall picture of the object , they fail to give more detailed information that could potentially lead to important clues as to shaping mechanisms and enrichment patterns , among others .    one important practical limitation in dealing with spatially resolved data is the fact that all currently - available tools used to estimate the physical and chemical properties of pne have been limited to single numerical values consistent with integrated long - slit fluxes .",
    "an alternative to the above could be to implement scripts written for iraf , which would derive the physical quantities in a pixel per pixel , or region per region fashion , and then to arrange all the results together .",
    "however , these kinds of analyses have rarely been reported .    in this work we present a tool , based on the well established iraf _",
    "nebular _ package ( stsdas.analysis ; de robertis , dufour & hunt 1987 ) , which is capable of working with two - dimensional data , such as ifu and spectroscopic maps .",
    "this tool , the 2d_neb package , has been tested and shown to be consistent with results obtained with _",
    "nebular _ procedures ( see sec .",
    "we also utilize the 2d_neb package to study the pn ngc  40 and present the first spatially resolved results of the spectroscopic mapping of this nebula , for which we have obtained the extinction coefficient , electron density and temperature , and ionic abundances of several elements .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "2 the acquisition and reduction of the data are discussed .",
    "section  3 presents the method of data treatment , including a description of the spectroscopic mapping technique and explanation of those algorithms included in the 2d_neb package that were developed to analyse spectroscopic maps .",
    "some benchmarks of this new package are also given within section  3 . in section",
    "4 the empirical results for one of the long - slits observed in this work are compared with those obtained from the spectroscopic maps by means of the 2d_neb package . section  5 is dedicated to our spatially resolved results for ngc  40 , while the summary and conclusions are in section  6 .",
    "the observational data used in this work includes both an h@xmath4 image and optical long - slit spectra .",
    "the observations were obtained on the night of 2005 october 28@xmath5 , at the 2.56  m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( european northern observatory , la palma , spain ) . for both the image and spectra ,",
    "the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) , which has a pixel scale of 0.189  pixel@xmath6@xmath7 , was used .",
    "the h@xmath4 image has an exposure time of 30  s and the seeing during the exposure was 0.89 . in this paper",
    "this image is used only for comparison with the h@xmath4 spectroscopic map that is constructed using the spectra , as described in detail below .",
    "the reduction of the h@xmath4 image included only bias subtraction , in addition to flat - field ( dome and sky ) correction .",
    "no photometric calibration of this image was performed .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the resolution of the h@xmath4 image is better than the resolution achieved with the maps .    for spectroscopy ,",
    "the long - slit width used was 1.3 .",
    "the alfosc was used with the grism number 7 , which has 600 rules mm@xmath6@xmath7 and a spectral coverage from 3850    to 6850   .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion of the binned pixel is 3.0    pixel@xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "the slit was located on 16 different parallel positions across the nebula .",
    "the distance between them was fixed and set at 3 . for 15 of those positions the exposure times were 3 @xmath8 300  s. for slit b",
    "only one 300  s exposure was taken .",
    "figure  [ imhalpha ] shows our not h@xmath4 image , and also the relative slit positions across the nebula .",
    "note , in addition , that the slits do not cover the entire object .",
    "slit lengths in figure  [ imhalpha ] are reduced for visualization purposes with their respective labels used throughout the text .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the standard procedures for long - slit spectroscopy of the image reduction analysis facility ( ) .",
    "bias frames , flat - field , helium - neon wavelength calibrations and standard star ( g191b2b ) exposures were obtained during the observation runs , and used in the reduction / calibration procedure .",
    "three spectra per slit position were taken to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and eliminate cosmic rays .",
    "the only non - standard procedure used was binning on the dispersion axis .",
    "this was necessary to improve the wavelength ( @xmath9 ) calibration due to the fact that the helium - neon lamp was resolved in the arc frames .    the final calibrated spectrum for slit g , which passes through the central star , is shown in figure  [ slitspectra ] .",
    "fluxes here are representative of the emission integrated along the slit , which we will later call `` wn '' ( whole nebula ) when comparing long - slit measurements and results obtained from the spectroscopic maps , in sections 3.2 and 4 .",
    "emission - line mapping is a technique in which the spatial profiles from a set of parallel slits , for a given emission - line , are combined to create an emission - line map of the nebula @xcite .",
    "we applied this technique using the 16 parallel long - slit spectra described above , to obtain the emission - line maps of ngc  40 .",
    "these maps correspond to a field of view of 120  @xmath8 47  ( see figure  [ hacontour ] ) .",
    "this method has been previously applied to hubble  5 , ngc  6369 , mz  1 and ngc  2022 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , providing informative quantities such as the total emitted flux of each object and variations of density and temperature across the nebulae , among others . for example , @xcite found indication of the presence of a dense ring and of a bipolar structure of lower density for the planetary nebula mz  1 . based on that map",
    ", they proposed a tridimensional hourglass model to represent the gas distribution of the nebula .    in the present paper ,",
    "the above method was applied to generate 31 spectroscopic maps of the pn ngc  40 , each corresponding to a different emission line .",
    "the generated maps were corrected for the effects of field rotation due to the atl - azimuth nature of the telescope as well as for differential atmospheric refraction , using the tables of @xcite . to avoid the presence of pixels with spurious information ,",
    "all created maps have been submitted to a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) cut .",
    "these cuts were done by applying a mask in which all the pixels with a snr lower than a certain value were artificially substituted by 0 ( zero ) . for the brighter emission - lines , the adopted value was snr equal to 7 . on the other hand",
    ", this limit did not work for the weaker emission - lines , as almost no signal would survive to the noise - mask cleaning . to handle this problem ,",
    "noise - masks based on different values were tried .",
    "table  [ mapintens ] presents the list of all the 31 emission - line maps that were constructed , and the correspondent snr cut - offs ( @xmath10 ) of these maps .",
    "the third , fourth and fifth columns of this table show , respectively , the integrated spectroscopic map fluxes ( @xmath11 ) corresponding to the emission of the entire observed nebula , the extinction - corrected intensities ( @xmath12 , as will be discussed in section  5.1 ) , and the number of the figure in which the map is presented in this paper ( fig . ) .",

    "the region with valid pixels in the  map was limited by the noise - mask cleaning of the [ n  ii ]  5755    emission - line map . as the determination of  depends on the electron temperature",
    ", we assumed a constant temperature equal to 9,000  k for the non - valid pixels of the  map .  and",
    "maps are shown in figure [ temden ] . in the  map",
    ", the dashed line indicates the outer limit between the region in which  has been calculated by adopting  =  9,000  k , and the region in which the  map was used .",
    "the mean values of  and  are , respectively , 8,850  k and 1,650  cm@xmath6@xmath20 . comparing with the literature ( table  [ results ] ; columns 10 and 11 ) ,",
    "the mean values we found for  and  are marginally in agreement with previous determinations of the physical properties in ngc  40 .",
    "notice that the  value determined by @xcite ( 2,100  @xmath1 ) is very similar to the values that we found for the nir and sir regions , when we used the data from the slit  g ( and from the  map , at that same region ) . on the other hand",
    ", one can notice that the  map shows great variations , even if we consider the internal region only .",
    "the values found by @xcite ( 1,750  @xmath1 ) and by @xcite ( 1,800  @xmath1 ) approach our mean  map result .",
    "they both used the same line intensities .",
    "the  results from @xcite ( 8,400  k ) and @xcite ( 8,600  k ) again are closer to the mean value of the  map than the one found by @xcite . actually , when we look at the  map , we hardly see any region with values as low as that found by @xcite ( 7,500  k ) , and most of the nebula shows  @xmath22  8,000  k.    it was not possible to calculate the  spectroscopic map due to the very faint emission of [ o  iii ] 4363   . in cases like this , the usual analysis made using a single slit has an advantage since the emission is integrated throughout a region , or throughout the whole nebula , thus the very faint emission - line flux is improved in signal to noise .",
    "this procedure may allow the calculation .",
    "in fact , in the case of ngc  40 , we did derive in two nebular regions ( nir and sir ) using the fluxes of slit  g , as shown in table  [ results ] .     +      and  maps were used to calculate the ionic abundance maps . for the non - valid pixels of these maps we assumed constant values , t@xmath28  =  9,000  k and n@xmath28  =  1,600  @xmath1 . when more than one emission - line was available for determining the ionic abundance of a certain ion , all the strong lines were used , each resulting in an independent ionic abundance map .",
    "then , the ionic abundance map was generated from these individual maps weighted by intensity .",
    "these are the ionic maps shown in figure  [ ionic1 ] and figure  [ ionic2 ] .",
    "the mean values of the ionic abundances are listed in table  [ results ] , in the first column of the map results .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that these mean values were calculated only over the pixels that have survived the noise - mask cleaning .",
    "this means that the abundance maps which have non - valid pixels inside the nebular regions whould have , in reality , lower mean abundances if the entire nebula were considered .    as an attempt to determine the abundances representative of the whole nebula ( wn , in the tables ) for the cases that have non - valid pixels inside the nebular region",
    ", we calculated , for each abundance map , the sum of the ionic abundances of all pixels and divided the result by the number of pixels that compose the nebula ) map is valid , we used the number of valid pixels of the c(h@xmath13 ) map for the number of pixels that compose the nebula ] .",
    "these results represent the lower limits of the corresponding ngc  40 abundances",
    ". these lower limits ( inf.l . )",
    "are also shown in table  [ results ] , column  9 .",
    "+   +   +   +     +   +    the mean ionic abundances determined in this paper can be compared with the results found in the literature , by inspecting table  [ results ] .",
    "for some cases the lower limit ( column 9 ) is closer to the previous ionic determinations .",
    "that is obvious for he@xmath3/h@xmath21  @xmath29 abundance , whose map shows almost no presence of that specie .",
    "the ionic abundances from cl@xmath3/h@xmath21  @xmath30 , cl@xmath3/h@xmath21  @xmath31 , n@xmath21/h@xmath21  @xmath32 , o@xmath3/h@xmath21  @xmath33 , o@xmath3/h@xmath21  @xmath34 , s@xmath21/h@xmath21  @xmath35 and s@xmath21/h@xmath21  @xmath36 show a somewhat different result when compared with the literature .",
    "the discrepancies vary from 70@xmath37 up to a factor of 3 .",
    "these discrepancies can be due to the fact that here , we are analysing a bigger area of the object : the whole nebula , instead of one long slit , as in the case of @xcite , and a set of small portions , in the case of @xcite ) .",
    "notice , for instance , that despite the fact that the mean value of our cl@xmath3/h@xmath21 map ( 3.99  @xmath8  10@xmath38 ) is higher than the mean value from @xcite ( 4.19  @xmath8  10@xmath39 ) and @xcite ( 5.9  @xmath8  10@xmath39 and 7.5  @xmath8  10@xmath39 ) , the inner rim presents a lower cl@xmath3/h@xmath21 abundance when compared to the shell ( see figure  [ ionic1 ] ) .",
    "the result we found for the inner rim is closer to the results from the literature .    examining the ionic distributions of o@xmath25/@xmath21h@xmath21 , n@xmath21/h@xmath21 , s@xmath21/h@xmath21",
    ", he@xmath21/h@xmath21 and that of o@xmath3/h@xmath21 , in figure  [ ionic1 ] and figure  [ ionic2 ] , we see a region ( a diagonal , from left to right , that includes the location of the central star ) in which ionic fractions coming from the low - ionization species ( o@xmath21/h@xmath21 , n@xmath21/h@xmath21 and s@xmath21/h@xmath21 ) are less abundant when contrasted with the neighbor - nebular portions . on the other hand ,",
    "the map of o@xmath3/h@xmath21 and he@xmath21/h@xmath21 show values higher than the average at the same region .",
    "it is worth noticing that , even though he@xmath21/h@xmath21 is a low - ionization specie , a great amount of he@xmath40 is also expected to be present in this low ionization nebula . in spite of the peculiar behaviour of the low - ionization ions , as well as o@xmath3/h@xmath21 and he@xmath21/h@xmath21 , the electron temperature maps ( particularly relevant for abundance determinations ) have no obvious gradient ( see corresponding map in figure  [ temden ] ) that would justify this result .",
    "is this higher ionization tunnel of emission in ngc  40 similar to the jet structures of a number of other nebulae ? in ngc  7009 ,",
    "for instance , two pairs of low - ionization knots are clearly seen , in addition to a pair of jets , in which the excitation degree is significantly higher than that of the immediate vicinity @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to what we find for ngc  40 , in the case of ngc  7009 the electron density of the higher - ionization emission tunnel is a factor of 2 lower than in the other nebular regions .",
    "but note that in both cases the  is roughly the same throughout the nebula .",
    "concerning the element abundances of helium in ngc  40 , he / h , we found the mean value of 7.08  @xmath8  10@xmath41 .",
    "this result has been obtained by summing the he@xmath42 and he@xmath3 ionic abundance maps , and taking its mean value .",
    "this extremely low total helium abundance can be explained by the fact that a significant amount of he@xmath40 is expected to be present in a low excitation nebula like ngc  40 , and he@xmath40 was not considered in the he / h given above . to circumvent this kind of problem",
    ", @xcite suggested that an icf based on the s@xmath42 and s@xmath3 abundances can be used to account for the he@xmath40 abundance of low excitation pne . using our own data we were not able to calculate a s@xmath3 abundance map ,",
    "nevertheless , if we consider the s@xmath3 abundances found by @xcite and @xcite ( table  [ results ] ) , and the mean value of the s@xmath42/h@xmath21 map that we calculated ( 8.88  @xmath8  10@xmath38 , in table  [ results ] ) , we can determine a more reliable value for the he total abundance of ngc  40 . doing this exercise , we find he / h@xmath23=9.32  @xmath8  10@xmath41 , adopting s@xmath3/h@xmath21 from pottasch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and he / h@xmath24=1.18  @xmath8  10@xmath43 by using s@xmath3/h@xmath21 from liu et al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "these three he / h are shown in table  [ results ] .",
    "notice that the interval of s@xmath3 abundances from @xcite and @xcite contains the mean s@xmath3 abundance we found from our slit g , if we consider the ns , nir , sir and ss regions ( again , that is not the case for the wn region , because of the contamination from the central star region ) . and , finally , not only we believe that 9.32  @xmath8  10@xmath41 and 1.18  @xmath8  10@xmath43 should correspond to the lower and upper he abundance limits of ngc  40 , but they are also similar to the previous results found by @xcite , who adopted the same icf scheme to account for the unobserved amount of he@xmath40 in the total helium abundance of ngc  40 .",
    "the total oxygen abundance map is shown in figure  [ abund ] .",
    "this map has been obtained summing the ionic abundance maps of o@xmath25 and o@xmath3 since , unfortunately , o@xmath21 map is not available .",
    "this element abundance is , in fact , only a lower limit .",
    "the corresponding mean value of the o / h map is 4.10  @xmath8  10@xmath44 ; a much lower value when compared with the results from the literature .",
    "that is a consequence of the absence of the o@xmath21 abundance map .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , this ion dominates the oxygen abundance of this nebula .",
    "in this paper we presented a spatially - resolved analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of the planetary nebula ngc  40 . to reach these results ,",
    "16 long - slit parallel optical spectra were obtained , from which we created 31 emission - line spectroscopic maps .",
    "these maps provide the spatially - resolved characteristics of the line emission , and the total fluxes for the whole nebula .    using the usual diagnostic ratios ,",
    "these maps were applied to calculate the 2d density , temperature and abundance information for this nebula . to derive these quantities ,",
    "we adapted the tasks from the well - established iraf _ nebular _",
    "package @xcite , to work with two - dimensional data , thereby developing , and proving the efficiency of , the 2d_neb package .",
    "each emission - line map was corrected for reddening , pixel by pixel , using the c(h@xmath13 ) map that was created from the h@xmath4/h@xmath13 , h@xmath15/h@xmath13 and h@xmath16/h@xmath13 map ratios .",
    "the c(h@xmath13 ) map shows interesting features , with values that vary from less than @xmath00.2 up to more than @xmath00.6 , as shown in the histogram of figure  [ cbeta ] , with a mean characteristic of the whole nebula , c(h@xmath13 ) equal to 0.42 .",
    "the above spatial extinction variation could indicate that dust is mixed with the ionized gas of ngc  40 .",
    "our  map shows only a slight variation from region to region , from @xmath08,000  k up to @xmath09,500  k. on the other hand , these variations are much less prominent than those found in the  map , where the values varies between @xmath01,000  @xmath1 and @xmath03,000  @xmath1 .",
    "the histograms of both physical parameters ,  and , show this dispersion .",
    "the density map also shows that there is a trend to lower density regions on the west side of the nebula , but it does not show any trend for the outer regions compared to the inner ones .",
    "the mean  ( 1,650  @xmath1 ) and  ( 8,850  k ) , from the spectroscopic maps , are in good agreement with other results from the literature @xcite . on the other hand , the maps show spatial variations that were not addressed by previous works .",
    "several of the ionic abundance maps show significant spatial variations .",
    "i ) the ar@xmath45/h@xmath42 and cl@xmath3/h@xmath42 maps show a ring structure on the inner region of ngc  40 , and also high concentrations from these species on the outer region of the nebula .",
    "ii ) the o@xmath40/h@xmath42 e o@xmath3/h@xmath42 maps show strong spatial variations . in the first case ,",
    "the contrast of the regions with o@xmath40/h@xmath42 @xmath46 10@xmath44 is clear .",
    "for the second , most of the nebula has o@xmath3/h@xmath42 between 10@xmath44 and 3@xmath810@xmath44 .",
    "however , regions with lower o@xmath3 abundances are present in the outer regions of the nebula , and regions in which o@xmath3/h@xmath42 varies from @xmath05@xmath810@xmath44 up to @xmath01.3@xmath810@xmath47 are found , primarily between the inner rim and outer shell .",
    "iii ) the he@xmath42/h@xmath42 abundance is also inhomogeneous .",
    "iv ) the n@xmath21/h@xmath42 abundance map shows that almost the whole nebula has an n@xmath21/h@xmath42 between 5@xmath810@xmath44 and 9@xmath810@xmath44 or that n@xmath21/h@xmath42 does not vary significantly throughout the nebula .",
    "v ) finally , the s@xmath21/h map shows clumps , in which the s@xmath21/h varies between less than 4@xmath810@xmath38 up to more than 10@xmath48 .",
    "it is important to point out that maps represent a projection of the nebula along the line of sight on the sky , and so nothing can be said about the tridimensional state of the gas ( t@xmath28 , n@xmath28 , ionic as well as total abundances ) from our analysis of ngc40 .",
    "however , the results obtained in this work allow us to conclude that the spatial variations found in the c(h@xmath13 ) , , , and abundance maps unequivocally confirm the necessity of an analysis with spatial resolution for a more complete study of the physical and chemical properties of planetary nebulae .",
    "furthermore , the spectroscopic mapping technique used in this paper and in previous works shows important advantages when compared with the usual technique that uses one or a few long - slits to analyse the object . as an extra ingredient in this discussion",
    ", we note that @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite did not find significant spatial variation of the chemical abundances when analysing a number of other pne .",
    "as we do find these variations in ngc  40 , an important question that remains to be addressed is : if analysed with the spectroscopic mapping technique , as in this work , would those @xmath020 pne studied with single long - slit spatially resolved spectra ( above references ) show significant chemical variations ?    also in the context of distant extragalactic pne , it is clear that spatially resolved data using techniques similar to the one applied here to study ngc  40 are desirable .",
    "however , our telescopes / instruments prevent us of such a detailed study of distant objects .",
    "fortunately in these situations most of the emission of a pn is captured in a single slit observation making the average values more representative . and , therefore , the interpretation of results for distant extragalactic pne are , at least in a statistical sense , not as seriously affected by the lack of spatial resolution .",
    "we would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of hugo e. schwarz , the observer of the data used here .",
    "we also thank john danziger , the referee , for his revision of the paper with suggestions that helped to improved it .",
    "three brazilian agencies gave us partial support for this work .",
    "so mllf , drg and hm would like to thank capes , faperj s e-26/110.107/2008 grant and fapesp ( 2003/09692 - 0 grant ) , respectively ."
