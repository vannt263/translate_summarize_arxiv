    "since the discovery of high transition - temperature superconductivity in f - doped lafeaso by kamihara _ et al . _ ,  @xcite iron - based superconductors have attracted an enormous interest . while extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been performed so far , the pairing mechanism is yet to be unclear . among various physical properties characterizing the new superconductors ,",
    "the robustness of the superconductivity against impurity doping has been expected to provide a crucial hint to determine the symmetry of the pairing gap function and pin down precisely the glue of the pairing .    up to present , several types of the gap symmetry has been proposed .",
    "@xcite in particular , the @xmath6-wave pairing without sign changes in the brillouin zone and the @xmath7-wave pairing for which electron and hole fermi pockets have opposite sign have been recognized as strong candidates .",
    "experimentally , although some phase - sensitive experiments suggest the existence of sign changes in the gap function ,  @xcite there have been many reports which claim that the pair - breaking effect by impurity doping is rather weak for various impurity dopants .",
    "especially , ni _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and kobayashi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the reduction of the transition temperature is simply determined by the amount of doped carriers , but not by the species of impurity dopants or the details of the local electronic structure around the dopant . while these observations can be understood in terms of the @xmath6-pairing scenario , it is not trivial whether the @xmath7-pairing can also explain the experiments .",
    "indeed , according to theoretical calculations for tight - binding impurity models with the t - matrix approximation  @xcite or the bogoliubov - de genne equation ,  @xcite very small amount of impurities can easily wash out the @xmath7 pairing , especially when the onsite impurity potential is positive . on the other hand , within the same models",
    ", we may still think about the possibility of the @xmath7 pairing when the onsite impurity potential is negative and not so deep .",
    "@xcite thus , quantitative and realistic estimations of the impurity potential are highly desired .",
    "in fact , there have been several _ ab initio _ calculations studying the impurity effects in iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite among them , kemper _ et al .",

    "@xcite however , one of the important aspects of the impurity effect in the iron - based superconductors is their appreciable impurity - species dependence ,  @xcite so that we need a systematic calculation for various dopants .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study systematically local electronic structures of various non - magnetic impurities such as mn , co , ni , zn , and ru , by means of _ ab initio _ density - functional calculations .",
    "@xcite for quantitative characterization of the impurity effect , we derive tight - binding impurity models using maximally - localized wannier orbitals .  @xcite we see that the local electronic structure around the impurity can be classified into three types ; ( i ) for mn , co , and ni , their @xmath0 levels measured from the fe-3@xmath0 level are @xmath1 ev , @xmath2 ev , and @xmath3 ev , respectively , ( ii ) the zn-3@xmath0 level lies very deep ( @xmath9 ev ) , so that the zn site can be regarded as a simple vacancy , and ( iii ) while the level difference between ru-4@xmath0 and fe-3@xmath0 orbitals is quite small as _",

    "supposing that cu is in between ni and zn , the cu substation is expected to have the both effects in the same weight .",
    "( iii ) for analyses of the ru doping , we need careful considerations ; in this system , the transfer modulations are appreciable and a care is required when we solve the impurity model with this transfer modulation .",
    "how it works as pair breaking for superconductivity is an interesting future issue .",
    "finally , we give a remark for the trend in electron correlations .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "estimations for the interaction parameters of lafeaso were done with several techniques .",
    "@xcite basically , the magnitude of the interaction parameters is dominated by two factors ; one is the spatial spread of the wannier orbital and the other is the number of the screening channels .",
    "since the latter is common for all the materials , the wannier - spread difference makes an effective difference in the interaction values .",
    "as far as we see the wannier spread @xmath59 listed in table  [ data_wannier ] , we expect that ( i ) the interactions for mn and co will be close to those for the pure fe system because these elements have similar @xmath59 values , while ( ii ) , as a result of larger spatial spreads of ni and ru than the fe ones , these interactions are smaller than the fe ones ; less correlated .",
    "we have calculated parameters specifying a single - impurity hamiltonian of iron - based superconductors , such as onsite - energy differences between the impurity- and iron-@xmath0 orbitals and transfer modulations , with maximally localized wannier orbitals based on _ ab initio _ density functional calculations .",
    "the onsite - energy difference for mn is positive and those for co and ni are negative , which are basically understood in terms of differences in atomic 3@xmath0 levels of each element .",
    "for the zn case , the impurity @xmath0 levels are no longer near the fermi level , so , in this system , the impurity behaves as a vacancy . for the ru case , while the onsite - level difference is quite small , due to more spatial spread of the ru orbitals than the fe ones , the transfer changes are appreciable and estimated to be @xmath570 mev for the nearest neighbors and @xmath5120 mev for the next neighbors .",
    "we have found that the calculated site occupancy of the impurity is close to a nominal value , so that the impurities apparently do not work as carrier dopants .",
    "nevertheless , an effective doping can occur as a result of a rigid band shift of low - energy electronic structures toward the lower energy side , by a replacement to heavier impurity elements instead of fe .",
    "the origin is understood by the shift of the center of the impurity pdos , leading to the depression of the weight of the impurity states near the fermi level .    finally , we emphasize that the present discussions are based on an assumption that the impurities are non - magnetic .",
    "when we step forward to studies on the correlation effects in the impurity sites , we have to consider the magnetic properties of impurities more seriously .",
    "this point is expected to be important for mn that can have the largest local moment in the 3@xmath0 transition metals , remained as an important future problem .",
