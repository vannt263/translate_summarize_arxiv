    "in classical mechanics , lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations are completely the same description of a dynamical system . usually more attention to the hamiltonian formulation is paid because it has properties of a canonical system .    in post - newtonian",
    "( pn ) mechanics of general relativity , the two formulations are still adopted . are they completely equivalent ?",
    "ten years ago two independent groups [ 1,2 ] answered this question .",
    "they proved the complete physical equivalence of the third - order post - newtonian ( 3pn ) arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) coordinate hamiltonian approach to and the 3pn harmonic coordinate lagrangian approach to the dynamics of spinless compact binaries .",
    "this result was recently extended to the inclusion of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( 4pn ) spin - spin coupling [ 3 ] .    however , there are two different claims on the chaotic behavior of compact binaries with one body spinning and spin effects restricted to spin - orbit ( 1.5pn ) coupling .",
    "that is , the 2pn harmonic coordinate lagrangian dynamics allow the onset of chaos [ 4 ] , but the 2pn adm hamiltonian dynamics are integrable , regular and non - chaotic [ 5,6 ] .",
    "an explanation to the opposite results was given in [ 7 ] .",
    "in fact , the 2pn hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations are not exactly equal but are only approximately related . as its detailed account , the equations of motion for the lagrangian formulation use lower - order terms as approximations to higher - order acceleration terms in the euler - lagrange equations , while these approximations do not occur in the equations of motion for the hamiltonian formulation . it is natural that the lagrangian has approximate constants of motion but the hamiltonian contains exact ones .",
    "these facts were regarded as the essential point for the two formulations having different dynamics . in this sense , the two claims that seem to be explicitly conflicting were thought to be correct .",
    "recently , the authors of [ 8 ] revisited the equivalence between the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations at pn approximations .",
    "they found that the two formulations at the same pn order are nonequivalent in general and have differences .",
    "three simple examples of pn lagrangian formulations , including a relativistic restricted three - body problem with the 1pn contribution from the circular motion of two primary objects , a spinning compact binary system with the newtonian term and the leading - order spin - orbit coupling [ 8 ] and a binary system of the newtonian term and the leading - order spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings [ 9 ] , were used to show that the differences are not mainly due to the lagrangian having the approximate euler - lagrange equations and the approximate constants of motion but come from truncation of higher - order pn terms between the two formulations transformed . an important result from the logic",
    "is that an equivalent hamiltonian of a lower - order lagrangian is usually at an infinite order from a theoretical point of view or at a higher enough order from numerical computations .",
    "based on this , the integrability or non - integrability of the lagrangian can be known by that of the hamiltonian .",
    "more recently , chaos in comparable mass compact binary systems with one body spinning was completely ruled out [ 10 ] .",
    "the reason is that a completely canonical higher - order hamiltonian , which is equivalent to a lower - order conservative lagrangian and holds four integrals of the total energy and the total angular momentum in an eight - dimensional phase space , is typically integrable [ 11 ] .",
    "this result is useful to clarify the doubt on the absence of chaos in the 2pn adm hamiltonian approach [ 5,6 ] and the presence of chaos in the 2pn harmonic coordinate lagrangian formulation [ 4 ] . as a point to illustrate ,",
    "two other doubts about different chaotic indicators resulting in different dynamical behaviours of spinning compact binaries among references [ 12 - 15 ] and different descriptions of chaotic parameter spaces and chaotic regions between two articles [ 4,16 ] have been clarified in [ 17 - 19 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the logic result on the equivalence of the pn hamiltonian and lagrangian approaches at different orders is not easy to check because the exactly equivalent hamiltonian of the lagrangian is generally expressed as an infinite series whose convergence is unknown clearly in most cases . to provide enough evidence for supporting this result , we select a part of the 1pn lagrangian formulation of relativistic circular restricted three - body problem [ 20 ] , where the euler - lagrange equations can be described by a converged taylor series and the equivalent hamiltonian",
    "can also be written as another converged taylor series . for our purpose ,",
    "the hamiltonian is derived from the lagrangian in sect .",
    "2 . then in sect .",
    "3 numerical methods are used to evaluate whether various pn order hamiltonians and the 1pn lagrangian with various pn order euler - lagrange equations are equivalent . finally , the main results are concluded in sect .",
    "as in classical mechanics , a lagrangian formulation @xmath0 and its hamiltonian formulation @xmath1 satisfy the legendre transformation in pn mechanics .",
    "this transformation is written as @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are coordinate and velocity , respectively .",
    "canonical momentum is @xmath5 taking a special pn circular restricted three - body problem as an example , now we derive the hamiltonian from the lagrangian in detail .",
    "the circular restricted three - body problem means the motion of a third body ( i.e. a small particle of negligible mass ) moving around two masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the two masses move in circular , coplanar orbits about their common center of mass , and have a constant separation @xmath9 and the same angular velocity .",
    "they exert a gravitational force on the particle but the third body does not affect the motion of the two massive bodies . taking the unit of mass @xmath10 , we have the two masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the unit of length requires that the constant separation of the two bodies should be unity . the common mean motion , the newtonian angular velocity @xmath13 , of the two primaries is also unity . in these unit systems ,",

    ", we are interested in knowing whether these pn approaches are equivalent .      an eighth- and ninth - order runge  kutta  fehlberg algorithm of variable time - steps is used to solve each of the above euler - lagrange equations @xmath48 and hamiltonians @xmath64 .",

    "let us answer this question .",

    "2(a ) in which the errors of energies of the 1pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath83 and hamiltonian @xmath84 are shown .",
    "it is worth noting that the error of energy is estimated by means of @xmath85 , where @xmath84 is regarded as the energy of @xmath83 at time @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the initial energy .",
    "obviously , the error for @xmath83 is larger in about 10 orders of magnitude than that for @xmath84 .",
    "this result should be very reasonable because differences between @xmath83 and @xmath84 exist explicitly but the canonical equations are exactly given by the 1pn hamiltonian @xmath84 , as shown in the above analytical discussions .",
    "in other words , the difference between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is at 1pn level .",
    "of course , the higher the order @xmath56 gets , the smaller the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath64 becomes .",
    "this is why we can see from figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) that the error of the 8pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath88 and hamiltonian @xmath89 is typically smaller than that of the 1pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath83 and hamiltonian @xmath84 . without doubt , @xmath53 and @xmath65 should be the same in the energy accuracy if no roundoff errors exist in fig .",
    "in addition to evaluating the accuracy of energy integrals of these pn approaches , evaluating the quality of these pn approaches to the euler - lagrange equations @xmath53 or the hamiltonian @xmath65 is also necessary from qualitative and quantitative numerical comparisons . see the following demonstrations for more information .",
    "besides the method of poincar sections , the method of lyapunov exponents is often used to detect chaos from order .",
    "it relates to the description of average exponential deviation of two nearby orbits .",
    "based on the two - particle method [ 28 ] , the largest lyapunov exponent is calculated by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are distances between the two nearby trajectories at times 0 and @xmath86 , respectively . a globally stable orbit is said to be regular if @xmath93 but chaotic if @xmath94 . generally speaking",
    ", it costs a long enough time to obtain a stabilizing value of @xmath95 from the limit . instead , a quicker method to find chaos is a fast lyapunov indicator [ 29,30 ] , defined as @xmath96 the globally stable orbit is chaotic if this indicator increases exponentially with time @xmath97 but ordered if this indicator grows polynomially .",
    "it can be seen clearly from the poincar section of fig .",
    "3(a ) that the dynamics of @xmath53 or @xmath65 in fig .",
    "2(c ) is chaotic .",
    "this result is supported by the lyapunov exponents in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) and the flis in fig .",
    "3(d ) and 3(e ) . what about the dynamics of these various pn approximations ?",
    "the key to this question can be found in figs .",
    "3(b)-3(e ) . here",
    "are the related details . as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , lower order pn approximations to the euler - lagrange equations @xmath53 , such as the 1pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath83 and the 4pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath98 , are so poorer that their dynamics are regular , and are completely unlike the chaotic dynamics of @xmath53 . with increase of the pn order @xmath56 , higher order pn approximations to the euler - lagrange equations",
    "@xmath53 become better and better .",
    "for example , the 8pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath88 allows the onset of chaos , as @xmath53 does .",
    "seen particularly from the evolution curve on the lyapunov exponent and time , the 12pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath99 seems to be very closer to @xmath53 .",
    "these results are also suitable for the pn hamiltonian approximations to the hamiltonian @xmath65 in fig .",
    "when the lyapunov exponents in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) are replaced with the flis in figs .",
    "3(d ) and 3(e ) , similar results can be given .",
    "when the separation @xmath100 is instead of @xmath82 in fig .",
    "3(a ) , an ordered kam torus occurs .",
    "that means that the @xmath53 dynamics is regular and non - chaotic . in figs 3(f)-3(i ) , lower order pn approximations such as @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) have chaotic behaviors , but higher order pn approximations such as @xmath99 ( or @xmath101 ) have regular behaviors .    in short , the above numerical simulations seem to tell us that the euler - lagrange equations ( or the hamiltonian approaches ) at higher enough pn orders have the same dynamics as the euler - lagrange equations @xmath53 ( or the hamiltonian @xmath65 ) .",
    "there is a question of whether these results depend on the separation @xmath9 . to answer it",
    ", we fix the above - mentioned orbit but let @xmath9 begin at 10 and end at 250 in increments of 1 . for each given value of @xmath9 ,",
    "the fli is obtained after integration time @xmath102 . in this way",
    ", we have dependence of flis on the separations @xmath9 in several pn lagrangian and hamiltonian approaches , plotted in fig .",
    "5.5 is referred as a threshold value of fli for distinguishing between the regular and chaotic cases at this time .",
    "that is to say , an orbit is chaotic when its fli is larger than threshold but ordered when its fli is smaller than threshold . in light of this",
    ", we do not find that there are dramatic dynamical differences between the euler - lagrange equations @xmath53 ( or the hamiltonian @xmath65 ) and the various pn approximations such as the 1pn hamiltonian @xmath84 and the 1pn euler - lagrange equations @xmath83 .",
    "however , it is clearly shown in table 1 that regular and chaotic domains of smaller separations @xmath9 in the lowest pn approaches @xmath83 and @xmath84 are explicitly different from those in @xmath53 or @xmath65 . as claimed above",
    ", this result is of course expected .",
    "when the order @xmath56 gets higher and higher , @xmath48 and @xmath64 have smaller and smaller dynamical differences compared with @xmath53 or @xmath65 .",
    "two points are worth noting .",
    "first , the same order pn approaches like @xmath99 and @xmath101 ( but unlike @xmath53 and @xmath65 ) are incompletely equivalent in the dynamical behaviors for smaller values of @xmath9 .",
    "second , all the pn approaches @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath99 , @xmath101 , @xmath103 , @xmath53 and @xmath65 can still have the same dynamics when @xmath9 is larger enough .",
    "the two points are due to the differences among these approaches from the relativistic effects depending on @xmath9 ; smaller values of @xmath9 result in larger relativistic effects but larger values of @xmath9 lead to smaller relativistic effects .",
    "now we are interested in quantitative studies on the various pn approximations @xmath67 to the hamiltonian @xmath65 and the various pn approximations @xmath69 to the euler - lagrange equations @xmath53 . in other words , we want to know how the deviation @xmath104 between the position coordinate @xmath105 for @xmath67 ( or @xmath69 ) and the position coordinate @xmath106 for @xmath65 ( or @xmath53 ) varies with time . to provide some insight into the rule on the deviation with time",
    ", we should consider the regular dynamics in various pn approximations because the chaotic case gives rise to exponentially sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "for the sake of this purpose , the parameters and initial conditions unlike the aforementioned ones are @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath78 .",
