    "in both heavy - quarkonium decays and hard - scattering production , large energy - momentum scales appear .",
    "the heavy - quark mass @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath1 , and , in the case of production , the transverse momentum @xmath2 can be much larger than @xmath1 as well .",
    "thus , the associated values of @xmath3 are much less than one : @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". therefore , one might hope that it would be possible to calculate the rates for heavy quarkonium production and decay accurately in perturbation theory .",
    "however , there are clearly low - momentum , nonperturbative effects associated with the dynamics of the quarkonium bound state that invalidate the direct application of perturbation theory .    in order to make use of perturbative methods , one must first separate the short - distance / high - momentum , perturbative effects from the long - distance / low - momentum , nonperturbative effects  a process which is known as `` factorization . ''",
    "one convenient way to carry out this separation is through the use of the effective field theory nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "nrqcd reproduces full qcd accurately at momentum scales of order @xmath6 and smaller , where @xmath7 is heavy - quark velocity in the bound state in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , with @xmath8 for charmonium and @xmath9 for bottomonium .",
    "virtual processes involving momentum scales of order @xmath0 and larger can affect the lower - momentum processes .",
    "their effects are taken into account through the short - distance coefficients of the operators that appear in the nrqcd action .",
    "because @xmath10 production occurs at momentum scales of order @xmath0 or larger , it manifests itself in nrqcd through contact interactions . as a result",
    ", the quarkonium production cross section can be written as a sum of the products of nrqcd matrix elements and short - distance coefficients : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the quarkonium state , @xmath13 is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory , the @xmath14 are short - distance coefficients , and the @xmath15 are four - fermion operators , whose mass dimensions are @xmath16 . a formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) exists for the inclusive quarkonium annihilation rate @xcite .",
    "the short - distance coefficients @xmath17 are essentially the process - dependent partonic cross sections to make a @xmath10 pair .",
    "the @xmath10 pair can be produced in a color - singlet state or in a color - octet state .",
    "the short - distance coefficients are determined by matching the square of the production amplitude in nrqcd to full qcd . because the @xmath10 production scale is of order @xmath0 or greater ,",
    "this matching can be carried out in perturbation theory .",
    "the four - fermion operators in eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) create a @xmath18 pair , project it onto an intermediate state that consists of a heavy quarkonium plus anything , and then annihilate the @xmath10 pair .",
    "the vacuum matrix element of such an operator is the probability for a @xmath10 pair to form a quarkonium plus anything .",
    "these matrix elements are somewhat analogous to parton fragmentation functions .",
    "they contain all of the nonperturbative physics that is associated with evolution of the @xmath10 pair into a quarkonium state .",
    "both color - singlet and color - octet four - fermion operators appear in eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) .",
    "they correspond , respectively , to the evolution of a @xmath10 pair in a relative color - singlet state or a relative color - octet state into a color - singlet quarkonium .",
    "if we drop all of the color - octet contributions in eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) , then we have the color - singlet model @xcite . in contrast , nrqcd is not a model , but a rigorous consequence of qcd in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the nrqcd decay matrix elements can be calculated in lattice simulations @xcite or determined from phenomenology . however , at present , the production matrix elements must be obtained phenomenologically , as it is not yet known how to formulate the calculation of production matrix elements in lattice simulations . in general , the production matrix elements are different from the decay matrix elements . however , in the color - singlet case , the production and decay matrix elements can be related through the vacuum - saturation approximation , up to corrections of relative order @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "an important property of the matrix elements , which greatly increases the predictive power of nrqcd , is the fact that they are universal , _",
    "i.e. _ , process independent .",
    "nrqcd @xmath7-power - counting rules organize the sum over operators in eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) as an expansion in powers of @xmath7 . through a given order in @xmath7 , only a limited number of operator matrix elements contribute .",
    "furthermore , at leading order in @xmath7 , there are simplifying relations between operator matrix elements , such as the heavy - quark spin symmetry @xcite and the vacuum - saturation approximation @xcite , that reduce the number of independent phenomenological parameters .",
    "in contrast , the cem ignores the hierarchy of matrix elements in the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "the proof of the factorization formula ( [ prod - fact ] ) relies both on nrqcd and on the all - orders perturbative machinery for proving hard - scattering factorization .",
    "a detailed proof does not yet exist , but work is in progress @xcite .",
    "corrections to the hard - scattering part of the factorization are thought to be of order @xmath21 , not @xmath22 , in the unpolarized case and of order @xmath23 , not @xmath24 , in the polarized case .",
    "it is not known if there is a factorization formula at low @xmath2 or for the @xmath2-integrated cross section .",
    "the presence of soft gluons in the quarkonium binding process makes the application of the standard factorization techniques problematic at low @xmath2 .    in the decay case",
    ", the color - octet matrix elements can be interpreted as the probability to find the quarkonium in a fock state consisting of a @xmath10 pair plus some gluons .",
    "it is a common misconception that color - octet production proceeds , like color - octet decay , through a higher fock state .",
    "however , in color - octet production , the gluons that neutralize the color are in the final state , not the initial state .",
    "there _ is _ a higher - fock - state process , but it requires the production of gluons that are nearly collinear to the @xmath10 pair , and it is , therefore , suppressed by additional powers of @xmath7 .    in practical theoretical calculations of the quarkonium production and decay rates , a number of significant uncertainties arise . in many instances , the series in @xmath3 and in @xmath7 of eq .",
    "( [ prod - fact ] ) converge slowly , and the uncertainties from their truncation are large  sometimes of order 100% .",
    "in addition , the matrix elements are often poorly determined , either from phenomenology or lattice measurements , and the important linear combinations of matrix elements vary from process to process , making tests of universality difficult .",
    "there are also large uncertainties in the heavy - quark masses ( approximately 10% for @xmath25 and 5% for @xmath26 , for the mass ranges used in the calculations ) that can be very significant for quarkonium rates proportional to a large power of the mass .      here",
    ", we give a brief review of some of the successes of nrqcd , as well as some of the open questions .",
    "we concentrate on hadroproduction results for both unpolarized and polarized production .",
    "we also discuss briefly some recent two - photon , @xmath27 , and photoproduction results .",
    "using the nrqcd - factorization approach , one can obtain a good fit to the high-@xmath2 cdf data @xcite , while the color - singlet model under predicts the data by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - tevatron ] . )",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the unpolarized tevatron charmonium data has been studied under a number of model assumptions , including lo collinear factorization , parton - shower radiation , @xmath28 smearing , and @xmath28 factorization .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . )",
    "several uncertainties in the theoretical predictions affect the extraction of the nrqcd charmonium - production matrix elements from the data .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the theoretical predictions that arise from the choices of the factorization scale , the renormalization scale , and the parton distributions .",
    "the extracted values of the octet matrix elements are very sensitive to the small-@xmath2 behavior of the cross section and this , in turn , leads to a sensitivity to the behavior of the small-@xmath29 gluon distribution . furthermore , the effects of multiple soft - gluon emission are important , and their omission in the fixed - order perturbative calculations leads to overestimates of the matrix elements .",
    "effects of higher - order corrections in @xmath3 are a further uncertainty in the theoretical predictions .",
    "similar theoretical uncertainties arise in the extraction of the nrqcd production matrix elements for the @xmath30 @xcite states , but , owing to large statistical uncertainties , they are less significant for the fits than in the charmonium case .    at large @xmath2 ( @xmath31 for the @xmath32 ) the dominant quarkonium - production mechanism is gluon fragmentation into a @xmath10 pair in a @xmath33 color - octet state .",
    "the fragmenting gluon is nearly on mass shell and is , therefore , transversely polarized .",
    "furthermore , the velocity - scaling rules predict that the color - octet @xmath10 state retains its transverse polarization as it evolves into @xmath34-wave quarkonium @xcite , up to corrections of relative order @xmath35 .",
    "radiative corrections , color - singlet production , and feeddown from higher states can dilute the quarkonium polarization @xcite . despite this dilution",
    ", a substantial polarization is expected at large @xmath2 .",
    "its detection would be a `` smoking gun '' for the presence of color - octet production .",
    "in contrast , the color - evaporation model predicts no quarkonium polarization .",
    "the cdf measurement of the @xmath32 and @xmath36 polarization as a function of @xmath2 @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pol ] , along with the nrqcd factorization prediction @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath36 polarization is simpler than for the @xmath32 , since feeddown does not play a rle .",
    "however , the statistics are not as good for the @xmath36 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     better determinations of the @xmath30 matrix elements are required in order to make more accurate predictions of the nrqcd @xmath30-production rates at the lhc . as is shown in the @xmath30-polarization analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , some theoretical predictions have quite large uncertainties even at tevatron energies , owing to our poor knowledge of the matrix elements . however , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ lee.fig4 ] , the ratio @xmath37 is still a good measure of the effect of shadowing on @xmath30 production .",
    "the ratio is independent of the @xmath30 state and is quite similar to the @xmath32 ratio in fig .",
    "[ lee.fig2 ]",
    ". the shadowing effect in pb+pb interactions may be somewhat less for the @xmath30 at @xmath38 gev than for the @xmath32 , but the difference is small .",
    "note also , from fig .",
    "[ lee.fig4](b ) , that @xmath37 is essentially independent of the matrix elements and is , therefore , largely unaffected by their uncertainties .",
