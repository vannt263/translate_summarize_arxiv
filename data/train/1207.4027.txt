    "they have appeared in connection to mukai s answer to hilbert s 14-th problem  @xcite,@xcite , have been studied because of their close relationship with homogeneous spaces  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and because of their remarkable combinatorial commutative algebra  @xcite .",
    "the varieties @xmath15 contain a finite distinguished collection of codimension one subvarieties called @xmath3-divisors .",

    "it asks : among all partitions of the @xmath3-divisors on @xmath15 into two sets , what is the largest possible number of pairwise intersections ?",
    "[ dd ]    the purpose of this article is to study the maximum cut problem on the minuscule varieties @xmath15 ( see figure  [ dd ] for a list of minuscule dynkin diagrams ) .",

    "we prove the equality for @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .    in general , determining the maximum cut of a weighted graph is a difficult problem that can not be solved efficiently unless @xmath32 .",
    "a more feasible alternative is to estimate this number via an approximation algorithm with a performance guarantee of @xmath33 .",
    "this is a polynomial time algorithm guaranteed to produce a cut whose weight is at least a known percentage @xmath33 of the maximum cut .",
    "probably the most important instance of a maxcut approximation algorithm is the celebrated goemans and williamson  @xcite stochastic approximation algorithm ( henceforth gw algorithm ) which has a performance guarantee @xmath34 . in this article",
    "we make a detailed analysis of the behavior of the gw algorithm on the graphs @xmath18 and use it as a theoretical tool to derive the above bounds .    to describe the ingredients leading to our results we briefly describe the gw algorithm on a graph @xmath35 ( see section  [ gwalgo ] for details ) . in the first stage the maximum cut problem is relaxed to a semidefinite optimization problem whose solution gives an  optimal \" embedding @xmath36 of the graph in some sphere @xmath37 .",
    "the embedding @xmath38 allows us to associate a cut to every hyperplane @xmath39 in @xmath40 by splitting vertices according to the side of @xmath39 where their image under @xmath38 lies .",
    "it is known that the expected weight of a cut obtained by choosing the hyperplane @xmath39 uniformly at random is at least @xmath41 times the maximum cut .",
    "the second stage of the algorithm consists of uniformly sampling hyperplanes until an above average cut is reached .",
    "our results rely on the following observations ,    1 .",
    "the multigraphs @xmath18 are highly symmetric since they are invariant under the action of the weyl group of the corresponding root system .",
    "such symmetries allow us to choose our optimal embedding to be equivariant .",
    "2 .   the geometry of the varieties provides us with a natural candidate for an equivariant embedding of the graphs @xmath18 in an euclidean space , namely the normalized orthogonal projection of their classes to the orthogonal complement of the canonical class of @xmath15 .",
    "our main result is that this embedding @xmath38 is optimal for the gw semidefinite relaxation .",
    "moreover we also show that this optimal embedding may be thought of as placing the @xmath3-divisors on the vertices of certain coxeter matroid polytopes .",

    "2 .   the canonical bijection between the @xmath3-divisors on minuscule varieties @xmath15 and the weights of the corresponding minuscule representations ( see section  [ geometry ] for details ) . these bijections allow us reduce the necessary calculations to elementary combinatorial identities .",
    "an important quantity in our analysis is the _ performance ratio _ @xmath42 of a graph @xmath35 , defined as the ratio of the expected weight of a random cut divided by the optimal value of the gw semidefinite relaxation ( see section  [ gwalgo ] for detail ) .",
    "this ratio satisfies @xmath43 and is a one dimensional measure of the performance of the algorithm on a graph @xmath35 , increasing as the performance of the algorithm improves . in this article",
    "we also study how symmetry affects this quantity .",
    "we derive formulas for the performance ratio on doubly transitive graphs and are able to analyze its behavior for large classes of strongly regular graphs ( see section  [ gwsymmetry ] for precise statements ) .",
    "our main result in this direction is the following    for an integer @xmath44 let @xmath45 be the collection of doubly transitive strongly regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue @xmath46 .",
    "the essential performance ratio @xmath47 equals one , where @xmath48    the above theorem says that the performance of the goemans - williamson algorithm improves as the size of the graphs under analysis increases approaching its theoretically possible maximum .",
    "these results can be thought of as the flip - side of worst - case performance analysis . we are no longer interested in determining the worst - case performance of an algorithm but instead we want to characterize rich classes of graphs where performance is provably better than expected .",
    "these results are especially interesting in the case of the goemans williamson algorithm since it is known  @xcite that either @xmath49 is the best possible performance ratio of a certified approximation algorithm to the maximum cut problem or the unique games conjecture does not hold .",
    "a possible strategy to look for counterexamples is to find classes of graphs where the performance ratio is provably better than @xmath49 .",

    "a viable alternative is to use a polynomial time certified approximation algorithm such as the goemans williamson algorithm , described in the next section .",

    "goemans and williamson introduced in  @xcite a certified stochastic approximation algorithm for the maximum cut problem .",
    "the algorithm proceeds in two stages : first , it introduces a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem ( which can be solved in polynomial time ) and then a random rounding procedure which allows us to produce cuts whose weight is guaranteed to be at least @xmath78 of the maximum cut of @xmath35 .",
    "we describe these two steps in greater detail ,    1 .",
    "semidefinite relaxation : the maximum cut problem on a multigraph @xmath79 can be stated as a quadratic integer optimization problem .",

    "more generally , for an assignment @xmath87 we define @xmath88 and letting @xmath38 run over all assignments of vertices to vectors in some sphere we have @xmath89 where the inequality occurs since the set of assignments includes the integral assignments @xmath90 and the equality because a symmetric matrix @xmath91 is positive semidefinite iff it admits a cholesky factorization . the determination of the rightmost quantity is a semidefinite optimization problem and",
    "thus can be solved in polynomial time  @xcite .",
    "2 .    randomized rounding : for any assignment @xmath92 and any hyperplane @xmath93 we can produce a cut @xmath94 by letting @xmath95 goemans and williamson study the weights of cuts produced by hyperplanes chosen uniformly at random in the dual unit sphere .",
    "they compute the expected value of the random weight @xmath96 of cuts produced in this manner and relate it with the value of @xmath97 ( see  @xcite[theorems 2.1,2.3 ] for details ) , @xmath98:=\\mathbb{e}\\left(w(s(h),s(h)^c)\\right ) = \\sum_{i < j } \\frac{\\arccos(f(i)\\cdot f(j))}{\\pi } \\geq \\alpha { \\operatorname{sd}}(f)\\ ] ] where @xmath99 if @xmath100 is an optimal embedding then @xmath101 and thus the above randomized rounding procedure yields cuts whose weight is at least @xmath102 of @xmath103 .",
