    "a general model , able to explain the thermal conductivity @xmath0 in macro- , micro- and nanostructured systems is still an open challenge .",
    "experimental measurements on low - dimensional semiconductors @xcite have shown a drastic size - dependent reduction of @xmath0 as compared to bulk values.@xcite a great effort has been devoted in the last years to develop a general model which provides an accurate understanding of this reduction.@xcite at present , we can confirm that , when the size of the samples is reduced , classical boundary effects are expected due to the existence of a surface or an interface . below some nanometers",
    "phonon confinement may also influence thermal transport through the modification of the dispersion relations .",
    "however , it is still under debate which are the most important effects at the different length scales since most of the proposed models do not agree even in the origin of the reduction of the thermal conductivity , whether it is due to a change in the relaxation times , a confinement or a quantum effect , especially within the range of @xmath1 nanometers . in order to obtain a thermal transport model valid at all ranges of sizes and temperatures ,",
    "it is necessary to have some certainty about the limits of applicability of the classical approaches without the inclusion of the mentioned changes and the size dimensions where those are strictly necessary .",
    "recent works have focused their attention on the calculation of phonon scattering rates by _ ab initio _ techniques.@xcite these works suggest that the main reason for the poor adjustment of current theories arises from the use of empirical potentials with adjustable parameters or the use of classical expressions for the relaxation times .",
    "based on _ ab initio _ techniques , they solve numerically the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) to obtain the scattering times and predict the thermal conductivity . in the last years",
    ", the thermal conductivity of several materials has been calculated ( see ref . and references therein ) . in these works ,",
    "the theoretical predictions agree very well with the experiment in particular intervals of sizes and temperatures .",
    "very recently , fugallo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , also using _ ab initio _ techniques , calculate the thermal conductivity of bulk diamond and isotopically enriched diamond by solving the bte using the variational principle and the conjugate gradient scheme .",
    "they introduced the scattering due to boundary effects with a shape factor to fit the low temperature region .",
    "the mathiessen rule is used in both cases to account for the different scattering mechanisms .    in spite of these advances , the models based on _ ab initio _ techniques",
    "looses some of the thermodynamics involved in the heat transport mechanisms , hidden behind the numerical complexity of the models . at this stage ,",
    "a phenomenological model is always desirable when the physical processes can be clearly described .",
    "this perspective also aimed the work by allen@xcite , where the widely used callaway model@xcite is improved by a more rigorous treatment of phonon - phonon scattering , paying particular attention to the introduction of the normal scattering relaxation time into the expression of the lattice thermal conductivity .    in the last decade",
    ", some authors have suggested that in order to predice nanoscale transport parameters , memory and nonlocalities had to be included @xcite in the expressions . in this line of thought , here we demonstrate that some issues appearing when fitting thermal conductivity data are not related to the particular expression used for the relaxation times but with the way their thermodynamic averages are calculated .",
    "we show , from an approach based on guyer and krumhansl model , @xcite that a more appropriate equation for @xmath0 can be obtained",
    ". this equation will provide a new insight into the underlying physics of thermal transport .",

    "our proposal is in good agreement with experimental data on bulk silicon,@xcite thin films ( tfs),@xcite and nanowires ( nws),@xcite with characteristic sizes above 30 nm .",
    "we show that confinement or quantum effects are not necessary to understand the lattice thermal transport above these sizes and that the difficulty of prediction at the nanoscale seems to be deeply related to the thermodynamic treatment of phonon - phonon interactions . at the same time",
    ", this allows to establish a lower limit for classical models , where bulk properties are enough to understand the phenomenology . only below this limit , of",
    "the order of a few tens of nanometers , confinement effects may play a role.@xcite",
    "bte is the usual starting point in all thermal conductivity works .",
    "its mathematical form and the physical interpretation of its terms in thermal transport applications have been widely discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "summarizing , when a small temperature difference @xmath2 is applied on a system , the phonon distribution @xmath3 moves from equilibrium at a linear rate . on the other hand , collisions turn the phonon distribution back to equilibrium at a rate that depends on the scattering transition rate .",
    "the bte allows to obtain the resulting phonon distribution function by relating both rates @xmath4 unfortunately , the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ boltz_0 ] ) is unknown .",
    "two possible alternatives are : i ) to solve the full equation numerically or ii ) to derive some simplified expression replacing part of eq .",
    "( [ boltz_0 ] ) and solve it analytically .",
    "the computational power nowadays allows the numerical solution of the bte in combination with density functional theory obtaining remarkable results in particular regions of temperature .",
    "specifically , for silicon , comparison with natural and isotopically enriched bulk samples has been obtained in the [ 50 - 350 ] k range @xcite , but for low temperatures , the grid of @xmath5 points needed in this approach is out of the calculational capability @xcite . in order to improve this , fugallo et al .",
    "@xcite combined _ ab initio _ with a phenomenological expression with a fitting parameter for the boundary scattering for bulk diamond . in reduced size samples , predictions for wires have not been able to be compared with experiments since , in words of the authors , they provide larger values of @xmath0 @xcite . to date",
    "this kind of approach has not been able to obtain a single solution valid at all ranges of temperatures and sample sizes for this material , demonstrating that phenomenological approaches are still necessary .",
    "here we develop an approach that allows to distinguish between two different regimes and shows that the difficulty for obtaining a global solution lies in the fact that each regime happens at different temperature intervals . in this section",
    "we define the terms that will be used in our model to obtain the final expression of the thermal conductivity .    in equilibrium it can be easily demonstrated that phonons follow the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy of the phonon mode ( @xmath8,@xmath9 ) ( the branch @xmath8 will be omitted for simplicity ) , @xmath10 the absolute temperature and @xmath11 the boltzmann constant .",
    "if a temperature difference is applied on the system @xmath2 , an asymmetry in @xmath3 will be generated in the direction of the resulting gradient @xmath12 .",
    "in general , the final form of the distribution can be very complex , but under small @xmath2 the deviations from equilibrium are expected to be small . in that case , we can expand @xmath3 and keep the first term in the expansion : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a smooth function of the energy and temperature whose precise form depends on the scattering processes .",
    "expressed in these terms , solving bte is reduced to obtain an expression for @xmath14 , which will lead to a thermal conductivity equation .",
    "the approach used to solve the problem will depend ultimately on the expected form of @xmath14 .",
    "there are roughly two main approaches to solve bte analytically : the kinetic methods ( km ) and the variational methods ( vm ) .",
    "km can be applied when the distribution function is expected to be very close to equilibrium . in this case , the collision term is usually simplified by assuming that it is proportional to the inverse of a relaxation time ( relaxation time approximation ( rta ) ) , depending only on the values of a single mode . finding relaxation times for reduced regions of temperature and size is not difficult .",
    "the problem appears if one wants to extend the region of applicability to wider intervals using the same km approach with the same rta expression . in the last decades",
    ", the miniaturization has worsened this situation , showing dramatic divergences between km - rta predictions and the experimental results when bulk and nanoscale samples are simulated with the same relaxation time expressions .",
    "in contrast , when the system is not so close to equilibrium , vm provides a better way to solve bte . in general the collision terms in vm can not be expressed analytically , instead they have to be obtained by integration using a trial function .",
    "this trial function should be close to the actual solution to have a good convergence .",
    "the main drawback is that this function is not necessarily the same in all temperature ranges . in conclusion , this approach is only useful in regions where the form of the phonon distribution is known to some extent .",
    "although thermal conductivity obtained within the km and vm seem to be disconnected , from thermodynamic reasoning we will demonstrate that both can be derived from the balance of entropy production .",
    "the main difference between both approaches resides in the way this balance is performed . starting from this point , it is easy to demonstrate that a general expression for thermal conductivity can be obtained by combining the distribution function in these two extreme situations : the first one where resistive processes are dominant and equilibrium can be rapidly achieved ( related to km ) and the second one where although equilibrium can not be easily reached , conservation of momentum in collisions allows us to determine analytically the scattering term ( related to vm ) .    to obtain @xmath0 in each limit , an expression for the scattering term in eq .",
    "( [ boltz_0 ] ) is needed . in km",
    "this is usually done by the rta approach , but in vm the expected form of the distribution function do not provide a simple expression . in the particular case",
    "when normal collisions are dominant , we suggest that the same rta expression can be used , leaving the difference between approaches only in the way to perform the thermodynamic averages with this relaxation times .      as indicated before , the expected form of @xmath14 will determine the choice between a km or a vm approach .",
    "the calculation of the scattering rates depends on it and , at the same time this depends on which scattering mechanism is dominating the system . determining the dominating mechanism is thus the first important question to solve .",
    "phonons can relax by different mechanisms , colliding with boundaries , impurities , electrons and between them .",
    "all these mechanisms are resistive except some part of the phonon - phonon collisions .",
    "two phonons with wave number and energy @xmath15 and @xmath16 can scatter and produce , as a result , a new phonon @xmath17 ( or vice - versa ) . in all events ,",
    "energy must be conserved , but the wave number or quasi - momentum can be lost due to the interaction with the whole lattice .",
    "the equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a reciprocal lattice vector , expresses the fact that the total lattice can acquire an amount of momentum @xmath19 because the resultant phonon is reflected outside of the first brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite if the quasi - momentum is conserved ( @xmath20 ) the scattering processes are called normal or n - processes , while in the general case ( @xmath21 ) they are called umklapp or u - processes . regarding the dominance of the n - processes two limiting behaviors can be considered :    \\i ) when resistive collisions are dominant and n - processes are negligible , momentum will be completely dissipated and its average value is zero .",
    "the only way to move the phonon distribution from equilibrium is by changing its temperature . in that case , the distribution function takes the form @xmath22 comparing with eq . ( [ aprox_non_eq_dist ] ) an expression for @xmath23 can be obtained @xmath24 in this situation km is the most suitable approach to use .",
    "\\ii ) when n - processes are dominant , the system will not be able to relax the momentum to zero ( the quasi - momentum is conserved ) and a displacement @xmath25 of the distribution function in the direction of the thermal gradient is expected .",
    "the distribution function takes the form @xcite @xmath26 which is in a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "then , @xmath14 takes the form @xmath27 in this case the vm approach must be used .    summing up ,",
    "( [ phi_for_rta ] ) and ( [ phi_for_vm ] ) are the two forms of @xmath23 expected for the distribution function in each approach , km and vm respectively , corresponding to two extreme situations described above .",
    "next , we will use both expressions of @xmath23 to show that in some situations , they yield equivalent expressions for the relaxation times .",
    "once we have determined both expressions for @xmath14 in the two limiting cases , we can use them to determine the collision term in eq .",
    "( [ boltz_0 ] ) in each case .",
    "this depends on the transition probabilities and the form of the distribution functions . in general , the collision term in the boltzmann equation can be written , for elastic scattering , as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the scattering transition rates from mode @xmath9 to @xmath30 when the distribution functions correspond to equilibrium .",
    "the integral ( [ collision_1 ] ) is expressing the fact that relaxation process in an out of equilibrium is modified by terms @xmath31 , _",
    "i. e. _ depending on the displacement with respect to equilibrium of the different colliding particles . expression ( [ collision_1 ] ) can be generalized for an arbitrary number of colliding particles :    @xmath32 p_{\\bm{q}\\bm{q}_{1} ...",
    "\\bm{q}_{n}}^{\\bm{q}'_{1} .. \\bm{q}'_{m } } \\prod_{i=1\\atop j=1}^{m\\atop n } d\\bm{q}_{i } d\\bm{q}'_{j}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 collides with @xmath33 giving as a result the modes @xmath34 .",
    "expression ( [ collision_2 ] ) shows the main complexity of solving the bte equation .",
    "the scattering term requires the actual distribution function inside an integral expression establishing bte as an integro - differential equation .",
    "one can use a numerical approach to solve it but other approximations can also be employed .",
    "these are usually based in the fact that the distribution used in the integral does not modify significantly the final result in some limiting situations . in rta we assume that the system is close enough to equilibrium that the differences between using the actual form of the distribution or the equilibrium form in the collision integral ( [ collision_2 ] ) is not significant.this is like saying that the only mode out of equilibrium is the one with wave number @xmath9 and that the remaining modes rest in equilibrium .",
    "thus @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this case , @xmath38 if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ aprox_non_eq_dist ] ) in ( [ collision_3 ] ) we have @xmath39    thus , we can define the relaxation time @xmath40 of mode @xmath9 as @xmath41 and so , we obtain the bte solution in the well known rta approach @xmath42    we can make a similar assumption when normal scattering is the dominant relaxation process .",
    "the only change is that the distribution function where the actual distribution function will relax is that of eqs .",
    "( [ dist_vm])-([phi_for_vm ] ) . in that case ,",
    "condition ( [ condition_1 ] ) can not be fulfilled locally by each mode , but it can be demonstrated that in the linear regime not much error is made in eq .",
    "( [ collision_2])@xcite if we consider that @xmath43 this condition leads to the same result as that obtained near equilibrium ( [ collision_4])-([collision_5 ] ) , since condition ( [ collision_6 ] ) is equivalent to condition ( [ condition_1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can use the same expression for the scattering rates in both limiting situations , near equilibrium and in non - equilibrium , despite of the very different nature of the two situations . note that by using eqs .",
    "( [ dist_rta])-([phi_for_rta ] ) and ( [ dist_vm])-([phi_for_vm ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ collision_6 ] ) we are not stating that resistive processes are suppressed .",
    "in fact @xmath44 are the transition rates for all the resistive scattering processes .",
    "we are only considering that collision integral ( [ collision_6 ] ) does not change significantly when one uses the actual form of the distribution function or the proposed approximations in the corresponding regimes .",
    "in rta in the special case when all the resistive terms are absolutely negligible , either km and vm expression will give an infinite thermal conductivity as expected .",
    "in the following section we apply this result to obtain an expression for the thermal conductivity under each situation in the case where non - negligible resistive terms are present .",
    "the approximations here proposed will allow us to calculate two well differentiate regimes of behavior in the thermal transport : the kinetic and the collective regime .",
    "here we propose to derive thermal conductivity from the balance of entropy as obtained by ziman@xcite .",
    "the reason for this choice lies in the nature of normal scattering .",
    "entropy generation is related to resistive collisions and normal scattering is not resistive .",
    "it is logical to think that entropy production can be modified when these kind of collisions are dominant . in this section",
    "we analyze these differences .    in this deduction thermal conductivity",
    "is obtained from the equality of entropy production calculated from the drift and the collision terms in eq .",
    "( [ boltz_0 ] ) .",
    "the collision term is obtained under a microscopic formalism , and the drift term is expressed in thermodynamic variables .    the key point to notice",
    "is that n - processes , despite of being non - resistive , mix the different modes , affecting the balance between drift and collisions .",
    "if n - processes are not important and mode mixing is low , entropy balance should be fulfilled individually by each mode , that is , locally in momentum space .",
    "this leads to the thermal conductivity in the _",
    "kinetic regime_. on the other hand , when mode mixing is high ( n - processes dominate ) the entropy balance should be achieved globally , in this case we obtain the thermal conductivity in the _ collective regime_. depending on the intensity of the normal collisions we should select the local or the global version for the entropy production balance .",
    "next , we detail both regimes of behavior and obtain the corresponding thermal conductivity contribution .",
    "+      entropy of a distribution of bosons is @xmath45 the variation of entropy can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ aprox_non_eq_dist ] ) .",
    "if we take only linear terms in @xmath14 this can be written as @xcite @xmath46 thermodynamically , the entropy variation can be also written in terms of the heat flux @xmath47 where the heat flux of mode @xmath48 is @xmath49 and we have used the fact that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the thermal conductivity of mode @xmath9 , and @xmath52 is the group velocity .",
    "equating ( [ entropy_drift_def ] ) and ( [ entropy_production_local ] ) leads to an expression giving the thermal conductivity of each mode @xmath53 integrating ( [ conductivity_mode_kin ] ) over all modes yields total thermal conductivity in this kinetic regime @xmath54 and if we substitute eq .",

    "the balance of entropy should be achieved globally and integration should be performed before equating terms .",
    "thus , the total entropy production is on one side @xmath56 and on the other we must account for a total heat flux , giving @xmath57 using the fourier s law @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 being @xmath0 the global thermal conductivity achieved in this regime .",
    "we denote it as @xmath60 and we obtain its expression by equating ( [ entropy_global_scat ] ) and ( [ entropy_global_drift ] ) @xmath61 where the total heat flux is @xmath62    by substituting this expression in eq .",

    "after deducing the expression of the thermal conductivity in each regime , we need to choose a magnitude able to determine if we are in the local or global behavior . secondly in order to calculate the integrals in ( [ conductivity_kin ] ) and ( [ conductivity_global2 ] ) , we need some expressions for the collision terms .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "we are now able to calculate the thermal conductivity from eq .",
    "( [ conductivity_kin ] ) for the kinetic regime and from eq .",

    "( [ conductivity_kin ] ) , @xmath64 can be rewritten as @xmath65 which is the classical km expression for the thermal conductivity . here and onward we have omitted the index for the phonon branch in the integrals for the shake of simplicity .    for ( [ conductivity_global2 ] ) , one can make the same substitutions to obtain @xmath66    @xmath64 and @xmath60 can be re - expressed in terms of frequency to simplify the integration in isotropic materials .",
    "this is done by the substitution @xmath67 , being @xmath68 the density of states ( dos ) , and integrating the angular part . for the kinetic regime",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath69 where now the frequency dependence is indicated with the subindex ( in the group velocity the subindex is omitted for simplicity ) , and for the collective regime @xmath70 where we have used the explicit form ( [ phi_for_vm ] ) to express @xmath14 in terms of the wave vector @xmath71 .",
    "the only question to be addressed in eq .",
    "( [ conductivity_coll_dos ] ) is that in order to maintain isotropy , @xmath72 should be a frequency averaged value .",
    "this does not lead to large variations in isotropic materials .",
    "as we have already pointed , in both expression ( [ conductivity_kin_dos ] ) and ( [ conductivity_coll_dos ] ) @xmath73 is the same and accounts for the total relaxation time contributing to thermal resistance .",
    "then , we denominate it @xmath74 . finally , we need a magnitude which accounts for the kind of regime the phonon distribution is undergoing at the different temperatures .",
    "as we have commented , this is determined by the degree of mixing between modes .",
    "since this is related to the dominance of normal with respect to resistive processes , a switching factor weighting the relative importance of these processes should be used .",
    "this factor can be calculated from a matrix representation@xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the relaxation time due to n - processes and @xmath77 is the relaxation time due to resistive processes . both relaxation times @xmath76 and @xmath77 are averaged over all modes .",
    "this is calculated as @xmath78 with subindex @xmath79 indicating @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "the general expression of the thermal conductivity must include this switching factor to account for all the intermediate regimes between the limiting regimes , _",
    "e_. from kinetic to collective regime .",

    "different phenomenological behavior can be deduced from the mathematical difference in performing the averages in ( [ conductivity_kin_dos ] ) and ( [ conductivity_coll_dos ] ) .",
    "this differences are equivalent to add resistivities in serial or parallel , if we interpret the scattering events on a particular mode as a resistance .",
    "this can give physical insight in order to interpret the thermal conductivity behavior in the different regimes .",
    "( [ kappa_tot ] ) it can be deduced why all models based on a single approach ( km or vm ) fail when extended to a global model in a large range of temperatures . in this extension",
    "they are used in an approximation where they are not supposed to be valid . with this eq .",
    "( [ kappa_tot ] ) , the behavior change is included in the model , extending its applicability to the whole temperature range .",
    "another remarkable difference is the way to include size effects in both expressions .",
    "this is discussed on the next section .      in an infinite semiconductor sample at near room temperature one can consider that only impurities scattering and umklapp scattering participate significantly , then by means of the mathiessen s rule @xmath89    relaxation times allow to calculate a related term , the phonon mean free path @xmath90 , that is the product between the relaxation time of a mode and its group velocity @xmath91 .",
    "if the dimension of the system is finite and the temperature is low , intrinsic mean free paths can be larger than the size of the system . in this case ,",
    "boundary effects need to be included .    in the kinetic regime of the thermal conductivity ,",
    "as the phonons behave individually , each mode could experience independently a scattering with the boundary .",
    "then , an extra term considering this effect should be included in the kinetic term of eq .",
    "( [ kappa_tot ] ) by using the mathiessen s rule in combination with the intrinsic events , this is @xmath92 the relaxation time due to boundary scattering @xmath93    however , in the collective term some caution has to be taken . in this regime",
    "a scattering rate is a quantity describing the distribution globally .",
    "in other words , one can not assume an extra scattering term in each mode independently because the boundary is noticed by the whole phonon collectivity .",
    "thermodynamically , this is the same situation as flow on a pipe .",
    "carriers in the center of the pipe notice the boundary not by themselves but through the collisions with the rest of the particles .",
    "the net effect on the flow is the reduction of the flow on the surface .",
    "the usual solution for this situation is to assume that the flow on the surface is zero .",
