    "thanks to their characteristic period - luminosity ( pl ) and period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations , classical cepheids are the most important stellar standard candles to estimate accurate distances within the local group , reaching @xmath0 30 mpc from space observations .",
    "these cepheid based distances provide an absolute calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and two hst projects have been devoted to this issue , obtaining an estimate of the hubble constant ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , cepheid properties are very important tools to investigate the physics and the evolutionary behaviour of intermediate mass stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "even if the cepheid pl and plc relations are traditionally studied in the standard johnson - cousin bvrijk magnitude system , the broadband filters employed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are becoming more and more popular in the context of current and future projects .",
    "for example , observations with the vlt survey telescope ( vst ) , the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , the pan - starrs1 survey ( kaiser 2004 ) , the dark energy survey2 ( des ; abbott et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the large synoptic survey telescope3 ( lsst ; tyson 2002 ) are being done in the sloan filters and from programs including a time - domain component , a large number of variable stars , including cepheids , is expected . in particular ,",
    "we are deeply involved in the inaf - gto approved vst survey step ( smc in time - evolution of a prototype interacting late - type dwarf galaxy ; pi : v. ripepi , * ? ? ? * ) )",
    ". this project will include @xmath4 and @xmath5 time - series photometry of the bridge , connecting the two magellanic clouds , in order to study its stellar populations using the variable stars as tracers .",
    "thanks to approved and submitted eso proposal we plan to obtain 20 - 25 phase points in @xmath4 and @xmath5 on 32 squared degrees to identify and study variables including both classical cepheids and rr lyrae . periods and mean @xmath4 and @xmath5 magnitudes will be obtained from these data and accurate pl and plc relations will be derived .",
    "+ in order to guarantee a reliable interpretation of these and other cepheid data and to assure a comparison between theory and observations , in this paper we provide a theoretical scenario to interpret the properties of classical cepheids in the sdss filters , for the characteristic chemical composition shown by these pulsators in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "+ the organization of the paper is the following . in section [ puls ]",
    "we present the nonlinear convective pulsation models developed by our team , whereas in section [ sdss ] the adopted model atmospheres to transform the theoretical quantities and the bolometric light curves into the sdss filters are discussed . the results are shown in section [ puls_sdss ] and in section [ comp ] we present the comparison between model predictions and previous results available in the literature . the conclusions close the paper .",
    "the adopted nonlinear convective pulsation models are taken from @xcite for the chemical compositions representative of galactic and magellanic cepheids , namely @xmath60.02 , @xmath70.28 ( milky way ) , @xmath60.008 , @xmath70.25 ( lmc ) and @xmath60.004 , @xmath70.25 ( smc ) .",
    "for each selected stellar mass in the range from 3.5 @xmath8 to 11 @xmath8 a luminosity level based on an evolutionary mass - luminosity relations that neglects both core overshooting and mass loss ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "previous theoretical investigation has shown that the inclusion of mild overshooting ( corresponding to an increase in the intrinsic luminosity of 0.25 dex , at fixed mass , according to chiosi , wood and capitanio 1993 ) implies a decrease of about 0.2 mag in the distance moduls inferred from theoretical wesenheit and plc relations ( see e.g. caputo , marconi , musella 2000 ) . + the properties of adopted pulsation models are summarized in table 1 .",
    "for each combination of chemical composition , mass and luminosity , a wide range of effective temperatures has been explored to define the position of the instability strip boundaries for both the fundamental and the first overtone mode .",
    ".parameters of the computed pulsational models adopted in this paper.the last four columns are the temperatures in kelvin of the first overtone blue edge ( fobe ) , the fundamental blue edge ( fbe ) , the first overtone red edge ( fore ) and the fundamental red edge ( fre ) respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in a recent paper , @xcite have derived semiempirical cepheid pl relations in the sdss magnitudes by combining observed lmc bvi mean magnitudes with theoretical bolometric corrections . in the same paper",
    "these authors construct empirical @xmath9,@xmath10 pl relations , using the publicly available johnson - sloan photometric transformations , finding a good agreement with the semiempirical ones .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the comparison between the pl slopes derived in this paper for fundamental models with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( filled symbols ) and the semiempirical ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open symbols ) for the @xmath13 filters . in the case of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "the empirical relations by the same authors ( asterisks ) are also shown .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the slope of the pl relations obtained in this paper , using suitable pulsation and atmosphere models , for periods shorter than 100 d , are systematically steeper than the semiempirical and empirical ones presented by @xcite , with a deviation decreasing from @xmath0 13 @xmath1 in the @xmath2 filter to @xmath14 in the @xmath3 filter .",
    "in this paper we have provided the first theoretical scenario to our knowledge for the interpretation of classical cepheid properties observed in the sdss filters .",
    "extensive and detailed sets of nonlinear convective pulsation models computed for the typical chemical compositions of galactic and magellanic pulsators have been transformed into the sdss filters by using bolometric corrections and color - temperature transformations based on updated model atmospheres .",
    "the main results of this investigation can be summarized as follows :    * the transformed instability strip confirms the nonlinearity of the fundamental boundaries and the dependence on the metal content already found in the johnson - cousins bands .",
    "this behaviour explains why pl relations are not linear at large periods . *",
    "the pl relations in the sdss filters show evidence of the break at 10 days , in particular for the lower metal contents and the shorter wavelengths , as expected on the basis of previous empirical and theoretical studies . * the theoretical light curves in the sdss filters present morphological characteristics similar to the ones in the johnson - cousins bands , with evidence of the hertzprung - progression phenomenon at the expected period for each selected chemical composition . *",
    "the derived wesenheit and plc relations have , as expected , a smaller intrinsic dispersion than pl relations and show a metallicity dependence that resembles the behaviour of their johnson - cousins counterparts . *",
    "the obtained relations for first overtone pulsators are all linear and much less affected by metallicity than the fundamental mode ones . *",
    "a comparison between the relations obtained in this paper and the semiempirical and empirical ones obtained by @xcite indicates a discrepancy in the slopes ranging from @xmath0 13 @xmath1 in @xmath2 to @xmath14 in @xmath3 , with the theoretical relations being systematically steeper ."
