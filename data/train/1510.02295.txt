    "during the recent years , several constructions of @xmath0-equivariant flat toric degenerations of flag varieties and spherical varieties have been presented . to name a few examples : there is the approach of caldero @xcite and alexeev - brion @xcite , which uses certain nice properties of the multiplicative behavior of the dual canonical basis , there is the approach of kaveh @xcite and kiritchenko @xcite , which has been inspired by the theory of newton - okounkov bodies @xcite , and there is the approach in @xcite , which has been inspired by a conjecture of vinberg concerning certain filtrations of the enveloping algebra of @xmath7 .",
    "the starting point for this article was the aim to understand the connection between @xcite and @xcite ( see example  [ kiritchenkoexample ] ) .    to be more precise , let us fix some notations .",
    "in the following let @xmath8 be a complex connected reductive algebraic group , we assume that @xmath9 , where the semisimple part @xmath10 of @xmath8 is simply connected .",
    "we fix a cartan decomposition @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a maximal torus and @xmath13 is a borel subalgebra of @xmath14 . correspondingly let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the maximal unipotent subgroups of @xmath8 having @xmath17 respectively @xmath18 as lie algebra , and let @xmath0 be a maximal torus in @xmath8 with lie algebra @xmath12 and weight lattice @xmath19",
    ". denote by @xmath20 the subset of dominant weights .",
    "the aim of the present article is to exhibit an approach which , in a certain way , unifies the three approaches mentioned above . let @xmath21 be the number of positive roots of @xmath8 . as a first step , we fix a sequence @xmath22 of positive roots ( they do not have to be pairwise different ! ) .",
    "we call the sequence a _ birational sequence _ for @xmath15 if the product map of the associated unipotent root subgroups : @xmath23 is birational .",
    "a simple example for a birational sequence is the case where @xmath24 is just an enumeration of the set of all positive roots ( the pbw - type case ) , another example is the case where @xmath24 consists only of simple roots and @xmath25 is a reduced decomposition of the longest word in the weyl group @xmath26 of @xmath8 . for other examples",
    "see section  [ examplegenerating ] .",
    "the second ingredient in our approach is the choice of a weight function @xmath27 and a refinement of the associated partial order `` @xmath28 '' to a monomial order `` @xmath29 '' on @xmath30 .",
    "we use the birational map @xmath31 and the total order `` @xmath29 '' to associate to the variety @xmath2 in two different ways a monoid @xmath32 .",
    "the main results of the article can be summarized as follows :    _ if the monoid @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , then : _    *",
    "@xmath33 is the set of integral points of a rational polyhedral cone @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is a normal toric variety for the torus @xmath36 . *",
    "given an affine spherical @xmath8-variety @xmath37 , there exists a flat and @xmath0-equivariant degeneration of @xmath37 into a @xmath38-normal toric variety @xmath39 such that the cone associated to @xmath39 is the intersection of @xmath40 with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the weight cone of @xmath37 . *",
    "given a polarized @xmath8-variety @xmath43 , there exists a family of @xmath0-varieties @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a normal variety , together with divisorial sheaves @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , such that @xmath48 is projective and flat , @xmath48 is trivial with fiber @xmath37 over the complement of @xmath49 in @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for all @xmath52 , the fiber of @xmath48 at @xmath49 is isomorphic to @xmath39 , and @xmath53 for all @xmath52 . in particular , if @xmath37 is spherical , then @xmath39 is a normal toric variety for the torus @xmath36 . *",
    "given a polarized spherical @xmath8-variety @xmath43 , denote by @xmath54 and by @xmath55 the associated moment polytopes .",
    "the projection @xmath56 onto the first factor restricts to a surjective map @xmath57 , with fiber over any @xmath58 being the essential polytope @xmath59 ( [ esspoly ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath60 let @xmath61 be the stabilizer of the line @xmath62\\in \\mathbb p(v(\\lambda))$ ] . the limit variety @xmath39 of the flag variety @xmath63 is a normal toric variety under @xmath64 , and its moment polytope is the essential polytope @xmath59 .",
    "_ the reduced decomposition case . _ for details see section  [ stringconeproof ] : fix a reduced decomposition @xmath65 of the longest word @xmath66 in @xmath26 , let @xmath67 be the associated string cone defined in @xcite and set @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the height weighted degree function @xmath70 .",
    "we fix on @xmath30 the associated @xmath71-weighted opposite lexicographic order .",
    "the monoid @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , and the cone @xmath40 is the cone @xmath72 defined by the weight inequalities in .",
    "so we recover the case studied by alexeev , brion @xcite and kaveh @xcite .",
    "_ lusztig s pbw - case .",
    "_ for details see section  [ lusztig ] : fix a reduced decomposition @xmath65 of the longest word @xmath66 in @xmath26 and let @xmath22 be the enumeration of the positive roots associated to the decomposition , i.e. , @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath69 be the height weighted degree function as above , we fix on @xmath30 the associated @xmath71-weighted opposite right lexicographic order .",
    "the monoid @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , the cone @xmath40 can be described using lusztig s piecewise linear combinatorics in the ade case respectively the piecewise linear combinatorics developed in @xcite in the general case .    _ the homogeneous pbw - case . _ for details see section  [ homordercase ] : let @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath77 be a good ordering of the positive roots and let @xmath69 be the degree function @xmath78 .",
    "we fix on @xmath30 the induced homogeneous right lexicographic order .",
    "the monoid @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , the cone @xmath40 is the cone described in @xcite , see also section  [ homordercase ] .",
    "it remains to justify the claim that the method unifies the three approaches mentioned at the beginning .",
    "indeed , connections have been observed before : the relation between newton - okounkov bodies and the approach via filtrations has been described in @xcite and , vice versa , kiritchenko recovers in @xcite the polytopes described in @xcite as newton - okounkov bodies .",
    "the connection between the dual canonical basis , string cones and newton - okounkov bodies is described in @xcite . the aim of this article is to develop for flag varieties ( or , more general , for spherical varieties ) an approach such that all three aspects are inherent to the approach from the very beginning .    as a first step we use in section  [ svaluationsemigroup ] the birational map @xmath31 and the monomial order `` @xmath29 '' to define a @xmath79-valued valuation @xmath80 on the field of rational functions @xmath81 and associate to @xmath2 the valuation monoid @xmath82)$ ] .",
    "this construction has been inspired by the theory of newton - okounkov bodies .    in the sections  [ essential1 ] and [ filtandsemi ] , we provide a different way to construct the monoid .",
    "the birationality of @xmath31 implies on the level of enveloping algebras that the set of ordered monomials of root vectors @xmath83 forms a spanning set for @xmath7 as a vector space . in combination with the fixed total order",
    " @xmath29 \" on @xmath30 , we define an increasing filtration of @xmath7 by finite dimensional subspaces such that the subquotients are of dimension smaller than or equal to one . as in @xcite ,",
    "this filtration can be used to associate to @xmath2 the monoid @xmath6 of _ essential _ monomials .",
    "essential means in this context that the class of the monomial occurs as a basis vector of a one dimensional subquotient of the filtration .",
    "we prove in section  [ dualessentialsection ] that the _ valuation monoid _",
    "@xmath84)$ ] and the _ essential monoid _",
    "@xmath6 coincide .",
    "hence we get a monoid @xmath3 attached to @xmath2 which depends on the choice of a birational sequence @xmath24 and the choice of the monomial order `` @xmath29 '' . the most important property proved in this section",
    "concerns the third aspect : the basis of @xmath7 given by the essential monomials gives via duality rise to a basis of @xmath5 $ ] which we call the _ dual essential basis_. it turns out that this vector space basis of @xmath5 $ ] has multiplicative properties similar to those of the dual canonical basis .",
    "so once one knows that @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , then one can view @xmath35 as a toric variety for the torus @xmath36 , which can be obtained as a flat @xmath0-equivariant degeneration of @xmath2 .",
    "one can transfer the approach of alexeev and brion @xcite without any change ( up to some details ) to this more general setting and prove the same results about @xmath0-equivariant flat toric degenerations of spherical varieties and moment polytopes , see sections  [ affg ] and [ polytopesection ] . in section  [ qcf ]",
    "we discuss the quasi - commutative case , i.e. , the associated graded vector space @xmath85 has in addition an algebra structure making it isomorphic to @xmath86 . if @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated , then the toric variety @xmath39 inherits in the quasi - commutative case an action of a commutative unipotent group @xmath87 .    summarizing : the new approach combines ideas coming from the theory of newton - okounkov bodies with ideas originally stemming from pbw - filtrations . as a side effect",
    "we get a vector space basis of @xmath5 $ ] which has multiplicative properties very close to those of the dual canonical basis .",
    "this makes it possible to transfer the methods of alexeev and brion @xcite to this more general setting , once we know that the monoid @xmath6 is finitely generated and saturated .",
    "we conjecture , that @xmath6 is always finitely generated . but",
    "note that , as the example in @xcite concerning the lie algebra of type @xmath88 shows , @xmath6 will not be saturated in general .",
