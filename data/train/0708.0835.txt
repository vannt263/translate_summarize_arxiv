    "spectroscopic followup has provided substantial samples of confirmed @xmath16 galaxies @xcite .",
    "these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are known to have high star formation rates relative to local galaxies of the same stellar mass , as revealed by their high rest frame uv luminosity @xcite . until recently , stellar masses for these objects",
    "were estimated using ground  based optical photometry . at these wavelengths in the rest ",

    "frame k band luminosity to place more robust constraints on the bulk of the stellar content of lbgs at @xmath14 @xcite .    at the same time , recent theoretical modeling @xcite and simulations @xcite have suggested a link between merging galaxy populations , quasars , and present day ellipticals through the self  regulated growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in gas  rich major mergers @xcite .",
    "the presence of large amounts of dust @xcite that implies a high sfr , in combination with clustering arguments @xcite , and a merging fraction of @xmath18 at high redshift @xcite have suggested empirically that high  redshift lbgs may be the progenitors of those same present  day ellipticals @xcite . as a result ,",
    "major mergers involving lbgs at high redshift may provide observational evidence of a link between these populations .    in this work we present optical through infrared observations of hdf ",

    "this object , and its previously unidentified companion , constitute the most distant interacting system observed to date for which the resolved morphology clearly suggests a merger . in   [ sec : phot ] , we present multiwavelength data for the hdf  g4 system . from these data , in   [ sec : pops ] , we use stellar population synthesis models to derive stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) for each component . in   [ sec : sims ] , we use the observed stellar populations and morpholgy to constrain a model of the hdf  g4 system using hydrodynamical simulations . finally , in   [",
    "sec : discuss ] , we discuss the implications of the predictions of our model for the future evolution of the hdf  g4 system .",
    "our analysis suggests that hdf ",
    "g4 will be a high  redshift passive spheroid by @xmath22 , similar to those observed by @xcite and @xcite . for the proceeding analysis",
    ", we assume the concordance cosmological model ; a flat @xmath23cdm cosmology with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "all magnitudes presented are in the ab system .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , which includes the hdfn , is the deepest multi - wavelength survey , detecting galaxies at extremely high redshifts in optical and ir bands @xcite , and potentially interacting systems at very high redshift at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the wealth of multi  wavelength data available for goods fields , from the x  ray to radio , makes it ideal for studying the properties of such interesting systems .",
    "we visually inspected the available optical imaging data , and find that hdf - g4 appears to be one object in the ground  based subaru images @xcite , but is resolved into two objects in the acs mosaic @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry obtained with sextractor , a publicly available source detection and photometry package @xcite , for both the primary ( c1 ) and secondary ( c2 ) components were taken from the public catalog for all four acs mosaics : f435w ( @xmath1 ) , f606w ( @xmath27 ) , f775w ( @xmath28 ) , and f850lp ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "c2 is 1 magnitude fainter in the acs @xmath28 band , and @xmath30 away from c1 .",
    "furthermore , the position angle and center of the slit  mask indicate that the observed optical spectrum is of c1 only .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are three pieces of evidence suggesting that c1 and c2 are physically associated with each other .",
    "the first is that both objects are @xmath1 dropouts with similar observed optical colors , indicating that they are at comparable redshift .",
    "the second is their relative angular separation , which at @xmath0 corresponds to a projected internuclear distance of 7 kpc .",
    "this is similar to local interacting systems such as the `` antennae '' @xcite , ii zw 96 @xcite , or ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the third , and most compelling piece of evidence is a material bridge connecting both components .",
    "this feature is low surface brightness  typically no more than 2@xmath31 above the sky noise per pixel  but highly statistically significant ; a monte ",
    "carlo analysis indicates that it is detected at 10@xmath31 in the stacked optical image ( see figure  [ fig : opticalimg ] ) .",
    "it furthermore has similar colors to c1 and c2 , and is not detected in @xmath1 ( see table  [ tab : photometry ] ) .",
    "this system is also marginally detected in the cfht wircam j and k band images ( lin 2006 , simard 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "the centroid of the k - band counterpart is @xmath32 offset from c1 , but @xmath33 from c2 .",
    "given the @xmath34 seeing in the j and k images , we argue the detected j- and k - band flux is dominated by c1 .",
    "the goods irac image is very deep , and thus both c1 and c2 should be detected at least at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "indeed , we find significant detections at 3.6 and 4.5 , and marginal detections at 5.8 and 8.0(see figure  [ fig : irimg ] ) .",
    "we obtain aperture photometry ( see table  [ tab : photometry ] ) for hdf ",
    "g4 , after subtracting out bright neighbors to minimize contamination using starfinder , a publically available psf  fitting photometry package @xcite .",
    "errors were estimated using a monte  carlo analysis .",
    "irac , however , has @xmath35 resolution , and thus can not resolve c1 and c2 .",
    "we use the @xmath29 flux ratio to estimate the c2 contribution to the total irac flux of this system .",
    "c2 has a somewhat bluer color with @xmath36 , as compared to c1 with @xmath37 .",
    "this is very similar to a merging system at z=3.01 found by @xcite , in which the ir flux densities are dominated by the red luminous component .",
    "we argue that c2 should also have bluer @xmath38 $ ] color than c1 , and use the @xmath29 flux ratio to estimate an upper limit of 10% on the contribution of c2 to the unresolved irac flux densities .",
    "the hdfn was additionally covered by the very large array at @xmath39 ghz to a depth of 40 @xmath40jy @xcite , mips to a depth of @xmath41jy at 24 , and the _ chandra _ x  ray telescope to depths of @xmath42 and @xmath43 erg @xmath44 in the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) bands respectively @xcite .",
    "there was , however , no detection of either hdf  g4 or its companion in the publicly released source lists or imaging data .",
    "this is all consistent  and in particular the lack of 24or 1.4 ghz emission  with the high redshift of hdf ",
    "we present the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of hdf ",
    "g4 ( open circles ) and and its companion ( open triangles ) , along with best fit models ( see   [ sec : pops ] ) in figure  [ fig : sed ] . all the available photometry for c1 , c2 , and the bridge are presented in table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "our observations of each component of the hdf  g4 system can be used to constrain the underlying stellar population at the time of our observations . to estimate the age and mass of the stellar population of the primary component of hdf ",
    "g4 ( c1 ) , we fit its sed to a grid of population synthesis models @xcite , assuming a @xcite imf , with three different parameterized star formation histories : a single stellar population ( ssp ) instantaneous burst , continuous star formation ( csf ) , and an exponential decay @xmath45model ( esf ) .",
    "we consider solar and sub  solar ( @xmath46 ) models , in addition to including the effects of @xcite dust extinction and @xcite lyman@xmath12 forest absorption .",
    "our fits exclude observations in irac channels 3 and 4 , which are poorly constrained by the measurement .",
    "results for the best  fit csf and esf models are shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] ; the ssp models were excluded because they were both a poor fit to the data . requiring the age of the stellar population @xmath47 to be less than a hubble time at @xmath0 further excludes the sub ",
    "solar csf and esf models .",
    "the best fit overall , with @xmath48 was the solar metallicity esf model , with @xmath7folding time @xmath8 my , stellar age @xmath6 myr , stellar mass @xmath5 , and dust extinction @xmath49 . the best ",
    "fit csf model , with @xmath50 , had @xmath51 myr , @xmath5 , @xmath52 , and star formation rate sfr = 32 .",
    "these results are somewhat sensitive to the choice of imf ; e.g. , assuming a @xcite distribution will reduce the inferred stellar masses by @xmath53 .",
    "these inferred stellar masses and sfrs are broadly consistent with studies applying a similar analysis to large populations of lbgs @xcite , and with 8selected lbgs with similar infrared  to  optical colors at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we note that our best fit stellar populations indicate minimal dust extinction , which is unusual for lbgs but is consistent with the least obscured objects at @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we do not have sufficient spectral coverage to fit models to the photometry for c2 or the bridge .",
    "however , at @xmath0 , the observed optical images cover the rest ",
    "frame ultraviolet continuum from 800 - 2310 .",
    "the integrated spectrum in this waveband is dominated by young stars , and therefore scales linearly with the star formation rate @xcite . using the calibrations of @xcite for the intrinsic luminosity at 1500  , which assume csf and a @xcite imf , we find that our @xmath28 ( rest  frame @xmath56 ) photometry implies sfr @xmath57 9 .",
    "similarly , the bridge traces significant off  nuclear star formation , with sfr @xmath57 3 as inferred from the @xmath28 magnitude .",
    "if a @xcite imf is used , these estimates increase by a factor of @xmath58 .    the lack of a detection of hdf ",
    "g4 in deep _",
    "observations can constrain the relative contributions of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and stellar components of the bolometric luminosity in c1 . from the agn sed template of @xcite",
    ", we find that the limiting flux of the hard band ( @xmath59 kev ) puts a strict upper limit , in the absence of significant scattering or absorption by dust , of @xmath60 on the bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "we believe that neglecting the effects of dust on the emitted x  rays is a good approximation for two reasons : the population synthesis fits indicate that there is little dust attenuation in the optical , and at @xmath0 the _ chandra _ hard band probes very hard x  rays ( @xmath61 kev ) that are largely unaffected by dust in the line of sight .",
    "the integrated intrinsic stellar luminosity , from the best ",
    "fit esf model , is @xmath62 , which constrains the ratio of the luminosity of the agn to the stellar component of hdf ",
    "g4 to @xmath63 ; c1 is clearly starburst dominated .",
    "in order to gain some insight into the nature of the hdf  g4 system , we have employed hydrodynamic simulations and designed a model for the encounter .",
    "our simulations were preformed using an updated version of the publicly available n  body / sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "they include star formation , supernova feedback , and black hole accretion ; for a detailed description of our methodology , see @xcite . using this code , we track the interaction and merger of two disk galaxies whose properties are scaled , as in @xcite , to be appropriate for a redshift of @xmath64 .",
    "the progenitor galaxy models are motivated by the stellar mass and size of the observed components of the hdf  g4 system .",
    "in particular , the observed relative fluxes of c1 and c2 , assuming a constant @xmath65 ratio , imply a 2:1 interaction .",
    "this is reproduced with progenitor disks initialized with circular velocities of @xmath66 and 200 km s@xmath67 respectively , where @xmath68 is the keplerian circular velocity at a mean overdensity of 200@xmath69 .",
    "both models have baryon fractions of 5% and initial gas fractions of @xmath70 , which is consistent with gas fractions observed in @xmath11 disks @xcite , and is further motivated by models @xcite to explain large black hole to host stellar mass ratios at @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "they are realized with @xmath72 and @xmath73 dark matter , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 baryonic particles respectively .",
    "our high redshift merger model assumes that hdf ",
    "g4 is witnessed soon after the first passage of the two galaxies .",
    "this is based on the appreciable projected physical separation that implies a lower limit of 7 kpc on the internuclear distance , regular appearance , and bridge of material that connects the two components .",
    "the bridge in particular , while potentially reflective of the irregular rest  frame uv morphology of star  forming systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is also a characteristic feature of galaxy interactions at low redshift and provides the strongest constraints on the mutual orbit .",
    "a prograde encounter for either galaxy can be ruled out based upon the absence of the symmetric tidal features that these interactions produce .",
    "more likely is a fairly direct encounter in which the galaxies interpenetrate at first passage and material is strewn out to form a bridge between them .",
    "after several trials , the best fitting orbit was parabolic  in agreement with likely orbital geometrics from cosmological simulations @xcite  with a small perigalacticon of 1 kpc and both disks oriented nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "snapshots of the stellar mass distribution , including three different projections of the remnant , at different stages of the encounter are shown in figure  [ fig : panels ] .",
    "we treat the stellar particles as @xcite ssps with ages and metallicities according to their formation time .",
    "stars initialized with the progenitor disks are assumed to have formed 0.7 gyr before the start of the simulation with low metallicity @xmath76 .",
    "we neglect absorption and scattering by dust because the stellar population synthesis analysis in   [ sec : pops ] indicates that hdf ",
    "g4 is virtually dust  free .",
    "the best match to the observed optical morphology ( rest  frame uv @xmath77 ) of hdf ",
    "g4 was at @xmath78 gyr after the start of the simulation , and is shown in figure  [ fig : uvmorph ] . the snapshot shows the rest ",
    "frame @xmath79 surface brightness at the resolution of the observations in figure  [ fig : opticalimg ] for @xmath0 , and convolved with the acs psf .",
    "the stellar mass at this snapshot is @xmath80 with a total sfr of 59 ; both within the observational constraints given the uncertainty in the imf and relative @xmath65 ratios of c1 and c2 .",
    "the synthetic seds of the two components over the physical scales in the acs image , shown in figure  [ fig : merger_colors ] , are also a close match to the observations . finally , the total luminosity from accretion onto the black hole is @xmath81 , which is well within the upper limit of @xmath82 imposed by the observations .",
    "the ability of simulations to reproduce the observable features of this object supports our interpretation that hdf ",
    "g4 is an early  stage merger .",
    "finally , we note as a caveat that the isophotal shapes in figure  [ fig : uvmorph ] are somewhat more elongated than those in the optical imaging data . though our population synthesis modeling suggests that the overall effects of dust in the hdf ",
    "g4 system are small , because this is the rest ",
    "frame uv , even small amounts of dust in these elongations could substantially change their appearance in simulated observations .",
    "the structure of these features is also sensitive to the specific orbital geometry and the detailed structure of the progenitor disks , both of which may not be precisely captured in our modeling .",
    "the bridge , on the other hand , is produced by ram ",
    "pressure stripping of gas when the progenitors interpenetrate .",
    "furthermore , if there were small amounts of dust in the system , this stripping would not necessarily carry the dust along with it . as a result , though the detailed isophotal shapes of the two components are sensitive to the initial conditions of our simulations , we believe that production of a uv  bright bridge between the two components is generic for any encounter with a small impact parameter , and is therefore the best evidence for an ongoing merger and the applicability of our modeling .",
    "in figure  [ fig : evol ] , we use our simulation to predict the future evolution of the hdf  g4 system .",
    "this indicates that the two components will finally coalesce , with a peak in the starburst and agn luminosity , around a redshift of @xmath83 . at this time , the hdf ",
    "g4 system will be a @xmath84 quasar . based on the @xcite quasar luminosity function models",
    ", we would expect there to be of order a couple such systems in the goods  north field .",
    "although we can not robustly constrain the space densities of these mergers , it is conservatively consistent with the expected counts .",
    "our simulations also suggest that by a redshift of @xmath85 , hdf  g4 will have a spheroidal morphology ( see figure  [ fig : panels ] ) , a stellar mass of @xmath86 @xmath87 , and a sfr of 8.8 ; a slowly star  forming but not entirely passive elliptical .",
    "its colors will be red , with @xmath88 , which is close to the color cut of @xmath89 for distant red galaxies ( drgs : * ? ? ?",
    "the remnant also has a small effective radius  measured as in @xcite  relative to local spheroids of the same mass , with @xmath90 kpc and an average inner stellar surface mass density within @xmath91 of @xmath92 @xmath87 kpc@xmath93 , where the errors take into account projection effects .",
    "this makes it similar to the compact , quiescent high redshift spheroids at @xmath94 observed by @xcite and @xcite , who find effective radii of @xmath95 kpc , inner stellar surface mass densities of @xmath96 @xmath87 kpc@xmath93 , and stellar masses of @xmath97 @xmath87 .",
    "the existence of such an object further lends observational support to galaxy formation models which argue that mergers dominate the high - redshift buildup of spheroids and black holes @xcite .",
    "it is difficult , on the other hand , to reconcile this with models which argue that spheroid and black hole formation at high redshift is driven by direct gas collapse / cooling @xcite or disk instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter model , for example",
    ", mergers contribute only @xmath98 of bulge and bh growth at these redshifts , which would predict systems like hdf - g4 should be too rare to observe in small fields , should be already `` dry '' ( i.e. spheroid - dominated , with much lower current sfrs ) , and should have pre - existing large bhs from their disk phase ( given the disk masses and gas fractions necessarily present at these redshifts ) which would , given gas is clearly still present ( from the observed sfr ) , inescapably make the system a ( @xmath99 ) quasar at the observed time .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to see if future observations of wider fields reveal hdf ",
    "g4 to be anomalous , or representative of a typical , albeit brief , phase of lbg evolution .",
    "we present the rest ",
    "frame uv through nir sed for hdf ",
    "g4 , an interacting lyman break galaxy in goods - north with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of @xmath0 @xcite , using data obtained from acs , wircam , and irac .",
    "the two objects in this system  hdf  g4 and its previously unidentified companion  are both @xmath1 band dropouts , have similar @xmath2 and @xmath3 colors , and are separated by @xmath4 , which at @xmath0 corresponds to 7 kpc projected nuclear separation , and a bridge of material between them .",
    "we apply stellar population synthesis models @xcite to the sed of hdf ",
    "g4 , and find a best ",
    "fit population with solar metallically , an exponential star formation history , with @xmath7folding time @xmath8 my , stellar age @xmath6 myr , stellar mass @xmath5 , and dust extinction @xmath49 with a reduced @xmath100 . the observed stellar population , combined with the sed , system morphology , and projected nuclear separation , are used to constrain a model of the hdf ",
    "g4 system using a hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "this analysis suggests that hdf ",
    "g4 is the potential progenitor of a @xmath101 quasar with @xmath102 @xmath103 , and a compact ( @xmath104 kpc ) quiescent @xmath10 spheroid consistent with the population observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of such an object supports galaxy formation models in which major mergers drive the high redshift buildup of spheroids and black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
