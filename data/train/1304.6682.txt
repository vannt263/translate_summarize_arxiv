    "since the experimental observation of graphene,@xcite a two - dimensional form of carbon , there have been many theoretical and experimental studies to understand and take advantage of its surprising properties.@xcite among its most interesting features , one can cite the peculiar interplay between its electronic and its mechanical properties .",
    "graphene can withstand elastic deformations up to @xmath1% , much more than in any other crystal.@xcite needless to say , this long interval of elastic response results in strong changes in the electronic structure , which offers a new direction of exploration in electronics : strain engineering .",

    "( d ) how the distortion of the reciprocal lattice transform the original dirac cone ( left ) into a distorted one ( right ) with a directional dependent fermi velocity.,width=302 ]    the most popular model proposed in the literature for studying the concept of strain engineering is based on a combination of a tight - binding ( tb ) description of the electrons and linear elasticity theory.@xcite in this approach , where the absence of electron - electron interactions is assumed , the electronic implications of lattice deformations are captured by means of a pseudovector potential @xmath6 which is related to the strain tensor @xmath7 by@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9   is the unstrained carbon - carbon distance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) and @xmath10 modulates the variation of the hopping energy @xmath11 of the tb model with the changes in the intercarbon distance due to lattice deformations.@xcite note that , the @xmath12 axis is selected parallel to the zigzag direction . this @xmath13dependent pseudovector potential gives a coupling of the pseudomagnetic field ( @xmath14 ) with the electronic density .",
    "the idea of pseudomagnetic fields has been key in the understanding of the pseudo landau levels experimental observations made in strained graphene , which had been theoretically predicted earlier.@xcite    in recent works , the standard description of the strain - induced vector field has been supplemented with the explicit inclusion of the local deformation of the lattice vectors.@xcite after accounting for the actual atomic positions to the tb hamiltonian , kitt _ et al . _",
    "proposed an extra pseudovector potential which is @xmath13independent and different at each of the strained dirac points.@xcite the possible physical relevance of the extra @xmath13independent term , predicted in the work of kitt _ et al .",
    "_ , was discussed by de juan _ et al .",
    "_ within the tb approach.@xcite they also obtained an extra @xmath13independent pseudovector potential but with zero curl .",
    "therefore , they concluded that in strained graphene no @xmath13independent pseudomagnetic field exist.@xcite    the controversy created by kitt _ et al . _ has also been solved in refs .",
    "21 and 22 , where the concept of renormalization of the reciprocal space was a core and novel idea developed to meet that end .",
    "however , as has been documented in ref .",
    "7 , the positions of the energy minima and maxima ( dirac points ) do not coincide with the high - symmetry points at the corners of the renormalized brillouin zone ( e.g. , the @xmath0 point in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) .",
    "this last statement motivates us to seek the effective hamiltonian around the dirac points using such renormalization , since , as shown here , this is essential to understand the experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the most simple case , a spatially uniform strain .",
    "the reason is that such a case must be contained as a limiting case in any of the general theories , and at the same time , as shown here , it can be solved exactly .",
    "thus , it is an important benchmark tool to compare and discriminate the goodness of previous approaches .",
    "for example , this leads to a simple explanation for the lattice correction terms and direction dependent fermi velocity , since both are due to the effects of strain in reciprocal space .",
    "hopefully , this will help to derive the consequences of lattice corrections of flexural modes or curved graphene .",
    "the layout of this work is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model and find the corresponding energy dispersion surface . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the properties of the energy dispersion and find the analytical expressions for the shift of the dirac points and the strained dirac hamiltonian . section iv deals with the problem of how the usual pseudomagnetic fields approach needs to be added with some requirements in order to compare experiments and simulations .",
    "finally , in the last section , our conclusions are given .",
    "we are interested in uniform planar strain situations , i.e. , the components of two - dimensional strain tensor @xmath7 are assumed to be position - independent . in this case , the displacement vector @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , and therefore , the actual position of an atom @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the @xmath20 identity matrix .",
    "in general , if @xmath21 represents a general vector in the unstrained graphene lattice , its strained counterpart is given by the relationship @xmath22 .",
    "we investigate the electronic implications of strain by means of the nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath23 where @xmath24 runs over all sites of the deformed @xmath3 sublattice and @xmath25 are the three nearest neighbor vectors .",
    "the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to creating and annihilating electrons on the sublattices @xmath3 and @xmath28 , at sites @xmath24 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the dispersion relation arise upon writing eq .",
    "( [ tbh ] ) in the momentum space . for this purpose",
    ", we replace the creation / annihilation operators by their fourier expansions@xcite    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the number of elementary cells . in eq .",
    "( [ tbh ] ) we have written the hopping integral @xmath32 as position - dependent , but in the considered case ( uniform strain ) , it does not depend on the position , only on the direction : @xmath33 .",
    "under these considerations , calculation of the hamiltonian in the @xmath34-space is fairly straightforward , @xmath35 becomes @xmath36    from this equation , it follows that the dispersion relation of graphene under spatially uniform strain is @xmath37 which is a closed expression for the energy .",
    "this equation provides a benchmark tool case for testing any hamiltonian concerning strain in graphene , and suggests the procedure that is developed in the following section . if in eq .",
    "( [ gdr ] ) , we define an auxiliary reciprocal vector @xmath38 , the dispersion relationship is almost equal to the case in unstrained graphene , except for the different values of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "when such hopping changes are not considered , as explained in the following section , one gets that , @xmath41 which is exactly the same hamiltonian as for unstrained graphene but now with @xmath34 replaced with @xmath42 . here ,",
    "no approximations are used and the spectrum can be obtained for all values of @xmath42 . if this hamiltonian develops around the corresponding dirac point , it is obvious that the same dirac hamiltonian observed in unstrained graphene will appear ( see below ) , with @xmath34 replaced with @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests doing a renormalization of the reciprocal space as performed in the next section , a result that was also found in refs .",
    "21 and 22 .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ gdr ] ) can be numerically evaluated to test any effective hamiltonian obtained by developing around particular points in @xmath43 space .",
    "it is important to remark that in the general case of a non - uniform strain , @xmath25 are not given by @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", @xmath45 needs to be replaced by the displacement gradient tensor @xmath46.@xcite .",
    "see in ref .",
    "20 how the use of @xmath47 , allowed kitt _",
    "_ to solve the controversy concerning whether or not lattice corrections produce pseudovector potentials .",
    "the variation of the hopping energy @xmath48 with the changes in the intercarbon distance fulfills a physically accurate exponential decay @xmath49 $ ] , with @xmath50  ev being the equilibrium hopping energy.@xcite nevertheless , for the sake of comparison with previous works we consider first order in strain , @xmath51    defining the three nearest neighbor vectors as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath52 and plugging eq .",
    "( [ aproxt ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gdr ] ) , one gets the following expression for the dispersion relation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 has exactly the same functional form of its unstrained graphene counterpart,@xcite @xmath55 but now evaluated in different points of reciprocal space , since here @xmath56 is given by the transformation , @xmath57    this last equation is very important .",
    "it provides a mapping of the original reciprocal space into a new distorted one . as we will see , this mapping and the fact that @xmath54 is equal to its undistorted counterpart lead to pure geometrical effects that only very recently have been identified.@xcite the other terms depend on the same distortion , but contain hopping corrections .",
    "these terms are explicitly detailed in the appendix  [ aa ] .",
    "@xmath58 contains the modification of the spectrum due to first order in @xmath59 , while @xmath60 is the second order correction in @xmath59 .",
    "several important consequences follow from these equations .",
    "first of all , one can observe that in the case of deforming the lattice without changing the hopping parameters , i.e. , if one deforms the lattice keeping @xmath61 , @xmath62 is simplified to : @xmath63    this corresponds to the same dispersion relationship observed in graphene , but now with different reciprocal vectors , which are obtained by applying strain to the original reciprocal vectors .",
    "in other words , the space is strained while the eigenvalues remain the same . as a consequence ,",
    "the dirac cone changes its shape due to this lattice deformation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this is exactly the result that we would obtain if a diagonalization of the tight - binding hamiltonian is performed using a computer .",
    "since @xmath61 and the connectivity of the lattice is not changed , the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian must remain equal to the undistorted case .",
    "only when a plot is made _ against the wavevectors _ , the cone turns out to be distorted , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( d ) .",
    "for example , the brick wall lattice has the same connectivity as graphene , and thus the spectrum must be the same . however , only when the spectrum is plotted in reciprocal space , the energy - momentum relationship appears distorted .",
    "also , the case @xmath61 allows us to appreciate a subtle point . since the spectrum is the same as in unstrained graphene , it is easy to see that the @xmath64 symmetry points of the distorted lattice coincide with the dirac point of the new relationship given by eq .",
    "( [ purerelation ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the condition @xmath65 , which defines the @xmath66 dirac points , corresponds to @xmath67 , where @xmath5 is the image of the point @xmath4 under the mapping @xmath68 .",
    "thus , for @xmath61 it makes sense to develop the tb hamiltonian around the original dirac points , as @xmath69 , with @xmath70 .",
    "it is easy to show that the pure geometrical distortion allows us to write the dirac hamiltonian as ( see appendix  [ ab ] ) , @xmath71 @xmath72 being the momentum measured relatively to the dirac points , @xmath73 the fermi velocity for the undeformed lattice , @xmath74 the two pauli matrices and @xmath75 turns out to be the spinorial connection.@xcite from this equation follows a directional dependent fermi velocity for strained graphene , which has also been found in other works.@xcite furthermore , a directional dependent velocity appears simply by looking at the isoenergetic curves of eq .",
    "( [ purerelation ] ) around @xmath5 . in this case one obtains @xmath76 therefore , the isoenergetic curves around @xmath5 are rotated ellipses , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) .",
    "this figure was made for a zigzag uniaxial strain of @xmath77% , i.e. , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the poisson ratio , which is very low for graphene , @xmath81 , according to some theoretical estimations.@xcite    at this point , one can conclude that the basic mechanism behind the anisotropic fermi velocity is the distortion of the reciprocal space .",
    "such distortion gives a simple interpretation to the resulting geometric crystal frame terms that appears in the covariant version of the equations.@xcite clearly , there are not associated pseudomagnetic fields.@xcite      let us now consider the case in which the space is distorted and the hopping is changed , i.e. , @xmath82 . here , we will have two effects .",
    "again one has the pure geometrical distortion due to the strain of the reciprocal space , but at the same time , there is a change in the spectrum .",
    "this last effect is the only one observed when a diagonalization of the hamiltonian is performed in a computer for a finite number of atoms .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a comparison between the cases @xmath61 and @xmath82 is presented for @xmath62 .",
    "as can be seen , the effect of @xmath82 is to distort the @xmath61 case in such a way that it tends to compensate the strain of the reciprocal space , i.e. , the ellipses are rotated by @xmath83 for a realistic value of @xmath59 .",
    "the physical reason for this occurrence is that a stretched direction in real space shirks in reciprocal space , resulting in a higher fermi velocity , while in the same direction , the orbital overlap decreases since the distance between atoms increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this tends to reduce the fermi velocity . as a result ,",
    "lattice distortion and hopping changes tend to compensate .",
    "this fact can also be seen in the movement of the dirac points . from the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one can see that the dirac points for the case @xmath82 are closer to the original ones than their @xmath61 counterparts .",
    "the qualitative results discussed above , and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , can be understood by finding analytical expressions for @xmath66 and @xmath35 .",
    "the position of @xmath66 can be obtained from the condition @xmath65 . up to first order in strain",
    ", we obtained that @xmath66 is given as follows : @xmath84 with @xmath6 defined by eq .",
    "( [ vp ] ) and @xmath85 the valley index of @xmath86.@xcite the previous equation confirms the remark that the dirac points for @xmath82 do not coincide with the @xmath5 high symmetry points of the strained brillouin zone .",
    "the shift , which is only produced by @xmath59 , is given by the pseudovector potential , and do not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , once the points @xmath66 are known , it is possible to obtain a new dirac hamiltonian considering the lattice correction and orbital overlap changes . to do this",
    ", we developed eq .",
    "( [ k - h ] ) around the dirac points using eq .",
    "( [ newkd ] ) , and derived that ( see appendix  [ ac ] ) @xmath87 which is a general version of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , since @xmath59 effects are included .",
    "notice that the isoenergetic curves around @xmath66 remain ellipses , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( c ) , but with different values of the semi - axes owing to the @xmath59 corrections .",
    "the last equation clearly shows the tendency of @xmath59 to cancel the lattice corrections .",
    "let us make two important remarks about eqs .",
    "( [ newkd ] ) and ( [ newh ] ) , which are among the main contributions of this paper . first , these equations are a generalization of analogous expressions to the case of graphene under uniaxial strain which were inherited from studies on deformed carbon nanotubes.@xcite similar expressions were also found for a particular case of distortion without shear .",
    "thus , our generalization can be reduced to other special cases for which the results are known , @xcite and coincides with the exact solvable case for @xmath61 .",
    "such limiting cases allows us to check in different ways the validity of the presented results .",
    "second , eq .  ( [ newh ] ) can not be derived from the theory of the strain - induced pseudomagnetic field .",
    "namely , the effective dirac hamiltonian obtained by this theory does not reduce to our eq .",
    "( [ newh ] ) for the case of uniform strain , for reasons explained in the following section .",
    "from the point of view developed in the previous section , it is clear that basically , the dirac cone is translated and distorted . as a result ,",
    "if one tries to derive an effective dirac equation using @xmath4 as starting points to develop @xmath62 as @xmath88 , the resulting energy can be quite far away from the fermi energy , as shown in fig .",
    "this poses a problem that has been overlooked in the usual treatment of strain in graphene using pseudomagnetic fields in the dirac equations .    in general , if eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is developed around a general point in reciprocal space given by @xmath89 , we get , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the jacobian vector and @xmath92 , the hessian matrix of @xmath93 , which are evaluated at @xmath94 .    in the usual procedure @xmath95 .",
    "however , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this produces an energy shift and a @xmath72 dependent term , observed in other approaches,@xcite which complicates the description of the dynamics somehow .",
    "( color online ) the dirac cone in unstrained ( dashed line ) and strained graphene ( solid line ) and the experimental observation of electron behavior for a probe that shifts the chemical potential ( @xmath98 ) with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "the shaded box indicates the width of the thermal selector due to the fermi - dirac distribution . the effective dirac equation with pseudomagnetic fields",
    "can be obtained by developing around the original @xmath4 points , or in the dirac points @xmath99 of the strained lattice . for @xmath100",
    ", only the latter approach will work for low temperatures.,width=302 ]    this also poses an issue concerning the experimental possibility of observing the pseudomagnetic fields .",
    "since the energy evaluated at the original dirac point @xmath101 is different form zero , the fermi energy does not fall at this point , as we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in general ,",
    "if an experiment is performed at temperature @xmath102 , and the chemical potential @xmath98 is shifted by a field , the condition to observe the pseudomagnetic fields in the usual derivation around the original dirac point must satisfy , @xmath103 since the difference between @xmath101 and @xmath98 must be less than a zone defined from the derivative of the fermi - dirac distribution against the energy , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] using a box around @xmath98 . as @xmath104 ,",
    "the derivative is a delta function centered around the fermi energy , and the pseudomagnetic fields calculated from @xmath86 are usually far from the region of validity .",
    "for example , even a zigzag uniaxial strain of @xmath105% , will produce a @xmath106  mev , which is much higher than the thermal width of @xmath107  mev , obtained at @xmath108  k. this breaks the approximation of using pseudomagnetic fields in a dirac equation unless a very well defined field is used .",
    "the option is to have a better description of the energy dispersion near the fermi energy , by developing eq .",
    "( [ energytaylor ] ) around the true dirac points of the strained lattice , i.e. , by setting @xmath109 , for which the corresponding energies fall at the fermi level . in this case , @xmath110 since @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "now one obtains an energy dispersion which corresponds to a distorted cone , with a directional dependent fermi velocity given by the elements of the hessian of @xmath93 evaluated at @xmath99 .",
    "this result is the same as the one obtained from the dirac hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ newh ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the case of a spatially uniform strain in graphene .",
    "the lattice correction terms are simply an effect of the strained reciprocal space . as a consequence ,",
    "the dirac cones are deformed and translated .",
    "no pseudomagnetic fields are associated to such terms , as has been recently discussed.@xcite when hopping changes are considered , there is an extra deformation of the cone that tends to cancel the effect of the reciprocal space strain .",
    "the new dirac points of the strained hamiltonian do not coincide with the @xmath5 symmetry points of the strained reciprocal lattice . due to this fact",
    ", the effective dirac equation can be obtained by developing around the old or the new dirac points .",
    "if the old points are chosen , as is usual in the graphene literature , there is a restriction to observe the dynamics produced by the calculated pseudomagnetic fields since only for very high temperatures or carefully designed probes is it possible to make a comparison with the usual theory . in computer simulations ,",
    "it is also important to distinguish between lattice distortion effects and connectivity matrix . some of these issues , can explain differences between theory and simulations in graphene.@xcite    finally , it is worth mentioning that although we only treated a particular case , the ideas and lessons obtained from this study can be translated to general cases , as we will show in forthcoming works .",
    "the closed dispersion relation derived from this hamiltonian has the form @xmath117 where @xmath54 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section ii , the condition @xmath65 , which defines the @xmath66 dirac points , corresponds to @xmath67 , where @xmath5 is the image of the point @xmath4 under the mapping @xmath68 .",

    "( [ h ] ) . at this point , is clear that the case @xmath61 is a benchmark tool for any effective hamiltonian , since it can be solved without using any approximation .",
