    "the heavy - fermion compound uru@xmath0si@xmath0 has attracted much attention for its mysterious phase , the so called hidden - order ( ho ) phase , whose order parameter is not yet identified despite intense experimental and theoretical efforts for more than a quarter century @xcite .",
    "the ho transition at @xmath2k @xcite accompanies a huge amount of entropy loss , but no magnetic ordering accounting for this change has been observed @xcite . without knowing which symmetry is broken in the ordered phase ,",
    "many theoretical proposals for the ho parameter have been made @xcite .",
    "recent magnetic torque measurements reveal the in - plane anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility @xcite , which suggests that below the ho phase transition the fourfold rotational symmetry in the tetragonal uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is broken .",
    "this newly suggested rotational symmetry breaking has raised several theoretical proposals @xcite , and thus calls for further experimental verifications by using other techniques .",
    "the nature of electronic orders in metals and semiconductors is , in general , closely related to the electronic structure , and the most essential information is the structure of fermi surface ( fs ) . in the case of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , the large loss of entropy @xcite below @xmath3 signifies that a large portion of the fs is gapped in the hidden - order phase , which has also been supported by the transport @xcite and tunneling @xcite measurements . for the understanding of the nature of hidden order , it is indispensable to determine how the electronic structure changes with the gap formation .",
    "in addition to this electronic excitation gap , neutron inelastic scattering experiments@xcite revealed that the gap is formed in the magnetic excitations characterized by two wave vectors : @xmath4 with an energy gap of @xmath5mev and @xmath6 with an energy gap of @xmath7mev .",
    "quantum oscillation experiments @xcite that can yield direct information on the fs structure have revealed the existence of small pockets in the hidden order phase .",
    "however , the total density of states of these pockets is significantly smaller than the estimate from the electronic specific heat , which indicates there must be some fs sheets with heavy mass missing in these experiments .",
    "the most recent measurements of shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect @xcite have suggested that the fs is quite similar to that in the antiferromagnetic phase , which is known to be induced by applying pressure @xcite . in this pressure - induced antiferromagnetic phase ,",
    "large staggered moment along the @xmath8 axis has been observed with the wave vector of @xmath9 , indicating the zone folding associated with the lattice doubling .",
    "such zone folding that has also been suggested by the recent angle - resolved photoemission study in the hidden - order phase @xcite when compared with the fs above @xmath3 @xcite , which further support the similarity between the antiferromagnetic and hidden - order states . however , the hidden order phase , in which no magnetic ordering has been detected , is separated from the pressure - induced antiferromagnetic phase by a phase transition .",
    "then the key question to address is what is the peculiar signature in the electronic structure of the hidden order phase , and in particular it is important to clarify how this is related to the rotational symmetry breaking suggested by the torque measurements .",
    "cyclotron resonance ( cr ) is another powerful probe of the detailed fs structure .",
    "the cr stems from the transition between landau levels formed by the quantized cyclotron motion of the conduction electrons .",
    "it gives direct information on the effective cyclotron mass @xmath10 of electrons moving along extremal orbits on fs sheets through the simple relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the microwave angular frequency and @xmath13 is the resonance field .",
    "the cyclotron mass @xmath10 may be different from the thermodynamic mass or the mass @xmath14 deduced from quantum oscillation measurements . in particular , in one - component translationally invariant systems @xmath10 is not renormalized by the electron - electron interaction ( the kohn s theorem @xcite ) due to the cancellation by the backflow effect , so in this case @xmath10 can be directly compared with the band mass which can be calculated without considering electron correlations .",
    "however , in solids this theorem can be violated @xcite especially for the heavy - fermion systems with interacting conduction and @xmath15 electrons @xcite and for multiband systems @xcite .",
    "therefore the momentum dependence of @xmath10 in each fs should contain important information on the electron correlations in these systems .",
    "recent progress of the high - quality single crystal growth of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 has lead to the first observation of cr among heavy - fermion materials@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the detailed analysis on this observation , which reveals the full determination of the main fs sheets including the missing heavy band .",
    "the in - plane angle dependence of @xmath10 shows an unexpected splitting for the sharpest resonance line , which has been assigned to the hole fs pocket @xmath1 with the largest volume and mobility .",
    "this anomalous two - peak splitting is found near the [ 110 ] direction and the two - peak structure survives against field inclination toward [ 001 ] direction in the measured angle range up to 30@xmath16 .",
    "we compare our cr results with the quantum oscillation results , from which we estimate the electronic specific heat coefficient that can account for more than 80% of the experimental value .",
    "the sdh measurements also report the splitting of the @xmath1 branch for the oscillation frequency which is a measure of the size of the fs , but we propose that this originates from the magnetic breakdown and that our cr mass split has a different origin .",
    "the cr profile analysis allows us to estimate the scattering rates of each orbit , which reveals the emergence of hot spots with larger scattering and heavier mass along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "this electronic structure anomaly gives strong support for the rotational symmetry breaking in the ho phase , providing a stringent constraint on the symmetry of the hidden order .",
    "another important aspect of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is that the ho phase hosts the unconventional superconducting ( sc ) phase below the transition temperature @xmath17k at ambient pressure .",
    "the cyclotron mass @xmath10 in the superconducting state has also been a subject of theoretical debate @xcite . by considering the ac dynamics of superconducting vortices",
    ", a theory predicts the violation of the kohn s theorem and a peculiar temperature dependence of the resonance frequency in clean type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "experimentally , however , this point has not yet studied mainly because the observation of cr in the superconducting state is difficult due to the limitation of microwave penetration depth which is usually short . by using a @xmath18he microwave cavity we are able to observe cr in the sc phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "contrary to the proposed temperature dependence , we find that the mass does not show any significant change below @xmath19 .",
    "we rather find that the scattering rate at low temperatures exhibits characteristic temperature dependence ; it shows non - fermi liquid - like quasi @xmath20-linear dependence followed by a sudden decrease below the vortex - lattice melting transition temperature , which has been determined by the resistivity measurements@xcite .",
    "this supports the formation of a coherent quasiparticle bloch state in the vortex lattice phase .",
    "high - quality single crystals of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 used in this study were grown by the czochralski pulling method and applying the solid state electro - transport method under ultra - high vacuum @xcite .",
    "the very high residual - resistivity - ratio ( @xmath21 ) @xcite indicates that the impurity scattering rate is very low which is important for observation of cr .",
    "the cr experiments were carried out by using three different cylindrical cu cavities @xcite , whose resonance frequencies for the te@xmath22 mode are 28 , 45 , and 60ghz . for the 28-ghz cavity , we also use the te@xmath23 mode at 38ghz .",
    "the quality factors of the cavities are @xmath24 without the sample .",
    "the plate - like crystal with dimensions of @xmath25mm@xmath18 is placed at an antinode position of the microwave magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "the 28 and 45-ghz cavities have sapphire hot - fingers @xcite , which enables us to control the temperature of the sample with keeping the cavity temperature at the liquid @xmath27he temperature .",
    "the 45-ghz cavity has a @xmath18he pot system which can cool the sample to @xmath280.7 k. for the 60-ghz cavity measurements , the sample is placed by a sapphire rod attached to the cavity and the cavity temperature is varied .",
    "the frequency response of the cavity is measured by a scalar network analyzer , and the microwave loss @xmath29 and resonant frequency @xmath15 are recorded as a function of dc field @xmath30 with and without the sample .",
    "the dc magnetic field @xmath31 is applied perpendicular to the alternating currents @xmath32 induced by microwave [ fig.[fig : ho](a ) ] . in a classical picture , the electrons undergo cyclotron motion with velocity perpendicular to @xmath31 and are accelerated by the microwave .",
    "the field - angle is controlled by manually rotating the sample at room temperature .",
    "the changes in @xmath33 and @xmath34 as a function of dc field @xmath30 show the multiple cyclotron resonances [ fig.[fig : ho](b ) ] .",
    "the cr occurs near the surface within the microwave skin depth @xmath35 ( @xmath36 m for 28ghz at 1.7k where the dc resistivity @xmath37 is @xmath38 cm in our crystal ) when the frequency of the cyclotron motion coincides with the microwave frequency .",
    "we note that unlike conventional cr in metals @xcite , heavy mass and small carriers ( namely , slow fermi velocity @xmath39 ) in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 result in that the cyclotron radius @xmath40 may become shorter than @xmath41 in our measurement frequency range .",
    "electronic band - structure is calculated in two steps .",
    "first , the _ ab initio _ calculations are performed for the paramagnetic state of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 by using the wien2k package @xcite , in which the relativistic full - potential ( linearized ) augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) @xmath42 local orbitals method is implemented .",
    "the crystallographical parameters are the space group no.139 , @xmath43 , the lattice constants , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and si internal position , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "then the fermi surface in the antiferromagnetic state was obtained by applying several values of effective field , and the brillouin zone is folded to the space group no.123 , @xmath47 .",
    "the obtained fermi surface is essentially consistent with the previous density functional band - structure calculations @xcite .",
    "si@xmath0 . ( a ) schematic configuration of the microwave measurements . the crystal is placed inside the cavity , where the microwave field component @xmath48 has an antinode for the te@xmath22 and te@xmath23 modes .",
    "the dc field @xmath30 is applied parallel to @xmath26 , which excites the microwave current @xmath49 near the sample surface in the region characterized by the skin depth @xmath41 ( red shades ) .",
    "when the frequency of the cyclotron motion with a radius @xmath50 ( black loops ) coincides with the microwave frequency @xmath15 , the cyclotron resonance occurs .",

    "these results clearly indicate that the multiple resonances occur in this field range .",
    "these resonances show rapid broadening with increasing temperature [ fig.[fig : ho](c ) ] , which rules out the electron paramagnetic resonance as the origin of anomalies .",
    "measurements by using different cavities or different modes [ fig.[fig : ho](d ) ] clearly demonstrate that the resonance fields are proportional to the measurement frequency .",
    "all of these features establish that these anomalies are due to the cr .",
    "the observed seven cr lines are labelled as a to g in the order of corresponding @xmath10 from the heaviest [ figs.[fig : ho](d ) and [ fig : ho_cr ] ] .",

    "the dissipation is proportional to the real part of the complex conductivity @xmath66 , which is given by the drude model in a simple metal with the carrier number @xmath67 and effective mass @xmath68 @xcite : @xmath69 the real part is then given by @xmath70.\\ ] ] this is the sum of two lorentzian functions which have two peaks at @xmath71 with the width determined by @xmath72 .",
    "when the resonance peak is sharp enough ( @xmath73 ) , the contribution from the @xmath74 peak becomes negligible near the actual resonance at @xmath75 , and then the peak in @xmath65 can be approximated by the simple lorentzian @xmath76 where the normalized full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 .    from the normalized fwhm we estimate that @xmath79 reaches @xmath80 at low temperatures for the sharpest line d. in addition to the resonance peaks",
    ", the field dependent surface resistance contributes to @xmath65 as well .",
    "since uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is a compensated metal with equal volumes of electron and hole carries , the magnetoresistance is large at low temperatures for high - quality crystals with large @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this gives noticeable smooth background signals , as evident especially for 28ghz . to resolve the cyclotron resonance lines at high fields",
    ", we therefore subtract this background field dependence by using polynomial functions [ dashed lines in fig.[fig : ho_cr](a ) ] . for the resonance line",

    "it is clear that the cr lines d and a gradually split into two peaks when the field direction is rotated from the @xmath52 $ ] to @xmath57 $ ] direction .",
    "for the line a , the fwhm for finite azimuth angles @xmath81 is significantly broader than that of @xmath53 $ ] @xmath82 , suggesting that the split occurs immediately after the field rotation from the @xmath83 axis . on the other hand ,",
    "the field split occurs at larger angles for the line d. figure[fig : ho_cr](f ) shows the resonance lines at 60ghz when the field is inclined from @xmath57 $ ] toward @xmath58 $ ] direction .",
    "the split in line d survives against the field tilt angle @xmath84 from the basal plane toward the @xmath8 axis up to the largest tilt @xmath85 used in this study .",
    "figures[fig : ho_cr](d ) and ( e ) display the resonance lines at two different frequencies when the field is inclined from @xmath52 $ ] toward @xmath58 $ ] direction in the @xmath59 plane . the line d exhibits a gradual shift to higher fields with increasing tilt angle @xmath84 , whereas the lines b and b merge into a single peak for large @xmath84 .",
    "we also note that for the @xmath59 plane rotation , due to the limit of the field range we can not clearly identify the two - peak feature for the line a. thus we have large error bars for the line a at finite @xmath84 [ fig.[fig : ho_mass ] ] .",
    "the three - dimensional structure of fs mass in the hidden - order phase can be explored by the field - angle dependence of the cr lines , which is summarized in fig.[fig : ho_mass ] .",
    "the characteristic angle dependence of each cr line is important to assign the corresponding orbits in different fs pockets . among the observed cr lines , three lines a ( a ) ,",
    "b ( b ) , and d ( d ) exhibit strong intensities [ solid symbols in fig.[fig : ho_mass ] ] , which should come from the main fs pockets with relatively large volume .",
    "measurements of the strong lines b and d at two different frequencies provide quantitatively consistent masses , indicating that the mass is field independent at any angle within the measurement range of field .",
    "the sdh results indicate that the fs in the hidden - order phase is similar to that in the antiferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "thus we compare our cr results with the band structure calculations assuming the antiferromagnetism @xcite , and discuss the fs structure in the hidden - order phase .",
    "the fs structures calculated with several different values of effective field for antiferromagnetism are shown in fig.[fig : fs ] .",
    "the results in fig.[fig : fs](a ) are obtained with the effective field of 40mev , which corresponds to an antiferromagnetic gap of @xmath86mev when the renormalization of @xmath87 is taken into account . in this case there",
    "exists the cage structure which is absent in the previous calculation @xcite , but this structure is sensitive to the gap size .",
    "indeed we found that small energy shifts to this band ( 4 , 8 , and 12mev for figs.[fig : fs](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively ) can diminish this cage structure .",
    "thus our calculations are completely consistent with the previous case with a larger gap . in these calculations in the antiferromagnetic state",
    ", we always find main three non - equivalent fs pockets with relatively large volumes , labelled as @xmath1 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 [ figs.[fig : fs](a)-(d ) ] , which have obviously different shapes .",
    "below we show that the @xmath1 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 bands correspond to the three strong cr lines d ( d ) , b ( b ) and a ( a ) , respectively .",
    "the other lines with weaker intensities [ open symbols in fig.[fig : ho_mass ] ] are likely corresponding to the smaller pockets @xmath90 inside the @xmath1 pocket and hourglass - like small pocket near the @xmath91 point [ figs.[fig : fs](a)-(d ) and [ fig : ho_orbit](a ) ] , as well as the possible remnant pockets of the cage which can be found in some parameter range of antiferromagnetic gap [ figs.[fig : fs](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the @xmath1 pocket with nearly isotropic shape , which locates around the center of the folded brillouin zone ( @xmath92 point ) , has the largest volume and is the only hole bands among the main bands .",
    "according to the magneto - transport measurements , the hall coefficient is positive in the hidden - order phase @xcite , which immediately indicates that this hole band @xmath1 has much larger mobility than the electron bands in this compensated metal .",
    "this @xmath1 pocket is therefore responsible for the line d having the strongest intensity and sharpest fwhm ( with the largest @xmath79 ) .",
    "there are four @xmath88 electron pockets with hemispherical shape whose center is along the @xmath92-@xmath93 line .",
    "these pockets yield two different extremal orbits for @xmath94 $ ] , but these two become equivalent for @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "this uniquely corresponds to the angle dependence of the line b. this line b also tends to merge towards @xmath96 $ ] , which is fully consistent with the shape of @xmath88 pockets as well .",
    "the @xmath89 pockets around @xmath97 point have much heavier band mass with larger @xmath98 than the @xmath1 pocket [ figs.[fig : fs](a)-(d ) ] , which naturally leads us to assign the heaviest line a to the @xmath89 pockets .",
    "indeed , the @xmath89 fs consists of two crossing sheets , which should give two different orbits for in - plane fields except when the field is aligned exactly parallel to the @xmath52 $ ] direction as observed for line a. as for the @xmath59 rotation from @xmath52 $ ] to @xmath58 $ ] one expects the branch splitting for the @xmath89 pockets , but the large errors of mass determination for line a at finite @xmath84 prevent us from observing this split clearly .",
    "we stress , however , that no splitting in our sharpest line d for the @xmath59 rotation toward @xmath58 $ ] with much higher resolution is a clear indication that line d does not come from the @xmath89 band .",
    "our assignments for the @xmath1 and @xmath88 bands are consistent with the quantum oscillation reports @xcite , in which the largest amplitude oscillation branch is assigned to @xmath1 @xcite and the merging branches for @xmath52\\rightarrow [ 001]$ ] to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we note that different band assignments to the quantum oscillation branches have been proposed @xcite , in which the largest @xmath92-centered hole band is assigned to the @xmath99 branch observed only at very high fields above @xmath100 t @xcite .",
    "however , such a high - field branch is most likely associated with field - induced transition @xcite possibly due to the lifshitz topology change by the zeeman effect @xcite .",
    "it is rather reasonable to assign the most pronounced @xmath1 branch to this largest hole band , which is consistent with our assignments of cr lines .",
    "our cyclotron resonance reveals three strong lines which correspond to the main fs pockets including the heaviest electron band @xmath89 that has been missing in the quantum oscillation measurements .",

    "@xmath135 , one can see several different orbits , as shown in figs.[fig : ho_orbit](b)-(d ) , which provides a natural explanation for salient features observed in the quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "the breakdown near a @xmath58 $ ] pole of the @xmath1 sheet should decrease the effective oscillation frequency from @xmath128 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](b ) ] to @xmath136 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](c ) ] .",
    "this is caused by the reduced effective area of the cyclotron orbit with ` figure - eight ' topology , which is due to a combination of the @xmath1 hole pocket and the hourglass electron pocket @xcite .",
    "another set of breakdown near the other pole leads to the third frequency @xmath137 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](d ) ] .",
    "therefore the three - peak structure in the frequency spectrum with the @xmath81-independent separation @xmath131 between the peaks can be understood by this mechanism .",
    "this also explains the fact that the reduced frequency branches @xmath136 and @xmath137 disappear once the field direction is inclined from the @xmath56 plane , because for such fields the orbits have large separation between the @xmath1 and hourglass pockets .",
    "the breakdown probability of each orbits is @xmath125 for @xmath128 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](b ) ] , @xmath138 for @xmath136 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](c ) ] and @xmath139 for @xmath137 [ fig.[fig : ho_orbit](d ) ] .",
    "the normalized field dependence of the breakdown probability is shown in fig.[fig : ho_orbit](e ) . from comparisons between these damping factors and quantum oscillation fft amplitude in the field range from 8 to 15 t @xcite",
    ", we estimate the breakdown field @xmath127 of the order of @xmath140 t .",
    "figure[fig : ho_orbit](e ) also shows that in the high field range above @xmath141 , the damping factors of three orbits are of the same order and their ratios have no significant dependence of magnetic field , which also seems to be consistent with the quantum oscillation experiments",
    ".    the size of the hourglass pocket and hence the magnitude of @xmath131 may be sensitive to the details of band - structure calculations , but the present fs in fig.[fig : ho_orbit](a ) gives @xmath142kt , which is the same order as the experimental observations .",
    "recent band - structure calculations suggest that the shape of the @xmath1 sheet near the poles in the hidden - order phase are sensitive to the order parameters @xcite , which may affect the probability of the breakdown at the field range used in the quantum oscillation studies .",
    "we stress that our newly found branch splitting of the cyclotron resonance is not originated from this breakdown effect , because our field range ( @xmath143 t for the @xmath1 band at 28ghz ) should be lower than the breakdown field @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the angle dependence of the cyclotron resonance is quite different from the three - peak behavior in the quantum oscillations .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the fs shape of the hole @xmath1 band is nearly spherical , and that the cr mass split results from the peculiar in - plane mass anisotropy which is not directly related to the shape of fs .",
    "( in other words , the slope of the energy - momentum dispersion at the @xmath1 fs is different for different directions while the size of fermi momentum remains nearly the same [ see fig.[fig : ho_mass_alpha](b ) ] . )",
    "we also note that for the mass determination the cyclotron resonance in a high - quality crystal with large @xmath79 ( @xmath80 in our case ) can yield a much higher resolution than the quantum oscillation measurements , which require the analysis of temperature dependent oscillation amplitude .",

    "of the @xmath1 band . ( a ) @xmath10 of the @xmath1 band as a function of the field angle at 28 and 60 ghz .",
    "we use the data for @xmath144 and @xmath145 and symmetrize them for other angles .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are the guides for the eyes representing two domains .",

    "red area represents heavy spots . for each domain , two orbits for @xmath147 , @xmath148 ( pink ) and @xmath147 , @xmath85 ( red ) are depicted .",
    "( b ) for the @xmath57 $ ] domain schematic dispersion curves are shown along the two directions . ]      now we focus on the signature of the fs that provides a key to understanding the ho .",
    "the most unexpected and important result is that the sharpest line d arising from the @xmath1 hole pocket is clearly split into two lines with nearly equal intensities near the @xmath57 $ ] direction [ figs.[fig : ho_cr](a ) , ( c ) , ( f ) and [ fig : ho_mass ] ] .",
    "this splitting in the @xmath1 hole pocket is hardly explained from the calculated fs structure in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "one may argue that some small warping of fs shape gives rise to the appearance of an additional extremal orbit for particular angles , which can result in the splitting .",
    "however , such a scenario is highly unlikely because of the following reasons .",
    "first , quantum oscillation measurements clearly indicate that the number of extremal orbits in the @xmath57 $ ] direction remains the same as that in @xmath52 $ ] direction @xcite .",
    "this argues against that the additional orbit appears only near the @xmath57 $ ] direction .",
    "second , the band - structure calculation indicates that @xmath1 pocket is nearly spherical , which is supported by the quantum oscillations experiments @xcite that reveal almost angle - independent oscillation frequency for this band .",
    "third , the fact that the integrated intensity of the split line d is nearly equal to that of d line in a wide range of angle [ figs.[fig : ho_cr](a ) , ( c ) and ( f ) ] suggests that both cr lines arise from the orbits with nearly equal fs cross sections , which is at odds with the warping scenario .",
    "therefore we infer that the observed splitting of the cr line d results from a peculiar mass structure in the ho phase .",
    "the observed splitting of the sharpest cr line d near the @xmath57 $ ] direction can be naturally explained by the emergence of the heavy spots in the @xmath1 band along @xmath57 $ ] as depicted in fig.[fig : ho_mass_alpha ] .",
    "one may consider such a twofold mass anisotropy if the system breaks the fourfold symmetry as suggested by the magnetic torque experiments @xcite .",
    "the twofold symmetry also leads to the formation of domains with different nematic directions , which can be called as @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath146 $ ] domains as shown in the insets of fig.[fig : ho_mass_alpha](a ) .",
    "in large crystals containing these two domains we expect to have two different orbits with different cyclotron masses near the @xmath57 $ ] and equivalent directions .",
    "this can explain the observed splitting of the cyclotron mass near @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "the robustness against field tilting can also be explained because the cyclotron orbit for one of the domains always goes through the heavy spots as shown by the red arrow in the inset of fig.[fig : ho_mass_alpha](a ) .",
    "the fact that the quantum oscillation frequency for the @xmath1 band does not show the corresponding splitting for tilted fields indicates that the fs shape does not show significant breaking of fourfold symmetry but only mass structure strongly breaks the rotational symmetry .",
    "this suggests that the twofold symmetry is related to the correlation effect , which modifies mainly the curvature of band dispersion near the fermi energy [ fig.[fig : ho_mass_alpha](b ) ] .",

    ", the four hemispherical @xmath88 pockets may rotate or elongate towards each directions indicated by the black arrows .",
    "this symmetry breaking changes the nesting conditions between the @xmath88 and @xmath1 pockets connected with the incommensurate wave vectors @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( dashed arrows ) , and the interband quasiparticle scattering rates shown by the green and red arrows become non - equivalent . ]    a close look at the split resonance lines in fig.[fig : ho_split ] reveals that the fwhm for the heavier line ( at higher field ) is always larger than the lighter line in our measurement temperature range .",
    "we note that the integrated intensities for these two cr lines are almost identical , which is reproducible when the field direction is rotated by @xmath154 .",
    "this implies that the two domains have almost identical volumes in the large crystal used in this study .",
    "we also find that the data taken after the field cooling condition at 12 t remains unchanged , which is consistent with the previous torque experiments @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the domains are pinned by the underling lattice conditions .",
    "an important result is that the magnitude of @xmath155 estimated from the width of the lorentzian fits is smaller for the heavier resonance line .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the elastic impurity scattering time is longer for heavier band , because of the impurity limited mean free path at very low temperatures . in our case , however , the opposite trend has been observed , implying that the inelastic scattering rate @xmath72 is enhanced for the heavier cyclotron orbit .",
    "this is supported by the higher temperature data [ fig.[fig : ho_split](b ) ] , where the fwhm of the heavier cr line shows more broadening , indicating stronger temperature dependence of inelastic scattering rate @xmath156 near the heavy spots .    to discuss possible origins of the enhanced inelastic scattering at the heavy spots ,",
    "it is important to consider the interband scattering between the fermi surface points connected with particular wave vectors characteristic to the hidden - order phase .",
    "it has been shown from the neutron scattering experiments @xcite that the excitations at the commensurate @xmath157 and incommensurate @xmath158 wave vectors are important in the hidden - order phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 . as schematically shown in fig.[fig : ho_spot ] , there are parts of @xmath1 and @xmath88 pockets connected approximately by @xmath159 @xcite . in the ho phase , the fs has twofold symmetry ( rather than fourfold tetragonal symmetry ) along the @xmath57 $ ] direction , and the four @xmath88 pockets can be slightly rotated ( or elongated ) along this direction .",
    "this leads to an imbalance in the interband interactions as depicted by the green and red dashed arrows in fig.[fig : ho_spot ] .",
    "this imbalance may enhance the inelastic scattering at the two of the four corners of the @xmath1 hole pocket , generating the hot spots along the @xmath57 $ ] ( or @xmath160 $ ] ) direction in the @xmath1 sheet as revealed in the present cr experiments .     and surface reactance @xmath161 at 45 ghz in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 at zero field .",

    "next we discuss the results in the superconducting state , which have been obtained by using 45-ghz cavity with @xmath18he pot . to check the superconducting transition we measure the temperature dependence of the surface impedance ( @xmath163 ) at zero and finite magnetic fields . in the condition",
    "that the skin depth @xmath41 is smaller than sample dimensions , the change in the microwave power dissipation @xmath55 and the frequency shift @xmath34 are proportional to the surface resistance @xmath164 and the change of the surface reactance @xmath165 , respectively @xcite . in many superconductors ,",
    "the normal - state microwave electrodynamics is described by the hagen - rubens limit @xmath166 , in which the surface resistance and reactance have the simple form @xmath167 however , in the present case @xmath168 becomes large and the hagen - rubens limit is not satisfied at low temperatures .",
    "indeed the temperature dependence of @xmath161 deviates from that of @xmath164 even above @xmath162 , as shown in fig.[fig : sc](a ) .",
    "similar deviations have been observed , for example , in the kondo semiconductor cenisn , where the gap formation reduces the scattering leading to @xmath169 at low temperatures@xcite .",

    "the latter enhancement is not usually seen in superconductors , because @xmath161 in the sc state can be approximately given by the magnetic penetration depth @xmath170 as @xmath171 when @xmath172 is much shorter than the skin depth @xmath41 . in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , however , the small number and heavy mass of carriers result in very long penetration depth @xmath173 m @xcite , which is longer than the skin depth @xmath174 m at 45ghz in our ultraclean crystals . under magnetic fields ,",
    "we observe essentially similar behaviours in the temperature dependence of @xmath175 [ figs.[fig : sc](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the deviation between @xmath176 and @xmath177 is observed in the normal state , which is enhanced in the sc state .",
    "previous measurements of electrical and thermal conductivities in fields @xcite have provided evidence for the existence of extended region of vortex liquid state , where the resistivity is still finite even in the sc state below the mean - field transition temperature @xmath162 . in the vortex solid state below the melting temperature @xmath178 ,",
    "the resistivity becomes zero and the thermal conductivity shows an enhancement @xcite . by a comparison with the reported vortex phase diagram [ fig.[fig : sc](d ) ] , we find that the deviation between @xmath176 and @xmath177 becomes much enhanced below @xmath178 in the vortex solid state .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath33 for @xmath94 $ ] at 45ghz shows multiple cr lines , which persist down to the lowest temperature at 0.7k [ figs.[fig : sc_cr](a ) and ( b ) ] . at this temperature 0.7k ,",
    "the upper critical field @xmath179 and vortex - lattice melting field @xmath180 for @xmath94 $ ] are 11 and 7 t respectively @xcite .",
    "thus we focus on the resonance lines at low fields , labelled as d , e , f , and g. the surface impedance results in fig.[fig : sc ] clearly indicate that we cover the field and temperature range deep in the sc state , and thus for these lines the observed clear peaks in the sc state below @xmath162 can be considered as the first observation of the cr in the sc phase of heavy - fermion materials .",
    "the temperature dependence of the cyclotron masses @xmath10 for these lines , which are determined by the resonance fields , is plotted in fig.[fig_sc_mass ] . within experimental error , the masses are temperature independent , and we find that they do not exhibit any noticeable change between the ho and sc phases .",
    "theoretically , in clean type - ii superconductors , it has been shown @xcite that the presence of superconducting and normal carriers in the vortex states leads to the violation of kohn s theorem , and the temperature dependence of the superconducting carrier number results in a peculiar temperature dependence of the cyclotron frequency . in the present case , however , such temperature dependence is not observed .",
    "one possible reason for this difference is that in this multiband system , the kohn s theorem is already violated in the normal state above @xmath162 , which may alter the description of cr in the vortex state .",
    "further studies are necessary for the understanding of cr in heavy - fermion and multiband superconductors .",
    "a close look at the temperature dependence of the resonance line shape in figs.[fig : sc_cr](a ) and ( b ) finds that the fwhm of the cr lines become broader with increasing temperature .",
    "we analyze the data by the lorentzian fits to extract the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath72 , which is shown in fig.[fig_sc_tau ] . in the normal state above",
    "@xmath162 the scattering rate roughly follows @xmath20-linear dependence , which suggests the deviation from the standard fermi - liquid theory of metals .",
    "such non-@xmath181 dependence of scattering can also be found in the transport measurements of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite .    in the sc state below @xmath182 , we observe that the scattering rate is suppressed not at @xmath182 , but below the vortex - lattice melting transition temperature @xmath178 for all four lines d - g [ figs.[fig_sc_tau](a)-(d ) ] .",
    "such a suppression below @xmath178 is consistent with the reported enhancement of thermal conductivity below @xmath178 , and provides further evidence that the vortex solid state has much less scattering than the vortex liquid state . in very clean systems the vortices form a regular lattice in the solid state , which can act as a periodic potential for quasiparticles .",
    "in such a case , the formation of a bloch - like state may be expected , where the quasiparticle scattering is reduced compared with the vortex liquid state having more disordered potentials .",
    "thus our observation provides a strong support for the formation of the quasiparticle bloch state in vortex - lattice state of clean superconductors .",
    "extracted from the cr line width at 45 and 60ghz for cr lines d ( a ) , e ( b ) , f ( c ) , and g ( d ) .",
    "corresponding vortex liquid ( blue shade ) and vortex solid ( red shade ) states for 45ghz are determined from the phase diagram in ref .. ]    we also note that the dhva measurements @xcite have shown that the dingle temperature @xmath183 , which is proportional to the scattering rate , increases when the field is reduced below the upper critical field at very low temperatures @xmath184mk . in this low temperature range , the upper critical field is suggested to be of first order @xcite , and the boundary between the vortex liquid and solid states is not fully resolved .",
    "this result can be explained by the enhanced scattering due to the andreev reflection occurred at the boundary between the sc and normal ( vortex core ) regions in the vortex liquid state just below @xmath179 .",
    "this implies that there is sizeable vortex liquid region even in the low - temperature limit , where thermal fluctuations vanish .",
    "such a possible quantum vortex liquid state , where quantum fluctuations melt the vortex lattice , has been suggested in organic and cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "it deserves further studies to determine the complete phase diagram down to the low temperature limit .",
    "we have shown that the observation of cr in the ho and sc states of uru@xmath0si@xmath0 provides useful information of the quasiparticle mass and scattering rate .    in the ho phase ,",
    "we have determined the angle - dependent mass structure , which is compared with the band - structure calculations assuming the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "we were able to assign the three cr lines with strong intensities with the main fermi surface pockets , from which a reasonable estimate of electronic specific heat coefficient can be obtained . in the sharpest cr line corresponding to the hole @xmath1 pocket",
    ", we observed anomalous splitting near the @xmath57 $ ] direction , which is not expected in the calculations for antiferromagnetic state .",
    "this splitting is found to be robust against the field tilting from the basal plane , which clearly indicates that the cr splitting has a different origin from the threefold splitting of the quantum oscillation frequency observed only near the in - plane direction . by considering the fermi - surface structure",
    "we propose the magnetic breakdown at high fields as a possible origin of the quantum oscillation splitting .",
    "the cr splitting can be naturally explained if we consider the twofold in - plane anisotropy of the mass and the formation of micro - domains , which is consistent with the broken rotational fourfold symmetry suggested by the magnetic torque experiments @xcite .",
    "recent nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments have reported the peculiar in - plain anisotropy of the si nmr line width , which also supports the twofold anisotropy elongated along the @xmath57 $ ] direction @xcite . moreover , very recent high - resolution synchrotron x - ray measurements have revealed evidence for structural change from the tetragonal @xmath43 to orthorhombic @xmath185-type symmetry @xcite , which is also consistent with the broken fourfold symmetry . from the scattering rate analysis",
    ", we find that the anisotropic in - plane mass structure involves the hot spots with heavy mass and large scattering rate , which suggests strong momentum dependence of electron correlations due to interband scattering .",
    "the broken fourfold symmetry gives strong constraints on the symmetry of the order parameter in the ho phase . in the symmetry classification of the multipole order @xcite ,",
    "this is consistent with the two - dimensional @xmath186 representations . along this line , rank-2 quadrupole with @xmath187 symmetry @xcite , and rank-3 octupole @xcite and rank-5 dotriacontapole with @xmath188 symmetry @xcite have been theoretically proposed , where the superscript @xmath42 or @xmath189 denotes the parity with respect to time reversal .",
    "more exotic nematic or hastatic states with and without time reversal symmetry breaking have also been proposed @xcite , which are also consistent with the broken fourfold symmetry . to pin down the genuine ho parameter , the next important step would be to identify whether time reversal symmetry is broken or not @xcite .",
