    "the exponential scale length of a galaxy disk is one of the most fundamental parameters to determine its morphological structure as well as to model its dynamics , and the fact that the light distributions are exponential makes it possible to constrain the formation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the scale length determines how the stars are distributed throughout a disk , and can be used to derive its mass distribution , assuming a specific m / l ratio .",
    "ultimately , this mass distribution is the primary constraint for determining the formation scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the scale length value is intimately connected to the circular velocity of the galaxy halo , which in turn relates closely to the angular momentum of the halo in which the disk is formed @xcite . up to the last few years",
    ", cosmological simulations were limited to rather low resolution , were disks and spheroids were barely resolved , and generally limited to high redshifts , so reproducing realistic disk scale lengths for modern galaxies was clearly out of reach .",

    "these processes form the basis of a galaxy s gravitational potential , and determine the strength of gravitational perturbations , the location of resonances in the disk , the formation and evolution of spiral arms and bars , kinematically decoupled components in centres of galaxies , and the dynamical feeding of circumnuclear starbursts and nuclear activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the first issue that arises at this point is the fact that sdss services provides users with the disk scale length as well as de vaucouleurs effective radius for each galaxy ( in all bands ) , and that , in principle , these values could be used to carry out our analysis . in fig .  [ fig : rddev ] , we show that the values provided by the sdss services show anomalies that are beyond our satisfaction for carrying out our analysis .",
    "the plot shows peculiar systematic effects in their derivation of the de vaucouleurs radii and scale lengths around some discrete values marked by the overdensities , the source and explanations for which we can not find .",
    "we thus decide to re - calculate the scale lengths .",
    "to derive the disk scale length , we use some important parameters provided by the sdss in order to constrain galaxy geometry as well as the location of the sky region .",

    "our scale length derivation routine uses standard idl routines , though due to license limitations this code can only be executed once , and hence is estimated to take a long time to run .",
    "using one single idl session , we would need 47 days to derive the scale lengths for the entire sample , thus in order to speed up the process , we decided to run this computation on a cluster of machines located at centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg cds .",
    "since the freely available idl virtual machine does not allow one to launch batch queries , and since installing an idl licence on each cluster node was not an option , we used the open source clone of idl , gnu data language gdl @xcite .",
    "we found out that a few idl functions were either missing or behaving improperly , thus requiring minor tweaking in our code . then , we ran both idl and gdl code on the same subset of sdss images , in order to check the reliability of the gdl output .",
    "once the gdl code was installed on each node of the cluster , the 56096 sdss images were put to an irods installation deployed at cds .",
    "finally , the scale length computation was launched on the cluster , using the following architecture :    1 .",
    "a java program holds the list of galaxies to process , and - for each object of this list - sends a message to the cluster , asking to spawn a new job ( i.e. , launch the corresponding computation ) .",
    "2 .   the cluster master node receives the request , and dispatches it to the cluster node with the smallest cpu load .",
    "the cluster node then downloads from irods the @xmath34 images corresponding to the galaxy to process , runs the gdl code , and sends back the computed result to irods .",
    "4 .   if the computation fails , it will be re - sent to another node until success    the cds cluster has proven to be very stable and reliable , though some problems were found in the dispatching algorithm , resulting sometimes in overloading some of the nodes while some others were idle .",
    "four nodes of the cluster were dedicated to our computation . as the total computation time is roughly proportional to the number of involved nodes , allocating ten times more nodes",
    "would have decreased this time by a factor ten .",
    "this would only be true if the computation service were to be close to the data , so that the transfer time would be negligible with respect to the computation time . in theory , on the cds cluster , with four dedicated nodes",
    ", we should have been able to process 11200 galaxies per day , however in reality , the cluster only processed between 8500 and 9000 galaxies per day , which could be explained by some inefficiency in the dispatching algorithm .",
    "to conclude , using the cds , we have been able to derive the scale lengths for all 56090 galaxies in all five sdss bands in less than a week .",
    "the procedure to derive scale length and calculate asymmetry parameters from the sdss images is illustrated in fig .",

    "* man - made satellites passing too close to the galaxy position .",
    "saturated stars near the objects can not be masked properly using sextractor ( due to undetermined source radii ) .",

    "the small overlap is partly due to the fact that around half of the objects in @xcite are early - type galaxies ( rc3 type @xmath78 ) , and partly since it is essentially the overlap between the leda sample and that of @xcite .",
    "moreover , our sample has an upper limit for the galaxy sizes due to our preferred strategy for using skyview ( see section  [ sec : sample ] )",
    ". from this sample of 283 galaxies , only 45 galaxies have been accurately classified ( their t error @xmath79 ) in @xcite .",
    "for these objects , we find weak correlation between the morphological classification from leda and those from @xcite . in a similar fashion to @xcite",
    ", we define the _ `` inverse '' _ concentration parameter as the ratio between the radii containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian flux respectively , @xmath80 provided by the sdss services . as a consistency check ,",
    "we ensure that we reproduce fig .",
    "10 of @xcite , i.e. , that morphological classification provided by leda correlates with concentration parameter .",
    "furthermore , we find that although the vast majority of our sample have very large morphological classification uncertainties ( t error @xmath81 ) , the concentration parameters that we calculate for all 30374 galaxies indicate that , in agreement with @xcite , they are disk galaxies .    regarding the correlation of the concentration parameter with morphological type , for the 309 well - classified galaxies @xmath82 , and for the full sample @xmath83 .",
    "although we find these values unconvincing as firm correlations , we acknowledge a clear trend that concentration parameter is increasing with galaxy morphological type . likewise , the spread of points in asymmetry - type and velocity dispersion - type diagrams are very large , and the coefficients of determination even lower than that of the concentration parameter , however , here also the trend is acknowledged .",
    "given that robust morphological classification is known only for a very small subset of our entire sample , we invoke other parameters in order to be able to further investigate the scale lengths for the full sample . following the above arguments , and their consistency with the previous findings by , e.g. , @xcite , and",
    "@xcite we find it instructive to invoke these parameters as type indicators ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : typecasigma ] ) .",
    "for example , we find that the asymmetry parameter correlates with type @xmath29 as @xmath84 , put this into the graph , however , the  varies between 0.050.81 depending on bin and choice of sub sample and parameter , with the best correlation for unjustified binning applied . for this reason , we do not quote the errors or mathematical formulation for how @xmath50 , @xmath85 , or velocity dispersion , vary with type , but take these trends as a indications and further investigate how scale length depends on these parameters as morphological type indicators .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : casigma ] , we plot the scale lengths versus asymmetry , concentration , and velocity dispersion .",
    "although it is shown that scale length decreases at higher concentration parameter , a line - fitting exercise reveals @xmath86 , which implies insignificant correlation .",
    "the velocity dispersion has a higher correlation , @xmath87 , but still with no strong statistical significance .",
    "moreover , the large scatter of the scale length values illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : casigma ] is consistent with the galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "this exercise tells us , firstly , that asymmetry , concentration , and velocity dispersion only correlate weakly with morphological type , and secondly , that even when using these parameters as morphological type indicators , there is no strong change in disk scale length for different galaxy types .",
    "furthermore , we have now been able to use the full sample of 30374 galaxies with reliable scale lengths .",
    "the derived scale lengths can be compared between the images in different bands to investigate the effects of dust and stellar populations in disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such analysis is complementary to the results on colour gradients used to analyse age gradients in disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and many more ) .",
    "we analyse the derived scale lengths in different bands applying the limits presented in table  [ tab : ugriz ] .",
    "we can then compare for a given subset , where reliable scale lengths have been derived in two bands , how the scale length changes between different sdss bands .",
    "we derive a series of correlations between the scale lengths in different bands , and although not all band - pair samples are of equal size , we find that the correlations for all the pairs are significant ( see equations ( 3)(12 ) , where all formal errors and coefficients of determination are given ) .",
    "@xmath89    although scale lengths derived from different sdss bands do not show significant differences , their general trends are as predicted by @xcite . typically , the correlations are very strong , and in almost all bands , the corresponding average scale lengths are comparable : @xmath90 kpc ,   @xmath91 kpc ,   @xmath92 kpc ,   @xmath93 kpc ,   @xmath94 kpc .    we further find that these numbers are consistent with , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who presented an extensive analysis of deep images of 349 , 86 , and 45 spiral galaxies , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the sample of @xcite is a sample of edge - on galaxies , which explains the relatively insignificant variations found in our analysis , as opposed to theirs . also , their wavelength range , from b to k , is larger than with sdss data . in an attempt to extend these results to compare with near - infrared results ,",
    "we also cross - correlated our sample with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xmath95-band images .",
    "we applied the code presented in section  [ sec : scalelengths ] and found the 2mass images are too shallow to yield anything presentable .",
    "-band absolute magnitude derived from the sdss apparent @xmath0-band magnitude .",
    "the histogram and the scatter plot illustrate the same mass range . ]",
    "we retrieve stellar masses for our sample galaxies by cross matching our sample with the publically available sample of @xcite and @xcite , and find stellar masses for 30126 ( i.e. , almost all our sample ) galaxies .",
    "these authors have calculated total stellar masses for nearly a million sdss galaxies based on photometry of the outer regions of the galaxies with models that produce dust corrected star formation rates and use upgraded stellar population synthesis spectra for the continuum subtraction . as noted by these authors , comparison between the stellar masses derived from photometry and spectra from the central regions",
    "show that the fits to the photometry are more constrained at low mass since the emission line contribution makes the line index fits less well - constrained . since the spectroscopic masses are based on fibre spectra from sdss , which cover only a fraction of the galaxies",
    ", we opt to use the stellar masses from photometry .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd_mass ] we illustrate the scale length as a function of total stellar mass , and find that larger mass galaxies have larger scale lengths .",
    "moreover , we find that this increase is accompanied by a larger spread in scale length .",
    "galaxies with total stellar mass less than @xmath96 have average @xmath0-band scale length of @xmath97 pc , galaxies with total stellar mass between @xmath98 and @xmath6 have average scale length of @xmath4 kpc , and galaxies with total stellar mass between @xmath8 and @xmath9 have average scale length of @xmath7 kpc .",
    "all points in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd_mass ] are also color coded to show the consistently increasing intrinsic absolute magnitude for larger stellar mass galaxies .",
    "we have derived reliable scale lengths for 30374 disk / spiral galaxies , with no sign of ongoing interaction or disturbed morphology , in all five @xmath99 and @xmath13-bands from sdss dr6 images .",
    "cross - correlation of the sdss sample with the leda catalogue has enabled us to investigate the variation of the scale lengths for different types of disk / spiral galaxies .",
    "although the typical scale length in @xmath10-band is 35% larger than that in the @xmath0-band , the scale lengths in the @xmath100 and @xmath13-bands are similar and only become smaller on the average for late morphological types .",
    "this result remains consistent when using by - eye morphological classification or when using asymmetry parameter , concentration parameter , or velocity dispersion as an indicator for galaxy morphological type .",
    "our sample spans a range of total stellar masses between @xmath101 and @xmath102 with a typical galaxy mass of @xmath103 , and shows that the while scale length increases for more massive galaxies , the scale length spread also increases with galaxy mass .",
    "overall , these results are in full agreement with the recent work by @xcite .    scale length variations between bands are commonly studied to better understand the content and distribution of different stellar populations , metals , and/or dust .",
    "a colour gradient is expected to increase from early - type spirals to late - type spirals , mainly due to extinction , which increases to later types . however ,",
    "for scd galaxies or later the colour gradient becomes smaller , because of decreasing amount of extinction ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "changes in galaxy scale length in different wavelengths can be attributed to extinction by moderate amounts of dust , with radial metallicity and age gradients as other contributing factors @xcite .",
    "all these parameters will probably change as a function of redshift , enabling us to measure the variation of intrinsic scale length with cosmological epoch .",
    "it is expected that the opacity of disk galaxies is expected to have been systematically higher in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that the observed radial colour vary little suggests strongly that stellar population effects are not important here .",
    "dust effects are studied by using radiative transfer models which take into account scattering as well as absorption by dust , and observationally by investigating the scale length ratio in different bands as a function of inclination , i.e. , optical depth . however , there are some degeneracies .",
    "any tendency of the stars in the outer parts of disks to be bluer would tend to result in underestimated dust content .",
    "any tendency of the dust to concentrate towards the centre would result in an overestimate of the bluer scale lengths , and would not be distinguishable photometrically from a tendency of the stars in the outer disc to be bluer ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found that scale length ratios could change , due to stellar population changes , by a factor of approximately 1.1 - 1.2 from blue to near - infrared ( @xmath104-band ) .",
    "this would correspond to a factor of about 1.03 - 1.06 from @xmath11 to @xmath13 .",
    "since these numbers are very small , a very accurate analysis is needed to derive conclusions from the sdss database .",
    "our results seem to first order in agreement with these numbers .",
    "the derived scale lenghts and our presentation of the transformation coefficients for converting observed scale lengths from one sdss band to another , furthermore , are meant to be useful tools to test the results of cosmological galaxy formation models , whether numerical , or semi - analytical .    in the future ,",
    "we plan to add the stored parameters form the galaxy zoo project to obtain a larger sample with morphological classifications ( at this stage , detailed morphologies are not available ) , but also compare scale length as a function environment , nuclear activity , and colour gradients ( e.g. , comparing the sample with that of * ? ? ?",
    "many more parameters can be further investigated , and with the data and the derived parameters at hand , we now have the capability to continue this project in various and potentially unforeseeable directions .",
