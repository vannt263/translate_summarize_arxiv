    "a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) consists of a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) in orbit around a non - degenerate massive ( ob type ) star .",
    "x - ray emission is the result of accretion of material onto the compact object from the massive companion . the hmxb s can be divided into those with supergiant companions , and those with be star companions . a be star",

    "this balmer emission , along with a significant infrared excess is believed to originate in the circumstellar material which forms a disc around the star .",
    "the x - ray emission in these systems is transient in nature , as the orbit is wide and eccentric , and the neutron star passes through the densest regions of the circumstellar disc at periastron only . in the supergiant systems , the companion fills or is close to filling its roche lobe , and mass transfer occurs through roche lobe overflow or via a strong stellar wind removing @xmath210@xmath3m@xmath4y@xmath5 .",
    "these systems tend to be more persistent than the be / x - ray binaries , sometimes showing flaring events on short timescales ( for a comprehensive review of x - ray binaries , see lewin , van paradijs & van den heuvel 1995 . )",

    "1978 ; pakull 1989 ; schmidtke et al . 1994 ) .",
    "clark et al . ( 1978 ) attribute the higher luminosities to the lower metal abundance of the mc s , whilst pakull ( 1989 ) refers to evolutionary scenarios of van den heuvel & habets ( 1984 ) and de kool et al ( 1987 ) which appear to favour black hole formation in low metal abundance environments .    in order to study the differences between the hmxb populations of the magellanic clouds and the galaxy ,",

    "the low resolution spectrum in figure  [ h0544_low ] shows also weak h@xmath21 emission with ew(h@xmath21 ) = -0.7@xmath70.5   .    to the authors knowledge ,",
    "these observations represent the first detection of emission lines in the spectrum of this star .",
    "we confirm a lmc be star nature and , due to the lack of other emission line objects in or near the x - ray error circle , we conclude that this star is the optical counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "0.90    the number of be / x - ray binary systems known in the magellanic clouds is now increased to 12 in the smc and 7 in the lmc .",
    "these numbers compare with 29 known in our own galaxy .",
    "scaling simply by mass , we should expect the number of be / x - ray binaries in the lmc and smc to be 0.1 and 0.01 times the number in the galaxy respectively .",
    "in fact we find , especially in the smc , what appears at first to be an abnormally large be / x - ray binary population .",
    "the discrepancy might be explained through consideration of a number of issues :    \\a ) studies of cluster populations in the smc have shown a higher proportion of be stars amongst early type stars than in the galaxy ; this may be due to the effects of metallicity on a radiatively driven wind .",
    "if a higher proportion of b type stars in the smc have circumstellar envelopes , then for a given population of b star / neutron star binaries , more smc systems would be accreting x - ray systems .",
    "\\b ) the star formation history of the smc may have resulted in a hump in the stellar age distribution such that a higher proportion of smc stars are of the appropriate age to have evolved into be / x - ray binary systems .",
    "such a scenario would require an increase in star formation activity @xmath25 years ago .",
    "supporting evidence for such an effect comes from the hi work of staveley - smith et al ( 1997 ) who deduce from studies of six expanding shells in the smc a dynamical age of 5.4myr .",
    "they conclude that there must have been an exceptional degree of coherent star formation throughout the smc at this time .",
    "the photometric method used to identify be star candidates has proved succesful . in each case where spectroscopic observations have been made , the be star nature of the object has been confirmed .",
    "the strength of this approach is illustrated by figure  [ ew_rh ] which shows the relationship between the measured r ",
    "h@xmath1 index from photometric data and the ew(h@xmath1 ) of each object for which both such data were available .",
    "there appears to be a direct correlation , with the exception of one possible point  that of rx j0101.0 - 7321 .",
    "this seemingly anomalous point may be explained by variability , as the photometric and spectroscopic observations were made over 1 year apart .",
    "the indication then is that the be star counterpart in this system underwent some change between 1996 october and 1998 february , which resulted in a large increase in the amount of circumstellar material .",
    "apart from this kind of inherent difficulty , this approach is clearly an excellent method for identifying the counterparts to high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "in addition , one must be careful when examining so many fields of the chance probability of finding a be star unrelated to the x - ray source .",
    "from the 5 fields presented here , a total of 28 objects were found lying within twice the error circle radius with an h@xmath1 index of ( r - h@xmath1)@xmath230.2 .",
    "the total area covered by this sample is 103,000 sq .",
    "this gives an average be star rate of almost exactly 1 per sq .",
    "arcmin , so clearly one has to be careful when working with arc minute size error circles ( i.e. rx j0032.9 - 7348 in this work ) . ultimately , either the error circles have to be reduced by a significant factor , or simultaneous variability observed between the x - ray and the optical / ir band , before definite confirmation of the counterpart is established .",
    "we have identified several x - ray sources with be stars in the small magellanic cloud and demonstrated a reliable technique for doing so .",
    "the exceptionally large number of these systems in the smc can probably be attributed to an unusally large amount of star formation @xmath25 years ago .",
