    "<S> a self - interacting polymer with one end attached to a sticky surface has been studied by means of a flat - histogram stochastic growth algorithm known as flatperm . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the four - dimensional parameter space of the number of monomers up to 91 , self - attraction , surface attraction and force applied to an end of the polymer . using this powerful algorithm the _ complete _ parameter space of interactions and </S>",
    "<S> force has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been conjectured that a hierarchy of states appears at low temperature / poor solvent conditions where a polymer exists in a finite number of layers close to a surface . </S>",
    "<S> we find re - entrant behaviour from a stretched phase into these layering phases when an appropriate force is applied to the polymer . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that , contrary to what may be expected , the polymer desorbs from the surface when a sufficiently strong critical force is applied and does _ not _ transcend through either a series of de - layering transitions or monomer - by - monomer transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> new experimental methods in the physics of macromolecules @xcite have been used to study and manipulate single molecules and their interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these methods make a contribution to our understanding of such phenomena as protein folding or dna un - zipping ; one can push or pull a single molecule and watch how it responds . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to apply ( and measure ) forces large enough to induce structural deformation of single molecules . </S>",
    "<S> one can monitor the mechanism of some force - driven phase transition occurring at the level of a single molecule . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical understanding of this behaviour has attracted much attention @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the response of a single polymer to an external force under good solvent conditions was considered some time ago@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the response under poor solvent conditions ( below the @xmath0-point ) , where the self - attraction and an external force compete with each other , was examined later @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another phenomenon commonly studied in polymer physics is the adsorption of a polymer tethered to a `` sticky '' wall . </S>",
    "<S> the response of such a polymer to a force perpendicular to the wall has also recently been considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when both the self - attraction ( ie .  </S>",
    "<S> monomer - monomer attraction that leads to polymer collapse ) and the surface attraction ( ie monomer - wall attraction that leads to adsorption ) compete the response to an external force has not yet been elucidated ( some interesting results can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , the full phase diagram has not been considered . </S>",
    "<S> making such a study now is all the more timely because of the very recent discovery @xcite of a new low temperature phenomenon of layering transitions ( without a force ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is this layering phenomenon that raises the intriguing question about the response a low - temperature polymer may have to an external force . in the layering state a polymer is tightly confined within a fixed number of layers above the wall . </S>",
    "<S> it may be therefore be especially interesting experimentally to examine such a situation .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate for the _ first _ time how the full two - dimensional phase diagram of surface and self - attraction changes as the force is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the desorbed extended regime , which changes its scaling behaviour as soon as the force is made non - zero , simply grows as the force is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the second - order phase transitions of adsorption and collapse become first order . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the phase diagram remains relatively unaffected as long as the force is small . </S>",
    "<S> after the force passes a critical value , which depends on the zero temperature force required to pull a polymer from a wall , a re - entrant behaviour occurs at low temperatures . for different values of the force </S>",
    "<S> , this re - entrant behaviour occurs for both the adsorption and collapse of polymers , including the layering phases mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a full force - temperature diagram for all ratios of surface attraction to self - attraction . </S>",
    "<S> all this is achieved with the use of a recently developed algorithm , flatperm @xcite , that is specifically designed to obtain information about the whole phase diagram in one simulation run : it is effectively a stochastic enumeration algorithm that estimates the complete density of states .    </S>",
    "<S> the model we have considered is a self - avoiding walk on a three - dimensional cubic lattice in a half - space . </S>",
    "<S> the self - avoiding walk is attached at one end to the wall with surface energy per monomer of @xmath1 for _ visits _ to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the self - avoiding walk self - interacts via a nearest - neighbour energy of attraction @xmath2 per monomer - monomer _ contact_. ( note that the attractive energies @xmath2 and @xmath1 are taken to be positive . ) a force @xmath3 is applied in the direction perpendicular to the boundary of the half - space ( wall ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of a configuration @xmath4 of length ( number of monomers ) @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 and depends on the number of non - consecutive nearest - neighbour pairs ( contacts ) along the walk @xmath7 , the number of visits to the planar surface @xmath8 , and the height @xmath9 in the direction perpendicular to the boundary ( wall ) of the half - space . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows a diagram of the two - dimensional analogue .        for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it is this density of states that is estimated directly by the flatperm simulation . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm grows a walk monomer - by - monomer starting on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained data for each value of @xmath5 up to @xmath17 , and all permissible values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .    when @xmath18 the phase diagram of the model contains several phases and transitions between them @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for small @xmath19 and @xmath20 there is a desorbed extended ( de ) phase with the polymer behaving as a free flexible polymer in solution ( ie .  swollen or extended in three dimensions ) . for @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> fixed and small , increasing @xmath20 leads to a second - order phase transition ( adsorption ) to a state in which the polymer is adsorbed onto the wall and behaves in a swollen two - dimensional fashion ( ae ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternately , if @xmath19 is increased at small @xmath20 a second - order collapse transition occurs to a state resembling a dense liquid drop . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is known as desorbed collapsed ( dc ) on the assumption that it has little contact with the wall @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been subsequently argued @xcite that for larger @xmath19 there is also a polymer - surface transition to a surface - attached globule ( sag ) phase , where the polymer behave as a liquid drop partially wetting the wall . </S>",
    "<S> this transition will not be seen directly by studying thermodynamic polymer quantities as it occurs as a singularity in the surface free energy and not the bulk free energy of the polymer . when @xmath20 is large , </S>",
    "<S> so that the polymer is adsorbed onto the wall , increasing @xmath19 will result in a two - dimensional ( second - order ) transition to a adsorbed and collapsed phase ( ac ) . in recent work @xcite this ac phase </S>",
    "<S> was also referred to as the _ </S>",
    "<S> 1-layer _ phase because for very large @xmath19 and @xmath21 there exist meta - stable @xmath22-layer phases where the polymer is two - dimensionally collapsed and more - or - less restricted to @xmath22 layers parallel to the wall ( for small @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a series of first - order transitions between adjacent values of @xmath22 occur as @xmath20 is varied at fixed @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> all these transition lines can be seen in the figure 2 ( a ) which shows a plot of the logarithm of the maximum eigenvalue of the ( @xmath23 ) matrix of second derivatives in the variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath24 for fixed @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the local maxima indicate transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the ac phase is expected to be first order in the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> using the evidence available in the literature @xcite , let us now consider what we can expect when @xmath26 . the first important feature to note is that the isotropic de phase is replaced by an anisotropic phase in which the height of the end point of the polymer scales linearly with @xmath5 ; we denote this phase as the _ stretched _ phase . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the transition from stretched to adsorbed phases becomes first - order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , at least in three dimensions @xcite , the transition from the vertically stretched phase to the collapsed phase also becomes first - order . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the multicritical point ( where for @xmath18 the de , ae and dc phases meet ) is now a triple point : the meeting of three first order lines . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the ae to ac phases should not be effected by the application of a small force as it acts in a direction perpendicular to the driving phenomenon of planar collapse .     to a polymer in </S>",
    "<S> the 2-layer adsorbed collapsed phase._,width=302 ]    finally , it is intriguing to ask what happens to the layering phases observed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can imagine that the force simply extends a vertical ` tail ' from a layered block ( see figure 3 ) and that as the force is increased the monomers are peeled off one at a time with corresponding micro - transitions @xcite for each monomer pulled until a vertical rod is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> instead we see at some point a sharp first order transition between the highly stretched vertical rod and a layered system with short tail .    in figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) we show plots of the logarithm of the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix of second derivatives in the variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath24 at fixed @xmath27 ( as in figure 2(a ) ) but at values of @xmath27 being @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that as @xmath27 is increased the stretched phase that occurs for small @xmath19 and @xmath20 expands while the positions of the other phases and transitions move little . </S>",
    "<S> we immediately note that these plots _ do not _ tell the whole story since physically one is usually interested in fixing the force @xmath3 rather than @xmath27 : fixing @xmath27 implies that the force applied goes to zero at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> it is for this reason that the re - entrant behaviour for absorbing polymers @xcite is not seen directly in these plots . </S>",
    "<S> however , re - entrant behaviour does occur and occurs for _ any _ ratio of surface to bulk energies . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the more traditional force - temperature diagram and return to this point .    in figure 4 a plot of the force @xmath30 needed to pull a polymer from the wall for a ranges of temperatures and a parameter @xmath31 which measures the relative strength of the surface ( wall ) interaction to the self - interaction .     </S>",
    "<S> needed to pull a polymer from the surface against temperature @xmath13 and a parameter @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath31 controls the relative strength of wall attraction and self - attraction with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting cases of surface desorption and of pulling a collapsed polymer are easily visible in the plot for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively._,width=325 ]    we have parameterised the energies of surface and self - attraction as @xmath32 and @xmath36 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> using this parameterisation for @xmath37 gives the whole range of attractive activities : the ratio of surface to bulk activities is given as @xmath38 and so is constant for fixed @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath35 we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 which corresponds to pure self - attraction while the other boundary of the parameter space with @xmath34 gives @xmath41 and @xmath42 which is the pure surface adsorption case . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the diagrams given in @xcite in which only adsorption is considered . if a force smaller than @xmath43 is applied the polymer is in the phase appropriate to the value of @xmath31 : either collapsed or adsorbed or both . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand for forces larger than @xmath43 the polymer is in the ` stretched ' phase . </S>",
    "<S> we immediately note that the reentrant behaviour observed in the adsorption - only case @xcite persists for all @xmath31 . fixing the force to be at a value slightly larger than the zero temperature critical force and then increasing the temperature leads to transitions from the stretched state to a non - stretched phase and back again to the stretched state . </S>",
    "<S> this arises due to the entropy of the zero temperature state ; one can easily extend the arguments in @xcite to demonstrate that re - entrant behaviour can occur even when the zero - temperature configuration of the non - stretched state is a hamiltonian ( fully compact ) walk in a cube rather than a totally adsorbed polymer .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the re - entrant behaviour returning to the ( @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath27)-parametrisation . </S>",
    "<S> for fixed @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 , changing the temperature @xmath13 implies moving on a ray in the ( @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath27)-space . at high temperatures the system is in the stretched phase near the origin . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the state of the system depends on the choice of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 . for very large @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the system remains stretched at all temperatures , whereas for very small @xmath3 and low temperatures , the system is in a layered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the re - entrant behaviour manifests itself in the following way : there is a range of @xmath3 for which the system , when moving along a ray in the ( @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath27)-space ( ie .  for fixed @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 ) , changes from a stretched state near the origin to a layered one at intermediate temperatures and then changes back to a stretched state as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath27 become larger .    </S>",
    "<S> if the critical force is zero then the curve in the @xmath44 plane corresponds to the phase boundary of the de phase with the apex of the curve around @xmath45 being the location of the multicritical point . on the other hand for @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> there is a kink in the function @xmath47 at exactly @xmath48 which is a consequence of the first order point coming from the transition from sag / layer phases from small @xmath31 to the ac phase for larger @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> there is the appearance of a kink joining the multicritical point to the zero temperature transition which is presumably a finite temperature effect of the transition to the ac phase .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have studied how the phase diagram of a self - attracting polymer that is also attracted and tethered to a flat wall changes as a vertical force is applied to the un - tethered end of the polymer . </S>",
    "<S> we have accomplished this using a flat histogram monte carlo simulation that is capable of studying the whole range of microscopic energies , temperature and polymer length up to a maximum of @xmath49 monomers . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that re - entrant behaviour occurs at low temperature and for a range of forces for _ all _ relative strengths of self - attraction and surface attraction . for small forces </S>",
    "<S> we have found that only the transition boundary of the `` stretched '' phase moves with increasing force while the rest of the phase diagram is relatively unchanged . in contradiction to what may be expected we have found that the novel layering meta - phases found for large but finite polymer length are unaffected by small forces . </S>"
