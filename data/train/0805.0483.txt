    "_ ab initio _ calculations are a central element of few - body physics .",
    "the only input in such calculations is a well defined hamiltonian . in nonrelativistic nuclear physics one then solves the schrdinger  or equivalent  equations without introducing any approximation . in order to calculate cross sections for reactions , where final or initial states are scattering states in the continuum ,",
    "one is faced with the problem of an _ ab initio _ calculation of such continuum states .",
    "it is well known that already the calculation of a three - body continuum wave function is quite difficult and that today a complete four - body calculation , with all possible break - up channels open , is out of reach .",
    "however , the problem of a many - body continuum state calculation can be circumvented if one uses the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite .",
    "in fact the lit approach allows the _ ab initio _ calculation of reaction cross sections , where a many - body continuum is involved , without requiring the knowledge of the generally complicated many - body continuum wave function .",
    "the scattering problem is reduced to a calculation of a localized function with an asymptotic boundary condition similar to a bound - state wave function .",
    "such an approach was already proposed by efros in 1985 , but with the stieltjes instead of the lorentz integral transform @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found that the application of the stieltjes transform is problematic since it leads to serious inversion problems @xcite .",
    "the lit method has been applied to various electroweak cross sections in the nuclear mass range from a=3 to a=7 . among the applications",
    "are the first realistic _ ab initio _ calculations of the nuclear three- and four - body total photoabsorption cross sections @xcite , as well as of the inelastic neutral current neutrino scattering off @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "in addition first _ ab initio _ calculations have been performed for the total photoabsorption cross sections of @xmath1he and @xmath2li with semirealistic forces @xcite .",
    "other applications were carried out for the inelastic inclusive electron scattering cross section ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . besides inclusive electroweak reactions also lit calculations of exclusive reactions have been performed , namely for @xmath0he@xmath3he and @xmath0he@xmath4h @xcite , @xmath0he@xmath5h @xcite , and @xmath0he@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "further applications and a detailed description of the lit method are presented in a recent review article @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the general form of inclusive and exclusive cross sections of a particle system induced by an external probe is outlined .",
    "sections iii and iv describe the lit approach for inclusive and exclusive response functions , respectively . in section v various lit applications are discussed .",
    "perturbation - induced reactions can be divided in inclusive and exclusive processes . in the former case the final state of the particle system is not observed . in the latter case",
    "the final state is at least partially observed , like _",
    "e.g. _ in an @xmath7 reaction , where besides the scattered electron also an outgoing proton with energy @xmath8 and scattering angle @xmath9 is detected .",
    "inclusive cross sections of perturbation - induced reactions have the following general form ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and are energy and momentum transfer of the external probe to the particle system , @xmath13 denotes the scattering angle of the external probe , @xmath14 is a constant characteristic for the external probe , and @xmath15 are kinematic functions .",
    "the functions @xmath16 describe the various responses of the particle system to the external probe and thus contain information about the dynamics of the particle system .",
    "they are defined as follows @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ground state energy and wave function of the particle system under consideration , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote final state energy and wave function of the final particle system , and @xmath21 is the operator inducing the response function @xmath16 .    as an example for an exclusive cross section we consider the @xmath7 case , here one has @xmath22 where",
    "the @xmath23 dependence of the cross sections is described by the known functions @xmath24 .",
    "exclusive response functions @xmath25 do not have such a simple form as the inclusive functions @xmath16 .",
    "for their definition we refer to @xcite , here we only mention that transition matrix elements from the ground state @xmath26 to a specific final state @xmath27 , @xmath28 are their essential ingredients , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for additional quantum numbers of initial and final state wave functions .",
    "the following relation between the inclusive @xmath16 of ( [ incl_cross ] ) and the exclusive @xmath25 of ( [ exl_cross ] ) holds : @xmath31 note that the number of exclusive response functions is generally greater than the number of inclusive ones ( @xmath32 ) , since the integration over the azimuthal angle of the outgoing particle can yield zero , _",
    "i.e. _ the integration over @xmath23 in the @xmath7 example above .    with additional polarization degrees of freedom for beam and/or target and/or outgoing particles",
    "many more additional inclusive and exclusive response functions can be defined ( see _ e.g. _ the deuteron case in @xcite ) .",
    "as already mentioned , with the lit method one avoids the explicit calculation of scattering wave functions . instead , for the calculation of @xmath16 of ( [ response ] ) one proceeds in the following way .",
    "one first calculates the ground state wave function @xmath18 of the particle system in question .",
    "then one solves the equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hamiltonian of the particle system and @xmath35 are parameters , whose meaning is explained below .",
    "since the eigenvalues of @xmath34 have to be real the homogeneous version of ( [ liteq ] ) has only the trivial solution @xmath36 and thus ( [ liteq ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "in addition , due to the asymptotically vanishing ground state wave function @xmath18 also the right - hand - side of ( [ liteq ] ) vanishes asymptotically . therefore , and because of the complex energy @xmath37 , @xmath38 has a similar asymptotic boundary condition as a bound state .",
    "it means that @xmath38 is a so - called localized function , _",
    "i.e. _ square - integrable with a norm @xmath39 .",
    "this has very important consequences : even if the aim is a calculation of a reaction cross section in the continuum , one is not confronted with a scattering state problem any more , in fact one needs to apply only bound - state techniques for the solution of ( [ liteq ] ) .",
    "the key point of the lit method consists in the fact that the lorentz integral transform l@xmath40 of the response function @xmath16 , @xmath41 is related to the norm @xmath39 , which can be obtained from the solution of ( [ liteq ] ) .",
    "in fact one has @xmath42 ( @xmath12 dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath38 will be dropped in the following ) . in ( [ deflit ] )",
    "@xmath44 is a lorentzian centered at @xmath45 with a width @xmath46 : @xmath47 now also the meaning of the parameters @xmath35 becomes evident : @xmath48 represents a kind of energy resolution , while with @xmath45 a given energy range can be scanned .    with the above equations the principle idea of the lit method",
    "can be explained : one solves the lit equation ( [ liteq ] ) for many values of @xmath45 and a fixed @xmath48 , calculates l@xmath49const ) , and then one inverts the transform in order to determine @xmath50 .    before coming to the inversion we first want to derive the relation ( [ deflit2 ] ) .",
    "starting from the definition of l@xmath40 in ( [ deflit ] ) one has @xmath51 using ( [ response ] ) and carrying out the integration in @xmath52 one gets @xmath53 then one replaces @xmath54 by the hamilton operator @xmath34 and uses the closure property of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 with @xmath57 one sees that relation ( [ deflit2 ] ) is indeed obtained and that @xmath38 fulfills ( [ liteq ] ) .",
    "the standard lit inversion method consists in the following ansatz for the response function @xmath58 here the argument @xmath11 of @xmath16 is replaced by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the break - up threshold of the reaction into the continuum . in case of lit contributions attributed to bound states due to , _",
    "e.g. _ , elastic transitions , one can easily subtract such contributions in order to obtain an `` inelastic '' lit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath61 are given functions with nonlinear parameters @xmath62 .",
    "normally the following basis set is taken @xmath63 substituting such an expansion into the right hand side of ( [ deflit ] ) one obtains @xmath64 where @xmath65 for given values of @xmath62 and @xmath66 the linear parameters @xmath67 are determined from a best fit of l@xmath68 of ( [ sumphi ] ) to the calculated l@xmath68 of ( [ deflit2 ] ) for a fixed @xmath48 and a number of @xmath45 points much larger than @xmath66 .",
    "in addition one should vary the various nonlinear parameter @xmath62 over a sufficiently large range .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 , however , can in general be determined from the known threshold behavior of the response function .",
    "one has to increase @xmath66 up to the point that a stable inversion result is found for some range of @xmath66 values , which then can be taken as final inversion result .",
    "note , however , that a too large value of @xmath66 might lead to an oscillatory behavior of @xmath16 .",
    "the origin for such an unphysical behavior lies in the precision of the calculated l@xmath40 .",
    "if the precision is further increased , higher and higher @xmath66 values can in principle be used in the inversion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one can repeat the whole procedure with a second @xmath48 value .",
    "of course , the inversion should lead to the same @xmath16 result as with the previous @xmath48 .",
    "the basis set @xmath61 can also be modified in order to take into account narrow structures like resonances ( see section v.a ) .",
    "more information concerning the inversion and alternative inversion methods are found in @xcite .",
    "for the exclusive response function @xmath25 one has to evaluate t - matrix elements of the type given in ( [ t_i ] ) .",
    "one starts the lit calculation using the general form of the final state wave function for the considered break - up channel @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a so - called channel function ( with proper antisymmetrization ) given in general by the fragment bound states times their relative free motion and @xmath72 is the sum of potentials acting between particles belonging to different fragments .",
    "thus the transition matrix element @xmath73 ( additional quantum numbers are dropped ) takes the following form @xmath74 the first term of the right - hand - side is the so - called born term ( @xmath75 ) , which can be evaluated without greater problems .",
    "the second term ( @xmath76 ) depends on the final state interaction and its evaluation is much more difficult .",
    "however , using the lit approach , one can proceed as follows .",
    "one rewrites @xmath76 in a spectral representation , @xmath77 with @xmath78 the function @xmath79 has a similar form as an inclusive response function @xmath16 , therefore one can apply an analogous lit method as in the inclusive case , however left- and right - hand sides are not identical , hence two lit equations are obtained : @xmath80 the first one is essentially the same as ( [ liteq ] ) .",
    "the second equation has a different right - hand side , but with the important feature to vanish asymptotically for a nuclear potential @xmath72 .",
    "therefore the equation can again be solved with a bound - state technique . in case of an additional coulomb interaction , one may use coulomb wave functions instead of the free motion @xmath81 if only two of the fragments carry charge .",
    "having calculated @xmath38 and @xmath82 one evaluates the overlap @xmath83 , which is identical to the lit of the function @xmath79 , and hence @xmath79 is obtained by the inversion of the lit . the fsi part of the t - matrix element is then given by @xmath84 and the sum of @xmath76 and the simpler born term @xmath75 leads to the total result for the transition matrix element .",
    "as shown in @xcite the lit formalism for exclusive reactions can be reformulated such that only a solution for @xmath38 is requested , while @xmath82 is not needed .",
    "both possibilities have been used in @xcite , where the @xmath85 reaction has been calculated as a test case for the exclusive lit formalism .",
    "as we have shown in the previous sections the main point of the lit approach consists in the fact that a scattering state problem is reduced to a bound - state - like problem .",
    "in other words the calculation of continuum wave functions is not required , instead one has to solve equations which can be solved with bound - state techniques .",
    "for a@xmath862 the calculation of continuum wave functions is difficult or today even impossible , thus , with the lit method , one can extend the range of calculations to considerably larger a. in fact one may conclude the following : if one is able to carry out a bound - state calculation for a given particle system then the lit approach opens up the possibility to perform calculations for continuum reactions with this particle system . in principle one",
    "is not restricted to use a specific bound - state technique , but in most lit calculations an expansion of ground state @xmath18 and lit function @xmath87 in hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) is employed .",
    "information concerning such expansions is given in @xcite , here we only want to mention that the realistic lit applications for a=3 have been performed with the chh technique @xcite , whereas the realistic ( semirealistic ) applications for a=4 ( a@xmath864 ) have been carried out with the eihh approach @xcite .",
    "for the solution of the lit equation ( [ liteq ] ) the lanczos method is used in most cases @xcite . in this context",
    "it should be pointed out that the lit method is different from an approach where a so - called lanczos response @xmath88 is introduced , which is essentially a lit with small @xmath48 , which , however , is directly interpreted  without any inversion  as a response function ( for more details see @xcite ) .      in order to illustrate how the method works",
    "we first apply the lit approach to a very simple physical problem , namely to the total deuteron photoabsorption cross section in unretarded dipole approximation . in this case",
    "the cross section is given by @xmath89 where @xmath29 is the fine structure constant , @xmath11 is the energy of the photon absorbed by the deuteron , and @xmath90 denotes the response function defined as @xmath91    here @xmath92 and @xmath18 are the deuteron bound state energy and wave function , while @xmath93 and @xmath20 denote relative kinetic energy and wave function of the outgoing @xmath94 pair for a given two - nucleon hamiltonian @xmath34 : @xmath95 the transition operator @xmath96 is defined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the third components of position and isospin coordinates of the i - th nucleon .",
    "the lit of @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 correspond to different partial waves of the final state , namely @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "first we consider deuteron photodisintegration with a realistic nn interaction . in the already mentioned review article of the lit method @xcite",
    ", such a case has been investigated using the av14 nn potential @xcite .",
    "the l@xmath106 result is shown in fig .  1 , while the corresponding inversion results are illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "for the inversion one observes a nice stability range of the results for all the shown @xmath66 values in the whole considered energy range , except for the peak region , where the inversion becomes stable only for higher @xmath66 .",
    "one notes that the @xmath66 values 25 and 26 lead essentially to identical results .    in fig .",
    "3 the final inversion result ( @xmath66=25 ) is compared with the corresponding cross section of a conventional calculation with explicit @xmath94 continuum wave functions @xcite .",
    "one finds an excellent agreement between the two calculations showing that one can reach high - precision results with the lit method .",
    "further lit calculations for the deuteron total photoabsorption cross sections have already been discussed in @xcite . for the aim of the present discussion , _",
    "i.e. _ the way of working of the lit method , @xcite is particularly interesting .",
    "it is a case study for a fictitious @xmath94 system with a low - lying and narrow resonance in the @xmath104 nucleon - nucleon partial wave ( obtained by an additional attractive term , for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the results of a conventional calculation with the fictitious @xmath94 system for the @xmath104 phase shifts and the `` deuteron photoabsorption cross section '' to the @xmath104 final state are shown in figs .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath104 phase shifts exhibit two resonances , at @xmath107 mev and at about @xmath108 mev .",
    "the low - energy resonance leads to the dominant structure of the photoabsorption cross section , a pronounced peak at a photon energy of 2.65 mev with a width @xmath109 of 270 kev , while the second resonance only shows up as a rather tiny peak , which is more than four orders of magnitude smaller than the first peak .    for the lit calculation of the photoabsorption cross section of the fictitious @xmath94 system the inversion basis set @xmath61 ( [ bsetn ] )",
    "is modified to account for the resonant structure , to this end the functions @xmath61 are relabeled : @xmath110 .",
    "in addition a new @xmath111 is defined , @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are additional nonlinear parameters .",
    "the reason for such a lit case study with a resonance lies in the results of a previous lit calculation for the ( e , e ) longitudinal and transverse form factors of @xmath0he @xcite , where a resonance in the coulomb monopole transition was obtained , but its width could not be determined . in the case",
    "study it is shown that for a proper resolution of a resonant structure it is very important to take into account the lit function @xmath116 up to rather large distances @xcite . this has been checked ( i ) by solving ( [ liteq ] ) imposing at a two - nucleon distance @xmath117 an asymptotic boundary condition which leads to a strong fall - off of @xmath118 and ( ii ) by calculating the norm @xmath119 only in the range from @xmath120 to @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "6 we show the results for such a calculation choosing @xmath121 mev .",
    "one notes that for a rather precise result , with errors below about 1% , one has to take @xmath122 fm .",
    "a further increase of @xmath123 to 50 fm leads to a reduction of the relative error by about a factor ten . in fig .",
    "7 the inversions results with @xmath124 and 50 fm are depicted in comparison to the result of the direct calculation .",
    "one observes that for both @xmath123 values the resonance cross section is described with high accuracy .",
    "differences between the two cases become evident in the region of the second maximum and at higher energy . in fact with @xmath124 fm one finds only a reasonably good description , while a considerable improvement is obtained with @xmath125 fm .    as next point",
    "we consider the reduction of @xmath48 from 1 mev to 0.5 mev . as shown in fig .",
    "8 one finds an enhancement of the relative error of @xmath126 by at least a factor of five in comparison to the corresponding @xmath123 values of fig .",
    "6 . the enhancement is easily understood by investigating the asymptotic solution of ( [ liteq ] ) ; in the here considered deuteron case it is described by the exponential fall - off @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the nucleon mass .",
    "it is evident that a smaller @xmath48 leads to a longer range lit function @xmath116 . as discussed in @xcite , for @xmath129 mev",
    "even @xmath130300 fm is not completely sufficient , since only the resonance itself is resolved , but not the cross section at higher energies .    the discussion above seems to infer that it is better to choose a rather large value for @xmath48 . on the other hand",
    "it should also be clear that the width of the resonance @xmath109 and the value of @xmath48 are correlated .",
    "if @xmath48 is too large the resonance can not be resolved . in the case",
    "study it has been found that @xmath131 mev , about seven times larger than the width @xmath109 , is still sufficient for a resolution of the resonance . however , in a general case the resonance width is not known beforehand and the question arises what should be the proper value for @xmath48 in such a case . as pointed out in @xcite one has to proceed as follows .",
    "one performs a lit calculation with a given @xmath48 and compares the result to a lit with a @xmath132-peak in the response function or cross section . for example , in the here discussed deuteron case one sets @xmath133 the resulting @xmath132-lit is then given by the lorentzian function @xmath134 where @xmath135 is chosen such that the peak heights of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are equal .    in order to obtain a reliable inversion the actual lit @xmath137 should have a larger width than the @xmath132-lit @xmath136 . if , on the contrary , they lead to essentially identical results , one has to reduce @xmath48 up to the point that the actual lit is sufficiently different from the corresponding @xmath132-lit . in fig .",
    "9 we show such results for the deuteron case study . for @xmath48=5 and 10 mev",
    "there are practically no differences between lit and @xmath132-lit , while for @xmath138 mev differences become visible . as a matter of fact",
    "@xmath48=2 mev is sufficient for a reliable inversion and thus one may conclude that in a general case one has to use a @xmath48 such that differences between lit and @xmath132-lit have at least the same size as in the @xmath48=2 mev case of fig .",
    "9 .    in fig .",
    "10 we show the final inversion results from @xcite with @xmath13980 fm .",
    "one sees that the e1 resonance is precisely described with the lit method for @xmath140 and 2 mev , while the peak is somewhat underestimated with @xmath141 mev . in the resonance region , with the two lower @xmath48 values ,",
    "essentially the same results are obtained as for the cases of fig .  7 with @xmath48=1 mev and @xmath13930 and 50 fm . from the comparison one further notes that the case @xmath48=2 mev and @xmath142 fm leads to even more precise results in the second resonance region , and beyond , than shown in fig .  7 for @xmath13950 fm .",
    "now we turn to realistic applications of the lit method and consider first the @xmath0he total photoabsorption cross section .",
    "in fact this is one of the very first lit applications @xcite , however , initially only performed with semirealistic nn forces . in @xcite",
    "it has been found that the calculated cross section shows a considerably more pronounced giant dipole resonance than the most recent experimental data of that time .",
    "such a difference between experiment and an _ ab initio _ calculation has led to a renewed experimental interest in the @xmath0he photoabsorption cross section .",
    "in fact in the meantime three additional experiments have been carried out @xcite . finally , in @xcite the first calculation with realistic nn and 3n forces has also been published . in fig .",
    "11 we show the theoretical results of @xcite together with the experimental data .",
    "one notes that the 3n force leads to a considerable reduction of the peak cross section .",
    "one further sees that there is a very good agreement between theory and the data of @xcite and also quite a good agreement with the data of @xcite , while the cross section of @xcite shows a completely different behavior .",
    "also shown in the figure are data from experiments performed about 20 years ago .",
    "it should be mentioned that today two other lit calculations for the @xmath0he total photoabsorption cross section are available @xcite , where different realistic nuclear forces have been used . essentially , they confirm the results of @xcite .    in fig .",
    "12 lit results for the @xmath144li and @xmath144he total photoabsorption cross sections calculated with semirealistic nn forces are shown @xcite . for @xmath144li one",
    "finds a single and rather broad cross section peak . on the contrary for @xmath144he",
    "a very interesting cross section with a double peak becomes apparent in the calculation .",
    "this microscopic result can be interpreted as follows . in a cluster picture , with an @xmath29 core and a di - neutron ,",
    "the low - energy peak is due to the relative motion of di - neutron and @xmath29 core .",
    "the second peak , however , can not be obtained in a cluster model , but is explained by the classical e1 giant resonance picture with a collective response of all nucleons ( relative motion of protons and neutrons ) . for @xmath144li , in a cluster model described by an @xmath29 core plus a deuteron ,",
    "a similar low - energy peak is missing , because the deuteron knock - out corresponds to an isoscalar transition , which can not be induced by the isovector dipole operator ( [ operator ] ) . on the other hand",
    "a transition to the antibound @xmath145 plus @xmath29 core is possible .",
    "the nucleus @xmath144li exhibits a considerably larger width of the giant dipole peak than @xmath144he .",
    "in fact in the former a break - up into two three - body nuclei is possible ( @xmath146h@xmath147he ) , while a similar break - up of @xmath144he is not induced by the dipole operator , since the @xmath146h@xmath147h pair has no dipole moment .",
    "the experimental @xmath144he and @xmath144li photoabsorption cross sections are not yet well settled ( see @xcite ) and therefore not shown here .    in fig .",
    "13 we depict the lit calculation for the @xmath148li total photoabsorption cross section @xcite , in comparison to experimental data @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the experimental cross section has not been determined by summing up the various channel cross sections , but in a single experiment by the `` diminution of photon flux '' method .",
    "like @xmath144li also @xmath148li has a giant dipole resonance peak with a rather large width .",
    "the comparison of experimental and theoretical results shows quite a good agreement , though only a semirealistic nn force has been used in the lit calculation .",
    "of course , it would be very interesting to have even more precise data and also a calculation with realistic nuclear forces .",
    "now we turn to the inclusive electron scattering response functions . for @xmath146h and @xmath146he",
    "lit calculations for the longitudinal response function @xmath149 have been carried out with realistic nuclear forces for momentum transfers below @xcite , and above @xmath12=500 mev / c @xcite .",
    "relativistic corrections for the transition operator @xmath150 have been taken into account and the frame dependence of the essentially nonrelativistic calculation has been studied . in fig .",
    "14 @xmath151 is shown for various lower @xmath12 values @xcite .",
    "one notes that the 3n force reduces the quasielastic peak height somewhat .",
    "the 3n force effect , however , does not lead to a consistent picture in comparison with experiment .",
    "in fact one finds an improvement for @xmath146he and a deterioration for @xmath146h .",
    "in @xcite it has been found that relativistic effects due to the kinetic energy can be largely reduced if @xmath151 is first calculated in a specific reference frame , where the target nucleus moves with a@xmath152 , and then transformed to the lab system .",
    "different from a direct calculation in the lab system , one finds a correct result for the experimentally established quasielastic peak position @xcite , as shown in fig .  15 . at @xmath12=500 and 600 mev / c also for the peak height a good agreement with experimental data",
    "is obtained , whereas the theoretical @xmath151 overestimates the experimental one at @xmath12=700 mev / c ( at even higher @xmath12 experimental data are not available ) . as fig .",
    "15 shows also the choice of the nucleon form factor fit has a non - negligible impact on the result , but can not explain the discrepancy with the data at @xmath153 mev / c .",
    "recently we also calculated the transverse response function @xmath154 with realistic nuclear forces ( @xmath155 mev / c ) @xcite . besides the usual one - body operators also @xmath156 and @xmath157 exchange currents ( ec ) , consistent with the nn potential model , were taken into account .",
    "in addition also the effect of the so - called siegert operator has been studied . in fig .",
    "16 the theoretical results are shown together with experimental data . in the quasielastic region",
    "ec lead to some increase of the peak height ( see left panels of fig .",
    "16 ) , but the ec effect is much larger close to threshold ( see right panels of fig .  16 ) and is important for a good agreement of theory and experiment . for @xmath12=500",
    "mev / c one finds different peak positions in theory and experiment , presumably due to the fact that @xmath158 is calculated directly in the lab frame ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the frame dependence of @xmath158 is presently under investigation .",
