    "the hadronic observables , such as single- or multi - particle hadron spectra , play an important role in the studies of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , these observables contain rather indirect information on the initial stage of the collision process since the particle interactions result in substantial stochastization and thermalization of a system during its evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the final hadronic state can carry some residual signals of the earlier stages of the particle production process . a partial coherence of the produced pions is supposed to be one of the important examples .",
    "the first systematic study of coherent processes in high energy hadron - nucleus ( @xmath2 ) collisions was based on glauber theory @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the @xmath2 collision is considered as a process of subsequent scatterings of the projectile on separate nucleons of the nucleus ; the projectile energies are supposed much higher than the inverse nucleus radius ( @xmath3 ) , thus allowing to consider a linear projectile trajectory inside the nucleus ( eikonal approximation ) .",
    "if the scattering process occurred with almost no recoil of the nucleus nucleons , i.e. with no _ witnesses _ of the individual scatterings , then the @xmath2 collision should be described by a coherent superposition of the elementary hadron - nucleon scattering amplitudes .",
    "such a type of the collision is called coherent scattering .",
    "since the nucleus in coherent scattering does not change its state , it manifests itself just as a particle with some form - factor . in the oscillator approximation",
    ", the nucleus form - factor can be represented by a gaussian : @xmath4 .",
    "the coherent processes are essential only for small momenta transferred from the projectile hadron to the nucleus : @xmath5 then , one can neglect the recoil energy and consider the nucleus as a whole during the scattering process .",
    "there is a kinematic limitation of the minimal longitudinal momentum transfer , @xmath6 , required to produce a particle or a group of particles of the invariant mass @xmath7 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath8 with the increasing energy explains why the coherent processes can take place only at high enough energies .",
    "it is worth noting that the total coherent cross - section does not die out with the increasing energy ( see .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "typically , however , the transferred momenta are sufficient for substantial _ recoil _ effects and the excitation of the nucleus or its breakup .",
    "then , due to a small _ coherence length _ @xmath9 , the nucleus does not participate in the collision as a whole and one can consider the @xmath2 collision as an incoherent superposition of elementary hadron - nucleon scatterings corresponding to random phases of the amplitudes of the latter .",
    "the resulting cross - section is then given by the sum of the moduli squared of the amplitudes ( probabilities ) at each of the possible scattering points ( unlike to coherent scattering , when the individual amplitudes are summed up first ) .",
    "as a result , the particles are produced in chaotic ( incoherent ) states .",
    "let us come back to the production of particles ( e.g. , pions ) in the processes of non - elastic coherent scattering at small transferred momenta . since the nucleus is not excited in these processes and manifests itself as a quasi - classical object , one can describe particle production using the quantum field model of interaction with a classical source @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the interaction with a classical source results in the production of bosons in coherent states @xcite .",
    "these states minimize the uncertainty relation and , so , are the closest to classical ones .",
    "this is the main physical link between the processes of coherent scattering and particle production in coherent states .    in heavy ion collisions at high energies ,",
    "the average multiplicities are quite high , e.g. , several thousands of pions can be produced at maximal rhic energies .",
    "the inclusive particle spectra thus represent natural characteristics of these processes . a convenient way to account for the coherent properties of these processes consists in a model description of particle emission , rather than in detailed evaluation of the contributing amplitudes .",
    "the gyulassy - kauffmann - wilson ( gkw ) model @xcite is an example of such an approach .",
    "the model assumes that all pions are radiated by classical currents ( sources ) which are produced in some space  time region during the collision process .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is constructed by averaging over the unobservable positions of the centers of individual sources .",
    "the pion spectra then effectively contain both chaotic and coherent components .",
    "in fact , the chaotic component dominates in case of a large emission region , while , in the opposite limit of very small space  time extent of this region , almost all pions are produced in the coherent state .",
    "this seems to be rather general result : if the distances between the centers of pion sources are smaller than the typical wave length of the quanta ( the source size ) , the substantial overlap of the wave packets leads to the strong correlations ( indistinguishability ) between the phases in pion wave functions and , thus , to the coherence@xcite .",
    "recently , the coherence of multipion radiation in high energy heavy ion collisions was studied within gkw model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the model , due to the longitudinal lorentz contraction of the colliding nuclei ,",
    "almost all pions produced with small transverse momenta @xmath10 in central nucleus - nucleus collisions are emitted coherently , and their momentum spectra are determined by the system s space  time extent .",
    "clearly , the coherence of pions can be destroyed by pion rescatterings .",
    "nevertheless , the duration of hadron formation may happen to be long enough to allow a considerable part of the coherent pions escape from the interaction zone without rescatterings @xcite .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , one can expect a strong suppression of the gkw mechanism of coherent pion production if quark - gluon plasma were created : the hadronization then occurs in a thermal quark - gluon system and hadrons are produced in the chaotic state only .",
    "note that clear signals of the thermalization and collective flows , observed at cern sps and rhic energies ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , point to strong rescattering effects and may reflect also the importance of the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .    the new physical phenomena , expected in rhic and lhc experiments with heavy ions ,",
    "are associated with the creation of quasi - macroscopic , very dense and hot systems . in such systems , the deconfinement phase transition and the restoration of the chiral symmetry are likely to happen , possibly leading to creation of the new states of matter : quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) . in the latter case , another possibility for the coherent pion radiation ( above the thermal background ) appears .",
    "if the dcc were created at the chiral phase transition , a quasi  classical pion field @xmath11 forms the ground state of the system .",
    "the subsequent system decay is accompanied by a relaxation of the ground state to normal vacuum .",
    "such a process can be described by the quantum field model of interaction with a classical source ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and results in the coherent pion radiation .",
    "one of the general conditions of the ground state rearrangement and formation of the quasi ",
    "classical field is a large enough system volume @xcite .",
    "therefore , such a field could be generated in heavy ion collisions at sufficiently high energies provided the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking via dcc formation takes place .",
    "the overpopulation of the ( quasi ) pion medium , making it close to the bose - einstein condensation point , can lead to the strengthening of the coherent component conditioned by the ground state ( quasi - particle vacuum ) decay @xcite .",
    "since the dcc appears relatively late ( at the end of the hadronization stage ) , the coherent radiation could partially survive and be observed .",
    "the coherent emission manifests itself in a most direct way in the inclusive correlation function @xmath12 of two identical bosons in the region of very small @xmath13 ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in case of only chaotic contribution ,",
    "the intercept of the quantum statistical ( qs ) bose - einstein part of the correlation function @xmath16 @xcite while , in the presence of the coherent radiation , @xmath17 .",
    "generally , the coherence means strong phase correlations of different radiation components . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple quantum  mechanical model of the phase ",
    "correlated one - particle wave packets with different radiation centers has been considered .",
    "in such a case ( corresponding to indistinguishable correlated emitting centers ) , the emission amplitude @xmath18 averaged over the event ensemble is not equal to zero , @xmath19 , and the qs correlation function intercept @xmath20 in the second quantization representation ( more adequate for processes of multi  boson production ) , the analogous results take place for inclusive averages of the quantum field operators : @xmath21 , @xmath17 , provided the radiation has a non - zero _ coherent state _ component .",
    "the latter represents a superposition of the states of all possible boson numbers at fixed phase relations .    in practice ,",
    "most of the correlation measurements is done with _ charged _ particles .",
    "however , charged bosons can not form the usual coherent state since it obviously violates the super - selection rule . to overcome this difficulty , the generalized concept of charge - constrained coherent states",
    "should be used @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the correlations of charged bosons are usually described with the help of ordinary ( not charge - constrained ) coherent states @xcite ( see , however , refs .",
    "our treatment of two - pion correlations takes into account the restrictions imposed by the super - selection rule and is based on the density matrix formalism .",
    "the density matrix approach gives the possibility to describe , in a natural way , the chaotic radiation ( the initial state then corresponding to a local - equilibrium statistical operator of quasi  particle excitations ) and coherent emission ( arising due to the interaction with a classical source ) .",
    "this approach can easily incorporate also the squeeze - state component of pion radiation @xcite , appearing due to the modification of the energy spectrum of quasi - pions as compared with that of free pions @xcite .",
    "the density matrix formalism is also simply related with the wigner function description of the multiparticle phase - space and its evolution governed by the relativistic transport equation @xcite , representing very useful tools with a clear classical limit .",
    "recent development of the classical current approach to multiparticle production @xcite has made it closer to the density matrix formalism ; particularly , the clasical current in momentum space has been shown mathematically identical with the coherent - state representation of the density matrix , the latter called ",
    "@xmath22  or glauber - sudarshan representation @xcite , see also @xcite .    in our approach ,",
    "the super - selection rule requires an averaging , in the density matrix , over all orientations of the quasi - classical pion source in the isospin space . as a consequence ,",
    "the averaged pion field vanishes : @xmath23 whereas , for identical pions , the intercept @xmath24 is still less than 2 .",
    "the correlations of non - identical pions also appear to be sensitive to the presence of the quasi  classical source .",
    "this sensitivity arises due to properties of the generalized coherent states satisfying , after the averaging over all orientations of the quasi - classical source in isospin space , the super - selection rule for charged particles . due to isospin symmetry of the strong - interaction hamiltonian",
    ", there are unique relations for the intercepts @xmath25 of the pure qs correlation functions of two pions in various charge states @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the coherence suppression of @xmath27 determines the coherence enhancement of @xmath28 .",
    "the coherence phenomena can be , however , masked by a number of effects suppressing the measured correlation functions .",
    "the most important among them are the decays of long - lived particles and resonances ( e.g. , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , the single- and two  track resolution and particle contamination . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the method to discriminate between the effects of coherent radiation and decays of long - lived resonances has been proposed .",
    "the method assumes the simultaneous analysis of two- and three  particle correlation functions of identical pions .",
    "the practical utilization of the method is however difficult due to a low statistics of near  threshold three - pion combinations and the problem of the three  particle coulomb interaction ; also , one has to account for the super ",
    "selection rule .",
    "therefore , in the present work we will restrict ourselves to the consideration of two - particle correlation functions .",
    "in addition to qs , the correlations of particles with small relative velocities are also influenced by their final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "the effect of the latter on two  particle correlations is well understood and introduces no principle problems .",
    "it is important that the correlations in different two  pion systems are influenced by the qs , fsi and coherence effects in a different way .",
    "this offers a possibility to discriminate different effects suppressing the measured correlation functions and so to extract the coherent contribution using correlation functions of like and unlike pions measured at small relative momenta .    in the paper",
    "we study the influence of the coherent pion radiation on the behavior of pion inclusive spectra and two  pion correlation functions and , based on it , develop the methods for the extraction of the coherent component above the chaotic background . despite we associate the coherent radiation with the formation of the dcc ( as the most probable mechanism of the coherence in ultra ",
    "relativistic a+a collisions ) , our results are rather general . actually , they are based on the general properties of the coherent pion radiation : the quasi - classical nature of the coherent pion source and the constrains imposed by the charge super  selection rule .    in sec .",

    "iv , we discuss how to extract the coherent component of particle radiation from the two  pion correlation functions , particularly , in the case of large expanding systems produced in ultra - relativistic a+a collisions .",
    "a short summary and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "it is well known that the description of the inclusive pion spectra and two - pion correlations is based on a computation of the following averages @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the normalized invariant production amplitude .",
    "the summation is done over all quantum numbers @xmath36 of other produced particles , including integration over their momenta ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators of asymptotically free pions @xmath39 ; the bracket @xmath40 formally corresponds to the averaging over some density matrix @xmath41 a special attention requires the production of particles with near - by velocities which can be strongly influenced particle interaction in the final state . in this section ,",
    "we concentrate mainly on quantum statistical correlations ignoring , for a while , the effects of resonance decays and fsi .",
    "let us suppose that the density matrix @xmath42 is a statistical operator describing the thermal hadronic system in a pre - decaying state on a hyper - surface of the thermal freeze - out @xmath43 .",
    "after the thermal freeze - out the system is out of local thermal equilibrium but still can be in a pre - decaying ( interacting ) state . in fact , the complete decay ( neglecting the long - time scale forces ) happens at some finite _ asymptotic _ times @xmath44 .",
    "then the formal solution of the heisenberg equation for the pionic annihilation ( creation ) operators at this post thermal freeze - out stage has the form ( an example is @xmath45 in the bjorken hydrodynamic model with the proper expansion time @xmath46 ) , the use of the covariant tomonaga ",
    "schwinger formalism gives the same result with the substitution @xmath47 .",

    "the value @xmath49 depends on the actual form of the source term in the heisenberg equation .",
    "the decay of the system at this stage , @xmath50 , can be accompanied by the coherent pion radiation due to the modification of hadron properties in hot and dense hadronic environment or - due to some peculiarities of the phase transition from qgp to hadron gas , e.g. , the formation of dcc . in both cases ,",
    "almost non  interacting quasiparticle excitations could be formed above a rearranged ground state (  condensate  ) .    in the systems containing the dcc ,",
    "the appearance of the quasi - classical pion field @xmath51 ( corresponding to the density of virtual pionic excitations of the quasi - pionic vacuum ) at the thermal stage is usually described in the mean field approximation as @xmath52 where the field @xmath53 corresponds to the quasi - pion quantum excitations above the temporary vacuum background @xmath54 ( the order parameter ) . assuming the isotopic symmetry of the lagrangian like in the sigma model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we have @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is randomly oriented unit vector , @xmath57 , in the three - dimensional isospin space .",

    "when the decay of such a thermal system happens , the quasi - pion masses approach the usual free particle values and the condensate ( the temporary _ disoriented _ vacuum ) tends to relax back to the normal vacuum by emitting physical pions in coherent states - the vacuum for quasi - particles becomes a coherent state for free particles .",

    "using the density matrix formalism , satisfying the requirements of the isospin symmetry and the super - selection rule for generalized coherent states , and accounting for the final state interaction in the two  body approximation , we have developed methods allowing one to study the coherent component of pion radiation which , in heavy ion collisions , is likely conditioned by formation of a quasi - classical pion source .",
    "these methods are based on a nontrivial modification of the effects of quantum statistics and final state interaction on two  pion correlation functions ( including those of non - identical pions ) in the presence of a coherent pion radiation generated by the decay of the quasipionic ground state (  condensate  ) .",
    "it has been shown that the combined analysis of the correlation functions of like and unlike pions gives the possibility to discriminate between the suppression of the like  pion correlation functions conditioned by the coherent pion component and that due to the decays of long  lived sources .    the methods allowing to extract the coherent pion component from @xmath294 and @xmath1 correlation functions and single ",

    "pion spectra , give us the possibility to determine the spectrum of the coherent pion radiation above the thermal background and , therefore , to estimate the quasipionic condensate at the pre - decaying stage of the matter evolution and discriminate between possible mechanisms of coherent production in ultra  relativistic a+a collisions .",
