    "black holes ( @xmath0 ) and neutron stars ( @xmath1 ) are certainly two major potential sources of gravitational waves ( @xmath2 ) . unlike @xmath0 ,",
    "whose gravitational waveforms are specified essentially by their masses and angular momenta , the characteristics of the gravitational emission from @xmath1 depend on the properties of the nuclear matter .",
    "when nuclear matter is compressed to a sufficiently high density , it turns into uniform three - flavor ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) strange quark matter ( sqm ) , since it is expected that sqm may be more stable than nuclear matter .",
    "the deconfined quark matter appears when the density is so high that the nucleons are `` touching '' each other . at this point ,",
    "when the number density of nucleons @xmath6 , the quarks lose their correlation with individual nucleons and appear in a deconfined phase . since the density required for this to happen is not much higher than nuclear matter density ( @xmath7 ) , the dense cores of neutron stars are the most likely places where the phase transition to quark matter may occur astrophysically . it should be noted that strange quarks ( in a confined phase ) could already exist in neutron stars with a hyperon core@xcite .    in principle , the existence of a thin crust of normal matter is possible at the surface of a strange star . on the other hand , if sqm is metastable at zero pressure , so that it is relatively more stable than nuclear matter only because of the high pressure in the cores of neutron stars , then the final products of the phase transition would be hybrid stars , which consist of quark matter cores surrounded by normal matter outer parts .",
    "the above arguments were made in @xcite and those authors used polytropic equation of state to describe the complex nuclear matter structure .",
    "we proceed similar calculations with a realistic equation of state based on a field theoretical model .",
    "we also make use of a spherical lagrangian hydrodynamical code instead of the eulerian model used in @xcite .",
    "the spherical lagrangian hydrodynamic code divides the star into several concentric shells .",
    "this number of shells is the optimal combination for the variable time step and the number of shells that gives the shortest processing time .",
    "our results show that 1600 shells are enough to model satisfactorily all the stars here studied . to verify",
    "if the number of shells is an optimal choice we ran a couple of models with 6400 shells , and we see that the results are the same as for the models with 1600 shells . the shocks that appear are treated with the inclusion of the artificial viscosity of richmeyer and morton @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations that describe the dynamics of neutron stars are :    @xmath8    the mass conservation equation written in spherical coordinates ; where @xmath9 is the density , @xmath10 the radial coordinate and @xmath11 the velocity . in our code the continuity equation is calculated directly from the grid .",
    "the specific volumes of the lagrangian shells give the density of the star .",
    "the equation of motion is given by :    @xmath12    where the velocity is @xmath13 ; the pressure of the nuclear matter is given by the model described in the next section .",
    "the gravitational potential is @xmath14 .",
    "the energy equation is written as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the thermal energy per gram .",
    "in our investigation we consider a phenomenological qhd lagrangian density@xcite which contains the fundamental baryon octet , the scalar meson fields @xmath17 and the vector meson fields @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , it contains the lightest charged leptons ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) to allow for charge neutrality , @xmath21 -\\frac{1}{4 } \\phi_{\\mu\\nu}\\phi^{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\phi^2 \\phi_\\mu \\phi^\\mu - \\frac{1}{4}\\omega_{\\mu \\nu}\\omega^{\\mu \\nu } \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\frac{1}{2 } { m_\\omega}^2 \\omega_\\mu \\omega^\\mu             - \\frac{1}{4 }                \\mbox{\\bf$\\varrho$}_{\\mu \\nu } \\cdot                \\mbox{\\bf$\\varrho$}^{\\mu\\nu }            + \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\varrho^2 \\mbox{\\bf$\\varrho$}_\\mu \\cdot                \\mbox{\\bf$\\varrho$}^\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\sigma \\partial^\\mu \\sigma-               { m_\\sigma}^2 \\sigma^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu\\sigma^{\\ast } \\partial^\\mu\\sigma^{\\ast } -m_\\sigma^{\\ast 2 } \\sigma^{\\ast 2 } ) + \\sum_l \\bar\\psi_l \\,[\\,i\\,\\gamma_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu } - m_l \\,]\\ , \\psi_l \\label{hyp10a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameterized coupling constants @xcite of the theory are defined as @xmath22 with @xmath23    for the quark matter the mit lagrangian @xcite was adopted . here",
    "we have assumed that the phase transition is of first order .",
    "this last possibility is not favored energetically when the interface tension between quarks and hadrons is important @xcite .",
    "thus , the physical conditions at deconfinement were estimated from gibbs criteria .",
    "we have obtained some important results which seems to be in complete agreement with those obtained by @xcite . the equation of state is shown in fig.1 for three different parameter @xmath24 which leads to different hadron - quark phase transition pressure and density .",
    "three stages of evolution are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the star radius shrinks and the central density is increasing during the collapse . in fig.3",
    "one can find the density evolution of each shell .",
    "the oscillation of the inner shells is clear in the final stage of evolution as it is the ejection of the external shells .",
    "the fourier transform is shown in fig.4 .",
    "this result shows a peak very close to the one shown by @xcite , at 3.1khz , which shall correspond to the fundamental mode as well as other peaks , corresponding to the first pressure modes .",
    "it is also easy to find that most of the energy is released in the fundamental mode , as always claimed . in fig.5 the radius and density evolution",
    "are plotted against time in this same figure .    finally , after a future detection",
    ", one can try to fit the nuclear matter parameters to obtain the frequency of the detection , remembering that , if the frequency falls on the 3.0 - 3.4khz bandwidth , the brazilian schenberg antenna will be able to identify the direction of the source , as shown in @xcite ."
