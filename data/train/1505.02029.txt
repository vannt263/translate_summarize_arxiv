    "vertex - transitive graphs hold a significant place in mathematics , dating back to the time of first recognition of the platonic solids , and also now in other disciplines where symmetry ( and even other properties such as rigidity ) play an important role , such as fullerene chemistry , and interconnection networks .    a major class of vertex - transitive graphs is formed by cayley graphs , which represent groups in a very natural way .",
    "( for example , the skeleton of the @xmath10 molecule is a cayley graph for the alternating group @xmath11 . )",
    "it is easy to test whether a given vertex - transitive graph is a cayley graph for some group : by a theorem of sabidussi @xcite , this happens if and only if the automorphism group of the graph contains a subgroup that acts regularly on vertices .",
    "vertex - transitive graphs that fail this test are relatively rare , the petersen graph being a famous example .",
    "a recent study of small vertex - transitive graphs of valency 3 in @xcite shows that among @xmath12 such graphs of order up to 1280 , only @xmath13 of them are not cayley graphs .    for almost every cayley graph ,",
    "the automorphism group itself is a vertex - regular subgroup @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "any such graph is called a _ graphical regular representation _ of the group @xmath14 , or briefly , a _ grr . _ in a book devoted to the study of @xmath15-valent graphs that are grrs , coxeter , frucht and powers @xcite classified vertex - transitive @xmath15-valent graphs into four types , according to the action of the automorphism group on the _ arcs _ ( ordered edges ) of the graph .",
    "one class consists of those which are arc - transitive , another of those in which there are two orbits on arcs , and the other two are two classes of grrs .",
    "arc - transitive graphs are also called _ symmetric .",
    "_    symmetric graphs have been studied quite intensively , especially in the @xmath15-valent case , by considering the action of the automorphism group on non - reversing walks of given length @xmath16 , known as _ s - arcs .",
    "_ for example , it was shown by tutte @xcite that every finite symmetric @xmath15-valent graph is @xmath16-arc - regular for some @xmath17 , and hence that order of the stabiliser of a vertex in the automorphism group of every such graph is bounded above by @xmath18 .",
    "tutte s theorem and related work have been used to determine all symmetric @xmath15-valent graphs on up to @xmath19 vertices ; see @xcite .",
    "also tutte s seminal theorem was generalised much later by weiss , who used the classification of doubly - transitive permutation groups to prove that every finite symmetric graph of valency greater than @xmath20 is @xmath16-arc - transitive but not @xmath21-arc - transitive for some @xmath22 , and in particular , that there are no @xmath23-arc - transitive finite graphs ; see @xcite",
    ".    another important class of vertex - transitive graphs was investigated by tutte @xcite and bouwer @xcite , namely the graphs that are vertex- and edge - transitive but not arc - transitive .",
    "these are now called _",
    "half - arc - transitive graphs_. every such graph has even valency , and its automorphism group has two orbits on arcs , with every arc @xmath24 and its reverse @xmath25 lying in different orbits ; see @xcite .",
    "bouwer @xcite constructed a family of examples containing one half - arc - transitive graph of each even valency greater than @xmath20 , and the first and third author of this paper have recently proved that other examples of the type considered by bouwer produce infinitely many of every such valency ; see  @xcite .    according to coxeter , frucht and powers @xcite , the idea of classifying cubic vertex - transitive graphs with respect to the arc - orbits of the automorphism group originated in some work by ronald foster over half a century ago , which was presented to his friends in the form of unpublished notes .",
    "the classification is carried out rigorously in their book @xcite .",
    "and although foster s original idea of ` zero - symmetric ' graphs was later expanded to other valencies under the term grr , the classification by arc - orbits itself was never extended in a systematic way to graphs of other valencies .",
    "this paper provides a remedy for that omission . by introducing the concept of _ arc - type _",
    ", we provide a language that can be used to unify the notions of arc - transitivity and half - arc - transitivity and the above - mentioned classification of symmetric @xmath15-valent graphs , and also to extend this classification to vertex - transitive graphs of higher valency .",
    "we can now define the notion of _ arc - type _ for a vertex - transitive graph .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-valent vertex - transitive graph , with automorphism group @xmath2 .",
    "we first make a critical observation about the pairing of arc - orbits .",
    "the orbit of an arc @xmath24 under the action of @xmath2 can be _ paired _ with the orbit of @xmath2 containing the reverse arc @xmath25 , and if these orbits are the same , then the given orbit is said to be _ self - paired_. this is analogous with the definition of paired sub - orbits for transitive permutation groups . in particular , it applies also to the orbits of the stabiliser @xmath3 in @xmath2 of a vertex @xmath4 on the arcs emanating from @xmath4 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath3 containing the arcs @xmath24 and @xmath26 are paired if the arc @xmath26 lies in the same orbit of @xmath2 as the arc @xmath25 .",
    "we define the arc - type of @xmath0 as the partition @xmath27 of @xmath1 as the sum @xmath28 where @xmath6 are the sizes of the self - paired arc - orbits of @xmath3 on the arcs emanating from @xmath4 , and @xmath7 are the sizes of the non - self - paired arc - orbits , in descending order .    similarly , the _ edge - type _ of @xmath0 is the partition of @xmath1 as the sum of the sizes of the orbits of @xmath3 on edges incident with @xmath4 , and can be found by simply replacing each bracketed term @xmath29 by @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) .",
    "the number of possibilities for the arc - type @xmath27 depends on the valency @xmath1 . for @xmath32",
    "there is just one possibility , namely with @xmath33 , and this occurs for the complete graph @xmath34 .",
    "for @xmath35 , in principle there could be three possibilities , namely @xmath20 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but every 2-valent connected graph is a cycle , and is therefore arc - transitive , with arc - type @xmath20 . in particular , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can not occur as arc - types . for @xmath36 there are four possibilities ( namely @xmath15 , @xmath37 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and they all occur , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises as to what arc - types occur for higher valencies .    in this paper",
    ", we provide some basic theory for arc - types , which helps us to answer that question . in particular , we give for each positive integer @xmath1 the number of different partitions of the above form ( [ arctype ] ) for @xmath1 , by means of a generating function .",
    "this gives a closed form solution for the number of different possibilities in the case of a grr of given valency @xmath1 .",
    "( as a curiosity , we mention there is also a connection with the different root types of polynomials with real coefficients . )",
    "then as our main theorem , we show that with the exception of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , every partition @xmath27 as defined in ( [ arctype ] ) is _ realisable _ , in the sense that there exists at least graph with @xmath27 as its arc - type . to prove this , we consider how to combine ` small ' vertex - transitive graphs into a larger vertex - transitive graph , preserving ( but increasing the number of ) the summands in the arc - type . the key step is to show that the arc - type of a cartesian product of such graphs is just the sum of their arc - types , when the graphs are ` relatively prime ' with respect to the cartesian product .",
    "our proof of the theorem then reduces to finding suitable ` building blocks ' , to use as base cases for the resulting construction .",
    "several interesting families and examples of graphs are found to be helpful . in particular",
    ", we introduce the concept of a special kind of _ thickened cover _ of a graph , obtained by replacing some edges of the given graph by complete bipartite graphs , and other edges by ladder graphs ( with ` parallel ' edges ) . under some special conditions ,",
    "the thickened cover is vertex - transitive , and it is easy to compute its arc - type from the arc - type of the given base graph .    finally , as a corollary of our main theorem , we show that every standard partition of a positive integer @xmath1 is realisable as the _ edge - type _ of a vertex - transitive graph of valency @xmath1 , except for @xmath8 ( when @xmath35 ) .",
    "vertex - transitve graphs are key players in algebraic graph theory , but also ( as intimated earlier ) they have important applications in other branches of mathematics .",
    "in group theory they play a crucial role as cayley graphs . in geometry",
    "they are encountered in convex and abstract polytopes , incidence geometries , and configurations , and in manifold topology they feature in the study of regular and chiral maps and hypermaps , and riemann and klein surfaces with large automorphism groups .",
    "classification of vertex - transitive graphs by their edge- or arc - type gives a new viewpoint , and helps provide a better understanding of their structure .",
    "this approach can also be fruitful in terms of determining all small examples of various kinds of graphs , akin to the census of @xmath15-valent symmetric graphs on up to 10000 vertices @xcite , the census of vertex - transitive graphs up to 31 vertices @xcite , or the census of small @xmath38-valent half - arc - transitive graphs and arc - transitive digraphs of valency @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "for example , the construction used by potonik , spiga and verret to obtain their census of vertex - transitive @xmath15-valent graphs on up to 1280 vertices in @xcite depends on the edge - type , and their census of all connected quartic arc - transitive graphs of order up to @xmath39 ( also in @xcite ) was obtained by associating some of them with vertex - transitive @xmath15-valent graphs of edge - type @xmath37 ( and using cycle decompositions ) ; see also @xcite . in these cases",
    "it was a stratified approach that enabled the limits of the census to be pushed so high , and it is likely that for graphs of higher valency or larger order , this kind of approach will be invaluable .",
    "all the graphs we consider in this paper are finite , simple , undirected and non - trivial ( in the sense of containing at least one edge ) . given a graph @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath40 and @xmath41 the set of vertices and the set of edges of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we denote an edge of @xmath0 with vertices @xmath42 and @xmath4 by @xmath43 , or sometimes more briefly by @xmath44 . for any vertex @xmath4 of @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath45 the set of edges of @xmath0 incident with @xmath4 .    associated with each edge @xmath43 there are two _ ordered edges _ ( also called _ arcs _ ) of @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and we denote by @xmath48 the set of arcs of @xmath0 . also for a vertex @xmath4 of @xmath0",
    ", we define @xmath49 as the set of arcs of @xmath0 that emanate from ( or start at )  @xmath4 .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "note that the action of @xmath50 on the vertex - set @xmath40 also induces an action of @xmath50 on the edge - set @xmath41 and one on the arc - set @xmath48 .",
    "if the action of @xmath50 is transitive on the vertex - set , edge - set , or arc - set , then we say that @xmath0 is _ vertex - transitive _ , _ edge - transitive _ or _ arc - transitive _ , respectively .",
    "an arc - transitive graph is often also called _ symmetric_. the graph @xmath0 is _ half - arc - transitive _ if it is vertex - transitive and edge - transitive , but not arc - transitive . note that the valency of a half - arc - transitive graph is necessarily even ; see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we only consider vertex - transitive graphs .",
    "obviously , vertex - transitive graphs are always regular .",
    "moreover , because a disconnected vertex - transitive graph consists of pairwise isomorphic connected components , we may restrict our attention here to connected graphs .",
    "also we will sometimes use ` vt ' as an abbreviation for vertex - transitive .",
    "next , let @xmath14 be a group , and let @xmath51 be a subset of @xmath14 that is inverse - closed and does not contain the identity element . then the _ cayley graph _ @xmath52 is the graph with vertex - set @xmath14 , and with vertices @xmath42 and @xmath4 being adjacent if and only if @xmath53 ( or equivalently , @xmath54 for some @xmath55 ) . since we require @xmath51 to be inverse - closed , this cayley graph is undirected , and",
    "since @xmath51 does not contain the identity , the graph has no loops .",
    "also @xmath52 is regular , with valency @xmath56 , and is connected if and only if @xmath51 generates @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that @xmath14 acts as a group of automorphisms of @xmath52 by right multiplication , and this action is vertex - transitive , with trivial stabiliser , and so this action of @xmath14 on @xmath52 is sharply - transitive ( or _ regular _ ) .",
    "hence in particular , @xmath52 is vertex - transitive .    indeed the following ( which is attributed to sabidussi @xcite )",
    "shows how to recognise cayley graphs :    [ lemma : sabidussi ] a graph @xmath0 is a cayley graph for the group @xmath14 if and only if @xmath0 is vertex - transitive and @xmath14 acts regularly on @xmath40 .",
    "more generally , a graph @xmath0 is a cayley graph if and only if some subgroup of @xmath50 acts regularly on @xmath40 .",
    "observe that for a fixed @xmath55 , all the edges of form @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 lie in the same edge - orbit ( as each other ) under the automorphism group of @xmath52 , and similarly , that all the arcs of the form @xmath60 lie in the same arc - orbit . if all such arc - orbits are distinct , then @xmath14 is the full automorphism group of @xmath52 , and @xmath52 is called a _ graphical regular representation _ of the group @xmath14 , or briefly a @xmath61 for @xmath14 .",
    "another term for such a graph is _ zero - symmetric_. note that if @xmath0 is a connected zero - symmetric graph ( or grr ) with valency @xmath1 , then @xmath0 has @xmath1 arc - orbits , and all the arcs emanating from a given vertex @xmath4 lie in different arc - orbits .",
    "moreover , if @xmath62 , then the stabiliser @xmath63 of any vertex @xmath4 must fix each neighbour of @xmath4 , and then by connectedness , it follows that @xmath63 is trivial .",
    "thus @xmath14 acts regularly on @xmath40 , and so by lemma [ lemma : sabidussi ] , the graph @xmath0 is a cayley graph for @xmath14 .",
    "next , we describe another group - theoretic construction , for a special class of vertex - transitive graphs .",
    "let @xmath14 be a group , let @xmath64 be a subgroup of @xmath14 , and let @xmath65 be an element of @xmath14 such that @xmath66 .",
    "now define a graph @xmath67 by setting @xmath68 this graph @xmath69 is called a ( _ sabidussi _ ) _ double coset graph_. as with cayley graphs , the given group @xmath14 induces a group of automorphisms of @xmath70 by right multiplication , since @xmath71 whenever @xmath72 .",
    "again this action is vertex - transitive , since @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the stabiliser of the vertex @xmath64 is @xmath74 , which is @xmath64 itself , and this acts transitively on the neighbourhood @xmath75 of @xmath64 , so in fact @xmath76 is arc - transitive .",
    "conversely , every non - trivial arc - transitive graph @xmath0 can be constructed in this way , by taking @xmath62 , and @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , and @xmath65 as any automorphism in @xmath14 that interchanges @xmath4 with one of its neighbours .",
    "finally , we mention a convenient way to describe cubic hamiltonian graphs , that will be useful later .",
    "let @xmath0 be a cubic hamiltonian graph on @xmath79 vertices .",
    "label the vertices of @xmath0 with numbers @xmath80 , such that vertices @xmath81 and @xmath82 are consecutive in a given hamilton cycle for @xmath83 ( treated modulo @xmath79 ) .",
    "each vertex @xmath81 is adjacent to @xmath84 and @xmath82 ( mod @xmath79 ) , and to one other vertex , which has label @xmath85 , say .",
    "now define @xmath86 for @xmath83 .",
    "then the _ lcf - code _ of @xmath0 is given by the sequence @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "clearly the lcf - code defines the graph @xmath0 , since the edges are @xmath88 for all @xmath81 ( mod @xmath79 ) and @xmath89 for all @xmath81 ( mod @xmath79 ) . on the other hand , the lcf is not necessarily unique for @xmath0 ( since it depends on the choice of hamilton cycle ) .",
    "note also that if the code sequence is periodic , then it is sufficient to list a sub - sequence and indicate how many times it repeats , using a superscript .",
    "for example , @xmath90 ^ 4 $ ] is the lcf - code of a 3-dimensional cube .",
    "let @xmath0 be a vertex - transitive graph of valency @xmath1 , and let @xmath91 be the set of orbits of @xmath62 on @xmath41 .",
    "this partition of @xmath41 into orbits also induces a partition of the set @xmath45 of all edges incident with a given vertex @xmath4 , namely into the sets @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "these are simply the restrictions of the edge - orbits @xmath94 to the set @xmath45 .",
    "if we let @xmath95 for each @xmath81 , then we may define the _ edge - type _ of @xmath0 to be the partition of the valency @xmath1 as the sum @xmath96 where we assume that the numbers @xmath97 are in descending order .",
    "note that by vertex - transitivity , the numbers @xmath97 do not depend on the choice of @xmath4 .",
    "( indeed when @xmath0 is finite , counting incident vertex - edge edge pairs @xmath98 with @xmath99 gives @xmath100 and therefore @xmath101 for each @xmath81 . ) hence in particular , the edge - type does not depend on the choice of @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the edge - type of @xmath0 by @xmath102 .",
    "it is not at all obvious as to which partitions can occur as the edge - type of a vertex - transitive graph .",
    "the edge - type of a vertex - transitive cubic graph can be @xmath15 , or @xmath37 , or @xmath103 , while that of a vertex - transitive quartic graph can be @xmath38 , or @xmath104 , or @xmath105 , or @xmath106 , or @xmath107 .",
    "we will see instances of all of these in section [ sec : small_examples ] . then later , in section",
    "[ sec : realise ] , we will show that with the exception of @xmath8 ( for @xmath35 ) , every standard partition of a given positive integer @xmath1 can be realised as an edge - type .    to enumerate the possibilities for a given valency @xmath1",
    ", we may use generating functions for integer partitions .",
    "let @xmath108 denote the number of partitions of @xmath1 with @xmath109 parts , and let @xmath110 denote the number of partitions of an integer @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , @xmath111 .",
    "the generating functions for integer partitions are very well - known , and can be found in @xcite for example .",
    "in fact , the generating function @xmath112 for @xmath108 is given by @xmath113 and then by taking @xmath114 , we get @xmath115 as the generating function for @xmath116 itself .",
    "in this section we refine the notion of edge - type of a vertex - transitive graph @xmath0 , by considering the action of @xmath50 on the arcs of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath117 be an orbit of @xmath50 on @xmath48 , and let @xmath118 be its _ paired _ orbit , in the same way that a permutation group on a set @xmath119 has paired orbitals on the cartesian product @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath121 is also an orbit of @xmath50 on @xmath48 , and that the union @xmath122 consists of all the arcs obtainable from an orbit of @xmath50 on edges of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that @xmath117 is _ self - paired _ if @xmath123 and _ non - self - paired _ if @xmath124 .",
    "we can now write the orbits of @xmath50 on @xmath48 as @xmath125 where @xmath126 are self - paired , while @xmath127 are non - self - paired .",
    "this partition of @xmath48 into these orbits of @xmath128 also induces a partition of the set of arcs emanating from a given vertex . for any vertex @xmath4 of @xmath0 ,",
    "define @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and @xmath131 for @xmath132 . again since @xmath0 is vertex - transitive , these numbers do not depend on the choice of @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , it follows that @xmath133 for @xmath132 .",
    "hence the @xmath134 are the sizes of the self - paired arc - orbits restricted to @xmath135 , while the @xmath136 are the sizes of the non - self - paired arc - orbits restricted to @xmath135 , and thus we obtain @xmath137 just as in ( [ arctype ] ) in the introduction .",
    "this is the _ arc - type _ of @xmath0 , and we denote it by @xmath138 .",
    "we may call the expression on the right - hand - side of the above a _ marked partition _ of the integer @xmath1 . by this , we mean simply a partition in which some pairs of equal - valued summands are placed in parentheses , or bracketed .",
    "note that the parentheses in a marked partition @xmath27 are important , because when @xmath27 represents the arc - type of a vt graph , they indicate that the two numbers summed between the parentheses are the sizes of two paired arc - orbits corresponding to the same edge - orbit .",
    "since the order of the arc - orbits of each of the two kinds ( self - paired and non - self - paired ) can be chosen arbitrarily , we may consider two marked partitions to be equal if they have the same summands , possibly in a different order .",
    "usually we will assume that the summands of each kind ( unbracketed and bracketed ) are in descending order , so that @xmath139 and @xmath140 .    in a sense ,",
    "the three most important classes of vertex - transitive graphs are the arc - transitive , half - arc - transitive and zero - symmetric graphs , and their arc - types are as follows : +    * arc - transitive graphs of valency @xmath1 have arc - type @xmath1 ; + * half - arc - transitive graphs of even valency @xmath1 have arc - type @xmath141 ; + * zero - symmetric graphs have arc - type @xmath142 .",
    "in particular , it follows that there are @xmath143 possibilities for the arc - type of a @xmath1-valent zero - symmetric graph ( or grr ) .    at this point",
    ", we note that the arc - type of a vt graph @xmath0 with automorphism group @xmath14 can be determined by considering solely the action of the vertex - stabiliser @xmath63 on the neighbourhood @xmath144 of an given vertex @xmath4 .",
    "this observation follows from standard theory of transitive permutation groups .",
    "if @xmath117 is an arc - orbit of @xmath14 , then the set @xmath145 is an orbit of @xmath63 on @xmath144 , and conversely , if @xmath146 is an orbit of @xmath63 on @xmath144 , then @xmath147 is a orbit of @xmath14 on @xmath48 .",
    "also the arc - orbit @xmath117 is self - paired if and only if @xmath146 is a self - paired orbit of @xmath63 on @xmath144 , since both mean that the arc @xmath25 lies in the same orbit as @xmath24 , for some @xmath148 .",
    "hence in particular , the summands in the arc - type of @xmath0 are just the sizes of the orbits of @xmath63 on the neighbourhood of a vertex @xmath4 of @xmath0",
    ".    next , by finding the generating function for the set of marked partitions , we can also count the ( maximum ) number of possible arc - types for each valency @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath149 denote the number of marked partitions of @xmath1 with @xmath109 parts , and let @xmath150 denote the number of marked partitions of an integer @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , @xmath151 .",
    "we can obtain the generating function @xmath152 for @xmath149 by adapting the generating function for standard partitions , to take account of the bracketed pairs .",
    "this can be found from @xcite , for example , and is as follows : @xmath153 then by taking @xmath114 , we get @xmath154 as the generating function for @xmath155 itself .    here",
    "we remark that a different combinatorial approach can be taken for the generating function @xmath156 , namely through refining integer partitions by labelling some even parts .",
    "( for example , the partition @xmath157 gives rise to three labelled partitions : @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . )",
    "now let @xmath160 denote the number of labelled partitions of an integer @xmath1 having @xmath109 parts .",
    "then the generating function for @xmath160 is @xmath161 and we find that @xmath162 .",
    "+ also we note that the generating function @xmath156 defines the sequence @xmath163 which is denoted by a002513 in the on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences @xcite .    finally , it should come as no surprise that marked partitions of a positive integer @xmath1 can be used also to count different types of solutions of a real polynomial equation of degree @xmath1 , when attention is paid whether the roots are real and unequal , real and equal ( in various combinations ) or simple or multiple complex conjugate ; see @xcite .",
    "in this section we give examples of vertex - transitive graphs with every possible edge - type and arc - type , for valencies up to 4 , and summarise the information in table [ table : at ] at the end .",
    "note that it is enough to find examples of vt graphs for each arc - type , since the same graphs will give also all the possible edge - types .",
