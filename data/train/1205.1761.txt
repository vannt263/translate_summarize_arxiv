    "recently , the higher order multiplicity moments have gained prominence in high energy physics with a huge hope in pinpointing the qcd critical endpoint ( cep ) @xcite connecting the first order boundary separating the hadronic from the partonic matter at high density with the cross - over boundary at low density @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the hadron resonance gas partition function is an approximation to a non - singular part of the free energy of qcd in the hadronic phase .",
    "there are large theoretical uncertainties of its location and even its existence is not fully confirmed , yet @xcite . the characteristic feature of cep are critical dynamical fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the higher order moments are conjectured to reflect the large fluctuations associating the hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "this was the motivation of a remarkable number of experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "recently , various calculations have shown that the higher order moments of the multiplicity distributions of some conserved quantities , such as net - baryon , net - charge , and net - strangeness , are sensitive to the correlation length @xmath2 @xcite , which in turn is related to the higher order moments , themselves .",
    "in realistic heavy - ion collisions , the correlation length is found to remain finite .",
    "apparently , it should not be an exception that the strongly interacting qcd matter undergoes phase transition(s ) at extreme conditions , as almost all matter types suffer from such a critical change as the extreme conditions change .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations predict that a cross - over takes place between the hadronic phase and the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , when the temperature exceeds critical value of @xmath3mev . as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the different parameters ( for instance , the quark favours and their masses ) and on the lattice configurations , lattice qcd assigns different values to @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath4 depends on the baryon chemical potential @xmath5 . with vanishing @xmath5",
    "the lattice qcd calculations @xcite show that the higher order susceptibilities can be related to the higher order moments of the corresponding multiplicity distributions .",
    "they also show non - monotonic behavior near @xmath4 .",
    "apparently , the qcd phase diagram including cep can be mapped out using this characteristic behaviour . in literature",
    ", one finds that the qcd phase diagram has been determined using various criteria , such as critical energy density @xcite or line of constant physics @xcite .",
    "also the chemical freeze - out curve can be characterized assuming constant physics .",
    "for a recent and extensive review , we refer to @xcite and the references therein .    at large chemical potential @xmath5 , various calculations based on qcd - based models indicate that the transition from the hadronic phase to the qgp phase is of first order .",
    "the endpoint connecting this line with the one of the cross over ( at small @xmath5 ) is likely of second order @xcite .",
    "therefore , the phase transition should be accompanied with large fluctuations in different physical quantities .",
    "experimentally , we study the qcd phase diagram by varying the colliding energy in heavy - ion collisions and determining the critical temperature @xmath4 @xcite . the possibility of finding qcd cep has motivated the rhic beam energy scan program @xcite . by tuning the collision energy from a center - of - mass energy of @xmath6gev down to @xmath7gev , we are able to vary the baryon chemical potential from @xmath8 to @xmath9mev .",
    "nevertheless , there are large theoretical uncertainties of its location and even its existence is not fully confirmed @xcite",
    ". the higher order moments of various physical quantities are conjectured to reflect the non - monotonic behaviour near the qcd cep . in the present work ,",
    "we give a systematic study for the higher order moments of the multiplicity distribution and show their ability to represent the fluctuations along the qcd phase diagram .",
    "many reasons speak for utilizing the physical resonance gas model ( hrg ) in predicting the hadron abundances and their thermodynamics .",
    "the hrg model seems to provide a good description for the thermal evolution of the thermodynamic quantities in the hadronic matter  @xcite and has been successfully utilized to characterize the conditions deriving the chemical freeze - out at finite densities  @xcite . in light of this , hrg can be used in calculating the higher order moments of particle multiplicity using a grand canonical partition function of an ideal gas with all experimentally observed states up to a certain large mass as constituents .",
    "the hrg grand canonical ensemble includes two important features @xcite ; the kinetic energies and the summation over all degrees of freedom and energies of resonances . on other hand",
    ", it is known that the formation of resonances can only be achieved through strong interactions  @xcite ; _ resonances ( fireballs ) are composed of further resonances ( fireballs ) , which in turn consist of resonances ( fireballs ) and so on_. in other words , the contributions of the hadron resonances to the partition function are the same as that of free particles with some effective mass . at temperatures comparable to the resonance half - width , the effective mass approaches the physical one @xcite .",
    "thus , at high temperatures , the strong interactions are conjectured to be taken into consideration through including heavy resonances .",
    "it is found that hadron resonances with masses up to @xmath10gev are representing suitable constituents for the partition function  @xcite .",
    "such a way , the singularity expected at the hagedorn temperature  @xcite can be avoided and the strong interactions are assumed to be considered .",
    "nevertheless , the validity of hrg is limited to temperatures below the critical one , @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the first six non - normalized higher order moments of the particle multiplicity in the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model , which is introduce in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ nonnorltc ] ,",
    "we suggest an answer to the question : what is needed when going from  trivial  lower order to  sophisticated  higher order moments ? based on results , general expressions for arbitrary higher moments are deduced , so that it is possible to conclude that going from lower to higher order moments is achievable through a series of lower order moments and correlation functions .",
    "the thermal evolution of the first four normalized moments and their products ( ratios ) are studied at different chemical potentials @xmath5 in section [ sec : norm ] .",
    "therefore , it is possible to evaluate them at the chemical freeze - out curve , which is characterized by constant @xmath11 at all values of @xmath5 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are entropy density and temperature , respectively .",
    "sections [ sec : chemfo ] and [ sec : cep ] are devoted to introduce novel conditions describing the chemical freeze - out curve and define the location of the qcd critical endpoint .",
    "in a grand canonical ensemble , it is straightforward to derive an expression for the pressure . in section [ nonnorltc ] ,",
    "we give a list of different moments of particle multiplicity .",
    "as we move from lower order to higher order multiplicities , certain distribution functions are being added / subtracted .",
    "these distribution functions represent higher order correlations . in section [ sec :",
    "norm ] , we list out various normalized higher order moments , the normalization being based on the variance @xmath14 .",
    "the products ( ratios ) of normalized moments are elaborated in section [ sec : mult ] .",
    "the hadron resonances treated as a free gas  @xcite are conjectured to add to the thermodynamic pressure in the hadronic phase ( below @xmath4 ) .",
    "this statement is valid for free as well as for strongly interacting resonances .",
    "it has been shown that the thermodynamics of strongly interacting system can also be approximated to an ideal gas composed of hadron resonances with masses @xmath15gev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the confined phase of qcd , the hadronic phase , is modelled as a non - interacting gas of resonances .",
    "the grand canonical partition function reads z(t , , v ) & = & where @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath13 is the temperature .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the sum of the kinetic energies of relativistic fermi and bose particles .",
    "the main motivation of using this hamiltonian is that it contains all relevant degrees of freedom of confined and strongly interacting matter .",
    "it includes implicitly the interactions that result in resonance formation .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this model can submit a quite satisfactory description of particle production in heavy - ion collisions . with the above assumptions",

    "was speculated @xcite .",
    "based on statistical models like hagedorn @xcite and bootstrap @xcite , the thermodynamics of such an ideal pion gas is studied , extensively . after the qcd , the new phase of matter is known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the physical picture was that at @xmath4 the additional degrees of freedom carried by qgp are to be released resulting in an increase in the thermodynamic quantities like energy and pressure densities .",
    "the success of hadron resonance gas model in reproducing lattice qcd results at various quark flavours and masses ( below @xmath4 ) changed this physical picture drastically .",
    "instead of releasing additional degrees of freedom at @xmath22 , the interacting system reduces its effective degrees of freedom at @xmath23 . in other word",

    "the chemical potential assigned to the light quarks is @xmath30 and the one assigned to strange quark reads @xmath31 .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath32 is calculated as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath24 under the assumption that the overall strange quantum number has to remain conserved in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "as given in the introduction , the higher order moments can be studied in different physical quantities .",
    "for example , the higher order moments of charged - particle multiplicity distribution have been predicted four decades ago @xcite .",
    "recently , the higher order moments of various multiplicity distributions have been reported by star measurements @xcite and lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the empirical relevance of the higher order moments to the experimental measurements has been suggested in ref .",
    "accordingly , the measurement of the correlation length seems to be very much crucial . in a future work",
    ", we shall discuss the experimental signatures of the higher order moments .",
    "another ingredient would be the experimental sensitivity for the suggested signatures , which are based on singular behavior of thermodynamic functions .",
    "for the time being , we just want to mention that the experimental measurements apparently take place at the final state of the collision , which would mean that the signals have to survive the extreme conditions in such high energy collisions .",
    "it has been pointed out that the contribution of the critical fluctuations to the higher order moments is proportional to a positive power of @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is conjectured to diverge at qcd cep and such an assumption is valid in the thermodynamic limit .    in the present work ,",
    "we first study the contribution of the hadron resonance mass spectrum in clarifying the interrelations between the various non - normalized and normalized moments .",
    "the motivation of using resonance gas is clear @xcite . as introduced about five decades ago",
