    "the idea of analyzing the differential equations by applying the transformation groups implied a new theory : the symmetry group theory , also called lie group analysis .",
    "this method was originated at the end of nineteenth century from the pioneering work of sophus lie @xcite . since that time",
    ", several books have been dedicated to this concept and its generalizations [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "classification of the group invariant solutions and reduction of the original system can be regarded as significant applications of the lie group method in the theory of differential equations .",
    "the fact that symmetry reductions for many pdes can not be obtained via the classical symmetry method , motivated the creation of several generalizations of the classical lie group method for symmetry reductions . consequently",
    ", several alternative reduction methods have been proposed , going beyond lie s classical procedure and providing further solutions .",
    "partially invariant solutions ( piss ) method is one of these procedures .",
    "this algorithmic method is a powerful tool for the reduction of pdes and is based on classifying the subgroups of the symmetry group .",
    "the notion of piss was first developed by ovsiannikov @xcite and can be considered as the extension of invariant solutions .",
    "the algorithm of constructing piss is similar to that of invariant solutions . indeed , obtaining the invariant solutions by applying the piss method is easier than similarity reduction method whenever we deal with low - dimensional groups .",
    "one significant concept which appears while constructing piss is the defect structure .",
    "this quantity is determined by the dimension of orbits and is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "+ @xmath2 in this paper , the piss method will be applied in order to construct some new classes of four - dimensional einstein walker manifolds . those manifolds which admit null parallel distributions",
    "are called _",
    "walker manifolds_. a walker manifold is called _ einstein walker manifold _ if its ricci tensor is a scaler multiple of the metric at each point .",
    "four - dimensional einstein walker manifolds form the underling structure of many geometric and physical models such as ; hh - space in general relativity , pp - wave model and other areas [ 6 - 12 ] .",
    "the general form of the metric tensor of four - dimensional walker manifolds is expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are smooth functions with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 , where @xmath9 be an open subset of @xmath10 .",
    "we can see that @xmath11 is einstein if and only if the functions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 verify the following system of pdes ( @xcite , page 81 ) . @xmath12 where the index 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 for functions",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the derivatives of these functions with respect to @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the system ( [ a7 ] ) is hard to handle , so we consider a spacial case in this paper ; where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 only depend on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . therefore the following system must be solved .",
    "@xmath17 in system ( [ 2 ] ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are independent and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are dependent variables .",
    "it is worthwhile to say that some other special cases have been considered in many references which yield some results about the structures admitted by these manifolds [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "+ @xmath2 in @xcite , we have comprehensively analyzed the problem of symmetries of the system ( [ 2 ] ) . by applying the basic lie symmetry method ,",
    "we have obtained the classical lie point symmetry operators of the system ( [ 2 ] ) and proved the following result ( refer to @xcite for more details ) :    [ 1.1 ] the lie group of point symmetries of the pde system ( [ 2 ] ) has a seven - dimensional lie subalgebra generated by the following vector fields : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , ... ) .",
    "mainly , we have constructed an optimal system of one - dimensional subalgebras in @xcite which provides the preliminary classification of group invariant solutions for the system ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "also , we have obtained the corresponding invariant solutions of this system via the method of similarity reduction . + it is worth considering that some of the partially invariant solutions are not invariant with respect to the subalgebras of lower dimensions .",
    "they are known as non - reducible piss . by determining non - reducible piss for the system ( [ 2 ] ) , we can obtain some new four - dimensional einstein walker manifolds . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we recall the general procedure of determining piss . in section 3 , we classify the two - dimensional subalgebras of the symmetry lie algebra and construct an optimal system .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the computation of some of the piss associated to the system ( [ 2 ] ) . in section 5 ,",
    "the relation between piss and invariant solutions is investigated and the condition for obtaining the non - reducible piss is stated . meanwhile ,",
    "some non - reducible piss for the system ( [ 2 ] ) are presented .",
    "some concluding remarks are declared at the end of the paper .",
    "in this section , we recall the general procedure for determining piss for an arbitrary system of pdes .",
    "first , we present a brief review of the concept of piss @xcite .",
    "consider a system of pdes of @xmath20th order with @xmath21 independent variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 dependent variables ( @xmath24 ) such as : @xmath25 let @xmath26 be a local symmetry group of the above system which acts on the total space @xmath27 with @xmath28-dimensional orbits . if @xmath29 is a solution of the system ( [ 4 ] ) with graph @xmath30 , then the orbit space of @xmath30 can be defined as follows : @xmath31 which is the union of the orbits of the @xmath30-elements .",
    "+ the defect structure of the solution @xmath29 with respect to the group @xmath26 is computed by the matrix of generators characteristics and is defined as : @xmath32 also , we have @xmath33 ( @xcite , p 276 - 277 ) .",
    "+ if @xmath34 , then @xmath29 is an invariant solution and if @xmath35 , then @xmath29 is a partially invariant solution .    in order to calculate the piss , first of all , it is necessary to classify the symmetry group into conjugacy classes . for obtaining the piss with the defect structure @xmath1 , those subgroups @xmath36 which have the property",
    "that if the dimension of the orbits of @xmath37 on the space @xmath27 is @xmath28 , then the dimension of the orbits is @xmath38 on the space @xmath39 , must be selected @xcite .",
    "let @xmath37 be a subgroup with this property that mentioned above and @xmath40 be its lie algebra with infinitesimal generators @xmath41 .",
    "hence , we can obtain a complete set of functionally independent invariants of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "+ then we have @xmath45 if @xmath29 is a function , then the manifold @xmath46 can be expressed in terms of the invariants ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "so , we have : @xmath47 where the functions @xmath48 are arbitrary .",
    "now , by applying the implicit function theorem , we conclude that @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the remaining dependent variables only depend on the original independent variables : @xmath52 now , the derivatives of the functions @xmath53 with respect to the new variables which are obtained from equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) must be calculated .",
    "hence , by substituting these quantities into the original system , a new system is obtained , involving the @xmath54 functions @xmath48 and the invariants @xmath55 .",
    "the resulted equations are not generally consistent , so that the compatibility conditions must be computed .",
    "consequently , a system of pdes is deduced from these constraints which is denoted by @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "a system of pdes is resulted from ( [ 11 ] ) denoted by @xmath57 .",
    "now , the system @xmath56 must be solved first .",
    "then corresponding to each of the solution of this system , the system @xmath57 will be solved .",
    "finally , the partially invariant solutions are obtained by substituting the resulted solutions into equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) . for more details about the methods of determining",
    "the piss refer to @xcite .",
    "in this section , we want to classify the subgroups of symmetry group of the system ( [ 2 ] ) , into conjugacy classes .",
    "searching for the invariant solutions can be regarded as the main motivation of computing the symmetries of a differential equation . as it is well known , the problem of classifying invariant solutions is equivalent to the problem of classifying the subgroups of the full symmetry group under conjugation",
    ". let @xmath37 and @xmath58 be two connected , @xmath59-dimensional lie subgroups of the lie group @xmath26 with corresponding lie subalgebras @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the lie algebra @xmath62 of @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath63 , then @xmath64 are conjugate subgroups if and only if @xmath65 are conjugate subalgebras , where @xmath66 is adjoint represen hence ,",
    "the problem of determining an optimal system of subgroups is equivalent to that of obtaining an optimal system of subalgebras , and so we focus on it @xcite .",
    "the latter problem , tends to obtain a list of conjugacy inequivalent subalgebras with the property that any other subalgebra is equivalent to only a unique member of the list under some element of the adjoint representation for some element of the investigated lie group .",
    "indeed , for one - dimensional subalgebras , the classification problem is necessarily the same as the problem of classifying the orbits of the adjoint representation .",
    "thus , an optimal set of subalgebras is constructed if we select just one representative from each family of equivalent subalgebras .",
    "consequently , the associated set of invariant solutions is then the minimal list from which we can obtain all other invariant solutions of one - dimensional subalgebras simply via transformations .    in @xcite",
    ", we have presented a comprehensive analysis of this problem and have constructed an optimal system of one - dimensional subalgebras for the system ( [ 2 ] ) as follows :    [ 3.1 ] an optimal system of one - dimensional lie subalgebras of the system ( [ 2 ] ) is provided by the following generators : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 are arbitrary numbers .      in this paper , we need to classify the two - dimensional subalgebras . because , we want to calculate those piss which have the defect structure @xmath0 and the reduced system @xmath56 is a system of ordinary differential equations . since @xmath72 , @xmath0 and @xmath73 , then we have @xmath74 .",
    "so , we should consider the two - dimensional subgroups .",
    "+ consequently , constructing the two - dimensional optimal system , i.e. , classification of the two - dimensional subalgebras of @xmath75 is our next step .",
    "this process is performed by choosing one of the vector fields as stated in theorem ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) .",
    "corresponding to it , an optional vector field @xmath78 is selected , so we must have @xmath79=\\lambda { \\rm{\\bf   x}}^1+\\mu y.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ 13 ] ) leads us to the system @xmath80 where the constant coefficients @xmath81 are the structure constants .",
    "the solutions of the system ( [ 14 ] ) , give one of the two - dimensional generators and the second generator is @xmath82 ( or @xmath77 ) if selected . + after the construction of all two - dimensional subalgebras , for every vector fields of theorem ( [ 3.1 ] ) , they need to be simplified by the action of adjoint transformations in the manner analogous to the way of one - dimensional optimal system .",
    "hence , we can state the following theorem :    [ 3.2 ] any two - dimensional subalgebras of ( [ 3 ] ) is conjugate to precisely one of the following subalgebras :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are arbitrary constants , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 and @xmath86 is @xmath70 or @xmath87 .",
    "each of the two - dimensional subalgebra has two generators . for classifying two - dimensional subalgebras , we must select one of the generators from the list of one - dimensional optimal system ( [ 12 ] ) and another generator must be taken optionally .",
    "+ suppose that @xmath88 is a two - dimensional subalgebra of @xmath75 where @xmath39 is a one - dimensional subalgebra which is chosen from the list ( [ 12 ] ) and @xmath89 is an optional vector defined by : @xmath78 .",
    "now , we must simplify @xmath40 as much as possible by imposing various adjoint transformations on it @xcite .",
    "+ each adjoint transformation is a linear map @xmath90 defined by @xmath91 , for @xmath92 . since this procedure is so lengthy , we only explain one of the cases in the following .",
    "case1 : if @xmath93 then @xmath94 so , we have :    * if @xmath95 , then we have @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97=0=0x_1 + 0x_7 $ ] , then @xmath40 is closed under the lie bracket .",

    "we can make the coefficient of @xmath145 vanish by @xmath146 ; by setting @xmath147 .",
    "also , the coefficient of @xmath110 can be vanished or be @xmath70 by @xmath128 ; by setting @xmath148 .",

    ", we can find the two - dimensional subalgebras for the other 11 cases .",
    "in this section , we will calculate the piss of the system ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "for example , consider the lie subalgebra @xmath155 .",
    "the set of functionally independent invariants for @xmath98 is a set of functions @xmath156 with the following property : @xmath157 . by calculating these functions , a set of functionally independent invariants",
    "is obtained as follows : @xmath158 so , we have : @xmath159 since @xmath160 , then @xmath0 .",
    "the equations corresponding to the relation ( [ 9 ] ) are @xmath161 and the solutions corresponding to the equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) are expressed as follows : @xmath162 note that @xmath163 is an arbitrary function .",
    "+ now , we can compute the derivatives of the functions @xmath164 and @xmath6 from relations ( [ 19 ] ) : @xmath165 hence , by substituting the above relations into the system ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath166 the consistency conditions , obtained from the system ( [ 21 ] ) , conclude the following equations @xmath167 and these inequations @xmath168 equations ( [ 22 ] ) form a system of odes . by solving this system ,",
    "we obtain four types of solutions as follows : @xmath169    now , by applying the relations ( [ 19 ] ) , the partially invariant solutions associated to the subalgebra @xmath98 can be obtained for the system ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath170 these partially invariant solutions seem to be trivial . in a similar way",
    ", we can calculate nontrivial piss by applying other subalgebras listed in theorem ( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "some other of these piss are presented in table 1 .",
    "in this section , we will deal with those partially invariant solutions which are not invariant with respect to some of the subgroups of @xmath26 .",
    "they are called non - reducible piss and they are usually rare . for a reducible partially invariant solution @xmath29 , we can determine a subgroup @xmath171 which @xmath172 is a @xmath173-invariant solution and @xmath174 ( @xcite , page 290 ) .",
    "so , reducible piss can be obtained via the method of similarity reduction from the reduced system involving @xmath175 independent variables , which is indeed easier than obtaining them by piss method .",
    "for example , the piss that we computed in the previous section are non - reducible piss . because , reducible piss must be invariant with respect to the one - parameter subgroups of its lie group .",
    "these subgroups have lie subalgebras of @xmath98 generated by an infinitesimal generator of the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 . in @xcite",
    ", we obtained the invariant solutions of the system ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to this generator by applying the method of similarity reduction : @xmath178 since , none of these solutions is similar to the piss in ( [ 25 ] ) , we conclude that piss in ( [ 25 ] ) are non - reducible piss .",
