    "the quantization of the black hole horizon area and entropy has been a fascinating subject .",
    "the pioneer work can be traced back to bekenstein @xcite with the famous conjecture that the black hole area should be represented by a quantum operator with a discrete spectrum of eigenvalue in a quantum gravity theory . regarding the black hole horizon area as an adiabatic invariant ,",
    "the equidistant area spectrum was obtained @xmath4 with @xmath5 an integer . from the dynamical modes of the classical theory ,",
    "many attempts have been devoted to obtain such equally spaced area spectrum , whereas the spacing may be different from @xmath6 @xcite .    in the respect that a black hole can be determined by a few parameters ( such as mass , charge , and angular momentum ) , they come very close to our notion of elementary particles , especially like the hydrogen atom",
    ". therefore characteristic vibrations of them , known as the quasinormal mode ( qnm ) frequencies @xcite , should play a significant role in black hole physics .",
    "the result is encouraging .",
    "based on bohr s correspondence principle that  transition frequencies at large quantum numbers should equal classical oscillation frequencies \" , hod @xcite connected these classical oscillation frequencies with the real part of the highly damped qnm frequencies .",
    "then he obtained the spacing of the area spectrum @xmath7 for a schwarzschild black hole . on the other hand",
    ", kunstatter @xcite also derived the same area spectrum through the adiabatic invariant .",
    "the similar argument was also used to fix the immirzi parameter by dreyer @xcite .",
    "this rejuvenates a great interest in the investigation of the black hole area and entropy spectra via the interpretation of the qnm frequencies @xcite .",
    "it has been , recently , pointed out by maggiore @xcite that , in high damping limit , the proper frequency of the equivalent harmonic oscillator @xmath8 , which is interpreted as the qnm frequency , should be of the following form @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the real and imaginary parts of the qnm frequency , respectively .",
    "following this idea , the bekenstein s area spectrum will be recovered for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "vagenas and medved @xcite applied this idea to derive the area spectrum of a rotating kerr black hole with the choice of @xmath12 for @xmath13 . the area spectrum calculated with the modified hod s method",
    "is equally spaced with spacing @xmath14 , which agrees with the bekenstein s spacing . while employing the kunstatter s method",
    ", the spectrum is nonequidistant .",
    "and the spacing is angular momentum dependent .",
    "medved @xcite argued that the kunstatter s method requires that the black hole should be far from the extremal one , i.e. , small angular momentum limit . considering this , the area spectra calculated from these two methods",
    "coincide with each other .",
    "equivalently , the entropy spectrum can also be obtained using the bekenstein - hawking entropy / area law @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 with spacing @xmath17 in einstein s gravity . however , when extended these results to the modified gravity theory , the area spectra were found not to be equidistant any more , while the entropy spectra were still in the form as that of the einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , these results have been applied to different black holes @xcite and the same area and entropy spectra were observed .",
    "the spectra can also be found with the quantization of the angular momentum component @xcite , which gives the same results as that obtained from the qnm frequencies .",
    "black hole spectroscopy can also be obtained from the quantum tunneling method @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author argued that the entropy spectrum is @xmath18 with spacing @xmath19 independent of the black hole parameters , gravity theory , and the dimension of the spacetime .",
    "the spacing was also suggested to be the lower bound of the entropy spectrum @xcite .",
    "as we know , the qnm frequencies are determined by solving the perturbation equation with the boundary conditions that only purely outgoing at infinity and ingoing at the horizon . in a black hole background",
    ", null geodesics appear very useful to explain the qnm frequencies @xcite .",
    "the qnm frequencies can be interpreted in terms of the massless particles trapped at the unstable circular null geodesics and slowly leaking out to infinity .",
    "the real part of the qnm frequencies corresponds to the angular velocity at the unstable null geodesics , and the imaginary part is measured by the instability time scale of the orbit . in the eikonal limit ( @xmath20 ) , the qnm frequencies of the black holes approximately read @xmath21 with @xmath22 the angular velocity at the unstable circular null geodesic and @xmath23 lyapunov exponent .",
    "this result is not only valid for a static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat line element in any dimension , but also for the equatorial orbits in the geometry of a rotating myers - perry black hole in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as we will show , can be both expressed in terms of the radius of the unstable circular null geodesics for an arbitrary stationary black hole with the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) .",
    "based on such view of the qnm frequencies , the strong gravitational black hole lensing , high - energy absorption cross section were found to be related to the unstable circular null geodesics @xcite with some impressive results obtained .",
    "it is therefore imperative to find the relation between the thermodynamic quantity of a black hole and the unstable circular null geodesics",
    ". motivated by this idea , in this paper , we aim to study the entropy spectrum of the black holes from such view of the qnm frequencies . employing the hod s method",
    ", we found that the entropy spectrum of an asymptotically flat black hole can be expressed in terms of its unstable circular null geodesics . and",
    "the spacing of the entropy spectrum is found to depend on the charge , spin , and the dimension of the spacetime , which is very different from that of the previous work by using the usual qnm frequencies .",
    "moreover , the result shows that the spacing @xmath24 of the entropy spectrum decreases with the dimension @xmath0 of the spacetime . for @xmath2 , @xmath24 is larger than @xmath1 , while for @xmath3 , it is smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the spacing @xmath24 will be below the low bound obtained from the tunneling method as suggested in @xcite when @xmath0 is larger than 151 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ geodesic ] ,",
    "we investigate the null geodesics of an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "then we get the relationship between the entropy spectrum and the null geodesics . in section",
    "[ static ] , we explore the entropy spectrum in a static and spherically symmetric black hole . and we generalize it to the stationary and axis - symmetric black hole in section [ stationary ] . the final section is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "in this section , we first study the null geodesics of a black hole , and then show the qnm frequencies obtained from the view described above . further , based on such view , we interpret the black hole entropy spectrum through the null geodesics .    here",
    "we assume that the equatorial metric ( @xmath25 ) of a black hole background is in the following simple form @xmath26 which can describe the equatorial plane of a static , spherically symmetric black hole or a stationary , axis - symmetric black hole .",
    "we only require that these metric functions satisfy the following proper asymptotics @xmath27 the geodesics of a massless particle in the equatorial plane of such black hole background ( [ metric0 ] ) can be easily obtained via the lagrangian , which reads @xmath28 the dot over a symbol denotes the ordinary differentation with respect to an affine parameter . the generalized momentum reproduced from this lagrangian is @xmath29 with its components given by @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 is the energy of the particle and @xmath32 is the orbital angular momentum of the particle in the @xmath33 direction measuring by an observer at rest at infinity . solving ( [ pt ] ) and ( [ pphi ] ) , we have the @xmath34-motion and @xmath33-motion @xmath35 the hamiltonian of this system is @xmath36 here @xmath37 are for timelike , null , and spacelike geodesics , respectively . since we focus on the null geodesics , we take @xmath38 . then inserting ( [ tphi0 ] ) into ( [ hh ] ) , we get the @xmath39-motion @xmath40 which can be further rewritten as @xmath41 with the effective potential @xmath42 .",
    "the unstable circular orbit is determined by @xmath43 through the following conditions : @xmath44 the third condition ensures the instability of the orbit . and from the above conditions , it is easy to find that the unstable circular orbit is located at the local maxima of the effective potential .",
    "and the first two conditions yield @xmath45 where the impact parameter @xmath46 , and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath39 . solving ( [ ll ] ) , we get the impact parameter @xmath47 the minimum impact parameter @xmath48 is measured at @xmath49 with @xmath50 the radius of the unstable circular orbit , which satisfies the equation derived from ( [ ll2 ] ) @xmath51 where the down index ",
    "c \" means that these functions are evaluated at @xmath50 .",
    "given the explicit forms of the metric functions , we can obtain the radius of the unstable circular orbit , which corresponds to the largest root of equation ( [ rcir ] ) with the unstable condition satisfied .",
    "for the schwarzschild black hole , we easily get @xmath52 . the lyapunov exponent @xmath23 and angular velocity @xmath22 are two important quantities to measure the property of the unstable circular null geodesics , which are defined as @xmath53 combining by the effective potential and the null geodesics",
    ", we find that @xmath54 with @xmath55 in a compacted form @xmath56 in @xcite , the author showed that , for the @xmath0-dimensional myers - perry black holes , the real part of the qnm frequency , or the angular frequency of the equatorial circular geodesics is the inverse of their impact parameter . here we clearly show that this is a general property and it holds for any stationary , asymptotically flat black hole . inserting the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 into ( [ qnm ] ) , we will get the qnm frequency corresponding to the metric ( [ metric0 ] ) , @xmath57 then the vibrational frequency @xmath58 could be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    according to the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , substituting this vibrational frequency into the clausius relation @xmath62 yields the entropy spectrum @xmath63 with spacing @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the hawking temperature of the black hole . from this expression",
    ", we see that the spacing depends both on the temperature of the black hole and the property of the unstable circular null geodesics . using the bekenstein - hawking entropy / area law @xmath15 , the area spectrum",
    "can also be obtained , which is also obviously dependent of the temperature and the null geodesics .    to close this section",
    ", we would like to remark that , the area and entropy spectra obtained from such view of the qnm frequencies is not only valid for a static and spherically symmetric black hole , but also for a stationary and axis - symmetric black hole with the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) . in order to work out more details about the spectra",
    ", we will apply this method to different black holes in the next of this paper .",
    "in this section , we would like to apply the above method to study the entropy spectrum of the static and spherically symmetric black holes in any dimension .      here",
    ", let us consider a specific example , the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini metric , which is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the line element of the unit @xmath68-dimensional sphere @xmath69 with the usual angular coordinates @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 $ ] ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 denotes the outer horizon radius of the black hole , which is related to the adm mass of the spacetime as @xmath74 with @xmath75 the area of a unite @xmath68-dimensional sphere .",
    "the temperature of this black hole is calculated as @xmath76 note that @xmath77 is proportional to the inverse of the horizon radius , which means a supermassive black hole has a low temperature , while it has strong gravitational effect .",
    "this result holds for any dimension of the spacetime .",
    "next , let us examine the null geodesics of this spacetime .",
    "we only restrict our attention to the equatorial hyperplane defined by @xmath78 with @xmath79",
    ". then the metric reduces to @xmath80 comparing with ( [ metric0 ] ) , we easily get @xmath81 thus , by solving equation ( [ rcir ] ) , the radius of the unstable circular geodesics will be obtained @xmath82 it is worth noting that we always have @xmath83 for any value of @xmath84 . when @xmath2 , we get the usual result that @xmath85 . and",
    "when @xmath86 , the unstable circular orbits radius will approach the horizon .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows @xmath87 thus , the vibrational frequency deduced from ( [ varomega ] ) reads @xmath88 then , the spacing of the entropy spectrum is @xmath89 from this equation , it is clear that the spacing of the entropy spectrum depend on the dimension @xmath0 of the spacetime . and when @xmath86 , we find the spacing monotonically decreases to zero .",
    "we list the spacing of the entropy spectrum for @xmath90 in table [ table1 ] .",
    "one easily learns from the table that , for @xmath2 , the spacing is the largest one with @xmath91 .",
    "however this spacing will be smaller than @xmath1 when @xmath3 .",
    "therefore this result is very different from these obtained in the previous work from the usual qnm frequencies , where the spacing is @xmath1 and independent of the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we are aware that the spacing @xmath24 will be below the low bound obtained from the tunneling method as suggested in @xcite for @xmath92 .",
    ".the spacing of the black hole entropy spectrum for different values of the dimension @xmath0 of the spacetime . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      it is natural to speculate that the presence of the charge will dramatically change the spacing of the entropy spectrum for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "so it is worth to examine , the charged reissner - nordstr@xmath93 m black hole in any dimension .",
    "the line element describing this spacetime is in the same form as ( [ sch ] ) , while with different metric function @xmath94 where the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are linked to the mass @xmath97 and charge @xmath98 as @xmath99 solving @xmath100 , we get the horizons located at @xmath101 from this equation , we note that there may exist two horizons for @xmath102 , one horizon for @xmath103 , or no horizon for @xmath104 . here",
    "we are only interesting in the noextremal black hole with outer horizon @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the temperature of the outer horizon is @xmath106 in the equatorial hyperplane , the reduced metric has the form of ( [ rnreduce ] ) with @xmath107 given by ( [ rn ] ) .",
    "the radius of the unstable circular orbit is calculated as @xmath108 for @xmath2 , we have @xmath109 , which implies that in the range @xmath110 , the naked singularity located at @xmath111 is surrounded by a photon sphere rather than a horizon . a simple calculation shows @xmath112 then the spacing of the entropy spectrum is @xmath113 for a clear view , we plot this spacing in figure [ prn ] for different values of @xmath0 and the dimensionless charge parameter @xmath114 .",
    "when @xmath115 , the result will reduce to the schwarzschild black hole case .",
    "although the spacing depends on the charge @xmath114 , however from the figure , we find that the spacing for the same @xmath0 varies very slowly in the small charge case .",
    "when the dimensionless charge parameter @xmath114 approaches one , the black hole will approach an extremal one , and the spacing blows up mainly due to the vanishing temperature of the extremal black hole .",
    "m black holes as a function of the dimensionless charge parameter @xmath114 for @xmath116 from top to bottom.,width=302 ]",
    "in the above section , we consider the static , spherically symmetric black holes .",
    "the result shows that the spacing of the entropy spectrum depends on the dimension @xmath0 and dimensionless charge @xmath114 of the black holes .",
    "and the spacing is larger than @xmath1 for @xmath2 , and smaller than @xmath1 for @xmath3 in small charge , which is very different from the result obtained through the usual qnm frequencies . in this section",
    ", we will generalize this method to the stationary and axis - symmetric black holes : four - dimensional kerr black holes and @xmath0-dimensional myers - perry black holes .      in boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the four - dimensional kerr metric is expressed as @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 . here",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath120 are the mass and spin of the black hole , respectively .",
    "it is well known that this black hole has two horizons determined by @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "when @xmath123 , there is the outer horizon @xmath105 endowed with a temperature @xmath124 in the equatorial plane , the metric is of the general form ( [ metric0 ] ) with metric functions given by @xmath125 note that when the spin @xmath120 approaches 0 , the kerr black hole will reduce to a schwarzschild black hole . and in the equatorial plane , we have a vanishing @xmath126 . solving ( [ rcir ] ) , we get the circular orbit radius @xmath127 here , the upper sign is for the corotating orbit , while the lower sign is for the counterrotating orbit .",
    "it is also worth noting that the counterrotating orbit is located far away from the horizon than the corotating orbit .",
    "then we are allowed to calculate the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath55 , @xmath128 }        { r_{c}^{3}(r_{c}-2m)^{2}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath129",
    ". then we get the spacing of the entropy spectrum @xmath130 the behavior of this spacing is shown in figure [ pkerr ] .",
    "if we restrict our attention to the far from extremal black hole , i.e. , in the neighborhood of @xmath131 , one easily obtains a spacing larger than @xmath1 . and",
    "when @xmath131 , it reduces to the schwarzschild black hole case in @xmath2 . on the other hand , one can find that for a kerr black hole with spin @xmath132 , there exist two unstable circular null geodesics , the counterrotating orbit and corotating orbit , which implies that there are two sets of the qnm frequencies , and two different entropy spectra will be obtained .",
    "thus the entropy spectrum obtained in this way is seems to depend on the sign of the orbit angular momentum of the massless particle .",
    "however , it is not the case . in @xcite",
    ", the authors clearly showed that there exist two distinct sets of the qnm frequencies for nearly extremal kerr black holes . here",
    "we can conjecture that this result is also held for an arbitrary rotating black hole . and",
    "these two distinct sets could be interpreted with the counterrotating and corotating orbits , respectively .",
    "so the entropy spectra obtained from the counterrotating and corotating orbits are in fact calculated with the two distinct sets of qnm frequencies .",
    "therefore the spectra have no relation with the sign of the orbit angular momentum . from figure [ pkerr ]",
    ", one easily finds that the spacing related to the counterrotating orbit has the smaller value than the corotating one , which can be understood as that the spacing related to the counterrotating orbit may more approach the minimum spacing of the black hole entropy .          in this subsection",
    ", we would like to generalize this method to these black holes with spin in higher dimensions .",
    "in @xcite , myers and perry found a general black hole solution in asymptotically flat spacetime in @xmath0 dimensions with all @xmath133 @xmath134 nonvanishing . here , we only consider the simple case that only a non - zero spin @xmath135 , therefore the metric can be written as @xmath136 with @xmath119 and @xmath137 .",
    "the parameters @xmath138 and @xmath120 are related to the black hole mass and angular momentum in the following forms @xmath139 the outer horizon is determined as the largest root of @xmath140 , which gives @xmath141 for @xmath2 , it reduces to the kerr black hole with @xmath142 . and for @xmath143",
    ", we easily get @xmath144 .",
    "thus these two black hole cases are bounded with a maximum spin @xmath145 . while when @xmath146 , there is an interesting result that the spin @xmath120 of the black hole could be arbitrary large , which is referred as the  ultra - spinning \" black hole .",
    "however , here we only consider the small @xmath120 limit .",
    "the black hole temperature is calculated as @xmath147 in the equatorial hyperplane , the metric is of the general form ( [ metric0 ] ) with metric functions given by @xmath148 the radius of the circular orbit is determined by ( [ rcir ] ) , which leads to @xmath149 generally , this equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "however for small @xmath0 , the exact result can be obtained . for @xmath2",
    ", it reduces to the kerr case . and",
    "for @xmath143 , we get @xmath150 for counterrotating and corotating orbits , respectively . the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath55 are @xmath151 finally , in the small @xmath120 limit , we can expand the spacing of the entropy spectrum as @xmath152 the first term will go back to the schwarzschild black hole case if @xmath138 , @xmath50 and @xmath73 take the values as that of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the second term looks like a corrected term from the spin @xmath120 of the black hole .",
    "the spacing for @xmath3 is plotted against the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath153 in figure [ pmp ] .",
    "it shares the same behavior as the kerr black hole .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the spacing gets lower and lower , however the line becomes flat in high dimensions . in summary , we still obtain a spacing smaller than @xmath1 in the small @xmath120 limit for @xmath3 .     for @xmath154 from top to bottom.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we show that the qnm frequencies of an asymptotically flat black hole in any dimension can be understood from the null geodesics .",
    "the physical view is thought that the qnm frequencies can be interpreted in terms of the massless particles trapped at the unstable circular null geodesics and slowly leaking out to infinity .",
    "the real part of the qnm frequencies is found to be the inverse of their impact parameter @xmath48 measured at the unstable circular null geodesics , and the imaginary part is @xmath155 .    then using the new physical interpretation of qnm frequencies proposed by maggiore",
    ", we calculate the quantum spectrum of the entropy for different black holes following the hod s method .",
    "the result can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the spacing of the entropy spectrum is dependent of the dimension @xmath0 of the spcetime .",
    "it decreases with @xmath0 , and the largest spacing is @xmath156 for @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath92 , the low bound of the spacing @xmath24 as suggested in @xcite will be violated , and when @xmath157 , the spacing will vanish .",
    "\\(ii ) for a far from extremal black hole , the value of the spacing of the entropy spectrum is found to be larger than @xmath1 for @xmath2 and smaller than @xmath1 for @xmath3 , which is very different from these obtained from the previous work @xcite ( and references therein ) by using the usual qnm frequencies .    in summary , since the spacing of the entropy spectrum in this paper is expressed in terms of the hawking temperature and null geodesics of the black holes , this method is therefore justify to extend to other stationary black holes in non - einstein gravity , and we conjecture that our result is universal .",
