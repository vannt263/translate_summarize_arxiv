    "far ultraviolet radiation incident on a cloud of molecular material dissociates molecules , giving rise to a surface layer of largely atomic material , called a photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",
    "when a hot star is located near a molecular cloud , much of the star s radiant output is absorbed and reprocessed in the resulting pdr .",
    "dust in the pdr efficiently absorbs uv photons , which results in thermal ir emission .",
    "the warm gas cools via forbidden transitions in metal atoms and ions and via rovibrational transitions in h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the conditions in pdrs are probed observationally by ir studies .",
    "many theoretical pdr models have been developed , and include quantitative determinations of ir diagnostics ( e.g. tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ; see also the review by hollenbach & tielens 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the detailed understanding of pdrs will yield information on the structure of molecular clouds and their interaction with young stars , and thus ultimately on the process of star formation .",
    "as discussed by draine & bertoldi in this volume , observations with the iso short wavelength spectrometer have yielded the h@xmath0 rotational distribution functions in pdrs , from which surprisingly high values of gas temperature ( 500  1000  k ) have been inferred .",
    "it is not yet clear what heating processes are able to maintain the gas at such high temperatures .",
    "photoelectric emission from dust grains is expected to be a major mechanism , but calculated heating rates are inadequate .",
    "here we consider the possibility of enhanced dust - to - gas ratios in pdrs , which would imply increased photoelectric heating rates .",
    "enhanced dust - to - gas ratios can result when grains drift with respect to the gas .",
    "we will begin by describing the motion of the gas ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "ionizing radiation from the hot star located near the molecular cloud ( mc ) photoevaporates material at the cloud surface , which then expands into the intercloud medium in a photoevaporative flow ( pf ) .",
    "thus , the ionization front propagates into the cloud . in our analysis",
    ", we adopt the frame of reference in which the ionization front is stationary ; in this frame material flows through the pdr .",
    "if no other forces acted on the grains , they would simply be dragged along by the gas . however , there are forces associated with the anisotropic stellar uv radiation field .",
    "in addition to the usual `` radiation pressure '' force due to absorption and scattering ( @xmath1 ) , there are also recoil forces , due to photoemitted electrons ( @xmath2 ) and due to photodesorbed adatoms and h@xmath0 molecules which form on the grain surface ( @xmath3 ) . as a consequence of these `` radiative '' forces , the grains drift with respect to the gas , at speed @xmath4 .",
    "if the gas moves at speed @xmath5 with respect to the ionization front then the grains move at speed @xmath6 .",
    "deep within the pdr , where the stellar uv has been attenuated , @xmath7 .",
    "the grain overdensity near the ionization front is obtained using the continuity equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the grain number density deep within the pdr ( near the ionization front ) and @xmath11 is the drift speed near the ionization front ; we assume one - dimensional flow and ignore magnetic fields .",
    "since the drag force is roughly proportional to the drift speed , the overdensity is also given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sum of the radiative forces near the ionization front and @xmath14 is the magnitude of the radiative force which would result in @xmath15 ( in which case the grains would be stopped near the ionization front ) .",
    "throughout , we assume spherical grains , so that mie theory can be applied for the grain optics .",
    "the radiation pressure force is given by @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the grain radius , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the radiation energy density per frequency interval , and @xmath20 is the usual scattering asymmetry factor .",
    "we compute the absorption and scattering efficiency factors , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , using a mie theory code derived from bhmie ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) with dielectric functions as described by draine & lee ( 1984 ) and laor & draine ( 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt a physical model for the photoelectric emission process ( see bakes & tielens 1994 , weingartner & draine 1999a ) .",
    "of course , the photoemission rate and the total energy of the emitted electrons depend on the grain s ionization potential , @xmath23 ; for simplicity we take the electron energy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the energy of the absorbed photon .",
    "the ionization potential depends on the grain charge ; the charge distribution is determined by the rates of electron attachment by accretion from the gas and removal by photoemission .",
    "thus , the average photoelectric force depends on the ambient conditions ; including the spectrum and energy density of the radiation and the gas density , ionization , and temperature ; through their effects on the charge distribution . for a fixed charge state ,",
    "the force is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the photoelectric yield , the emission asymmetry factor @xmath29 measures the asymmetry in the emission of photoelectrons over the grain surface , the recoil suppression factor @xmath30 accounts for electron emission in directions other than the surface normal , and @xmath31 is the electron mass .",
    "we follow the simple prescription of kerker & wang ( 1982 ) for determining the asymmetry factor @xmath32 .",
    "the probability of photoemission from any site on the surface is taken to be proportional to the electric intensity @xmath33 just below the surface at that point .",
    "thus , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the polar angle with respect to the direction of the incident radiation . in figure 2",
    "we display @xmath36 as a function of incident photon energy for graphite grains of various sizes .",
    "in determining the recoil suppression factor @xmath30 we assume that the electrons emerge symmetrically with respect to the local surface normal , with a `` cosine - law '' angular distribution ( i.e.  the emission rate at angle @xmath37 with respect to the surface normal @xmath38 ) .",
    "for an uncharged grain , this would imply @xmath39 .",
    "when the grain is charged , the electron escapes on a hyperbolic trajectory , so that when it is at infinity its velocity vector makes an angle @xmath40 with respect to the surface normal which differs from the corresponding angle at the surface , @xmath37 .",
    "see weingartner & draine ( 1999b ) for the detailed calculation .",
    "in our simple model , we consider the exchange of hydrogen between the gas phase and the grain surface .",
    "we assume that the surface is entirely covered with chemisorption sites , as would be the case for bare graphite or silicate grains without ice mantles .",
    "when a gas phase h atom strikes the grain surface , it arrives either at an empty site or at a site which is already occupied by an adsorbed h atom . in the former case ,",
    "it occupies the site with some sticking probability ; otherwise it reflects and remains in the gas phase . in the latter case",
    ", it recombines with the resident h with some recombination probability ; otherwise it reflects and remains in the gas phase .",
    "we assume that h@xmath0 formed on the grain surface is immediately ejected from the grain .",
    "adatoms are removed from the grain surface via recombination and photodesorption .",
    "suppose that the grain s spin axis is aligned with the direction of the radiation anisotropy .",
    "since the photodesorption rate is greater in the illuminated hemisphere than in the non - illuminated hemisphere , relatively more h leaves the surface as atoms in the former and as molecules in the latter .",
    "a net recoil force is expected , for two reasons .",
    "first , the total number of particles leaving the illuminated hemisphere exceeds that for the non - illuminated hemisphere .",
    "second , the outgoing atoms likely carry a different momentum than the outgoing molecules .",
    "a net recoil force of zero is possible , but only if the momenta and sticking and recombination probabilities conspire to have the right values .",
    "the photodesorption force is greater when the spin axis makes a non - zero angle with respect to the radiation direction , since h which arrives at non - illuminated sites can be transported to illumination and photodesorbed . for a fuller discussion of the adopted values for relevant parameters and the details of the calculation , see weingartner & draine ( 1999b )",
    "timmermann et  al . ( 1996 ) studied the pdr associated with the s140 h@xmath41ii region using iso and concluded that the gas temperature is @xmath42  k. we have evaluated the radiative forces for graphite and silicate grains and the conditions in this pdr . to determine @xmath14",
    ", we employed the expression for @xmath43 in draine & salpeter ( 1979 ) and evaluated @xmath5 using a highly simplified model for the flow in the pdr ; see weingartner & draine ( 1999b ) for details .",
    "we display the ratios of the radiative forces to @xmath14 , as a function of grain size , in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "for the s140 pdr , the forces associated with the anisotropic radiation are apparently large enough to result in significant grain overdensities .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the total radiative force is highly uncertain , due to uncertainties in the microphysics of the photoemission and photodesorption processes .",
    "our program of study will include an examination of more pdrs and also simulations of the dynamics which result when @xmath44 ; i.e.when the grains near the ionization front are actually pushed deeper into the pdr . in this case , the further upstream a grain is pushed , the less effective the push , because the radiation is attenuated by other grains downstream . also , we will add magnetic fields to the analysis . finally , of course , we will estimate the implications for gas heating .",
