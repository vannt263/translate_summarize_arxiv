    "the topological states in haldane - model - like systems are also called as quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) states or chern insulators ( cis ) .",
    "based on the understanding of the ci / qah states , and considering the strongly correlated fermionic or bosonic systems , possible fqah states or fractional chern insulators ( fcis ) can be further conceptually defined  @xcite . in the absence of an external magnetic field , the topological flat bands ( tfbs )",
    "@xcite in ci / qah systems play the role of lls , and can also host the intriguing fractionalization phenomena .",
    "since the tfbs quench the kinetic energy of particles very effectively , addition of moderate interactions push the fractionally filled ci / qah systems into the strongly correlated fractional topological phases .",
    "some numerical works have systematically explored the interaction effects within the tfb models , and have firmly established the existence of fci / fqah states  @xcite .",

    "laughlin  @xcite used the lowest - landau - level ( lll ) single - particle wave functions with conserved angular momenta to construct the many - body wave function analytically for the fqh states on disk geometry .",
    "then some other works pointed out the wave functions can also be constructed for continuous systems on different geometries like a sphere , a torus or a cylinder  @xcite .",
    "later works found that the laughlin wave function can be decomposed with the help of the jack symmetric polynomial ( jacks )  @xcite , which naturally reflects the generalized pauli principle ( gpp )  @xcite in the fock space for both the abelian and the non - abelian fqh states .",
    "just as the pauli exclusion principle corresponds to the fermi statistics , the gpp corresponds to the fractional statistics of anyons .",

    "in contrast to the above analytical or semi - analytical approaches , we here pursue a very direct yet effective purely numerical prescription to construct fci / fqah states on disk geometry , without any variational parameter or adjustable gauge freedom , but just utilizing the powerful gpp and the jacks structure of fqh states , and the information from exact numerical single - particle orbitals of tfb models .    in this paper",

    "we firstly construct the finite - size lattices on disk geometry and diagonalize the non - interacting hamiltonian matrix to obtain the single - particle ci / qah wave functions , then use the gpp  @xcite and the jacks  @xcite to construct the fci / fqah wave functions for interacting spinless fermions . in order to test the feasibility of the many - body wave functions of fci / fqah states ,",
