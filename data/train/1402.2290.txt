    "in the current standard cosmological model , the large scale structures observed in the universe originated from small fluctuations present in the matter density field arising after the inflationary phase shortly after the big bang . although slow - roll inflation models predict this random field to be essentially gaussian @xcite , other evolutionary models after inflation predict a non - vanishing non - gaussian component in the primordial matter density field @xcite .",
    "the detection of non - gaussianity could open a new window in the knowledge of early universe physics .",
    "the most widely used method so far to constrain primordial non - gaussianity is to measure the bi - spectrum in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy maps .",
    "recently , this method was applied to planck data @xcite to provide the best measurement of local non - gaussianity up to date ( @xmath7 ) , with the growth factor normalized to unity today , this value should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath8 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "non - gaussianity is to measure its impact on large scale structure ( lss ) at lower redshifts @xcite which affects the bias of dark matter tracers .",
    "large galaxy surveys have been the probe of choice to constrain the clustering properties of dark matter on large scales and measure this non - gaussian effect @xcite .",
    "given the fact that this non - gaussian signal is specially sensitive on large scales , other type of surveys , based on intensity mapping techniques , have been suggested to go after this effect @xcite .",
    "although observing large scales has the advantage of probing the regime where the non - gaussian effect on the bias of the dark matter tracers is stronger , it has the problem that it is nonetheless limited by cosmic variance , e.g. , the lack of enough independent measurements for the scales we are trying to probe , given the limited size of the volume that is observed .",
    "@xcite proposed a way to get around this cosmic variance limitation by using different biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution . with at least two tracers with different bias",
    ", we can make a measurement of the ratio of these two biases that is only limited by shot noise and hence beats cosmic variance .",
    "this is specially sensitive when the bias of one object is much larger than the other . in order to understand this ,",
    "let us assume that we measure two density maps at a given redshift , one for a biased tracer and another for the dark matter itself .",
    "due to cosmic variance , there will be several power spectra ( e.g. several cosmologies ) that are consistent with the dark matter map .",
    "however , the ratio of the two maps should give a direct measurement of the bias , with an uncertainty just given by the shot noise of the tracer .",
    "in this paper we propose to use the mass of the haloes hosting the dark matter tracers as an extra source of information in order to constrain the bias .",
    "this will have 3 advantages : 1 ) it will allow us to select objects with large bias factors ( without any mixture with low mass objects ) making them more sensitive to the non - gaussian effect ; 2 ) it will allow us to compare directly the bias of different tracers in order to cancel cosmic variance and 3 ) it will allow us to have a more physical description of the bias parameters used in the analysis .",
    "although this idea can be applied to different surveys , it can be particularly relevant to radio galaxy surveys , given that they usually lack redshift information but on the other hand should provide a more direct relation between bias and mass . in here we concentrate on surveys that can be achieved with the ska ( http://www.skatelescope.org ) and its pathfinders .",
    "the outline for this work is the following : in sec .",
    "2 we describe how to model non - gaussian features in lss bias , and their mass dependence . in sec .",
    "3 we present the forecasts for future radio surveys , focusing on the improvement of the constraints on @xmath9 when using tracers of different masses with standard angular power spectrum measurements . in sec . 4",
    ", we show how to improve these constraints by eliminating cosmic variance using multi tracer bias . finally , in sec .",
    "5 we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",
    "in most standard inflationary scenarios , non - gaussianity in the primordial fluctuation field is characterized by a local feature of the bardeen gauge invariant potential @xmath10 , which is expressed as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a random gaussian field and @xmath9 is a constant that defines the amplitude of non - gaussianity . on sub - horizon scales ,",
    "the bardeen potential simply becomes the opposite of the gravitational potential . in terms of large scale structure clustering in the universe ,",
    "the main consequence of such deviation from a gaussian field is to increase power on large scales in 2-point statistics such as the tridimensional power spectrum of clustered objects .",
    "a scale dependent correction appears in the total halo bias : @xcite @xmath13\\frac{3 \\omega_m h_0 ^ 2}{c^2 k^2 t(k )",
    "d(z ) } \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] the total halo bias thus depends on the non - gaussianity amplitude @xmath9 , the critical overdensity for spherical collapse @xmath14 , at redshift z=0 , as well as the linear transfer ( @xmath15 ) and growth ( @xmath16 ) functions ( with @xmath17 ) .",
    "this correction is placed upon the usual gaussian linear bias , which assumes the expression : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this model was first proposed in @xcite and @xcite obtained the values for the parameters which better fit numerical simulations of dark matter collapse and galaxy formation , finding @xmath21 and @xmath22 .      for a given tracer with bias @xmath23 , the total 3d halo power spectrum is then simply @xmath24 ( on large scales ) , where @xmath25 is the underlying dark matter power spectrum .",
    "if no redshift information is available to compute the 3d power spectrum , the adequate estimator to use is the angular power spectrum , where the distribution of halos along the line of sight is projected over the 2d field of view .",
    "if several tracers are considered , the total statistical information is described by the auto and cross correlation power spectra .",
    "the result consists in a set of multipole values @xmath26 and the full computation reads @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a window function which accounts for the clustering properties of a given biased tracer @xmath29 and the angular geometry for a given multipole @xmath30 : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the angular redshift distribution of sources normalized to unity , @xmath33 is the comoving radial distance to redshift @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the spherical bessel functions of order @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    as shown in the previous section , the total scale dependent correction introduced by non - gaussianity in halo clustering ( @xmath36 ) depends on the redshift and also on the mass of the halo . in the absence of non - gaussianity",
    ", this mass dependence simply translates into an increased amplitude in the power spectrum or correlation function for more massive halos / galaxies when compared to lower mass objects .",
    "however , if non - gaussianity is present , the mass dependence of the linear bias in eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] will introduce different scale dependence features in clustering 2-point statistics .",
    "more massive halos will then be more sensitive to non - gaussianity than lower mass ones . fig",
    "1 shows this effect for different values of @xmath9 and halo mass for the 3d halo power spectrum .",
    "one can clearly see the differential effect of using mass bins , with the effect being significant only for @xmath37 less than 0.02 @xmath38mpc@xmath39 , and having a relative amplitude up to order 1 order of magnitude .",
    "such features offers the possibility to obtain additional information on @xmath9 by constructing observational 2-point statistics from objects corresponding to different halo mass ranges . in order to exploit this",
    ", we need to address the issue of differentiating halo masses from an observational point of view .",
    "most of the studies done to constrain clustering properties of dark matter are based on large surveys of galaxies or clusters that trace the distribution of matter over large scales in the universe . a key issue when modeling the data obtained from lss surveys is to know how galaxies populate dark matter halos .",
    "this is a complex issue since galaxy formation involves non - linear collapse inside the collapsed halos and there is also the possibility of merging form different sized halos .",
    "one way to address this issue is to adopt the halo model @xcite which assumes an halo occupation distribution function ( hod ) to compute the galaxy power spectrum . in this framework ,",
    "all the information about the mass dependent features is compressed into a few free parameters such as the minimum mass of haloes that can contain galaxies as observed in a survey .",
    "the halo model is a very useful tool to accurately compute the galaxy power spectrum into the non - linear scales , but by incorporating all types of galaxies in the hod the information on halo mass at large scales is not taken into account .",
    "another way to access the halo clustering properties is to consider specific populations of galaxies and clusters which allow the elimination of the one - halo contribution to the power spectrum , and thus more directly trace each object with its underlying dark matter halo .",
    "a typical example are the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , a population of old and relaxed galaxies expected to be free from recent merger activity .",
    "such properties justify the use of these objects to reconstruct the halo density field @xcite and use the resulting power spectrum to constrain cosmological models @xcite including the presence of non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "however , even with this analysis , it is not possible to differentiate the mass of the halos associated with lrgs and constraining @xmath9 is done by means of an effective bias , corresponding to a weighted averaged bias over the mass range expected for halos hosting a given galaxy type ( e.g. lrgs ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the halo mass function .",
    "the above equation has been used to place constraints on non - gaussian bias using 3d power spectrum from large available datasets and thus reducing the shot noise component at the expense of some loss of information on @xmath9 .    .",
    "when combining populations , the bias is obtained through eq .",
    "[ eq:11].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      a different approach is to consider other specific galaxy populations whose bias properties can be explained by a strong correlation between halo mass and galaxy type .",
    "this seems to be the case for some types of radio galaxies , such as radio - quiet and radio - loud agns , including fri and frii galaxies @xcite , and also star - forming galaxies , including starbursts .",
    "the idea of assigning a single halo mass to these objects was introduced by @xcite ( w08 ) in a framework to produce realistic sets of data of the extragalactic sky to be observed with the next generation of radio telescopes .",
    "indeed , for low redshifts the ( scale independent ) bias obtained using the formalism presented in section 2.2 with a single halo mass for each population is compatible with the clustering measurements obtained from the nvss @xcite and first @xcite surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass to be assigned to each galaxy type is thoroughly discussed in section 2.7 of w08 . based on different observational features and luminosity relations derived from several clustering studies for each population ( we report the reader to the references presented in w08 ) the authors propose to take the following halo masses :    * star forming galaxies ( sfr ) : m@xmath42=@xmath43 * starbursts ( sb ) : m@xmath42=@xmath44 * radio quiet quasars ( rqq ) : m@xmath42=@xmath45 * radio loud agn ( fri ) : m@xmath42=@xmath46 * radio loud agn ( frii ) : m@xmath42=@xmath47    in w08 , the authors also argued for the introduction of some type of upper limit in the bias of a given population .",
    "the argument was that without such limit the bias would become too large at high redshifts .",
    "however , there is not enough theoretical evidence supporting such an abrupt cut on the bias at a given redshift .",
    "different numerical simulations @xcite suggest that the peak biased formalism of eqs .",
    "[ eq:2 ] and [ eq:3 ] is valid at least up to z@xmath48 for a wide range of masses .",
    "we will therefore in our study consider no restrictions in the bias evolution when computing the angular power spectrum predictions ( which is what we need for the calculation ) , on the other hand , does not show this dramatic increase with z. ] .",
    "although this model can describe the observed bias for a significant redshift range , it is obviously subject to a degree of uncertainty .",
    "it is obvious that attributing a single halo mass to these large galaxy population types is a very strong assumption and can not be correct in physical terms . in order to have a more plausible distribution for the halo mass associated with each population",
    ", we consider a gaussian distribution of masses around the central mass values , with a standard deviation of 20@xmath49 of the central mass @xmath50 , which will be considered as a free parameter for each population .",
    "the mass values presented above will be considered as fiducial values . in this framework",
    ", the linear bias for each population can be reduced to : @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the gaussian distribution of masses mentioned above and @xmath53 the linear bias from eq .",
    "the choice of function here should in principle depend on the probability of a halo of a given mass to generate a given observed galaxy type as well as on the halo mass function itself .",
    "we take the simple approach here of using a gaussian noting that , as seen later on , the actual shape of the function does not affect the constraints .",
    "using this model one can study the impact of the mass values in the constraints of @xmath9 via eqs .",
    "[ eq:12 ] , [ eq:2 ] and [ eq:3 ] .",
    "we discussed above how radio galaxies can trace the mass of their host halos and thus be used to differentiate populations of halos in order to constrain primordial non - gaussianity models .",
    "radio surveys also have the advantage to cover a large fraction of the sky in a relatively small amount of time , with the potential to detect objects up to very high redshifts",
    ". however , the sensitivity required to determine redshifts from the 21-cm hi emission line makes it difficult to use the data of these surveys to compute the 3d power spectrum on large scales until the full ska ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but see @xcite . therefore , we will focus on the angular power spectrum that will be measured by future continuum surveys .",
    "due to their high sensitivity , experiments conducted by the ska and its precursors / pathfinders , such as lofar and wodan on apertif @xcite , mightee on meerkat @xcite and emu on askap @xcite , are expected to detect galaxies up to @xmath54 with a large redshift distribution . in this section ,",
    "we present forecasts on the constraints obtained from the angular auto and cross correlation power spectra that can be measured using samples of different galaxy types .",
    "the forecasts were performed using the fisher matrix formalism ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fisher information matrix allows the computation of the expected errors on the parameters of a given model assuming that the likelihood function near the best fit model is approximated by a multivariate gaussian .",
    "it also allows us to include different datasets , observables and models in a consistent way .",
    "the full fisher matrix , when using multi - tracers is then the sum of the fisher matrices for each multipole : @xmath55 in the above expression the matrix @xmath56(\\ell)$ ] contains all the auto and cross angular power elements corresponding to tracers @xmath29 and @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a given parameter of the model to be constrained . for the fiducial cosmological model",
    ", we considered a standard @xmath59 obtained from the latest planck release @xcite , sdss lrg power spectrum and h@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "since the only cosmological parameters that can be potentially degenerate with the non - gaussian bias are the matter density @xmath61 , hubble parameter @xmath62 and primordial fluctuation amplitude @xmath63 , these were introduced in the fisher matrix as free parameters in order to make a consistent analysis , adding at the same time a fisher matrix corresponding to the covariance matrix for these parameters obtained by the same combination of data mentioned above .",
    "finally , we added the local non - gaussianity parameter @xmath9 and the central mass for each galaxy population @xmath64 describing the halo mass distribution .",
    "as for the dispersion of these distributions , a fixed value of 0.2 was taken , corresponding to 20@xmath49 of the central mass value for each population .",
    "the full parameter set used in the fisher analysis was then @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the model presented in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] was applied to compute the @xmath67 and the covariance matrix @xmath68 was considered to follow : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the noise power spectrum for a given galaxy population which is determined by @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the number of sources per steradian in the sky .",
    "this last expression also assumes that all the systematics inherent to each survey are sub - dominant to the cosmic variance and shot noise contributions .      in the fisher matrix formalism , the constraining ability of an experiment for a given parameter is determined by the model dependence on the parameter and the covariance matrix of the observational data .",
    "more precisely , if the inverse of the covariance matrix has sufficiently large diagonal elements , the precision that can be attained on a parameter can reach sub - percentage levels .",
    "the fisher matrix used above is derived assuming that the measurements are the maps themselves , e.g. the likelihood function is the probability distribution of the @xmath73 , the spherical harmonic transform of the galaxy number densities observed on the sky . since we are comparing maps with different bias ,",
    "the possible cancellation of cosmic variance in the bias measurement due to the use of multiple tracers is already implicitly included in the formalism .",
    "as an illustration , one can consider a hypothetical `` perfect '' experiment measuring two galaxy populations with enough sensitivity so that the shot noise contribution to eq .",

    "we illustrate this effect considering a case with @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for a halo mass of @xmath82 given by eqs .",
    "[ eq:2 ] and [ eq:3 ] .",
    "we used a generic wide redshift distribution extending up to z=6 with a peak at z=1 .",

    "iii ) using information from both populations as in eq . [ matrix_cov2 ] , where the improvement is dramatic , with a constraint of @xmath85 . by including different biased tracers in the same data analysis one can indeed significantly improve the constraints on @xmath9 and avoid the cosmic variance limitation . this happens because we are observing the same sky for both populations and the main difference in the clustering of dark matter and galaxies will be the non - gaussianity induced boost at large scales .",
    "this effect was first introduced by @xcite and further explored in @xcite , both focusing on the 3d power spectra for galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "the example presented above is somehow pedagogical , and in reality the window function for two different populations will not be proportional and hence the cosmic variance cancellation effect will be somehow diminished . in the following section we focus on quantifying the constraints that can be put on @xmath9 by future experiments using realistic modeling for both bias and galaxy distributions .",
    "the key to use the multi - tracer analysis presented in this paper is the ability to identify the galaxy populations using observational features in a given radio galaxy survey .",
    "starting with radio - loud agn , these can be divided into fri or frii radio galaxies , which can be distinguished by the presence of coaxial lobes of emission which are offset from the core and present emission hot spots in the lobes edges ( frii ) and those where the lobes are connected to the core by jets and present a more diffuse surface brightness ( fri ) @xcite .",
    "such distinction can be made only with a sufficient angular resolution experiment that allows to identify these morphological differences .",
    "following @xcite , the typical size of the gap between the lobes is modeled as @xmath86mpc .",
    "this implies an angular resolution of about 1 arcsec at worst to distinguish fri and frii galaxies at high redshifts such as z=4 .",
    "this requirement means that such a study is possibly only feasible with phase i of the ska itself , given that the various precursor and pathfinder surveys all have substantially poorer resolution than this ( i.e. @xmath87  arcsec in the case of meerkat and 10 - 15  arcsec for emu and wodan , although lofar could potentially reach 1  arcsec resolution with inclusion of the longer baselines ) .",
    "phase i of the ska will also have extremely high sensitivity to diffuse emission due to the envisaged compact core , thus providing the necessary baselines to probe all spatial scales associated with agn in a single survey .",
    "as for star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) and starbursts , it is be extremely difficult to distinguish them with radio data alone , as the only distinction is in their star formation rates which are difficult to access without redshift information for the individual sources .",
    "other sensitive issue is the distinction of radio quiet agns and sfg / sb galaxies .",
    "multi - wavelength studies on different deep fields suggest that radio quiet quasars may account for almost half of the sources observed at a level of a few @xmath3jy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the exact identification of this source type in a large continuum survey may require a multi - wavelength analysis , in particular , future x - ray surveys such as erosita ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since the goal of the present paper is to lay the foundations of this multi - tracer analysis method , we will consider and present forecasts for the cases where rqq , sfg and sb could be successfully distinguished and also where they have to be merged into different population combinations .",
    "for this case , the total bias of a merged sample becomes ( from eq .",

    "one should note however that the practical application of such method is prone to other systematic uncertainties , the main one being the capability to correctly identify each galaxy type .",
    "the results obtained in the present paper show that radio surveys can reach and possibly surpass the level of precision obtained with cmb data and approach the point where non - gaussianity can be ruled out with more confidence or even be detected at level expected for most inflationary models .",

    "<S> we explore the use of different radio galaxy populations as tracers of different mass halos and therefore , with different bias properties , to constrain primordial non - gaussianity of the local type . </S>",
