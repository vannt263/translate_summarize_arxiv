    "irreversible systems in the stationary state are in a process of continuous production of entropy . in systems ,",
    "like the one studied here , governed by a master equation , that is , defined by a continuous time markov process , the irreversibility is characterized by the lack of detailed balance .",
    "when a system governed by a markov process is reversible , that is , when the dynamic rules are such that detailed balance is obeyed , the production of entropy vanishes at the equilibrium state .",
    "this is indeed the case of the glauber model and any other dynamics used to simulate the equilibrium ising model .",
    "the production of entropy is then a signature of irreversibility .    the rate of change of the entropy @xmath0 of a system can be properly decomposed into two contributions @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the entropy production due to irreversible processes occurring inside the system and @xmath3 is the entropy flux from the system to the environment .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is positive definite whereas @xmath3 can have either sign . in the stationary state",
    "the entropy @xmath0 of the system remains constant so that @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the quantity @xmath3 is defined here as the flux from inside to outside the system . so that , it will be positive in the stationary state .    in this work",
    "we study the steady state production of entropy in a nonequilibrium lattice model , namely , the majority - vote model @xcite .",
    "this is a polling model in which individuals in a community take the opinion of their neighbors with a certain probability @xmath5 and the opposite opinion with probability @xmath6 . in two or more dimensions , this model displays a continuous phase transition described by the same critical exponents as the equilibrium ising model @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the conjecture by grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite according to which nonequilibrium stochastic systems with up - down symmetry fall in the universality class of the equilibrium ising model .",
    "the flux of entropy is determined by means of an expression which is the average of a function of the rates of transition from one state to another and its reverse @xcite . as the entropy production equals the entropy flux in the stationary state , the former",
    "can be determined from the expression for the latter .",
    "we use mean - field and monte carlo simulations to calculate the entropy flux . in the stationary regime , and at the critical point , the entropy flux , or equivalently , the entropy production , displays a singularity which we assume to be the same singularity occurring in the entropy of the equilibrium ising model .",
    "let us consider a system described by a continuous markov process with stochastic variables defined over the sites of a regular lattice .",
    "a configuration of the system is denoted by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of sites of the lattice and @xmath9 is the spin variable associated to site @xmath10 .",
    "we will be concerned only with one spin flip dynamics , defined by a transition rate @xmath11 in which the spin variable @xmath12 changes its sign .",
    "the time evolution of the probability @xmath13 is governed by the master equation , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the gibbs entropy @xmath16 of the system at time @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 using the master equation ( [ 2 ] ) , its time derivative can be written as @xmath19 @xmath20 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , the righ - hand side of this expression should be decomposed into two terms , the entropy production @xmath2 and the entropy flux @xmath3 .",
    "these two quantities have the following expressions @xcite @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is always positive as can be easily proved , and the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) can be written as the average over the stationary probability distribution , that is , @xmath24    this is a particularly useful equation because it can be employed to estimate @xmath3 from a monte carlo simulation . as it is well known only quantities that can be written as averages can be determined numerically in a monte carlo simulation . in this sense",
    "it is not possible to determine @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) nor @xmath2 , given by eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , but it is actually possible to determine @xmath3 from eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "we remark finally that in the steady state @xmath25 so that it is possible to determine the entropy production in this regime by a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the majority - vote model is a one - spin flip stochastic dynamics defined by the following transition rate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a function that equals @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 according to whether @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 , and the summation is over the nearest neighbor sites of site @xmath10 .",
    "notice that the transition rate @xmath11 has the up - down symmetry , that is , it is invariant under the sign change of all spin variables @xmath12 . at each time interval ,",
    "a site @xmath10 is chosen at random .",
    "if the majority of the neighbors are in state @xmath34 then the site takes the value @xmath34 with probability @xmath5 and the opposite sign with probability @xmath6 where @xmath35 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath36",
    "so that @xmath37 . the model can also be interpreted as an ising system in contact with two heat reservoir at temperatures @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "putting it in a different way , one reservoir always provides energy and the other takes it away .",
    "spin systems in contact with two heat baths at different temperatures @xcite are perhaps the simplest models with nonequilibrium steady states exhibiting dynamic phase transitions .    in the stationary regime",
    ", the present model displays a continuous phase transition from an ordered ( ferromagnetic ) state to a disordered ( paramagnetic ) state . on a square lattice",
    "it is found by numerical simulation that the critical point occurs at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the ordered state occurs when @xmath41 and the disordered state when @xmath42 . for @xmath43",
    ", this model does not obey detailed balance and we expect a strictly positive entropy production . when @xmath44 the system is completely disordered and corresponds to a reversible system so that the entropy production vanishes in this case .",
    "the critical behavior @xcite puts this model in the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model .",
    "this result comes from the conjecture by grinstein et al .",
    "@xcite which states that models with stochastic evolution rules with up - down symmetry belongs to the ising universality class .    from the transition rate @xmath11 given by eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) it is straightforward to show that @xmath45 therefore , the entropy flux per site @xmath46 for the majority - vote model can be determined as the average @xmath47 notice that for a square lattice the function @xmath27 reads @xmath48",
    "from the master equation we get the following equations for the time evolution of the magnetization @xmath49 @xmath50    in the first order dynamic mean - field approximation , or simple mean - field approximation , the correlations are neglected and we need only this equation .",
    "we apply the approximation to the case of a regular lattice of coordination four . in the stationary state , the magnetization @xmath51 is given by the equation @xmath52 using this approximation , we derive the following expression for the entropy flux @xmath53    the paramagnetic solution , @xmath54 , gives the following expression for the entropy flux in the paramagnetic phase @xmath55 the ferromagnetic solution is given by the expression @xmath56 which is valid for @xmath57 . from this result",
    "it follows that the entropy flux in the ferromagnetic state is @xmath58 the stationary entropy flux , or equivalently the entropy production , is a continuous function of the parameter @xmath59 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . at the critical point",
    "it presents a singularity represented in this mean - field approximation by a discontinuity in the first derivative .",
    "we have simulated the majority - vote model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for different values of the size @xmath60 of the system .",
    "the simulation was performed as follows . at each time",
    "step a site is chosen at random .",
    "it takes the value of the majority sign of its neighbors with probability @xmath61 and the opposite sign with probability @xmath59 in accordance with the prescription given by eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) . after discarding the first monte carlo steps",
    "the stationary properties are calculated .",
    "we used from @xmath62 to @xmath63 monte carlo steps to calculate the averages such as the flux @xmath64 given by eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the magnetization and other quantities such as the susceptibility have already been determined by monte carlo simulations @xcite and will not concern us here .",
    "it is found that a continuous phase transition takes place at @xmath40 and that the critical exponents are the same as those of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the numerical results for the entropy flux @xmath64 for several values of the size of the system @xmath65 . the entropy flux is finite and continuous .",
    "it has a maximum and vanishes when @xmath66 and when @xmath67 as expected since in these two limits the system reaches an equilibrium stationary state . when @xmath66 we found numerically that the flux vanishes according to @xmath68 with @xmath69 and when @xmath67 , it vanishes according to @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "we remark that the critical point does not correspond to the maximum of @xmath64 .",
    "actually , it corresponds to the point of inflexion occurring just before the maximum as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 . at the critical point",
    "the flux is finite but has a singularity which we assume to be the same type as that of the energy or the entropy of the equilibrium ising model , namely , of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the value of the entropy flux at the critical point .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to the regimes below ( @xmath76 ) and above ( @xmath77 ) the critical point .",
    "the energy of the equilibrium ising model is related to the short range correlations of the even type . from eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) and the result given by eq .",
    "( [ 10a ] ) we see that the entropy flux is also related to the short range correlations of the even type : @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the critical behavior of the entropy flux of nonequilibrium models with up - down symmetry and the critical behavior of energy of the equilibrium ising model are described by the same critical exponent .    to determine the critical behavior it is convenient to study the derivative of the entropy flux with respect to the external parameter @xmath59 which , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) , behaves as @xmath82 the exponent @xmath83 is the same exponent related to the specific heat of the equilibrium ising model .",
    "since , for the square lattice , the singularity is of the logarithm ( @xmath84 ) type then we assume that for the present two - dimensional majority - vote model @xmath85    to test the assumption given by eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) we have numerically determined @xmath86 for several lattice sizes @xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "4 . using a finite - size scaling theory @xcite ,",
    "then this quantity as a function of @xmath65 should diverges as @xmath87 at the critical point and a similar behavior at the maximum , that is , @xmath88 from fig .",
    "5 we see that this behavior is indeed followed when @xmath89 .",
    "we have determined by mean - field approximation and by monte carlo simulations the stationary entropy production of a nonequilibrium model with up - down symmetry , namely , the majority - vote model .",
    "the calculation of this quantity by means of monte carlo simulations was possible because it equals the entropy flux , in the stationary state , and so this quantity can be written as an average over a stationary probability distribution .",
    "the mean - field analysis as well as the monte carlo simulations show that the stationary entropy production is positive for nonequilibrium situation , it vanishes when the system attains an equilibrium stationary state , and exhibits a singularity at the critical point .",
    "the mean - field results gives a singularity represented by a discontinuous first derivative as usually happens in mean - field calculations of the energy as a function of temperature in equilibrium spin models .",
    "the monte carlo data , analyzed by a finite - size scaling theory , have shown that the stationary entropy production has the same singular behavior at the critical point as the energy of the equilibrium ising model . in the present case , namely , the model defined on a square lattice , the singularity of the derivative of the entropy production is characterized by a logarithmic divergence .",
