    "the o - ps atom is the bound state of an electron and a positron with total spin @xmath0 = 1 . in vacuum o - ps",
    "has a relatively long lifetime of 142 ns because its annihilation via the fast two - gamma channel is prohibited by the conservation of the angular momemtum .",
    "annihilation through the two - gamma channel with an electron of the matter having an opposite spin is possible when o - ps interacts with matter .",
    "the resulting pick - off annihilation depends on the overlap of the o - ps with the electron density of the matter and it can reduce the positron lifetime remarkably  @xcite . in metals and semiconductors the electron density",
    "is enhanced around the positron due to the attractive electron - positron interaction .",
    "this means that a ps - like quasiparticle is created by the short - range screening of the positron by the electron cloud . in molecular matter and in some insulators such as sio@xmath1 ,",
    "the electron density is low in the interstitial regions and a ps atom can be formed  @xcite . in this case",
    "the electron accompanying the positron hinders efficiently further screening of the positron by electrons in the matter . on the other hand",
    ", there is a finite overlap between the positron and the electrons of the material manifesting itself as the repulsive pauli interaction and as the pick - off annihilation of o - ps .",
    "the pick - off annihilation lifetime spectroscopy of orto - positronium ( o - ps ) has a rather unique role as a method capable to study open volumes in soft or porous materials in which ps is formed .",
    "size and density distributions of nanometre - scale voids in polymers  @xcite , porous sio@xmath1 @xcite , and biostructures  @xcite have been estimated by measuring the pick - off annihilation rate of o - ps . however , in order to make a reliable quantitative analysis of the experimental results , one should be able to model o - ps states and annihilation in these structures with predictive power .",
    "in contrast to an atom where the nuclear degrees of freedom can , to a good approximation , be treated classically , both the electron and the positron in the ps atom are light quantum - mechanical particles and the non - adiabatic correlation effects have to be taken into account . for positrons in dense materials , such as metals and semiconductors , a good starting point is a separate calculation of the quantum - mechanical state of a single positron  @xcite . in practice , this calculation is based on the results of many - body theories for a delocalized positron in a homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the nature of the ps atom would call for a quantum - mechanical many - body calculation of the interacting electron - positron system in the coulomb field of nuclei . in the case of materials systems , this is clearly beyond the present computer capacity .",
    "an attractive starting point for modeling ps is to consider it as a distinguishable particle also when it is interacting closely with matter .",
    "this is in line with the view of a long - living o - ps interacting with matter and annihilating through a pick - off process .    the above - mentioned model of the ps atom interacting as a single particle with matter finds support also from experimental and theoretical studies of ps scattering off atoms and light molecules .",
    "recently , the scattering of ps off noble gas atoms and light molecules has been measured using a slow mono - energetic ps beam  @xcite .",
    "the scattering properties of ps have been seen to be dominated by the repulsive electron - electron pauli interaction at short distances . at long distances",
    "the van der waals attraction may play a role , especially in interactions with molecules of high polarizability .",
    "the positronium hydride ( hps ) bound state has been observed experimentally by schader et al .",
    "@xcite and its binding energy has been estimated to be around 1.1  ev ( 0.04  ha )",
    ". the bound states of ps with several small atoms have been studied theoretically using exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "the most carefully studied system is hps  @xcite , which has been found to form a bound state with a binding energy of 0.039 ha , in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "lips  @xcite and naps  @xcite systems have also been predicted to form bound states with binding energies of 0.0123 ha and 0.0084 ha , respectively .",
    "the calculations show that at large distances the positron overlaps with an extra electron forming a free ps - like cluster , while , when the positron density overlaps with that of the electrons inside the atom the ps - like character is lost . in the case of closed - shell noble gas atoms the strong electron - electron pauli repulsion dominates the atom - ps interaction and the formation of bound states",
    "is prevented .",
    "thus far , only a small number of different atoms have been considered in this kind of accurate calculations .",
    "however , it is already clear that the atoms able to trap ps have high electron affinities and open - shell electronic structures  @xcite .",
    "mitroy and ivanov have studied the scattering of o - ps off rare - gas atoms and alkali metal ions .",
    "@xcite they determined the scattering lengths for wave vectors up to 0.5  @xmath2 corresponding to the ps energy of @xmath31.7 ev . besides rare - gas atoms , also molecules have small electron affinities .",
    "they typically have homo - lumo gaps of up to 1 ha and their electrons are well localized in molecular orbitals . in polymers and biomolecular materials , the main cohesive interaction between the molecules is the van der waals interaction and their molecular orbitals are not greatly affected .",
    "individual molecules still show homo - lumo gaps and the repulsive pauli interaction between electrons in neighboring molecules plays a role . on the other hand ,",
    "the van der waals interaction between the molecules and ps can also be strong , especially for molecules of high polarizability .",
    "a model widely used to study ps in small pores and voids ( @xmath4 2 nm ) is that developed by tao and eldrup  @xcite .",
    "the semi - empirical model relates the ps lifetime and the pore / void radius .",
    "ps is considered as a single particle and the pore / void is modeled using a spherical , cubic or elliptic infinite potential well .",
    "the electron density of the material enters the void and forms a layer of the thickness @xmath5r on its surface .",
    "the pick - off annihilation rate is calculated from the overlap of the positron density with the electron density of the material .",
    "the parameter of the model , @xmath5r , is not well known for all the materials and its chemical dependence can not be described .",
    "in addition , the model assumes compact pores inside the material .",
    "the model has been extended to larger pores including the annihilation with excited particle - in - a - box states distributed according the boltzmann distribution at a finite temperature .",
    "@xcite    schmitz and mller - plathe  @xcite introduced an atomistic model to describe ps states and annihilation at voids in polymers .",
    "the potential landscape for ps is based on the superposition of interactions between the ps atom and individual atoms .",
    "these interactions , in turn , include the long - range van der waals interaction based on the polarizabilities of the ps atom and the atoms in the polymer and the short - range pauli repulsion between the electron in the ps atom and the electrons of the material .",
    "the latter interaction is described by fitting to experimental scattering cross sections .",
    "the ps wave function corresponding to a given finite temperature is solved for by the path integral monte - carlo method and thereafter the pick - off annihilation rate is calculated as the overlap of the positron density with the electron density which is also obtained as a superposition over the atoms .",
    "our final goal is the atomistic modeling of a ps atom interacting with molecular materials so that the necessary approximations made and the model parameters chosen are based on ab - initio results .",
    "studying theoretically the heps system will help to understand several aspects in the properties of ps also in molecular solids and liquids .",
    "this is because in molecules electrons are also in a closed shell configuration and a homo - lumo gap sets the minimum energy necessary for an extra electron ( of the ps atom ) to enter into the electron cloud of the molecule .    the similarities between molecules with homo - lumo gaps and closed - shell rare gas atoms in mind , we have calculated the many - body wavefunction and the total energy of the unbound heps system by the exact diagonalization technique using a explicitly correlated gaussians basis optimized by a stochastic variational method ( ecg - svm ) .",
    "in order to study the interaction of a ps and a he atom at finite distances , the mean distance of the positron from the nucleus has been constrained . as a result ,",
    "a set of configurations has been considered with the nucleus - positron mean distance ranging between 1.87  a@xmath6 and 91.90  a@xmath6 .",

    "svm can be also used to study unbound systems setting boundaries to the possible values of the non - linear parameters @xmath24 , i.  e. increasing the minimum value the particles can be prevented to separate to the infinity  @xcite .",
    "the configurations with the lowest energy are searched for within the available parameter space , i.e. , the energy is minimized within a constrained parameter space . in order to model the interaction between he and the ps atom at different distances",

    "<S> the many - body system comprising a he nucleus , three electrons , and a positron has been studied using the exact diagonalization technique . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose has been to clarify to which extent the system can be considered as a distinguishable positronium ( ps ) atom interacting with a he atom and , thereby , to pave the way to a practical atomistic modeling of ps states and annihilation in matter . the maximum value of the distance between the positron and the nucleus is constrained and the ps atom at different distances from the nucleus is identified from the electron and positron densities , as well as from the electron - positron distance and center - of - mass distributions . the polarization of the ps atom increases as its distance from the nucleus decreases . </S>",
    "<S> a depletion of the he electron density , particularly large at low density values , has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> the ortho - ps pick - off annihilation rate calculated as the overlap of the positron and the free he electron densities has to be corrected for the observed depletion , specially at large pores / voids . </S>"
