    "the physics of noninteracting electrons on lattices without any translational invariance has been the subject of intense theoretical activity since many years .",
    "beginning with the work of anderson @xcite describing the absence of diffusion in randomly disordered lattices , a wealth of knowledge has now accumulated in this field . over the last couple of decades the problem of electron localization in low dimensional quasicrystalline and fractal lattice models have enriched this field further @xcite-@xcite .",
    "regular fractal networks have already been appreciated to be linked to certain disordered structures , such as the percolation backbone clusters @xcite .",
    "such systems , by the way they are generated , are self similar and exhibit the absence of any long ranged translational order .",
    "yet , they are not random .",
    "this gives the fractal networks the status of being intermediate between perfectly periodic structures and completely disordered ones .",
    "naturally , they became the objects of detailed theoretical study over all these years .    a regular fractal lattice with finite ramification ( meaning that a large part can be detached by removing a finite number of bonds ) is generally solvable , and is found to possess exotic spectral features @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the properties are similar for electrons and other excitations such as phonons or magnons .",
    "for example , it is found @xcite that , contrary to the absolutely continuous electronic spectrum of a perfectly crystalline sample , or the pure point spectrum of a randomly disordered lattice , the electronic spectrum of a deterministic fractal is typically a cantor set of measure zero .",
    "the changing local environment around each lattice point leads to localization of the single particle eigenstates , but in a way not found common in conventional disordered samples .",
    "the conductance in such fractalline systems is also found to show up power - law scaling with the size of the system .",
    "the scaling exponent may be distributed in a multifractal way @xcite , as the system approaches its thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is now known , that even a deterministic fractal may support a countable infinity of extended eigenstates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this observation is interesting , as fractal usually does not exhibit any short ranged ` positional correlation ' between the lattice points , as in the cases of certain random or quasiperiodic lattice models , known to support extended single particle states @xcite-@xcite .",
    "no local clusters of sites can really be identified which lead to resonance causing an extendedness in the basic character of the eigenfunction .",
    "the delocalization of an infinite number of extended single particle states in a fractal can thus be attributed to the structure of the lattice as a whole .    in this communication",
    "we report a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) analysis of the spectral features of a @xmath0-simplex fractal @xcite in the presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "the growth of a @xmath0-simplex fractal is described in fig .",
    "1 . we choose the magnetic flux to penetrate the small triangular plaquettes at each generation , in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the fractal .",
    "this results in a break in the time reversal symmetry as the electron hops along the edges of a basic triangle .",
    "the hopping along the ` bond ' joining the two neighboring triangle remains unaffected by the field .",
    "the magnetic field is already known to have a non - trivial effect on the cantor set energy spectrum usually supported by such fractals as has been demonstrated in the case of a sierpinski gasket network @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the zero field solution is found to be broken , and the energy spectrum broadens up , though the isolated character of the eigenstates is preserved .",
    "later , wang @xcite re - examined the sierpinski gasket in the presence of a magnetic field using an rsrg method , but allowed only a subset of the full parameter space to evolve under rsrg transformations .",
    "the suppression of the evolution of the full parameter space , to our mind , sometimes may lead to incomplete information about the eigenstates .",
    "we take up the investigation of the spectral properties of a @xmath0-simplex lattice mainly motivated by the following ideas :    first , apart from being representatives of certain percolation clusters , deterministic fractal geometries have also been realized experimentally .",
    "modern nano - fabrication techniques have made it possible to experimentally investigate model systems , such as the josephson junction arrays and superconducting networks developed following a sierpinski gasket fractal @xcite where both the nature , and the amount of disorder can be accurately controlled .",
    "the level of frustration in such case can be tuned by an external magnetic field . additionally , recent experimental measurements of persistent current in an array of mesoscopic rings @xcite suggest that , one can think of a deterministic fractal network with multiple loops at all scales of length and observe the interplay of magnetic field and the fractal geometry in the transport and related issues in such networks .",
    "detailed study in this regard has received relatively little attention so far @xcite , and deserves more analysis .",
    "second , we wish to have a deeper look at whether the external magnetic field , if it generates extended eigenfunctions for the fractal , is linked to any cyclic invariance of the hamiltonian . if such cycles at all exist , it is important to understand whether they have any correlation with the values of the external flux responsible for them . in that case",
    "it would be possible to tune the flux , which is an external _ agent _ to control the transport in finite fractal networks , as well as a classification between different extended states could be achieved .",
    "this aspect which has remained , to the best of our knowledge , really un - explored so far , is a major focus of the present work .",
    "we find several interesting features . in the absence of any field , and with the introduction of anisotropy in the amplitude of electron hopping ,",
    "the corner - to - corner transmission of a @xmath0-simplex fractal turns out to be better than its isotropic counterpart .",
    "clusters of high transmittivity pack the transmission spectrum in the former case , whereas , the system turns out to be poorly transmitting in the isotropic situation .",
    "this remains the general feature for both the isotropic and the anisotropic cases when a magnetic field is turned on , with the transmission coefficient exhibiting interesting aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations .",
    "the magnetic field is also found to have a dramatic effect on the local density of states at a corner site of an infinite ( or , semi - infinite ) @xmath0-simplex fractal .",
    "an ` apparently ' continuous distribution of eigenvalues appear around the centre of the spectrum , suggesting the formation of a ` band ' of extended states .",
    "we have not been able to prove conclusively the existence of a ` band ' of extended states",
    ". however , extensive numerical investigation of the local density of states and the behavior of the nearest neighbor hopping integrals under renormalization group iterations are suggestive of the fact .",
    "finally , we have particularly focused on a specific value of the energy of the electron which supports an extended eigenstate only in the presence of a magnetic flux , and have carried out careful numerical investigations on the flow of the parameters of the hamiltonian under repeated renormalization of the system , as the flux is changed systematically .",
    "we find that , for this specific extended eigenstate , values of the magnetic flux show up a strong correlation with the fixed point cycles of the parameter space , that can be predicted successfully .",
    "such observations may provide an idea of classifying the extended states in regards of the fixed points of the hamiltonian brought about by the external magnetic field .",
    "in what follows , we report our results . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and the rsrg scheme .",
    "section iii contains a discussion on the nature of the energy spectrum both in the absence and the presence of a field .",
    "section iv is devoted to the investigation of magneto - transport , while in section v we discuss how the flux values can be correlated to the cycles of the fixed point . in section",
    "vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "we begin by referring to fig .",
    "1 . the three basic triangular plaquettes ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) are placed as shown in the figure to generate a second - generation fractal ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . the process continues .",
    "a magnetic field penetrates each small triangle .",
    "we work within a tight binding formalism in which the hamiltonian for the electron in a basic triangular plaquette is written as , @xmath1 in the above , @xmath2 is the on - site potential which , in the most general anisotropic model , can assume two values , @xmath3 ( at the corner sites at the horizontal base of each elementary triangle ) and @xmath4 at the remaining vertices . the nearest neighbor hopping integrals @xmath5 are assigned amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 for hopping across the horizontal and the angular bonds within each elementary triangle respectively .",
    "the inter - triangle connection is given by @xmath8 in the horizontal direction , and @xmath9 otherwise , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) , and these are free from any associated flux .",
    "it is to be appreciated that the status of a vertex ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) is governed only by the bonds @xmath6 or @xmath7 attached to it . @xmath12 and @xmath13 remain un - decimated on renormalization , and does not play a part in fixing the status of a vertex .",
    "it may also be noted at this point that , this @xmath0-simplex network differs , in the presence of a magnetic field penetrating its elementary plaquettes , from its closest look - alike the sierpinski gasket @xcite in the fact that in the @xmath0-simplex network , the time reversal symmetry of the electron hopping is broken only partially , i.e. , when the electron hops along the edges of an elementary triangle , compared to a sierpinski gasket , where it is broken uniformly .",
    "it will be interesting to see the consequence of this at various scales of length .",
    "the magnetic flux threading each small triangle enters the hamiltonian only through the hopping integrals along the sides of the elementary triangles @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is the flux threading each small triangle , and @xmath16 is the flux quantum .",
    "following banavar , kadanoff and pruisken @xcite , we select the gauge in such a way that the a factor of @xmath17 is associated with either @xmath6 or @xmath7 when the electron hops in the direction given by the arrow .",
    "the phase is opposite when it hops back .",
    "thus , the ` forward ' or the ` backward ' hopping integrals in the presence of the field will be written as , @xmath18 .",
    "the model , as it is presented , allows one to study a perfectly general anisotropic case ( @xmath19 ) , including a hierarchical distribution of the bonds @xmath12 or @xmath13 , which is known to exhibit a very interesting ` restoration of isotropy ' in a @xmath0-simplex network of classical resistors @xcite , although , we do not pursue this topic here . the isotropic limit is easily retrieved as well .",

    "( b ) the lattice in its second generation .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the leads attached for transmission studies . ]",
    "the sites marked with decorated circles are now decimated to yield the following recursion relations for the on - site potentials and the hopping integrals .",

    "@xmath55 at any stage @xmath21 , @xmath56 representing @xmath26 or @xmath25 .",
    "the set of recursion relations given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) is a highly non - linear one , and can be reduced to a simple form only under simple isotropic model in the absence of any field .",
    "however , they are not so difficult to deal with numerically , and yield quite a few interesting results which we shall now discuss .",
    "to begin with , we have evaluated the local density of states ( ldos ) at a corner site of a @xmath0-simplex gasket in the isotropic limit , and in the absence of any magnetic field .",
    "we set @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and , @xmath59 .",
    "the recursion relations given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) now get reduced to , @xmath60 with , @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and , @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath21 again stands for the stage of renormalization . in the absence of any field",
    ", it is a simple task to evaluate the ldos at a corner site using the standard green s function technique @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the recursion relations produce the correct ldos at the corner site of a one dimensional chain @xcite in the limit @xmath65 . with a small imaginary part added to the energy @xmath66 ,",
    "the hopping integral @xmath67 flows to zero after certain steps of rsrg .",
    "this implies that the lattice , at that scale of length , breaks up into an assembly of diatomic molecules , with the hopping @xmath68 connecting the ` atoms ' remaining unchanged .",
    "each such molecule will be decoupled from its neighbors , and the transmission across the lattice will be zero .",
    "the on - site potential at the corner site reaches its fixed point value @xmath69 , and , the ldos ( meaningful only at an extreme corner site , which is truly decoupled from the rest of the lattice ) is then evaluated as , @xmath70 where , the diagonal green s function @xmath71 .",
    "a plot of the ldos at a corner site is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( top figure ) .",
    "the ldos is exhibited is checked , as permitted by the limit of accuracy , to be stable against a decreasing value of the imaginary part of the energy @xmath66 , and has been displayed within a value unity to give prominence to the smaller peaks compared to the much bigger ones .",
    "the fragmented , scanty appearance is consistent with the usual cantor set spectrum common to such systems .    before introducing the magnetic field ,",
    "it is pertinent to comment on the existence of extended eigenstates in this simplified model . if the recursion relations eq .",
    "( 8) are iterated for any arbitrary energy with no imaginary part added to it , the hopping integral @xmath67 flows to zero after certain steps of rsrg .",
    "this means that the corresponding energy should lie in a gap of the spectrum of the infinite system , or , corresponds to an exponentially localized eigenstate , though it is not possible to distinguish between these two cases by simply looking at the flow of the hopping integral .",
    "it should be remembered that a zero ldos is not a conclusive proof for an energy not to be in the spectrum of the infinite lattice . on the other hand , if , for certain energy , the hopping integral remains non - zero under an indefinite number of iterations , then we have definitely hit upon an extended eigenstate .",
    "it is not difficult , using eq.s ( 8) to fix an energy for which @xmath72 .",
    "the energy , evaluated in this fashion can then be inserted into the second equation in ( 8) , and one can select @xmath73 in such a manner that @xmath74 under rsrg remains equal to @xmath67 . as the inter - triangle hopping is always @xmath73 , we thus have a fixed point of the parameter space , viz , @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding state will be extended in nature .",
    "this of course demands a definite relationship between @xmath77 , @xmath67 and @xmath73 , that is , we are talking of a specific model .",
    "for example , with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , if we set @xmath80 , then the fixed point behavior sets in from the first rsrg step onwards if @xmath73 is assigned a value equal to @xmath81 ( in units of @xmath67 ) .",
    "much more involved relationship between the parameters of the system is capable of leading to a fixed point behavior starting at deeper scales of renormalization .",
    "however , in each case , a different set of parameters essentially means that we are dealing with a different system . in principle",
    ", we will observe extended eigenstates in each of those cases which provide a meaningful relationship between the parameters , but only at certain discrete energy values . .25 in      a magnetic field , however , is capable of bringing dramatic changes into the spectrum even when we deal with a particular system with a pre - defined set of parameters . in the lower one in fig .",
    "2 the ldos at the corner site is shown for a flux @xmath82 for the simplest isotropic model with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the spectrum shows very closely spaced zones of finite density of states .",
    "of particular interest is the narrow energy interval around the ` centre ' @xmath85 , where , the appearance of a smooth region of almost constant density of states exits .",
    "it has not been possible to prove the existence of a continuous _ band _ of states , though we have made very fine scan around @xmath85 , each time reducing the energy interval to be scanned and diminishing the imaginary part to be added to the energy @xmath66 .",
    "the ldos is found to be stable under a variation in the imaginary part @xmath86 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( in unit of @xmath67 ) , and within the limits of machine accuracy , it is tempting to conjecture the existence of a continuous zone of eigenstates around @xmath85 .",
    "the occurrence of dense clusters of non - zero density of states has been tested with other values of the magnetic field .",
    "the general conclusion is the same ( except for @xmath89 , @xmath90 being an integer ) , and the qualitative features do not essentially change even when we deal with the anisotropic gasket .",
    "to calculate the quantum mechanical transmission across a finite @xmath0-simplex network of any size , we adopt the very well known formalism proposed by douglas stone et al .",
    "@xcite , and consequently used by others as well @xcite .",
    "the essential method consists in placing the desired fractal network between perfectly ordered semi - infinite leads ( shown by dashed lines in fig.1(b ) ) connected to the two extreme @xmath10-sites at the base .",
    "the leads may be described by a uniform on - site potential @xmath91 , and constant nearest neighbor hopping integral @xmath92 . a network at the @xmath21th generation is then renormalized @xmath93 times to reduce it to a simple triangle , and finally to a diatomic ` molecule ' @xcite , still clamped between the leads , with an effective on - site potential @xmath94 , and an effective hopping integral @xmath95 .",
    "the transmission coefficient is then easily obtained in terms of the quantities @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the electron energy @xmath66 .",
    "the method is so well known that we skip the detailed mathematical expressions to save space , and present the results only .",
    "let us start with the isotropic case , that is , @xmath96 , and , @xmath97 .",
    "consider no flux , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "the transmission spectrum consists of the expected isolated peaks , consistent with the ldos spectrum . with increasing size",
    "the fractal turns out to be even poorly transmitting .",
    "interesting changes however start showing up with the introduction of anisotropy .",
    "quite arbitrarily , we set , @xmath99 and start reducing the values of @xmath100 from one towards zero ( the limit when the fractal reduces to a linear chain clamped between the leads ) .",
    "the on - site potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 are chosen to be equal , and have been set equal to zero . with the introduction of anisotropy , regions of finite transmission increase in number .",
    "for example , putting @xmath101 ( that is , a small departure from isotropy ) , the spectrum is still very much like the isotropic situation , with new clusters of appreciable transmittance ( sometimes unity as well ) appearing in many places . with gradual decrease in the values of the @xmath25-hopping",
    ", the newly generated small spiky zones increase in number , join ` hand in hand ' and the shape of the entire spectrum start drifting towards what it should be in the case of a periodic chain clamped between the leads .",
    "the spectrum tends to be restricted within @xmath102 , which is the allowed band of the ordered lead , and resembles the spectrum of a @xmath103-d chain , as @xmath104 becomes vanishingly small . in fig .",
    "3 we show the transmission spectrum of a @xmath105-th generation @xmath0-simplex structure , both for the isotropic situation ( top ) , and the anisotropic cases ( the middle and bottom ones ) in support of the above remarks .      we have investigated the general features of the transmission coefficient as the flux through each elementary plaquette",
    "is varied .",
    "the features are of course sensitive to the energy of the electron that enters the system through the lead . for calculation ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath83 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the lead parameters in this case are chosen to be @xmath107 , and @xmath108 to encompass the full spectrum of the fractal network . in the case of an isotropic @xmath0-simplex network , the magnetic field",
    "is found to generate clusters of resonant transmission throughout the spectrum , a particularly noticeable broadening taking place at and around @xmath85 .    in fig .",
    "4 we display the transmission spectrum of a sixth generation fractal with energy @xmath66 with a flux @xmath109 threading each elementary triangle .",
    "the spectrum is notable for a thick population of high transmission values at and around @xmath85 .",
    "several other _",
    "mini bands _ of resonant transmission also mark the spectrum .",
    "this feature is in sharp contrast to that in the absence of any field ( fig .",
    "3 , the top figure for example ) .",
    "we have observed the change in the width of the cluster of high transmission zone around @xmath85 by carefully scanning the energy interval .",
    "it is seen that the width of the transmission window around @xmath85 , for any generation , changes continuously with the introduction of the flux , from zero at @xmath98 to a maximum at @xmath110 , and then shrinks back to zero again at @xmath111 .",
    "the change in width of this central transmitting window shows a periodic variation with flux .",
    "the period is equal to a half flux quantum .",
    "similar observations as above are made with anisotropy in the hopping integrals , but with no real new qualitative features .",
    "the portion of the @xmath73 - @xmath112 graph immediately around @xmath85 remains densely packed with increasing size of the network .",
    "the second half of the study of transmission spectrum consists of an examination of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations in the transmission coefficient at a fixed energy of the electron .",
    "we have displayed results for @xmath85 .",
    "the period of oscillations is found to be equal to one flux quantum .",
    "the detailed features of the spectrum are of course sensitive to the chosen energy of the electron . in fig .",
    "5 we show the ab oscillations within one period for a third and a sixth generation gasket . once again , the transmission window between zero and one - half flux quantum shows multiple resonance peaks in the sixth generation fractal compared to a fairly broad and structureless shape observed in the third generation .",
    "interestingly , with increasing generation , the spectrum is enriched by the appearance of multiple peaks with transmission equal to one ( or , very close to one ) , but , the transmittivity really does nt fall to zero for any appreciable value of the flux between @xmath113 , and , @xmath114 .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectral features on the parameters of the system are easily revealed when we look at the variation of the transmission coefficient against changing magnetic flux in the case of an anisotropic simplex lattice . while the electron with @xmath85 does nt distinguish between an isotropic and an anisotropic fractal , other energy values",
    "may lead to gross changes in the fine structure of the spectrum .",
    "we point out an interesting phenomenon .",
    "it is possible to fix up the electron energy in such a way , that , with large anisotropy ( that is , for low enough values of @xmath104 ) , the amplitudes of the ab oscillations start decreasing as the transmission coefficient assumes values very close to one . at one stage ,",
    "the transmittance @xmath73 becomes practically indistinguishable from unity , as @xmath104 is brought below certain value . by magnifying the scale of observation ,",
    "it is still possible to see how the system tries to preserve the ab oscillations , which soon smoothes out if the @xmath115-hopping is diminished further . in such cases , with increasing generation , the hopping integral @xmath116 flows to zero , while @xmath117 does not .",
    "it means , as the system grows in size , the intricate geometry of the fractal starts ` disappearing ' to the incoming electron .",
    "it essentially feels an ordered chain , and if the energy chosen happens to lie in the allowed band of that ordered chain , we get a ballistic transport . in fig .",
    "6 we display one such example where , @xmath118 in unit of @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of extended eigenstates in systems without any translational order has always been an intriguing feature in the study of disordered systems .",
    "however , the complex forms of the recursion relations make an analytical attempt rather difficult for a @xmath0-simplex network .",
    "we have therefore relied on a careful numerical study .",
    "we specially observe the flow of the hopping integrals under successive rsrg steps .",
    "the non - zero values of the hopping integrals under rsrg stand out to be a definite signature of the state being extended .",
    "in all the discussion that follows , we confine ourselves to the isotropic case only .",
    "it is now evident that , the magnetic field generates a dense set of eigenvalues , almost resembling a continuum , around @xmath85 .",
    "quite arbitrarily we have selected a portion @xmath119 , in unit of @xmath6 in a model with @xmath83 , @xmath106 , and have chosen the value of the magnetic flux @xmath82 .",
    "the ldos in this portion is found to be very stable as the imaginary part added to the energy is decreased from @xmath87 to @xmath120 .",
    "a fine scan over the points in this interval reveals that , any energy we hit upon quite randomly in this range , corresponds to a non - zero value of the nearest neighbor hopping integral under successive renormalization .",
    "this indicates the presence of extended eigenstates .",
    "of course , this is not a conclusive proof of the existence of a _ band _ of extended states , but , the smaller and smaller widths of the energy interval chosen , remaining close to @xmath85 , lead to similar behavior .",
    "this is suggestive of the fact that the presence of a band of extended eigenstates may not be a remote possibility in this case .",
    "we have carried out the numerical investigation for other values of the flux and other energy intervals , and in many occasions similar observation has been made .",
    "the observations are in accord with the transmission spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "let us now turn to a different aspect of the problem .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the isotropic model with @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the phase associated with the hopping , at any @xmath21th stage of rsrg will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "we draw the attention of the reader to fig .",
    "7 which presents the transmission as a function of the applied flux for a seventh generation @xmath0-simplex fractal ( solid line ) , together with the ldos ( dashed line ) at @xmath85 , plotted by varying the flux from zero to a single flux quantum .",
    "it is interesting to see how the energy @xmath85 is periodically brought in and out of the spectrum of the infinite system by the magnetic field , the period being equal to @xmath123 .",
    "once again , we have tested the robustness of the ldos spectrum by diminishing the imaginary part added to energy from bigger @xmath124 to much smaller @xmath125 values , so that it is not unjustified to conclude that we definitely have a state at @xmath85 .",
    "the spectrum also gives us an indication that we have a continuous ldos as flux changes from zero to half flux quantum .",
    "we fix our energy of interest at @xmath85 .",
    "looking at the evolution of the hopping integral under successive rsrg steps as we gradually increase the flux threading an elementary triangular plaquette from zero to @xmath123 and beyond , we make two interesting observations .",
    "first , for @xmath113 , and , @xmath114 , the hopping integrals do not flow to zero under iteration , bringing out the fact that @xmath85 corresponds to a perfectly extended eigenstate for what appears to be a continuous distribution of flux values .",
    "second , different flux values chosen for the above observation unravel the existence of fixed points with multiple cycles .",
    "most interestingly , we have found that the values of the magnetic flux leading to these cyclic fixed points group into a definite pattern , the formation of which can be predicted from the results of our numerical scan of the range of the flux values . the same pattern ( of the number of cycles )",
    "is repeated as we change the flux at certain specially chosen equal intervals along the flux line from @xmath98 to @xmath126 .",
    "we clarify the meaning of the above statements below by citing specific results .",
    "let us consider the interval @xmath98 to @xmath126 , and divide this interval into @xmath127 subintervals with @xmath90 being a positive integer , and @xmath128 .",
    "if we exclude the two extreme points at @xmath98 and @xmath126 on this ` flux line ' , then the remaining values of the magnetic flux making this division are distributed at the locations ( coordinates ) @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "let us pick up the simplest choice , viz , @xmath131 .",
    "the interval @xmath113 is then split into four equal sub - intervals .",
    "the values of the flux inside the line ( that is , excluding the values at the boundary ) are located at @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , sequentially from the left .",
    "we set @xmath135 .",
    "it is immediately observed that , the entire parameter space defined by the trio @xmath136 gets locked into a @xmath137-cycle fixed point beginning at @xmath138 , where @xmath21 represents the rsrg step .",
    "that is , we have for @xmath139 , @xmath140 with @xmath141 , we again get a @xmath137-cycle fixed point of the parameter space @xmath136 . but",
    "now , the fixed point behavior is observed for @xmath142 . setting the external flux equal to the remaining value in this interval , viz , @xmath143",
    ", we get a @xmath103-cycle fixed point of the same parameter space beginning at @xmath144 , that is , at the first stage of rsrg onwards .",
    "it should be appreciated that , the values of the flux @xmath139 and @xmath82 can be termed ` equivalent ' only in the _ number of cycles of the fixed point _ they generate .",
    "the extended wavefunctions they represent , are characteristically different as the invariant cycles of the parameter space set in at different stages of renormalization .",
    "we now increase the value of @xmath90 in steps .",
    "the behavior of the parameter space defined by @xmath136 is observed under successive rsrg iteration as the magnetic flux is made to assume sequential values given by @xmath145 from the left .",
    "our ` experiment ' leads to the following very interesting observations :    \\(i ) if we denote the flux leading to an @xmath21-cycle fixed point by @xmath146 $ ] , then the values of the flux between zero and the half flux quantum group themselves into a series of _ triplets _ , viz , @xmath147 , \\phi[2 ] , \\phi[1])$ ] .",
    "\\(ii ) this triplet repeats itself periodically as we sweep through the points @xmath148 along the flux axis between zero and half flux quantum . for",
    "any given value of @xmath90 which fixes the number of intervals , the cyclic invariance of the full parameter space will start showing up at a specific step of renormalization .",
    "this ` step ' @xmath21 is given by the ` power ' @xmath90 of @xmath137 in the denominator in the expression for the flux @xmath15 , whenever @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "thus , for an eight sub - interval splitting of the range @xmath151 , the first value ( after zero ) at @xmath152 exhibits a @xmath137-cycle fixed point starting at @xmath153 .",
    "the second flux @xmath154 leads to a @xmath137-cycle fixed point beginning at @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath155 we have a @xmath103-cycle fixed point for @xmath156 .",
    "this sequence of cycles repeats periodically , but the stage at which the invariance starts showing up is not the same for every flux",
    ". however , for values of @xmath157 , a subset of the fixed points ( @xmath103-cycle , or @xmath137-cycle ) are truly equivalent in the sense that they start showing up at the same stage of rsrg . in this sense ,",
    "the fixed points arising out of flux values @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 are truly equivalent .",
    "it should be appreciated that the sequence of flux values responsible for a certain cyclic behavior has a deterministic feature .",
    "if we select @xmath161 , with @xmath131 , @xmath0 , @xmath162,@xmath163 sequentially , then its easy to check that for all such values of @xmath15 we have a @xmath137-cycle fixed point beginning at @xmath164 .",
    "thus , at the left - most value of the flux , the cyclic invariance starts revealing at the deepest scale of length .",
    "as we move along the flux line , the fixed point character begins to show up earlier , and at @xmath165 , we see it immediately from @xmath166 onwards . similarly , whenever @xmath167 , with @xmath168 , @xmath137 , @xmath0,@xmath163 , and @xmath128 , we come across a @xmath103-cycle fixed point for @xmath169 . for example , by selecting @xmath170 , the values of the flux at @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 exhibit @xmath103-cycle fixed point beginning at @xmath176 , @xmath162 , @xmath177 , @xmath0 and @xmath177 respectively .",
    "similar deterministic feature has also been possible to locate for other sub - divisions .",
    "it is obvious that the separation between the one cycle , and the two - cycle values of the flux becomes exponentially smaller as we split the flux interval between zero and one - half flux quantum more and more by increasing @xmath90 .",
    "the behavior of ( @xmath178 , \\phi[2 ] , \\phi[1])$ ] is consistent with our expectation , so far as we have tested .",
    "this encourages us to conclude that , speaking just in terms of the one and two - cycle fixed points , there will be a ` quasi - continuous ' cross - over in the character of the extended eigenstates as one sweeps over the specific flux values at @xmath129 along the flux line between zero and half flux quantum .",
    "_ what happens in the range @xmath179 ?",
    "_    similar correlations between the flux values and the cycles of the fixed points may also be looked for the flux ranging from @xmath126 to one flux quantum .",
    "the pattern however , may be different .",
    "for example , if we split the full range of flux , from @xmath98 to @xmath180 , in @xmath181 equal intervals , then it is seen that from @xmath182 , with @xmath183 , the pattern @xmath147 , \\phi[2 ] , \\phi[1])$ ] is periodically repeated .",
    "the mid - point @xmath180 has to be omitted as we do not get any state there . in the rest of the flux interval ,",
    "that is , from @xmath184 and upto @xmath185 in interval of @xmath186 , we now get a triplet @xmath147 , \\phi[1 ] , \\phi[2])$ ] repeating periodically",
    ". one can proceed in this way for other values of @xmath90 .",
    "for any given @xmath90 , the entire pattern observed between @xmath98 and @xmath180 obviously repeats beyond one flux quantum .",
    "we have tested these observations , by working out the patterns for a few values of @xmath90 to begin with , and then speculated the pattern for larger values of @xmath90 .",
    "this test has been successful and gives us confidence to predict the correlation as it has been described above .",
    "before we end this section , it is good to note that , we have chosen to speak in terms of the one and the two cycle fixed points only .",
    "there are , other flux values as well for which one gets different multiple cyclic behavior , even a completely chaotic behavior of the parameter space .",
    "all these point towards the existence of extended eigenstates in a @xmath0-simplex network .",
    "however , we have tried to focus on a definite correlation between cycles of invariance of the parameter space , and a given set of values of the magnetic flux by citing the above example .",
    "we have examined the spectral properties of a @xmath0-simplex fractal network in the presence of a magnetic field penetrating a subspace of this fractal space .",
    "both the isotropic and the anisotropic limits of the model have been discussed with special emphasis on the flux dependent electronic transmission and the existence of extended electronic states .",
    "based on a numerical study of the exact renormalization group recursion relations we show that there is a subtle correlation between the value of the magnetic flux and the fixed point behavior of the hamiltonian , and propose that such an observation may lead to a method of classification of the extended eigenstates for a given value of the energy of the electron .",
