    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are produced when a pulsar s relativistic wind interacts with the surrounding medium .",
    "they produce emission across a broad spectral range from radio synchrotron emission to @xmath1-rays [ @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "a subset of pwne has been identified in which pulsars with high spatial velocities produce bow - shock structures and cometary shapes [ e.g. , b1957 + 20 @xcite ; j0437 - 4715 @xcite ; rxj1856.5 - 3754 @xcite ; b0740 - 28 @xcite ; j2124 - 3358 @xcite ; j1747 - 2958 ( the `` mouse '' nebula ) @xcite ] . such bow - shocks are detectable in collisionally excited h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "a theoretical model of balmer - dominated pulsar bow - shocks was developed by @xcite .",
    "a pulsar s high - spatial velocity is caused by the natal kick of the neutron star during its supernova explosion .",
    "numerous models have been proposed to take into account the deviation from spherical symmetry at the core of the progenitor star .",
    "this deviation can occur because of anisotropic neutrino emission during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling of the nascent remnant @xcite , anisotropic mass ejection during the sn explosion due to standing - accretion shock instability @xcite , or convective shell - burning during the final life cycle stage of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out special relativistic , hydrodynamics simulation of pulsar wind bow - shock nebulae , showing that the relativistic backflow from the fast - moving pulsar thermalizes in the form of a slowly inflating , trailing spherical bubble .",
    "this energy - driven bubble model also applies to bow - shock nebulae driven by jets from low - mass x - ray binaries moving through the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "this model describes the evolution of bow - shock pwne during the earliest stage , when the pulsar s location is close to its birth - place .",
    "the formation of the bow - shock / bubble morphology of bow - shock nebulae is illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ fig : evol ] and can be understood as follows : when a pulsar wind turns on , it inflates an energy - driven bubble , following the well - known solution by @xcite , the continuously fed analog to the sedov - taylor solution . from simple dimensional arguments it is easy to see that the radius of such a bubble is described by the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a spin - down loss energy rate , and @xmath4 is an ambient density .",
    "the expansion velocity of a wind - driven bubble decreases with time as @xmath5 .",
    "initially , the expansion velocity of this bubble must therefore be faster than the kick velocity of the pulsar",
    ". however , the velocity will eventually drop below the pulsar s velocity , and the pulsar will break out of the bubble .",
    "once this is the case , the pulsar wind will form a classical bow - shock nebula , where , on the up - wind side , the ram pressure of the ism balances the wind pressure .",
    "( upper case ) , and @xmath6 ( lower case ) . for both cases ,",
    "the pulsar is still inside the bubble in left - most plot , breaks out of the bubble in middle plot , and interacts with the ism producing bow - shock in right most plot.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   ( upper case ) , and @xmath6 ( lower case ) . for both cases ,",
    "the pulsar is still inside the bubble in left - most plot , breaks out of the bubble in middle plot , and interacts with the ism producing bow - shock in right most plot.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as described in @xcite and @xcite , the bow - shock will have a roughly conical shape behind the pulsar and matter will be accelerated from the high - pressure bow - shock back in the direction of the bubble . the bubble will therefore continue to be inflated while the pulsar moves away from its center .    for young pulsars",
    ", one might therefore expect the presence of such a neck / bubble structure in h - alpha images .",
    "however , as we will argue , the presence of bubbles behind the pulsar in later stages of pulsar evolution can not be explained by a model in which the bubble is inflated by the initial plerion after the pulsar turned on , given the large distances older pulsars will have traveled through the galaxy since turning on .",
    "these bubbles or cavities are not rare [ e.g. psr j2030 + 4415 , psr j1509 + 5850 @xcite , psr b2224 + 65 @xcite ] .",
    "observations of bubble- and shell - like structures behind bow - shock pwne in older pulsars must therefore be explained by a different mechanism .",
    "the guitar nebula is one of the most spectacular pwne , produced by one of the fastest known pulsars , psr b2224 + 65 , which has a transverse velocity of @xmath7 . in h@xmath0 observations , the nebula has a guitar - like shape with a bright head , trailing neck , and a series of roughly circular shells / bubbles @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : guitarha ] .    the pulsar most probably originated from the cygnus ob3 association about 0.8 myr ago @xcite ,",
    "thus the observed bubbles behind it are clearly _ not _ generated from the pulsar s birth .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bubble2 ] ) , a rapid change in @xmath8 can be brought about by two things :    * a significant , instantaneous increase in the pulsar wind power will generate a new spherical bubble at the location where the wind power increased .",
    "* a sharp decrease in the ism density @xmath9 will also lead to the inflation of a new bubble .",
    "time - variable @xmath3 fails to account for the brightening in the constricted region of the guitar nebula , and the amount of the variability in @xmath3 is likely negligible compared to large morphological changes of the nebula @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that variation of the ambient density is likely responsible for the curious morphology of the guitar nebula . as an another possible mechanism , @xcite suggested that mass - loading of encountered neutral hydrogen makes bow - shock unstable likely altering the shock structures and producing the bubbles .",
    "the well - documented multi - phase nature of the ism supports the notion that bow - shock pulsars will sample a range of densities along their trajectories .",
    "for example , small - scale density variations corresponding to tens of au are observed in the galactic hi absorption @xcite .",
    "@xcite also detect interstellar medium column density variations on scales of @xmath10 au , inferred from expansion rates of a type ia supernova photospheres .",
    "the question is : can the morphological details of the guitar nebula be explained by a reasonable density structure of the ism the pulsar is traversing ?",
    "the primary goal of this study is therefore to investigate the dynamic evolution of bow - shock pwne in inhomogeneous environments .",
    "@xcite reported that the spin - down ages of @xmath11 and kinematic ages @xmath12 of a sample of pulsars are within the range @xmath13 . under the reasonable assumption that pulsars are born somewhere within @xmath14 of the galactic mid - plane , they are expected to intersect the galactic plane at least once in the time travel .",
    "it is quite possible that fast - moving pulsars encounter significant changes in their environment .    in this work , using hydrodynamic simulations , we test whether a bubble forms when a pulsar undergoes a sharp change in the ambient density , and examine the temporal evolution of the bubble and the bow - shock after such a change .",
    "we also develop an analytic formula for the bow - shock to discuss the morphological variations of the structure of the shock in response to density changes in order to provide observational diagnostics for observations of bow - shock pwne .",
    "we apply this model to the guitar nebula , suggesting possible dynamical evolutionary paths .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the numerical method and the initial setup . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the evolution of the pwne encountering density discontinuities . in section 4",
    ", we compare our numerical results with h@xmath0 observations of the guitar nebula .",
    "we also discuss the effects of an inclined density transition layer to explain the asymmetric bow - shock in psr j2124 - 3358 . in section 5 , we summarize our results .",
    "simulations were carried out with the flash 3.3 hydrodynamic code @xcite , which is a modular and parallel simulation code suitable for solving compressible flow problems . an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) algorithm in the code",
    "enables us to investigate the global evolution of pwne efficiently using moderate computing resources .",
    "the refinement level of the simulations is determined by both the grid position and physical quantity : we set the finest resolution at the pulsar to safely resolve the pulsar wind and the bow - shock structure , which is _ _ lrefine_max__=11 implying that the highest resolution is @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt the piecewise - parabolic solver for our non - relativistic hydro runs @xcite .",
    "we use a multi - gamma equation of state , where the adiabatic index of the ambient medium is @xmath16 and that of the pulsar wind is @xmath17 .",
    "we verified that the ( non - relativistic ) bow - shock and bubble are well described by our non - relativistic simulations , even though the pulsar wind itself is relativistic , by performing a test study with fully relativistic simulations .",
    "the bulk of a pulsar s spin - down loss energy is converted into a relativistic pulsar wind @xcite . in general , the wind is likely anisotropic , and the anisotropy of the wind momentum flux should be taken into account to explain detailed bow - shock structures @xcite .",
    "however , the global features produced by interactions between pulsar winds and the surrounding medium are less influenced by the anisotropy of the wind .",
    "moreover , there is no evidence for an anisotropic or clumped pulsar wind in the series of h@xmath0 observations of the guitar nebula @xcite .",
    "therefore , we approximate the pulsar wind as a spherical inflow , injecting flux isotropically through a spherical surface at the pulsar s location for numerical simplicity ( see section 4 ) .",
    "a pulsar wind is ultra - relativistic , interacting with the ambient medium of either the supernova remnant ( snr ) or the ism , and the lorentz factor is in the range of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the pulsar wind produces an expanding bubble of relativistic particles around the neutron star . in principle , to model the _ internal _ structure and properties of the wind , relativistic and/or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations are necessary . for instance , @xcite studied the evolution of pwne by using relativistic mhd simulations , and reproduced the polar jet from the pulsar by magnetic hoop stress , which is observed in the x - ray images of crab nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the effect of wind magnetization on the evolution of shock layers in bow - shock pwne , and constraint the flow velocities in the down - wind streams .",
    "@xcite focused on studying the inflating bubble behind pulsars by using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "they concluded that the shockwaves provide the thermalized energy into the bubble , allowing it to expand continuously .",
    "however , because the evolution of large - scale bubbles and bow - shock are non - relativistic , we carried out purely non - relativistic hydrodynamic simulations , for reasons of computational feasibility .",
    "we compared our results with relativistic pulsar wind model in @xcite , and it shows no noticeable differences in the dynamics of pwne . to verify that the non - relativistic evolution of the bow - shock and bubble are correctly reproduced by our simulations",

    ".    the pulsar wind is injected isotropically at a spherical boundary of radius @xmath24 centered on the coordinate origin in our grid .",
    "we refer to this injection region as the _ nozzle_. because we inject the wind at asymptotic velocity , the injection radius @xmath25 of the nozzle is arbitrary , but must be smaller than the standoff distance @xmath21 , which we verified for each simulation .",

    "to resolve the pulsar wind and bow - shock structure appropriately , we set the ( adaptive ) numerical resolution around the pulsar to have at least 10 cells across @xmath24 .      rather than simulating a moving pulsar in a stationary medium , we fix the pulsar s location at @xmath30 for all runs .",

    "the pulsar breaks out of the bubble producing a bow - shock structure . because the goal of this study is to understand bow - shock evolution when a pulsar propagates through a non - uniform density medium , the density gradient / discontinuity is introduced at the left boundary with varying boundary condition after the bow - shock structure is well developed,@xmath38 , and converged into the analytically expected shape [ eq .",

    "simulations were primarily carried out in axi - symmetry , i.e. , 2-d , for the purpose of saving computing resources .",
    "we carried out two types of 3-d simulations : one for validating 2-d runs , and a set of 3-d runs for studying the non - axisymmetric case ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "the latter case investigates a density discontinuity at an angle relative to the pulsar velocity .",
    "we investigated two cases : inclination angles of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , and the result will be discussed at  [ subsec : asym ] .",
    "the global evolution of the down - wind shock structure is generally similar to that of supersonic low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) described in @xcite , despite the different engine in the two systems . around the pulsar , the unperturbed pulsar wind propagates to the termination shock where the wind slows down to subsonic speed because of its interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "the bow - shock becomes quasi - conical on the down - stream side ( with an opening angle comparable to the mach angle ) .",
    "within the down - wind cone , the shocked pulsar wind propagates away from the pulsar due to the pressure gradient behind the bow - shock .",
    "the tail continues to drive the conical down - wind bow - shock as long as its pressure exceeds the thermal pressure in the ambient medium .",
    "the bow - shock tail can be described as a narrow ( cylindrical ) cavity filled with relativistic exhaust from the pulsar .    as discussed in @xcite , the shape of the cavity along the @xmath33-axis",

    "furthermore , in this model , the h@xmath0 emission in the second bubble should be brighter than that in the first bubble due to the enhanced ambient density .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed features , at which the h@xmath0 emission of the second bubble - like structure is a factor of 5 dimmer than that of the first bubble @xcite .",
    "based on the intuition gained from the simulations presented above , we propose the following scenario for producing the guitar shape of the nebula as the result of the pulsar traversing a region of low and decreasing density before re - entering a higher density region : ( 1 ) the first ( larger ) bubble is produced when the pulsar passes through a low density discontinuity .",

    "note that we generated 3-d data based on the 2-d axi - symmetric results to obtain the projected h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the ionization balance in the shocked gas was calculated by the mapping iii code @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the shocked shell is above @xmath107 k , thus the gas is nearly fully ionized .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : guitar ] shows the surface brightness in h@xmath0 for the model .",
    "the surface brightness around the rim of the bubble is about @xmath108 , which is consistent with the h@xmath0 observation @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath106 emission of the inflated structure between the bubble and the pulsar is a factor of 7 dimmer than that of the rim of the bubble due to the low density in the medium , which is consistent with the observation .",
    "note that the bright emission far down - stream beyond the bubbles ( on the fourth dashed line on the right - hand - side of the image ) does not have a corresponding feature in the observed map .",
    "however , given that we can not constrain the ratio of the density in this region of the flow other than saying that it must be higher than in region ( b ) , since no observed features have been identified in this region of the flow , the simulation should not be expected to reproduce the results .",
    "the bubble is flattened toward the discontinuity because the high density suppresses the expansion of the bubble in this region .",

    "the chosen density structure in the simulations ( plane parallel with simple uniform regions ) is clearly an over - simplification .",
    "however , given the multi - phase nature of the ism it is reasonable that the pulsar will transverse density inhomogeneities of scale similar to the size of the guitar ( roughly of order a parsec ) .",

    "the structure of the density discontinuity is unconstrained on scales significantly later than the guitar body size .    in the simulation ,",

    "the upper bow - shock is about 3.5 times wider than the lower bow - shock , and the upper one has a broader shape . the origin of the asymmetry has been elusive and can not be explained by the interaction of an isotropic pulsar wind with a homogeneous ambient medium .",
    "more interestingly , a kink - like shape , which is a factor of  2 brighter than the nebula average , appears in the lower bow - shock ( denoted by `` k '' in figure  [ fig : gaensler ] ) .",
    "one possible reason for the asymmetry in the bow - shock is that the density in the region to the north of the pulsar is lower than in the south , with the pulsar currently crossing a density discontinuity that is inclined with respect to the pulsar s velocity vector ( different from the geometry discussed so far ) .",
    "if we assume that the asymmetry in psr j2124 - 3358 is caused by the differences in ambient density between the northern and the southern side , we can estimate the relative densities from by - eye fits of analytic bow - shock models for different densities ; five such models are overlaid on the observed bow - shock ( right panel of figure  [ fig : gaensler ] ) . for the analytic lines , we adopted the pulsar s spin - down loss energy of @xmath131 @xcite and the projected space velocity of @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the ambient medium of the upper region may be approximately 40 times less dense than that of the lower region , unless there is bulk motion of the ambient gas to decrease the angle of the lower bow - shock .",
    "the upper half of the bow - shock deviates from a simple analytic model farther back along the flow ( denoted by a yellow circle in the figure ) .",
    "the analytic lines converge to become parallel to the pulsar s velocity vector after @xmath133 , because the momentum flux of the ism pushes the bow - shock backward due to the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "however , the observed bow - shock has an opening angle of @xmath134 ( cyan dashed line in figure  [ fig : gaensler ] ) .",
    "this deviation may be caused by an overestimate in the distance to the pulsar and/or the uncertainty in the viewing angle of the bow - shock , i.e. , the angle between the velocity vector and the line of sight : if the distance is shorter than estimated , the bow - shock of downstream likely retains a larger opening angle in two reasons .",
    "first , in the case of a shorter distance ( i.e. smaller physical size of the observed structure ) , the bow - shock may not reach the region where it becomes parallel to the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "second , the pulsar s velocity should be lower than the estimated one , implying that the opening angle of the bow - shock is likely wider than what we can see from the analytic lines in the figure .",
    "alternatively , this mismatch may be produced by the formation of flow instabilities as the pulsar passes the density gradient .",
    "this will be discussed in detail below .",
    "@xcite argued that the asymmetric bow - shock structure is caused by the combination of three components : a density gradient in the ism , a bulk flow in the ambient medium , and an anisotropy in the pulsar wind .",
    "however , in their semi - analytic models for the structure , an inclination angle between the pulsar s velocity vector and the density discontinuity can not be taken into consideration due to the complexity . in the models ,",
    "the density gradient was either perpendicular or parallel .",
    "to study the effect of the inclination angle @xmath135 of the density discontinuity relative to the proper motion of the pulsar , we carried out a 3-d hydrodynamic simulation of a bow - shock pwn in which the pulsar moves into a lower - density medium such that its velocity vector is inclined with respect to the transition layer at an angle of @xmath136 .",
    "this angle is chosen somewhat arbitrarily , but is set to be small enough to reproduce bow - shock structures that are distinct between the shock generated at the low ambient density the pulsar is propagating into and the shock generated at the initial , higher ambient density in the medium the pulsar is initially traveling through .",
    "if the angle is larger than the opening angle of the bow - shock in the low - density medium ( cyan dashed line in the right panel of figure  [ fig : gaensler ] ) , the shape of the bow - shock will become more symmetric .",
    "the rather complicated shape of bow - shock in the psr j2124 - 3358 ( e.g. , the presence of two kink - like structures ; see figure  [ fig : gaensler ] ) requires a small inclination angle .",
    "the generation of the complicated structures will be discussed in detail below .",
    "unlike the semi - analytic model in @xcite , our model focuses only on the variation of the ambient density along the pulsar s passage without taking any anisotropy in the pulsar wind into consideration .",
    "an accurate to - scale 3-d simulation of the j2124 - 3358 bow - shock would require an unreasonable amount of computing time for the bow - shock to establish , given the small courant time step imposed by the pulsar wind velocity . for computational expedience , we thus approximated the system using a non - relativistic 3-d model similar to the other models used in this paper , the parameters of which are given in table  [ tab : param ] ( l10_1000_5deg ) .",
    "the primary aim of the simulations is to explore whether the asymmetry of pulsar wind bow - shocks can be produced by simple inhomogeneities in the environment .    in our numerical model ,",
    "the ambient density decreases to 1/10 of the initial density @xmath19 across a transition zone , with a smooth density transition over a length scale @xmath137 , such that the pulsar encounters a projected transition length scale @xmath138 in the direction of motion , i.e. , the x - direction , which is 100 times larger than the standoff distance of the pulsar wind .",
    "the transition length is crucial for determining how rapidly the bow - shock expands while the density is changing . if the transition length is small compared to standoff distance ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) , as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : discontinuity ] , the tip of the bow - shock head inflates in a short time , producing an expanding bubble - like structure behind the pulsar .",
    "however , if the transition length is sufficiently large , the evolution of the bow - shock head and trail is smooth without bubble formation because the radius of curvature of the bow - shock head increases and the trail becomes flat ( see  [ subsubsec : head ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : inc ] shows the temporal evolution of the density while the pulsar moves into the low density medium .",
    "the transition area is marked with a red dot - dashed line , and the white cross represents the pulsar ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the magenta lines are the analytic solutions for the bow - shock in uniform medium with ambient density @xmath19 ( lower line ) and with 1/10 @xmath19 ( upper line ) , respectively .    at early stages of the simulation ,",
    "the bow - shock is symmetric .",
    "however , as expected , it becomes asymmetric after the pulsar moves into the low density medium ; the width of the neck @xmath51 , and the asymptotic bow - shock angle , @xmath140 , are inversely - proportional to the ambient density .",
    "we ignore the evolution of the initial bubble , since it is unrelated to the crossing of the density discontinuity ( it is formed as the pulsar turns on at the start of the simulation , as discussed above ) , and only focus on the properties of the bow - shock .",
    "we note that in the yellow area , the bow - shock shows a deformation that deviates somewhat from the analytic line .",
    "this is because although the transition length @xmath141 is long enough to avoid the generation of an expanding bubble , the sudden change of stand - off distance shortly makes the shock unstable while the pulsar is passing the transition zone .",
    "it is plausible that the kink - like structure observed in the bow - shock of j2124 - 3358 is produced by a similar instability at the intersection between the bow - shock and the transition layer .        for comparison , we also performed a simulation with the larger inclination angle of @xmath142 and a transition length of @xmath143 figure  [ fig : inc45 ] shows the time evolution of the density map in this case . as we discussed above , the zero transition layer ( or , @xmath144 ) results in the production of expanding bubble rather than the smooth change of bow - shock morphology . in this case",
    ", the asymmetric feature appears only when the pulsar is in the bubble : after the pulsar breaks out of the bubble , it recedes from the transition layer , producing a symmetric bow - shock .",
    "however , the round shape of the bubble is not consistent with the overall shock morphology of j2124 - 3358 , although a kink - like structure appears at the intersection between the lower bow - shock and the transition layer ( denoted by `` k '' in the figure ) .",

    ", the pulsar velocity @xmath20 is of 2 orders of magnitude less than the speed of light , and the expansion velocity of the bubble and neck are correspondingly smaller , which is manifestly non - relativistic .",

    "we applied this analysis to the head and bow - shock of the guitar nebula , and suggest that the pulsar in the nebula is currently moving through a density - decrease .",
