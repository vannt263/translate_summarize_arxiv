    "leaves are responsible for intercepting light and creating sugars from photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the ability of a plant to produce biomass , to grow and reproduce ( in other words to compete for survival ) depends on the efficiency of photosynthesis .",
    "photosynthesis yield depends on various parameters , mainly gas exchange , leaf temperature and light interception @xcite .",
    "different factors may have a role on those key parameters : leaf perspiration , stomata aperture and ability to flutter may alter heat and gas exchange at the level of the leaf @xcite .",
    "leaf orientation towards the sun s rays plays a key role for light interception @xcite and different strategies have been adopted by the vegetal kingdom . in the first strategy , leaf orientation has no preferred direction to collect diffuse light that comes from every direction . in the second strategy",
    ", leaves have to be properly oriented to collect direct sun light .",
    "more complex strategies to improve the rate of photosynthesis also exist , giving rise to rather dynamical plant behaviour depending on environmental parameters .",
    "one example is the time - dependent orientation of leaves to follow the sun s position in the sky , but they can be even more complex .",
    "for instance , during a drought period , the inability to access water from the soil prevents the plant from perspiring .",
    "the leaf - refreshing effect of transpiration is cancelled , leaf temperature increases and the rate of photosynthesis drop to zero .",
    "to avoid such dramatic loss , leaves orientations are changed to intercept less light , reduce leaf temperature and keep leaves active for photosynthesis , @xcite .",
    "because of these reasons , one may think that leaf orientation , leaf shape and leaf size would be parameters subjected to strong pressure of selection because of their role in light interception",
    ". the design of the leaf ( thickness , length , width , petiole , midvein , secondary veins , etc . ) must be optimal to obtain the larger rates of photosynthesis without threatening the plant s life .",
    "the highest photosynthetic rates of plants can reach up to 30% with a mean rate around 3% @xcite . in this context , it is surprising to observe such a variability in leaf shape , sizes and orientations ( see fig . [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "discussions about plant mechanical optimality make a long story .",
    "the first authors to introduce the concept of plant design constrained by mechanics were @xcite , who proposed that tree height and tree width are bound features .",
    "a few discussions of plant optimality concern branches @xcite and leaves @xcite , and @xcite have shown that leaf size is limited by optimal sap flow in tall trees .",

    "some bio - material used to make the leaf must be dedicated to create surface area for light interception , but the rest of the bio - material should be used for mechanical self - support . on the one hand ,",
    "if too little bio - material is used for self - support , the leaf will hang down and despite the large amount of bio - material used to create surface area , it will not intercept much light . on the other hand ,",
    "if too much bio - material is used for self - support , the leaf will be properly oriented to intercept light but will have no surface area to collect light .",
    "an optimal mass allocation trade - off exists between those two extrema",
    ". what would be the shape of a leaf that has optimally allocated biomass ?",
    "note that when no self - support is needed , all the biomass would be used to create surface area for light interception .",
    "this is the case for water lilies that occupy the interface between air and water .",
    "answering questions considering optimality in nature is not easy because of the large number of functions performed by an organ and because of the still larger number of environmental parameters to take into account .",
    "those functions may naturally encourage antagonistic shapes ; for instance , the optimal leaf would be thin enough to have a large surface area - to - volume ratio to enhance gas and heat exchange , but also thick enough for efficient transport of water and sap in xylem and phloem .",
    "abiotic and biotic stresses are also shaping factors for the leaf .",
    "for example , a leaf may be designed to flutter to increase photosynthesis rate @xcite , to expel water drops and prevent fungus attacks or simply to remove hervibory insects @xcite .",
    "leaves have also developed mechanical tricks to be stiffer for the same amount of bio - material and thus to reduce the amount of biomass needed to support their own weight .",
    "those tricks are ( i ) the inhomogeneity of the leaf tissues ( xylem and phloem vessels are much more lignified -and thus stiffer- tissues than mesenchymatous cells . ) , ( ii ) the anisotropic placement of the tissues and ( iii ) the shape of the leaf itself .",
    "for instance , the shape of the leaf could lead to a stiffer u - shaped petiole @xcite or stiffer lamina through curvature - induced rigidity @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the trade - off between self - support and creation of surface area for light interception . our approach is based on a basic mechanical modelling of the leaf which neglects the different stresses or parameters of selection that apply on leaves , nor on the complex mechanical tricks developed to enhance leaf rigidity while minimizing biomass use .",
    "optimal leaf shape is examined for the giant monocots leaves , especially palms of palm trees and banana trees .",
    "palm trees belong to the large family of _ arecaceae _ ( more than 2600 species ) within the monocots clade . in this family ,",
    "plants exhibit leaves of different sizes and different shapes .",
    "we choose here to study plants with consistent , simple leaf geometry : one short petiole and one long lamina with one major vein .",
    "in the first part of this article we take advantage of this simple geometry to describe theoretically what would be the optimal leaf of a palm tree . in the second part of this article",
    ", we describe the measurements done on actual palm trees and banana trees .",
    "finally , we compare the theoretical results with the measurements on monocot trees .",
    "we show that the shape of larger leaves is close to the predicted optimal shape whereas the smallest palms shapes differ strongly from prediction .",
    "we predict a minimal size for which our model applies . for smaller leaves , self - support does not appear to be the strongest factor of selection .",
    "we aim at modelling what would be the optimal shape of a leaf under mechanical self - support constraints .",
    "we develop here a simple model based on mechanical considerations . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "mechanical and geometrical assumptions are made for the considered leaf .",
    "we detail the assumptions as follow : first , the geometry of the considered leaf is chosen as the geometry of a palm of _",
    "phoenix canariensis_. such a palm is composed of a short petiole that quickly becomes the midvein of the palm . the diameter of the midvein at the base of the lamina is denoted @xmath1 .",
    "the lamina has a length @xmath2 , a width @xmath3 and a thickness @xmath4 .",
    "the leaf geometrical properties are sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "second , we consider that all the bio - material used to create the leaf is isotropic , has the same young modulus @xmath5 and the same density @xmath6 .",
    "its production needs the same amount of bio - energy . under this strong assumption",
    ", we neglect the inhomogeneity of the different tissues that comprise the leaf ( xylem / phloem vessels , mesenchymatous cells , cuticle , etc . )",
    "those tissues have non - similar mechanical properties .",
    "this will be discussed in the last part of the paper as well as the growth process .",
    "third , we also neglect all mechanical tricks to strengthen the midvein such as u - shaped midvein @xcite , turgidity - dependent rigidity @xcite and curvature induced rigidity of the lamina @xcite .",
    "fourth , for the sake of simplicity , we consider that the petiole is clamped perpendicular to the gravity . finally , we assume that the midvein weight is negligible compared to the lamina weight .",
    "this assumption can be easily released and optimal shapes can be computed numerically but it does not permit to access analytical solutions any more .",

    "second , the evolution of the data with the scaling laws are consistent .",
    "third , the prefactors of the model yield an estimation of the parameter close to their absolute value .",
    "one may notice that the _ sica _ leaf does not follow the general trend for any of the parameters .",
    "such a leaf is not optimally designed for self - support consistently with our observation ; gravity does not impact the shape of a mature _ sica _ leaf . as a general rule , when a leaf does not change of shape when gravity is reversed ( moulia s test ) , for instance when its curvature does not change when flipped upside down , the leaf is too stiff and not optimally designed for self - support .",
    "to build such a leaf , too much biomass was used for self - support and one may think that others factors of selection prevail .",
    "the agreement between experiment and prediction supports our hypothesis that leaves are optimally designed for self - support .",
    "the discrepancy in terms of absolute value may come from the simplification of the geometry of the leaf made in the model ( see section [ model_assumptions ] ) .",
    "for all the leaves considered here , the midvein is not cylindrical but cone - shaped .",
    "also , the non - uniform elasticity of the leaf can explain the difference between measurements and theory .",
    "finally , the mechanical tricks make the leaf stiffer with the same amount of bio - material and thus must increase the length and the width of the leaf .",
    "we expected that our predictions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 would be lower than the measured values , which is the case .",
    "note that palms are composed by separated leaflets which reduce the apparent density and increase @xmath3 and @xmath2 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale_l ] ) and ( [ eq : scale_w ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the model predicts the leaves thickness for most of the leaves presented here but does not predict accurately the measurements for the smallest _",
    "sica _ leaf , which is too stiff compared to the optimal self - support prediction .",
    "there is a minimal size of leaves for which the proposed model applies .",
    "if we consider that a leaf can not be thinner than 100 @xmath36 m , we obtain a critical leaf length of 23 cm and a critical width of 4 cm ( for @xmath78 pa , @xmath79 kg.@xmath28 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "this means that small leaves encountered in nature are too stiff and thus not optimized for self - support .",
    "other selection parameters may influence on these leaves to determine their shape . among these constraints ,",
    "two example are wind resistance and resistance to tearing .",
    "also , @xcite discussed the maximal size of leaves resulting from the optimality of sap flow efficiency .",
    "our study shows that some large leaves are subjected to biomass allocation optimization .",
    "but , one may ask if it is preferable to concentrate much of the biomass of the tree in one leaf or if it is more efficient to create a large bunch of small leaves . according to our approach",
    ", there is no optimal position on this point .",
    "indeed , the volume of the leaf dedicated to light interception is @xmath81 that scales as @xmath82 . in proportion ,",
    "the amount of leaf useful for light interception is independent of the size of the leaf ; having a bunch of small leaves or only one huge leaf of the same volume gives the same results in terms of light interception .",
    "in reality , the repartition between surface and thickness is different .",
    "a bunch of small leaves will have a larger surface to intercept light but a smaller thickness .",
    "this indicates that the transmission coefficient of the small leaves should be larger than the one of large leaves .",
    "this particularity of leaf shape might lead to different light interception strategies : ( i ) in a strong light environment , a thick lamina allows a leaf to intercept a lot of light directly ( light interception is exponential with lamina thickness ) , whereas a thin lamina will intercept less light and thus transmit more to under canopy leaves .",
    "one large leaf is favourable in this light environment .",
    "( ii ) in a low light environment , a thin leaf already intercepts all of the available light .",
    "being thicker is no longer efficient to intercept more light .",
    "however , with thin leaves the potential surface area of light interception is larger than with thick leaves .",
    "a bunch of small leaves is beneficial in such an environment .",
    "furthermore , areas with a strongly lit environment are located close to the inter - tropical region , where the light is mainly direct light and thus the sun - leaf orientation matters . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the available light is lower intensity and diffuse light that does not come from a preferred direction - leaf orientation does not matter .",
    "this reinforces our earlier point : in the inter - tropical region , leaves have to deal with strong direct light , so building one leaf properly oriented ( _ i.e. _ horizontal ) is favourable whereas in higher latitude regions , building a bunch of small leaves oriented in different direction would be more efficient in low and diffuse light environment . because of these points , it may not be surprising that large palm trees are found in inter - tropical regions rather than close to the poles .",
    "this hypothesis that leaf size is repartitioned with earth s latitude needs to be verified in a statistical manner .",
    "many selection factors may influence the leaf shape or change the optimal leaf size ; see for instance the paper by @xcite .",
    "our analysis has many biases on which we comment in the following : ( i ) there are many shapes of leaves in nature .",
    "we believe that for large leaves , arguments of optimal biomass usage would lead to similar results regardless the actual shape of the leaf .",
    "( ii ) the leaf is created with a growth process that tends to change the mechanical properties of the leaf ( pre - stresses , inhomogeneities , natural curvatures ) .",
    "we believe that the arguments presented here apply regardless of the mechanical specificity of each leaf .",
    "this is because the dependence on global shape is much stronger than the dependence on any mechanical trick ( see exponents in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale_l ] ) , ( [ eq : scale_w ] ) , ( [ eq : scale_t ] ) and ( [ eq : scale_d ] ) , always smaller than 1/2 ) . the leaves which measured dimensions are strongly different from predictions of the model would be leaves with a different strategy of orientation for light collection ( such as diffuse light collection ) or fulfilling other selection parameters",
    "this study shows that large leaves , as the palms studied here , are optimized to support themselves for direct light interception . however , most of the leaves of terrestrial plants are oversized for self - support and thus not optimal .",
    "leaf over - sizing is easily observable : when you take a small leaf in your hand and flip it regarding the gravity , nothing happens and the leaf keeps its own curvature which results from growth ( moulia s test ) .",
    "this over - sizing supports the idea that different selection pressures are more relevant to explain the shape of the leaf rather than the one exposed in this paper . among these selection pressures",
    "are storm survival , drought resistance , herbivory resistance , and enhancement of heat and gas exchange .",
    "the large number of selection pressures indicates that leaves are multi - functional organs for which the shape is the result of a complex trade - off .",
    "however , depending on leaf fitness , environment , and life history , one among those selection pressures may play a stronger role into leaf shaping than the others .",
    "the determination of which selective pressures shape the leaf in a given environment is a fascinating question that still requires further investigation . a better understanding of how competing selective pressure favours some leaves shapes has strong agricultural implications , e.g. the artificial selection of plants to adapt to non - native habitats .",
    "another perspective of this work could be to relax some assumptions made in the model .",
    "particularly , the simple geometry of palm leaves assumed in the model can be extended to other geometries using an evolutionary algorithm .",
    "we expect that such a procedure would predict the optimal geometry of a large leaf with more details ( the midvein geometry , lamina shape and even the presence of secondary veins ) .",
