    "quasielastic studies are traditionally a good source of information about nuclear and nucleon structure . the main tool has been usually represented by electron scattering experiments , since in this case the elementary probe - nucleon reaction mechanism is regarded to be under better control .",
    "however , not all the possible nuclear response functions can be accessed in this way and , furthermore , the extraction from the data of the response functions that enter electron scattering can be model dependent .",
    "hadronic probes are an alternative source of quasielastic data . among them",
    "it is particularly interesting the case of @xmath0-nucleus scattering , since , for kaon laboratory momenta below 800 mev / c , the elementary @xmath0-nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction is much weaker than other hadron - nucleon interactions .",
    "in fact , a weaker elementary interaction allows the projectile to penetrate deeper inside the nucleus , thus probing regions of higher density and , consequently , being more sensitive to collective phenomena .",
    "such an experiment has been performed at bnl , where quasielastic @xmath0-nucleus double - differential cross sections have been measured for kaons with a laboratory momentum of 705 mev / c , using d , c , ca and pb as targets @xcite .",
    "data have been taken for scattering at 24@xmath5 , 34@xmath5 and 43@xmath5 , corresponding to approximately fixed momentum transfers of 290 , 390 and 480 mev / c . in the case of c ,",
    "the data have been taken for all the momenta , whereas for ca and pb they are available at 290 and 480 mev / c .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the data have been analyzed using various relativistic models to describe the nuclear dynamics ; on the other hand , the distortion of the incoming kaons has been accounted for employing a very simple model , based on the effective number of nucleons participating in the reaction , @xmath6 ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : hp ] ) .",
    "the `` experimental '' values found for @xmath6 are @xmath7 higher than the ones calculated in the glauber theory .",
    "this finding is rather puzzling , also in view of the fact that multiple scattering theory underestimates the nuclear elastic scattering data @xcite , a fact which has been interpreted as a signal of an enhancement of the in - medium @xmath4 cross section . as also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quasielastic cross section is , in general , proportional to the elementary single differential @xmath4 cross section and to the effective number of participating nucleons , the latter depending , in turn , on the total @xmath4 cross section ( see sec .  [ subsec : hp ] for details ) . at the energy of the experiment ,",
    "@xmath4 scattering is nearly isotropic , so that the differential and total cross sections are proportional ; however , an increase in the @xmath4 cross section reduces @xmath6 ( and viceversa ) , leaving a quasielastic cross section little dependent on the input @xmath4 amplitudes .",
    "thus , the quasifree experiment on the one side does not shed light on the elastic scattering data and , on the other , it seems to pose another puzzling problem .    in this paper",
    "we would like to reanalyze the @xmath0-nucleus quasielastic data , using a more realistic model for the reaction mechanism ,  already applied to ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) quasifree scattering @xcite ,  based on a consistent implementation of glauber theory for quasifree scattering .",
    "the nuclear dynamics has been treated through a finite nucleus continuum random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculation , also accounting for the coupling of the particle - hole ( ph ) states to higher order configurations ( spreading width ) .",
    "the dynamics is non - relativistic , but the correct relativistic kinematics has been used .",
    "we will show that the puzzling experimental outcome for @xmath6 is very likely an artifact of the naive fitting procedure employed in the analysis of the data and that a realistic ( and _ without free parameters _ ) theoretical framework has no difficulties in giving a rather accurate description of the experimental cross sections .    in sec .",

    "the most relevant consequence of this choice of frame is that the elementary projectile - nucleon amplitudes should be evaluated at an effective laboratory kinetic energy defined by @xmath140 @xmath141 and @xmath128 being the projectile mass and momentum , respectively .",

    "next , we would like to discuss the uncertainties connected to the choice of the effective ph interaction for quasielastic calculations .",
    "the knowledge of the latter suffers , in general , from many shortcomings : when it is theoretically calculated ,  as the one we employ here ( see sec .  [ subsec : eff - int ] ) ,  sources of uncertainties arise because of the specific many - body scheme which has been adopted , from relativistic effects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an effective interaction along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , but in a relativistic context ) and from the approximations made in the actual calculations or in extrapolating to the ph kinematical regime ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : eff - int ] ) ; when the effective interaction is just fitted to phenomenological properties , it can suffer from ambiguities in the parameterization ( many sets of parameters reproducing the same body of data ) and from the limited range of momenta which is covered ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite for a phenomenological density - dependent interaction expressed in terms of migdal - landau parameters at @xmath146 ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can of course reverse the argument and use the quasielastic studies to gain insight into the effective ph interaction at momentum transfers of a few hundreds mev .",
    "one obvious difficulty in this case is related to the fact that it is not always possible to disentangle the various spin - isospin channels : the only reaction for which this has been achieved is the ( @xmath147 ) charge - exchange one , where the separated isovector spin - longitudinal and spin - transverse responses have been extracted @xcite .",
    "however , the strong interaction of protons with nuclei constrains that reaction to the low density peripheral region of the nucleus , making it little sensitive to rpa effects ; moreover , while the spin - longitudinal channel can be well described , the transverse one shows much more strength than expected @xcite . in this",

    "[ fig : amplitudes ] , the scalar - isoscalar channel is largely dominant , making this reaction a `` quasipure '' probe of the @xmath50 mode .    whatever be the attitude towards this problem , we believe it is useful to gain some feeling about the sensitivity of the collective effects to the input effective potential . for this purpose , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : rpa ] , for the four spin - isospin channels , the surface rpa response functions at @xmath144 mev / c , calculated with the ph interaction discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : eff - int ] , comparing them to the rpa responses calculated with the same interaction scaled by @xmath148 .",

    "@xcite gives too much attraction : as discussed by the authors , the extracted @xmath149 landau parameter makes nuclear matter unstable , a shortcoming that can be cured by higher order contributions channel has been shown to be reduced by nearly a factor @xmath150 at @xmath151 ; however , in the range of momenta of interest to us , the relativistic and non - relativistic @xmath83-matrices appear to be comparable . ] .",
    "thus , while the case with the interaction increased by @xmath152 is taken mainly for illustrative purposes , the case with a weaker interaction is somewhat more realistic .    by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa ] one can note the following :    \\i ) the dependence of the responses on the potential is somehow desensitized by the rpa chain : for the @xmath50 mode the variation of the response function at the left of the qep is typically about @xmath153 , apart from the very low energy region ( @xmath154 mev ) , where it grows up to @xmath155 ; for the other modes , still at the left of the qep , the variation is always much smaller , say @xmath156 ;    \\ii ) at the right of the qep the effect of correlations is much smaller , being limited to a few per cent for the @xmath50 mode and to practically nothing for the other modes ;    \\iii ) the relatively weak sensitivity of the isovector and spin channels to variations of the input potential makes the small ( @xmath157 ) contamination from these modes in the @xmath0-nucleus cross section rather stable with respect to uncertainties due to correlations , enhancing the argument in favour of this reaction as a probe of the scalar - isoscalar channel .    the results if fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa ] are given for @xmath144 mev / c : similar considerations apply also to the lowest momenta .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : c12 ] one can see the data for the quasielastic @xmath0-c cross section @xcite compared to our calculations . in the theoretical cross sections , besides the case with free response functions ( dotted ) , there are included the nuclear responses corresponding to the interaction of sec .",
    "[ subsec : eff - int ] ( solid ) and to a reduction of @xmath152 of the same interaction ( dashed ) ; the curves include the two - step contribution , which is also shown separately ( dot - dashed ) .    from inspection of the figure",
    ", one sees that the strength of the cross sections on the right hand side of the qep is well reproduced by both the correlated and the free responses ( apart from the very high energy tail ) at all the momentum transfers ; however , at the lowest momenta the data show a clear distortion of the typical quasielastic shape , which is not compatible with the uncorrelated cross sections .",
    "the experimental energy resolution is not sufficient to cut out the elastic scattering contribution ; moreover , low - lying discrete nuclear excitations are much affected by the detail of the nuclear model ( such as shell model parameters and spreading width ) .",
    "if , for these reasons , one excludes the very low energy tail ( say , @xmath158 mev ) it appears that the model with a weaker ph interaction gives a remarkably good description of the data at @xmath1 and @xmath2 mev / c .    at the highest momentum , the elastic contamination and the discrete excitations",
    "have been washed out ; the interaction in both the correlated models is sufficiently weak to cause little distortion of the quasifree shape , but the low energy part of the spectrum seems again to favour the model with the weaker ph interaction .",
    "it is worth noticing the smallness of the two - step contribution , which is at most a few per cent of the one - step term at @xmath144 mev / c : this can be contrasted , for instance , to the isovector spin - transverse response to 500 mev protons , where one finds , at @xmath159 mev / c , a sizeable @xmath153 contribution from two - step processes @xcite .",
    "protons of 500 mev of kinetic energy have a squared momentum which is roughly twice the one of 700 mev / c kaons ; furthermore , the two - step factor @xmath160 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r2 ] ) and ( [ eq : d2 ] ) is larger by roughly a factor two for the kaon reaction ,  because of the smaller probe - nucleon total cross section @xmath115 ,  but this is compensated by the factor two arising from the two possible orderings of the charge - exchange reaction ( see formula ( 8) of ref .",
    "hence , apart from a factor 2 in the coefficient , the relative weight of the two - step term in the two reactions has to be driven by the elementary amplitudes entering ( [ eq : r2 ] ) ( the response functions being in all the cases the free ones ) , that is by the factor @xmath161 in the analogous expression for the ( @xmath9 ) reaction , @xmath99 being the external momentum and @xmath162 the integration variable , whereas @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the isovector spin - transverse and the scalar - isoscalar @xmath165 amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the different size of the two - step contributions is indeed determined by the different strength and the different momentum behaviour of the above amplitudes : in the kaon case , the scalar - isoscalar amplitude has little momentum dependence , so that @xmath166 is roughly between one and two , while the remaining squared amplitude is on average @xmath167  mb ( in the laboratory ) ; on the other hand , for the ( @xmath9 ) reaction at @xmath159 mev / c , the ratio @xmath168 is typically in the range @xmath169 , whereas the remaining amplitude gives contributions mainly in the range from 10 to 22 mb . in qualitative words , we can say that because the @xmath165 cross section is relatively forward peaked ,  unlike the @xmath134 one ,  a double scattering in which the momentum transfer @xmath10 is shared by the two nucleons is favored in the @xmath165 case with respect to the @xmath134 one .    finally , we display also the available data for ca at @xmath1 and @xmath3 mev / c ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ca40 ] ) . to these figures",
    "one can apply the same considerations made for the carbon data , although the preference for the weaker ph effective potential is even more clear now , since in heavier nuclei collective effects tend to be stronger .",
    "indeed , the sensitivity of the response functions to variations in the input potential is a little more pronounced in @xmath170ca than in @xmath143c , being about @xmath171 for a @xmath152 change of the potential in the @xmath50 channel , to be compared to the @xmath153 sensitivity found in @xmath143c ( see the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa ] ) . also the two - step contribution is ,",
    "as expected , larger in @xmath170ca than in @xmath143c .",
    "from the discussion in the previous section , it appears that the model presented here gives a good description of the quasielastic @xmath0 data , the main uncertainty being related to the strength of the effective ph interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "a good description of the data was achieved by using the interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite quenched by @xmath152 .",
    "it was shown that the use of this interaction with the full strength led to results in clear contradiction with the data .",
    "indeed , there are theoretical indications that the strength of this interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel should be reduced . on the other hand , from figs .",
    "[ fig : c12 ] and [ fig : ca40 ] one can see that the @xmath0 data can be used to constrain the strength of the ph potential for the @xmath50 mode .",
    "there are , however , two issues that need to be commented upon , namely the reported high experimental values for the effective number of nucleons @xmath6 @xcite ( see the introduction ) and the comparison with the available calculations for this reaction that employ relativistic dynamical models @xcite .",
    "concerning the first point , it might appear curious that the `` experimental '' value for @xmath6 quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite be @xmath7 higher than the one calculated in the glauber model , since we have seen that the latter gives a nice estimate of the quasielastic cross sections .",
    "a source of error may of course be given by the use of the effective number approximation ( [ eq : neff - approx ] ) ; however , we believe that the main reason for the overestimate of @xmath6 lies in the way followed to extract the effective number from the data @xcite . indeed , @xmath6 has been obtained by integrating the quasielastic data over the whole range of transferred energies : in order to do this , the data have been fitted with gaussian distributions and , although a subtraction of the elastic scattering and low energy excited levels contributions has been attempted , _ no subtraction for any high energy background has been included_. from figs .",
    "[ fig : c12 ] and [ fig : ca40 ] it appears that the very high energy tail of the cross sections is underestimated by the calculations , both for the free and the correlated models ( remember , from the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , that while rpa correlations sizably affect the low energy side of the qep , they have little influence on the high energy part ) .",
    "the data actually seem to show some structure beyond the ph response region : in the case of quasifree electron scattering , the strength in this region is attributed to effects beyond rpa ( such as meson - exchange currents or 2p2h excitations ) .",
    "note also that a simple , `` straight line '' , estimate of the background brings the value of @xmath6 in close agreement with the glauber estimate @xcite .",
    "meson - exchange currents effects tied to the interaction of the kaon with the nuclear pion cloud have been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite and found to lead to small corrections to the @xmath0-nucleus total cross section .",
    "the consideration of contact terms using chiral lagrangians makes the corrections even smaller @xcite , so that this source of corrections can not account for the strength at large values of @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the tail of the @xmath172 excitation reaches this region , since the @xmath172 acquires a finite width , even below the pion production threshold , due to the @xmath173 reaction in the nucleus .",
    "hence , the channel of kaon induced @xmath172 excitation in nuclei should become a target of both theoretical and experimental investigation in order to further clarify these issues .    concerning the calculations with relativistic models of refs .",
    "@xcite , it is obviously difficult to make a comparison with our results , since in those papers the rpa response functions ( calculated in a variety of models ) have been multiplied by the `` experimental '' @xmath6 , so that their strength is just fitted to the data ( of course , the use of the calculated value for @xmath6 would result in a general underestimate of the cross sections ) .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the relativistic rpa isoscalar response is _ quenched _ , in contrast to our non - relativistic rpa response , which is mainly shifted to the left and enhanced at very low energies .",
    "then , it is clear that this quenching has to be compensated by a higher @xmath6 . also to be noticed is the fact that the relativistic rpa calculations are able to describe ( albeit through a fit of the total cross section ) only the data at high momentum transfers . at @xmath1",
    "mev / c , the large enhancement in the cross section visible at moderate energy transfers ( @xmath174 ) is clearly not predicted , even in a finite nucleus calculation @xcite , in contrast to our non - relativistic results .    of course , before drawing more firm conclusions",
    "one should test the model also against the ( @xmath175 ) data and calculations in this direction are in progress . in this connection , it is interesting to note that a recent reanalysis of the ( @xmath175 ) world data @xcite seems to rule out the long - standing problem of the missing strength in the charge channel , which had been interpreted in terms of a quenching of the charge response .",
