    "<S> production of the neutral and doubly charged partners @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath2 as the charm - strange four - quark meson @xmath3 is studied in relation to observation of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that observation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in inclusive @xmath7 would be difficult , although @xmath1 might be observed in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> observations of @xmath0 and @xmath9 might be possible in hadronic @xmath10 decays .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the resonance @xmath4 , which decays into @xmath11 , has been observed in @xmath7 experiments  . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a resonance that is degenerate with it has been observed in @xmath10 decays  . </S>",
    "<S> while it is known that their spin - parity is @xmath12 and their width is very narrow , their isospin quantum number has not yet been definitively determined . </S>",
    "<S> ( a comprehensive review on new heavy mesons is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ) to determine the isospin quantum number of @xmath4 , its decay properties have been studied  @xcite by assigning it to various scalar meson states : ( i ) the @xmath13 component @xmath14 of iso - triplet four - quark mesons  , @xmath15[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=1}\\ , ( n = u,\\,d)$ ] ; ( ii ) the iso - singlet four - quark meson , @xmath16[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=0}$ ] , which might not be identical to that considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; ( iii ) the conventional scalar @xmath17 meson  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained in these studies are ( i ) @xmath18 , ( ii ) @xmath19 and ( iii ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . the same approach predicts  @xcite @xmath24 which reproduces well the measured ratio  @xcite , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and thus the present approach seems to be sufficiently reliable . by comparing the above results with the experimental constraint   @xmath27 it has been concluded that experiments favor the assignment ( i ) over ( ii ) and ( iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that its assignment to an iso - singlet @xmath28 molecule ,  @xcite as an additional possibility , has already been rejected ,  @xcite because it leads to the relation @xmath29 .    from the above considerations , we see that it is natural to assign @xmath4 to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , its neutral and doubly charged partners , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , have not yet been observed experimentally  @xcite . with this in mind , in this short note , we study the production of charm - strange scalar four - quark mesons ( @xmath30 and @xmath9 ) in relation to the observation of @xmath4 by assigning it to @xmath14 and discuss why experiments have observed @xmath4 but not its neutral and doubly charged partners . to this end , we consider their production through weak interactions as a possible mechanism , because ozi - rule violating productions of multiple @xmath31 pairs and their recombinations into four - quark meson states are believed to be strongly suppressed at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> ( such multiple @xmath31 pair creations might produce backgrounds of four - quark meson signals . ) </S>",
    "<S> first , we construct quark - line diagrams within the minimal ( i.e. , one ) @xmath31 pair creation , noting the ozi rule .     [ </S>",

    "<S> the latter involves rearrangements of colors , as in color mismatched decays , and is much more strongly suppressed than the color favored ones , as we see in the case of @xmath10 decays below . </S>",
