    "the understanding of methane emission and methane absorption plays a central role both in the atmosphere ( for troposphere see , e.g. , @xcite ) and on the surface of the earth ( see , e.g. , @xcite regarding the methane emissions from natural wetlands and references therein or @xcite for efficient and robust model of the methane emission from sedge - grass marsh in south bohemia ) .",
    "several important ecological processes , e.g. ebullition of methane and its natural microergodicity request better designs for observations in order to decrease variability in parameter estimation @xcite . in this context by a design we mean a set of locations where the investigated process is observed .",
    "thus , a crucial fact , before the measurements are taken , is to give an optimal design of the sites where observations should be collected .",
    "@xcite provided a comparison of filling and d - optimal designs for a one - dimensional design variable , e.g. , temperature .",
    "however , such a model oversimplifies the important fact that variation of other variables , e.g. , rates @xmath0 of the considered modified arrhenius model , could disturb the efficiency of the learning process .",
    "the latter statement is also in agreement with common sense in physical chemistry . in this paper",
    "the difficulties of modelling and design are treated , mainly by allowing an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) sheet error model .",
    "we concentrate on efficient estimation of the parameters of the modified arrhenius model ( model popular in chemical kinetics ) , which is used by @xcite as a flux model of methane in troposphere .",
    "this generalized exponential ( ge ) model can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are constants and @xmath4 is a random error term . in the case of correlated errors",
    "such a model was studied by @xcite , however , in that work error structures were univariate stochastic processes .",
    "for the case of uncorrelated errors see bayesian approach of @xcite and also the work of @xcite for different optimality criteria and restrictions on the design space . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the authors concentrated on the modified - arrhenius ( ma ) model , which is equivalent to the ge model through the change of variable @xmath5 .",
    "this model is useful for chemical kinetic ( mainly because it is a generalization of arrhenius model describing the influence of temperature @xmath6 on the rates of chemical processes , see , e.g. , @xcite for general discussion and @xcite for optimal designs ) .",
    "however , for specific setups , for instance , long temperature ranges , arrhenius model is insufficient and the modified arrhenius ( or ge model ) appears to be the good alternative ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "other applications of model in chemistry are related to the transition state theory ( tst ) of chemical reactions @xcite .    in practical chemical kinetics",
    "two steps are taken : first the rates @xmath0 are estimated ( typically with symmetric estimated error ) and then modified arrhenius model is fitted to the rates , i.e. , @xmath7 statistically correct would be to assess both steps by one optimal experimental planning .",
    "@xcite concentrated on the second phase , i.e. what is the optimal distribution of temperature for obtaining statistically efficient estimators of trend parameters @xmath8 and correlation parameters of the error term @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we provide designs both for rates and temperatures , and in this way substantially generalize the previously studied model .",
    "correlation is the natural dependence measure fitting for elliptically symmetric distributions ( e.g. , gaussian ) . by taking @xmath10 ( this variable can play , for example , the role of atmospheric pressure , latitude or location of the measuring balloon in troposphere , either vertically or horizontally ) and temperature @xmath6 to be variables of covariance",
    ", our model takes a form of a stationary process @xmath11 where the design points are taken from a compact design space @xmath12\\times [ a_2 , b_2]$ ] , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , is a stationary ou sheet , that is a zero mean gaussian process with covariance structure @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that @xmath18 can also be represented as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , is a standard brownian sheet @xcite .",
    "covariance structure implies that for @xmath21 , the variogram @xmath22 @xmath23 equals @xmath24 and the correlation between two measurements depends on the distance through the semivariogram @xmath25 .",
    "as can be visible from relation between rates and parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the modified arrhenius model , the second variable @xmath10 is missing from trend since it is not chemically understood as driving mechanism of chemical kinetics , however , in this context it is an environment variable .    in order to apply the usual notations of spatial modeling @xcite we introduce @xmath28 and",
    "instead of we investigate @xmath29 where @xmath30 is considered as a nuisance parameter .",
    "for discussion on the identifiability of the covariance parameters see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive several optimal design results for the case of constant trend and regular grids resulting in a kronecker product covariance structure .",
    "these theoretical contributions will serve as benchmarks for optimal designs in a methane flux model .",
    "thus we consider the stationary process @xmath31 with the design points taken from a compact design space @xmath12\\times [ a_2 , b_2]$ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is a stationary ornstein - uhlenbeck sheet , i.e. , a zero mean gaussian process with covariance structure ( [ oucovmod ] ) .      as a first step we derive d - optimal designs , that is arrangements of design points that maximize the objective function @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the fisher information matrix of observations of the random field @xmath34 .",
    "this method , `` plugged '' from the widely developed uncorrelated setup , is offering considerable potential for automatic implementation , although further development is needed before it can be applied routinely in practice .",
    "theoretical justifications of using the fisher information for d - optimal designing under correlation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we investigate grid designs of the form @xmath35\\times [ a_2 , b_2]$ ] , @xmath36 , and without loss of generality we may assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 . usually , the grid containing the design points can be arranged arbitrary in the design space @xmath39 , but we also consider restricted d - optimality , when @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. the vertices of @xmath42 are included in all designs .",
