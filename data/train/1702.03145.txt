    "<S> quantum phenomena are relevant to the transport of light atoms and molecules through nanoporous two - dimensional ( 2d ) membranes . indeed , confinement provided by ( sub-)nanometer pores enhances quantum effects such as tunneling and zero point energy ( zpe ) , even leading to quantum sieving of different isotopes of a given element . </S>",
    "<S> however , these features are not always taken into account in approaches where classical theories or approximate quantum models are preferred . in this work we present an exact three - dimensional wave packet propagation treatment for simulating the passage of atoms through periodic 2d membranes . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are reported for the transmission of @xmath0he and @xmath1he through graphdiyne as well as through a holey graphene model . for he - graphdiyne </S>",
    "<S> , estimations based on tunneling - corrected transition state theory are correct : both tunneling and zpe effects are very important but competition between each other leads to a moderately small @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , formulations that neglect one or another quantum effect are inappropriate . </S>",
    "<S> for the transport of he isotopes through leaky graphene , the computed transmission probabilities are highly structured suggesting widespread selective adsorption resonances and the resulting rate coefficients and selectivity ratios are not in agreement with predictions from transition state theory . </S>",
    "<S> present approach serves as a benchmark for studies of the range of validity of more approximate methods .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : quantum sieving , nanoporous two - dimensional materials , helium isotopes , graphdiyne , zero point energy , tunneling    recent progress in the fabrication of nanoporous two - dimensional ( 2d ) membranes has led to propose them as efficient sieves at the molecular level@xcite . particularly , it has been suggested that these membranes could be used for the separation of a specific isotope within an atomic or molecular gas@xcite , a process which is both important and challenging . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath0he is essential to several applications ranging from security to basic research but it is very rare and its growing demand is leading to an acute shortage of this species@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , separation of @xmath0he from the much more abundant @xmath1he -in turn , commonly extracted from natural gas- usually involves very expensive cryogenic methods . </S>",
    "<S> separation of the heavier isotopes of h@xmath2 is also crucial for various technologies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , single - layer membranes should involve a low energy consumption and efficiency , provided that the pores are designed to optimize the desired separation process .    for sufficiently low pressures </S>",
    "<S> , the study of purification of a gas mixture can be modeled by the dynamics of an atom or molecule passing through a pore of the 2d membrane . in this way , rate coefficients for the transmission of the isotopic species of the mixture , say @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are independently computed at a given temperature @xmath5 , and the efficiency for the isotope separation is estimated by means of the selectivity ratio @xmath6 . since isotopes are chemically identical , the separation mechanism must be provided by mass - dependent dynamical effects . at sufficiently low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , quantum effects may entail large selectivity ratios as compared with those based on classical diffusion , for instance . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a rather large number of works have shown that quantum tunneling might rule an efficient separation process@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these studies are based on one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum - mechanical calculations , whereas the molecular motion actually occurs in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) space where differences between the quantum energy levels of the isotopes confined within the pores can also lead to quantum sieving@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects , which may be generally termed as zero point energy ( zpe ) effects@xcite , have been invoked in various theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works on porous materials . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to emphasize that tunneling and zpe effects work in opposite directions : while tunneling favors the passage of lighter molecules , zpe increases the transmission of the heavier ones since their smaller zpe is associated to a smaller `` effective size '' . therefore , it is important to evaluate the relative role of each effect on the systems of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> we have recently studied@xcite the interplay between tunneling and zpe effects in the transmission of he isotopes through graphdiyne@xcite , a promising new material for molecular separation applications@xcite as it exhibits regularly distributed pores of sub - nanometer size . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we relied on transition state theory ( tst ) with especific inclusion of reaction - path tunneling corrections . </S>",
    "<S> he - graphdiyne interactions were represented by a force field validated from _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that , if only tunneling effects are considered ( ignoring zpe ) , @xmath0he transmission rate is larger than the @xmath1he one in the studied 20 - 100 k temperature range , reaching a selectivity factor of @xmath7 2.5 at 20 k. this result is similar to findings accomplished from 1d calculations on related systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complete theory , which also includes zpe effects , leads to a _ </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively _ different conclusion : transport becomes more probable for @xmath1he and at 20 k the selectivity ratio is also @xmath7 2.5 but this time favoring @xmath1he instead of @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> it became clear that the transmission of atoms through the membrane must be studied within a 3d model and that accurate quantum calculations may be needed in order to properly account for the delicate competition between the above mentioned quantum effects .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present an accurate quantum - mechanical formulation to study the transmission of an atom through a periodic 2d membrane , therefore going beyond tst . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved by propagating 3d wave packets and , from the calculation of the flux through a surface separating the incident and transmitted wave packets , transmission probabilities and rate coefficients are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent quantum - mechanical methods have been extensively applied to various collisional and photodissociation processes@xcite but , although one of their first applications was devoted to the scattering of atoms by surfaces@xcite , we are not aware of a generalization of this approach to the scattering by a porous membrane . </S>",
    "<S> present 3d wave packet method ( wp3d in short ) is applied to he - graphdiyne@xcite as well as to a holey graphene model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this work is to provide with a trustworthy method for the investigation of quantum phenomena in the transport of atoms through membranes , in this way allowing us the assessment of more approximate treatments . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that tst is reliable for he - graphdiyne but not for he - holey graphene . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it turns up that in addition to tunneling and zpe effects , selective adsorption resonances@xcite ( another genuine quantum feature ) can also play a role in these processes . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that this research will serve to uncover new clues for the design of optimal pores for quantum sieving .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper arranges as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first we give the theory for the transmission of a 3d wave packet through a periodic membrane , accompanied by a refresher outline of tst . </S>",
    "<S> results are presented and discussed first for he - graphdiyne , followed by he - holey graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the report ends with a conclusion paragraph .    </S>",
    "<S> _ theory . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the present wp3d approach we consider the scattering of an atom of mass @xmath8 by a periodic membrane by means of time - dependent 3d wave packet methods . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane coincides with the @xmath9 plane of the reference frame , whose origin is set at the center of one of its pores ; hence the position of the atom is given by @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the distance to the membrane plane and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet representing the atom is discretized on a grid of evenly spaced @xmath13 points and at the start of the propagation is given as a product of a gaussian wave packet@xcite in @xmath11 times a plane wave with wave vector @xmath14 in @xmath15 . thus , as in the original work by yinnon and kosloff@xcite , the periodicity of the system is fully exploited by matching the size of the ( @xmath16 grid to that of the unit cell , ( @xmath17 ) , while the values of the parallel wave vector @xmath14 are restricted such that the initial plane wave is commensurate with the membrane lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet is propagated in time subject to the time - dependent schdinger equation , using the split operator method@xcite , and is being absorbed in the asymptotic regions by means of a wave packet splitting algorithm@xcite . to obtain the probability of transmission of the atom through the membrane , its is convenient to write first the asymptotic behavior of the stationary wave function for a translational energy @xmath18 ,    @xmath19 } } { \\sqrt{k_{z , { \\bf g}}^+ } } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      & \\left . </S>",

    "<S> this function is normalized as @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the ( total ) transmission probability , which is the sum of the squared transmission amplitudes , can be also obtained from the flux of the stationary wave function through a surface @xmath27 separating transmitted from incident and reflected waves@xcite ,    @xmath28    we have employed this flux formula for computing @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is obtained from the time - energy fourier transform of the evolving wave packet@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the transmission rate coefficient is then obtained from the integration of @xmath31 , properly weighted by the boltzmann factor :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the translational partition function per unit volume . in detail , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 not only depends on the translational energy but it is also labeled by the parallel wave vector @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> a complete calculation of the rate coefficients should involve averaging over a sufficiently large set of @xmath14 values . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have used initial wave packets perpendicularly approaching the membrane ( * k*= * 0 * ) and postpone the investigation of effects due the different orientations of the incident wave .    </S>",
    "<S> computational details of the wp3d simulations are provided in the supporting information section .    </S>",
    "<S> rate coefficients computed in this way are compared with those obtained from tst as detailed in ref.@xcite . in short , it is assumed that the reaction path is a straight line perpendicular to the membrane and crossing the center of the pore , which is the ts . </S>",
    "<S> hence the transmission rate coefficient can be written as@xcite    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    is the ts partition function , @xmath36 being the energy levels of the bound states for the degrees of freedom perpendicular to the reaction path ( he in - plane vibrations inside the pore ) . </S>",

    "<S> briefly , the he - graphdiyne potential is obtained as a pairwise sum over he - c pair potentials , the latter being represented by an improved lennard - jones ( ilj ) formula@xcite whose parameters have been optimized from comparison with benchmark high level _ ab initio _ calculations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> graphdiyne unit cell is depicted in the right - upper panel of fig.[fig1new ] whereas in its left - lower panel a plot of the he - graphdiyne potential is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath44 is a saddle : whereas it corresponds to the maximum of a barrier potential along the `` reaction - path '' @xmath11 coordinate -with a height of @xmath45 36.92 mev- it is a minimum with respect to displacements along the @xmath46 and @xmath47 `` in - pore '' degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to note that while the potential barrier is rather low at this saddle point it rapidly rises for paths different to the minimum energy path .    </S>",

    "<S> in addition , it is worth noticing the small value of the probabilities above threshold : they are slightly lower ( higher ) than 0.03 for @xmath1he ( @xmath0he ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values can be related to the ratio between the effective size of the pores and the membrane area , i.e. , with the @xmath38 factor of eq.[gamma ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence the effective pore size ( @xmath40 ) can be estimated and it is found to be slightly lower ( higher ) than 1.2 @xmath48 for @xmath1he ( @xmath0he ) . finally , the behavior below threshold is shown in the inset of fig . </S>",

    "<S> this wp3d rate coefficient is compared with that previously reported within tst@xcite except that in this work we additionally include the correction given @xmath38 ( eqs . [ ktst ] and [ gamma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> to that end , we have computed @xmath40 from the ground state ts wave function , @xmath49 , as the region where @xmath50 is larger than a given cutoff , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath52 leads to @xmath53= 0.033 and 0.029 for @xmath0he and @xmath1he , respectively , a result that nicely matches the values of the probabilities mentioned above for the two isotopic species . with this choice wp3d and tst rate </S>",
    "<S> coefficients agree very well along the whole temperature range , except at the lowest temperatures where the wp3d coefficients are somewhat larger , probably due to an underestimation of tunneling from tst . for @xmath1he ( </S>",

    "<S> finally , the @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity ( ratio of rate coefficients ) is reported in the inset of fig.[fig2new].b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that there is a fairly good agreement between the wp3d and tst calculations , although below 40 k wp3d calculations show that the preference for the transport of the heavier isotope is not as significant as originally predicted by tst .    </S>",
    "<S> wp3d calculations confirm the conclusions previously drawn from the tst calculations@xcite : both tunneling and zero point energy are very important effects in the permeability of he at low temperatures but , as they operate in opposite directions , in the end we can not achieve a large difference between the transmission rates of the two isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that neglect of one or the other quantum effect in the model would have led to qualitatively erroneous results . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the very low values of the related rate coefficients ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2new].b ) ) suggest that the actual flux of these species through the sieve would be extremely slow . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that permeability usually decreases as selectivity increases@xcite . as a possible strategy for achieving isotope separation , </S>",
    "<S> new membranes could be designed where one of the two competing quantum effects are suppressed while the flux of the more permeable species is kept sufficiently large . with that aim </S>",
    "<S> , we report below results for a model system where tunneling is in principle absent .     </S>",

    "<S> et al_@xcite , where nanopores are generated by eliminating atoms from a graphene sheet and a simple lennard - jones pairwise interaction is assumed between he and all the carbon atoms of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> here we have chosen the same pairwise potential ( @xmath55 2.971  and well depth @xmath56 1.611 mev ) and a membrane where the pores are created by periodically removing seven rings from graphene . the unit cell of this membrane , which will be called `` p7 membrane '' , is depicted in fig.[fig3new].a ) . also in that figure the main features of the he - p7 interaction </S>",
    "<S> are compared with those of he - graphdiyne . on the one hand and in contrast with graphdiyne ( fig.[fig3new].b ) ) , </S>",
    "<S> there is not a potential barrier along the minimum energy path of he - p7 . on the other hand ( fig.[fig3new].c ) ) and now in similarity with the previous membrane , the difference between the zpes of @xmath1he and @xmath0he is considerable ( 4 mev ) . using tst arguments , one can expect a large @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity due to this difference as well as the suppression of tunneling which would favor @xmath0he . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as these ts energies are much lower than those of he - graphdiyne , we foresee that the transmission rates will be much larger in the present system .    </S>",

    "<S> p7 unit cell , including the tst effective area for @xmath0he transmission , are displayed in the upper - left inset . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity vs. temperature is presented in the lower - right inset.,width=311 ]    he - p7 transmission probabilities are presented in fig.[fig4new].a ) . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the probabilities rise at translational energies close to the tst prediction given by the ts ground state level ( 20 and 24 mev for @xmath1he and @xmath0he , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> however and in contrast to he - graphdiyne , probabilities exhibit a multitude of peaks along the whole energy range . we have checked that these structures are not due to any artifact in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these peaks correspond to selective adsorption resonances , a process that can be understood as a temporal trapping of the incident wave into a bound state of the laterally averaged potential while the motion along the parallel coordinates , ruled by the bragg condition , becomes faster for the sake of the conservation of energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the wave packet propagation supports this argument : it is noticed that after the main portion of the wave packet has been either reflected or transmitted by direct scattering , a non - negligible fraction of this wave packet remains trapped along the adsorption region ( @xmath7 3  ) for a long time while it is slowly decaying towards the reflection or the transmission regions . </S>",
    "<S> resonance structures are not seen in the he - graphdiyne transmission probabilities probably because they are extremely narrow . </S>",
    "<S> we plan to further study the role played by these resonances from simulations of the decaying of initially prepared adsorbed states@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> wp3d rate coefficients for @xmath0he - p7 as functions of temperature are reported in fig.[fig4new].b ) . comparing with graphdiyne ( fig.[fig2new].b ) ) , it is worth noticing their large absolute values which are due to the lower thresholds in the transmission probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> tst calculations have been also performed for this system to test whether this theory can predict the wp3d results . </S>",
    "<S> tst rate coefficients were obtained using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ ktst ] where , in this case , @xmath58 , as the minimum energy path is barrier - less . the @xmath38 factor has been computed , as for graphdiyne , from the ts ground state wave function and taking the same value for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are @xmath59= 0.0130 and 0.0144 for @xmath0he and @xmath1he , respectively , which are in fairly good agreement with the heights of the plateaus reached for the probabilities in the higher energy region ( fig.[fig4new].a ) ) . however , tst rate coefficients do not agree quite well with the wp3d calculations , especially at low temperatures where differences become of almost two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> tst also underestimates the rate coefficients of @xmath1he - p7 ( not shown ) although to a lesser extent . as a consequence , tst is unable to predict the qualitative behavior of the @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity ratio , reported in the inset of fig.[fig4new].b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , while tst predicts an increase of the @xmath1he/@xmath0he selectivity as temperature decreases ( reaching a promising value of six at 20 k ) , the accurate treatment gives a maximum of just 2.3 at about 23 k. tunneling along non minimum energy paths ( either direct or mediated by the resonances@xcite ) can be at the origin of the larger values of the wp3d rate coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that discrepancies are larger for the lighter isotope supports this argument . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it appears that tunneling still operates for this system and competes with zpe effects so that , after all , the quantum sieving is not as important as initially expected based on simpler theories .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion_. we have reported an accurate three - dimensional wave packet approach for the study of the passage of atoms through nanoporous one - atom - thick membranes . </S>",
    "<S> results of simulations of the transmission of he isotopes through graphdiyne and a leaky graphene model indicate the relevance of quantum effects such as tunneling , transition state zero point energy and , as a novelty , resonances . </S>",
    "<S> transition state theory is found to be successful for he - graphdiyne but fails for the holey graphene model . </S>",
    "<S> this approach can be used as a reference in studies of the range of validity of this and other approximate theories . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is possible to extend this method to more complex systems such as diatoms or bilayered membranes , for instance . </S>",
    "<S> we plan to work along some of these lines in the near future . </S>"
