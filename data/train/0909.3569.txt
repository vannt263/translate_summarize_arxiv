    "the effect of dust extinction on point - like objects , stars , is linearly related to extinction .",
    "if , for example , the observed magnitude of a star is @xmath6 and it suffers an extinction of @xmath7 , its intrinsic magnitude will be @xmath8 .",
    "extended objects , like galaxies , suffer a further dimming due to the loss of their fainter outer regions in the sky background .",
    "an obscured galaxy appears smaller and fainter in the sky than it really is .",
    "corrections for this extra dimming are non - linear as was shown by and @xcite in the optical .",
    "@xcite derived corrections to the @xmath0 band isophotal magnitudes .",
    "their extinction correction study was initiated to correct the isophotal magnitudes for galaxies observed in the vicinity of the giant radio galaxy pks 1343 - 601 centred at @xmath9 .",
    "the average extinction in their region was @xmath10 . from their study",
    "they showed that the isophotal magnitude correction can be approximated by a linear relation for extinction levels @xmath11 .",
    "their work also showed that the different morphological types of galaxies are affected differently by extinction .",
    "galaxies that have an exponential light profile bulge ( late type ) need larger corrections than those with a de  vaucouleurs profile ( early type ) , or those with a bulge+disk light profile",
    ".    statistical results and conclusions derived from magnitude - limited and radius - limited galaxy catalogues are unreliable if they are not corrected for these extinction effects . applying extinction corrections to galaxy catalogues like the 2mass extended source catalog ( 2masx )",
    "@xcite will imply fainter completeness magnitudes than the currently quoted values . applying extinction corrections to optical catalogues for galaxies observed in the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) helped reduce the optical zoa from the region with extinction @xmath12 , to the region with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this reduction was a result of including those galaxies that did not make it into the diameter limited catalogues if they were not corrected for extinction .",
    "extinction magnitude corrections are crucial when relating spiral galaxy magnitudes to their velocity width for the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation",
    ". the here derived nir extinction corrections will prove invaluable for e.g. the ongoing whole - sky 2mass tully fisher survey @xcite , especially for galaxies found in the zoa .",
    "application of nir magnitude extinction corrections will also improve photometric redshift estimations @xcite for galaxies that are observed in the zoa .    motivated by an ongoing nir imaging survey to map the crossing of the great attractor wall across the zoa where extinction levels are severe , we initiated a study of the effect of galactic extinction on galaxies imaged in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "this will allow us to correct their observed isophotal - radii and magnitudes for extinction . in our current zoa survey along the norma wall ( riad et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we noticed , that @xmath17 of the galaxies in our sample were found in regions with an extinction @xmath18 , while @xmath19 were found in regions with an extinction @xmath20 .",
    "only @xmath21 of the galaxies were found in regions with an extinction @xmath22 .",
    "for the @xmath4 and @xmath0 band @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively of the galaxies were found in regions with @xmath25 , while @xmath26 and @xmath21 of the galaxies were obscured by @xmath27 .",
    "only a handfull of the galaxies were found in regions with @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore limited the simulation to the extinction range @xmath29 . in this work and for the purpose of estimating the extinction suffered by galaxies in our zoa survey we used the general extinction law , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the colour reddening derived from the @xcite reddening maps and @xmath32 is the extinction in the optical @xmath33 band .",
    "a typical value for @xmath34 is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "extinction in the nir @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 passbands was derived using the parametrization given by @xcite , see eqs .",
    "[ extj ] - [ extk ] .",
    "@xmath36    in this paper , we derive nir corrections to isophotal magnitudes and radii for galaxies obscured by the milky way .",
    "section 2 describes the data set and method .",
    "we describe two methods to apply the corrections ( sects .",
    "2.2 and 2.3 ) . in sect .",
    "3 we provide a brief comparison between the different methods , and discuss their respective reliability .",
    "we selected 64 galaxies from the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( lga ) @xcite to simulate the effect of extinction on isophotal - radii and magnitude for galaxies observed in the nir .",
    "2mass is an all - sky nir survey in the bands @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "galaxies were selected in such a way that they are minimally affected by contamination from neighbouring sources , and give a fair representation of all morphological types .",
    "the sample includes 25 elliptical and lenticular ( * e / s0 * ) , and 39 spiral ( * s * ) galaxies .",
    "half of the galaxies in the spiral galaxy sample are barred with some of them having ring features .",
    "the selected galaxies cover a wide range in galaxy size and brightness . the apparent radii range between @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the isophotal radius at the surface brightness level @xmath42 mag / arcsec@xmath43 .",
    "the apparent isophotal magnitude range covered by our sample is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the integrated magnitude within @xmath41 .",
    "the galaxies in our sample suffered minimal obscuration ranging between @xmath46 , see last column in table [ tgalaxies ] .",
    "the list of selected galaxies is given in table [ tgalaxies ] .",
    "this table lists the most common name of the galaxy , followed by the morphological type , @xmath41 , @xmath45 , inclination @xmath47 and position angle ( pa ) in the @xmath0 band .",

    "we also give the disk central surface brightness @xmath5 @xcite and the central surface brightness @xmath48 in the @xmath0 band .",
    "the last column lists the mean extinction @xmath49 .",
    "extinction in the @xmath0 band was derived from the @xcite reddening maps and eqn .",
    "the surface brightness profiles for the galaxies are taken from the lga ( given in tabular format ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the table lists the extra dimming and the radii reduction as estimated by the average corrections",
    ". it also lists the systematic shift @xmath50 for comparing the simulated correction and the average correction with the respective @xmath51 .",
    "the positive systematic shifts indicate that the average correction under estimate the extinction correction .",
    "we present two methods to correct galaxies for extinction in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "the optimized correction methods are more accurate than the average correction .",
    "however the average correction method is more straightforward to apply as it requires no knowledge of the light profile of the galaxy but only the classification of galaxies as early or late types .",
    "the extinction corrections that we present here are considered as a nir extension to those for the @xmath2 band derived before by @xcite .",
    "these corrections will be invaluable to the analysis of large scale structures in the ongoing nir galaxy survey along the norma wall in the zoa .",
    "it will also be applicable to other galaxy surveys e.g. 2masx or prospective eso galaxy surveys e.g. vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy survey ( viking ) using the vista telescope .",
