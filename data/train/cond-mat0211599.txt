    "in a statistical system quenched from the random disordered state to a low - temperature state below the transition temperature , the average length scale @xmath4 of ordered domains typically grows in time as a power law @xmath5 , where the growth exponent @xmath6 depends on the dimension of the space and of the relevant order parameter , in addition to the conserved or nonconserved nature of the latter in the relaxation dynamics.@xcite depending crucially on the dimension of the order parameter , characteristic topological defects such as point vortices or domain walls are generated in the initial disordered state and the annihilation of these defects gives the main mechanism of coarsening and phase ordering in the system .",
    "the observed self - similarity of these coarsening systems at different time instants , is embodied in the so - called _ dynamic scaling hypothesis _ of the equal - time spatial correlation function of the order parameter .",
    "one of the extensively studied cases is the system with the order parameter dimension @xmath7 in two spatial dimensions @xmath8 , i.e. , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) _ xy _ model , where the relevant topological defect is the point vortex.@xcite a convenient physical realization of the 2d _ xy _ model can be found in the 2d regular arrays of superconducting josephson junctions , where the phases of the superconducting order parameters correspond to the @xmath9 spins . in such a superconducting array , frustration may be induced simply by applying an external magnetic field.@xcite it affects thermodynamic properties in a crucial way , leading to a variety of phase transitions.@xcite    in view of the remarkable diversity in the equilibrium properties , also expected for the system are a variety of interesting dynamic behaviors , particularly in relaxation toward equilibrium .",
    "the quasi - long - range order present in the 2d pure @xmath9 model,@xcite describing the array without frustration ( i.e. , in the absence of a magnetic field ) , is expected to exhibit coarsening through annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs , giving rise to characteristic algebraic relaxation .",
    "the vortex dynamics and the resulting scaling behavior in the 2d @xmath9 model has been an issue for some time , concerning late - time scaling and true nature of the asymptotic growth law .",
    "it is also of interest to examine the effects of the additional long - range order on the relaxation in the fully frustrated array ( with half the flux quantum per plaquette),@xcite where the relaxation dynamics is expected to be dominated by coarsening processes accompanying decay of domain walls and also point defects ; the latter corresponds to the corners on the domain walls .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to probe the properties of the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics associated with coarsening processes in the unfrustrated and fully frustrated superconducting arrays under rapid quenching from the high - temperature disordered state to the low - temperature ordered or quasi - ordered states .",
    "we would like to understand what kind of specific features emerge in the relaxation dynamics of these systems governed by the resistively - shunted - junction ( rsj ) dynamic equations , especially in connection with the coarsening processes .",
    "the time - dependent behaviors of various one - time and two - time correlations involving energy and order parameters such as vortex density and chirality are investigated numerically .    in the case of an unfrustrated array , we argue that the friction constant of a slow moving vortex remains finite in the limit of large extent of the vortex;@xcite this leads ( via a simple force - velocity relation ) to a power - law growth of length scales with growth exponent @xmath10 , together with the excess number of vortices decaying as @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "extensive simulations indeed show that @xmath13 takes a value that is very close to unity in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "this is in contrast to the simulation results of the ordinary phase ordering process based on either monte carlo algorithms or _",
    "simple langevin dynamics _ of the @xmath9 model ( see section iii for details ) , where a logarithmic correction factor is observed in the time dependence of the growing length scale .",

    "@xcite performed dynamic simulations on the fully frustrated @xmath9 models , based on the simple langevin equations for _ xy _ phase angles .",
    "it was shown that the domain growth exponents are temperature - dependent and that there exist two regimes of domain - growth morphology . later , coarsening was also studied in the dual representation , i.e. , the lattice coulomb gas of fractional vortices , through the use of monte carlo methods on the vortex degrees of freedom.@xcite the latter work , even though based on different dynamics , confirmed most features of the previous results and gave some numerical evidence for unbinding of the so - called single - step kinks at a finite temperature .",
    "those rich features of coarsening in the fully frustrated @xmath9 model can be partly attributed to the existence of the ising - like chiral degrees of freedom in addition to the underlying phase degrees of freedom . here , in this work , we perform dynamic simulations on the coarsening of the fully frustrated josephson - junction arrays , governed by the rsj equations , and examine whether temperature - dependent coarsening also emerges .",
    "it is found that , similarly to the previous works , the domain growth exponents are strongly temperature - dependent : the exponents are proportional to the temperature in the low - temperature limit and increase monotonically with the temperature .",
    "we begin with the set of equations of motion for the phases @xmath14 of the superconducting order parameters in an @xmath15 square array . in the rsj model with the fluctuating twist boundary conditions,@xcite they read : @xmath16=0 , \\ ] ] where we have employed the abbreviations @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the primed summation runs over the nearest neighbors of grain @xmath19 .",

    "it is well known that the unfrustrated system ( @xmath63 ) , described by the _",
    "xy _ model in equilibrium , is critical below the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath64.@xcite previous works on relaxation of the @xmath9 model dealt mostly with the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations ( either the soft - spin version or the hard - spin version ) .",
    "the hard - spin version , where the magnitude of each spin is fixed , is described by the _",
    "langevin equations for phases : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hamiltonian and the noise @xmath67 satisfies @xmath68 .",
    "experimentally , this _ simple _ langevin dynamics corresponds to the situation where dissipation through the resistance between superconducting islands and the substrate dominates over those through the junction resistance .    in this model with no frustration , it was argued that the friction constant @xmath69 of a slow moving vortex depends logarithmically on the size ( spatial extent ) @xmath70 of the vortex , i.e. , @xmath71 , where the cutoff length scale @xmath72 may be taken as the size of the vortex core.@xcite combining this result with the coulomb force law of @xmath73 , we get the relation @xmath74 , which leads to the conclusion that the time dependence of the vortex number exhibits logarithmic correction to the power law : @xmath75 . the typical length scale , e.g. , the separation between vortices , is then expected to follow @xcite @xmath76 .",
    "numerical confirmation of this prediction has turned out rather tricky and subtle.@xcite    here , we apply a similar argument to the coupled rsj dynamics of the superconducting arrays .",
    "interestingly , the mobility of a vortex whose motion is governed by the rsj dynamics is found not to vanish in the large - separation limit ( @xmath77 ) but to remain finite .",
    "this can be easily seen from the following argument based on the equations of motion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) for the phase variables . equation  ( [ eq : dyn1 ] ) can be rewritten in the following form @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the discrete laplacian matrix and the hamiltonian @xmath80 is given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : friction ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dissipation ] ) , it has been noted that in the continuum limit , the discrete laplacian matrix @xmath79 turns into @xmath90 and the time derivative becomes velocity multiplied by the spatial derivative with respect to @xmath82 for the ansatz vortex configuration . in the limit of zero vortex velocity ( @xmath91 )",
    ", one can easily see from dimensional argument that the mobility becomes finite for a vortex of an infinite extent .",
    "namely , the above integral for @xmath92 is convergent in the large - size limit , owing to the presence of the additional laplacian derivative term @xmath90 .",
    "since we have @xmath93 for a single isolated vortex , the integrand in the above equation goes as @xmath94 , which is infrared convergent in two dimensions .",
    "( a )    ( b )    since the friction constant converges quickly to a finite value @xmath95 as the extent of the vortex is increased , the equation of motion resulting from the force balance reads @xmath96 from which one can estimate the annihilation time for a vortex - antivortex pair of size @xmath97 to be @xmath98 , with the cutoff length scale @xmath99 corresponding to the size of the vortex core . this can be interpreted as the growth law for the typical ( average ) separation between vortices as @xmath100 , which in turn leads to the vortex number @xmath101 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xy](a ) shows the relaxation of the number of vortices at temperatures @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "observed in the late - time regime are good fits with @xmath104 and @xmath105 at @xmath106 and at @xmath102 , respectively , in excellent agreement with the expected @xmath107 behavior .",
    "this result may be used to obtain the energy relaxation behavior : on the basis of the dynamic scaling hypothesis and the porod law,@xcite which refers to the power - law singularity in the short ( scaled ) distance limit of the equal - time spatial correlation function due to the presence of topological defects , it is known that the excess energy for the @xmath108 model with @xmath7 scales as @xcite @xmath109 where the typical length scale may be taken to be separation between vortices ( @xmath110 ) and the cutoff to be the vortex core size ( @xmath111 ) in our system . noting the simulation result @xmath112 presented above",

    "such a value which is smaller than unity can be understood as coming from the logarithmic factor .",

    "critical dynamic scaling has been attempted with various values of @xmath60 : for each trial value of @xmath60 , the rescaled function @xmath124 has been plotted in terms of the rescaled distance @xmath125 , where the length scale @xmath126 as a function of time @xmath48 has been obtained from the condition @xmath127 .",

    "we have also performed simulations at various temperatures , and found that the value of @xmath132 is nearly constant , showing only small variations in the range @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",
    "the reason behind this small but apparently systematic deviation is not clear at this stage .",
    "presumably , it is related to the fact that we are working with a lattice system where small local barriers exist for the motion of point vortices . at the early - time stage when the vortices are close together , these barriers are negligible compared with inter - vortex forces ; at the late - time stage when vortices are far away , local energy barriers are likely to hinder appreciably the vortex motion , possibly resulting in smaller values of the effective growth exponent .",
    "we now consider the fully frustrated array ( @xmath135 ) with the gauge field : @xmath136 which corresponds to the system of @xmath9 spins with one antiferromagnetic coupling per plaquette .",
    "the fully frustrated array has the discrete z@xmath137 symmetry in addition to the underlying u(1 ) symmetry , yielding the antiferromagnetic long - range order in the chirality at temperatures @xmath138.@xcite due to the existence of the chirality order parameter , the coarsening dynamics in a fully frustrated array proceeds in a manner quite different from that of the unfrustrated array .",
    "in order to probe nonequilibrium coarsening of a fully frustrated array , we measure the equal - time spatial correlations of the phase and the chirality .",
    "the phase correlation function in the fully frustrated array can be defined in the same way as eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin_eqtc ] ) for the unfrustrated array , only if it is assumed that the correlations are measured only for even lattice spacings along both the axes . restricting the position vectors to those with components of even lattice spacings corresponds to forming a superlattice , each plaquette of which consists of four plaquettes of the original lattice .",
    "such a superlattice system yields a ferromagnetic ground state within itself at zero temperature .",
    "meanwhile , the chirality correlation function is defined as follows : @xmath139 where the chirality @xmath140 , \\ ] ] with @xmath141 denoting the directional plaquette summation of links around dual lattice site @xmath142 , describes the degrees of freedom associated with the z@xmath137 symmetry . the factor @xmath143 , in the definition of @xmath144 , where @xmath145 , takes care of the _ staggered _ nature of the chirality ordering . due to the existence of these two kinds of degrees of freedom , the relaxation and ordering process proceeds via annihilation of two kinds of defects i.e. , point defects ( tending to restore the u(1 ) symmetry ) and line defects ( domain walls tending to restore the chiral @xmath146 symmetry ) .",
    "point defects correspond to the corners of line defects where fractional charges of magnitude @xmath147 reside.@xcite hence the annihilation processes of these two kinds of defects are closely coupled with each other .",
    "note that conventional point vortices with integer charges , possessing high energies , are annihilated very quickly in the early stage of coarsening ; thus they are irrelevant in the late - time coarsening behavior of the system .    here",
    "we present our simulation results for the ordering dynamics of only the chirality since the phase ordering exhibits similar features except for the additional @xmath60 exponent due to the criticality .",
    "figure  [ fig : ffxy_coarse ] shows the equal - time correlation function @xmath144 of the ( staggered ) chirality at temperature @xmath148 .",
    "spatial behavior of @xmath144 is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_coarse](a ) at various time stages @xmath149 to @xmath123 .",
    "scaling of the correlations can be obtained similarly to the case of the unfrustrated array , except for the obvious fact that @xmath150 , reflecting the emergence of true long - range order . the resulting nice scaling collapse is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_coarse](b ) .",
    "the scaling length @xmath151 is plotted versus time in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_coarse](c ) at various temperatures , from which one obtains the relation @xmath152 with the appropriate growth exponent @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the unfrustrated array , the growth exponent in the fully frustrated array depends strongly on the temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_coarse](d ) . for example",
    ", we have the value @xmath153 at temperature @xmath154",
    "but it decreases to @xmath155 at @xmath148 . at low temperatures , in particular",
    ", @xmath3 depends almost linearly on the temperature , which has also been observed in the ordering dynamics of the fully frustrated _",
    "xy _ model based on the simple langevin equation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the temperature dependence of the domain growth emerges only after some time ( @xmath156 ) ; before that time ( @xmath157 ) the domain growth apparently does not change with the temperature .",
    "such temperature independence at the early - time stage is a distinctive feature that is not found in the simple langevin dynamics .",
    "this indicates that dissipation at the early - time stage is dominated by a mechanism that is different from the temperature - dependent activation dynamics operating at the late - time stage .    in order to help understand the temperature - dependence of the dynamic exponent , we have also examined how ordering proceeds with time . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_conf ] are the snapshots at various time instants of ordering configurations in terms of the staggered chirality .",
    "figure  [ fig : ffxy_conf ] ( a ) and ( b ) exhibit the ordering process for quenching to low temperatures ( @xmath158 ) while ( c ) and ( d ) to higher temperatures ( @xmath159 ) , where black and white regions represent domains with opposite ( staggered ) chirality ordering .",
    "one can observe distinctive features in the domain growth morphology in the two cases : at low temperatures , typical separation between consecutive corner defects along a domain wall grows larger in time . at higher temperatures , in contrast , the typical separation between corners remains more or less constant throughout the ordering process .",
    "slow ordering at low temperatures ( @xmath158 ) compared with that at high temperatures ( @xmath159 ) can also be observed here , in agreement with the apparent temperature - dependence of @xmath160 obtained from the scaling analysis of the chirality correlation function .",
    "the above morphological characteristics are related to the time dependence of the number @xmath161 of point defects and of the total length @xmath162 of line defects .",
    "simulations reveal power - law relaxation toward equilibrium with temperature - dependent exponents , as shown fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_defect](a ) to ( c ) .",
    "namely , we have @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the values in equilibrium . these equilibrium values , which depend on the temperature , can easily be obtained from dynamic simulations , beginning with one of the the known ground state configurations .",
    "the resulting equilibrium values are negligibly small at low temperatures ( @xmath167 ) and the total amounts @xmath168 and @xmath162 as well as the excess amounts @xmath169 and @xmath170 display power - law decay . the corresponding decay exponents together with @xmath160 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffxy_defect](d ) as functions of the temperature . at low temperatures , we have @xmath171 and point defects decay away faster than line defects , resulting in growing separation between corner defects along domain walls . at higher temperatures , on the other hand , we have @xmath172 , and the average distance between neighboring point defects along a line defect does not change appreciably with time , similarly to the previous works@xcite , which argued , based on such numerical results , that there exists a roughening transition at a finite temperature .",
    "however , it was argued in a recent work that due to the finite excitation energy for the double - step kinks , the domain walls should be rough at any finite temperature.@xcite if this is indeed the case , asymptotic decay exponents for the domain walls and corner charges should be the same at all finite temperatures .",
    "unfortunately , numerical confirmation of this would be very formidable due to the slow domain growth at low temperatures .",
    "we have studied the non - equilibrium relaxation and coarsening dynamics of two - dimensional superconducting arrays in the overdamped limit under zero external driving current . in the case of unfrustrated arrays ,",
    "we find that the friction constant of a vortex remains finite in the limit of large extent of the vortex ; this is argued to lead to the absence of logarithmic factors in the length scale and in the vortex number decay , which is in reasonable agreement with simulation results . in the case of fully frustrated arrays , relaxation and coarsening dynamics are characterized by decay of line defects ( chirality domain walls ) as well as of point defects ( corner charges ) . here strong temperature dependence is found in the characteristics of the late - time domain growth , which can be explained by activated domain wall dynamics across the energy barriers with logarithmic size dependence . in the early - time regime , on the other handr , there exists a relatively long period of transient dynamics which is independent of the temperature ; this may be attributed to the effects of initial random distributions of the strong lorentz force , making the thermal noise irrelevant .",
