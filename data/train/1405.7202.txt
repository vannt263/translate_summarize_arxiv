    "also widely accepted is that it was a piece of a larger object and that additional fragments may be following similar orbits ( borovika et al .",

    "<S> the chelyabinsk superbolide was the largest known natural object to enter the earth s atmosphere since the tunguska event in 1908 and it has become a template to understand , manage and mitigate future impacts . although the event has been documented in great detail , the actual pre - impact orbit of the parent body is still controversial . here , we revisit this topic using an improved monte carlo approach that includes the coordinates of the impact point to compute the most probable solution for the pre - impact orbit ( @xmath0  =  1.62 au , @xmath1  =  0.53 , @xmath2  =  3@xmath397 , @xmath4  =  326@xmath345 and @xmath5  =  109@xmath371 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also check all the published solutions using a simple yet robust statistical test to show that many of them have problems to cause an impact at the right time . </S>",
    "<S> we use the improved orbit and @xmath6-body simulations to revisit the dynamical status of a putative chelyabinsk asteroid family and confirm that it could be linked to resonant asteroids 2007 bd@xmath7 and 2011  eo@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , and as the classification of chelyabinsk meteorites is well established , a search for meteorite falls of the same chondrite group and petrologic type gives some evidence for the existence of an associated ll5 chondrite cluster .    </S>",
