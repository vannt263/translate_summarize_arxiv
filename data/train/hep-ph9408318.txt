    "interest in the low @xmath1 , low @xmath2 phenomena in the inelastic lepton ",
    "hadron scattering is connected with experimental constraints that the low @xmath2 region in the present fixed target experiments can only be reached on the expense of lowering the @xmath1 values down to 1 gev@xmath6 or less ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "unified treatment of small- and large @xmath1 regions might also be of high practical importance for large @xmath1 data analysis .",
    "this stems from the fact that in all leptoproduction experiments , including those at hera , a radiative corrections procedure has to be applied in order to extract the structure functions from the data .",
    "the radiative `` tails '' originating from processes at @xmath1 values from the interval @xmath7 contribute to measurements at @xmath8 and the knowledge of the structure functions in this @xmath1 interval is necessary for the iterative data unfolding procedure @xcite .",
    "remembering that due to the conservation of the electromagnetic current the structure function @xmath0 must vanish in the limit @xmath9 , the bjorken scaling which holds approximately at high @xmath1 can not be a valid concept at low @xmath1 .",
    "theoretical models assuring a smooth transition from the scaling to non - scaling regions and applicable in a wide @xmath1 interval are thus necessary for understanding the experimental data and the underlying dynamics .",
    "the continuity of the physical processes occuring when passing from low- to high @xmath1 is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "we shall be predominantly concerned with the region of low @xmath1 and high @xmath10 , i.e. beyond the resonances .",
    "the need for modifying the qcd improved parton model by including contributions to the structure functions behaving as @xmath11 is clearly visible in the data @xcite .",
    "these contributions , called `` higher twists '' are important at moderate values of @xmath121 gev@xmath6 ) .",
    "they follow from the operator product expansion @xcite and describe effects of the struck parton s interaction with target remnants thus reflecting confinement effects . clearly the theoretical description unifying the confinement and deep inelastic regions should contain terms of well defined physical origin , corresponding to such contributions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to collect the existing knowledge about the region of low @xmath1 , low @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath1 below 3 gev@xmath6 and @xmath2 below 0.03 or so ) in a way which could at the same time make it easy to use in practical applications .",
    "the paper should be considered as an extension of the comprehensive review of the small @xmath2 physics @xcite towards the more detailed treatment of the low @xmath1 problems .",
    "we shall be exclusively concerned with * charged * lepton inelastic scattering .",
    "the recent review of problems specific for inelastic neutrino ( and antineutrino ) interactions is presented in the ref .",
    "it is predominantly the structure function @xmath0 which will be discussed ; particular final state structures , like jets , diffractive dissociation , etc .",
    "will not be considered .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows .",
    "after basic definitions and constraints ( section 2 ) we present theoretical ideas and models which describe the low @xmath1 physics ( section 3 ) .",
    "high energy photoproduction ( section 4 ) is then followed by a description of phenomenological parametrisations of structure functions ( section 5 ) .",
    "special attention is given to dynamical models of a low @xmath1 behaviour of @xmath0 ( section 6 ) .",
    "nuclear shadowing is described in section 7 and finally an update of experimental data is given in section 8 .",
    "section 9 contains conclusions and outlook .",
    "kinematics of inelastic charged lepton scattering is defined in fig.2 .",
    "one photon exchange approximation is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the imaginary part of the forward compton scattering amplitude of the virtual photon is defined by the tensor @xmath13(see e.g.@xcite ) : @xmath14 in this equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the square of the four - momentum transfer , @xmath17 the bjorken scaling variable and m is taken as the proton mass .",
    "the invariant quantity @xmath18 is related to the energy transfer @xmath19 in the target rest frame , @xmath20 .",
    "the invariant mass of the electroproduced hadronic system , @xmath10 , is then @xmath21 .",
    "often one denotes @xmath22 .",
    "the deep inelastic regime is defined as a region where both @xmath1 and @xmath23 are large and their ratio , @xmath2 , is kept fixed . at @xmath1 smaller than few gev@xmath6 , @xmath2 can probably no longer be interpreted as a momentum of a struck parton but it remains a convenient variable for displaying the data .",
    "the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the structure functions of the target .",
    "for a nuclear target it will be assumed that the structure functions are normalised to the number of nucleons in the target nucleus and denoted @xmath26 , @xmath271,2 ( except for the deuteron where a symbol @xmath28 will be used ) .",
    "the tensor @xmath13 satisfies the current conservation constraints : @xmath29 this follows from the fact that @xmath13 is related to the matrix element of the product of the electromagnetic current operators @xmath30 : @xmath31 where the symbol @xmath32 denotes time ordering .",
    "let us rearrange eq.([wmunu ] ) in order to display explicitly the potential kinematical singularities of the tensor @xmath13 at @xmath3 : @xmath33 these singularities can not be real and appear only as artifacts of the way we wrote up @xmath13 . in order to eliminate them we have to impose the following conditions on the structure functions @xmath34 in the limit @xmath9 : @xmath35 @xmath36 these conditions have to be fulfilled for arbitrary @xmath19 .",
    "they will play important role for the parametrisations of the structure functions at low @xmath1 .",
    "the differential electroproduction cross section is expressed in the following way by the structure functions @xmath34 : @xmath37 \\label{d2sig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes the energy of the incident lepton in the target rest frame , @xmath39 is the electron ( muon ) mass , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .    instead of @xmath42 the structure function",
    "@xmath43 defined as @xmath44 is often used where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the cross sections for the longitudinally and transversally polarised virtual photons respectively .",
    "the differential cross section ( [ d2sig ] ) then reads @xmath47 \\label{d2sigr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] real photons are only transversally polarised and therefore @xmath45 and @xmath48 vanish when @xmath49 .",
    "this vanishing follows from eqs ( [ f20 ] ) and ( [ f120 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath48 is related to the frequently used longitudinal structure function @xmath50 via @xmath51 , and @xmath52 at large @xmath1 , @xmath53 is directly sensitive to the gluon distribution function , which plays a crucial role in the interactions at small @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "in the leading log@xmath1 approximation of perturbative qcd which is applicable in the high @xmath1 region the structure function @xmath25 is directly related to the quark- and antiquark momentum distributions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 \\label{f2pm}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes quark flavours and @xmath58 are the quark charges . at high @xmath1 the quark and antiquark distributions exhibit the approximate bjorken scaling mildly violated by the qcd logarithmic corrections .",
    "the evolution of these distributions with @xmath1 is described by the altarelli - parisi equations @xcite .",
    "these equations as well as the relation ( [ f2pm ] ) acquire corrections proportional to @xmath59 in the next - to - leading log@xmath1 approximation .    systematic analysis of the structure functions in the bjorken limit can be done using the operator product expansion of the electromagnetic currents ( cf .",
    ". [ tprod ] ) , @xcite .",
    "this expansion leads to the expansion of the structure functions in the inverse powers of @xmath1 : @xmath60 where the functions @xmath61 depend weakly ( i.e. logarithmically ) on @xmath1 .",
    "various terms in this expansion are referred to as leading ( @xmath62 ) and higher ( @xmath63 ) twists .",
    "the `` twist '' number is defined in such a way that the leading one is equal to two and higher ones correspond to consecutive even integers .",
    "thus the right hand side of the equation ( [ f2pm ] ) with approximate bjorken scaling of quark distributions corresponds to the `` leading twist '' contribution to the @xmath0 . for moderately large values of @xmath1 ( @xmath1 of the order of a few gev@xmath6 ) contributions of the `` higher twists '' may become significant .",
    "contrary to the common opinion the higher twists are only corrections to the leading ( approximately scaling ) term ( [ f2pm ] ) in the large @xmath1 region .",
    "thus they can not correctly describe the low @xmath1 ( i.e. nonperturbative ) region since the expansion ( [ ht ] ) gives a divergent series there .",
    "in particular it should be noted that the individual terms in this expansion violate the constraint ( [ f20 ] ) . in order to correctly describe this region",
    "the ( formal ) expansion has to be summed beforehand , at large @xmath1 , and then continued to the region of @xmath64 .",
    "this is automatically provided by certain models like the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model . to be precise the vmd model together with its generalisation which gives ( approximate ) scaling at large @xmath1",
    "can be represented in a form ( [ ht ] ) for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "the vmd model is a quantitative realisation of the experimental fact that the photon interactions are often similar to these of a hadron @xcite .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 is in this model represented by : @xmath65 & = & { q^{2}\\over 4\\pi } \\sum^{}_{v }   { m^{4}_{v}\\sigma_{v}(s)\\over \\gamma^{2}_{v } ( q^{2 } + m^{2}_{v})^{2 } } \\label{vmd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath66 are the vector meson  nucleon total cross sections , @xmath67 is the mass of the vector meson @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be related in the standard way to the leptonic width of the @xmath68 @xcite : @xmath70 if only the finite number of vector mesons is included in the sum ( [ vmd ] ) then the @xmath0 vanishes as @xmath71 at large @xmath1",
    ". therefore it does not contain the `` leading twist '' term .",
    "the scaling can be introduced by including the infinite number of vector mesons in the sum .",
    "this version of the vmd is called the generalised vector meson dominance ( gvmd ) model @xcite .",
    "the heavy mesons contribution is directly related to the structure function in the scaling region .    in practical applications to the analysis of experimental data which extend to the moderate values of @xmath1 one often includes the higher twists corrections in the following simplified way : @xmath72 \\label{f2ht}\\ ] ] where the @xmath73 is the leading twist contribution to @xmath0 and @xmath74 is determined from fit to the data .",
    "this simple minded expression may not be justified theoretically since in principle the higher twist terms , i.e. functions @xmath61 for @xmath75 in eq.([ht ] ) evolve differently with @xmath1 than the leading twist term .    at high energies the regge theory @xcite is often used to parametrise the cross sections as the functions of energy @xmath10 .",
    "the high energy behaviour of the total cross sections is then given by the following expression : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the intercepts of the regge poles and @xmath78 denote their couplings .",
    "the intercepts @xmath77 are the universal quantities , i.e. they are independent of the external particles or currents and depend only on the quantum numbers of the regge poles which are exchanged in the crossed channel .",
    "the regge pole exchange is to a large extent a generalisation of the particle exchange and formally describes a pole of the partial wave amplitude in the crossed channel in the complex angular momentum plane .",
    "the regge pole corresponding to the vacuum quantum numbers is called pomeron .",
    "it is expected to have the highest intercept , close to unity .",
    "it is a phenomenologically established fact that the energy dependence of the total hadronic and photoproduction cross sections can be described by two contributions : the ( effective ) pomeron with intercept @xmath79=1.08 and the reggeon with the intercept @xmath80 close to 0.5 @xcite . since bulk of the cross sections comes from the `` soft '' processes one usually refers to the phenomenological pomeron having its intercept slightly above unity as the `` soft '' pomeron . on the other hand in the leading logarithmic approximation of perturbative qcd",
    "one finds the pomeron with intercept significantly above unity @xcite .",
    "since perturbative qcd is only applicable for the description of the `` hard '' processes one refers to this qcd pomeron as the `` hard '' pomeron .",
    "its relation to and interplay with the phenomenologically determined `` soft '' pomeron is still not fully understood .",
    "it should also be emphasised that the pomeron with intercept above unity leads to violation of unitarity at asymptotic energies .",
    "the unitarity is restored by multiple scattering absorptive ( or shadowing ) terms .",
    "the regge parametrisation of the total cross sections implies the following parametrisation of the electroproduction structure function @xmath25 : @xmath81 it is expected to be valid in the high energy limit and for @xmath82 . in this limit @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the regge parametrisation ( [ f2rrege1 ] ) implies the following small @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath25 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 at low @xmath1 the functions @xmath87 should obey the constraint ( [ f20 ] ) , i.e. @xmath88 for @xmath49 .",
    "the low @xmath1 region should join smoothly the photoproduction limit , @xmath3 . in this limit",
    "the following relation between the total photoproduction cross section @xmath89 and the structure function @xmath0 holds : @xmath90 this limit should be taken at fixed @xmath91 where @xmath92 is taken as photon energy in the laboratory frame .",
    "several structure function parametrisations use the photoproduction total cross section as an additional constraint .    when considering photoproduction it is conventional to decompose the total cross section @xmath93 into two parts : @xmath94    and then    @xmath95    in this equation @xmath96 denotes the cross section corresponding to the vmd photon  hadron interaction mechanism while @xmath97 to the partonic mechanism respectively .",
    "the partonic component of the cross section is next decomposed into two terms : the `` direct '' term which reflects the photon interactions with the partonic constituents of the hadron and the `` anomalous '' term which corresponds to the interactions of the partons  constituents of the photon with partonic constituents of the hadron . in the latter case the photon coupling to its constituents is point  like .",
    "the main feature of the partonic mechanism is that it corresponds to the ( semi ) hard interactions which can be described by perturbative qcd .",
    "the vmd part on the other hand contains both hard as well as the soft components .",
    "the former comes from the hard interaction of the partons which are the consituents of the vector meson . unlike the `` anomalous '' part this term",
    "can not be described by perturbative qcd alone since its description requires knowledge of the ( nonperturbative ) parton distributions in the vector meson .",
    "the anomalous term together with the hard part of the vmd contribution represent the point  like interaction of the partonic constituents of the photon . in the literature",
    "the corresponding events are therefore called the `` resolved '' photon events @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ siggam ] ) that the total photoproduction cross section can be obtained from the extrapolation of @xmath98 to @xmath3 .",
    "the partonic component @xmath97 ( i.e. the sum of the `` direct '' and the `` anomalous '' terms ) can be identified with the difference between the result of the extrapolation and the vmd part @xcite .",
    "the most important distinction between various mechanisms can be done through the analysis of the final states which will not be discussed here ( see @xcite ) .    the photoproduction total cross section , like the hadron@xmath4hadron total cross sections exhibits an increase with the increasing photon energy , @xcite , see fig.3 .",
    "this increase can be well described by the `` soft '' pomeron contribution with its intercept equal to 1.08 @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "it is also well described by the extrapolation of the parametrisation by abramowicz et al .",
    ", @xcite . both predictions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "another possible description of the total cross section increase is provided by the ( mini)jet production , i.e. production of jets with relatively low @xmath99 ( beginning from 1@xmath42 gev or so ) .",
    "the minijet production is described by the hard scattering of partons coming from the photon and from the proton respectively .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section reflects to a large extent the small @xmath2 behaviour of the parton ( i.e. mostly gluon ) distributions in a proton and in a photon .",
    "this follows from the kinematics of the hard parton  parton scattering : @xmath100 where @xmath101 denote the momentum fractions carried by partons and @xmath102 is the total cm energy . for increasing @xmath102 ( and for fixed @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 and @xmath105 may assume smaller values .",
    "the magnitude of the cross section is sensitive to the magnitude of the minimal value of @xmath99 .",
    "it can be shown that the multiple scattering ( or absorptive ) corrections are extremely important here and they slow down significantly the increase of the total cross section with energy @xcite .",
    "possible prediction for the total cross section energy dependence which follows from the minijet production picture are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the global quantity like the total cross section is not capable to discriminate between different models and the detailed structure of final states may be crucial here . the relevant monte carlo event generator for the minijet model with multiple scattering",
    "is discussed in @xcite .",
    "there exist several phenomenological parametrisations of the structure functions which incorporate the @xmath49 constraints ( cf .",
    "sec.2 ) as well as the bjorken scaling behaviour at large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "certain parametrisations @xcite also contain the ( qcd motivated ) scaling violations .",
    "the parametric form of the corresponding @xmath1 dependence , however , is not constrained at large @xmath1 by the altarelli ",
    "parisi evolution equations , i.e. those parametrisations are not linked with the conventional qcd evolution . nor is the low @xmath1 behaviour related to the explicit vector meson dominance , known to dominate at low @xmath1 , @xcite .",

    "shadowing seems to saturate at @xmath2 about 0.004 as was observed earlier by the e665 @xcite and indicated by the preliminary nmc data on the @xmath377 and @xmath378 ratios measured down to @xmath3500.0001 and @xmath1=0.03 gev@xmath6 , @xcite . no clear @xmath1 dependence is visible in the e665 data in a wide interval of @xmath1 , fig.24 .",
    "in this review paper we have summarised the present understanding of the electroproduction structure functions in the region of low values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which have recently been measured in the fixed target , charged lepton inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "this has included a survey of theoretical constraints and expectations , clarification of certain definitions and concepts , collection of the existing parametrisations of structure functions in this region and presentation of the experimental data .",
    "we consider this paper as being an extension of the comprehensive review article on the small @xmath2 physics @xcite towards the more detailed treatment of the low @xmath1 problems .",
    "this means in particular that in the summary of the experimental data we have presented only the results which appeared after the above mentioned article had been completed .",
    "important property of the structure function @xmath25 which follows from the conservation of the electromagnetic current is its linear vanishing as the function of @xmath1 for @xmath379 ( for fixed @xmath19 ) .",
    "this means that bjorken scaling can not be a valid concept at low @xmath1 and so the pure partonic description of inelastic lepton scattering has to break down for moderate and low @xmath1 values . at moderately large @xmath1 the higher twist contributions to @xmath0 which vanish as negative powers of @xmath1",
    "are frequently being included in the qcd data analysis .",
    "one also expects that at low @xmath1 the vmd mechanism should play an important role .",
    "the small @xmath2 behaviour of the structure function @xmath25 is dominated by the pomeron exchange .",
    "analysis of the structure function in the small @xmath2 region for both low and moderate values of @xmath1 can clarify our understanding of the pomeron , i.e. possible interplay between the `` soft '' and `` hard '' pomerons , the role of shadowing ( or absorptive ) corrections , etc . at large @xmath1",
    "the problem is linked with the qcd expectations concerning the deep inelastic scattering at small @xmath2 , see ref.@xcite for a recent review . besides the structure functions ( or total cross sections ) complementary information on the pomeron can also be obtained from the analysis of diffractive processes in the electro- and photoproduction .",
    "this concerns both the inclusive diffractive processes and the diffractive production of vector mesons ; the present experimental situation is described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "descriptions of the low @xmath1 , low @xmath2 behaviour of @xmath0 range from pure fits to experimental data to the dynamically motivated models .",
    "the existing parametrisations have been collected in a way which should make it easy to use in practical applications , e.g. in the radiative correction procedure . wherever possible a dynamical content of each parametrisation was exposed .    since 1992",
    "a wealth of measurements of @xmath0 has been published . in the region of interest for this paper",
    "this included the nmc and e665 results extending down to very low @xmath2 and @xmath1 values and displaying characteristic `` approach to scaling '' behaviour .",
    "nuclear shadowing phenomenon was studied in great detail for targets ranging from @xmath372 to @xmath373 by the same two collaborations .",
    "its @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath354 dependence was precisely measured .",
    "the new possibilities have opened up with the advent of the hera collider . presently the data there are collected at @xmath1 larger than approximately 5 gev@xmath6 and therefore have not been discussed in this review .",
    "these data show a very strong increase of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "let us remind that for fixed @xmath1 the increase of the structure function @xmath25 with decreasing @xmath2 reflects the increase of the virtual compton scattering total cross section with @xmath380 .",
    "we would like to emphasise that this increase observed at large @xmath1 is much stronger than the increase of the total photoproduction cross section observed between the fixed target and the hera energies .",
    "dynamical understanding of this evident variation of the @xmath380 dependence with @xmath1 is certainly very interesting and important .",
    "the experimental data at low values of @xmath1 ( @xmath381 gev@xmath6 ) which would cover similar range of @xmath380 as those at high @xmath1 would be extremely valuable for this purpose",
    ". it would therefore be very interesting to extend the hera measurement down to the low values of @xmath1 as it has been planned recently @xcite .",
    "we thank our colleagues from the nmc for numerous discussions and from the e665 collaboration for providing us with their data .",
