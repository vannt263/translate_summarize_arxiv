    "the majority of the ` diffuse ' @xmath0-ray emission of the milky way is truly diffuse , with the contribution from a superposition of unresolved , low luminosity point sources estimated at only the 5 - 10% level in the galactic plane .",
    "almost all of this diffuse emission is the consequence of propagating non - thermal hadronic cosmic rays colliding with the nuclei of interstellar particles ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and cosmic - ray electrons and positrons making bremsstrahlung @xmath0 rays .",
    "besides making @xmath0-rays a valuable tracer of the interstellar matter and radiation , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the diffuse emission encodes the spectrum of the interstellar cosmic rays .    using data taken in the first six months of _ fermi _ science operations",
    ", @xcite measured the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of gamma - ray emission associated with local neutral atomic hydrogen , hi , between 100 mev and 10 gev , finding that it is proportional to the hi column density and deriving an emissivity ( emission rate per h atom ) spectrum .",
    "many measurements of the hi emissivity in the neighborhood of the solar system and the outer galaxy were obtained using _ fermi _ data .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a new emissivity spectrum of local atomic hydrogen between galactic latitudes @xmath4 for energies",
    "@xmath1 mev to @xmath2 gev with error bars mainly @xmath5% .",
    "it is therefore an optimal time to use the emissivity to deduce the interstellar cosmic ray proton spectrum with improved accuracy .",
    "while our ultimate goal is the determination of the interstellar cosmic - ray proton and @xmath6-particle spectra from the measured diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emissivity @xcite , we first focus here on the topic of near - threshold neutral pion production .    due to the dominant abundance of protons in the cosmic rays , and plentiful hydrogen in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the most important process making the diffuse @xmath0-ray glow of the galaxy is @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is anything else made in the reaction besides @xmath0 rays , and the implied inclusive description already becomes dependent on the environment of the interaction , for example , through @xmath0-ray production by secondary leptons . for simplicity of analysis , we separately consider primary and secondary leptonic emissions , and confine the calculations only to the @xmath0-rays formed from the decay of @xmath3 ( @xmath9 s mean life ) produced through nuclear collisions .        as considered by @xcite , the gamma - ray spectrum from cosmic - ray proton distributions in the form of power laws in kinetic energy exhibits a significant hardening below proton kinetic energy @xmath10 gev .",
    "the importance of the nuclear physics uncertainties in performing the spectral inversion to characterize the limits of accuracy of the derived cosmic - ray proton spectrum  leaving aside leptonic and metallicity corrections  may undermine the conclusion about a spectral break , especially if the intrinsic spectrum is related to a power - law distribution in particle momentum , or momentum per unit charge ( gv / c ) @xcite .",
    "the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emissivity provides a clearer tracer of hadronic cosmic rays than snrs , which are generally too small to resolve , dim , or in a confused region .",
    "recent @xmath11 observations of snrs ic 443 and w44 , and agile observations of w44 @xcite , are providing strong evidence for a @xmath3-decay feature in the spectra of these snrs @xcite . for a general description of cosmic - ray origin and propagation ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum made by cosmic rays accelerated at their sources should be connected to the spectrum of cosmic rays in interstellar space , which is revealed by the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emission and , for cosmic - ray electrons , by radio synchrotron and inverse compton @xmath0-rays .",
    "determining the interstellar cosmic - ray spectrum from the @xmath0-ray emissivity , when related to the cosmic - ray spectra in snrs implied by their seds , will give information about cosmic - ray escape , and essential input for testing solar modulation theory .",
    "here we gather together a few of the tools needed to make an assault on the nuclear physics related to the galactic diffuse @xmath0-ray emissivity from proton interactions near threshold to a few gev kinetic energy , where resonance production is most important .",
    "surprisingly , the radiation physics for cosmic - ray electrons is known to better than a percent , determined by the fine - structure constant , but the pion - decay @xmath0-ray production cross section at the gev - scale is hardly known to @xmath12  20% accuracy .",
    "this is not likely to improve until new laboratory physics experiments measure these cross sections . in the meantime",
    ", we can assemble models for comparison .",
    "@xcite and @xcite list the following near - threshold decay products of @xmath13 collisions : @xmath14 and n(1440 ) , all of which decay through a @xmath3 to make @xmath0-rays . furthermore , there are baryonic and mesonic decays . in the former class",

    "meson - decay channels other than @xmath3 are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , with only the latter having a direct , non-@xmath3 @xmath0-ray production channel .",
    "keeping also in mind that direct production occurs in about half of the @xmath24 production cross section , which is @xmath25% of the total inelastic cross section , a very small correction to the symmetry properties of the gamma - ray production mechanism is possible .",
    "note the possible confusion between direct and @xmath24 production mentioned in ref .",

    "we consider whether isobaric production follows a scaling like behavior , where the invariant cross section becomes independent of @xmath26 , the invariant collision energy .",
    "we answer what appears to be a simple question , namely what the maximum photon energy produced through intermediate @xmath3 production is as a function of proton kinetic energy .",
    "then preliminary results for the determination of the interstellar cosmic - ray spectrum from the fermi - lat @xmath0-ray emissivity are presented .",
    "the proton kinetic energy is @xmath27 and the invariant square of the cm energy is @xmath28 in terms of the center - of - momentum ( cm ) lorentz factor factor is related to the lorentz factor @xmath0 as usual , @xmath29 , with corresponding subscripts and superscripts . ]",
    "@xmath30 at threshold , @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the pion - production threshold is @xmath32 3.6% larger than @xmath33 .",
    "the mass of the neutral pi - meson is @xmath34 mev ( @xmath35 mev ) .    in the aftermath of an inelastic nuclear collision",
    ", the invariant energy remains constant .",
    "a two - body collision leading to two bodies in the final state is a particularly well - defined event , with the final state assumed to consist of a baryon in a resonantly excited state , which decays into a p and @xmath3 , after which the @xmath36 decay is essentially instantaneous .",

    "the first is : does the isobar model follow a scaling representation ?",
    "most simply , the feynman scaling hypothesis that @xmath125 becomes independent of @xmath126 at large @xmath127 . by inspecting equation ( [ ed3sigmadp ] ) , one can see that while the invariant cross section becomes @xmath126-independent in the limit @xmath127 , this @xmath126-independent behavior is not followed by the isobar model .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows that unusual structure appears in the extreme situation where every event follows @xmath128 resonance formation and decay . as can also be seen , structure in the production spectrum is very sensitive to the relative isobaric and scaling contributions .",

    "we have derived the equations to answer this question precisely .",
    "the maximum photon energy @xmath131 where , using equation ( [ dndgammapi1 ] ) , @xmath132 substituting equations ( [ gamma * ] ) and ( [ bargamma ] ) into equation ( [ gammadelta ] ) , and using this result and equation ( [ gprimepi ] ) in equation ( [ gammapimax ] ) gives the result in terms of @xmath52 , where the allowed isobar mass range @xmath133 and depends on proton kinetic energy @xmath134 .",
    "the numerically calculated value of @xmath135 vs.  @xmath134 is plotted in figure [ f4 ] . at threshold ,",
    "@xmath136^{-1 } = 24.1$]% . at high energies , @xmath137",
    ". inverting this would give the minimum proton kinetic energy that makes a @xmath0-ray photon with energy @xmath104 , and restrict the integration in equation ( [ dotvarepsilon ] ) .",
    "lacking a simple analytic inversion , it is simpler to limit the integration numerically .    the results of this part of study indicate that the resonance and scaling contributions to pion production are very different , at least for the function of @xcite considered here .",
    "an improvement to existing models could be obtained by adding different resonance contributions using the isobar model according to the cross sections shown in figure [ f2 ] , rather than transitioning between exclusive and inclusive formulations using empirical relations .",
    "using the newly - measured emissivity spectrum @xcite , we can proceed to explore interstellar cr spectra that are compatible with it .",
    "the analysis is performed by first computing the matrices connecting model cr spectra to the observed gamma - ray emissivities in energy bands , and then scanning the parameter space of the models .",
    "the method is bayesian , allowing a complete scan of the parameters , computing posterior probability distributions , mean values and error bars correctly accounting for the correlations among the parameters .",
    "the method is bayesian , allowing a complete scan of the parameters to compute posterior probability distributions , mean values , and error bars in order to correctly account for the correlations among the parameters .    to illustrate the method ,",
    "the measured emissivities have been fitted with @xmath0-ray spectra calculated for a broken power law in momentum for protons and helium , with the free parameters being break momentum , spectral index below and above the break , and the overall normalization .",
    "the cr he / p ratio is fixed to the value measured by pamela at 100 gev / nuc @xcite , and the he and p spectra are assumed to have the same shape ( since they can not be distinguished in gamma rays ) . note that cr spectra are expressed as particle density per momentum , for the reason explained in @xcite .",
    "the use of a sharp break in the cr spectrum is over - simplified but serves to illustrate the method ; more physically plausible spectra are also being investigated , but they do not lead to essentially different results .    the first set of hadronic cross sections used is from @xcite .",

    "for @xcite the p - p cross sections are scaled for p - he , he - p and he - he interactions using @xcite .",
    "for @xcite the p - p , p - he , he - p cross - section are provided , so only he - he is scaled from p - p .",
    "the he fraction in the interstellar medium is taken as 0.1 by number .",
    "the electron ( plus positron ) spectrum producing bremsstrahlung is based on fermi - lat measurements above 10 gev @xcite , with a break below 3 gev as indicated by synchrotron data @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron data shown there require a flattening of the interstellar electron spectrum by about 1 unit in the spectral index below a few gev , so this is used as a constraint ; the actual low - energy index is determined by the gamma - ray fit .",
    "the resulting cosmic - ray proton and electron spectra and the corresponding emissivities are shown in fig  [ results1 ] .",
    "the fit to the measured emissivities is good , as can be expected with the freedom allowed .",
    "it is encouraging that the proton spectrum is close to that measured directly at high energies , having been determined from gamma rays alone with no input from direct measurements except for the he / p ratio .",
    "the solar modulation is clearly seen in the deviation of the interstellar spectrum from the direct measurements below 10 gev .",
    "bremsstrahlung gives an essential contribution below @xmath138 gev , and is an important component in the analysis .    in this particular example , the interstellar proton spectrum , because the flux @xmath139 .",
    "] steepens by about 1/2 unit in the momentum index above a few gev , compatible with the expectation from the cosmic - ray b / c ratio , which shows a similar break due to propagation . a power - law injection in momentum modified by propagation",
    "would then be a plausible scenario .",
    "the spectrum shown for @xcite cross sections has momentum index 2.5 ( 2.8 ) below ( above ) 6.5 gev , with a scaling factor 1.4 relative to pamela at 100 gev ; for the @xcite , @xcite cross sections the values are 2.4 ( 2.9 ) and 1.3 , with the same break energy .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the cross sections is evidently significant but not overwhelming , though the range of uncertainties in the production cross sections must be included in the error budget to derive firm conclusions . in both of these illustrative cases ,",
    "the high - energy proton index is compatible with pamela ( 2.82 ) @xcite .",
    "the scaling factor excess may have various origins , including uncertainties in the cross sections and the gas tracers , hidden systematic errors in the direct measurements themselves ; a combination of these is possible .",
    "a difference between the interstellar spectrum and the direct measurements can not be ruled out at this stage either .",
    "this is an example of how it will be possible to constrain the interstellar cr spectra with the fermi - lat emissivity data . in a forthcoming paper @xcite ,",
    "all the uncertainties will be addressed , including those in emissivities ( gas , instrumental response , etc . ) and cross sections .",
    "the evidence for a break and more exact constraints on the spectrum will be obtained there .",
    "the @xmath11 lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
