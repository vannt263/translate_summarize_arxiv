    "the study of the properties of @xmath2he clusters is currently an active area of theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "the interest is based on the fact that @xmath2he clusters provide an easily accessible example of a finite size quantum system of strongly correlated particles .",
    "one of the primary aims of he cluster research is to search for manifestations of superfluidity in mesoscopic systems .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies of glyoxal molecules embedded in @xmath2he droplets with about 5000 atoms produced in free jet expansions provide the first evidence that these droplets are indeed superfluid @xcite .",
    "the internal temperature of these droplets has also been measured spectroscopically to be about @xmath3 @xcite in agreement with theory @xcite .    even though there has been notable progress in theoretical work on he clusters during the last years the agreement between theory and experiments",
    "is not yet entirely satisfactory @xcite .",
    "the implementation of _ ab initio _ calculations still remains difficult for inhomogeneous systems with more than a few hundred atoms , while phenomenological theories , which work well for describing macroscopic properties , are often not adequate for systems of finite size .",
    "a major progress to fill this gap has been made in the development and use of density functional ( df ) theory @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the density profiles in the surface region of a quantum fluid has long been considered a very important basic problem @xcite . for this reason",
    "significant effort has gone into the experimental determination of the thickness of the bulk liquid - vapor @xmath2he interface @xcite .",
    "at least three different experimental methods have been used to measure the surface thickness of bulk liquid he .",
    "the first involved atomic scattering experiments @xcite yielding an interfacial width ( 1090% ) of about 4 . a surface thickness of about 9 was measured with an ellipsometric method @xcite .",
    "finally , x - ray measurements give a surface thickness of the order of 8 , providing also information on the shape of the interface @xcite . in droplets",
    "the surface atoms represent a significant fraction of the total number of atoms .",
    "for example , in a droplet with 5000 atoms about one half of the atoms are located in the surface region .",
    "thus the physical properties of @xmath2he droplets are strongly influenced by the surface .",
    "moreover , the surface region is particularly interesting because recent calculations predict that the bose - condensed fraction , which in bulk @xmath2he is about 10% , approaches 100% in regions where the density is still within 10% of the bulk density @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the liquid - vapor interface of large @xmath2he droplets ( @xmath1 ) is investigated by a new method .",
    "the experiment consists in measuring both the integral cross section of the droplets and also their number size distributions . from the integral cross section and the average number of atoms an effective droplet volume as well as an average density",
    "is determined .",
    "the results are compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "although a large number of calculations have been performed for the density profiles of small @xmath2he clusters ( @xmath4 ) @xcite no calculations for the large droplets investigated here have been reported so far . in the present work",
    "df theory is used to calculate the density profiles of large @xmath2he droplets .",
    "the density functional used was recently introduced by the orsay - trento collaboration @xcite .",
    "this functional provides density profiles and energies @xcite very close to the results of _ ab initio _",
    "monte carlo calculations @xcite in the case of small clusters and has the advantage that it can easily be applied to droplets with several thousands of atoms .",
    "these density profiles provide for a direct comparison with the experimental data and good agreement is found within the experimental errors .",
    "the droplet beam scattering apparatus is described in the following section .",
    "the procedure used to measure the number of atoms in the droplets and their classical integral cross sections are described in section [ sec : droplet_sizes ] and [ sec : integral_cross_sections ] . in section [ sec : mean_droplet_densities ] the experimental results are presented and in section [ sec : comparison_with_theory ] they are compared with the df predictions . a final discussion is given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "since the experimental methods and the apparatus used in this work have already been described in some detail in previous publications @xcite the experimental procedure will be only briefly described here .",
    "the @xmath2he droplet beam is produced by a free jet expansion of @xmath2he from a stagnation source chamber at a high pressure and at low temperature ( typically @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) through a thin walled ( @xmath7 ) nozzle with @xmath8 diameter .",
    "after the droplets have passed the skimmer and several differential pumping stages they are scattered by a secondary beam produced in another free jet expansion beam source which crosses the droplet beam at an angle of @xmath9 .",
    "the scattered droplets are detected with a homemade electron impact ionizer optimized for a high ionization efficiency followed by a magnetic mass spectrometer .",
    "the detector can be rotated around the scattering region in the plane of the two beams . to avoid capture collisions with",
    "the residual gas the background non - helium pressures in the differential pumping stages between source and scattering chamber were kept below @xmath10 .",
    "the atom number distribution @xmath11 of the helium droplets is determined from the angular distribution resulting from scattering by the secondary beam . a small portion ( 510% ) of the droplets",
    "is deflected by the momentum transfer imparted by single collisions of the secondary beam gas atoms , most of which are captured by the droplets @xcite .",
    "the measurements described in the present study have been carried out at source pressures of @xmath12 and @xmath13 and nozzle temperatures between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "for these conditions the droplet velocity distributions are very narrow ( @xmath16 ) with well known mean speeds @xcite .",
    "the secondary beam gases ar and kr were expanded from stagnation temperatures of about @xmath17 and several hundred millibar of stagnation pressure from a @xmath18 diameter nozzle .",
    "the secondary beam contains no appreciable amount of dimers or larger clusters , and has a narrow velocity distribution ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the angular distribution of the deflected droplet beam is measured by rotating the detector in small angular increments ( typically @xmath20 ) around the scattering center . due to the large mass of the droplets",
    "the deflection angles are very small and a high angular resolution is necessary .",
    "this is achieved by collimating the incident beam with a @xmath21 slit in front of the scattering center and a @xmath22 slit in front of the detector .",
    "the width of the expansion zone and the broadening due to collisions with the residual background gas ( mostly helium ) leads to a fwhm of the beam profile of about @xmath23 which defines the effective angular resolution .",
    "[ fig : distr ] shows three typical measured angular distributions with and without a flag in front of the secondary beam @xcite . the small difference between the two signals",
    "is attributed to droplets which were deflected after capturing a secondary beam atom .",
    "assuming complete momentum transfer the angle of deflection is directly dependent on the number of atoms in droplet . as is discussed in more detail below",
    ", the present experiments give further justification for the hypothesis of complete momentum transfer .",
    "the measured droplet atom number distributions can be very well fitted with a log - normal - distribution @xcite : @xmath24 , \\label{eq : lognorm}\\ ] ] where the mean number of atoms @xmath25 and the width ( fwhm ) are @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the fwhm is comparable with @xmath25 .",
    "table  [ tab : exp_tab ] lists the results for @xmath25 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , measured using ar and kr as deflecting atoms for a wide range of different @xmath2he source pressures and temperatures .",
    "the values of @xmath25 and @xmath31 obtained using ar or kr for identical @xmath2he source conditions do not always agree exactly , since they depend sensitively on the nozzle - diameter and on the nozzle - skimmer distance which was optimized for each experiment and differed slightly .",
    "in particular the mean droplet sizes for @xmath13 with krypton as secondary gas are somewhat smaller by about 30% since the nozzle used in these experiments had a diameter of only about @xmath32 as estimated from the total gas flow into the nozzle chamber .",
    "these deviations however have no appreciable effect on the average densities .",
    "the latter depend on the number of atoms in the droplets and the integral cross sections , both of which are determined in the same experiment under identical source conditions ( see below ) .",
    "the integral cross sections of the droplets are determined by measuring the attenuation of the forward peak in the deflection pattern ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : distr ] ) .",
    "the attenuation is related to the integral cross section @xmath33 of the droplets according to beer s law @xcite , @xmath34 \\ ; , \\label{eq : beer}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the intensities of the @xmath2he droplet beam with and without attenuation , @xmath37 is the number density of the secondary beam gas atoms in the scattering center and @xmath38 is the effective length of the scattering volume .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 is the speed of the droplets and @xmath40 the relative collision velocity .",
    "@xmath41 takes account of the smearing resulting from the velocity distributions of the two nozzle beams @xcite and leads to a correction smaller than about 1% .",
    "the product of the density in the scattering center and the effective length of the scattering volume @xmath42 was calibrated to within an error of approximately 5% by measuring the attenuation of a nearly monoenergetic helium atomic beam , for which the integral cross section can be accurately calculated quantum mechanically from the well established interaction potential @xcite .",
    "the density was calibrated three times with krypton and two times with argon at different collision energies and there was no evidence of systematic errors .",
    "the values of the absolute integral cross sections of the droplets are also listed in table  [ tab : exp_tab ] .",
    "the interpretation of the integral cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : beer ] ) is straightforward only in the ideal case of an infinite angular resolution . in this case one",
    "gets the quantum mechanical integral cross section , which includes the forward peaked diffraction part . in the present case of finite angular resolution",
    "the measured integral cross section is smaller since a fraction of the forward diffraction part of the differential cross section is not included . in order to estimate this correction , the quantum mechanical differential cross section for elastic scattering",
    "was calculated using a partial wave expansion method @xcite .",
    "the calculations , which are described in detail in appendix  [ app : cs ] , indicate that the contribution of the diffraction part to the elastic cross section is negligible with the angular resolution of our apparatus .",
    "thus the measured integral cross section @xmath43 turns out to be very close to the classical cross section @xmath44 .",
    "the two cross sections agree to within 1% for droplets with 1000 atoms and for larger droplets the agreement is even better .",
    "the finite width of the beam - profile also has the effect that the deflections of the largest droplets in the atom number distributions are too small to lead to a measurable attenuation of the beam .",
    "this error however can be estimated since the atom number distributions of the droplets and the beam - profiles @xmath45 are both well known from the measurements .",
    "the calculation yields a correction of about 1% for mean atom numbers of @xmath46 and of about 10% for droplets with @xmath47 atoms .",
    "measured values of the integral cross section , @xmath33 , as a function of the mean atom numbers @xmath25 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] .",
    "the values obtained with argon and krypton as secondary gas fall on a common curve and so we can conclude that the integral cross section is independent of the nature of the secondary beam , within the estimated accuracy .",
    "the overall experimental errors are estimated to be about 5% and result mainly from the uncertainty in the determination of the density of the secondary beam atoms in the scattering volume .    from the measured cross section an effective mean density @xmath48 , defined as the density of a uniform sphere with a sharp step edge ( liquid drop model ) having the same classical integral cross section ,",
    "is determined @xmath49 the values of @xmath48 , normalized to the bulk helium density @xmath50 @xmath51 , are given in the last column of table  [ tab : exp_tab ] and the integral cross sections for spheres of different density are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] as dashed lines . here",
    "the average integral cross section @xmath33 is calculated from the measured log - normal atom number distributions @xmath11 by means of the following equation : @xmath52 as can be seen , the experimental effective droplet density goes from about @xmath53 , for droplets with @xmath46 atoms , to @xmath54 for droplets with @xmath47 atoms .",
    "this trend is consistent with the fact that a significant part of the atoms are in the outer surface region , where the density is less than the bulk density .",
    "for comparison with the above experimental results the integral cross sections were calculated using density functional theory .",
    "these calculations were carried out with the improved density functional recently developed @xcite for the accurate calculation of @xmath2he droplet properties .",

    "the differences between argon and krypton are less than 1% and can therefore be neglected .",
    "the transmission for densities larger than about 10% of the central density is almost zero , so that the cross section is largely determined by the outer region of the droplet .",
    "since the transmission rises very steeply the effective droplet - border is rather sharp and corresponds to a radius ( @xmath77 ) where the density has fallen to approximately 1% .",
    "the integral cross section of the droplets is then calculated with the following equation : @xmath78 in a subsequent step the cross sections are averaged over the distribution in the number of atoms @xmath11 .",

    "this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical surface thicknesses are somewhat smaller than the experimental values .",
    "a simple model calculation can be used to check the effect of the surface thickness on the integral cross section .",
    "since all theoretical calculations predict the core density of these large droplets to be equal to the bulk density , the density profile can be rather realistically described by a simple analytic function @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 indicates the point where the density is reduced to 50% of the central density and @xmath84 is a parameter controlling the surface thickness . by relating the density profile to the integral cross section using the same procedure described in section [ sec : comparison_with_theory ] an experimental surface thickness",

    "we obtain a mean 1090% thickness of @xmath85  , which is somewhat larger than the results of the df calculation ( table [ tab : tab_dfc ] ) but still within the error limits .",
    "one has to stress here that the results are dependent on the model used for @xmath86 ; in particular , it assumes a symmetric density profile .",
    "most of the predicted density profiles are however slightly asymmetric , with a steeper slope in the outer part of the surface . by using an asymmetric profile , with an asymmetry similar to the one of the df profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , the estimated surface thickness is about 12  larger than the values shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : exp_prof ] .",
    "this would increase the discrepancy between the experimental estimates and the theoretical surface thickness .",
    "as discussed above it appears as if the experimental surface thickness is somewhat larger than the values predicted by the df theory .",
    "this is indicated by the 1025% differences in the average densities in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs ] and by the larger widths obtained using model profiles similar to eq.([eq : rho_r ] ) .",
    "since these differences are greater than the experimental uncertainties of 5% , we consider here possible sources of error .",
    "the possibility that the measured droplet atom numbers @xmath25 are too small , which would shift the mean effective density to smaller values , seems unlikely .",
    "this would require a momentum transfer in the deflection experiment even larger than the momentum @xmath87 of the impinging secondary atom . for elastic backscattering of the atoms in central collisions from a hard sphere",
    "the momentum transfer would indeed be @xmath88 .",
    "the momentum transfer averaged over all impact parameters for elastic scattering from a hard sphere is , however , equal to the momentum of the incoming particle @xmath87 .",
    "thus even in the unlikely case of elastic recoil scattering , which in view of the large mass of the argon and krypton atom compared to that of the he atom seems very unlikely and is not even expected for the scattering from a liquid helium surface @xcite , the same results would still hold .",
    "recoil scattering would also be in contradiction to the observation that the secondary gas is captured by the he droplets @xcite .",
    "another possibility is a backward directed vaporization of helium induced by the impinging secondary gas atom , as proposed by gspann @xcite . according to ordinary fluid dynamics",
    "this would also seem implausible , since the impact speeds are greater than the velocity of first sound of about @xmath89 @xcite and therefore a conical mach shock should be created which degenerates in a spherical sound wave .",
    "this sound wave would more probable induce vaporization in forward direction which would tend to shift our results to greater droplet atom numbers @xmath25 and would therefore increase the discrepancy with the theoretical results .",
    "the comparison between measured cross sections and df calculations is affected by at least two possible sources of problems .",
    "the first concerns the form and extent of the density profiles , and the second the overall shape of the droplets .",
    "the effect of different density profiles was already discussed in the previous section and has a noticeable effect .",
    "the 1090% surface thickness of the density profiles from the df calculations is a @xmath90  .",
    "this value is slightly less than other estimates .",
    "for example , previous df calculations for a planar free surface @xcite gave @xmath91  , while from _ ab initio _ calculations on small clusters @xcite values between 6 and 7  are predicted .",
    "some experimental and theoretical results for the surface thickness of the bulk liquid and droplets are summarized in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "the second possible reason why the measured cross sections are larger than the calculated ones from df could be that the helium droplets are not spherical , as assumed in the analysis , but have the shape of an oblate ellipsoid .",
    "a flattening of the droplets does not seem unfounded , due to the large angular momentum of several @xmath92 which some of the droplets may have as a result of collisions with the residual gas before arriving in the scattering region .",
    "a simple estimate indicates that in view of the large mass of the droplet , the resulting rotation speed is slow compared with the colliding secondary beam atoms .",
    "thus the effect of a possible deformation on the experimental results can be estimated from the calculated geometrical cross section of a rotational ellipsoid averaged over all orientations . in this estimate",
    "vibrational distortions , which at the low temperature should only have small amplitudes , are neglected .",
    "the radius of the ellipsoid is assumed to have the length @xmath93 and the radius of the axis of rotational symmetry is given by @xmath73 . for",
    "@xmath94 one gets an oblate and for @xmath95 a prolate ellipsoid .",
    "the geometrical cross section @xmath96 under an angle of view @xmath97 can be written as ( see appendix  [ app : ellips ] ) : @xmath98 \\ ; . \\label{eq : sigmaell}\\ ] ] the effective cross section is obtained by averaging numerically over all orientations , @xmath99 the resulting mean cross section is shown as a function of the ratio of the radii @xmath100 in fig .  [",
    "fig : ellips ] , scaled to the cross section of a sphere with the same volume . for a real droplet with lower density at the surface",
    "the effect will be even greater , since the surface area of the ellipsoid is larger .",
    "to explain the difference of 510% between the df results and the experiments , oblate shaped droplets with a value of @xmath101 or prolate droplets with @xmath102 would be required .",
    "oblate shapes with such small average @xmath100 ratios seem unlikely in view of the relatively small fraction ( @xmath10315% ) of the incident beam droplets which undergo collisions with the residual gas .",
    "thus we conclude that even in the very unlikely case that the droplets are somewhat distorted this has little effect on the measured surface thickness .",
    "by using a combination of scattering techniques ( deflection and attenuation ) , we have shown that it is possible to measure the average densities of large helium droplets .",
    "these results have been compared with density functional calculations which have been carried out for the large droplets with @xmath70 to @xmath47 helium atoms studied in the experiment .",
    "overall agreement can be considered to be satisfactory but on closer examination the predicted effective integral cross sections are too small be about 1020% and the densities too large by about 1025% , which is larger than the errors which are estimated to be about 5% .",
    "an attempt to fit the experimental data using a symmetric model density profile yields a value for the 1090% thickness of @xmath104  which is larger than the density functional value of 5.7    and is consistent with the differences in the densities .",
    "if an asymmetric profile is assumed 12  larger thicknesses are obtained which would increase the discrepancy .",
    "the assumptions made in the analysis were critically examined and an explanation for the small discrepancy can not be provided . as discussed in connection with table  [ tab : tab3 ] the situation is similar to the surface of the bulk where experiments also yield thicknesses which are larger than predicted by most theories .",
    "the experimental method has also been recently applied to @xmath105he droplets @xcite and there the average densities relative to the bulk are even smaller than found here for @xmath2he , a trend which is consistent with recent thomas - fermi theoretical calculations @xcite .    in the future it is conceivable that the present experimental method can be further improved to provide a sensitive quantitative probe of the outer surface region of large droplets . here",
    "it is interesting to speculate what effect the large condensate fraction in this outer region @xcite would have on the cross section .",
    "one can also explore the existence of a landau velocity below which the interaction should disappear , as it happens in the bulk liquid at 57 m / s .",
    "experiments under such conditions are now possible @xcite and are envisaged in the future .",
