    "trapped atomic ions have been regarded as a very promising physical system in quantum information processing .",
    "they have been used for many proof - of - principle experiments such as fundamental quantum gate operations@xcite , generation of entangled states@xcite , and quantum simulation of coupled spins@xcite . in these pioneering studies , the quantized motional and internal states of trapped ions",
    "were controlled using laser radiation . in spite of such successful works ,",
    "the use of laser radiation for coherent manipulation has a few issues .",
    "if two levels are coupled by a raman transition , spontaneous emission causes the destruction of quantum coherence@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if a ground state and a metastable state are chosen as a two - level system and driven by a quadrupole transition , hertz - level laser stability is typically demanded .",
    "in order to achieve further scalability , it is desirable to develop a system that is not affected by the decoherence due to spontaneous emission and is less demanding of the laser system .",
    "the use of radio frequency ( rf ) or microwave for the manipulation of quantum states has several advantages from these viewpoints@xcite .",
    "spontaneous emission does not affect the gate operation , which would lead to better fidelity in quantum - state manipulation .",
    "in addition , the generation and control of rf or microwave radiation requires a simpler system compared to that of laser radiation .",
    "thus , a laser system is used only for laser cooling and state detection , which reduces the demand on their stability . to perform the quantum simulation of interacting spins or two - ion entangling gates ,",
    "the state coupling of motional and internal quantum states is required . as proposed in @xcite , exposing an ion string to a magnetic field with spatially varying magnitudes enables such coupling .",
    "the coupling strength is proportional to the square of the field gradient .",
    "several studies aimed at generating a magnetic - field gradient at trapped ions have been reported .",
    "individual addressing of trapped ions and coupling of motional and internal states have been performed using permanent magnets , which were set at the outside of end electrodes of a linear paul trap @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the field gradient is limited by the distance between the ion and magnets because it is generally difficult to integrate magnets inside a conventional linear paul trap .",
    "one approach involved a current introduced on wires fabricated in a surface - electrode trap for the generation of magnetic - field gradients@xcite , which can reduce the distance between the ions .",
    "this design is suitable for improving scalability ; however , it requires heat management . another approach involved the use of oscillating magnetic fields in a surface - electrode trap@xcite .",
    "the use of the near - field amplitude gradient produced in a surface - electrode trap was proposed @xcite , and gate operation was demonstrated @xcite .    here , we present a different approach to generate a large field gradient at trapped ions .",
    "we integrate permanent magnets underneath a surface - electrode trap .",
    "this structure remarkably reduces the distance between permanent magnets and trapped ions .",
    "a large field gradient can be expected without any heat management .",
    "we discuss design considerations and present the numerical results of the magnetic field at the trapping region .",
    "we show that the trap is implemented by assembling a multi - segmented surface - electrode trap and an alumina plate in which permanent magnets are buried . to evaluate the field gradient , we observe the zeeman splitting of the @xmath2 - @xmath3 transition in a @xmath0ca@xmath1 ion at several positions .",
    "finally , we discuss the generation of an even larger field gradient .",
    "the trap is composed of two parts ; a surface - electrode trap and a magnet layer . the surface - electrode trap is made of a square alumina substrate , the surface of which is gold - plated to form electrodes .",
    "the magnet layer is also made of a square alumina plate , which has holes for placing permanent magnets .",
    "both the trap electrode and the magnet layer are squares of a side 11.5 mm .",

    "an rf voltage is applied to the two rf electrodes for radial confinement .",
    "a direct current ( dc ) electrode called center electrode is placed between the rf electrodes , and it is used for adjusting the height of the static potential minimum .",
    "there are nine dc electrodes on either side of the rf electrodes for axial confinement .",
    "ions can be trapped in any region except for the two outer regions , and they can also be shuttled between these regions by controlling the applied dc voltages . in the present work ,",

    "in order to evaluate the magnetic - field gradient , we measured the zeeman splitting of the @xmath2 - @xmath3 transition at several points along the @xmath4 direction in region b because the second - largest field gradient is expected without a large offset field of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . after trapping a single ca@xmath1 ion in region b ,",
    "a stray dc field was compensated for to minimize the excess micromotion of ions .",
    "in addition , we compensated for as much of the offset field of @xmath24 and @xmath25 as possible by using external coils attached outside the vacuum chamber .",

    "we also attempted to perform the experiments in region a , where the largest magnetic - field gradient is estimated ; however , the fluorescence from ca@xmath1 ion could not be observed .",
    "we also attempted moving the ion from the region next to a to region a. we could shuttle the ion , however , it was not possible to monitor the ion image while the ion remained in region a. we consider that this is due to the large offset field originating from a shift between the trap electrode and the magnet layer , which causes a large detuning in the transition at 397 nm .",
    "we measured the size of the shift between the trap and the magnet layer by using a laser microscope and found that the size of the shift was on the order of several tens of micrometers .",
    "the adjustment of the ion position by dc voltages is possible ; however , after the micromotion compensation @xcite , we can not apply an additional dc voltage freely . according to the calculation , a shift as high as 50 @xmath6 m can produce an offset field of approximately 5 mt in the @xmath4 direction at @xmath10 .",
    "it is difficult to cancel such a high offset field with our present external coils attached outside the vacuum chamber . to overcome the offset - field problem due to the shift between the trap electrode and the magnet layer , it is preferable to fabricate a magnet layer integrated with the trap electrode .",
    "other possible cause of excess offset magnetic field is that the magnitude of the magnetic field generated by each permanent magnet is uneven . to overcome this problem",
    ", we need to adjust the positional relation between the rf node and magnetic field .",
    "one possibility is to set the magnet layer on a movable stage inside the vacuum chamber that can be three - dimensionally moved with respect to the position of ions .",

    "the obtained field gradient of 36 t / m at a distance of approximately 350 @xmath6 m from the magnet layer is in good agreement with the calculation . from this result",
