    "small background at wavelengths of 0.8@xmath19 and 1.6@xmath19 and hst high angular resolution make nicmos a very efficient instrument in studying the faint galaxy population at high redshifts .",
    "the nicmos parallel imaging and grism observations were both made with camera 3 with a field of view @xmath20",
    "52@xmath21 52@xmath22 .",
    "the imaging data were taken with broad band filters f110w and f160w at 1.1@xmath19 ( j band ) and 1.6@xmath19 ( h band ) .",
    "the grism data has a spectral resolution of 200 per pixel and covers wavelength regions from 0.8@xmath19 to 1.2@xmath19 ( g096 ) and 1.1@xmath19 to 1.9@xmath19 ( g141 ) .",

    "the recent detections of dust enshrouded galaxies at @xmath23 at sub - millimeter wavelengths ( smail , ivison &  blain 1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; barger et al .",
    "1998 ; lilly et al .",
    "1998 ) suggest that significant amounts of star formation activity at high redshifts may be obscured .",
    "observations in the rest - frame uv wavelength suffer large uncertainties in extinction corrections .",
    "furthermore , little is known about the properties of normal galaxies in the region between @xmath24 , where neither the 4000  break nor the ly continuum break are easily accessible .",
    "the near - ir offers one means of accessing both redshift indicators and measures of star formation within this critical redshift range .",
    "we have reduced and analysed the nic3 parallel grism g141 data , covering @xmath20 65 sq .",
    "the details of the data reduction can be found in mccarthy et al .",
    "we found a total of 33 emission line galaxies over an effective co - moving volume of @xmath25  mpc@xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the implied co - moving number density of emission line galaxies in the range @xmath28 is @xmath3  mpc@xmath4 , very similar to that of the bright lyman break objects at @xmath5 .",
    "these objects have a median h@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath29 erg sec@xmath7 .",
    "the most , if not all , of the emission lines detected are either h@xmath1 or unresolved blend of h@xmath1+[nii]6583/6548 .",
    "this identification is mostly based on h - band apparent magnitudes , the emission line equivalent widths and the lack of other detected lines within the g141 bandpass .",
    "the median h - band apparent magnitude of @xmath2020.5 ( which corresponds to a l@xmath30 galaxy at @xmath31 ) implies that the possibility of the line being [ oii ] or h@xmath32 is very small .",
    "the redshifts of 6 galaxies in our sample have been confirmed by detection of [ oii]3727 emission in the optical spectra using lris on the keck 10 m telescope ( teplitz et al .",

    "we compute the h@xmath1 luminosity function ( lf ) based on our sample of emission - line galaxies .",
    "we have corrected the incompleteness in the original source catalog using simulations .",
    "the final correction is significant only in the faintest luminosity bin and our main result does not sensitively depend on that .",
    "all of the detailed results are in yan et al .",
    "figure 2 shows our derived h@xmath1 lf at @xmath9 and the local h@xmath1 lf as measured by gallego et al .",
    "this plot shows strong evolution in the h@xmath1 luminosity density from @xmath33 to @xmath10 .",
    "this is no surprise given the evolution in the ultraviolet luminosity density , but our result provides an independent measure of evolution for h@xmath1 emission alone .",
    "the lf is well fit by a schechter function over the range @xmath34 l@xmath35 ) @xmath36 erg sec@xmath7 with l@xmath37 erg sec@xmath7 and @xmath38 mpc@xmath4 for h@xmath8  km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and q@xmath39 .",
    "the integrated h@xmath1 luminosity density at @xmath10 ( our median @xmath40 ) is @xmath11  h@xmath12  erg s@xmath7 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath2014 times greater than the local value reported by gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we converted the integrated h@xmath1 luminosity density to a star formation rate ( sfr ) using the relation from kennicutt ( 1999 ) : @xmath41 .",
    "this assumes case b recombination at @xmath42  k and a salpeter imf ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this conversion factor is about 10% smaller than the value listed in kennicutt ( 1983 ) , the difference reflecting updated evolutionary tracks .",
    "while different choices of stellar tracks introduce modest uncertainties in the conversion of uv and h@xmath1 luminosities to star formation rates , the choice of different imfs lead to rather large differences . to make consistent comparisons between our results and those in the literature",
    "derived from 1500  and 2800  uv continuum luminosity densities , we adopt the relation from kennicutt ( 1999 ) : @xmath44 .",
    "this relation is appropriate for the salpeter imf used to derive the h@xmath1 conversion factor .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot uncorrected published measurements of the volume - averaged global star formation rate at various epochs .",
    "our result is shown as a filled circle .",
    "the star formation rates shown in figure 3 are calculated from the luminosity densities integrated over the entire luminosity functions , for both h@xmath1 and the uv continuum .",
    "lilly et al . and connolly et al",
    ". assumed a faint end slope of @xmath45 for the uv continuum luminosity functions at @xmath46 .",
    "the 1500  continuum luminosity function at @xmath47 measured from lyman break galaxies by steidel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) has a faint end slope of @xmath48 .",
    "the clear trend for the longer wavelength determinations of the star formation rate to exceed those based on uv continua is one of the pieces of evidence for significant extinction at intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the amplitude of the extinction correction is quite uncertain our measurement spans @xmath49 , overlapping with the connolly et al .",
    "photometric redshift sample and allowing a direct comparison between the observed 2800  luminosity density and that inferred from h@xmath1 .",
    "our h@xmath1-based star formation rate is three times larger than the average of the three redshift bins measured by connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the star formation rates derived from line or continuum luminosities depend strongly on the choice of imf , evolutionary tracks , and stellar atmospheres that are input into a specific spectral evolution model .",
    "the relevant issue for the present discussion is the ratio of the star formation rates derived from h@xmath1 and the 2800  continuum .",
    "this ratio differs significantly for the scalo and salpeter imfs and is a function of metallicity ( glazebrook et al .",
    "our choice of the salpeter imf comes close to minimizing the difference between the published uv- and our h@xmath1-derived star formation rates .",
    "the use of a scalo imf and solar metallicity would increase the apparent discrepancy by a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "the only model considered by glazebrook et al . that further reduces the h@xmath1/2800",
    "star formation ratio is the salpeter imf with the gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) spectral energy distributions , and this model still leaves us with a factor of @xmath50 enhancement in apparent star formation activity measured at h@xmath1 .",
    "if we attribute the entire difference to reddening , the total extinction corrections at 2800  and h@xmath1 are large and model - dependent .",
    "the calculation is sensitive to the relative geometry of the stars , gas and dust , as well as the adopted reddening curve . in the extreme case of a homogeneous foreground screen and a mw or lmc reddening curve ,",
    "we derive a@xmath51  magnitudes . in local starburst galaxies , differential extinction between the nebular gas , and stellar continuum , and scattering",
    "produce an effective reddening curve that is significantly grayer than the mw or lmc curves ( calzetti , kinney &  storchi - bergmann 1994 ; 1996 ; calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "the calzetti reddening law ( calzetti 1997 ) is appropriate for geometries in which the stars , gas and dust are well mixed . in this model ,",
    "our estimate of the dust extinction at 2800  is one to two magnitudes larger than in the simple screen case , and is an uncomfortably large correction compared to results from other methods .",
    "several groups have discovered a population of galaxies with extremely red colors r@xmath52k @xmath53 or 6 .",
    "however , the statistics of eros is still very poor and the nature of these objects remains unclear .",
    "the central issue is to understand whether eros are intrinsically red stellar systems formed at high redshifts in a monolithic collapse or highly reddened starburst galaxies at low to moderate redshifts .",
    "the detection of strong sub - mm continuum from ero hr  10 ( dey et al .",
    "1999 ; cimmati et al . 1998 ) provides conclusive evidence that some of eros , if not all , are indeed dusty , starburst galaxies at a star formation rate of @xmath54 at moderate redshifts ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we have obtained deep ground - based optical images of 27 nic3 fields , yielding @xmath20 20 square arcminutes . among these fields ,",
    "we have identified about a dozen of eros with r@xmath52h @xmath56 and h brighter than 20.6 .",
    "the surface density of eros with h @xmath57 20.6 and r@xmath52h @xmath56 is roughly 0.6/sq",
    ". arcminutes .",
    "we also found some evidence that eros are highly clustered .",
    "among 27 nic3 fields , we found 2 clusters of eros .",
    "figure 4 shows a cluster of eros in a single nic3 field ( 0.75@xmath58 ) where we also have k - band magnitudes .",
