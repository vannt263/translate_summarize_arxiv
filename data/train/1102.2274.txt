    "soon after the discovery of pulsars , it was shown that the radio emission from pulsars is highly polarized @xcite . the mean pulse profile and polarization properties of a pulsar",
    "are important for understanding the pulse emission mechanism , the beaming of pulsar radiation and the geometry of the system .",
    "mean pulse profiles often have a double or triple form , leading to a description of the emission in terms of `` core '' and `` conal '' beams @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the core and conal components had different emission mechanisms whereas @xcite argued that there was a gradual change in emission characteristics from the core region to the outer edge of the emission beam rather than distinct emission processes . to explain more complex pulse profiles , multiple emission cones were proposed and discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "an alternative model suggests that the emission beam of a pulsar is filled with randomly distributed emission patches @xcite .",
    "the patchy model may explain more complicated multi - component and asymmetric pulse profiles .",
    "polarization properties of radio sources are normally described in terms of the stokes parameters : @xmath0 ( total intensity ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( linear polarization ) and @xmath3 ( circular polarization ) .",
    "many pulsars show a systematic variation of the position angle ( pa , @xmath4 ) of the linearly polarized emission , @xmath5 across the pulse profile . in many pulsars",
    "the observed pa variations can be approximately described by the  rotating vector model \" ( rvm ) @xcite .",
    "this model originates from the idea that the radiation is polarized in the plane of curvature of field lines emanating from a magnetic pole on the star ; not surprisingly , curvature radiation has this property @xcite . for a simple dipole field , the observed pa variation",
    "is then determined by the projected direction of the magnetic axis as the star rotates .",
    "the rapid swings often observed near the profile mid - point imply that magnetic axis is nearly aligned with the observer s line of sight at that profile phase .",
    "circular polarization ( stokes @xmath3 ) is usually relatively weaker than linear polarization .",
    "it is most often associated with the central or core component of the profile , often with a sense reversal near the profile mid - point @xcite .",
    "observed pa swings are not always smooth and continuous .",
    "discontinuities of approximately 90  are often observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and these are interpreted as resulting from overlapping emission from orthogonally polarized emission modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such orthogonal modes may be generated as the wave propagates through the pulsar magnetosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in many respects , millisecond pulsars ( msps )",
    "have very different properties to those of `` normal '' pulsars . besides their obviously shorter periods , they have much smaller period derivatives and hence larger characteristic ages and weaker implied dipole magnetic fields .",
    "the pulse profile for millisecond pulsars generally has a much larger duty cycle , i.e. , the emission covers a much larger fraction of the pulse period , and a more complicated pulse profile compared to normal pulsars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this might be expected within the context of the magnetic - pole model since the pulsar magnetosphere , bounded by the light cylinder of radius @xmath6 is so much smaller .",
    "consequently , the polar caps defined by the open field lines ( those that penetrate the light cylinder ) are larger and the opening angle of these open field lines at a given radial distance @xmath7 and fractional polar - cap radius @xmath8 is also larger : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the field - line tangent angle with respect to the magnetic axis ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . despite these differences ,",
    "the polarization characteristics of msps are remarkably similar to those of normal pulsars  they have similar high degrees of linear polarization , orthogonal - mode pa jumps are observed and circular polarization with sense changes near the profile centre is seen in some msps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the emission characteristics are similar , indicating that the emission mechanism is basically the same for normal pulsars and msps , the pa variations in msps are often more complex and do not fit the rvm well .",
    "faraday rotation occuring in the interstellar medium is relatively easy to observe in pulsars because of the typically high degree of linear polarization .",
    "faraday rotation is quantified by the rotation measure ( rm ) , defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radio wavelength corresponding to radio frequency @xmath13 .",
    "faraday rotation in the interstellar medium is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vector magnetic field in microgauss and the integral is over the path to the pulsar , and so observations of faraday rotation can be used to investigate the galactic magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pulsars have the unique advantage that the dispersion measure @xmath16 is also known .",
    "we can therefore obtain a measure of the mean line - of - sight component of the interstellar magnetic field weighted by the local electron density along the path : @xmath17 where rm and dm are in their usual units .",
    "in this paper we report on the mean pulse profiles and polarization properties of the 20 msps which are being observed as part of the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project @xcite .",
    "details of the observing system and the observations are given in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] and polarization profiles for the 20 pulsars are presented in  [ sec : poln ] .",
    "rm results are presented in  [ sec : rm ] and the implications of the results are discussed in  [ sec : discn ] .",
    "as part of the ppta project , frequent observations of 20 msps are made using the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "regular observations at approximately three - weekly intervals commenced in mid-2004 .",
    "since that time , back - end signal processing systems have been upgraded several times .",
    "the main objective of these observations is to detect gravitational waves through high - precision pulsar timing .",
    "however , there are many secondary objectives , including studies of the pulse emission properties for pulsars in the observed sample .",
    "all ppta data are recorded in full - polarization mode , not only enabling full profile calibration , but also making possible detailed studies of the pulse emission properties .",
    "this paper reports on polarization results from observations made with the centre beam of the parkes 20 cm multibeam receiver @xcite with the second - generation parkes digital filterbank system pdfb2 between 2007 june and 2009 november .",
    "the fact that many observations are available for all 20 pulsars means that pulse profiles with very high signal / noise ratios can be formed , leading to new information about the profile shapes and their polarization .",
    "feeds in the parkes 20 cm multibeam receiver have orthogonal linearly polarized probes with a calibration probe at 45  to the two signal probes through which a linearly polarized broad - band and pulsed calibration signal can be injected .",
    "the system equivalent flux density on cold sky is approximately 30 jy . in common with the other parkes digital filterbank systems , pdfb2 digitizes band - limited signals from each of the two orthogonal probes at the nyquist rate with 8-bit sampling .",
    "it uses field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) processors to implement a polyphase filter to provide frequency resolution and a synchronous averager to form mean pulse profiles . for the observations reported here the total bandwidth",
    "was 256 mhz centred at 1369 mhz with 1024 channels across the band for most of the 20 pulsars .",
    "for all except psrs j1857 + 0943 , j1939 + 2134 and j2124@xmath183358 , each observation was of 64 minutes duration ; for the exceptions , the observation times were 32 minutes .",
    "all data were recorded using the psrfits data format @xcite with 1-minute sub - integrations and the full spectral resolution . to provide a calibration of the gain and phase of the receiver system , the pulsed calibration signal was recorded for 2 minutes prior to each pulsar observation .",
    "signal amplitudes were placed on a flux density scale using observations of hydra a , assumed to have a flux density of 43.1 jy at 1400 mhz and a spectral index of @xmath180.91 .",
    "the 20 cm multibeam feeds have limited isolation between the orthogonal polarizations .",
    "this cross - coupling was measured using series of observations of psr j0437@xmath184715 covering a wide range of hour angles , allowing correction for the effects of this coupling @xcite .",
    "off - line data processing made use of the psrchive pulsar data analysis system @xcite .",
    "first , band edges ( 5% on each side ) and spurious data resulting from narrow - band and impulsive radio - frequency interference were effectively excised from the raw data files .",
    "typically 1  2% of the spectrum and the time - domain data were excised .",
    "the data were then averaged in time to give eight sub - integrations for each observation .",
    "next , the data for each observation were corrected for variations in instrumental gain and phase across the spectrum and for the effects of cross - coupling in the feed . finally , baselines for each of the stokes - parameter profiles were set to zero mean and the data placed on a flux density scale .",
    "the baseline region was computed from the stokes @xmath0 profile and applied to all four stokes - parameter profiles . following this calibration ,",
    "stokes parameters were in accordance with the astronomical conventions described by @xcite .",
    "specifically , pas are absolute and are measured from celestial north toward east , i.e. , counterclockwise on the sky , and stokes @xmath3 is defined as @xmath19 , using the ieee definition for sense of circular polarization .    in order to form final mean polarization profiles , it is necessary to sum across the frequency channels taking into account the faraday rotation across the band .",
    "sufficiently precise rm measurements were not previously available for most of the ppta sample .",
    "we therefore determined rm values for each pulsar from the pdfb2 data sets .",
    "for each individual observation , the upper and lower halves of the total band were separately summed using the nominal rm value .",
    "an improved value of the rm was then calculated by taking a weighted mean of position angle differences for bins where the uncertainty in position angle was less than 10 .",
    "this process was iterated until convergence was obtained .",
    "the contribution of the earth s ionosphere to the total rm was estimated and then subtracted so that the measured rm just represents the interstellar contribution .",
    "ionospheric rms were computed using a prediction program farrot , developed at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory , penticton , which uses the observed solar 10.7-cm radio flux as a basic input .",
    "as the observations were made near a minimum of solar activity , ionospheric rms are relatively small , typically between @xmath20 and @xmath21  rad  m@xmath22 .",
    "the final interstellar rm for each pulsar was determined by taking a weighted mean of the individual interstellar rm measurements .",
    "in addition , the observed stokes parameters for each observation were adjusted ( effectively a pa shift ) using the ionospheric rm so that they represent the polarization state at the top of the ionosphere .",
    "it is also necessary to have a precise timing model for each pulsar before adding the data in time to form a final mean profile .",
    "pulse times of arrival were obtained for each observation using an analytic template based on an existing high signal / noise ( s / n ) ratio pulse profile .",
    "the tempo2 pulsar timing package @xcite was then used to fit pulsar spin and astrometric and binary parameters as necessary to give `` white '' timing residuals for the pdfb2 data set for each pulsar .",
    "finally , the separate observations were summed using this timing model to determine relative phases to form the final stokes parameter profiles . to give the best possible s / n ratio in the final profile , the individual observation profiles were weighted by their ( s / n)@xmath23 when forming the sum profile .",
    "the polarization parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and pa were then computed from the stokes parameters .",
    "the noise bias in @xmath26 was corrected using the relations given by @xcite and the similar bias in @xmath25 was corrected using @xmath27 when @xmath28 or zero otherwise , where @xmath29 is the rms profile baseline noise .",
    "table  [ tb : obs ] gives the basic pulsar and observational parameters for the 20 ppta pulsars which were observed .",
    "after the pulsar name , pulse period and dm , we give the number of frequency channels across the 256-mhz band and the number of bins across the pulse period . the dispersion smearing across each frequency channel , given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the channel width in mhz",

    "in fact , for a pulsar period of 4  ms and an overall pulse width of @xmath70 ( about the median values for our sample ) , equation  [ eq : beam ] implies @xmath71 .",
    "one could invoke small inclination angles , but it is more likely that the equation is simply not applicable .",
    "similarly , the standard methods for estimating emission heights can not be applied to msps .",
    "they do not exhibit radius - frequency mapping of component separations and hence that method @xcite can not be used .",
    "likwise , the method of @xcite , which relies on identifying a relativistic aberration / retardation shift between the pulse profile and the pa variations , can not be applied because of the general lack of symmetry about a central longitude for one or both properties . for example , psrs j0437@xmath184715 and j2145@xmath180750 both have reasonably symmetric pulse profiles , but in both cases it is impossible to determine any symmetry centre for the pa variations .",
    "relativistic methods which rely on a height difference between core and conal components @xcite also can not easily be applied to msps since it is generally impossible to uniquely identify components as either core or cone .    based on associations with gamma - ray detections , @xcite and",
    "@xcite argued that radio beams from young and millisecond pulsars are emitted from the outer magnetosphere and that caustic effects are important in defining the observed pulse profile . by analogy with gamma - ray pulse profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such effects may account for the broad frequency - independent pulse profiles observed in msps , including interpulses and connecting bridges .",
    "the results presented in this paper support this idea .",
    "the observed pulse profiles are too wide and too complex to be simply accounted for as emission tangential to the open field lines at low altitudes in the pulsar magnetosphere . observed pa variations are also generally inconsistent with this interpretation .",
    "for example , the extended low - level emission observed for psr j1939 + 2134 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1939 ] ) shows that main pulse and interpulse in this pulsar are not simple polar beams from opposite magnetic poles as was originally thought . in this context , it is important to note that , for both the crab pulsar and psr j1939 + 2134 , giant radio pulses occur at phases closely related to the phase of the high - energy emission and to the main radio peaks @xcite also supporting the idea of the radio emission originating in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite discussed the caustic deformation of radio pulse profiles by aberration and retardation , albeit to a more modest degree than that proposed above . trailing sides of profiles",
    "are compressed in width and enhanced in amplitude whereas leading parts are spread out and reduced in amplitude .",
    "they apply these ideas to the main pulse of the msp j1012 + 5307 , which has a strong trailing component and a weaker more extended leading part , and can model the observed profile with a patchy underlying emission and a small relativistic deformation , with the emission originating between the stellar surface and twice that radius .",
    "of the pulsars we observed , only psr j1022 + 1001 and maybe psr j1600@xmath183035 have similar profiles with a relatively strong and narrow trailing component .",
    "it is clear that these ideas are not generally applicable to msps .",
    "@xcite suggested that emission from many young pulsars arises from the outermost open field lines at relatively high altitudes , between 5 and 15 per cent of the light - cylinder radius .",
    "we are proposing that for msps ( and some young pulsars as well ) the emission zone extends much higher , up to or even beyond the null - charge surface , with caustic deformations a dominant influence on the profile morphology . to account for the multiple components and complex pa variations observed in msps",
    ", much structure is required in the underlying emission .",
    "this could originate from isolated plasma streams as suggested by @xcite with the observed pa determined by the projection of the stream axis or by the local magnetic field direction . in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", such currents will significantly deform the basic dipolar field , leading to the observed small - scale pa variations and discontinuities .",
    "it is worth noting though that the observed complex profile and pa variations are extremely stable over timescales of decades ( compare the psr j0437@xmath184715 profiles in @xcite and in fig .",
    "[ fig:0437 ] ) .",
    "observations of nulling and mode - changing in normal pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that magnetospheric currents can vary on short timescales , but to date there is little evidence that such phenomena exist in msps . even in normal pulsars ,",
    "the properties of a given mode seem quite stable .",
    "inwardly directed emission beams from charges flowing toward the neutron star @xcite provides another possible explanation for the multiple and overlapping components of msp pulse profiles .    despite the generally more complex pulse profiles of msps compared to normal pulsars , there are many similarities in the emission characteristics .",
    "fractional linear polarizations are often very high for both classes of pulsar , orthogonal - mode transitions are ubiquitous in both classes and circular polarization is often seen , but is almost always weaker than the linear polarization .",
    "truly orthogonal polarization transitions ( both circular and linear changing sign ) do seem more common in msps with at least five clear examples ( in psrs j0437@xmath184715 , j1600@xmath183053 , two in j1643@xmath181224 and j1713 + 0747 ) among the 20 ppta pulsars presented here .",
    "overall though , the similarities in polarization behaviour outweigh the differences , strongly suggesting that the basic radio emission mechanism is the same for both normal pulsars and msps .",
    "we derive rms for all 20 pulsars , eight of which have no previously published rms .",
    "for those with previously published rms , our measurements have smaller estimated uncertainties and we believe they are more accurate than the previous values . for three pulsars ( j1824@xmath182452 ,",
    "j1939 + 2134 and j2145@xmath180750 ) our measurements differ significantly , indicating systematic errors , most probably in the earlier measurements .",
    "rms and implied mean values of the line - of - sight component of the interstellar magnetic field are small for high - latitude and more distant pulsars in accord with earlier results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most measured values are less than or about @xmath72 g , but that for psr j1643@xmath181224 at @xmath73 g is an exception .",
    "the estimated distance for this pulsar is only about 0.5 kpc and the path to it traverses the north polar spur @xcite .",
    "the large mean field strength almost certainly results from compressed interstellar fields in the shell(s ) which form this prominent feature of the galactic radio background .      the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project is a collaboration between a number of groups both in australia in other countries established with the support of rnm s australian research council federation fellowship ( # ff0348478 ) .",
