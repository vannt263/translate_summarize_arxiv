    "the acceleration expansion of the present universe has been accepted by many observational evidence @xcite .",
    "although the dark energy ( de ) scenario with a negative pressure can drive this expansion , the modified gravity , so called @xmath0 gravity , has been introduced as a self consistent and nontrivial alternative way to explain early time inflation and present acceleration expansion . in @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the einstein - hilbert action is modified and generalized by incorporating a new phenomenological function of ricci scalar , @xmath0 .    on the other hand",
    "the dynamical de models are proposed in order to solve de problems ( cosmic coincidence and fine tuning problems ) .",
    "recently , the veneziano ghost de has been attracted a deal of attention in the dynamical de category .",
    "the veneziano ghost is proposed to solve the @xmath1 problem in low - energy effective theory of qcd @xcite and has no contribution in the flat minkowski spacetime . in curved spacetime , however , it makes a small energy density proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is qcd mass scale and @xmath4 is hubbel parameter .",
    "this small vacuum energy density can be considered as a driver engine for evolution of the universe .",
    "it should be mentioned that the veneziano ghost de model does not violate unitarity , causality , gauge invariance etc @xcite .",
    "in fact the description of de in terms of the veneziano ghost is just a matter of convenience to describe very complicated infrared dynamics of strongly coupled qcd . in other words ,",
    "the veneziano ghost is not a new physical propagating degree of freedom .",
    "the same dynamics can be described without using the ghost , with some other approaches ( e.g. direct lattice simulations ) .",
    "also note that this model is totally arisen from standard model and general relativity .",
    "therefore one needs not to introduce any new parameter or new degree of freedom and this fact is the most advantages of ghost de . with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the right order of observed de density can be given by ghost de .",
    "this numerical coincidence also shows that this model gets ride of fine tuning problem @xcite .",
    "many authors have already suggested de model with energy density as @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "generally it is very difficult to accept such a power like behavior as qcd is a theory with a mass gap determined by the scale @xmath9 mev .",
    "the power like scaling @xmath10 is due to the complicated topological structure of strongly coupled qcd , not related to the physical massive propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact the linear in hubble constant  @xmath4 \" scaling is not a baseless assumption , but rather has a strong theoretical support tested in a number of models , and tested in the lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "recently the ghost - scalar field models have been investigated @xcite .",
    "further more ghost de model has been fitted with current observational data including snia , bao , cmb , bbn @xcite",
    ".    on the other hands , a consistent @xmath0 function in modified gravity context , has been reconstructed by many dynamical de models @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the modified @xmath0 gravity model considered as an effective description of the underlying theory of de , and considering the ghost de scenario as pointing in the direction of the underlying theory of de , it is interesting to study how the @xmath0 gravity can describe the ghost de density as effective theory of de models .",
    "this motivated us to establish the different models of @xmath0 gravity according to the ghost and generalized - ghost de model . in this paper",
