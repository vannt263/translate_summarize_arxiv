    "the observed architectures of stellar systems depend both on the formation processes and subsequent evolution . in many cases",
    "the orbits preserve information about the formation processes , and their study helps us to understand the physics of fragmentation , accretion , and early evolution of stars .",
    "this information is gleaned from observations of young binaries , from statistics of binary and multiple stars in different environments @xcite , and from unusual objects that reveal the history of their formation like `` rosetta stones '' .",
    "one such object is featured here .",
    "the 7th magnitude g1v star studied here is known as hd  91962 , hip  51966 , wds j10370@xmath20850 , or ads  7854 ; the j2000 coordinates are 10:37:00.01 , @xmath208:50:23.7 .",
    "it is located at a distance of 36pc from the sun .",
    "hd  91962 is an x - ray source rx  j1036.9@xmath20850 and a hierarchical quadruple system ( figure  [ fig : str ] ) .",
    "the outer binary a , b ( a  556 ) is known since 1903 @xcite .",
    "its orbit with @xmath3yr by @xcite was recently revised by @xcite .",
    "we show below that the period is close to 200yr .",
    "the original _ hipparcos _ parallax is 27.5@xmath11.3mas , the new _ hipparcos _ reduction @xcite revised it to 25.1@xmath11.2mas .",
    "however , the _ hipparcos _ parallax could be biased by the orbital motion which was not taken into consideration in its data reduction .",
    "the subsystem aa , ab ( tok  44 ) was discovered by @xcite with adaptive optics in 2003.354 , at 0142 , 562 , @xmath4 mag .",
    "independently , it was resolved in 2009 by speckle interferometry at soar @xcite and was measured several times since then .",
    "the pair aa , ab was seen in 2012.18 at the same position as in 2003.35 , completing one full revolution .",
    "the orbital period is therefore well constrained by the speckle measurements .",
    "dl independently determined the spectroscopic orbit of aa , ab with a period of @xmath5 days ( 8.85yr ) and discovered the inner spectroscopic subsystem aa1,aa2 with @xmath6d .",
    "this is therefore a hierarchical quadruple system with a 3-tier `` planetary '' architecture , where all components revolve around the most massive central star aa1 .",
    "the two inner orbits have small and similar eccentricities and their apsidal angles are also similar .",
    "we show below that these orbits are locked in a 1:19 mutual resonance .",
    "the period of the outer visual orbit is about 20 times longer than the period of the middle orbit .",
    "the observational material is presented in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "it is used for calculation of the orbits in section  [ sec : orb ] and for the estimate of component s masses and distance to the system ( section  [ sec : mass ] ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "disc ] we discuss the formation mechanism of such hierarchies and give examples of other 3-tier hierarchical systems with known orbits .",
    "all resolved measurements of the middle subsystem aa , ab except the first one come from the 4.1-m soar telescope .",
    "the instrument and data reduction are described by @xcite .",
    "the observations were made with the 534/22 nm interference filter close to the strmgren @xmath7 band and the 788/132 nm filter approximating the cousins system @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : acf ] presents samples of the speckle auto - correlation functions ( acfs ) of the resolved triple star . the relative position and brightness of the components",
    "is determined by least - squares fitting of the power spectrum to a triple - star model ( not from the acf ) .",
    "the orientation of the inner pair is determined without the usual @xmath9 ambiguity when the correlation peak between ab and b is detectable ( it is barely seen in the @xmath7 filter ) .",
    "three observations made in 2014 are still unpublished .",
    "after submission of the manuscripot , two more measurenments made in 2015 were added , slightly reducing the errors of the middle orbit .",
    "we also use one unpublished measure of a , b made in 2001 by bm ( the subsystem was not resolved ) .",

    "eighty - four observations were obtained with the cfa digital speedometers @xcite , initially using the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory in the town of harvard , massachusetts , and subsequently with the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the whipple observatory on mount hopkins , arizona . starting in 2009 the new fiber - fed tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used to obtain an additional ten observations .",
    "the spectral resolution was 44,000 for all three spectrographs , but the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per resolution element of 100 for the tres observations was a few times higher than for the cfa digital speedometer observations .",
    "the total light of hd 91962 is dominated by the component aa1 , and at visible wavelengths the spectrum appears single - lined .",
    "therefore we followed our standard procedure of using one - dimensional correlations of each observed spectrum against a synthetic template drawn from our library of calculated spectra .",
    "the radial velocity ( rv ) zero point for each spectrograph was monitored using observations of standard stars , of daytime sky , and of minor planets , and the velocities were all adjusted to the native system of the cfa digital speedometers . to get onto the absolute velocity system defined by our observations of minor planets , about 0.14 km  s@xmath13 should be added to the velocities reported in table  3 .",
    "these velocities are all based on correlations of just a single echelle order centered on the mg b triplet near 519 nm , with a wavelength window of 4.5 nm for the cfa digital speedometers and 10.0 nm for tres .",
    "the ten tres observations were analyzed with the stellar parameter classification tool ( spc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : teff ] .",
    "as they are mutually consistent , we list the average values of stellar parameters and their errors estimated from the scatter of ten measurements .",
    "the parameters found in the literature are given for comparison .",
    "the star aa1 dominates in the visible light , with all other components together contributing only 14%",
    ". therefore their influence on the derived stellar parameters of aa1 is minor .",

    "estimated or assumed quantities are given in brackets for reference .",
    "the orbital elements and their errors are determined by the unconstrained least - squares fit to the data ( rvs , positional measurements , or both ) with weights inversely proportional to the squares of the measurement errors . the center - of - mass velocity is common to all three orbits , but we do not know yet the spectroscopic elements of a , b and arbitrarily ascribe @xmath35 to the inner pair aa1,aa2 meanwhile .",

    "the speckle measurements of aa , ab and residuals to its orbit are listed in table  [ tab : aa ] .",
    "the first measurement is made by @xcite , all remaining measurements are made at soar .",
    "the orbit of the middle pair aa , ab was initially determined independently from both speckle interferometry and rvs .",
    "we used the initial spectroscopic orbits of aa , ab and aa1,aa2 fitted jointly to the rv data alone as a first approximation to the combined orbit of aa , ab ( the 170-d orbit was then subtracted from the rvs ) . with this combined solution , another iteration on the inner system",
    "was made , giving essentially the same elements .",
    "the weighted rms rv residual to both orbits is 0.42 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sborb ] shows the rv curves , while figure  [ fig : vborb ] shows the visual orbits of aa , ab and a , b .    the final elements of aa , ab and their errors are determined by the least - squares fit to both rvs and resolved measures .",
    "the speckle errors are assumed to be 5mas prior to 2014 ( except for one less precise measure ) . and",
    "2mas for 20152015 .",
    "the rms residuals are 12 and 3.4mas in @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we had to adopt realistic speckle errors ( hence weights ) to reach the correct balance between positional measurements and rvs .",
    "the formal errors delivered by the speckle data processing are smaller , typically under 1mas .",
    "we updated the visual orbit of the outer system a , b = a  556 ( see the elements in table  [ tab : orb ] , obseravtions and residuals in table  [ tab : ab ] ) .",
    "the speckle measures of aa , b ( all data from soar where the triple is resolved ) are translated into the positions of a , b , where a refers to the center of mass of aa , ab . the position of the inner pair aa , ab was calculated from its kown orbit and the vector directed from aa to ab was added to the vector aa , b with a coefficient @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the mass ratio in aa , ab ) . the unresolved accurate measurements ( 19912001 )",
    "were corrected with @xmath42   = -0.237 $ ] , considering that they refer to the photo - center of aa , ab and not to a or aa ( @xmath43 is the light ratio ab / aa ) .",
    "this correction substantially reduces the scatter of accurate speckle measurements ( see the scheme and the zoomed portion of the orbit in figure  [ fig : vborb ] , left ) .",
    "the visual micrometer measurements are left uncorrected , as the effect of aa , ab is @xmath44mas .",
    "they are assigned errors of 01 , except the four highly deviant micrometer measurements that were given larger errors to cancel their influence on the orbit .",
    "it turns out that the data do not yet constrain all elements of the outer pair a , b .",
    "equally good solutions can be obtained by fixing the period at different values within a certain range ; longer periods correspond to a smaller mass sum .",
    "the orbit given here assumes @xmath45yr and gives the mass sum of 2.68 @xmath16 for a parallax of 27.6mas .",
    "the unconstrained fit gives @xmath46 years .",
    "using the masses estimated below , we calculate that the rv amplitude in the a , b orbit is @xmath47 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the ephemeris predicts that the rv(a ) should change by @xmath48 km  s@xmath13 during the period 19912014 covered by the observations .",
    "we fitted the rv residuals by a linear function and found the coefficient of @xmath49 km  s@xmath13  yr@xmath13 , or a total change of @xmath50 km  s@xmath13 during the 23-yr period of rv observations .",
    "the concidence of those numbers is accidental , given that the rv trend is not formally significant .",
    "however , the _ sign _ of the emerging rv trend tells us that the node of the orbit of a , b is probably chosen correctly .",
    "therefore , the orbits of a , b and aa , ab are nearly co - planar ( the angle between the angular momenta is @xmath51 ) . if the node of the outer orbit is changed by @xmath9 , then @xmath52 . in such case ,",
    "the kozai - lidov cycles would have made the middle orbit highly eccentric and would have destroyed the architecture of this multiple system .",
    "the calculated semi - major axis of aa1,aa2 is 18.4mas .",
    "the `` wobble '' of aa due to the inner subsystem should have an amplitude of 4mas .",
    "the orientation of the inner orbit aa1,aa2 can be established by frequent and precise speckle measurements of aa , ab . the measurements of aa , ab made in 20142015 seem to deviate from the middle orbit in a systematic way , but we could not yet use the residuals for determining the elements @xmath36 and @xmath33 of the inner orbit .",
    "the reason is that the number of measurements of aa , ab is still modest , leading to a cross - talk between the elements of the middle and inner orbits .",
    "the co - planarity of those orbits thus remains hypothetical .",
    "however , the moderate eccentricity of the inner orbit implies the absence of kozai - lidov cycles , hence mutual inclination @xmath53 .",
    "an attempt was made to measure the rvs of the faint components ab and b using two - dimensional correlation , todcor @xcite .",
    "three well - exposed spectra from tres ( jd 2455169 to 2456743 ) were processed using synthetic templates with effective temperatures @xmath54 of 5750 and 4500k .",
    "a second maximum was seen at velocities of 21.74 , 21.44 , and 25.07 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "all three dates are close to the node of the middle orbit aa , ab , so the measured velocities of the secondary , if real , correspond to a blend between ab and b. the measurements should be repeated in a couple of years , at a different phase of the middle orbit .",
    "the masses and distance were determined iteratively , using photometry and orbital elements .",
    "several assumptions are made : ( i ) the stars are not evolved and follow standard mass - luminosity relations for main sequence stars ; ( ii ) the component aa2 contributes little light in all bands , and ( iii ) the inner orbit aa1,aa2 has an inclination of @xmath55 .    using the initial estimates of masses from the absolute @xmath14-band magnitudes , we determine the dynamical parallax from the middle orbit aa , ab , then refine the masses and other parameters .",
    "the numbers given below were obtained in the last iteration .",
    "the mass of aa1 is 1.14 @xmath56 , as determined from the isochrone in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "then the orbit of aa1,aa2 and the assumption ( iii ) lead to the mass of aa2 of 0.32@xmath16 .",
    "the mass of aa is therefore 1.46@xmath16 .",
    "the orbit of aa , ab with known inclination leads to the mass of 0.64 @xmath57 for ab .",
    "the mass of a=(aa+ab ) is therefore established at 2.10 @xmath16 and its semi - major axis is 5.48au .",
    "the semi - major axis of aa , ab is measured at @xmath58mas and leads to the dynamical parallax of @xmath59mas , i.e. a 2% accuracy on the distance .",
    "the distance is proportional to the mass sum to 1/3 power , so revision of the mass estimates would have a minor effect on the dynamical parallax .    using the distance and photometry , we place the components aa , ab , and b on the color - magnitude diagram ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of b corresponds to a main - sequence star of 0.74  @xmath60 .",
    "however , the components ab and b have similar luminosity , so we adopt the mass of 0.64  @xmath16 for b , close to the measured value for ab . the mass sum of a+b is therefore 2.74  @xmath16 .",
    "the orbit of a , b with a fixed period of 205yr and the parallax of 27.4mas corresponds to such a mass sum .",
    "the four known components of the quadruple system hd  91962 are normal dwarfs that match the standard mass - luminosity relation . we can not exclude additional low - mass satellites revolving around ab or b , as their rvs were not measured directly , while the constraints from the photometry and orbits are not tight enough .",
    "the system appears to be young .",
    "@xcite measured the lithum 6707   line strength of 73m , axial rotation of 17 km  s@xmath13 , and detected chromospheric emission in a spectrum with a resolution of 16,000 .",
    "@xcite confirmed the chromospheric emission , explaining the x - ray flux .",
    "the star does not belong to any known kinematic group .",
    "no excess far - infrared emission was found with _",
    "indeed , a debris disk would not survive inside this multiple system . if the dust exists outside the orbit of a , b it would be too cold to be detectable .",
    "all three orbits have low eccentricity .",
    "the orbits of a , b and aa , ab have mutual inclination of @xmath61 .",
    "small eccentricities imply the absence of the kozai - lidov cycles , hence moderate mutual orbit inclinations at all hierarchical levels .",
    "moreover , the longitudes of periastron @xmath37 in all three orbits are also similar , showing that the lines of apsides have similar orientation .",
    "one ca nt help noting the similarities of the orbits while comparing the left and right parts of figures  [ fig : sborb ] and [ fig : vborb ] .",
    "the period ratio between the middle and inner systems is @xmath62 .",
    "it appears that these orbits are in a weak 1:19 resonance .",
    "the period ratio of the outer and middle systems is about 23 ( it is not accurate enough to check for a resonance ) .",
    "the quadruple system is dynamically stable and is organized in a regular way , remiscient of the solar system ( figure  [ fig : str ] ) .",
    "similar eccentricities and apsidal angles , as well as the resonance , suggest that the companions interacted with each other during their formation and early dynamical evolution .",
    "this quadruple system could originate in an isolated rotating core .",
    "rotation prevented immediate collapse .",
    "the gas formed a massive and unstable disk which fragmented into a companion .",
    "continuing accretion onto the companion increased its mass and caused inward migration , while dissipative gas friction maintained the low orbital eccentricity .",
    "the first companions could have merged with the central body aa1 , while other companions were formed on the periphery and migrated inwards .",
    "the process was stopped when the gas reservoir was exhausted or lost , leaving the last three surviving companions aa2 , ab , and b. this scenario , although speculative , matches the observed properties of hd  91962 .",
    "most quadruple systems consist of two close pairs in a 2 + 2 hierarchy , while the 2-tier hierarchies of 3 + 1 `` planetary '' type are less typical ; they are found in about 1% of solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "the sample of 4847 solar - type stars within 67pc contains only 24 multiple systems with a 3-tier hierarchy , but for none of them except hd  91962 are all three orbits known because the outer orbits have estimated periods of several thousand years . in the current version ] of the multiple star catalog @xcite we found four 3-tier hierarchies where all three orbits are known ( table  [ tab : msc ] ) . in those systems , the inner pairs have short orbital periods , presumably produced by inward migration . in the first system , hd  5408 ( hr  266 , ads  784 ) , the two outer orbits are",
    "nearly co - planar with periods of 83.1yr and 4.85yr ( period ratio 17.1 ) and eccentricities of 0.24 and 0.22 .",
    "the architecture of hd  91962 is therefore rare , but not unique .",
    "it may belong to a class of multiple systems that evolved in a viscous disk .",
    "the distinguishing features of this class are approximate co - planarity of the orbits , moderate period ratio on the order of 20 ( possibly in resonance ) , and small eccentricities .",
    "other members of this class , quadruple as well as triple , may be found among known multiple systems and discovered in the future .",
    "determination of accurate orbital elements will be essential in checking the co - planarity and resonance .",

    "the rare quadruple system hd  91962 gives interesting insights about its origin and , by extension , the origin of multiple stars in general .",
    "further rv monitoring will help to confirm the sign of the long - term rv trend , hence the co - planarity of a , b and aa , ab . precise speckle measurements of aa , ab with high cadence can be used to infer the orientation of the inner orbit aa1,aa2 .",
    "this can be done even better with long - baseline interferometers .",
    "direct resolution of the inner pair , for which we estimate @xmath63 mag and separation on the order of 20mas , will be difficult but not impossible .",
