    "<S> it is assumed@xcite that the radioactive decay of @xmath0ti powers the infrared , optical and uv emission of supernova remnants after the complete decay of @xmath1co and @xmath2co ( the isotopes that dominated the energy balance during the first three to four years after the explosion ) until the beginning of active interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding matter . </S>",

    "<S> european space agency , estec , keplerlaan 1 , 2200 ag noordwijk , the netherlands .    the only immediate way to determine the initial mass of @xmath10ti ( denoted @xmath11 ) in a supernova remnant is through its emission in the direct - escape lines at energies @xmath124.1 , 67.9 , 78.4 , 511 and 1,157 kev . </S>",
    "<S> this isotope decays according to the chain @xmath10ti@xmath13sc@xmath13ca , with a characteristic time of @xmath14 years ( ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> photons in the three x - ray lines , namely 4.1 , 67.9 and 78.4 kev , are emitted with efficiencies ( average numbers of photons per decay ) @xmath15% , 87.7% and 94.7% during the first stage of the decay , and photons in the @xmath5-ray lines , namely 511 and 1,157 kev , are produced with @xmath16% and 99.9% during the second very quick ( @xmath17 h ) stage . </S>",
    "<S> when the ejecta becomes transparent for hard - x - ray and @xmath5-ray lines ( typically at @xmath18 years ) , the corresponding fluxes can be estimated as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the distance to the remnant and @xmath21 is the proton mass . </S>",
    "<S> measurements@xcite of the 67.9- , 78.4- and 1,157-kev lines from casa have yielded the value @xmath22 : tentative detections of the 1,157-kev line from the vela junior remnant@xcite and the 4.1-kev line from the g1.9 + 0.3 remnant@xcite have been also reported , but they are more uncertain . assuming a value of @xmath11 similar to that in cas  a , we can expect the photon fluxes in these lines from supernova remnant ( snr ) 1987a ( @xmath23 kpc ) about @xmath24 years after the explosion to be about @xmath25 photons @xmath26 s@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this remnant was the first for which the x - ray and @xmath5-ray emission from the decay of @xmath28co and @xmath29co was detected@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral)@xcite invested considerable observing time in trying to detect these lines from snr1987a . the first observation was carried out in 2003 soon after the launch of integral . </S>",
    "<S> a number of important results have been obtained , including constraints on the luminosity of the stellar remnant@xcite , but the dedicated exposure ( @xmath30 ms ) was insufficient for the detection of the @xmath10ti lines . </S>",
    "<S> the next set of observations was carried out in 201011 with a total exposure of @xmath31 ms . </S>",
    "<S> figure1 presents the results of our analysis of all these data . </S>",
    "<S> images of the snr1987a field obtained with the ibis / isgri hard - x - ray telescope on board integral are shown in three energy bands , 4865 , 6582 and 8299 kev , which encompass the @xmath10ti lines at 67.9 and 78.4 kev . </S>",
    "<S> two known sources , the black - hole binary and the 50-ms crab - like pulsar psrb0540 - 69 , are seen in all images . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , there is an obvious excess at the position of snr1987a , but only in the energy band that includes the @xmath10ti lines . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the excess coincides within @xmath32 with that of snr1987a  a typical uncertainty for moderately bright sources ( the angular resolution of ibis is @xmath33 full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - noise ratio for this excess , @xmath34 ( related to the flux measured in both lines at once ) , corresponds to a rather small probability of detecting such an excess by chance , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of detecting a random excess with the same @xmath36 ratio at an arbitrary position in the whole @xmath37 ibis field of view is much higher ( it can be estimated as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of uncorrelated spots within the ibis field of view ; a ` spot ' is the area of the sky image that can be occupied by a single source ) . in reality </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of detecting the @xmath10ti lines by chance is even smaller than @xmath40 , because significant excesses were simultaneously detected at the position of snr1987a in the images accumulated in the narrow energy bands 62.773.2 and 73.283.7 kev . </S>",
    "<S> each of these bands contains one of the @xmath10ti lines and they are nearly independent in terms of the energy resolution of ibis / isgri , which is 8% fwhm at @xmath41 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 ratios measured for snr1987a in these images are respectively 3.0 and 3.1 , and the corresponding chance probabilities are @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined probability of detecting the @xmath10ti emission by chance is then equal to @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the hard - x - ray spectrum obtained with ibis / isgri from snr1987a is presented in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we fitted it using two lines of gaussian shape with fixed centroid energies , equal widths and self - consistent ( according to the @xmath10ti emission efficiencies ) normalizations . </S>",
    "<S> the flux measured in both lines at once , @xmath46 , corresponds to a value for initial amount of synthesized @xmath10ti of @xmath47 ( the uncertainty is purely statistical ) . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate can be slightly decreased if we assume the presence of some underlying continuum in the snr1987a spectrum  for example , in the form of a power law with a photon index of 2.1 ( a crab - like spectrum ) , which should describe the hard - x - ray emission well up to @xmath48 kev ( ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> its possible contribution at 1 kev , @xmath49 , coincides with the normalization of the non - thermal x - ray component in the snr1987a spectrum following from the xmm - newton observations in 2009@xcite . with such a component ( shown in fig.2 by a solid curve ) the flux in the lines decreases to @xmath50 , which may be translated to @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spi @xmath5-ray spectrometer on board integral observed snr1987a simultaneously with ibis / isgri in the 511- and 1,157-kev lines of @xmath10ti ; however , the smaller effective area and presence of strong background features at 511 and @xmath52 kev preclude their confident detection . </S>",
    "<S> the photon spectrum measured in the 1,1061,205-kev band is presented in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve shows the @xmath53 upper limit ( 90% confidence ) for the flux in the 1,157-kev gaussian line , namely @xmath54 s@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be converted to the limit for the amount of @xmath10ti , @xmath55 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curve in fig.3 shows the gaussian line corresponding to the value of @xmath11 measured with ibis / isgri .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of emission in the 67.9- and 78.4-kev lines allows us to measure directly the amount of radioactive @xmath10ti synthesized during the explosion , that is , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this amount formally exceeds by a factor of 1.5 to 2 the estimates based on theoretical simulations of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernova 1987a and on the infrared and ultraviolet data ( although the discrepancy represents only one standard deviation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath10ti may be produced either as a result of strong deviation from nuclear statistical equilibrium during the explosion ( so - called @xmath57-rich freeze - out)@xcite or as a result of incomplete si - burning in a thin shell surrounding the region of main energy release@xcite . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are not straightforward and many poorly known parameters ( for example , the mass of the collapsed core , the maximum temperature and density behind the shock wave , the neutron excess and the composition of the pre - supernova interior ) could affect the results . in this sense , the value of @xmath11 that we report here may be useful for studying explosive nucleosynthesis and physical conditions reached during the shock - wave passage in the ejecta .    </S>",
    "<S> we note finally that the shock interaction of the ejecta and the surrounding matter is responsible for the synchrotron emission observed at present from snr1987a in the radio- and soft - x - ray bands@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reprocessing of this emission in the ejecta is contributing to the late - time optical - infrared emission of snr1987a@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate of the power - law component in the spectrum of snr1987a may be translated to a @xmath58 upper limit for the luminosity of synchrotron emission of @xmath59 in the 2060 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be also considered as the limit for the luminosity of the stellar remnant ( pulsar or black hole ) harboured inside the ejecta .    _ </S>",
