    "the following discussion assumes that a fixed external current enters on one of the side surfaces and leaves on the opposite surface .",
    "the current is taken to be constant on the two surfaces .",

    "as the potential distribution is only defined up to a constant , it is convenient to require that the average of the potential distribution vanishes on the boundary surface @xmath30    @xmath31    if we assume that the current on the surface @xmath32 is square integrable , it is in the space    @xmath33    any change @xmath34 of a homogeneous conductivity distribution @xmath35 produces a corresponding change @xmath36 in the potential distribution @xmath37 .",

    "will be imaged as an object of conductivity 3 units .",
    "we will therefore not attempt to determine numerical values of the conductivity of the hidden objects but only existence and location of such objects .",
    "this restriction of the scope of the reconstruction will still yield useful results in applications such as mammography .    for the given experimental set - up we measure a change in potential @xmath43 , which we normalize so that it is in @xmath44 , which is defined in analogy to eq.([raute ] ) .",
    "we consider a base @xmath45 , which is complete and orthonormal in @xmath46 .",
    "it turns out to be useful to introduce in addition a set of functions @xmath47 ( not complete ) , which are defined on the full surface @xmath30 of the box , @xmath48 then , by eq.([freabl ] ) , the moments @xmath49 satisfy in linear approximation @xmath50    we introduce a linear operator @xmath51 acting on the change in conductivity @xmath52 through @xmath53 using @xmath54 the relation between @xmath52 and the associated change in potential @xmath55 reads    @xmath56    a natural choice for the base @xmath45 associated to the upper surface is @xmath57    where the index @xmath58 is replaced by two indices @xmath59 .",
    "the set of functions @xmath60 referring to the whole surface is then defined in accordance with eq.([defuns ] ) . to make use of eq.([freabl ] ) to calculate @xmath61 we need the potential @xmath62 resulting from an external current distribution @xmath63 and conductivity @xmath64 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that @xmath65    with the abbreviation @xmath66    if we define @xmath67 then eq.([opfisch ] ) can be written in the form    @xmath68    this is our main result .",
    "it is obvious from eq.([ads ] ) that the set @xmath69 is a complete orthogonal system in @xmath70 .",
    "we have thus explicitly constructed the singular system @xmath71 of the operator @xmath51 and its generalized inverse can be written down explicitly .",
    "the generalized or least square solution of eq.([ads ] ) is then simply given by @xmath72 this generalized solution is still not continuous in the data and must be regularized in a suitable manner .",
    "we employed for convenience mainly the method of truncating the singular values or truncating the indices @xmath59 in eq.([va ] ) .",
    "the latter procedure turns out to produce better images .",
    "the cut off values of the indices is determined by a version of the discrepancy principle , i.e. by requiring that the resolution implied by the fourier series eq.[spwa ] should not exceed the distance between the electrodes which measure the potential on the surface @xmath73 .",
    "we assume the latter constitutes the main source of the experimental error .",
    "it should be pointed out that we only reconstruct a three dimensional picture which is a projection on the set of functions @xmath74 .",
    "it is sufficient to view the image at @xmath75 , because the images for @xmath76 follow uniquely from the @xmath75 one and contain no additional information .",
    "we effectively see a two - dimensional image , which represents a kind of shadow of the object . for many purposes ( such as in cancer screening ) ,",
    "when one is only interested in the presence or absence of an object , this is sufficient information .",
    "as discussed above , the actual value of the object s conductivity can not be reconstructed quantitatively .    in fig.([bild1 ] ) and ( [ bild2 ] ) we present images obtained from synthetic data which were calculated for @xmath77 grid points on the plane @xmath73 .",

    "case ( a ) shows the image for two spheres of diameter @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively both at a distance @xmath79 from the surface and case ( b ) shows the image for two spheres of equal diameter at distance @xmath83 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "qualitatively the image gets larger and flatter as the object is moved away from the measuring plate .",
    "in addition the image gets brighter ( but not larger ! ) as the object gets larger .",
    "the same effect is observed when the conductivity is increased .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish volume- from conductivity effects .",
    "this is true as long as the objects are small or not to close to the surface , as they effectively behave as dipoles ( see section 4 ) . given additional information , e.g. that the object s conductivity is constant and of a given magnitude , it may be possible to quantify this observation and obtain a full three dimensional image of the object .",
    "this is exemplified in the next section .",

    "the boundary value problem for a current distribution @xmath90 can be defined as follows , @xmath91 equation ( [ difrac3 ] ) guarantees the continuity of the potential while ( [ difrac4 ] ) describes current conservation .",
    "these two equations determine the boundary conditions on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the other three equations represent the well - known boundary value problem of the laplace equation . the neumann boundary condition ( [ difrac2 ] )",
    "is given in ( [ kr1],[kr2],[kr3 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath92 one obtains @xmath93 , the solution of ( [ phic ] ) .    for the case of a small sphere of constant conductivity and not too close to the surface @xmath94",
    "the change in potential @xmath36 is given by the dipole term , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the coordinate of the centre of the sphere , and    @xmath97    this result can be derived by noting that our boundary value problem is equivalent to that of a dielectric sphere in a uniform electric field",
    ".    the variation of @xmath98 with @xmath99 shows quite clearly the limited sensitivity of eit to changes of conductivity . in practical reconstructions @xmath100 can hardly be distinguished from @xmath101    the potential @xmath102 still does not satisfy the neumann boundary condition ( [ difrac2 ] ) on @xmath32 .",
    "this problem can , in principle , be solved by an infinite number of image dipoles .",
    "we checked that the series converges rapidly .",
    "for the case @xmath103 , i.e. the case of two infinite plates , the sum takes on the simple form :    latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\delta \\phi ( \\vec{x } ) & = -\\alpha r^{3}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } \\left\\ { \\frac{% \\nabla \\phi _ { 0}\\cdot ( x - x_{0},y - y_{0},z-(2nc - z_{0}))^{t}}{%    & + \\left . \\frac{\\nabla \\phi _ { 0}\\cdot ( x - x_{0},y - y_{0},z-(-2nc+z_{0}))^{t}}{%     the knowledge of @xmath36 allows to calculate the generalized inverse according to eq.([va ] ) . for rough estimates and when the sphere is not to close to the surface , the image dipoles can be neglected . as the conductivity of the sphere",
    "is assumed to be known , eq.([20 ] ) can be used to obtain an estimate of the position and the volume of the sphere . as a test we measure the synthetic data on the surface @xmath73 by @xmath77 electrodes .",
    "given the rough knowledge of the coordinates @xmath105 of the centre of the sphere , we fit @xmath36 of eq.([20 ] ) plus the background potential @xmath37 to data taken on neighboring electrodes . as a typical example",
    ", we find for data afflicted with 10% multiplicatice uniform error , the following results : @xmath106 ( instead of @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 ( instead of @xmath109 ) .    in realistic applications the object to be detected will in general",
    "not be spherical .",
    "nonetheless one may obtain rough information on size and depth of the location of the object by assuming a spherical shape and applying the analysis above .",
    "we have presented in this note an electric impedance imaging system based on a specific simple geometry of the device which guarantees a uniform current distribution in the case of constant conductivity . if we further impose the condition that only a single object ( or possible a small number of objects ) is to be detected",

    "to test of the effectiveness of the method , we create synthetic data which can be afflicted with errors .",
