    "we remark that for increasing values of the detuning @xmath4 it becomes increasingly difficult to numerically track the cs snaking branches .",
    "we believe this is not a numerical artifact , but rather that the snaking structure becomes more complex for @xmath40 hindering the numerical tracking of these cs branches ( although solutions with multiple css seem to persist ) .",
    "understanding the detailed snaking structure for high values of @xmath4 is beyond the scope of this paper and it will addressed elsewhere .    in figure [ profiles ] , we show typical profiles of the css that exist in an optical cavity described by the lle . as mentioned before ,",

    "all frequency modes present in the corresponding frequency comb are now separated by @xmath44 ( or equivalently 7 fsr units ) . although we have used the same distance @xmath43 to denote the separation between various peaks in the pattern , we remark that this should not necessarily be the case , as this might vary a bit depending on the exact cavity length .",

    "in the next section , we will analyze the spatial dynamics of the homogeneous steady state solutions as this will provide valuable information about where one can expect stable css to be found .",

    "thus , the hopf bifurcation line emerges from the gg point , and although the hopf line looks like it terminates perpendicularly to @xmath100 , the inset in figure [ fig::temporal_dynamics ] shows that it in fact approaches the gg point in a tangential manner . for higher values of the detuning more complex oscillatory behavior can be found as well , such as period-2 oscillations , period-3 oscillations , period - n oscillations and eventually temporal chaos @xcite .",
    "an example of such temporal chaos is given in figure [ fig::chaos ] where one can see that the cs remains localized , but its envelope is oscillating in a chaotic way in time .",
    "likewise , the envelope of the corresponding frequency comb will change chaotically in time . for higher values of the pump power @xmath3",
    "one also encounters large regions with a different type of chaotic response , called spatio - temporal chaos or optical turbulence , as denoted by the letter c in figure [ fig::temporal_dynamics ] .",
    "an example of such chaotic behavior is shown in figure [ fig::chaos2 ] , where it is clear that one can no longer distinguish clear localized css .",
    "instead the entire cavity is oscillating in a chaotic manner .",
    "the envelope of the corresponding frequency comb is no longer smooth but has significant variations of the amplitude from mode to mode due to the many different wavelengths participating in the dynamics , and it is much flatter .",
    "this regime is the one dominating the parameter space for large input powers .",
    "it can be reached directly from the hss crossing the line @xmath35 ( figure [ fig::temporal_dynamics ] ) or through the instabilities of a cs for powers around the @xmath101 line .",
    "the spatiotemporal chaotic regime coexists with the hss for a range of input powers below @xmath35 .",
    "the exact scenario that leads to such spatio - temporal chaos coming from a cs needs further characterization , but is seems closely related to the belyakov - devaney ( bd ) line where the oscillatory feature associated to the spatial eigenvalues of the hss is lost and the tails of the cs approach the hss in a monotonic manner .",
    "the origin of the temporal chaos observed for higher values of detuning is also currently unknown , but might originate from the unfolding of the gg point @xcite .",
    "these two points will be studied in more detail elsewhere .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of the lle with one transverse dimension in relation with the generation of frequency combs .",
    "many different dynamical regimes , going from a single peak stationary cs to spatio - temporal chaos , are available by changing the input pump and detuning as summarized in figure [ fig::temporal_dynamics ] . on the one hand",
    "the lle finds applications to many different nonlinear optical cavities , and on the other hand it is a prototypical model for the study of cavity solitons",
    ". therefore many of the conclusions concerning the generation of frequency combs from the different dynamical regimes are applicable to other systems displaying css .",
    "due to the fact that many different dynamical regimes are supported in the lle , this model offers several different possibilities for the generation of frequency combs .",
    "in particular the coexistence of multiple solutions differing only in the number of peaks circulating in the cavity offers the possibility to tune the shape of the comb without changing the parameters of the system . to target particular solutions ,",
    "suitable initial conditions must be seeded in the cavity though .    beyond regimes of stationary css , in very wide parameter range",
    "the lle displays dynamical regimes , going from regularly oscillating css to chaotic css and spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "since these regimes appear for higher values of the input pump amplitude and the detuning , they have a much broader bandwidth .",
    "the amplitude of the fourier modes is , however , not constant +",
