    "resonance ( vector meson , etc . ) production and the modification to their properties by the medium are important signals of phase transition in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "leptonic decay channels of vector mesons have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "their dominant decay branches to hadrons , however , are less extensively studied , partially due to the final state interactions of decay products , the large background from the abundantly produced hadrons ( @xmath9 s ) and the broad mass width .",
    "this is especially true for mesons like @xmath10 and @xmath11 whose daughters consist of @xmath12 s and the decay widths are 130mev and 50mev , respectively . on the other hand , due to their short lifetime which is comparable to the lifetime of the dense matter",
    ", their measured properties may be sensitive to the lifetime of the dense matter .",
    "for example , model calculations show that the @xmath13 ratio is sensitive to the mass modification  @xcite of particles in the medium and the dynamic evolution of the source . from detailed comparison of yields and @xmath5 distributions of resonances and other particles",
    ", we may be able to distinguish different freeze - out conditions  @xcite .",
    "simulation has shown that we should be able to reconstruct these resonances with good statistics at rhic energies through the mixed - event method because the significance of the signal rises with the square root of number of events  @xcite . however , other effects from flow and detector complicate the situation when the signal is less than 1% of the combinatorics .",
    "we can also apply the same mixed - event methos to reconstruct lambda , l - bar , and ks which are complementary to those from secondary vertex identification .",
    "the main detector for star is the time projection chamber(tpc )  @xcite allowing measurement of track multiplicity and momenta of the tracks .",
    "the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) are used to define a minimum bias trigger and an additional scintillating central trigger barrel ( ctb ) to select the top 14% central events  @xcite . in this analysis , we take advantage of star tpc s large acceptance ( @xmath14 ) and high efficiency ( @xmath15 ) at mid - rapidity ( @xmath16 ) to overcome the large combinatoric background .    data were taken in the summer of 2000 for au+au collisions with @xmath2 gev  @xcite .",
    "there are 307k central and 160k minimum bias au+au nuclear interactions surviving the cuts described below and used in this analysis .",
    "event vertex is required to be within @xmath17 along the beam direction of the center of the tpc for uniform acceptance in the range we study  @xcite .",
    "particles are selected based on momenta measured from track curvature in the tpc at 0.25 t solenoidal magnetic field , track quality and particle identification from energy loss in the tpc .",
    "the cuts used depend on the daughter particle species . since @xmath18 from @xmath4 and @xmath19 decays are particles originating from the interaction point , we select tracks with @xmath20 cm where dca is the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex . for @xmath21 from @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 , we select tracks with @xmath25 cm .",
    "the purity of the pid selection is good only for low momentum .",
    "for example , for @xmath26 gev/@xmath27 , more than 80% of the produced particles have de / dx consistent with being a kaon .",
    "in addition , we require that pseudorapidity of the daughters @xmath28 and opening angle between the daughters @xmath29 for @xmath4 and @xmath30 for @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "fig.[fig : lambda ] and fig.[fig : phi ] shows the mixed - event subtracted mass plots of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath19 . from these distributions",
    ", we fit the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mass peaks and calculate the @xmath5 and rapidity integrated ratio of @xmath8 for minimum - bias events .",
    "the @xmath5 and rapidity range of the parent particle are @xmath31 gev/@xmath27 and @xmath16 in addition to the cuts on daughter particles . in this calculation",
    ", the efficiencies of @xmath22 and @xmath23 cancel out due to the cylindal symmetry of the tpc and its magnetic field .",
    "this result is consistent with the result of @xmath32 from topological method  @xcite .",
    "it shows that there is net strange baryon in the middle rapidity .",
    "we observe about 0.26 reconstructed @xmath19 per central event with good statistics from @xmath33 ( b.r .",
    "analysis on @xmath5 spectra and centrality dependence is under way .",
    "@xmath34 and its antiparticle @xmath35 ( b.r .",
    "67% ) can be reconstructed from the charged kaons and pions .",
    "the invariant mass of every @xmath18 pair from the same event and a pool of mixed events is calculated and entered in the same - event spectra and the mixed - event spectra",
    "usually three or more events are `` mixed '' with each other in same centrality bin and close in vertex position ( @xmath36 ) . from the 300k 14% central events , there are more than @xmath37 pairs of the selected kaons and pions .",
    "substantial computation is required to calculate both same - event spectra and mixed - event spectra .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath38 after background subtraction is shown in fig.[fig : kstar ] for 300k 14% central events .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio before background subtraction is about 1/1000 for central events , 1/50 for peripheral au+au interactions and 1/4 for pp at isr  @xcite .",
    "however , the important parameter of the significance of the signal is not s / n but the ratio of signal to the fluctuation in the background @xmath39 .",
    "we observe a @xmath40 @xmath4 signal above the background fluctuation and the raw count of @xmath4 is 2.7 per central event .",
    "similarly , a @xmath41 @xmath42 signal is observed above the @xmath43 combinatoric background with the raw count of 2.6 per central event .",
    "the masses and widths are measured to be @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath45 , @xmath47 @xmath45 and @xmath48 @xmath45 .",
    "these are consistent with the values of @xmath49 @xmath45 and @xmath50 @xmath45 in the particle data book  @xcite .",
    "linear and exponential shapes are used to fit the residual background under the signal as shown in fig.[fig : kstar ] .",
    "the difference is about 20% which is used to estimate the systematic error of the measurements . in order to get the yields",
    ", we have to calculate the detector acceptance and efficiency .",
    "this is done by embedding geant simulated kaons and pions to the real events which then go through the full reconstruction chain  @xcite . the overall acceptance and efficiency factor @xmath51 depends on centrality , @xmath5 and rapidity of the parent and daughter particles .",
    "@xmath51 changes from under 20% for @xmath52 to above 50% for @xmath53 gev/@xmath27 . in current studies",
    ", there is only one integrated @xmath5 and rapidity bin at each centrality from the data analysis .",
    "an inverse slope of @xmath54 and flat in rapidity are assumed for @xmath4 to calculate the correction factor @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath55 for central events and increases for lower multiplicity events .",
    "however , because the efficiency increases with @xmath5 , an assumed @xmath56 results in @xmath57 .",
    "we take @xmath3 yield ratio and compare the results for different centralities and with those from pp at isr  @xcite and @xmath58 at lep  @xcite .",
    "@xmath59 is the corrected total primary negatively charged hadrons with @xmath60 and @xmath61 gev/@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary results as shown in fig.[fig : kpi ] are @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( top 14% ) and @xmath68 ( top 5% ) for four centrality bins .",
    "errors are statistical only and the systematic errors are estimated to be about 25% .",
    "these results are to be compared with @xmath69 from @xmath58 at @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 from pp at @xmath72 gev .",
    "we observe that the @xmath3 does not change much from low multiplicity to high multiplicity and is compatible to @xmath73 in elementary particle collisions .",
    "it is noticed that the composition of @xmath59 has on the order of 80% @xmath74 and the @xmath59 per participant pair in central au+au has an increase of 30% from @xmath75 collision at same energies  @xcite .",
    "this implies about 50% increase of the @xmath4 per participant pair .",
    "a better comparison could be made for @xmath13 since they have same quark content and only differ in spins . by simple spin counting ,",
    "the vector meson to meson ( pseudoscalar+vector ) ratio is @xmath76 .",
    "however , due to the mass difference between these two states , @xmath77 is much smaller from elementary collisions .",
    "preliminary comparison indicates that the @xmath13 of @xmath78 in central au+au at rhic is between the results of @xmath79 at isr and @xmath80 at lep .",
    "the preliminary kaon results are from  @xcite",
    ".    however , since the lifetime of @xmath4 is short ( @xmath81 ) and is comparable to the time scale of the evolution of the system , we need to take into account the surviving possibility of @xmath4 when comparing the results from au+au with those from pp . for example , during the time @xmath82 between chemical freeze - out and kinetic freeze - out , the daughter @xmath18 from @xmath4 decay may rescatter and the @xmath4 may not be reconstructed . a simple model simulation which assumes that a @xmath4 decaying before kinetic freeze out can not be reconstructed experimentally shows that @xmath82 can only be on the order of a few fm with the current measured @xmath13 ratio .",
    "the consistency of the measured masses and widths of @xmath4 to the pdg values seems to indicate that there is no small angle elastic scattering undergone by daughter kaon and pion when they emergy from the dense matter . in reality , the surviving possibility depends on @xmath82 , source size and @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "this may give us a unique tool to measure the time of the evolution of the system .    in conclusion , we observe @xmath83 from first - year data at rhic taken with the star tpc .",
    "the measured @xmath3 are compared with @xmath73 from pp at isr and @xmath58 at lep .",
    "although data indicate slight enhancement of @xmath4 production per participant pair from pp to au+au , @xmath13 seems to decrease from pp to au+au .",
    "a more detailed study including momentum distributions should be done with improved statistical and systematic precision from future au+au and pp runs at rhic .",
    "we plan to measure the @xmath5 spectra of @xmath4 and @xmath19 from this data set and future data sets .",
    "we will explore the feasibility of measuring many other resonances .",
