    "in 1996 , louis kauffman introduced a generalization of classical links to stable embeddings of a disjoint union of circles in a thickened compact oriented surface by using the notion of an oriented gauss code  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a link is shown in figure  [ fig : vrefoil ] .",
    "@xmath1    kauffman was motivated in part by the desire to allow all oriented gauss codes to be associated with diagrams of links .",
    "when the surface being thickened is a sphere , the links are classical , however there are virtual links that are not classical links .",
    "since by a result of kuperberg  @xcite , virtual links have unique irreducible representatives , virtual link theory is a proper extension of classical links .",
    "many invariants of classical links formally extend to virtual links through the use of their diagrams by ignoring the virtual crossings , although the resulting invariant may have different properties than those of the classical version .",
    "a virtual link can be formally associated with a group through a wirtinger presentation obtained from any diagram for the link .",
    "however , the group of a virtual link may not be residually finite , so it may not be the fundamental group of any three - manifold  @xcite .",
    "a virtual link has a jones polynomial , but the classical relation between the polynomial s exponents and the number of link components only holds if the link has a two - colorable diagram as was shown by n.  kamada  @xcite .      in 1990 , yu .",
    "v.  drobotukhina introduced the study of links in real projective space as a generalization of links in the three - sphere  @xcite . on the left of figure  [ fig : twofoil ] ,    @xmath1    a non - trivial projective link is shown using the 3-ball model of projective space .",
    "drobotukhina showed how to create diagrams of projective links in 2-disks , and she extended reidemeister moves on planar diagrams to include moves across the boundary of the disks . on the right of figure",
    "[ fig : twofoil ] , is shown a diagram of the link in the projective plane .",
    "drobotukhina showed that projective links admit a jones polynomial invariant and studied some of its properties .",
    "we introduce _ links in oriented thickenings _ as stable ambient isotopy classes of oriented circles in oriented three - manifolds that are orientation @xmath0-bundles over closed but not necessarily orientable or connected surfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : onefoil ]    @xmath2    shows a onefoil knot in a thickened klein bottle on the left .",
    "the thickened klein bottle is shown as a cube with identification of its sides with the double arrows with a @xmath3 turn , and likewise for the sides with the single arrow . a diagram for the onefoil",
    "is shown on the right of the figure , with the bars on the edges showing that paths around those edges are orientation - reversing in a projection of the link on the embedded klein bottle .    by considering destabilization of the oriented thickening along annuli and mbius bands in the complement of the link",
    ", we get an extension to links in oriented thickenings of a result of greg kuperberg  @xcite for virtual links .",
    "[ thm : unique_destabilization ] links in oriented thickenings have a unique irreducible representative .",
    "thus we may speak of the minimum euler genus of a link in oriented thickening .",
    "the following is an immediate corollary :    links in their minimum euler genus oriented thickenings that are equivalent through stabilizations are equivalent without stabilizations .",
    "in particular , classical , projective , and virtual link theories inject in the theory of link in oriented thickenings .    we define _",
    "twisted link diagrams _ as marked generic planar curves , where the markings identify the usual classical crossings , kauffman s virtual crossings , and now bars on edges .",
    "we extend the kauffman - reidemeister moves for virtual links to account for the new markings by including the twisted moves described in figure  [ fig : reidemeister ] .",
    "* classical moves : * + @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 + * virtual extension : * + @xmath7",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 + * twisted extension : * + @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    since there are three classical reidemeister moves labeled r1 to r3 and four virtual reidemeister moves labeled v1 to v4 , the three twisted reidemeister moves labeled t1 to t3 brings the total number of moves to ten . figure  [ fig : ex1 ]",
    "@xmath12 @xmath7 @xmath5    shows an example of transforming the classical diagram of an unknot through each of the three classes of the extended reidemeister moves .",
    "we will see that the leftmost diagram is for an unknot in a thickened sphere while the rightmost diagram is for a curve in a thickened klein bottle .",
    "we have the following :    [ thm : link_diagrams ] links in oriented thickenings correspond to classes of twisted link diagrams given by ambient isotopy of the diagram along with extended kauffman - reidemeister moves",
    ".    therefore , we will refer to links in oriented thickenings as _",
    "twisted links_.      we use a state sum to define the _ twisted jones polynomial _ of a twisted link as an element of @xmath14 $ ] , where the @xmath15 variable counts the number of circles with an odd number of bars in a given state of the diagram .",
    "we have the following :    [ thm : jones_polynomial ] the twisted jones polynomial is an invariant of twisted links .",
    "if a twisted link diagram is that of a virtual link , then its twisted jones polynomial is @xmath16 times its virtual jones polynomial .",
    "if we let @xmath17 in the twisted jones polynomial , we can always divide the result by @xmath16 , and then we get an extension of the jones polynomial to twisted links .    if the polynomial of a twisted link has an @xmath15 variable , then the link is not a virtual link .",
    "it is easy to see that if a link has an odd number of bars on its edges , then we can factor one @xmath15 variable from its polynomial . on the right of figure  [ fig : onefoil ]",
    "is a onefoil knot in a thickened klein bottle , and its twisted jones polynomial is : @xmath18 which does not have an @xmath15 factor .",
    "also its jones polynomial is trivial .",
    "however , a link may have an @xmath15-free twisted jones polynomial and not be virtual , for the knot in figure  [ fig : t1212 ]        has twisted jones polynomial @xmath19 which is @xmath16 times its jones polynomial .",
    "this example is noteworthy because while the knot is in a thickening of a projective plane , this diagram in the projective plane is two - colorable .",
    "in fact , we have the following .    [ thm : link_two - colorable ] if a twisted link has a two - colorable diagram , then its twisted jones polynomial is @xmath20 times its jones polynomial .",
    "again , the converse of this theorem is not true since the knot in figure  [ fig : torus1212 ]        is a virtual link diagram in a torus and has the same twisted jones polynomial as the knot in figure  [ fig : t1212 ] , but it does not have a two - colorable diagram because the exponents of its jones polynomial are not a multiple of four . by a theorem of naoko kamada",
    "@xcite , if a virtual link has a two - colorable diagram , then its jones polynomial s exponents are multiples of four if the link has an odd number of components , and multiples of four plus two if the link has an even number of components .",
    "let @xmath21 be a virtual link .",
    "kauffman defines an invariant of virtual links which he calls the _ group of the virtual link _ , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "this invariant is calculated from any diagram for @xmath21 , by letting the arcs of the diagram between undercrossings be the generators , ignoring virtual crossings , and formally applying the wirtinger algorithm to the diagram to create a presentation of the group .",
    "this group is also called the _ upper group of the virtual link _ , and when the generators are arcs between overcrossings , the group is called the _ lower group of the virtual link_.    because the group of a link ignores the bars on the edges , it fails to be invariant with respect to move t3 .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : trefoilt3 ]        shows a trefoil on which a t3 move has been performed , and its group is trivial . in this case",
    ", we can apply a modified wirtinger algorithm that defines two generators for every end of an edge in the underlying graph , four relations at every crossing , and two relations for every edge , and we define the _ twisted link group _ of the link diagram to be the group associated to the presentation .",
    "we have the following :    [ thm : link_twisted_group ] the twisted link group of a link diagram is an invariant of the link .",
    "it is immediate from the definition of the twisted link group that when a twisted link is virtual , its group is a free product of its upper and lower groups .    the knots in figure  [ fig : t1212 ] and figure  [ fig : torus1212 ] have identical twisted jones polynomial , but different twisted link groups .",
    "the knot in figure  [ fig : t1212 ] has a twisted link group with ( simplified ) presentation : @xmath23 which has @xmath24 in its center .",
    "the knot in figure  [ fig : torus1212 ] has a twisted link group which is a free product of its upper and lower groups , and since these are both isomorphic to the integers , the twisted link group has a trivial center .",
    "however , the twisted link group is not necessarily better than the twisted jones polynomial at distinguishing knots .",
    "the knot in figure  [ fig : onefoil ] and the unknot have different twisted jones polynomials , but identical twisted link groups .",
    "the twisted link group of the onefoil is a free group on two generators , as is the twisted link group of an unknot .",
    "but the twisted jones polynomial of the onefoil is : @xmath25 so the twisted jones polynomial and the twisted link group contain different information about the link .",
    "the topological interpretation of the twisted link group is an open problem . in particular ,",
    "its relationship with the fundamental group of the complement of some realization of the twisted link with collapsed boundary is not as straightforward as in the virtual case  @xcite , as some examples have shown that they are not always equal .      to the memory of jerome p.  levine for his keen intellect , attentive kindness and boundless generosity .",
    "in 1990 , yu .  v.  drobotukhina introduced the study of links in real projective space as a generalization of links in the three - sphere  @xcite .",
    "drobotukhina showed how to create diagrams of projective links in a 2-disk representation of a projective plane , and she extended reidemeister moves on planar diagrams to include moves across the boundary of the disks . on the right of figure",

    "figure  [ fig : preidemeister ]    @xmath26 @xmath27    shows the extension of the reidemeister moves to deal with passing through the boundary of the disk .",
    "the strands involved in the moves are shown with different thickness to emphasize the effects of passing through the orientation - reversing boundary of the 2-disk .",
    "if a projective link can be isotoped to a link in the affine part of projective space , then it corresponds to a link in the three - sphere . in other papers , drobotukhina classified non - trivial projective links with diagrams with up to six crossings  @xcite as well as projective montesinos links  @xcite .",
    "an _ oriented gauss code _ is a double occurrence collection of sequences of symbols with a direction of traversal for each sequence and whose symbols are accompanied by writhe ( @xmath28 ) and height ( @xmath29 ) marks with the restriction that both occurrences of the same symbol have the same writhe and different heights .",

    "@xmath31    in the figure , the oriented gauss code is presented left - right , the crossing numbers are assigned to reflect the order in which they are encountered , and the lowercase letters @xmath32 represent segments of the code in between which the fragments are embedded .    kauffman associated every oriented gauss code with a planar link diagram by the usual graph theory approach of allowing drawings in the plane where some of the crossings are deemed not to occur in the diagram .",
    "these crossings are called _ virtual _ and do not have writhe or height . a virtual link diagram for gauss code @xmath30",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : torus1212 ] . in the diagram ,",
    "the virtual crossing is circled , and the writhe is obtained by the usual right - hand rule .",
    "kauffman identified an extension of the reidemeister moves on classical link diagrams to moves on link diagrams with virtual crossings .",
    "some of these are illustrated in figure  [ fig : reidemeister ] where seven of the allowed virtual moves are shown , one for each class of reidemeister move .",
    "three of the moves involve only classical crossings , three of the moves involve only virtual crossings , and one of the moves involves two virtual crossings and one real crossing",
    ". note that the two obvious 3-crossing moves that involve two real crossings and one virtual crossing are forbidden because including them makes all links are equivalent to unlinks  @xcite .",
    "kauffman extended many link invariants , such as the group , quandle , to virtual links by the simple approach of ignoring the virtual crossings .",
    "abstract links over orientable surfaces were introduced in knot theory by naoko kamada and seiichi kamada  @xcite .",
    "they are regular neighborhoods of links in surfaces , and are equivalent to virtual links which they anticipated .",
    "however , similar presentations for graphs embedded in surfaces have long been common in topological graph theory  @xcite .      in 1985",
    ", vaughan jones announced the creation of a new polynomial invariant of links  @xcite .",
    "this invariant encoded different information about links than the older alexander polynomial .",
    "this invariant was soon generalized to the homfly polynomial , which generalized both the jones and alexander polynomials . in 1987 , louis kauffman introduced a state - sum model for the calculation of the jones polynomial  @xcite .    in 1990 , yu .",
