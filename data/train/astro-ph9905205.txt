    "however , further detailed calculations have shown that finite abundances of metals can be supported against gravitational settling by the net transfer of upward momentum from the intense radiation field to the heavy element ions via their line transitions ( e.g. vauclair et al .",
    "@xcite and most recently chayer et al .",
    "in contrast , similar calculations have demonstrated that helium can not be radiatively levitated in observable quantities in all but the hottest objects , due to a relatively small number of bound - bound transitions , and should sink out of the photosphere on a time - scale of days ( vennes et al .",

    "as a do cooled , residual hydrogen in its atmosphere was expected to float to the surface forming a layer of sufficient thickness that spectroscopic traces of helium were eliminated , at least in the optical waveband .",
    "the white dwarf would transform first into a dao , then a da . in either case",
    "it was expected to have a chemically stratified atmosphere where a thin layer of hydrogen over - lies a predominantly helium envelope in diffusive equilibrium . at @xmath5 ,",
    "convective mixing would then dredge helium back into the optical photosphere , effectively returning it to the helium rich cooling sequence .",
    "many observations could be accounted for with this evolutionary hypothesis , e.g. the apparent absence of das with @xmath6 and the do / db gap between @xmath7 , a region of the cooling sequence where no helium rich objects are observed .",
    "however , doubt was cast on this interpretation by the detailed optical study of a large sample of daos by bergeron et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the theoretically predicted stratified atmosphere , they found for many objects in their sample that the observed 4686  heii line profile was reproduced significantly better by a model in which helium was homogeneously mixed into a predominantly hydrogen atmosphere .",

    "for example , periodic variations in the soft x - ray / euv flux from the da2+kv pre - cv system ( jensen et al .",

    "recently , time resolved studies of a zeeman split 1286  siiii line believed to be formed in the photosphere of the white dwarf have revealed a variation in its equivalent width on the soft x - ray / euv and optical period ( sion et al .",

    ", this excessive abundance of helium , @xmath451 dex above the radiative levitation prediction , is maintained by a balance between the accretion of helium into and the gravitational settling of helium out of the white dwarf photosphere and it is possible to obtain a crude estimate of the accretion rate by solving equation 1 ( sion & starrfield @xcite ) .",
    "however , such an estimate may be rather inaccurate for several reasons .",
    "for instance , in our calculation it is assumed that the relative abundance of elements in the incoming material have solar values , although it is possible that a slowly rotating weakly magnetic hot white dwarf preferentially accretes certain elements ( alcock & illarionov @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the size of the area of the photosphere onto which the material is accreted is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , noting the following , it should be possible to eliminate the latter difficulty and obtain a rough lower limit to the accretion rate .",
    "the spectroscopic signature of a given abundance of helium in the photosphere may be reproduced by models making various assumptions about the abundance and distribution of this helium .",
    "for example , a uniform distribution can be assumed over the entire area of the visible hemisphere , or a higher abundance can be assumed over a smaller region , as was shown earlier .",
    "in fact , it is found from modelling and equation 1 , where @xmath46 is the mass accretion rate , a , the accretion surface area , @xmath47 the mass density at formation depth of the heii line used to measure the abundance and v the diffusion velocity relative to the centre of mass , also at the line formation depth , that the minimum accretion rate occurs for a uniform distribution of helium .",

    "we conclude , that although most likely has a hydrogen layer mass greater than @xmath54m@xmath9  now , it may have been almost completely stripped of a hydrogen layer when it emerged from the ce phase of evolution as initially proposed by burleigh et al .",

    "however , by assuming that an edge or line blend would be visible if predicted to be larger than twice the s / n of the data , the euv spectrum can be used to set an upper limit of log ( fe / h ) @xmath58 on the iron abundance . in the atmosphere of an accreting white dwarf such as , where the elemental diffusion time - scales are very much shorter than the evolutionary time - scale , the elemental abundances should reach an equilibrium somewhere between those of the incoming material and the radiative levitation values ( e.g vennes et al .",

    ", the local number density of civ was calculated . by integrating along the line of sight",
    "an estimate for the civ column was obtained .",
    "for the chosen mass - loss rates the predicted column was found to lie in the range n(civ)@xmath96 .",
    "a mass - loss rate of @xmath97 should produce n(civ)@xmath98 consistent with the observational lower limit .",
    "mullan ( @xcite ) reports that a detection of the inactive barnard s star at @xmath99 has been interpreted as free - free emission originating in a mass - loss wind of @xmath100 .",
    "hence , it also seems plausible that these absorption features may be formed in a photoionized wind from the red dwarf .",
    "furthermore , at the observed velocity , wind material would be moving towards the white dwarf and possibly accreting onto it , consistent with the wind accretion model cited to explain the euve data .",
    "it has been demonstrated that _ all _ of the helium in the optical , uv and euv spectra of , and most probably heavy elements too , are likely accreted into the atmosphere from the wind of the dm companion .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the non - uniform spatial distribution of euv opacity in the white dwarf photosphere .",
    "it has been found that even at the lower limiting rate of accretion , the white dwarf may well have gained its entire observable atmosphere from the wind of the secondary in the time since it emerged from the ce phase of evolution .",
    "furthermore , the non - uniformity has allowed an estimate of the rotation period of the white dwarf ( @xmath101days ) to be made .",
    "the photospheric iron abundance is at least a factor 10 lower than predicted by a simple balance between gravitational settling and the opposing upward pressure of the radiation field . along with the rather lower than expected accretion rate ,",
    "this has been interpreted as due to the possible presence of a selective mass - loss wind .",
    "several possible origins for weak non - photospheric civ lines observed in ghrs spectra of have been examined .",
    "although the line velocities are consistent with a formation in the lism , the column density may be rather larger than expected .",
    "alternatively , we have shown that this civ may reside in photoionized gas in close proximity to the white dwarf .",
    "this may take the form of either residual ce material surrounding the binary or in a putative wind from the secondary star .",
    "finally , circumstantial evidence has been presented which argues against a circumbinary disk as responsible for the unusual n(hi)/n(hei)@xmath102 along this line of sight .",
    "instead , it has been shown that it is more likely due to an extended region of ionized gas lying in the direction of the cma ism tunnel ."
