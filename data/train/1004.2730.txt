    "radio pulsars are rotating , magnetized neutron stars ( nss ) emitting radio beams from magnetic poles .",
    "their masses are in the range of @xmath3 , radii @xmath4 km , densities @xmath5 and surface values of the dipolar magnetic field are around @xmath6 gauss .",
    "presently there are 1864 radio pulsars with their spin periods covering a wide range 1.39 ms @xmath7 11.78 s. this number is increasing quite rapidly after the first serendipitous discovery in 1967 by jocelyn bell , a graduate student in cambridge @xcite .",
    "pulsars are believed to be born with spin period @xmath8 s which increases very slowly with time ( at the rate of @xmath9 ) as their rotational energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic energy .",
    "millisecond spin periods are explained as a result of spin - up process , which occurs when a neutron star has a normal star as its binary companion and accretes matter from the companion ( at its red giant phase ) causing transfer of angular momentum .",
    "depending upon the evolution of the companion , the resultant millisecond pulsar can be either isolated or a member of a binary system . in this article",
    "we concentrate on binary pulsars and discuss how the knowledge of their orbital parameters help us to understand the structure , formation , evolution and dynamic history of pulsars . as an example , binary millisecond pulsars are expected to be in circular orbits as tidal coupling during the accretion phase lead to orbit circularization .",
    "but if there is no history of accretion phase , the orbit of the binary pulsar can be eccentric because of the asymmetric kick imparted to the pulsar during its birth in a supernova .",
    "a millisecond pulsar binary can also have an eccentric orbit if it experiences interactions with other near - by stars ( which is possible in dense stellar environments like globular clusters ) or if it is a member of a hierarchical triple .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention here that in addition to radio wavelengths , pulsars emit in x - rays and/or gamma rays too .",
    "but radio pulsars are the most useful astronomical objects firstly because the underlying neutron stars are more stable than in the case of x - ray pulsars which have episodically varying accretion torques ; secondly high sensitivities of radio telescopes and data analysis software make it possible to determine their spin periods very accurately .",
    "moreover , for radio pulsars in binary systems ( @xmath10 of presently known radio pulsars are in binary systems ) , it is possible to determine the mass of the pulsar and its companion , size and shape of the orbit @xmath11 by modelling keplerian and post - keplerian parameters . such accurate determination of those parameters are difficult for x - ray pulsars at present .",
    "that is why we concentrate only on binary radio pulsars when we try to use the knowledge about their orbital parameters to understand the properties of pulsars .",
    "the first binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 was discovered in 1974 at arecibo observatory by r. hulse and j. h. taylor @xcite which is a 59 ms pulsar having orbital period 0.323 days and orbital eccentricities 0.671 .",
    "interestingly , its @xmath12 mass companion star is most probably another neutron star @xmath0 the first discovered binary pulsar is also the first discovered double neutron star ( candidate ) system .",
    "afterwords nine other double neutron star ( dns ) systems have been discovered .",
    "among these ten dnss , seven systems are confirmed to be dnss and the rest are most likely to be dnss @xcite .",
    "these dnss are useful tools to test the validity of the general theory of relativity @xcite and even in principle to constrain the dense matter equations of state @xcite . in section [ sec : dns ] we discuss how the study of dnss can lead to a better understanding of the structure of neutron stars ( @xmath13 the equation of state ) , the physics of the pulsar magnetosphere and the formation scenario for the special case of the double pulsar system .",
    "most of the binary pulsars have either main sequence ( ms ) or white dwarf ( wd ) companions .",
    "knowledge about the values of the orbital parameters as well as of the spin periods and the masses of these pulsars ( and their companions ) might be useful to understand the evolutionary history of these systems .",
    "the possible causes of eccentricities of millisecond pulsar binaries have been studied in this article .",
    "when these systems are in dense stellar environments as in globular clusters , the eccentricities can arise as a result of different types of interactions of single stars with pulsar binaries like  fly - by \" ,  exchange \" and  merger \" ( section [ sec : gc ] ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the only eccentric millisecond pulsar psr j@xmath14 in the galactic disk is difficult to explain as the hierarchical triple scenario faces difficulties to satisfy observed parameters of this system and the globular cluster origin also appears to be unlikely ( section [ sec : triple ] ) .",
    "all the findings of the present work have been summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "after performing pulsar observations , one determines ",
    "time of arrivals \" ( toas ) of pulses at the telescope . then various clock corrections are applied to the toas , followed by some other corrections @xmath15  rmer delay \" ,  shapiro delay \" and  einstein delay \" to calculate the toas with respect to the solar system barycenter .",
    "then the correction for the frequency dependent delay ( dispersion ) by the interstellar medium is added .",
    "finally , the pulse phase @xmath16 is fitted with time as a taylor series expansion like @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are reference phase and time , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the spin frequency and its first time derivative . in case of a binary pulsar , one needs to model the orbital motion of the pulsar , and before doing that same type of delays for the binary system ( @xmath15 another set of  rmer delay \" ,  shapiro delay \" and  einstein delay \" ) should be taken into account . for a non - relativistic binary pulsar",
    ", five keplerian parameters are required to describe the orbit , these are the orbital period ( @xmath22 ) , projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the sky plane ) , orbital eccentricity ( @xmath25 ) , longitude of periastron ( @xmath26 ) and the epoch of the periastron passage ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the semi major axes of the pulsar orbit and the companion orbit can be written as @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively where @xmath30 is the semi major axis of the relative orbit coming in the kepler s law @xmath31 . here @xmath32 is the mass of the pulsar and @xmath33 is the mass of the companion .",
    "pulsar timing analysis means first getting an initial fit for the orbital parameters by inspecting the variation of the pulse period ( which is equal to the spin period @xmath34 of the pulsar ) and then improving the values of the parameters through a phase connected timing solution .",
    "but for relativistic binaries ( @xmath0 when the companion of the pulsar is another neutron star or a white dwarf ) , five post - keplerian ( pk ) parameters are needed , which are the relativistic advance of periastron ( @xmath35 ) , redshift parameter ( @xmath36 ) , shapiro parameters ( range  @xmath37 \" and shape  @xmath38 \" ) and the rate of change of orbital period ( @xmath39 ) due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "details of all the above mentioned parameters and how they are used in the timing models are described very nicely in ",
    "handbook of pulsar astronomy \" by d. r. lorimer and m. kramer @xcite .",
    "post - keplerian descriptions of the orbits are essential for  double neutron star \" ( dns ) binaries which include psr j0737 - 3039(a , b ) , psr b1534 + 12 , psr j1756 - 2251 , psr j1811 - 173 , psr j1906 + 0746 , psr b1913 + 16 , psr b2127 + 11c ( confirmed dnss ) , psr j1518 + 4904 , psr b1820 - 11 , psr j1829 + 2456 ( candidate dnss - orbital parameters hint dns nature but companion mass informations are insufficient to confirm ) .",
    "only one of the dnss , namely psr j0737 - 3039 is a double pulsar system @xmath0 both the neutron stars emit radio pulses .",
    "this feature has made this system a unique astrophysical laboratory and we shall discuss about it in more details in subsections [ subsec : eos ] , [ subsec : intab ] and [ subsec : form_double ] . moreover , there are three relativistic ns - wd systems - psr j0751 + 1807 , psr j1757 - 5322 , psr j1141 - 6545 for which also post - keplerian descriptions are unavoidable .",
    "let us now try to understand how dnss can help us in better understanding of the structure of neutron stars , physics of the pulsar magnetosphere and formation scenario ( for the special case of the double pulsar system ) of neutron stars .",
    "after the first proposal of neutron star as the ultimate fate of stars ( of mass @xmath40 ) by baade and zwicky in 1934 @xcite and the immediate prediction of mass and radius by oppenheimer and volkoff in 1939 @xcite , many people worked to understand the nature of matter at such high densities , resulting a large number of equations of states ( esos ) including the esos for strange quark matter .",
    "different esos result different mass - radius relations - see fig 2 of @xcite to realize how different the mass - radius curves can be .",
    "so the question arises , how to test the validity of those esos .",
    "presently there are a number of efforts to constrain the esos through astronomical observations in x - rays .",
    "the usual approach is to determine the mass and the radius of the stars with the help of various observational features like gravitational redshifts ( z ) from spectral lines , cooling characteristics , khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) etc @xcite .",
    "but these methods are not foolproof , @xmath15 the value of z used in zel s @xcite analysis of exo 0748@xmath7676 could not be reproduced afterwords @xcite . moreover , to constrain esos from qpo observations , one needs to believe in a particular model of qpo which is again a subject of debate .",
    "an alternative method to constrain the dense matter esos might be the measurement of the moment of inertia of a neutron star in a relativistic binary , especially for a dns system and to match this observationally determined value with the theoretically predicted one .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) which gives the best agreement between observed and the theoretical values of the moment of inertia of the ns can be considered as the best description of ns structure .",
    "the moment of inertia of a neutron star of known mass can be theoretically calculated for any particular eos either using hartle s approximations @xcite or by performing exact calculations @xcite for the rotating axisymmetric neutron star .",
    "it has been checked that the values of moment of inertia for a particular ns obtained by this two approaches do not differ more than 1% for a star like psr j0737 - 3039a @xcite .",
    "we found the moment of inertia of psr j0737 - 3039a to be in the range @xmath41 for a set of esos having different stiffness @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss about observational determination of the moment of a neutron star by accurate measurement of the periastron advance ( @xmath35 ) of the orbit of a relativistic binary pulsar ( preferably a dns ) through timing analysis .",
    "the theoretical expression of @xmath35 including the effect of spin - orbit coupling is known to be as follow @xcite : @xmath42 \\label{eq : per_adv}\\ ] ] where the first term inside the square bracket is the 1pn term , the second term is the 2pn term , and the third term represents the spin - orbit coupling ( so ) .",
    "the parameters used in the above expression are defined as : @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : gs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the gravitational constant , @xmath48 is the moment of inertia of the @xmath49 body ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is its angular velocity of rotation ( here @xmath52 means modulo 2 , @xmath0 2 + 1=1 ) and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the spin period of the @xmath49 star and @xmath22 is the orbital period of the binary .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the orbital angular momentum vector , @xmath58 is the spin vector , @xmath59 is the line of sight vector perpendicular to the sky and @xmath24 is the inclination of the orbit with respect to the sky implying that the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath57 is also @xmath24 .    in the expression of @xmath35 , the moment of inertia of both members of the dns system",
    "are present ( through @xmath60 and @xmath61 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : per_adv ] ) which means that we have only one observable and two unknowns making eqn .",
    "( [ eq : per_adv ] ) unsolvable .",
    "but fortunately , @xmath62 is negligible for @xmath63 ms .",
    "so if @xmath64 ms , equation for periastron advance becomes @xmath65 \\label{eq : per_advnew}\\ ] ] so dns binaries having one fast neutron star ( @xmath66 ms ) and another slow neutron star ( @xmath67 ms ) are needed to extract the moment of inertia of the faster one by equating the observed @xmath35 with the prediction of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : per_advnew ] ) using measured values of @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that the angle between @xmath71 and @xmath57 plays a vital to in the expression of @xmath72 . if @xmath73 , the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath71 becomes @xmath24 and we get @xmath74 .",
    "but if this is not the case @xmath0 the angle between @xmath71 and @xmath75 has a non - zero value , @xmath72 will be maximum if @xmath76 is parallel to the vector @xmath77 $ ] giving @xmath78^{1/2}\\left[\\frac{x_1 \\left(4x_1 + 3x_{2 } \\right)}{3 \\left(1-e^2 \\right)^{1/2}}\\right]$ ] , for other orientation of @xmath71 , @xmath72 will be between @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "so the knowledge of the angle between @xmath57 and @xmath76 is needed for determination of the moment of inertia of the faster member of a dns system .    at present",
    ", it seems that the use of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : per_advnew ] ) to determine the moment of inertia of a neutron star is possible only for the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 @xcite , as for this system , timing analysis of the pulses from both the stars has already enabled us to determine @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the two pulsars which are named as psr j0737 - 3039a and psr j0737 - 3039b have masses and spin periods as @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ms and @xmath85 s with orbital parameters as @xmath86 , @xmath87 days , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "so it is clear that we can easily neglect the spin - orbit term due to pulsar b. although the angles between the vectors @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not known which are needed to be determined first to measure the moment of inertia of the pulsar a accurately . just for the sake of completeness , we wish to mention that for psr j0737 - 3039 , the value of @xmath92 is 1.2176 whereas the value of @xmath93 is 0.60876 .",
    "the accuracies of other relevant parameters are also needed to be improved .    in general",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath94 term in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : per_advnew ] ) will have higher value for ( i ) smaller value of @xmath95 , ( ii ) smaller value of @xmath22 and ( iii ) higher value of @xmath25 .",
    "unfortunately , the eccentricity of psr j0737 - 3039 is small in comparison to other dnss .",
    "future discovery of any double pulsar system satisfying these three conditions better than psr j0737 - 3039 will be useful for the purpose of moment of inertia measurement ( in addition to the necessary condition @xmath96 ms ) .      among many interesting features observed from the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 , one is the variation of the flux density of the slower pulsar b at its different orbital phases due to the distortion of b s magnetosphere by a s wind @xcite . on the other hand , the flux density of pulsar a is constant for most of its orbit except @xmath97 s near its superior conjuction when the radio beam from the pulsar a is eclipsed by the magnetosphere of the pulsar b @xcite .",
    "the eclipse is asymmetric , with the flux density decreasing more slowly during ingress than it increases during egress .",
    "the duration of the eclipse is very mildly dependent on the observing frequencies , with the eclipse lasting slightly longer at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "theoretical models explain these eclipse properties in the context of synchrotron absorption of a s radio emission by the plasma in the closed field line region of b s magnetosphere @xcite . by modeling the eclipse , the precession of b s",
    "spin axis about the orbital momentum vector has been found to match with the prediction of the general theory of relativity within the @xmath98 measurement uncertainty @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention here that till date , the eclipse has been studied in the observing frequency range 427 - 1400 mhz .",
    "the study of psr j0737 - 3039 ( both a and b ) at a much lower frequency of 326 mhz is being performed using ooty radio telescope ( rac - tifr , ooty , india ) .",
    "the details of eclipse characteristic at this low frequency will be useful to test the validity of the eclipse models and better understanding of the pulsar magnetosphere .      using observed parameters of the double pulsar system ,",
    "different formation models were proposed @xcite .",
    "initially , it was proposed that this system has originated from a close helium star plus a neutron star binary in which at the onset of the evolution the helium star had a mass in the range 4.0 @xmath7 6.5 @xmath99 and an orbital period in the range 0.1 @xmath7 0.2 day @xcite . in this model , a kick velocity in the range 70 @xmath7 230 @xmath100 must have been imparted to the second neutron star at its birth .",
    "afterwords an electron capture supernova scenario was proposed @xcite . at the same time",
    ", piran & shaviv @xcite estimated that it is most likely that the progenitor of the pulsar b had a mass of @xmath101 with a low kick velocity 30 @xmath100 . on the other hand , a study based on the population synthesis method @xcite favored the standard formation scenario with reasonably high kick velocities ( 70 - 180 @xmath100 ) . later",
    ", it has been suggested @xcite that the pulsar b is a strange star rather than a neutron star as the baryon loss is smaller for the first case supporting the models with small kick .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are dense spherical collection of stars orbiting around the galactic center containing a significant number of binary stars .",
    "the first radio pulsar discovered in a globular cluster is psr b1821 - 24a in m28 @xcite in 1987 , 20 years after the discovery of first pulsar by jocelyn bell .",
    "this pulsar is at present an isolated pulsar but its very low spin period ( 3 millisecond ) hints to a binary origin and spin - up due to accretion .",
    "how old and evolved stellar systems like gcs can contain apparently young , active objects like pulsars have led to suggestions , based on lifetime constraints from orbital decay by gravitational radiation @xcite , that some of these systems have been formed recently , or are forming even today .",
    "interaction between binary stars and single stars in gcs is believed to be an important dynamical process as the resulting binary systems may provide a substantial source of energy for the host gc , as the binding energies of a few , very close binaries ( like neutron star binaries ) can approach that of a moderately massive gc @xcite .",
    "observable parameters of the pulsars and their binary companions in gcs , such as spin , orbital period and eccentricity , projected radial position in the cluster , companion mass and their distributions provide a tracer of the past history of dynamical interactions of the binary nss in individual gcs .",
    "these parameters can even provide a valuable test - bed to examine the theoretical scenarios of formation and evolution of recycled pulsars .      till today , a total of 140 pulsars in 26 gcspfreire / gcpsr.html .",
    "] have been discovered . among them",
    "74 are known as binaries ( in 23 gcs ) , 59 are known as isolated and 7 have no published timing / orbital solutions .",

    "so we exclude it from our analysis and proceed with the rest 73 binaries .    in fig [ fig : porbecc_gc ] ,",

    "this matches with the earlier estimate using @xmath38 and @xmath297 supporting the assumption that the @xmath275 is purely relativistic @xcite .",
    "however , because of the lower precision in the measurement of @xmath37 , it is impossible to exclude small contributions to @xmath275 at present . using eqn .",
    "[ dgdt ] , we found that for preferable combination of @xmath298 the contribution form the first two terms in eqn .",
    "[ dgdt ] can be negligible in comparison to the third term .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdot_htgr ] we plot the variation of @xmath267 and @xmath268 with @xmath69 and @xmath299 for a fixed @xmath300 ( for such combinations of @xmath69 , @xmath299 and @xmath301 that both the inequalities ( [ alpha_gr ] ) and ( [ alpha_ma ] ) are satisfied ) ; red points are for @xmath267 and green points are for @xmath268 .",
    "@xmath268 is independent of @xmath69 and @xmath299 ( see the third term of eqn .",
    "[ dgdt ] ) and matches with the observed value @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath267 can be significantly less than @xmath268 for sufficiently small values of @xmath299 . in that case",
    "the companion mass measured using @xmath38 and @xmath37 can match with the measurement done with @xmath38 and @xmath297 assuming @xmath302 .",
    "but the precision of @xmath37 is still improving significantly with continued timing and it might be possible in future to confirm whether there is even any small deviation of @xmath297 from @xmath268 .    in principle , @xmath303 measurement can also help to test the validity of hierarchical triple scenario . for a hierarchical triple system",
    ", the observed @xmath303 can be the combined effect of three terms like @xmath304 , where @xmath305 is the rate of change of eccentricity because of kozai oscillation in a hierarchical triple system given by eqn .",
    "( [ dedtht ] ) , @xmath306 is the rate of change of eccentricity because of gravitational wave radiation given by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : dedtgr ] ) and @xmath307 is due to geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis ( see eqns . 8.58 , 8.82 and 8.91 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : dedtgr ] ) that @xmath306 is always negative and we found it to be @xmath308 for the inner binary as mentioned above . eqn .",
    "( [ dedtht ] ) shows that @xmath305 can be positive or negative depending on whether @xmath309 is positive or negative and for @xmath310 , @xmath311 making @xmath305 negative .",
    "so the magnitude of @xmath305 should be such that @xmath312 .",
    "the problem here is that although we can calculate @xmath305 using eqn .",
    "( [ dedtht ] ) @xcite using the parameters of the inner binary as mentioned earlier and varying @xmath313 , @xmath265 , @xmath299 and @xmath69 over realistic ranges satisfying conditions ( [ alpha_gr ] ) and ( [ alpha_ma ] ) , we can not calculate @xmath307 as the orientation of the spin axis of the pulsar with respect to the total orbital angular momentum is not known , which is needed to calculate @xmath307 ( see eqns .",
    "8.58 , 8.82 and 8.91 of @xcite ) . moreover , the presently determined value of @xmath303 from timing analysis is @xmath314 which is merely the measurement uncertainty ( unpublished , provided by paulo freire through private communication ) .",
    "so this approach can not help us to test the hierarchical triple hypothesis at present .",
    "on the other hand , the observed value of the spin period derivative @xmath315 can be used to test the hierarchical triple scenario . a rough estimate for @xmath315",
    "can be obtained by treating the inner binary as a single object of mass @xmath248 which forms a wide binary with stellar mass companion of mass @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "further , we let the projected semi - major axis of this new binary to be @xmath316 times that of the inner binary and choose a value for @xmath299 consistent with inequalities ( [ alpha_gr ] ) and ( [ alpha_ma ] )",
    ". the associated line of sight acceleration leads to an estimate of @xmath317 of the order of @xmath318 and this is much higher than the reported value @xmath319 @xcite .",
    "this is fact seems to be a clear indication that this system is not the part of a hierarchical triple .",
    "there is an alternative hierarchical triple scenario @xcite , such that the original inner companion ( wd ) of the pulsar has been evaporated by now and we see only the outer binary at present with @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 and @xmath325 days .",
    "this scenario is difficult to test as we do nt have any information about the parameters of the extinguished inner binary like @xmath68 , @xmath266 , @xmath326 and @xmath264 . in this case , the agreement between the measurement of the present day companion mass ( @xmath69 ) using @xmath38 and @xmath327 with the same using @xmath38 and @xmath37 is expected as @xmath327 is only due to general relativistic effect ( third term in eqn . [ dgdt ] ) because there is only one binary at present .",
    "let us now comment on the possible globular cluster origin for the system , motivated by the fact that in globular clusters , stellar interactions can impart eccentricity to millisecond pulsar binaries and indeed @xmath328 of the millisecond binaries in globular clusters have eccentricity @xmath329 . using the formalism discussed in the earlier section for fly - by interaction ( see [ eq : tfly2 ] ) , we find that the psr j1903 + 0327 like systems could have been produced in globular cluster systems up to a mean @xmath330 but not in any globular cluster with a higher value of this parameter . here",
    "we consider maximum allowed timescale for stellar interaction to be @xmath331 years as the characteristic age of the pulsar is @xmath332 years which is usually an upper limit of the true age of a radio pulsar @xcite .",
    "thus the putative origin of psr j1903 + 0327 inside a globular cluster could have taken place only in a restricted set of globular clusters .",
    "this further restricts the environment for production of such pulsars and therefore the overall probability for origin of this pulsar in a globular cluster must be smaller than that estimated by the dicoveres @xcite .",
    "here it is noteworthy to mention that the other types of eccentricity inducing interactions @xmath15 exchanges and mergers also scale with the parameter @xmath129 - so these interactions also can lead to psr j1903 + 0327 like systems only for a restricted set of globular clusters .",
    "so the eccentricity of this system still remains to be a puzzle to us .",
    "in this article we discuss how orbital parameters of binary radio pulsars reveal the history of their formation and evolution including dynamic interactions with other objects , the physics of the matter at extreme densities as inside the pulsar as well as the properties of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "firstly we try to understand the importance of studying dnss .",
    "if at least one of the ns of a dns is a radio pulsar , we can determine the moment of inertia of the pulsar through accurate radio timing analysis by measuring the extra advancement of the periastron of the orbit due to the spin - orbit coupling over the standard post - newtonian one .",
    "then by matching this observed value of the moment of inertia with the theoretically predicted value , one can constrain the dense matter eos .",
    "one necessary condition for this to be done is that the pulsar must be rapidly spinning and its companion ns must be much slower ; the double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039(a / b ) seems to be the most potential candidate for this purpose till date as we know that psr j0737 - 3039a has @xmath333 ms whereas psr j0737 - 3039b has @xmath334 s. moreover the masses of both the nss are well determined .",
    "we also checked how good the system really is for this purpose by studying the effect of various parameters on the spin - orbit coupling term as a larger value of this term will facilitate the moment of inertia measurement .",
    "we found that this term has larger effect if the following conditions are satisfied - ( i ) short spin period ( ii ) short orbital period , ( iii ) high eccentricity .",
    "unfortunately , psr j0737 - 3039 lacks conditions ( iii ) and even ( i ) to some extent .",
    "so it will be nice if we can find better systems satisfying all the above conditions .",
    "globular clusters are potential sources for favorable dns systems in the above sense as dnss can be formed by exchange collisions due to the high stellar density and the abundance of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters .",
    "on the contrary , only one dns has been found in a gc so far which might be a result of selection effects as gcs are usually at larger distances in comparison to the disk pulsars .",
    "the resulting binaries are more probable to be highly eccentric with a millisecond pulsar facilitating moment of inertia estimation . we have also discussed how the study of the eclipse of the radio beam of psr j0737 - 3039a by the magnetosphere of psr j0737 - 3039b can be used as a tool to understand the magnetospheric properties of a pulsar in a better extent .",
    "some suggestive works about the formation of psr j0737 - 3039a / b have been mentioned too .",
    "we explain the presently observed orbital eccentricity and period data of gc binary pulsars by stellar interaction scenarios of fly - bys , exchanges and mergers with field stars .",
    "binaries with @xmath335 are most probably the result of exchange or merger events whereas binaries with @xmath336 are products of fly - by of single stars .",
    "a number of wide orbit intermediate eccentricity pulsars seen in the galactic disk are absent in the gc sample because they have been kicked up to relatively high eccentricities by passing stars in the dense stellar environments in gcs . in some gcs such as ter 5",
    ", the stellar densities are so high , and the velocity dispersion so modest that the interaction timescale for exchange and fly - by interactions is relatively short . in such gcs a typical binary system may undergo multiple interactions . if the original binary contains a spun - up millisecond pulsar in a relatively  soft \" binary , then the exchange interaction may even produce a single millisecond pulsar in the cluster .",
    "this may explain the higher incidence of isolated millisecond pulsars in gcs compared to that in the galactic disk @xcite ; in gcs 52 out of 59 isolated pulsars are millisecond pulsars whereas in the disk 23 out of 1565 isolated pulsars are millisecond pulsars .",
    "in addition , exchange interactions , as we have seen , can lead to highly eccentric orbits and the system can be ejected from the cluster core . if the last encounter took place not too long ago , the system can be at a relatively large offset from the cluster core , albeit being still spatially co - located with the gc .",
    "we have found that the eccentricity of psr b1638 + 36b ( in m13 ) is difficult to explain by any type of interactions - fly - by , exchange or merger .",
    "so we propose that either its true eccentricity is lower than the presently known upper limit or it is a member of a hierarchical triple .",
    "we have also considered the effects of collision induced ionization on the present day distribution of orbital parameters of radio pulsars in gcs . in the galactic disk",
    "we find 12 pulsars with @xmath337 days ( although few of them have more massive companions than the pulsar binaries in the gcs ) , while there are only 3 pulsars in this range of orbital period . although it is tempting to speculate that these systems are missing from the present day gcs because they have been ionized in the past , we find that the ionization probability becomes substantial in this orbital period range only for very small values of companion masses .",
    "observational selection effects can be the cause of this discrepancy between the number of large orbital period pulsars in the disk in comparison to that in gcs .",
    "many galactic disk binary pulsars are seen in the region of @xmath194 plane predicted by phinney due to the fluctuation dissipation of convective eddies and the resultant orbital eccentricities that are induced .",
    "these pulsars are missing from the gc sample .",
    "there is no reason not to expect these systems to form in the gcs ( although due to the lower metallicity of the stellar companions in gcs , they are expected to be in slightly different region in the @xmath194 plane ) .",
    "this can be explained by the substantial probability of them being knocked out of their original phase space due to stellar interaction in gcs .",
    "indeed there are some wide binaries in the present day gcs with moderately high eccentricities ( e.g. @xmath338 and @xmath339 ) which could have arisen out of fly - bys or exchanges from progenitor binaries with  relic \" eccentricities @xmath340 ( merger in unlikely because of moderately low values of @xmath33s ) .",
    "the circularity of group iii pulsars in gcs are thought to be due to either their special formation channels and young age or due to their locations at the outskirts of the gcs .",
    "psr j1903@xmath1050327 is the only one eccentric millisecond pulsar in the galactic disk discovered so far .",
    "its millisecond spin - period suggests the spin - up scenario through accretion in the past .",
    "as such recycled pulsars are expected to be in circular orbits due to tidal - coupling induced circularization , this system has created lots of interest among pulsar researchers . as it is well known that in globular clusters , stellar interactions can impart eccentricity to an initially circular orbit , the possibility of past gc association of this system have been studied and almost rejected . moreover",
    ", the possibility of this system being a member of a hierarchical triple system also seems to be less unlikely .",
    "so this system remains an open question for us .",
    "we hope in the future with more advanced technologies like ska , many more new interesting types of pulsars will be discovered and that the exciting and challenging situation will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the physics of pulsars .",
    "this article uses some of the results of the collaborative works with alak ray and achamveedu gopakumar whom the author wishes to thank .",
    "the author also thanks michael kramer and paulo freire for discussions ; bhaswati bhattacharyya and ranjeev misra for comments on the manuscript ."
