    "according to the `` holographic principle ''  @xcite , quantum gravity in spacetimes with some prescribed asymptotic behaviour can be described by a theory defined on the boundary at infinity .",
    "such a principle implies an enormous reduction in degrees of freedom relative to conventional local quantum field theory in the bulk spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , everyday experience shows that local objects exist in the semiclassical limit .",
    "so , in order to accept the holographic principle , it is necessary to understand how such objects are encoded and detected in the holographic dual .    a simple example of holography is the proposed duality between gravity in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces and local conformal field theories ( cfts ) defined on the ads boundary  @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical limit in ads is related to a large central charge limit of the cft . in this context",
    ", classical supergravity probes are described by dual cft states in which operators have expectation values derived directly from the asymptotic behaviour of fields coupling to the probe  @xcite .",
    "this was used to show a `` scale - radius duality '' for a variety of bulk sources , and for wavepackets of supergravity fields  the radial position of a bulk probe is encoded in the scale size of the dual expectation values .",
    "dynamical sources for supergravity fields were studied in  @xcite , where the radial position of a source particle following a bulk geodesic was reflected in the size and shape of an expectation - value bubble in the cft .",
    "other interesting work along these lines was performed in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the scale - radius duality provides a simple example of the holographic encoding of information about the location and motion of objects in the additional spacetime dimension .",
    "however , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ 1pt ] , the simple scale - radius relationship is a consequence of an isometry in pure ads under rescalings of all coordinates . for spacetimes such as black holes which break the isometries , the relationship between bulk position and boundary observables will be more complicated .",
    "we will illustrate this point by discussing a dilaton source falling into a btz black hole , following danielsson et.al .",
    "the same phenomenon is apparent in the collision of two particles to form a black hole in  @xcite ; after the particles collide , their radial position is fixed , but the scales in the boundary expectation values continue to evolve .",
    "if a simple scale - radius duality fails , do cft expectation values still tell us the location of bulk sources ? in sec .",
    "[ 1pt ] , we will review the surprising power of the expectation values , and discuss what one can learn about the bulk in general .",
    "if we write ads in the global coordinate system , all the normalizable mode spherical harmonics fall off at the same rate at the spacetime boundary . as a result",
    ", expectation values of the dual operators contain all the multipole moments of any bulk solution which is constructed by superposition of these modes .",
    "therefore , such supergravity configurations will be completely determined by the cft one - point functions .    however , there are distinct supergravity configurations which are identical outside of some region .",
    "examples include spacetimes with spherically symmetric matter distributions , and collections of point particles in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "it is important to describe these examples from the cft perspective , because they include simple processes of particular interest , such as spherically symmetric collapse to form a black hole . in such cases",
    ", cft expectation values will not resolve distinct bulk configurations .",
    "we will argue that there are non - local quantities in the gauge theory that can provide the necessary data .",
    "the core of this paper is the use of the feynman green function to extract information about bulk solutions from the cft .",
    "we consider asymptotically @xmath0 spacetimes containing point particles , as this is a particularly tractable example . in sec .",
    "[ single ] , we derive the effect of a stationary particle on the green function of an operator dual to a scalar field . we compute the green function by a wkb approximation , relating it to the length of geodesics , and find that the particle s presence is signalled by a kink in the propagator . in sec .",
    "[ moving ] , we show how the motion of particles in @xmath0 is reflected in these kinks .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "the head - on collision of particles produces a btz black hole  @xcite if the combined energy exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ two ] that in the holographic description of this process there are initially two kinks in the cft green function , indicating the separate positions of the two particles .",
    "the discontinuities approach each other and merge into a single one associated with the final black hole .",
    "remarkably , the kinks are sensitive to the positions of the particles _ inside _ the event horizon , until their eventual collision to form a singularity .",
    "this supports the assertion that the holographic dual gives a unitary description of processes localized inside a black hole horizon , which should have important implications for information loss .",
    "flat space may be obtained from ads by taking the length scale ( @xmath6 ) of the spacetime to infinity . the measurement precision required for detecting the separation of two particles increases with @xmath6 . in the flat space limit",
    ", we find that infinite precision measurements are required in the holographic dual to three dimensional gravity to detect the difference between one and two bulk particles .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ conc ] by drawing some general lessons from our work and suggesting directions for the future .",
    "in the lorentzian version of the ads / cft correspondence , we must specify both boundary conditions at infinity and initial conditions for the normalizable modes in spacetime .",
    "changing the boundary conditions at infinity corresponds to turning on sources in the dual cft , while the choice of normalizable modes corresponds to the state  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that both of these choices will affect the one - point functions of the operators dual to supergravity fields , and the effect of a number of bulk sources on the expectation values was explicitly calculated . here",
    ", we wish to make some general comments , drawing on previously studied examples for support .",
    "the expectation value of the cft operator is essentially given by the asymptotic value of the normalizable modes  @xcite . in poincar coordinates , @xmath7 the first term is the effect of a normalizable mode @xmath8 , behaving as @xmath9 as @xmath10 , and the second term is the effect of a change in the boundary conditions by @xmath11 .",
    "the normalizable modes of scalar fields of mass @xmath12 in global ads@xmath13 with scale @xmath6 behave as  @xcite @xmath14 where the boundary is at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 denotes spherical harmonics on @xmath18 .",
    "the falloff of the modes as @xmath19 is _ independent _ of the angular quantum numbers .",
    "thus , the dual expectation values @xmath20 will determine all the spherical harmonics , and therefore all the multipole moments , of the bulk solution .",
    ", the bulk spacetime has two boundaries ; however , specifying the boundary conditions and expectation values on one boundary is sufficient to determine the bulk solutions , and hence the values on the other boundary .",
    "therefore the @xmath21 theory has only one set of independent observables , corresponding to the expected dual quantum mechanics . ]",
    "this ensures that the expectation values will contain all information about any solution constructed by superposition of the basic modes ( [ globalnorm ] ) . at infinity ,",
    "the fields fall off exponentially in proper distance , but the exponential is the same for all modes .",
    "although the bulk fields are themselves minuscule at the boundary , cft expectation values are given by the finite prefactor to the decaying exponential .",
    "as seen in the examples discussed in  @xcite , and in several subsequent papers , the radial position of supergravity sources in pure ads is encoded in the dual one - point function in a particularly simple way ; radial translation of the source corresponds to a rescaling of the corresponding expectation value .",
    "this is called scale - radius duality , and is an example of a general relationship between radial positions and boundary scales  @xcite .    for sources at fixed poincar coordinate radial positions , this relation follows because the ads metric is unchanged by the rescaling @xmath22 given the solution describing a source at some radial position , we can describe a source at a different radial position by the redefinition ( [ resc ] ) .",
    "the effect on the asymptotic fields , and hence the one - point function , is simply a rescaling of the coordinates  @xcite .    in global ads",
    ", symmetry dictates that a source at the origin is represented by a cft expectation value which is constant over the boundary sphere .",
    "there is an isometry mapping this source to one following any other geodesic in the spacetime .",
    "this isometry acts as a conformal transformation in the dual cft , a fact exploited in  @xcite to obtain cft expectation values dual to moving sources in the bulk .    in cases with less symmetry , the story is more complicated .",
    "a good example is a point source for the dilaton falling into a btz black hole , which was studied by danielsson et.al .",
    "@xcite using the method of images and the result for sources in @xmath0 . in the lightlike limit",
    ", such a particle entering the boundary at @xmath23 , produces the asymptotic dilaton field @xmath24 } + { \\delta(\\phi_- -   2\\pi n ) \\over \\sinh^{\\nu+1}[{(r_+-r_- ) \\over 2}(\\phi_+ + 2\\pi n ) ] } ,   \\label{eskobtz}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the horizons .",
    "therefore , the corresponding expectation value is concentrated on the light cones @xmath27 , as for a single particle in ads@xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the sum over @xmath29 implements the periodic identification of @xmath30 in the btz black hole .",
    "simple scale - radius duality fails here , in the sense that the two light cones cross repeatedly ; so the scale size goes to zero , e.g. at @xmath31 , while the particle never returns to the boundary .",
    "in fact , the information concerning the location of the particle in the bulk seems to be contained in the amplitude of @xmath32 , which steadily declines in time .",
    "a related example is a pair of particles colliding to form a black hole  the boundary expectation value associated with each particle will continue to evolve independently after the collision , reaching zero scale size at a later time  @xcite . in this case also , the isometries used above are not available , being broken by the metric in the region to the future of both particles .",
    "consequently , the simple connection between scale size and radial position fails to apply directly .",
    "there are also examples where the cft expectation values implied by ( [ onept ] ) do not fully characterize a semiclassical bulk state . for example , a spherical shell of matter placed at any position within ads will have the same asymptotic fields and dual 1-point functions .",
    "( requiring the matter distribution to have compact support implies that these objects are not built from the supergravity modes ( [ globalnorm ] ) , all of which have tails at infinity . ) similarly , the only supergravity data available at infinity about a collection of point particles in @xmath0 is the total mass .",
    "so , the dual cft stress tensor has an expectation value  @xcite , but this is insufficient to count the particles or locate them in spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , the cft should somehow encode the difference between these bulk configurations .",
    "we wish to identify some cft quantities that probe the interior of the spacetime and characterize the bulk solutions conveniently .",
    "these quantities should be non - local from the cft perspective , because the scale - radius duality teaches us that locations further inside the spacetime correspond to larger scales in the gauge theory .",
    "wilson loop expectation values are such quantities  they depend on the action of strings that start on the boundary and penetrate the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "we can also use scattering amplitudes for the operators dual to supergravity fields .",
    "as we will see , in the wkb approximation the cft propagator is dominated by bulk geodesics . since these penetrate the spacetime",
    ", they can be used to distinguish bulk configurations with identical asymptotic fields . recently",
    "this approach has been applied to spherical shells of matter in @xmath33  @xcite , which will be analyzed further in a forthcoming paper involving one of us  @xcite . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will work out the details of this procedure for resolving point particles in three dimensions .",
    "global @xmath0 is described by the metric @xmath34 we have set the ads length scale @xmath6 to one , @xmath30 has a period @xmath35 , time runs between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the radial coordinate .",
    "fixed @xmath38 surfaces have the poincar disc geometry , and the dual cft is defined on the cylinder at the @xmath39 boundary .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 may be computed as in  @xcite to be @xmath40 and is equal to the ground state energy of the dual conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "we will introduce point particles into this spacetime and will show that kinks in the propagator for cft operators in the dual state locate the particle in the spacetime .",
    "it is helpful to begin by recasting the computation of cft correlators from @xmath0 in a language that is convenient for generalization to point particle states .",
    "a generic scalar field of mass @xmath41 in asymptotically @xmath0 spaces is dual to an operator @xmath42 of conformal dimension @xmath43 .",
    "we are going to show how the properties of point particles in @xmath0 can be read off from the green functions of such operators .",
    "it is helpful to begin by computing the propagator in the conformally invariant vacuum .",
    "we can normalize the operator @xmath42 so that on the euclidean plane ( @xmath44 ) its 2-point function is constrained by conformal invariance to be @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the distances from the origin and @xmath30 is the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "transform to the euclidean cylinder ( @xmath50 ) by setting @xmath51 and weyl rescaling the metric by @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 parametrize any closed curve on this cylinder with the condition @xmath54 imposed for later convenience",
    ". then @xmath55 wick rotating to lorentzian signature ( @xmath56 ) leaves ( [ eqt1 ] ) unchanged , but in lorentzian signature it should be understood as the logarithm of the feynman green function for @xmath42 .",
    "we want to reproduce this from the ads / cft correspondence in a manner convenient for generalization to point particles in @xmath0 .",
    "the cft dual to @xmath0 is defined on a cylinder with diverging weyl factor .",
    "so the green function for dual operators at any finite coordinate separation will vanish .",
    "it is convenient to regulate this behaviour by cutting off the spacetime at a boundary defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some smooth function of the boundary coordinates .",

    "defining the cutoff boundary curve @xmath64 the propagator for a scalar field of mass @xmath41 between points @xmath65 should be given by @xmath66 ( we will always be interested in large masses so that @xmath67 . ) here we are summing over all particle paths between the two boundary points and @xmath68 is the proper length of the path .",
    "( defined this way , @xmath69 is imaginary for spacelike trajectories . ) as a check , note that the action accumulated along a stationary trajectory should be @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the lowest energy the particle can have .",

    "if we consider the pure btz spacetime , none of the spacelike geodesics between points on one of the boundaries passes inside the black hole horizon . this should not be a surprise ; in the latter case , there is a second asymptotic region , and the boundary conditions we obtain from the gauge theory on one boundary are not sufficient to determine the spacetime inside the black hole .",
