    ", the compounds of helium atoms display a series of unique microscopic and macroscopic physical phenomena .    the closed shell electronic structure , as well as",
    "the compactness of the helium atom , makes it the most chemically inert noble gas . nevertheless , the very weak van der waals attraction between two distant he atoms is responsible for the fact that at very low temperatures , both bosonic @xmath2he and fermionic @xmath3he liquify .",
    "in addition , the extreme weakness of the he - he interaction is decisive in explaining why liquid helium is the only known superfluid .    as much exciting",
    "is the physics of the atomic helium nanoscopic structures ( he multimers ) .",
    "recent inspiring experiments  @xcite have demonstrated the existence of bound diatomic @xmath2he systems ( dimers ) - the ground state with the weakest binding energy of all naturally existing diatomic molecules . moreover , diffraction experiment projecting a molecular beam of small he clusters on nanostructured transmission gratings , allowed a direct measurement of the dimer average bond length value @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "such a large bond , compared to the effective range of the he - he potential , enables one to estimate its binding energy @xmath6 mk , as well as the @xmath2he-@xmath7he scattering length @xmath8 @xmath5 .",
    "the extreme weakness of the @xmath2he dimer binding energy requires a precise theoretical description of the _ ab initio _ he - he potential , which results from subtracting the huge energies of separated atoms .",
    "nevertheless , several very accurate theoretical models  @xcite were recently constructed , predicting helium properties in full agreement with experiments .",
    "these effective he - he potentials are dominated by the strong repulsion ( hard - core ) at distances @xmath9 @xmath5 , where the two he atoms are `` overlapping '' . at larger he -",
    "he distances , the weak van - der - waals attraction takes over , creating a shallow attractive pocket with a maximal depth of @xmath10 k , centered at @xmath11 .",
    "the strong repulsion of the he - he potential at short distance , allows to treat accurately atomic he systems without having to take into account the internal structure of single he atoms .",
    "the physics of small he clusters is an outstanding laboratory for testing different quantum mechanical phenomena .",
    "the bound state of @xmath2he dimer , at practically zero energy , suggests the possibility of observing an efimov - like state in the triatomic compound  @xcite .",
    "the existence of this @xmath2he dimer bound state very close to threshold , is also responsible for a resonant @xmath2he-@xmath2he s - wave scattering length @xmath12104 @xmath5 , which is more than 30 times larger than the typical length scale given by the van der waals interaction @xmath13 .",
    "the small he clusters low energy scattering observables should therefore be little sensitive to the details of he - he interaction and should thus exhibit some universal behavior .",
    "this sharp separation of different scales can be exploited , making he multimers a perfect testground for effective field theory ( eft ) approaches  @xcite .",
    "we present in this work a rigorous theoretical study of the smallest @xmath2he clusters .",
    "there exist in the literature a large number of theoretical calculations on triatomic @xmath2he ( trimer )  @xcite .",
    "however the four - atomic @xmath2he system ( tetramer ) , being by an order of magnitude more complex in its numerical treatment , remains practically unexplored .",
    "our study tries to fill up this gap , by providing original calculations for tetramer bound and scattering states .",
    "in addition , some existing ambiguities in triatomic @xmath2he calculations  @xcite are discussed .    to describe @xmath2he tetramer , faddeev - yakubovski ( fy ) equations in configuration space are solved . in some cases , this method may be cumbersome and numerically expensive .",
    "it constitutes nevertheless a very general and mathematically rigorous tool , with the big advantage over many other techniques , that it enables a systematic treatment of bound and continuum states .",

    "section  [ sec : tetramer ] deals with four - atomic helium systems and in section  [ sec : rotational ] , we discuss the possible existence of the rotational states in three - atomic and four - atomic@xmath2he systems .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this work with the final remarks .    to describe the interaction between the helium atoms , we have used the potential developed by aziz and slaman  @xcite , popularly referred to as lm2m2 potential .",
    "there exists several equivalent interaction models .",
    "however , they all have similar structure and quantitatively provide very close results  @xcite .",
    "all results presented in this paper are restricted to the bosonic @xmath2he isotope ; therefore in the following , we omit the mass number 4 and refer to @xmath7he as he . all calculations use @xmath14 k@xmath15@xmath16 as the input mass of he atoms .",
    "the schrdinger equation is the paradigm of non - relativistic quantum mechanics . however this equation is not able to separate different rearrangement channels in the asymptote of multiparticle wave function ( w.f . ) .",
    "thus it does not provide explicitly a way to implement the physical boundary conditions for scattering w.f .",
    ", which are necessary to obtain a unique solution .",
    "faddeev  @xcite have succeeded to show that these equations can be reformulated by introducing some additional physical constraints , what leads to mathematically rigorous and unique solution of the three - body scattering problem .",

    "the systematic generalization of faddeev equations for any number of particles was presented .",

    "however then one must deal directly with total systems w.f .",
    ", which is fully ( anti)symmetric and has quite complicated structure . exploiting the knowledge of systems symmetry one often tries to decompose this w.f . into only partially ( anti)symmetrized components , which had simpler structure and are more tractable numerically .",
    "one practical way is to decompose systems w.f . into so called fy components .",
    "then fy equations often have obvious advantage over schrdinger one , since it deals directly only with fy components by avoiding construction of full system wave function .    in",
    "that follows , we describe only four - particle fy equations ; three - particle faddeev equations are self - contained in four - particle ones .",
    "the calculations presented in this work were performed using the framework of differential fy equations developed by s.p.merkuriev and s.l .",
    "yakovlev  @xcite .",

    "equations  ( [ fadd_yak ] ) are not complete : they should be supplemented with the appropriate boundary conditions for fy components .",
    "it is usual to write boundary conditions in the dirichlet form , which at the origin should mean vanishing fy components .",

    "the relevant matrix elements from the physical interaction region ( shallow attractive well ) fade away in front of the huge repulsive hard - core terms , thus resulting in severe numerical instabilities .",
    "however , such a strong repulsion at the origin simply indicates that two he atoms can not get arbitrarily close to each other : for a repulsive region of characteristic size @xmath56 , the probability that two particles get closer to each other at a certain distance @xmath57 will be vanishingly small .",

    "this state is realized with the smallest partial angular momentum , i.e. @xmath147 , and consequently contains the smaller centrifugal terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the non - existence of this state would imply the non - existence of other states of the same decay group ",
    "i.e. @xmath148 )  since they involve larger centrifugal energies : @xmath149 .",
    "the existence of stable trimers in the second group is very doubtful ; the most favorable would be the @xmath150 one , for which one has already @xmath151 .    in a similar way",
    ", we can classify the rotational states of he tetramer ( see fig .  [ fig_4b_config ] ) . in the first group",
    ", we have states @xmath152 for which the first decay threshold is the trimer ground state .",
    "the most promising state inside this group is the @xmath146 one . for this state ,",
    "the condition @xmath153 must be satisfied .    in the second group , we have trimer decay stable states @xmath154 these states can neither break into trimer - atom pair nor into two dimers : their reference threshold is dimer plus two free atoms .",
    "@xmath143 state represents a special case : it can be broken only into four free atoms .",
    "the fy formalism we are using allows to calculate multiparticle rotational states with the same ease as zero angular momentum ones .",
    "however , none of trimer or tetramer rotational states have been found stable .",
    "the non - existence of weakly bound states can be easily verified using low energy scattering techniques for trimer and tetramer states in the first decay groups ( two cluster ) .",
    "in addition , the calculated scattering length turns out to be an indicator for the strength of the interaction between the scattered clusters and thus tests if nearthreshold bound or resonant states are present .    for atom - dimer scattering in 1@xmath155 ,",
    "one obtains a large positive scattering length @xmath156=114.2 @xmath5 .",
    "if he - he interaction is changed , this length scales with the dimer size .",
    "if we add a small attractive three - body interaction to force a trimer binding without affecting dimer , this scattering length becomes smaller .",
    "in fact , when the attractive three - body force is weak , this scattering length reduces very slowly . only when this additional force becomes rather strong , close to the critical value binding 1@xmath155 trimer ,",
    "the scattering length falls down to -@xmath157 .",
    "it crosses a singularity , passing from -@xmath157 to + @xmath157 at the value where 1@xmath155 trimer bound state appears , and then again stabilizes to large positive value .",
    "this clearly indicates that no trimer rotational state exist with quantum numbers @xmath158 .",
    "an even much stronger attractive three - body force is required to bind the second group @xmath145 states , thus excluding the possible existence of bound or even nearthreshold resonant he trimer states .",
    "the case of rotational tetramers is identical to the trimers one .",
    "a positive scattering length @xmath15912.28 @xmath5 is also obtained for he - he@xmath1 scattering with @xmath160 .",
    "this value is sensibly smaller than the one for @xmath146 atom - dimer scattering , which simply results from the scaling with the target size . as in trimers case",
    ", one has to apply a strong additional attractive force to reduce this scattering length to -@xmath157 , i.e. to force the @xmath146 tetramers binding .",
    "tetramers in the second decay group , as well as @xmath143 , seem to be even less favorable : they require an even stronger additional force to be bound . we conclude therefore that no bound or even nearthreshold resonant states should exist for tetramers with @xmath161 .",
    "in this paper , we have outlined faddeev - yakubovski equation formalism in configuration space .",
    "it enables a consistent description of bound and scattering states in multiparticle systems .",
    "this formalism was applied to study the lightest ( @xmath162 ) systems of he atoms using realistic he - he interaction .",
    "we have presented accurate calculations for bound he trimer and tetramer states , as well as for low energy atom - dimer and atom - trimer scattering .",
    "the first realistic calculation of he - he@xmath1 scattering length has been achieved , with the prediction @xmath164=104 @xmath5 .",
    "such a large value indicates the existence of a tetramer excited state close to the trimer ground state threshold .",
    "its binding energy can hardly be determined in a direct bound state calculation , due to the difficulties in accommodating a very extended wave function .",
    "we have shown that this energy can be obtained by applying an effective range expansion to low energy 1 + 3 scattering states .",
    "we predict the existence of a @xmath165 he tetramer excited state with a binding energy of 127.5 mk , situated 1.09 mk below the trimer ground state .",
    "finally , we have studied the possible existence of rotational states in three and four atomic he compounds .",
    "it has been shown that neither the he trimer nor the tetramer have bound rotational ( @xmath161 ) states .",
    "the existence of corresponding nearthreshold resonances is also doubtful .",
    "numerical calculations were performed at institut du dveloppement et des ressources en informatique scientifique ( idris ) from cnrs and at centre de calcul recherche et technologie ( ccrt ) from cea bruyres le chtel .",
    "we are grateful to the staff members of these two organizations for their kind hospitality and useful advices .",
