    "the transition from @xmath174 to @xmath176 can be understood in these terms : both fibrations over the annulus produced by restricting to @xmath442 are filled in the origin with a circle and @xmath96 respectively . in the transverse loop case",
    "it will be enough to use the following    [ lem : unique ] let @xmath284 be a manifold with contact structures @xmath443 and @xmath444 .",
    "assume that there are two smoothly isotopic diffeomorphisms @xmath445 which are contactomorphisms for @xmath443 and @xmath444 respectively .",
    "let the two fibrations be radial contact fibrations with common contact fiber @xmath446 and satisfying that the diffeomorphism @xmath447 is the identity close to the boundary .",
    "then , the contact structures @xmath443 are @xmath444 are isotopic .",
    "+ further , if the fiber is @xmath448 and the contact fibrations are @xmath439equivariant , the contact structures are isotopic through @xmath439equivariant contactomorphisms .    this can be reduced to the setup with a fibration @xmath449 with two different radial contact structures @xmath450 such that the hamiltonians @xmath451 and @xmath452 coincide close to the boundary . in that setting",
    ", we just need to construct a path of functions @xmath453 connecting them , relative to the boundary , satisfying the contact equation ( [ eq : contact ] ) and the condition @xmath454 .",
    "but this is possible since the space of such functions is convex .",
    "+ the argument still works in the equivariant case : the only sentence to be added is that the space of equivariant hamiltonians is also convex .    thus , to conclude uniqueness we study the contact topology of the different blow  up constructions and ensure that the lemma applies .",
    "+ _ proof of theorem [ thm : unique ] _ : let us describe the common model fibration that underlies the three constructions in this case . consider a standard contact neighbourhood @xmath455 of the given fixed loop and the morphism @xmath456 it does generalize the diffeomorphism provided by equation ( [ eq : change ] ) that reflects the case @xmath404 . if @xmath137 is greater than @xmath29 , it becomes a @xmath457 covering .",
    "the covering transformation is provided by @xmath439 acting through : @xmath458 which is free as long as @xmath127 . to understand the change in the contact structure , note that the pull  back of the standard contact form @xmath459 is given by @xmath460.\\ ] ] denote by @xmath461 the critical radius where the distribution becomes horizontal . in these coordinates , for any fixed small @xmath268 , the projection onto the first two factors @xmath462 provides a radial contact fibration on the annulus and since the function @xmath463 is strictly positive in @xmath464 , it can be extended to the interior of the disk to a @xmath439equivariant radial contact fibration . in order to glue back the model to the manifold",
    "we should quotient the equivariant contact fibration by @xmath439 , this allows us to use the map @xmath465 to insert the model back into the manifold .",
    "+ it is thus left to verify that the three blow  up procedures provide examples of such an extension for particular values of @xmath373",
    ". then lemma [ lem : unique ] will apply to provide the uniqueness of the constructions .",
    "note that the contact surgery blow  up",
    "construction is by definition a radial contact fibration , with @xmath404 , as shown in section [ sec : srgy ] .",
    "let us study the two remaining cases .",
    "+ to understand the proof in section [ sec : gromov ] , let us proceed backwards and instead of applying the boothby ",
    "wang construction , we produce a contact structure and then quotient the resulting contact manifold by the reeb @xmath120action to study whether it is the correct object .",
    "once the coordinate change @xmath465 is performed , the reeb vector field @xmath466 becomes @xmath467 this vector field extends to the interior of the disk fibration and so we may quotient the resulting manifold @xmath241 .",
    "we obtain the blown  up symplectic ball @xmath468 as its quotient .",
    "we can further quotient by the free @xmath439action to obtain a non  trivial fibration over the disk @xmath432 .",
    "this proves that a suitable choice of connection leads to an equivariant contact fibration .",
    "+ there are other choices of connection though . from the principal bundle point of view , a radial contact fibration over the annulus @xmath469 corresponds to a connection on @xmath470 certainly , after proposition [ propo : bundle_blow ] the contact structure is fixed with the choice of a connection .",
    "note that the space of connections is affine and thus , after gray s stability theorem , the resulting contact structures are contact isotopic for different choices of connections . in conclusion",
    ", this second model also provides an extension of the model fibration .",
    "+ we describe the third procedure also beginning with the resulting contact manifold and giving the pull  back of the action .",
    "this contact cut construction is also an equivariant radial contact fibration since the pull  back of the vector field generating the @xmath120action , that is @xmath471 is expressed as @xmath472 after the coordinate change .",
    "there , the contact cut is just an equivariant radial contact fibration , see the proof of theorem 2.11 in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath340 +    using lemma [ lem : unique ] , we can show that the contact blow ",
    "up is unique up to the choice of a trivializing chart of the neighbourhood of the transverse loop . in order to prove the uniqueness of the blow  up along transverse loops , we would need to study the space of isocontact embeddings of the contact manifold @xmath174 in @xmath0 .",
    "it is probably false that it is connected , which is the requirement needed to ensure the uniqueness of the blow  up once the parameters @xmath473 are fixed .",
