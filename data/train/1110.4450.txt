    "experiments so far have not detected any violation of baryon number ( @xmath2 ) , an accidental global symmetry of the standard model lagrangian .",
    "its conservation is dramatically demonstrated by the stringent limits on the proton lifetime , roughly @xmath3 years .",
    "the proton is not the lightest colour singlet , but it is the lightest colour singlet with baryon number , the conservation of which at low energy leads to its stability .",
    "similarly stringent limits are set from searches of baryon number violating neutron decay modes , neutron - antineutron oscillations , and dinucleon decays .",
    "baryon number violating processes must therefore be suppressed at low energy .",
    "the picture , however , may change at higher energy scales .",
    "there is no reason for @xmath2 to be conserved ; on the contrary , there are many strong theoretical reasons why this global symmetry should be broken .",
    "the sm already contains violation of baryon number at high temperatures , through the non - perturbative sphaleron process , which breaks @xmath2 and lepton number ( @xmath4 ) , but leaves ( @xmath5 ) intact",
    ". there may exist copious other examples at high energy .",
    "perhaps the most compelling theoretical reason for baryon number violation comes from the need to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background and primordial deuterium abundance gives the ratio of baryon number density @xmath6 , to photon number density @xmath7 of @xcite : @xmath8 in a symmetric universe with @xmath9 , the nucleons and antinucleons would continue annihilating until @xcite : @xmath10 assuming the universe starts off in a symmetric state , there must be a dynamical mechanism ( baryogenesis ) , to create an asymmetry in baryon number .",
    "baryogenesis presumably occurred at some high temperature , @xmath11 , and possibly much higher .",
    "sakharov listed the three required conditions : ( i ) baryon number violation , ( ii ) c and cp violation , and ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "though there is some room for the non - perturbative sphaleron process to be the baryogenesis mechanism ( electroweak baryogenesis ) in susy scenarios , the parameter space is highly constrained .",
    "alternative scenarios for baryogenesis have therefore also been proposed ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , baryon number violation may arise quite generically in new high energy physics . in this case",
    ", there exists not only the bnv process which gives rise to baryogenesis , but also other sources of bnv as well .",
    "though not the mechanism for baryogenesis , these processes can affect the matter - antimatter asymmetry , even washing out an existing asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we can use this to place additional constraints on new physics models or alternatively , if such additional bnv were detected , it may even be possible to rule out certain baryogenesis mechanisms as the source of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry , as their contribution would simply be washed out by the additional bnv processes .",
    "leptogenesis , for example , creates an asymmetry in the lepton sector at high temperature .",
    "this asymmetry clearly has a @xmath1 component . the @xmath4 asymmetry is then reprocessed into an asymmetry in the baryon sector by the rapid ( @xmath12 ) violating , but @xmath1 conserving , sphaleron process .",
    "the introduction of additional bnv but ( @xmath5 ) conserving interactions simply increases the rate of reprocessing .",
    "the addition of rapid ( @xmath5 ) violating interactions , however , would lead to a washout of the entire asymmetry .    in this paper , we shall introduce baryon number violation by first augmenting the sm with scalar diquarks and leptoquarks .",
    "introducing interactions between these scalars then leads to baryon number violation .",
    "such interactions were originally motivated by charge quantization@xcite , and have been studied as a possible mechanism for baryogenesis@xcite .    since the diquarks and leptoquarks all carry electromagnetic and colour charge , the gauge interactions are too strong for the requisite departure from thermal equilibrium needed for baryogenesis to take place unless the new scalars have masses @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the phenomenology of these models at the lhc , that is with @xmath0 masses , so we will not be considering these interactions as a baryogenesis mechanism here .",
    "bnv interactions involving the first generation quarks are strongly constrained by nucleon stability .",
    "it is possible to use the nucleon stability results to put stringent limits on dimension six bnv operators ( the lowest dimension effective bnv operators possible ) involving the higher generations , meaning that bnv interactions are unlikely to be observed at the lhc @xcite .",
    "if some unknown gim - like cancellation mechanism were to suppress the nucleon instability , however , bnv interactions involving the top quark may become accessible at the lhc @xcite .    instead of searching for a gim - like cancellation mechanism , by examining the flavour structure of new physics models ,",
    "we concentrate on bnv that proceeds through multiple heavy scalars .",
    "each additional scalar of mass @xmath14 suppresses the amplitude of the nucleon decays by a factor of @xmath15 , so the nucleon stability experiments will put less stringent conditions on @xmath14 .",
    "we shall be looking at specific models , extending the sm with renormalizable terms .",
    "( the effective operators would then correspond to dimension nine or twelve , instead of the dimension six operators considered in refs.@xcite . )    in section.[sec : cat ] we review the possible scalar leptoquarks and diquarks and their bnv interactions .",
    "we examine the constraints from nucleon stability on one of the interactions , considering couplings to first and third generation quarks . in section.[sec : washout ] we analyse the effect such an interaction can have on baryogenesis , showing stringent limits apply for models which break the global @xmath1 symmetry . finally , in section.[sec : colliders ] we examine the phenomenology of this interaction at the lhc .",
    "detection of such bnv interactions may then allow us to rule out certain baryogenesis mechanisms , even if their mass scale lies outside the reach of present day colliders .",
    "the models studied in this paper are those introduced in ref.@xcite , and were motivated by charge quantization . here",
    "we use the same notation for the list of all possible scalar leptoquarks and diquarks , and their transformation under the sm gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "the convention here is that the scalar fields have the same quantum numbers as the quark and lepton bilinears : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and c is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "the standard model fermions and right - handed neutrinos transform in the usual way : @xmath19 note the leptoquarks in eq.([eq : list ] ) carry @xmath20 , and the diquarks @xmath21 . as we are breaking this symmetry ,",
    "the following particles then carry identical quantum numbers : @xmath22 such particles with both leptoquark and diquark couplings leads to baryon number violation .",
    "for example , taking the @xmath23 model the lagrangian is extended to include the terms : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless coupling constants , and generational and colour indices have been suppressed .",
    "if we take both yukawa couplings to the sm fermions to be @xmath27 , we obtain the following estimate of the proton decay rate on dimensional grounds ( see fig.[fig : pion])@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the proton mass . given the bound on the partial lifetime for @xmath30 , @xmath31 years @xcite , this translates to a limit on the mass of : @xmath32    , in a one exotic scalar extension with coupling to the first generation . ]    , in a one exotic scalar extension with coupling to the third generation . ]",
    "if we instead take the dominant coupling to be to the third generation , proton decay now proceeds through the diagram in fig.[fig : kaon ] .",
    "the decay rate is estimated as ( see appendix for details ) : @xmath33\\mathrm{ln}\\left[\\frac{m_{t}}{m_{\\tau}}\\right ] \\right)^{2 } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the weak coupling constant . given the limit on the partial lifetime for @xmath35 , @xmath36years@xcite , this translates to a limit on the mass of : @xmath37 this corresponds to  opening up \" the effective operator @xmath38 of ref.@xcite and is comparable to their limit on its coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "such bnv physics is then only accessible at the lhc if we assume a gim - like cancellation mechanism to avoid these stringent bounds .",
    "we will not investigate the possibility of such a mechanism here .",
    "instead we restrict our attention to the scalars which are not subject to this large mass bound , namely : @xmath40 .",
    "baryon number is then broken by the introduction of two scalars and an interaction between them .",
    "the possible scalar - scalar interactions , without the particles of eq.([eq : pairs ] ) , are listed below .",
    "the @xmath41 list is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the physical sm higgs scalar , @xmath44 represents a new higgs like scalar @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the components of the @xmath47 @xmath48 doublet .",
    "the @xmath49 list is : @xmath50 note that the models of eq.([eq : listtwo ] ) conserve ( @xmath5 ) while the models of eq.([eq : listthree ] ) break ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is an important distinction when it comes to consideration of the interaction s effects on baryogenesis . breaking baryon number using these scalar - scalar interactions leads to less stringent bounds from nucleon stability .    considering this shorter list",
    ", we will study the @xmath51 interaction in greater detail , due to its interesting phenomenology .",
    "first of all , it involves diquarks , which can be produced more favourably than leptoquarks in hadron colliders . secondly , @xmath52 couples to an up and down type quark .",
    "this means the possibility of top quarks in the final state , which is a clearer signal than generic jets . finally , for simplicity",
    ", we examine the @xmath48 singlet , @xmath52 , rather than the @xmath48 triplet , @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 particles in eq.([eq : list ] ) , are either scalar diquarks or scalar leptoquarks .",
    "the usual constraints , from low energy experiments , on the couplings of diquarks and leptoquarks to standard model fermions then apply . for example , from consideration of atomic parity violation of caesium , leptoquarks coupled to the right handed first generation fermions have a bound @xmath55tev @xcite . for further constraints on the leptoquarks ( in particular on products of different couplings )",
    "see refs.@xcite .",
    "products of diquark couplings are also constrained from limits on flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and meson - antimeson oscillations @xcite .",
    "these limits , however , do not apply in the limit where all but one of the couplings vanish .",
    "there are also constraints on the masses of leptoquarks and diquarks from collider experiments . from searches of pair produced leptoquarks",
    "the best limits for the three generations are @xcite : @xmath56 where we have indicated the final state searched for with @xmath57jet .",
    "diquarks can be produced singly at hadron colliders and then decay to two jets .",
    "it is then possible to exclude a given diquark given its coupling and mass from searches of dijet resonances @xcite . unlike the searches for pair produced leptoquarks",
    ", however , this diquark search is model dependent as the production occurs through the yukawa coupling to the sm quarks .    as noted before",
    ", such baryon number violating scalar interactions can also be the mechanism for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 model , studied in the rest of the paper , was proposed as a baryogenesis mechanism by the authors of ref.@xcite .",
    "the addition of a singlet scalar field , which decays out of equilibrium , allows the third sakharov condition to be met , even with @xmath58(tev ) masses for the coloured scalars .",
    "alternatively , colour triplet scalars with both diquark couplings to the sm and leptoquark coupling to a sm quark and a right handed majorana neutrino would also allow the third sakharov condition to be met @xcite .",
    "these papers also discuss the neutron - antineutron oscillations induced by such fields @xcite .    here",
    "we do not consider these particles as a baryogenesis mechanism , instead we obtain constraints from washout of baryogenesis .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we shall focus on the @xmath51 model .",
    "this model has the advantage of not containing any of the conjugate pairs of eq.([eq : pairs ] ) : recall that if the particle has both diquark and leptoquark couplings , the stringent limit on the mass of eq.([eq:3genmass ] ) applies .",
    "in addition the interaction @xmath51 can produce top quarks in the final state which would give an interesting signal at the lhc .",
    "furthermore , the production of single diquarks through the yukawa coupling is more favourable than leptoquarks at hadron colliders .",
    "the sm lagrangian is extended to include the terms : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 are dimensionless coupling constants and @xmath62 has dimension of mass .",
    "generational and colour indices have been suppressed .",
    "the exotic fields transform in the following way under the sm gauge interactions : @xmath63 we will primarily be interested in the @xmath64 hierarchy , especially for phenomenology at the lhc , which we study in sec.[sec : colliders ] .",
    "the couplings @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constrained from low energy experiments measuring fcnc and neutral meson oscillations .",
    "for example if the coupling to the third generation quarks @xmath65 , the coupling to the second generation quarks is constrained to be @xmath66 , for @xmath67tev or the @xmath68 oscillation frequency would exceed the experimental value @xcite .",

    ", the rate of oscillation is estimated as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mass of the neutron .",
    "the lower limit from experiment for the oscillation time is currently around @xmath73s @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , we obtain a bound : @xmath77 a similar constraint from dinucleon decay has previously been calculated@xcite .",
    "we have set @xmath76 as this ensures the two decay modes of @xmath78 have similar branching ratio . in the limit @xmath79 ,",
    "the bnv aspect of this model is switched off and no constraints from nucleon decay or washout exist .",
    "a small @xmath62 , however , makes the branching ratio for @xmath80 insignificant . detecting any bnv interaction at colliders then becomes even more unlikely .    the constraint on @xmath81 ,",
    "however , changes when the dominant coupling is taken to be to the third generation sm fermions .",
    "the most stringent constraint then comes from @xmath82 ( see figs.[fig : nloop],[fig : mloop ] ) , which has a partial lifetime @xmath83 years @xcite .",

    "if the particles couple predominantly to the third generation , we see that nucleon stability constraints do not preclude bnv from occurring at lhc energies .",
    "we will soon see , however , that far more stringent constraints arise from washout of baryogenesis .",
    "finally , let us mention an intermediate case where the @xmath78 couples to the first generation and the @xmath86 to the third .",
    "the limit on the mass again comes from @xmath70 oscillations ( see fig.[fig : inter ] ) .",

    "if baryogenesis were to occur before the temperature , @xmath89 , of the universe reached the mass scale of the @xmath54 particles , as would be the case in some high temperature leptogenesis scenario , the creation and decay of the @xmath54 particles in a @xmath90 sequence can erase the matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "for example , in the @xmath64 case such a sequence could proceed on - shell in the following way : @xmath91 if the rate of one of these steps , @xmath92 , is less than the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath93 , the @xmath90 process will not be occurring rapidly enough for washout @xcite .",
    "if we again take the @xmath74 , @xmath76 case we see to avoid washout we require : @xmath94 where @xmath95 specifies the degrees of freedom , @xmath96 is the planck mass , and we have included a lorentz factor for the typical rate . remembering that this is required to hold for all @xmath97 ( below which the initial inverse decay will be boltzmann suppressed ) , this translates into a washout avoidance condition on @xmath98 : @xmath99 this is a more stringent constraint than eq.([eq : low ] ) for @xmath100 masses",
    ". so washout of high temperature leptogenesis could take place with the addition of such fields , even with couplings only to the first generation ( which are the most constrained from nucleon stability ) .",
    "the addition of such fields with couplings greater than the above constraint , would mean any existing asymmetry in the quark sector above the mass scale of the @xmath54 particles will be removed by their bnv interactions .",

    "pair production of the scalars declines from @xmath126pb for @xmath127gev to @xmath128fb for @xmath129tev at @xmath123tev .",
    "taking @xmath125 , branching ratio @xmath130 for @xmath131 , and coupling of the scalars to the third generation quarks we have the final states of pair produced @xmath132 in table.i ( also see fig.[fig : gluons ] for an example of the decay chain ) .",

    "this scenario should therefore be taken as an illustration of the bnv signals accessible once the centre - of - mass energy is increased to @xmath123tev .",
    "such a clear signal , however , relies on careful selection of the parameters and should therefore be taken as a best case scenario .    .",

    "the precision study of such an interaction would be left to further experimental work .",
    "if the heaviest scalar mass is large , @xmath135tev , the washout condition is much weaker and a clearer bnv signal may occur albeit for a very specific choice of parameters .",
    "if such a choice is not realised we are again left with signals of multiple scalars . for masses greater than around @xmath136tev ,",
    "only the dijet signal governed by the yukawa coupling to first generation quarks is accessible at the lhc , pair production being too small for such masses .",
    "if we instead examine the @xmath1 conserving interactions of eq.([eq : listtwo ] ) we are left with leptoquark instead of diquark scalars .",
    "the washout constraint then does not apply , but being leptoquarks , these again would not be produced singly in large numbers at hadron colliders ( pair production through gluon - gluon fusion is still possible ) .",
    "that is , even in an optimistic scenario with em strength yukawa coupling , the production mechanisms @xmath137 and @xmath138 , only result in a cross section of 3.4fb@xcite and 10fb@xcite respectively for @xmath105tev at @xmath123tev at the lhc . but due to the nucleon stability constraints this coupling is expected to be small .",
    "so we expect bnv leptoquarks to only be pair produced in large numbers in a hadron collider ( not produced on their own ) .",
    "this again results in a @xmath9 initial state , making detection of the bnv interaction difficult .",

    "although the new scalars can be produced at the lhc , these stringent coupling constraints greatly inhibit any clear identification of such bnv interactions at the lhc .",
    "if the heaviest diquark has a mass higher than 4.5tev , the most stringent constraint again comes from nucleon stability .",
    "if the scalar coupling to the sm quarks then involves the higher generations , the couplings may be quite large , allowing for certain bnv processes to occur rapidly at lhc energies . in either case ,",
    "even if no bnv interaction is detected conclusively , the exotic particles would show up in other ways in the experiments",
    ". the discovery of multiple scalars would be interesting in itself , and once an overall picture emerged , the possibility of bnv in this sector of particles could be postulated .",

    "<S> baryon number violating ( bnv ) processes are heavily constrained by experiments searching for nucleon decay and neutron - antineutron oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> if the baryon number violation occurs via the third generation quarks , however , we may be able to avoid the nucleon stability constraints , thus making such bnv interactions accessible at the lhc . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study a specific class of bnv extensions of the standard model ( sm ) involving diquark and leptoquark scalars . after an introduction to these models </S>",
    "<S> we study one promising extension in detail , being interested in particles with mass of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate limits on the masses and couplings from neutron - antineutron oscillations and dineutron decay for couplings to first and third generation quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possible consequences of such a model on the matter - antimatter asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that for models which break the global baryon minus lepton number symmetry , @xmath1 , the most stringent constraints come from the need to preserve a matter - antimatter asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the bnv interaction can not be introduced if it would remove the matter - antimatter asymmetry independent of baryogenesis mechanism and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the phenomenology of such models at colliders such as the lhc . </S>"
