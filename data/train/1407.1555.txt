    "<S> we study the performance of supcode  a family of dynamically correcting pulses designed to cancel simultaneously both overhauser and charge noise for singlet - triplet spin qubits  adapted to silicon devices with electrostatic control . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both natural si and isotope - enriched si systems , and in each case we investigate the behavior of individual gates under static noise and perform randomized benchmarking to obtain the average gate error under realistic @xmath0 noise . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in most cases supcode pulses offer roughly an order of magnitude reduction in gate error , and especially in the case of isotope - enriched si , supcode yields gate operations of very high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a version of supcode that cancels the charge noise only , `` @xmath1-supcode '' , which is particularly beneficial for isotope - enriched si devices where charge noise dominates overhauser noise , offering a level of error reduction comparable to the original supcode while yielding gate times that are @xmath2 to @xmath3 shorter . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the supcode noise - compensating pulses provide a fast , simple , and effective approach to error suppression , bringing gate errors well below the quantum error correction threshold in principle .    ever since kane s original proposal for a silicon - based quantum computer,@xcite si has been a prime candidate as a host material for solid - state quantum computing.@xcite a decisive advantage of si </S>",
    "<S> is that it is available in an isotope - enriched form ( @xmath4si ) that has zero nuclear spin . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the nearly complete removal of decoherence due to the hyperfine interaction between the qubit and surrounding nuclear spins ( overhauser noise ) , leading to remarkably long coherence times and high control fidelity.@xcite recent years have witnessed substantial experimental progress in the fabrication , initialization , readout and control of spins in both phosphorous donors and gate - defined quantum dots in si systems.@xcite for a p donor qubit on si , both the donor electron spin@xcite and the nuclear spin@xcite have been explored as potential qubits , exhibiting coherence times up to 30 seconds and control fidelities exceeding 99.99% in recent experiments operating the qubit as a quantum memory,@xcite both of which are the highest achieved for any solid state qubit . in laterally defined si quantum dot systems , coherent operation of a singlet - triplet spin qubit@xcite has also been demonstrated.@xcite    while si qubits have been shown repeatedly to possess long information storage ( i.e. quantum memory ) times , it remains an open question on how to extend this long - lived coherence to qubits undergoing quantum gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have progressed to such a stage where high fidelity quantum gates are now within reach . </S>",
    "<S> while quantum devices built on isotope - enriched si already enjoy many advantages , some noise remains . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the residual @xmath5si impurities distort the wave function of the donor qubit or the lateral confinement potential of the quantum dot , which either broadens the esr resonance in the former case@xcite or shifts the exchange interaction in the latter,@xcite both causing inaccuracies in control . more importantly </S>",
    "<S> , additional errors can arise through electrical fluctuations from either the leads or nearby charged impurities , and from variations in control parameters.@xcite while a vast literature on dynamically corrected gates ( dcgs ) has existed long before the conception of spin qubits , it was only recently realized that the special constraints imposed by solid state spin systems often require brand - new approaches to developing dcgs.@xcite while one of these approaches , known as supcode,@xcite has already been experimentally demonstrated for nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond@xcite and is also applicable to single donor spins in si , it is particularly suitable for singlet - triplet qubits subject to overhauser and charge noise because it is designed to yield comparatively simple pulse sequences that cancel both while respecting all experimental constraints , including the restriction to positive , single - axis control . in the case of isotope - enriched si , however , canceling overhauser noise is no longer necessary , leaving open the possibility that robust quantum operations on si devices might be realized with even simpler and faster control sequences .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that supcode pulses can substantially improve gate fidelities in silicon singlet - triplet spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by quantifying the extent to which charge noise corrupts the application of individual quantum gates and demonstrate the cancelation of these errors effected by supcode pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we then provide a more systematic analysis of the performance of supcode by studying its effectiveness for long sequences of quantum gates subject to @xmath0 noise , which describes both overhauser and charge noise.@xcite through randomized benchmarking,@xcite we extract the average error per gate for the set of single - qubit clifford gates , and we find that supcode pulses remain robust against noise in this realistic situation . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a version of supcode that works particularly well for isotope - enriched si while being about 30% to 50% faster , and we demonstrate that it offers a level of error reduction comparable to the original version . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we discuss the applicability of supcode to @xmath0 noise with different exponents . </S>",
    "<S> these results illustrate that si quantum devices can achieve long coherence times not only when the qubit is idle but even while it is undergoing operations .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the model hamiltonian governing a singlet - triplet qubit,@xcite which can be realized in si either by gating exchange - coupled p donors@xcite or by a gate - defined double dot in a heterostructure:@xcite @xmath6}{2}\\sigma_z.\\ ] ] the computational bases are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 with @xmath10 creating an electron with spin @xmath11 in the @xmath12th dot . </S>",
    "<S> rotations around the @xmath13-axis are performed with a magnetic field gradient across the double - dot system , which in energy units reads @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic field gradient can be generated by a micromagnet , as demonstrated in si / sige quantum dot systems,@xcite where @xmath15 is approximately @xmath16 nev . </S>",
    "<S> rotations around the @xmath17-axis are done using the exchange interaction @xmath18 , the energy level splitting between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath18 is controlled by the detuning @xmath21 , namely the tilt of the double - well confinement potential , through the gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , @xmath18 can be tuned from close to zero up to tens of @xmath22ev.@xcite one therefore has fast , all - electrical control over the rotation rate around the @xmath17-axis . on the other hand , the magnetic field gradient @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> can not be changed efficiently during a gate operation , and we will take it to be constant throughout the computation .    in general , decoherence can arise through both @xmath15 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations arising from overhauser noise add a small , but unknown error term @xmath23 to the hamiltonian : @xmath24 . for natual si , @xmath23 is on the scale of nev , @xcite corresponding to a few percent of @xmath15 . however , for isotope - enriched silicon , @xmath23 can be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude,@xcite down to @xmath25 . on the other hand , impurities on the substrate </S>",
    "<S> lead to deformations of the confinement potential and consequently the energy level structure , thereby causing charge noise.@xcite this noise produces fluctuations in the exchange energy , @xmath1 , through fluctuations in the detuning @xmath21 . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we assume a phenomenological form of @xmath26 , implying @xmath27,@xcite but our method applies to other forms also.@xcite estimates of @xmath28 vary , ranging from 10% ( @xmath29ev ) @xcite to @xmath30 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study a range of @xmath31 values in this work .    </S>",
    "<S> we previously developed a family of composite pulses ( supcode ) that cancels both overhauser noise@xcite and charge noise.@xcite the basic idea is as follows : assuming the noise is quasi - static , one expands the evolution operator to first order in both @xmath23 and @xmath31 . in order to cancel these error terms , </S>",
    "<S> the original rotation is supplemented by an ( imperfect ) identity operation , carefully designed such that the error arising from performing this identity operation exactly cancels that of the target rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism reduces to a multi - dimensional optimization problem involving six coupled nonlinear equations ( corresponding to error terms for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , each of which has @xmath23 and @xmath31 components ) , from which the pulse sequence can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the theoretical framework is presented in ref .  , and we shall refer to these sequences as `` full supcode '' sequences in this work because they cancel both overhauser noise and charge noise .    while undoubtedly full supcode works for the problem at hand , further optimizations are possible for an isotope - enriched si system . because the overhauser noise is negligible in this case , one can completely ignore the @xmath23 component of the error , leading to a simplification of the problem since only three coupled nonlinear equations need to be solved , and the resulting sequences are much shorter and simpler . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we show pulse profiles comparing the full supcode and @xmath1-supcode for a hadamard gate . detailed sequences and pulse parameters for each of the single - qubit clifford gates are given in the appendix . in obtaining these results , we restricted the strength of the exchange to @xmath35 so that the resulting sequences are more feasible for experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> in the appendix we give explicit numerical results of the gate durations of @xmath1-supcode , and also show that @xmath1-supcode is about 30% to 50% shorter than the full supcode . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also show , in the remainder of this paper , that for parameter regimes of interest , the error reduction of @xmath1-supcode is comparable to that of full supcode for isotope - enriched si , making it particularly suitable for experimental realization in these systems .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) full supcode canceling both overhauser and charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath1-supcode canceling charge noise only.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the infidelity ( cf .  ref .  ) of the hadamard gate versus quasi - static charge noise strength . </S>",
    "<S> we model natural si as having @xmath36 , while isotope - enriched si has @xmath37 , consistent with experimental values.@xcite fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) shows the result for natural si . </S>",
    "<S> while the curve for the nave pulse saturates at an infidelity of about @xmath38 , the full supcode has a residual error of only @xmath39 for charge noise of less than @xmath40 , and if the quantum error correction threshold is set at @xmath30 , the range of charge noise that can be tolerated is as large as 5% . </S>",
    "<S> this is as expected because full supcode cancels both @xmath23 and @xmath31 errors . </S>",
    "<S> turning to the curve for @xmath1-supcode , we see that for most of the @xmath31 range ( @xmath41 ) , its performance is worse than the nave pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable because @xmath1-supcode completely ignores the overhauser noise , and this is precisely the range where overhauser noise is dominant .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the case of isotope - enriched si . from the different scale of the @xmath42-axis </S>",
    "<S> compared with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) one immediately notices that the gate error is substantially reduced for all three curves as expected for negligible overhauser noise . </S>",
    "<S> the exceedingly low errors achieved by the full supcode are consistent with the remarkably long coherence times measured in experiments.@xcite at a typical quantum error correction threshold of @xmath30 , the nave pulse tolerates charge noise up to @xmath40 , whereas the full supcode tolerates as much as @xmath43 . while this range does not differ from the case of natural si , the gate error for charge noise less than @xmath44 is substantially smaller due to the absence of overhauser noise . </S>",
    "<S> note that for the isotope - enriched si , @xmath1-supcode has low error comparable with full supcode for a wide range of noise amplitudes . even in the regime </S>",
    "<S> where it is not as effective as full supcode ( @xmath45 ) , the error is still greatly reduced compared to that of the nave pulse . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior is observed for all single - qubit clifford gates ( not shown here ) with the exception of @xmath13-rotations , where @xmath1-supcode has a constant error because charge noise does not come into play .     for ( a ) @xmath36 relevant to natual si and ( b ) @xmath46 relevent to isotope - enriched si . </S>",
    "<S> infidelity is shown for the nave pulse ( black solid ) , full supcode ( red dashed ) , and @xmath1-supcode ( blue dotted ) . </S>",
    "<S> note the different scales of the @xmath42-axis.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   for ( a ) @xmath36 relevant to natual si and ( b ) @xmath46 relevent to isotope - enriched si . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] are strongly indicative of the improvements afforded by supcode , a more complete characterization of this improvement is obtained by studying the error over long sequences of gates through randomized benchmarking.@xcite we have so far assumed a static noise model , which is a good approximation for single gates,@xcite but a more realistic model taking into account temporal variations of the noise is needed for longer gate sequences . to include these effects , </S>",
    "<S> we employ a @xmath0 noise model in which both the overhauser and charge noise have a power spectrum of the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes overhauser @xmath49 and charge noise @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the noise amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the exponent to be @xmath53 , which is consistent with the upper bound estimated from experiments.@xcite we have considered other values of @xmath54 , and the results will be presented later in the paper . </S>",
    "<S> we implement randomized benchmarking by averaging the fidelity over random sequences of single - qubit clifford gates and over different noise realizations for a varying number of gates in the sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of a sequence behaves as @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 is the average error per gate , and @xmath57 is the number of clifford gates applied.@xcite we fit our results to the exponentially decaying function @xmath58 , where the average error per gate is related to the fitted exponent via @xmath59 . </S>",

    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) shows the result for @xmath61 , relevant to natural si . </S>",
    "<S> these results are generated using the average of 200 independent realizations of noise / gate sequences , each of which contains up to 300 clifford gates . </S>",
    "<S> all curves asymptote to fidelity @xmath66 as expected , but the nave pulse and @xmath1-supcode drops to @xmath66 much more steeply , reaching the asymptotic value after less than 20 gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> full - supcode pulses , on the other hand , maintain the fidelity much longer , with 70% fidelity after 60 gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates that supcode pulses play a crucial role in error reduction . </S>",
    "<S> the result is consistent with that of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] in that when nuclear noise is present , @xmath1-supcode does not work well , even worse than a nave pulse . </S>",
    "<S> turning to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , the results for @xmath62 relevant to isotope - enriched si , we see a huge reduction in error . here </S>",
    "<S> we average over 100 independent realizations of the noise and gate sequences and increase the number of gates in each sequence to 500 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that even with the nave pulses , the fidelity remains larger than 80% after 400 gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> most remarkably , when supcode pulses are used , the fidelity remains greater than 95% even after 500 gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> this fact reinforces the main point of this paper : while isotope - enriched si is already superior to natural si , application of supcode reduces the error much further . </S>",
    "<S> we see again that @xmath1-supcode has an error reduction ability comparable with the full supcode , so it is particularly useful for isotope - enriched si since it is typically shorter , less complicated , and works almost perfectly when charge noise plays a much more significant role than overhauser noise .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed randomized benchmarking for different magnitudes of the charge noise , and these results are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , where we show the average error per gate , @xmath56 , obtained from the fitted decaying exponent . </S>",
    "<S> we note from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) that , for charge noise below 3% in natural si , the nave pulse has a gate error of approximately 10% . </S>",
    "<S> while this is a large error , it can be reduced by roughly one order of magnitude by the application of full supcode . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1-supcode carries larger error than the naive pulse as expected . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) shows the result for isotope - enriched si . </S>",
    "<S> the gate errors are again much lower than those of natural si : on a log - log plot the gate error of the nave pulses reduces linearly from around 1% for 3% charge noise , to @xmath67 for a charge noise of 0.1% . in this range , the gate error is further reduced by an order of magnitude when supcode pulses are used . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the @xmath1-supcode reduces error more than the full supcode which presumably arises from the simplicity of those pulses .     when nuclear noise is absent . </S>",
    "<S> the result of full - supcode is shown as the red dashed line and that of @xmath1-supcode is shown as the blue dotted line . </S>",
    "<S> the yellow area shows the regime where supcode reduces error.,width=302 ]    to understand better the applicability of supcode for different 1/f noises we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] the results of the supcode improvement ratio as a function of charge noise exponent , @xmath54 , when nuclear noise is absent . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement ratio is defined as the ratio between the average gate errors of nave and supcode pulses at asymptotically small charge noise . for a given exponent @xmath54 , </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is consistent for several different levels of small charge noise as indicated in the numerical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> although the results shown in fig .  [ fig4](b ) has a very small amount of nuclear noise , we can still see that the improvement ratio is approximately 10 and is consistent with the result of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . for large @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> , the noise is concentrated at low frequency which is precisely what supcode pulses are designed to correct , thus the improvement ratio increases exponentially as @xmath54 increases . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath54 the noises are more like white noise and performing supcode would not only be useless for noise correction , but also introduces more error due to the longer gate time which allows the error to accumulate more . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the supcode pulses are useful for @xmath68 and the improvement is much more pronounced if @xmath54 is further increased .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the performance of supcode for both static noise and @xmath0 noise in si ( natural and isotope - enriched ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that supcode is useful for @xmath0 noise with exponent @xmath68 in which case noise is concentrated at low frequency . in that regime , </S>",
    "<S> application of supcode reduces the gate error in a substantial way . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrated that @xmath1-supcode can perform comparably to the full supcode , so it is particularly useful for isotope - enriched si since it typically generates simpler and faster sequences . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the same protocol applies to two - qubit gates for single - spin qubits as well.@xcite our results clearly show that the extremely long coherence times of si qubits pertain not only to information storage but also to information processing , if supcode is applied . </S>",
    "<S> thus , si spin qubits may now be close to quantum error corrected fault tolerant quantum computing applications .    </S>",
