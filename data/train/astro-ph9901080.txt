    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are widely believed to be a thermonuclear explosion event of a white dwarf ( wd ) , although the immediate progenitors have not been identified yet . among many evolutionary paths toward sne ia proposed so far ,",
    "arguments are now focused on the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass model vs. the sub - chandrasekhar ( sub - ch ) mass model , and the single degenerate ( sd ) model vs. the double degenerate ( dd ) model ( e.g. , @xcite for a review of sn ia progenitors ) . of these models ,",
    "the sd & ch model is the most promising one both from the observational and theoretical points of view ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ; @xcite ) .",
    "one example of the sd & ch models is luminous super - soft x - ray sources ( ssss ) in which the wd accretes hydrogen - rich material at relatively high rates ( @xmath14 yr@xmath12 ) ( van den heuvel et al , 1992 ) .",
    "the wd accretes almost pure helium ( @xmath15 ) as a results of stable hydrogen shell - burning and experience helium shell flashes . in a strong flash ,",
    "the envelope expands greatly ( e.g. , @xcite ) and may suffer wind mass - loss or a roche lobe overflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if a large part of the helium layer will be lost by the wind , the wd hardly grows in mass to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is essentially important to estimate the efficiency of the net mass accumulation onto the c+o core .",
    "kato , saio , & hachisu ( 1989 , hereafter ksh89 ) has first estimated the mass accumulation efficiency in helium shell flashes .",
    "they used the old opacity , however , and it should be recalculated with the new opacity .    a new evolutionary path of the sd & ch scenario has been proposed by hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 ; hereafter hkn96 ) , in which a wd accretes hydrogen - rich matter from a lobe - filling red - giant ( wd+rg system ) . in this model ,",
    "optically thick winds blow from wds , which stabilize the mass transfer even if the donor has a deep convective envelope .",
    "the wd steadily accretes hydrogen - rich matter from the companion .",
    "its mass eventually reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit and the wd explodes as an sn ia .",
    "hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1999a , hereafter hkn99 ) show this wd+rg system is one of the main channels to sne ia .",
    "li & van den heuvel ( 1997 ) extended hkn96 s model to another type of binary systems consisting of a mass - accreting wd and a lobe - filling , more massive , somewhat evolved main - sequence star ( wd+ms system ) .",
    "hachisu & kato ( 1999 ) further proposed an evolutional path to binaries consisting of a wd and a somewhat evolved ms star characterized by helium - rich accretion as observed in u sco .",
    "this is another main channel to sne ia as shown by hachisu , kato , nomoto , & umeda ( 1999b , hereafter hknu99 ) .",
    "all of these models will experience helium shell flashes followed by optically thick winds during its way to an sn ia .",
    "if most of the helium matter is blown off in the wind , the wd can not grow to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath16 ) . therefore , once again it is essentially important to evaluate the efficiency of mass accumulation during the wind phase of helium shell flashes in order to reach the definite conclusion of sn ia progenitors .",
    "cassisi , iben & tornamb ( 1998 , hereafter cit98 ) criticized hkn96 s model and concluded that the white dwarf mass hardly increases to @xmath17 because of heavy mass loss owing to a roche lobe overflow during helium shell flashes .",
    "however , once the optically thick wind occurs during helium shell flashes , the wind velocity is as fast as @xmath11 km s@xmath12 , much faster than the orbital velocity ( @xmath13 km s@xmath12 ) so that the companion motion hardly affects the mass ejection .",
    "the wind matter quickly goes away from the system without any interaction to the orbital motion .",
    "therefore their argument has no physical meaning when a strong wind occurs .    in this _ letter _ , we have followed a full cycle of helium shell flashes including the mass loss owing to optically thick winds in order to obtain the mass accumulation efficiency of accreting wds .",
    "we have used the same techniques as in ksh89 but adopted opal opacity that has a strong peak around @xmath18 , which drives a strong wind as shown by kato & hachisu ( 1994 ) . in  2 ,",
    "we describe our methods , assumptions , and main results of helium shell flashes on a @xmath0 wd .",
    "discussions follow in  3 .",
    "kato , saio , & hachisu ( 1989 , ksh89 ) adopted two different approaches to follow a full cycle of helium shell flashes : time - dependent hydrostatic calculation and mimicking time - dependent behavior by a sequence of steady - state wind solutions .",
    "they combined these two methods , because the time - dependent henyey code failed when the envelope expands greatly while the steady - state approach works well .",
    "we have used the same basic approaches as in ksh89 to follow a full cycle of helium shell flashes on a @xmath0 wd .",
    "the main difference is in the wind solutions , which we replaced by the new solutions recalculated with the updated opal opacity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ignition models are unchanged because opal opacity gives essentially the same values as the old opacity does at higher temperatures of @xmath19 .",
    "we have assumed the same white dwarf radius of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath20 , and the envelope chemical composition of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for helium , carbon and oxygen , and heavy elements ( including c+o in solar ratio ) by weight , respectively .",
    "such a small helium content is expected as follows : in the early stage of a shell flash , the convection spreads over the entire envelope , then descends and disappears before the photosphere reaches the maximum expansion .",
    "the ashes of helium burning , i.e. , carbon and oxygen , is mixed into the entire envelope to reduce the helium content by about a half on average from the initial value of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we have assumed the uniform composition with @xmath21 in the quasi - evolutionary sequence . the convective energy transport is included in both the static and the wind solutions by the mixing length theory with the mixing - length parameter of 1.5 .",
    "the convection is , however , inefficient in the wind solutions , because a wind is too fast ( supersonic ) compared with the convective motion ( subsonic ) .",
    "( see @xcite for details . )",
    "figure 1 depicts evolutionary tracks of one cycle of helium shell flashes .",
    "after the onset of a shell flash , the helium layer expands to reach the maximum expansion of the photosphere , the radius of which depends on the ignition mass @xmath24 of the helium layer .",
    "we call this _ rising phase_. in the rising phase , the optically thick wind occurs when the photospheric temperature decreases to @xmath25 . after the maximum expansion , the photospheric radius decreases with the envelope mass and the star moves blueward in the hr diagram .",
    "after the wind stops , the envelope mass further decreases owing to nuclear burning and the star moves downward to come back to the original position .",
    "we call this _ decay phase_.    for the rising phase ,",
    "evolutionary tracks are approximated by a sequence of static solutions with a constant envelope mass until the optically thick wind occurs ( see ksh89 for details ) .",
    "three tracks have been calculated with ( a ) @xmath26 , ( b ) @xmath27 , and ( c ) @xmath28 .",
    "these ignition masses are realized for the helium accretion rates of ( a ) @xmath29 yr@xmath12 , ( b ) @xmath30 yr@xmath12 , and ( c ) @xmath31 yr@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the helium accretion rates of ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the largest rates of hydrogen steady shell - burning , @xmath32 , in the envelope with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , where @xmath35 is the eddington luminosity for electron scattering and @xmath36 is the nuclear energy release of hydrogen - burning per unit mass .",
    "thus @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath38 for the hydrogen content @xmath39 .",
    "such a low hydrogen content of @xmath33 ( or @xmath40 ) is expected in the helium - rich matter accretion in recurrent nova u sco ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evolutionary track for ( a ) @xmath26 is very close to the curve for the decay phase ( thick curve ) and omitted in figure 1 .",
    "no optically thick winds occur in this case because the photospheric temperature does not decrease to @xmath25 . at the maximum expansion",
    ", the photospheric temperature reaches @xmath41 ( indicated by arrow a ) , and the radius @xmath42 .    in the case of ( b ) @xmath27 ,",
    "the wind mass - loss begins at @xmath43 .",
    "the maximum expansion is reached at @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( indicated by arrow b ) , where the equality stands when we neglect the wind mass loss in the rising phase .",
    "the star moves blueward along the thick curve in the decay phase .",
    "the envelope mass is decreasing owing to wind and nuclear burning .",
    "the optically thick wind ceases at @xmath43 . in the third case of ( c ) @xmath28 ,",
    "the wind mass loss begins at @xmath46 , and the star reaches the maximum expansion at @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( indicated by arrow c ) .    these tracks for three different envelope masses merge into one track after the maximum expansion , because the envelope reaches a thermal equilibrium in the decay phase . the more massive the ignition mass is , the more redward the star moves in the hr diagram , that is , the star is traveling a longer track to a lower temperature",
    ". if the ignition mass is as large as @xmath49 , the star reaches @xmath50 .",
    "this envelope mass , @xmath51 corresponds to the ignition mass at @xmath52yr@xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows the photospheric temperature @xmath53 , the photospheric radius @xmath54 , and the photospheric wind velocity @xmath55 in the decay phase of helium shell flashes .",
    "the arrows indicate the same three ignition masses as in figure 1 . at the maximum expansion",
    ", the star reaches these position and then moves blueward as the envelope mass decreases owing to wind mass - loss and nuclear burning .",
    "the wind mass - loss stops at @xmath56 , marked by a filled circle .",
    "the photospheric velocity is as large as @xmath11 km s@xmath12 , which is much faster than the previous results ( @xmath57 km s@xmath12 in ksh89 ) , because of a strong acceleration driven by the large peak of opal opacity .",
    "the newly obtained wind velocities are much faster than the orbital velocities of sn ia progenitors of the wd+ms or wd+rg systems ( @xmath13 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore , we can neglect effects of the binary motion on the mass ejection during the common envelope phase , because the envelope matter quickly goes away with little interaction with the orbital motion .",
    "this implies that neither a roche lobe overflow nor a common envelope action plays an important role on mass ejection .",
    "figure 3 shows the total mass decreasing rate of the envelope @xmath58 , which is the sum of the wind mass loss rate @xmath59 and the mass decreasing rate owing to nuclear burning @xmath60 against the envelope mass @xmath61 for the decay phase of helium shell flashes .",
    "the processed matter accumulates at a rate higher than the mass ejection rate for the region of @xmath62 , and then a large part of the envelope matter accumulates on the white dwarf .",
    "these results are very different from the case of nova outbursts , in which most envelope mass is blown off .",
    "it is because the difference is in the nuclear energy release per unit mass between hydrogen - burning and helium - burning : hydrogen burning produces energy ten times larger than that of helium burning , i.e. , only a tenth of the hydrogen - rich envelope mass is enough to blow the entire envelope off .",
    "figure 4 shows the accumulation efficiency defined by the ratio of the processed matter remaining after one cycle of helium shell flash to the ignition mass .",
    "the amount of matter lost by the wind in the decay phase is calculated from the rate of wind mass - loss and nuclear burning in figure 3 .",
    "this accumulation ratio is well fitted by the solid curve expressed by @xmath63 where @xmath5 is in units of @xmath64 yr@xmath12 .",
    "cassisi et al ( 1998 , cit98 ) have followed the evolution of hydrogen - accreting white dwarfs .",
    "these wds are undergoing many cycles of hydrogen shell flashes until a strong helium shell flash develops to expand the envelope to a red - giant dimension .",
    "based on these calculations with the old opacity , they concluded that a hydrogen - accreting white dwarf will not become an sn ia , because almost all of the helium envelope is lost from the system by a roche lobe overflow or a common envelope ejection .",
    "cit98 further denied the possibility of hkn96 s scenario .    in",
    "what follows , we criticize cit98 s argument and support the growth of c+o wds as expected in hkn96 s and li & van den heuvel s ( 1997 ) models .",
    "cit98 calculated only much less massive white dwarfs of @xmath65 and @xmath66 to criticize @xmath67 model of hkn96 .",
    "the trends of the envelope expansion and the mass accumulation depend on the wd mass because of the large difference in the surface gravity ; nuclear energy release in helium burning is comparable to the gravitational potential energy for massive wds , i.e. , the ratio of nuclear / gravity is @xmath68 for a @xmath69 wd , whereas it is as large as @xmath70 for a @xmath66 wd , and @xmath71 for a @xmath72 wd . for massive wds , therefore , a large part of helium is consumed to produce nuclear energy before the envelope expands against the gravity .",
    "it reduces the helium content of the envelope .",
    "this low helium content in the envelope increases the burning speed in mass coordinates as understood from @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the nuclear energy release per unit mass for helium burning .",
    "thus , cit98 s criticism is inappropriate in the sense that their results for less massive wds can not be directly applied to very massive wds .",
    "once the optically thick wind occurs , a roche lobe overflow or a common envelope ejection discussed in cit98 becomes physically meaningless , because the wind velocity @xmath11 km s@xmath12 is much faster than the orbital velocity of the companion ( @xmath13 km s@xmath12 ) of typical sn ia progenitors ( wd+ms or wd+rg model ) .",
    "the wind goes away quickly without any effective acceleration by the companion . after the wind stops ,",
    "the photospheric radius ( @xmath75 ) is much smaller than the roche lobe ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "therefore , neither a roche lobe overflow nor a common envelope ejection works in our binary system .",
    "we have ignored hydrogen - rich envelope above the helium layer .",
    "an accreting 1.3 @xmath77 wd has a hydrogen - rich envelope of @xmath78 above the helium layer , depending on the mass transfer rate , chemical composition , and the other details of binary models .",
    "this is much smaller ( @xmath79 ) than the mass of the helium layer at ignition and we have neglected its contribution to the mass accumulation efficiency . the hydrogen - rich envelope will be quickly blown off at a very early stage of helium shell flashes .",
    "helium shell flashes may be observed as transient super - soft x - ray sources . for high mass accretion rates",
    "as expected in sn ia progenitors , shell flashes are so weak that the surface temperature never decrease to less than @xmath80 k. therefore , it will be a bright super - soft x - ray phenomenon with a faint optical counterpart . for a @xmath0 wd , the bright sss stage lasts @xmath81 yrs with recurrence period of a few tens to several tens of years . for more massive wds just before explosions",
    ", it lasts several months with the recurrence period of several years ."
