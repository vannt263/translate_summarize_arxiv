    "according to general relativity , the pseudo - riemannian manifold with signature ( 3,1 ) is a mathematical model of spacetime .",
    "the local properties of spacetime geometry are described by the einstein gravitational field equations .",
    "however , they do not specify the global spatial geometry of the universe , i.e.  its topology .",
    "this can only be constrained by observations .",
    "the concordance cosmological model assumes that the universe possesses a simply - connected topology , yet recently detected anomalies on large angular scales in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy suggest that it may be multiply - connected .",
    "evidence of such anomalies comes from the suppression of the quadrupole moment , alignment of the quadrupole and octopole and asymmetry in the temperature anisotropy observed in two hemispheres on the sky @xcite .",
    "the present constraints on topology were placed by studying two signatures of multi - connectedness in the cmb maps : the large scale damping of the power in the direction of a small dimension of the domain , which causes a breakdown of statistical isotropy @xcite , and the distribution of matched patterns @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we constrain the topology of the universe using the method of matched circles proposed by @xcite and apply it to the 7-year _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the majority of previous studies , we will pay special attention to the impact of galactic foreground residuals on the constraints .",
    "some consideration of this problem was made by @xcite in their analysis of the first year _",
    "wmap _ data release .",
    "we will use also monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for the estimation of the false detection level of the statistic .",
    "the method is applied to higher resolution maps than previously , which implies a lower level of false detection and therefore tighter constraints on the size of the universe . as a result of computational limitations",
    ", we will restrict the analysis to a search for back - to - back circle pairs .    in the following two sections we describe data used in analysis and simulations of the cmb maps for a flat universe with the topology of a 3-torus which were used to test the reliability of our implementation . the statistic adopted in our studies",
    "is presented in [ sec : statistic ] .",
    "the results and conclusions are described in the last two sections .",
    "the search for matched circles was performed on the 7-year _ wmap _ data @xcite .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "satellite observes the sky in five frequency bands denoted _ k _ , _ ka _ , _ q _ , _ v _ and _ w _ , centred on the frequencies of 22.8 , 33.0 , 40.7 , 60.8 , 93.5 ghz with angular resolutions of 52.8 , 39.6 , 30.6 , 21 and 13.2 , respectively .",
    "the maps are pixelized in the healpix scheme @xcite with a resolution parameter @xmath1 , corresponding to 3 145 728 pixels with a pixel size of @xmath2 arcmin .",
    "in particular we used the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map and the w - band map corrected for galactic emission outside of the applied mask using a template fitting scheme @xcite and smoothed with a gaussian beam profile of full width at half - maximum @xmath3 to decrease noise level .",
    "the former has been used for a number of full sky analyses , and versions available with earlier data releases have already been exploited in the search for matched circles .",
    "the latter is the highest angular resolution data measured by the _ wmap _ satellite . since the false detection level for such a map is lower , it provides the opportunity to estimate tighter constraints on topology .",
    "we elected not to use data preprocessed as in @xcite , i.e. a noise - weighted combination of the q , v and w - band maps smoothed to q - band map resolution outside of the kp2 galactic cut , and the ilc map within this region .",
    "such a map has complex properties since it consists of two regions with different angular resolutions ; moreover , as we will see the ilc map remains too contaminated by galactic foreground residuals inside the kp2 cut to be used for cosmological analysis .",
    "to test the reliability of codes used to search for the signature of a multi - connected topology in the universe , we performed simulations of cmb skies for a flat universe with the topology of a 3-torus @xcite .",
    "the simulations can be made in two ways : one can compute the covariance matrix of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xcite and then generate correlated @xmath6 coefficients using the choleski decomposition of the covariance matrix @xmath7 and uncorrelated unit variance gaussian variable @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or one can directly compute the @xmath4 coefficients using equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is difference between the present conformal time @xmath12 and the time of recombination @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the density perturbation power spectrum , @xmath15 is the response function for temperature , @xmath16 is a gaussian random variable which satisfies @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the volume of the fundamental domain .",
    "the sum over wavevectors @xmath19 was split into two sums @xmath20  the sum over all possible magnitudes of the @xmath19 vector and over all @xmath19 of magnitude @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is a less aggressive scaling in the computation time , @xmath22 ( number of @xmath4 coefficients @xmath23 times number of wave modes @xmath24 ) in comparison with the former that goes as @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the disadvantage of the latter approach is that for each simulation we have to repeat the computations .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to adopt this method since the difference in scaling is particularly significant for the high resolution maps of interest in our studies .",
    "we also do not need more than one map for a given topology to evaluate the possibility of detection .",
    "the topology does not affect local physics , so the equations governing the evolution of cosmological perturbations are left unchanged .",
    "thus , to compute the response functions , @xmath26 , one can use the publicly available camb code @xcite .",
    "a change of topology translates into a change of the modes that can exist in the universe .",
    "therefore , we need to compute the response function only for a set of allowed wave numbers @xmath21 . to speed up computations , we use in our code",
    "precomputed response functions .",
    "then , the most time consuming part is the computation of the sum @xmath27 .",
    "the simulations do not include gravitational lensing of the cmb as the lensing deflection angle is small @xcite , @xmath28 , compared to the minimal angular scale taken into account in the simulations , @xmath29 .",
    "the effect of the finite thickness of the last scattering surface is included in the simulations through the response function , @xmath26 , computed by camb .",
    "however , the effect starts to be important at angular scales smaller than @xmath30 and will therefore not be studied here .      to study the signatures of a given topology , a cmb map is required with resolution comparable to the angular size of the beam profile used to smooth the _ wmap _ w - band data ( i.e.  @xmath29 ) to be analysed here ( see [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "we have adopted @xmath31 in our simulations .",
    "the dimension of the fundamental domain of the 3-torus was @xmath32 , which is about three times less than diameter of the observable universe i.e.  @xmath33 .",
    "in such a universe there are many pairs of matched circles of different radii . the time needed for the generation of one such cmb map on a single processor with clock speed 3 ghz is about 42 hours .",
    "if light had sufficient time to cross the fundamental cell , an observer would see multiple copies of a single astronomical object . to have the best chance of seeing ` around the universe ' we should look for multiple images of the furthest reaches of the universe . searching for multiple images of the last scattering surface ",
    "the edge of the visible universe  is then a powerful way to constrain topology .",
    "because the surface of last scattering is a sphere centred on the observer , each copy of the observer will come with a copy of the last scattering surface , and if the copies are separated by a distance less than the diameter of the last scattering surface , then they will intersect along circles .",
    "these are visible by both copies of the observer , but from opposite sides .",
    "the two copies are really one observer so if space is sufficiently small , the cmb radiation from the last scattering surface will demonstrate a pattern of hot and cold spots that match around the circles .",
    "the idea of using these circles to study topology is due to @xcite .",
    "therein , a statistical tool was developed to detect correlated circles in all sky maps of the cmb anisotropy  the circle comparison statistic @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the temperature fluctuations around two circles of angular radius @xmath38 centered at different points , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , on the sky with relative phase @xmath41 .",
    "the sign @xmath42 depends on whether the points along both circles are ordered in a clockwise direction ( phased , sign @xmath43 ) or alternately whether along one of the circles the points are ordered in an anti - clockwise direction ( anti - phased , sign @xmath44 ) .",
    "this allows the detection of both orientable and non - orientable topologies . for orientable topologies the matched circles have anti - phased correlations",
    "while for non - orientable topologies they have a mixture of anti - phased and phased correlations .",
    "the statistic has a range over the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "circles that are perfectly matched have @xmath46 , while uncorrelated circles will have a mean value of @xmath47 . to find matched circles for each radius @xmath38 , the maximum value @xmath48 is determined .    in order to speed up the computations",
    ", one can use the fast fourier transform ( fft ) along the circles , @xmath49 , and , by rewriting the statistic as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , use inverse fast fourier transform .",
    "it reduces the computational cost @xmath52 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 operations , where @xmath55 is number of pixels in the map .",
    "in our studies we will use the statistic as modified in @xcite to include weighting of the @xmath56th harmonic of the temperature around the @xmath39th circle @xmath57 by the factor @xmath58 that takes into account the number of degrees of freedom per mode : @xmath59 where the fourier coefficients @xmath57 are complex conjugated in the case of the @xmath60 statistic",
    ". such weighting enhances the contribution of small scale structure relative to the large scales fluctuations .",
    "it is especially important because the large scale fluctuations which are dominated by the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "this can obscure the image of the last scattering surface and reduce the ability to recognise possible matched patterns on it .",
    "the general search explores a six dimensional space : the location of the first circle centre , @xmath61 , the location of the second circle centre , @xmath62 , the angular radius of the circle @xmath38 , and the relative phase of the two circles @xmath41 . the number of operations needed to search for circle pairs scales as @xmath63 ; thus implementation of a matched circles test is computationally very intensive .",
    "because of this we will restrict our analysis to a search for pairs of circles centered around antipodal points , so called back - to - back circles .",
    "then , the search space can be reduced to four dimensions and the number of operations to @xmath64 .",
    "we will not search for nearly back - to - back circles as in @xcite , neither can we apply their hierarchical approach to speed up computations . in our case , we perform an analysis of high resolution maps ( @xmath65 ) , so that the approach of initially degrading them to a lower resolution and then refining the search in higher resolution maps only for those circle pairs with the highest correlations risks missing some pairs of circles . as a consequence ,",
    "our analysis is more computationally demanding than the analysis done by @xcite preventing the study of a more general class of topologies .",
    "although the back - to - back search can detect a large class of the topologies that we might hope to find , there remain those topologies that predict matched circles without antipodal configurations such as the hantzsche - wendt space for flat universes or the picard space for hyperbolic universes @xcite .",
    "we used the healpix scheme with resolution parameter @xmath66 to define our search grid on the sky . to accommodate the use of the fft approach , @xmath67 points are used for each circle , where @xmath40 corresponds to resolution parameter of the map given by @xmath68 . by definition",
    "this is also the angular resolution used to step through @xmath69 . for @xmath38",
    ", we used steps a little bit smaller than characteristic scale @xmath70 of coherent structures in the map , i.e.  @xmath71 .",
    "the scale of coherence was approximated by the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a gaussian beam profile used to smooth maps .",
    "the values of the temperature anisotropy at each point along the circle were interpolated based on values for the four nearest pixels with weights inversely proportional to the distances between a given point and the pixel centers .",
    "other methods of interpolation can be used but we have verified that even using the temperature value of the nearest pixel does not change the value of the statistic significantly .    to draw any conclusions from an analysis based on the statistic @xmath72 it is very important to correctly estimate the threshold for a statistically significant match of the circle pairs .",
    "the chance of random matches is inversely proportional to the number of coherent structures along the circles , therefore a false positive signal level of the statistic is especially large for circles with smaller radii .",
    "we used simulations of the maps with the same noise properties and smoothing scales as the _ wmap _ data to establish the threshold such that fewer than 1 in 100 simulations would yield a false event .",
    "it is important to note that the false detection level is smaller for higher resolution maps .",
    "conversely , as shown by @xcite , the value of the statistic for matched circles @xmath73 depends on the ratio of the signal rms @xmath74 to the noise rms @xmath75 ratio , denoted @xmath76 for the map , thus the efficiency of the statistic to detect matched circles is increased by smoothing the data .",
    "a smoothing scale should therefore be adopted that is a reasonable trade - off between these two requirements .    to eliminate the regions most contaminated by galactic foreground residuals",
    ", we utilise the masks defined by the _ wmap _ team .",
    "however , the statistic is very sensitive to the masking , particularly if a significant fraction of one or both circle pairs lies in the masked region . in this case",
    ", there is a significant probability to find a chance correlation of the temperature pattern between unmasked parts of the circles , thus increasing the false detection level .",
    "the effect is the most pronounced for circles with the largest radii , close to 90 degrees , as well with very small radii . to avoid this",
    ", we restrict our analysis to those pairs for which less than half the length of each circle is masked .",
    "though , the statistic computed in this way is not optimal , it is much more robust with respect to masking .",
    "it should be noted that the dependence of the statistic on the cut could be avoided if the statistic were expressed as a function of the number of coherent structures along the circles .",
    "however , because our principal goal is to constrain the size of the universe it is better to use the statistic determined as a function of circle radius .",
    "finally , @xcite have suggested that the performance of the statistic ( [ eqn : s_statistic_fft ] ) may be further improved by bandpass filtering the input map to minimise the anisotropy contribution from the isw and doppler terms which blur any signatures of topology present on the last scattering surface .",
    "we chose not to apply this kind of filtering because of possible complications arising from the interaction of the mask and the filter .",
    "our analysis is enhanced by the use of high resolution maps rather than filtering .",
    "before beginning the search for pairs of matched circles in the _ wmap _ data , we validated our algorithm using simulations of the cmb sky for a universe with 3-torus topology for which the dimension of the cubic fundamental domain @xmath32 , and with cosmological parameters corresponding to the @xmath77 model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 3 ) determined from the 7-year _ wmap _ results .",
    "in particular , we verified that our code is able to find all pairs of matched circles in such map .",
    "the statistic @xmath78 for the map is shown in [ fig : smax_t222 ] .",
    "note that the peak amplitudes in the statistic , corresponding to the temperature correlation for matched circles , decrease with radius of the circles .",
    "@xcite , noted that this is primarily caused by the doppler term which becomes increasingly anticorrelated for circles with radius smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "the temperature match on the last scattering surface will be also diluted by the isw effect which comes from the evolution of the structures close to the observer .",
    "however , to a large extent the @xmath56 weighting used in the statistic ( [ eqn : s_statistic_fft ] ) mitigates against this and prevents the statistic from being dominated by the large scales .",
    "the intersection of the peaks in the matching statistic with the false detection level estimated for the w - band data ( the same as in [ fig : smax_wmap_w ] ) defines the minimum radius of the correlated circles which can be detected for this map .",
    "the height of the peak with the smallest radius seen in [ fig : smax_t222 ] indicates that the minimum radius is about @xmath0 . to emphasise the advantage of using higher resolution data in the analysis",
    ", we also show the false detection level estimated for the ilc map ( the same as in [ fig : smax_wmap_ilc ] ) . in this case , the minimum radius for detectable matched circles is about @xmath80 .",
    "the statistics for the _ wmap _ ilc map are shown in [ fig : smax_wmap_ilc ] .",
    "the map was analyzed on both the full sky and after applying the kq85y7 mask @xcite . in the case of the full sky analysis , the @xmath81 statistic shows some excess for pairs of circle with large radii .",
    "nevertheless , after removing the most foreground contaminated regions the statistic does not reveal any unusually large values .",
    "this indicates that residuals of the galactic emission , especially in the galactic plane , can not be neglected in the analysis of matched circles .",
    "it is interesting that similar behaviour is not seen for a full sky analysis of the first year _",
    "this probably explains why the importance of masking the most contaminated regions was not recognised in previous papers using the matched circles statistic , the only exception being the paper by @xcite .",
    "however , because they studied only the first year _ wmap _",
    "data , they also came to the conclusion that the ilc map is good enough for the full sky analysis .",
    "we checked that the excess is not related to the bias correction ( for residual foreground emission ) applied to the 7-year ilc map by the _ wmap _",
    "team since this was not implemented for the first year data .",
    "indeed , the excess remains present for the 7-year ilc constructed by simply coadding the individual frequency channels with the weights provided in @xcite .",
    "deeper studies of this problem are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a further warning against the naive use of a full sky ilc map for cosmological analysis , and particularly with respect to the two - point correlation function which is closely related to the statistic used here resolution . ] .    the false detection level shown in [ fig : smax_wmap_ilc ]",
    "was estimated on the basis of 100 simulations of the ilc map with the kq85y7 mask applied , assuming a simple - connected universe and established from the requirement that fewer than 1 in 100 simulations should yield a false match .",
    "we did not correct the simulated maps for the bias coming from the random correlation between the cmb and the galactic foreground , since the effect is small outside of the galactic plane region .",
    "moreover , such a correction does not appear to be reliably evaluated as demonstrated with simulations that have been generated using the same foreground templates as for the simulated ilc maps .",
    "maps corrected in this way do not properly reflect uncertainties concerning details of the galactic emission , especially in the galactic plane .    for comparison",
    "we show also the false detection level estimated on the basis of a ` scrambled ' version of the ilc map ( i.e. by randomly exchanging the @xmath56 spherical harmonic coefficients , @xmath4 , of the map at every @xmath82 ) as in @xcite . however , we still applied the kq85y7 mask for each ` scrambled ' map to be consistent with simulations of the ilc data .",
    "as can be seen , the false detection level is slightly lower in this case .",
    "it is not surprising because the scrambling generates maps with the same two - point function and only different phase correlations that results in a smaller variance of the @xmath83-statistic than for an ensemble of simulated ilc maps .    in order to decrease the false detection level and be able",
    "to detect matched circles with smaller radius , we analyzed also the _ wmap _ data with the highest angular resolution i.e.  the w - band map , corrected for galactic foregrounds and smoothed with a gaussian beam profile of @xmath84 to decrease the noise level .",
    "the statistic for this map analysed with the kq85y7 mask is shown in [ fig : smax_wmap_w ] .",
    "as for the ilc map , the false detection level was estimated from 100 simulations of the w - band data .",
    "we did not find any statistically significant correlation of circle pairs in either map .",
    "as seen in [ fig : smax_t222 ] , the minimum radius at which the peaks expected for the matching statistic are larger than the false detection level is about @xmath85 for the w - band map .",
    "thus , we can exclude any topology that predicts matching pairs of back - to - back circles larger than this radius .",
    "this implies that in a flat universe described otherwise by the best - fit 7-year _ wmap _ cosmological parameters , a lower bound on the size of the fundamental domain is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "of course , the above constraints do not apply to those universes for which the orientation of the matched circles is impossible to detect due to partial masking on the sky .",
    "examples of topologies which can be overlooked are so called slab and chimney spaces @xcite . for such topologies and appropriate configuration , all pairs of matched circles could lie in the galactic plane that is removed by the mask . the probability of overlooking the circles",
    "depends on the specific topology and radii of the circles , so it is difficult to give a general expression .",
    "nevertheless , one can suppose that it decreases as the fraction of the masked sky decreases .",
    "we have studied constraints on the topology of the universe using the method of matched circles as applied to the 7-year _ wmap _ ilc map and the foreground - reduced w - band map .",
    "we paid special attention to three aspects of the analysis that have been neglected in previous studies  the application of a mask , the use of high resolution data and the estimation of the false detection level on the basis of detailed mc simulations of the sky maps .",
    "the necessity for the application of a mask is due to the presence of residual galactic foreground emission present even in the ilc map .",
    "these introduce a non - negligible effect on the matched circles statistic that is used for constraining topology . however , the possibility to apply the analysis to masked maps yields the opportunity to more tightly constrain topology by using higher resolution , foreground corrected _ wmap _ w - band data .",
    "constraints on the topology depend significantly on the threshold for a significant match of the circle pairs .",
    "in order to estimate this correctly , we used 100 mc simulations of the ilc and w - band maps assuming a simply - connected universe .",
    "the level of false detection calibrated in this manner is slightly higher than that derived in @xcite using a method in which the analyzed maps are resampled by shuffling their spherical harmonic coefficients .",
    "although the difference is not very big , it is worth noting that the constraints on the size of universe are overestimated if one uses a lower level of false detection .",
    "the analysis of the _ wmap _ w - band map , after correction using templates of galactic foreground emission , did not reveal any significant correlations for pairs of back - to - back circles with a radius greater than @xmath88 .",
    "this substantially extends the previous constraint on the minimum radius of detectable matched circles given by @xcite of @xmath89 .",
    "it also places a lower bound on the size of fundamental domain of about 27.9 gpc for a flat universe described by the best - fit 7-year _ wmap _ cosmological parameters .",
    "although this constraint concerns only those universes with such dimensions and orientation of the fundamental domain with respect to the mask that allow the detection of pairs of matched circles , the probability of overlooking circle pairs is rather low for the kq85y7 mask that removes only a relatively small fraction of the sky .    of course , observations of the cmb with higher angular resolution and significantly lower noise level by the _ planck",
    "_ satellite may yield even tighter constraints on the topology of the universe .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the possible improvement in the lower bound on the size of the universe will not be substantial .",
    "the current constraint is not much smaller than the diameter of the observable universe @xmath90 , which imposes an upper limit on the size of the fundamental domain that it is possible to detect using the method of matched circles .",
    "the only significant improvement might be related to improved modeling of the galactic emission allowing the application of a smaller mask approaching closer to the galactic plane .",
    "this would minimize the probability of overlooking topologies with matched circles that are hidden within the masked region of the sky .    finally , as in @xcite , the studies",
    "could also be extended to search for nearly back - to - back circle pairs .",
    "however , the much higher computational requirements for the analysis of high resolution maps make such studies difficult and extremely time - consuming .",
    "nevertheless , we can hope that the steadily increasing speed of processors and availability of larger computational resources will make such computations feasible in the coming years , thus allowing a final resolution of the problem of the topology of our universe .",
