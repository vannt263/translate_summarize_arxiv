    "coalgebras @xcite form a powerful theory of state - based transition systems where definitions and results are formulated at a high level of genericity that covers several families of systems at once , from deterministic automata and kripke frames to different kinds of probabilistic models . traditionally , these formulations are elaborated in a set - based context ; _ i.e. _  no further structure in the system s state space than that of a set is assumed . in many cases ,",
    "however , a switch of context is needed .",
    "the projects on the coalgebraic foundations of stochastic systems , where the giry functor and measurable spaces have a central role ( _ cf._@xcite ) , are evident examples of this .",
    "research on coalgebras over stone spaces ( _ e.g._@xcite ) and coalgebras over pseudometric spaces @xcite forms equally important cases . in @xcite ,",
    "the aim is to provide a suitable coalgebraic semantics for finitary modal logics by taking advantage of a vietoris functor , while in @xcite is to introduce a notion of distance between states .    in this paper",
    "our focus is on coalgebras over arbitrary _ topological spaces _ , because we believe that they provide important mechanisms to the design and analysis of _ hybrid systems _ @xcite .",
    "briefly put , hybrid systems are those that possess both discrete and continuous behaviour , a result of the complex interaction between digital devices , and physical processes like velocity , movement , temperature , and time .",
    "two recurring examples are the cruise control system , basically a digital device with influence over velocity , and the _ bouncing ball_. in the latter , movement and velocity have a continuous nature , while the impact on the ground is assumed to be a discrete event that instantaneously alters the current velocity .",
    "as we will see in the following sections , such an interaction between discrete and continuous behaviour calls for a shift from the set - based setting to richer contexts , in particular to topological ones so that suitable notions of stability , bisimulation , and behaviour can be obtained .",
    "these are the practical motivations for the theoretical results that this paper provides .",
    "but we stress that coalgebras over topological spaces have the potential for much more ",
    "the works @xcite , for example , elegantly attest this .",
    "our results are therefore applicable to a much broader context than that of hybrid systems .",
    "each functor @xmath0 induces a category of coalgebras @xmath1 that can be seen as a framework for a particular family of state - based transition systems , whose transition type is determined by @xmath0 ( _ cf . _",
    "the powerset @xmath2 , for example , often associated with non - deterministic behaviour , gives rise to kripke frames .",
    "in such a context , the systematic study of ( co)limits in categories of coalgebras is a natural research line .",
    "in fact , final coalgebras , which form a specific type of limit , are often searched for , as they encode a canonical notion of behaviour for all @xmath3-coalgebras .",
    "another special kind of limit , equalisers of coalgebras , is extensively used in coalgebraic specification ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "it provides a notion of subsystem , and is essential to characterise a system induced by a set of coequations .      as mentioned before , this paper concerns coalgebras over arbitrary topological spaces .",
    "more concretely , coalgebras whose underlying functor is defined over the category @xmath4 of topological spaces and continuous maps .",
    "analogously to what has already been done in @xmath5 ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) , the aim here is to investigate the existence of limits in categories of coalgebras whose underlying functor is _ * vietoris polynomial * _  the topological analogue of a kripke polynomial functor .",
    "the former is called ` vietoris polynomial ' because it arises from the composition of different vietoris functors @xcite ( the topological analogues of the powerset functor ) with polynomial functors over @xmath4 .",
    "to keep the nomenclature simple , we call every coalgebra whose underlying functor is vietoris polynomial a _ * vietoris coalgebra*_.    as composites of constant , ( co)product , identity , and powerset functors , kripke polynomial functors have long since been recognised as a particularly relevant class of functors ( _ cf._@xcite ) .",
    "they are intuitive and the corresponding coalgebras subsume several types of state - based systems .",
    "moreover , they are well - behaved in regard to the existence of limits in their categories of coalgebras if the powerset functor is submitted to certain cardinality restrictions .",
    "we will see that somewhat similar results hold for vietoris polynomial functors as well .",
    "actually , an instance of a vietoris functor , which we call _ * compact vietoris functor * _ , has already been studied multiple times in the coalgebraic setting ( _ e.g._@xcite ) , and will appear in a book on coalgebras that is currently in preparation @xcite . in particular , @xcite shows that compact vietoris polynomial functors in the category @xmath6 of stone spaces and continuous maps admit a final coalgebra .",
    "also , document @xcite presents a theorem that can be generalised to show that the compact vietoris functor in the category @xmath7 of compact hausdorff spaces and continuous maps , admits a final coalgebra .",
    "in fact , this generalised result is also implicitly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "related to this , but in a broader setting , we collect a number of results scattered in coalgebraic and topological literature , and    * add to this collection some results of our own .",
    "in particular , we generalise hughes theorem ( theorem [ theo_hughes ] ) and prove that , under certain conditions , functors between categories of coalgebras are _ topological _ @xcite .",
    "topological functors have powerful properties such as the existence of left and right adjoints , lifting of limits , and lifting of factorisations .",
    "* this collection of results allows us to obtain several new results about limits in categories of vietoris coalgebras .",
    "for example , that categories of polynomial coalgebras over @xmath4 are complete , and that categories of compact vietoris coalgebras over @xmath7 are complete as well .",
    "using in particular ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma b ) , we also show that categories of compact vietoris coalgebras are complete in the category @xmath8 of hausdorff spaces and continuous maps .",
    "moreover we will see that all categories of vietoris coalgebras over @xmath4 have equalisers .",
    "* we then take advantage of the limit - preserving properties of the inclusion functors @xmath9 and @xmath10 to show that every compact vietoris polynomial functor @xmath11 that can be restricted either to @xmath7 or @xmath8 admits a final coalgebra .",
    "our setting is a broader one also because we consider different instances of vietoris functors , a particular case being what we call the _ * lower vietoris functor * _ , studied in a coalgebraic setting in @xcite .",
    "* we will show that every lower vietoris polynomial functor behaves well in the category @xmath12 of stably compact spaces and spectral maps .",
    "in particular , that its category of coalgebras is complete . * in order to extend these results to more variants of vietoris functors , we study the existence of adjunctions between categories of coalgebras .",
    "one positive result is that , assuming the existence of a monomorphic natural transformation between the underlying functors , such an adjunction exists under mild conditions .    to illustrate the practical side of these developments , and , more generally , the potential of coalgebras over @xmath4 to the design and analysis of hybrid systems , we argue that the coalgebraic specification in @xmath5 of the bouncing ball has some deficiencies . among them ,",
    "the incapability to reason about the system s stability , and the non - existence of a suitable final coalgebra if non - determinism is taken into account .",
    "we will see that these issues can be solved , to some extent , by adopting the category @xmath4 as the underlying semantic universe .",
    "the ensuing section introduces some categorial notions , provides an overview , and extends some results about limits in categories of coalgebras .",
    "then , it formally reviews the concept of vietoris coalgebra and different instances of vietoris functors  as already mentioned , our agenda has a broader scope than most coalgebraic literature on vietoris functors , which mainly focuses on one specific case .",
    "section [ sec_limits ] starts with our study about polynomial coalgebras over @xmath4 , and topological functors between categories of coalgebras .",
    "then , it adds two instances of vietoris functors ( the lower and the compact ) to the mix which , as expected , introduce a number of difficulties .",
    "a number of topological concepts are recalled at this point to help us achieve some of the results mentioned above .",
    "section [ sec_morelimits ] explores the existence of adjunctions between categories of coalgebras induced by natural transformations relating functors on the underlying categories .",
    "as already stated , this allows to extend the results of the previous section to subfunctors of vietoris polynomial ones , thus covering at once several variants of vietoris functors .",
    "section [ sec_work ] illustrates an application of this work to the design of hybrid systems .",
    "finally , section [ sec_conc ] suggests possible research lines for future work and concludes .",
    "we assume that the reader has basic knowledge of category theory @xcite , topology @xcite , and coalgebras @xcite .",
    "some categorial notions that the reader may not frequently meet will be used .",
    "this section provides a brief overview about them .",

    "then , since the map @xmath467 is an embedding , and @xmath468 , there must be a unique arrow @xmath469 such that @xmath470 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath471 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the diagram above being commutative , and the map @xmath472 mono .",
    "even if most coalgebraic literature takes @xmath5 as the base category , state - based transition systems often call for a shift to other categories , where mechanisms that suitably handle their intricacies are available .",
    "such was the case in @xcite , two research lines on the topic of stochastic systems , and in @xcite , where the category of stone spaces and continuous maps plays a key role in setting an appropriate coalgebraic semantics for finitary modal logics .",
    "in our case the base category adopted was @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this was because the @xmath5-based context proved to be insufficient for the design of ( non - deterministic ) hybrid systems , namely in what concerns canonical representations of behaviour and stability .",
    "the shift to the topological setting provided , almost for free , a notion of stability ( in the spirit of @xcite ) , and showed that a number of non - deterministic hybrid systems in @xmath4 have an associated final coalgebra , even if in @xmath5 they do not .",
    "both results were achieved using this paper s theoretical developments . but again , we stress that the latter can be applied to other contexts as well .",
    "the relevance of vietoris coalgebras for different topics is further witnessed by the common existence of important limits in their categories of coalgebras .",
    "we saw that every compact vietoris polynomial functor admits a final coalgebra if it can be restricted to the category @xmath8 while every lower vietoris polynomial functor admits a final coalgebra if it can be restricted to @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , we saw that several variants of such functors also inherit these results and that all categories of vietoris coalgebras have equalisers .",
    "however , several theoretical questions concerning limits in categories of vietoris coalgebras still remain open .",
    "for example , we studied codirected limit preservation by vietoris functors under different topological contexts ( see section [ sec_limits ] ) , showing cases in which they were preserved , and cases in which they were not .",
    "but we are still not precisely sure what is the ` weakest ' context in which they are preserved .",
    "another example concerns the existence of products in categories of vietoris coalgebras .",
    "recall also our study of topological functors between categories of coalgebras . among other things",
    ", it provides a full characterisation of situations in which it is possible to systematically lift well - known results about coalgebras over @xmath5 to coalgebras over other categories .",
    "we saw that this is indeed the case between coalgebras of polynomial functors over @xmath5 and their counterparts in @xmath4 , but we are also interested in other situations . two prime examples that we will explore in future work",
    "pertain coalgebras over the category @xmath109 and coalgebras over the category @xmath110 .",
    "these coalgebras have significant relevance within the coalgebraic community ( _ e.g. _  @xcite ) and we believe that our study can contribute to the topic .    on a note closer to practice",
    ", the use of topologies to specify and analyse ( non - deterministic ) hybrid systems brings a number of benefits , which were just barely grasped in this paper .",
    "our main goal is to further explore them in the near future .",
    "the plan is to do so in a coalgebraic component - based approach @xcite , where simple hybrid systems can be composed to form more complex ones . the results that this paper reports provide an interesting step in this direction .",
