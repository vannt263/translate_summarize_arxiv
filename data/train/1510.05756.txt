    "however , the background noise level limits the achievable minimum photon flux .",
    "this dilemma constrains the applications of the method , which directly takes the photon pair time intervals as @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the high order correction of the conversion to @xmath5 from the photon pair time intervals @xmath3 using the direct numerical convolution , and experimentally examined this method with a pseudo - thermal light source .",
    "a novel random phase modulation method is also demonstrated to measure the coherence time of a highly coherent source .",
    "it converts the source in the coherent sate to the chaotic state , in order to use the second order correlation function to characterize the ( first order correlation ) coherence time .",
    "meanwhile , to overcome the dilemma of photon flux , as mentioned above , this method shortens the coherence time to allow a higher photon flux above the background noise .    to measure the second order correlation function using the hbt interferometer , two related physical quantities : @xmath3 and @xmath6",
    "should be discussed as formulated in @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 , the experimentally measured result of the hbt , is the histogram of the consecutive photon pairs with a time interval @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath6 is the histogram of photons at time=@xmath4 with a photon at t=0 .",
    "the second order correlation function @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath6 , as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average photon detection rate per time bin of the light source and normalizes the histogram to the distribution of probability density .",
    "the time resolution ( the bin size of the histogram ) must be shorter than the coherence time of the light source under study . since @xmath6 should include the counts of the photon pair , which are not necessary to be consecutive , but just has a time interval @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath6 is an infinite convolution power series of @xmath3 @xcite , which is a histogram of the time intervals between two consecutive signal received from the `` start '' and the `` stop '' detectors ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : simple ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath9 @xmath10 is denoted as the self - convolution of @xmath3 in @xmath11 orders .",
    "the laplace transformed @xmath12 then can be derived from @xmath13 as : @xmath14 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the laplace transforms of @xmath6 and @xmath3 , respectively . using this equation to calculate @xmath5 requires an accurate and efficient numerical laplace transformation and its inversion , which is very sensitive and a challenging task for numerical analysis .",
    "therefore , it is not very often directly implemented in @xmath0 measurement experiments . in some of the experiments , it is to take @xmath15 as approximation by ignoring the high order terms , or to replace laplace transformation with fast - fourier - transformation ( fft )  @xcite . in the following sections",
    ", we examined a direct numerical convolution algorithm to derive @xmath5 from @xmath3 .",

    "a clock ( counter ) is triggered by the photon received from the `` start '' detector , then is stopped by the subsequent photon received from the `` stop '' detector .",

    "the order number of the self - convolution to reach a satisfactory accuracy depends on the convergency of the self - convolution power of @xmath3 .",
    "conducting a fourier transformation on eq .",
    "( [ eq : series ] ) can simplify the successive convolution of @xmath3 to the frequency domain @xmath16 : @xmath17 it is valid , if @xmath18 .",
    "a fast convergency will be given by a smaller @xmath16 , the rate of the convergency can be quantified by : @xmath19    for a chaotic thermal light source , we have @xmath20 then , for @xmath21 , the fourier transform of @xmath3 is : @xmath22 the convergency is predominated by the product @xmath23 , which is the power spectrum of the light source .",
    "a lorentzian chaotic light source model was used to further investigate the convergency of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath24 of a homogenous broadened light source can be modeled as @xcite : @xmath25 and , the power spectrum of such a light source is given as : @xmath26 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : k - f - ig ] ) , @xmath27 it shows that @xmath28 at the high frequency region , and the high order correction is only important in the low frequency region within the linewidth of the source , @xmath29",
    ". then , the convergency of the high order correction on calculating @xmath0 is dominated by the factor : @xmath30 the convergency of the power series @xmath31 is related to the product of the average photon detection rate and the coherence time : @xmath1",
    ". a smaller @xmath1 can result in a faster convergency .",
    "the product @xmath1 can be used to characterize the degree of the overlapping of photon wave packets . for a stronger overlapping ,",
    "the high order self - convolution will play a more important role .",
    "thus , while the direct summation of finite high orders is utilized to calculate @xmath0 , a lower photon flux @xmath8 or a short coherence time @xmath32 needs to be satisfied for an accurate result .    the error of @xmath6 , due to only finite high order terms included in the numerical calculation , can be estimated as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the highest order included in the finite power series . for a weak light source @xmath35 ,",
    "the error is @xmath36 and the convergency is with a power of @xmath34 . on the contrary , for the strong light sources with @xmath37 ,",
    "the error is approximated as @xmath38 , which goes down linearly with @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , it is important to have a sufficiently weak photon overlapping @xmath39 for a fast convergency .    for a source with a long coherence time @xmath2 , a very low photon flux rate @xmath8 is required by an accurate calculation of the correlation function . however , although the photon flux of the source under the measurement can be reduced simply using an attenuator , the minimum photon rate is limited by the stray light or the dark counts of the electronic .",
    "the photon flux of the source must be significantly higher than the background noise to reach a reliable measurement .",
    "therefore , a dilemma is imposed on the measurement of @xmath0 of the light source with a long coherence time . in our following experiment ,",
    "the rotating disk modulation method was demonstrated to overcome this obstacle .",
    "the coherence time of a long photon , a single frequency ne - he laser , was measured .",
    "as our discussion above , it seems that the more high order correction are included , the accuracy of the @xmath0 will be higher . in this section , we argue that the uncertainty of the beam splitter ratio will limit the highest order that can be included in the calculation .    to use the direct numerical convolution method , because of the partial reflection beam splitter , the splitting ratio correction factor must be taken into account .",
    "the experimentally measured time interval is not truly of two consecutive photons . in hbt measurement , after the `` start '' detector receiving a photon , the consecutive photon may go to the `` start '' detector , rather than the `` stop '' detector , with a probability of 1/2 for a 50:50 beam splitter . in such a case , there will be no signal generated from this event .",
    "thus , the time interval histogram of the consecutive photon pairs @xmath3 should be related to the experimentally measured photon pair time interval distribution @xmath40 as : @xmath41 the @xmath34th order self - convolution @xmath42s are expressed as : @xmath43    thus , @xmath6 can be calculated from the self - convolution power series of the experimentally measured time interval distribution @xmath40 with an additional factor 2 , while a 50:50 beam splitter was used .",
    "@xmath44    however , practically , a non - equal splitting ratio should be considered .",
    "a deviation @xmath45 , which could be caused by the imbalanced beam splitting ratio or the difference between the efficiencies of the detectors , leads to a correction of the 50% detection probability ratio as @xmath46 .",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath40 is then written as : @xmath47 the uncertainty of the splitting ratio @xmath45 will affect the accuracy of the resulted @xmath0 .",
    "the higher order self - convolution terms will be more severely affected .",
    "that is , such uncertainties will be amplified in the high order terms and limits the final achievable accuracy .",
    "a deviation @xmath45=5% in the splitting ratio , will result in a 30% error for the 5th order , and 100% for the 10th order .",
    "the experimental difficulty in measuring an accurate splitting ratio limits the maximum applicable order in calculating the final second order correlation function .",
    "the experimental set - up . to generate a pseudo - thermal light source , a single longitudinal mode 632  nm he - ne laser , passing through two polarizers for controlling the incident power ,",
    "is focused on a rotating wheel with a surface of sandpaper .",

    "the second order correlation function of the pseudo - thermal light was then calculated from the histogram of the recoded time intervals . ]",
    "the improvement and the accuracy of the direct numerical convolution method for analyzing @xmath48 was tested using a hbt photon interferometer to measure a pseudo - thermal light source with a variable coherence time . meanwhile , to measure a very long coherence time ( a narrow linewidth ) , we demonstrate a novel method , which is based on this experimental setup and needs no km - long optical fiber for self - heterodyne detection @xcite .    as shown in fig.[figure : setup ] , the hbt interferometer is based on a fiber - splitter ( 50:50 , throlabs 780-hp ) with single photon counting modules ( spcm , hamamatsu h7421 - 40 ) as the `` start '' and the `` stop '' detectors to measure the photon pair time intervals using an universal counter ( agilent 53131a ) .",
    "the pseudo - thermal light is the back scattering of the single frequency 632  nm he - ne laser from a rotating sand disk wheel .",
    "no frequency or power stabilization was utilized onto the he - ne laser .",
    "it is particularly suitable to simulate a light source with a very low intensity and a very long coherence time @xcite .",
    "the coherence time of the pseudo - thermal light was controlled by the rotating speed @xmath49 of the sand paper ( as @xmath50 ) to allow us to compare the deduced coherence time with the theoretical predication .",
    "the he - ne laser power was controlled by rotating two polarizers , then focused on the rotating sand disk using a convex lens . for a good stability and precision of the rotating speed of the sand disk ,",
    "the rotating wheel was modified from a light chopper wheel , whose rotating speed was locked to an oscillator clock .",
    "reducing the stray room light is important for measuring a long coherence time . as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq : c - factor ] ) , the product of the average photon detection rate and the coherence time @xmath51 should be smaller than 1 for an accurate measurement .",
    "that is , the longer coherence time requires a lower photon rate . on the other hand , the detected photon counts of the light source should be much higher than the background photon counts .",

    "a smaller bin size has also been used for our test run and showed no improvement on the result , but just cost more calculation time .",

    "figure [ fig : contribution ] shows the @xmath6s with various high order corrections .",
    "we found that a six - order convolution is sufficient to converge and to reach an accurate @xmath6 . taking the distribution of the photon pair intervals as @xmath0 or underestimating the high order correction will result in a prolonged coherence time .",
    "it also shows that the convergency is faster at the region of small @xmath4 as discussed in the section [ sec : high - order ] . on the contrary",
    ", the tail of @xmath6 with a large @xmath4 , which does not affect the resulted coherence time @xmath2 , has a slower convergency .",
    "we suggest the proper criterion of the highest order @xmath11 included in the calculation to be : @xmath58 in the region of @xmath59 , since the deviation of the resulted coherence time will be @xmath60 . in our experiment , @xmath61 is sufficient to meet the criterion .",
