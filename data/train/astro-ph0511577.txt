    "telluride ( cdte ) and cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) detectors are having a major impact on the field of hard x - ray astronomy .",
    "the swift@xcite satellite carries the burst alert telescope ( bat ) that uses czt detectors . the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral)@xcite includes the imager on board the integral satellite ( ibis ) which is built with cdte detectors .",
    "nasa s beyond einstein roadmap included two x - ray missions , constellation - x@xcite and the black hole finder probe ( bhfp ) .",
    "czt detectors will play an important role for both missions .",
    "the energetic x - ray imaging survey telescope ( exist)@xcite is a strong candidate for the bhfp and uses pixelated si and 0.5 cm thick czt detectors and the coded mask approach to cover the energy range from 5 kev to 600 kev . the non - thermal energy exploration telescope ( next)@xcite@xcite mission proposed in japan is a successor to the suzaku mission and will utilize cdte on two of its instruments . the hard x - ray imager ( hxi ) on board next will cover the energy range from 8 to 80 kev using a si ccd combined with a pixelated cdte detector .",
    "next will also carry the soft - gamma detector ( sgd ) , which uses cdte for an extended energy range up to 1 mev .",
    "the broad energy ranges of these missions requires either thick detectors or layers of thin detectors . in this presentation",
    ", we focus on 5 mm - thick cdte detectors .",
    "while cdte detectors show at room temperature a poorer performance than czt detectors , cdte might be an alternative to czt in spaceborne applications where temperatures around -20@xmath2c can be achieved without the need for cryogenic cooling .",
    "several groups tested relatively thin cdte detectors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we report here on results from evaluating 0.5 cm thick cdte detectors . using substrates from the company acrorad @xcite , we deposited different cathode and anode contacts and measured the i - v characteristics , the energy resolutions , and the electron mobility .",
    "we purchased two uncontacted 2@xmath02@xmath00.5 @xmath1 cdte substrates from acrorad . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the two detectors as d1 and d2 .",
    "the substrates were cleaned in di water and methanol .",
    "prior to contact deposition , the detectors were polished with three grades of abrasive paper followed by 0.3 and 0.05 @xmath6 m alumina suspension .",
    "optionally , the detectors were etched for 2 minutes in a solution of 5% br in 95% methanol .",
    "we deposited planar cathode contacts and @xmath7 anode pixels on the cdte substrates with an electron beam evaporator .",
    "the 1.6 mm diameter pixels with 2.4 mm pixel pitch were deposited using a 0.3  mm brass foil shadow mask .",
    "the first detectors showed modest performances .",
    "we thus started to use a method similar to the one described by takahashi et al .",

    "the heating was performed in a 10@xmath8 torr vacuum with the anode side facing an hg lamp , and a temperature sensor being attached to the backside of the detector . as discussed further below ,",
    "the heat treatment markedly improved the energy resolution achieved with the detectors .",
    "we used the high - workfunction metals au and pt as cathode materials and the low - workfunction metal in as anode material .",
    "the high - workfunction au and pt metals are expected to form ohmic contacts on the p - type cdte and the low - workfunction contacts blocking contacts .",
    "the heat treatment is thought to remove the te - rich surface layer and to improve the contact properties of the cdte  in junctions @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the two detectors as d1a - d1b and d2a - d2c , depending on which surface treatments and contact materials were used ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we measured the pixel - cathode dark current as a function of the cathode bias voltage for detector temperatures between @xmath9c and 20@xmath2c . holding all pixels at ground potential ,",
    "the currents were measured for three central pixels .    after keeping the detectors biased at a certain voltage for some time",
    ", we observed the well known breakdown phenomenon : a dramatic increase of the dark current .",
    "we found that if the bias voltage was set to zero after a breakdown and then immediately returned to its previous value , the breakdown would occur after a shorter period of time .",
    "however , if the bias voltage remained at zero for several minutes and was then returned to its previous value , the breakdown time would be very similar to its original value .",
    "figure 1 shows the current for the detector d1a at different temperatures and different bias voltages .",
    "it is evident that the time before breakdown decreases with increasing detector temperature and with more negative cathode bias voltages .",
    "figure 2 shows a very similar breakdown behaviour for the same crystal , this time depositing the in pixels after polishing , etching , and heat treatment ( detector d1b ) . as discussed further below",
    ", our heat treatment may have used temperatures too low to strongly suppress the breakdown behaviour .",

    "figure 3 shows the dark current for the detector d1a as a function of bias voltage for various temperatures .",

    "it can be recognized that the i - v characteristics are non - linear .",

    "the same three pixels for which the i - v measurements were performed were also used for measuring the energy spectra .",
    "a cathode bias voltage of -500 v was applied ; at @xmath9c this voltage allowed us to operate the detectors without incurring breakdown .",
    "the pixels were held at ground and ac coupled to a fast amptek 250 amplifier followed by a second - stage amplifier .",
    "the signals were sampled with a 500 mhz oscilloscope and the digitized pulses were send to a computer via ethernet .",
    "high - frequency filtering was done offline .",
    "the amplifier noise was 5 kev at -40@xmath2c and was subtracted in quadrature from the measured resolutions . in most cases , the amplifier noise was negligible compared to the inherent detector resolution .",

    "this depth of interaction ( doi ) effect can be corrected by comparing the anode and cathode signals for each pulse .",

    "photopeak events are highlighted in blue .",
    "the original and corrected 122 kev and 662 kev energy spectra for a detector d1b pixel are displayed in figs .",
    "after correction we obtain 122 kev and 662 kev full width half maximum ( fwhm ) energy resolutions of 8 kev ( 6.4% ) and 23 kev ( 3.4% ) , respectively .",

    "the cathodes were always deposited on the surfaces as polished .",
    "the energy resolution does depend on the surface treatment and the choice of contact materials .",

    "it is evident that the combination of etching and heat treatment prior to contact deposition improves the performance for both detectors . while the detector d2 did not produce a spectrum with any photopeak prior to etching and heating",
    ", it did show a photopeak afterward , although the 662 kev energy resolution ( 55 kev , 8.3% ) was still very modest .",

    "we have shown that changes in the surface preparation yield widely different detector performances .",
    "our detectors showed a breakdown if biased for a sufficient time ; the time before breakdown was longer for lower bias voltages and at colder detector temperatures .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that a combination of low bias voltage and low temperature may suppress the breakdown completely .",
    "other authors have experimented with between 0.5 and 2.0 mm thick cdte detectors .",
