    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) are a family of more than 40 layered materials with general formula mx@xmath0 , where m is a transition metal , and x is a chalcogen ( i.e. a group vi element such as sulfur or selenium )  @xcite .",

    "despite many fundamental studies of the structure and properties of tmds in the 1960s and 70s  @xcite , including reports of monolayer  @xcite and few - layer crystals  @xcite , the lack of suitable processing and characterization techniques for such materials meant that their unique optical characteristics were not exploited for practical technologies . at present , semiconducting tmds ( mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 , mote@xmath0 etc . )",
    "are experiencing renewed interest due to their remarkable layer - dependent optoelectronic properties , which hold great promise for future photonic devices@xcite .",
    "these include a transition from an indirect to direct bandgap at visible / near - infrared wavelengths when moving from bulk to monolayer form , in addition to strong photoluminescence , high nonlinearity and ultrafast carrier dynamics for mono- and few - layer forms  @xcite .",
    "the direct bandgaps of monolayer semiconducting tmds in the visible and near - infrared offer advantages over graphene , a zero - gap material , for many optoelectronic applications . additionally , the layer- and size - dependent characteristics of these tmds allow great flexibility for engineering their optical properties  @xcite .",
    "molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) is perhaps the most widely studied tmd to date  @xcite .",
    "recent work has demonstrated wideband saturable absorption in few - layer mos@xmath0  @xcite , suggesting that semiconducting tmds could be a promising class of saturable absorber ( sa ) for short laser pulse generation  @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have exploited this sa response , demonstrating mode - locked and q - switched lasers ( with both bulk and fiber gain media ) from 1030 to 2100 nm  @xcite either at discrete wavelengths or with broadband tunability  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the ability of a single mos@xmath0 sa device to operate at numerous wavelengths , even in spectral regions corresponding to sub - bandgap photon energies , is due to edge - state absorption in the material  @xcite .",

    "selenide_-based tmds ( mose@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 , etc . ) have yet to be fully explored and could offer advantages over sulfide tmds for certain applications , for instance where a narrower gap semiconductor is required ( heavier chalcogenide atoms lead to reduced bandgap energies  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , further investigation to understand the optical properties of few - layer transition metal selenides is required before they can be exploited in practical systems .",
    "few - layer molybdenum diselenide ( mose@xmath0 ) flakes have been fabricated by mechanical exfoliation  @xcite , ultrasound - assisted liquid - phase exfoliation ( ualpe )  @xcite and chemical vapor deposition ( cvd )  @xcite techniques .",

    "low boiling point solvents , e.g. water , are thus more desirable to exfoliate mose@xmath0 , although large mismatch of hansen solubility parameters of water  @xcite with mose@xmath0 ( and other layered materials )  @xcite dictates the use of surfactants for its exfoliation and stabilization in water .    for layered materials ,",
    "the molecular structure of surfactants plays an important role .",
    "the most effective are quasi-2d surfactants such as bile salts ( e.g. sodium cholate ) due to their planar structure with a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side .",
    "the hydrophobic side of the bile salt surfactant molecules adsorbs onto the flat surface of the layered materials , while the hydrophilic side creates an effective surface charge around the flake  @xcite .",
