    "the constraints of a monoidal category are too strong for some applications in physics .",

    "for example in joyce @xcite recouplings embodying the pauli exclusion principle are natural isomorphisms that do not satisfy the pentagon diagram for representations of the group @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "this provides motivation for investigating weakened monoidal structures .",
    "a partial exploration of the problem is given in joyce @xcite and does not consider braids , nor violations of the triangle diagram . an alternative approach using @xmath2categories is given by yanofsky @xcite    given a category @xmath3 with a bifunctor @xmath4 one may form `` words '' by iterating the bifunctor .",
    "thus one may ask what is the relationship between different words .",
    "we initially investigate structures with only a natural isomorphism @xmath5 for associativity .",
    "any extra conditions such as the usual pentagonal constraint of a monoidal category is a luxury and not necessarily a fundamental requirement .",
    "this minimum structure we call a premonoidal structure .",
    "we introduce the groupoid of coupling trees which characterises this structure functorially .",
    "further we consider weaker constraints than the pentagonal constraint and prove suitable coherence theorems .",
    "ultimately we arrive at the mac lane coherence theorem @xcite without a unit .",
    "next we consider two extensions of these structures .",
    "first to a category with a unit structure where the triangle diagram is not necessarily required to hold .",
    "the relevant groupoid is of coupling trees with nodules .",

    "a premonoidal structure is not necessarily monoidal because the pentagonal constraint does not hold and there is no account taken of a unit . despite the lack of a pentagonal constraint we can nevertheless measure the degree to which the pentagonal constraint is deformed as defined in the next definition .",
