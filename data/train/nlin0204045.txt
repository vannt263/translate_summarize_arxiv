    "the study of the cellular automata(ca ) has been one of the most important fields for the understanding of the complex systems . and",
    "many efforts have been carried out for the understanding of it .",
    "various patterns had been generated by choosing the transition rules , and the patterns have been classified by wolfram roughly into four classes@xcite .",
    "langton has introduced parameter @xmath0 and showed that as @xmath0 is increased the pattern changes from class i(homogeneous),class ii(periodic ) to class iii(chaotic ) . and at some cases , the class iv(edge of chaos ) is realized between the two@xcite .",
    "+ the @xmath0 parameter could classify the qualitative behavior of the ca , but it is not enough@xcite .",
    "it is well known that at the same @xmath0 the time evolution of the configuration shows periodic pattern(class ii ) , chaotic one(class iii ) or edge of the chaos pattern(class iv ) depending on the initial seed of the random number generator .",
    "the reason or mechanism for it has not been known yet ; we have no way to control the pattern classes at fixed @xmath0 . and the transition of periodic to chaotic pattern",
    "is taken place at rather wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is a natural anticipation that more parameters are necessary to get the quantitative understanding of the pattern classes of the ca . in this article",
    "we report another parameter which classifies the pattern classes more quantitatively . if the capacity to support computation is realized at the edge of the chaos@xcite , we have acquired a method to reach there more effectively .    in the section 2",
    ", we will briefly summarize our notations and explain the key discovery which leads us to the understanding of the structure of the rule table .",
    "it strongly indicates that the rules which destroy the schema of the quiescent state play an important role to distinguish the pattern classes .    in the section 3 , guided by the discovery of the section 2 , we classify the rule table according to the destruction and construction of the schema of the quiescent states .",
    "the rule which destroys the longest schema of the quiescent state plays strongest effects for the patterns .",
    "then we introduce a new parameter force for each rules which destroy the schema . with this parameter",
    ", we determine the phase diagram in the @xmath0 and the force plane .",
    "it clearly explains why at fixed @xmath0 the different patterns are generated and we could control the pattern classes more quantitatively .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussions and the conclusions , where effects of the structure of the rule table will further be discussed .",
    "in order to make the argument concrete , in this article we focus on the one dimensional cellular automata with 5-neighbors and 4-states .",
    "but the qualitative results are independent of the details of the models .",
    "this point will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "we follow the definitions of langton@xcite but for the self consistentness we will briefly summarize them .    in our study",
    ", the sites consist of 150 cells with the periodic boundary condition , which are denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 represents the time step which take integer value , and the @xmath4 is the position of site which range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath2 takes the value @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the state @xmath5 is taken to be quiescent state@xcite .",
    "the set of the states @xmath2 at fixed @xmath3 is called the configuration at time @xmath3 .    the configuration at time @xmath9 is determined by that of time @xmath3 by the following local relation ,    @xmath10    the set of the mappings @xmath11 is called rule table .",
    "the rule table consists of @xmath12 mappings , which are selected from the totally @xmath13 elements .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is defined as follows@xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number that @xmath16 in eq.[r_table ] is not equal to @xmath5 . in other word",
    "the @xmath0 is a probability that the rules do not select the quiescent state in next time step . in the following we set the rule tables randomly according to the probability @xmath0@xcite , and",
    "the initial configurations are also set randomly .",
    "the time history of the configurations is called pattern .",
    "the patterns are classified by wolfram@xcite roughly into four classes .",
    "it has been known that as the @xmath0 increases the most frequently generated patterns change from homogeneous(class i ) , periodic(class ii ) to chaotic(class iii ) and at the region between class ii and class iii , the edge of chaos is located(class iv ) .      in order to find the reason why the different patterns are generated at the same @xmath0",
    ", we had started to collect a lot of rule tables with different pattern classes . and",
    "by studying them , we had tried to find the differences between rule tables .",
    "we had fixed @xmath18 , which correspond to @xmath17 .",
    "we had chosen this @xmath0 because at this point the chaotic , edge of chaos and periodic patterns are generated in the similar ratio . by changing the random number ,",
    "we have gathered a few tens of the rule tables and classified them into chaotic , edge of chaos and periodic ones .",
    "first we studied whether the pattern classes are sensitive to the initial configurations or not .",
    "we fixed the rule table and changed the initial configurations .",
    "the details of the patterns depend on the initial configurations but the pattern classes are not changed@xcite .",
    "then the difference of the pattern classes is due to that of the rule tables and our target is addressed to the study of them .",
    "after some trial and error , we have found the fact that for rule tables which generate the edge of the chaos and periodic patterns , the transition table @xmath19 was almost always equal to @xmath5 , while for that of the chaotic pattern , it was not equal to @xmath5 in majority of cases . for about 10 rule tables of each pattern classes , we get following results for the probability that the rule tables have @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 for periodic plus edge of chaos rule tables , + @xmath22 for chaotic rule tables .    in this article",
    ", we call the pattern as edge of chaos when its transient length@xcite is longer than @xmath23 time steps .",
    "these difference given by eq.[perio ] and eq.[chaos ] has lead us the following idea .",
    "let us think of the schemas of quiescent state @xmath5 with length longer than five . if the rule @xmath24 is included in the rule table , they are necessarily broken .",
    "then it pushes the pattern to that of chaos .",
    "if our idea is correct , we could artificially change the rule tables of the chaos to that of periodic by replacing @xmath25 to @xmath20 .",
    "we have tried the replacements for about 10 rule tables . in all cases",
    "we have succeeded to change the rule tables from chaotic to periodic or periodic to chaotic by a replacements of the @xmath19 .",
    "an example is shown in the figure [ pattern_change ] .",
    "the change in the pattern is dramatical but the differences in the rule table are only two , which has been quite exciting for us .",
    "this discovery was a key hint to lead us to the hypothesis that the rules which breaks the schema of the quiescent state will determine the pattern classes .",
    "in order to test the hypothesis of the previous section , we group the rule table into the four types according to the operation on the schema of quiescent state .    in the following , greek characters in the rule table represent @xmath7 and @xmath8 while roman ones @xmath26 and @xmath8 .",
    "type 1 : @xmath27 .",
    "+ the rules in this type destroy the schemas of quiescent state .",
    "type 2 : @xmath28 .",
    "+ the rules of this type conserve them . +",
    "type 3 : @xmath29 . + the rules of this type develop the schema . + type 4 : @xmath30 . + the rules in this type do not affect the schema in next time step .",
    "the sum of the number of the type 1 and type 2 rules is 256 , while that of type 3 and type 4 rules is 768 .",
    "how many numbers of each type of rules are included in the rule table is determined randomly according to the probability @xmath0 .",
    "the type 1 rules are further classified into five groups according to the length of the schema which breaks .",
    "they are shown in the table [ destruction ] .",
    "the classification of the rules in type 1 .",
    "[ destruction ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results in table [ relative_force ] are natural in the following sense",
    ". if six d4 rules are present for the rule table , then the presence of d5 has no effects , because the length 5 schema of quiescent state could not be made .",
    "they have roughly similar effects as one d5 rule , then the strength of the d4 will approximately be equal to @xmath31 of that of d5 .",
    "similarly the strength of the d3 and d2 will be about @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the results given in the table [ relative_force ] are not very different from these naive expectations .    with these results for the coefficients of eq.[force_sum ] , we determine the transition points by means of the force .",
    "we call it as critical force(@xmath34 ) .",
    "the results are shown in the fig.[phase_diagram ] . in the fig.[phase_diagram ] , we have added @xmath35 calculated from the naive expectations for the relative strengths . in this case too , errors are estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "the difference between them are not large .",
    "this figure distinguishes the pattern classes more quantitatively , and visualizes why at the fixed @xmath0 the three patterns chaos , edge of the chaos and periodic coexist .",
    "the impressive point is that the transition occurs about @xmath36 .",
    "this means that in many cases the replacements of d5 will change the pattern classes , which is consistent with the experiments at section 2 .",
    "we should like to notice that the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] is an average over about 60 to 85 sets of the critical combinations , which belong to different rule tables .",
    "@xmath37 difference of patterns with @xmath25 and @xmath20 + by carrying out the replacements rp4s and rp3s , we could artificially obtain the rule table of periodic pattern with @xmath25 . in this case",
    "the length of the schema of quiescent state could not develop longer than 4 , then the patterns will have thin stripes in the time direction .",
    "while for the patterns generated by the rule table without d5 , there is very small probability that the thin stripes are created . then there will be clear difference between the two patterns .",
    "an example is shown in the fig.[periopattern ] .",
    "the differences in patterns is again dramatical while those in rule table are only 2 .",
    "similarly for the patterns of an edge of the chaos , when the rule tables have d5 , the patterns are drawn on the background of the thin stripes as shown in the fig.[periopattern]a , while if they do not include d5 , patterns are drawn essentially on the quiescent states .",
    "the differences between these two patterns are impressive .",
    "similar situation is observed for the pattern when six d4s are included in the rule table . in this case , the maximum length of the schema of quiescent state is 3 , that the width of the stripe becomes more narrow .",
    "the existence of the rules of the table [ destruction ] has strong effects for the details of the patterns .",
    "@xmath37 fluctuation of rule tables around @xmath38 + when the rule tables are generated randomly , how many type 1 rules are included , is determined randomly by the probability @xmath0 .",
    "the largest fluctuation is realized for d5 , because it has only one element .",
    "next is d4 and so on . and the transition is taken place about @xmath39 to @xmath40 of the force expressed in the unit of @xmath41",
    ". then the change of the pattern classes are easily realized by the fluctuation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "this fact explains why the transition and edge of chaos is scattered rather wide range in @xmath0 .",
    "also the fluctuation is largest at @xmath44 .",
    "then the coexistence of the periodic pattern and chaotic pattern is most likely to be realized around this region .",
    "as the edge of chaos is located at the boundary of these two pattern classes , it is also realized most frequently around @xmath45 .",
    "especially when the number of the states in cell is equal to two .",
    "@xmath37 edge of chaos and order of transition + when the replacements of rp3 or rp2 are carried out , we find the edge of chaos(very long transient lengths ) in many cases . sometimes they are observed rather wide range in @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "this seems to indicate that in many cases , the transition is second order like .",
    "but the widths in the ranges of @xmath46 or @xmath47 are different from each other and there are cases where the widths are less than one unit in the replacement of d2 rules(first order like ) .",
    "what is the origin of the difference in the width is an open problem and may be studied by taking into account the effects of the type 3 rules .",
    "it is a very interesting problem under what condition , the transition becomes first order like or second order like .",
    "@xmath37 special cases of the rule table + the relative strength of the force given by the table [ relative_force ] could not be applied for some special cases .",
    "when the rule table contains all the 33 d3 rules , the schemas of the quiescent state with length 4 could not develop , then the presence of the d4 have no chance to work . in this case , the force from the d4 and d5 are equal to zero .",
    "the results given in the table [ relative_force ] do not include in these special cases .",
    "but these special rule tables are very hard to be realized as far as they are determined randomly .",
    "the results for the table [ relative_force ] are the average over the rule tables which are typically obtained randomly according to the probability @xmath0 .",
    "we have made a few replacements experiments at more extreme @xmath0 . at @xmath48 , in most cases , a randomly generated rule tables belong to chaotic pattern .",
    "we have succeeded to change them to the rule table of periodic pattern by the replacements of rp5 , rp4s and rp3s . on the other hand at @xmath49 ,",
    "most of the generated rule tables were periodic ones . in this case too , the replacements rc5 and a few rc4s make the rule table to that of chaotic pattern classes . then the conclusion that the number and combination of the type 1 rule determine the pattern classes is correct for more wider space of rule tables .",
    "however when @xmath0 exceed @xmath50 , the state @xmath5 lost its role as a quiescent state .",
    "then the analysis in this article will not be applied there .",
    "@xmath37 other one dimensional cellular automata + the similar study has been carried out for the one dimensional 3-neighbors and 16-states ca . in this case",
    "there are 3 groups of rules which destroy the schemas of quiescent state ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the results are very preliminary , but we have succeeded to change the chaotic patterns to periodic one by making only one set of replacements at @xmath55 . @xmath56 it needs some more studies to obtain the quantitative results .",
    "but the result that the rules which breaks the schemas of quiescent state play main role for the determination of the pattern classes and the qualitative phase diagram will be common for all ca including two dimensional ones .",
    "@xmath37 conclusions + the pattern in the ca is strongly affected by the type 1 rules , which are classified in the table [ destruction ] . around @xmath57 region ,",
    "the replacements of d5 and a few d4s change the pattern classes .",
    "the number of the replacements has been always less than @xmath58 if rp5 and rp4 or rc5 and rc4 are included .",
    "the type 1 rules have a hierarchy in their effect to push the rule table toward chaotic one as shown in eq .",
    "[ order_force ] .",
    "this property is studied more quantitatively by introducing force for the rules in table [ destruction ] .",
    "then we have obtained the phase diagram of ca .",
    "it is determined by many approximations and assumptions .",
    "but it tell us how to control the pattern classes at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the edge of the chaos of the ca is realized as the result of the delicate balance between the creation of the schemas of quiescent state by type 3 rules and the destruction of them by the type 1 rules . by making replacements defined by the eq.[toperio ] or eq .",
