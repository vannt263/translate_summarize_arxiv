    "in previous microlensing models the rates and optical depth per star are usually estimated ( kiraga and paczyski , 1994 han and gould , 1995 , mollerach and roulet , 1996 ) .",
    "below some limiting magnitude these stars can not be resolved individually and form a dense stellar background on all the surface of the images .",
    "i will call these star `` background stars '' .",
    "these background stars can be lensed , and this issue has already been investigated in the case of the lmc ( bouquet , 1993 ) , and for the galaxy ( nemiroff , 1994 ) . however",
    "the stellar fields of the current microlensing experiments macho ( alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , ogle ( udalski _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , duo ( alard 1995a , alard _ et al . _",
    "1995b ) , eros ( aubourg _ et al .",
    "are extremly crowded , so tha inside the resolution radius of a monitored stars , there are plenty of these unresolved background stars .",
    "thus if one of these background stars is lensed , we will see a blended event .",
    "the amplification , duration and impact parameter will be biased by the blending .",
    "we may now wonder if their contribution to the total number of events observed is significant , compared to those expected from the resolved stars .",
    "as the blending of a background star with a resolved star will be high we expect a large reduction of the effective einsten radius ( di stefano and esin , 1995 )",
    ". consequently the observed number of events will be a competition between the decrease of the einsten radius , and the increasing number of stars at larger magnitudes .",
    "also the effective duration of the event will be much shorter than it is for to events on resolved stars , and consequently it may produce a tail of short events .",
    "these short events could be confused with low mass lens events , and especially lensing by brown dwarf , so that a detailed study of these events is particulary important .",
    "another problem will be to recognise these blended events .",
    "the blending of light produces a modified light curve which might be distinguished from the unblended light curve .",
    "however to make an unambiguous separation a good time sampling is required , and a very accurate photometry is required . in the case of these short events , we expect that it will be difficult to achieve a sampling dense enough .",
    "the study of lensing of unresolved stars is very sensitive to the shape of the adopted luminosity function . in previous works ( kiraga and pazcyski , roulet and mollerach , han and gould ) ,",
    "the number of stars at a given luminosity @xmath0 is expressed as : @xmath1 , with usually @xmath2 .",
    "a more realistic luminosity function can be derived from the holtzman ( holtzman _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) observations of a field in baade window with the hst .",
    "the final holtzman _ et al .",
    "_ luminosity function can be approximated by three continuous straight segments with different slopes .",
    "the first change in the slope occur at @xmath3 . with the extinction and distance to the galactic center adopted by holtzman _",
    ", it correponds to a value of @xmath4 . .",
    "the holtzman _",
    "_ study agrees well with terndrup ( terndrup 1989 ) investigations of the galactic bulge which found a value of @xmath5 for the bulge turn - off at @xmath6 . in the holtzman luminosity function",
    "the turn - off is situated around @xmath7 also .",
    "the second change in the slope occur around @xmath8 and seeems to continue until the holtzman _",
    "limit situated at @xmath9 . a comparison with the luminosity function of the globular clusters reviewed by mould ( mould 1996 ) indicates that the shape of their luminosity function is almost the same in this range of magnitude .",
    "the mould diagram allows also to a better determination of the last segment of the luminosity function .",
    "this straight segment seems to hold until @xmath10 where a possible turnover in the luminosity function is observed .",
    "however @xmath10 is about 7 magnitudes fainter than the limiting magnitude of the current microlensing surveys , and such faint unresolved stars do not contribute to the optical depth .",
    "the duration of the events on stars blended with a star 7 magnitudes brighter would be so short that it is not observable .",
    "consequently the exact behavior of the luminosity function in this region is not important for our study , and we will make the reasonable choice to cut the luminosity function at @xmath10 .",
    "looking now at the bright side of the luminosity function , we find that at magnitudes brighter than the turnoff , the slope is very steep indicating that the number of stars drops rapidly . in this region",
    "the bulge stars are essentially sub giants .",
    "the density rises again in the clump giant region , however these stars do not makes more than 5 percent of the stars in the current surveys .",
    "consequently they have not a very significant influence on the total luminosity function .",
    "these stars should be treated separately ( alard 1996 ) , and in the present study , we will ignore them .",
    "this will put the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath11 in the holtzman _",
    "the adopted value for the distance to the galactic center in this study is 8.5 kpc .",
    "the final adopted luminosity function is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is clear that , in an investigation of the lensing of unresolved stars , consistency requires that we calculate the rates and optical depth also with the same luminosity function .",
    "this involves some slight changes from previous analysis .",
    "therefore i will first investigate the case of resolved stars considering a more general form for the luminosity function .",
    "i first calculate the change in the optical depth .      the numbers of source stars at distance @xmath12 , and with absolute luminosity l can be written as : @xmath13 where k is a constant .",
    "+ suppose that the experiment is able to find a total of @xmath14 stars up to a limit in apparent luminosity @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to the following expressions : @xmath16 with : @xmath17 and : @xmath18 , where @xmath15 is the apparent limiting luminosity .",
    "+ @xmath19 . where @xmath20 is defined as the saturation limit of the detector .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the detector dynamic range , a reasonable value is about 6 magnitudes in crowded fields , either for ccd or photographic plates .    the optical depth associated with these stars can be calculated as ( paczyski 1991 , kiraga and paczyski 1994 , hereafter refered as kp ) : @xmath23 with : @xmath24 and @xmath25 + to get the total optical depth we have now to integrate eq ( 1 ) over the source distances @xmath12 and the absolute luminosity @xmath0 of these stars .",
    "+ @xmath26 with : @xmath27 and : @xmath28 here the factor @xmath29 is put in this expression to allow direct comparison with the standard optical depth formulae ( kiraga and paczyski 1994 ) : @xmath30 we see that the kiraga and paczyski expression is simply equivalant to taking @xmath31 at all distances .",
    "a slight improvement is to take @xmath32 beyond a given distance ( roulet and mollerach , 1995 ) .",
    "the plot in figure 2 allows a direct comparison between @xmath33 , and the approximation @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the calculations both for duo and for the ogle experiment , which is about one magnitude deeper .",
    "let s see now the changes in the total optical depth introduced by the @xmath33 function .",
    "the optical depths are computed using the cobe bar model for the bulge ( dwek _ et al .",
    "_ , .. ) , and the bahcall model for the disk ( bahcall and soneira , 1984 ) the ratio of the modified optical depth to the standard one is shown in table 1 .",
    "the change is already important for ogle , and is more significant again for duo .",
    "it is easy to understand that the lower optical depth of the new formulae is essentially due to the fact that due to the limiting magnitude , the experiments are more sensitive to sources in the near end of the bar , for which the density of lenses on the line of sight is smaller .",

    "+   + this leads to : @xmath39 the result of the calculation of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 rates is shown in figure 3 for duo , and in figure 4 for ogle .",
    "for all the figures the velocity dispersion given by han and gould ( han and gould 1995 ) was adopted .",
    "the mass function is a salpeter mass function with a lower cut off at @xmath42 and an upper cut off at @xmath43 .",
    "the einsten radius is defined as the distance for which the amplification of a microlensing event is a factor of 1.34 . in the case of an unresolved background star of luminosity @xmath15 , blended with a resolved star of magnitude @xmath44 ,",
    "the background star amplification required to make a total amplification in the combined image of 1.34 is : @xmath45 hereafter , i will refer to @xmath46 as the blending factor : @xmath47 this gives the following expression for the blended einsten radius : @xmath48 with : @xmath49^{1/2}\\ ] ]      let us consider unresolved background stars with absolute luminosity l at a distance @xmath12 , whose number is dn(@xmath12,l ) , and let us suppose also that they are blended with stars of apparent luminosity @xmath50 .",
    "the optical depth per resolved star associated with these stars can be calculated using equation ( 2 ) by replacing the einsten radius by the blended einsten radius . @xmath51",
    "the expression for @xmath52 contains the factor @xmath53 , which takes into account that only those unresolved objects which are lensed close to a resolved star will be seen .",
    "the value of @xmath53 will be close to the ratio of the area of the seeing disk , to the mean space occupied by a star on the image . + with : + @xmath54 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath55 .",
    "+   + we have now to take into account that the luminosity @xmath50 of the resolved star is not constant , but comes from the luminosity function .",
    "it was shown by zhao ( zhao 1995 ) using the ogle data that the number of resolved stars in baadeswindow can be well described by a power law , with an exponent close to @xmath56 . to be precise",
    "we have a fraction of stars near luminosity @xmath50 : @xmath57 with : @xmath58 and @xmath59 + consequently , @xmath60    to get the total optical depth associated with the unresolved stars , we have now to integrate over the luminosity range of these stars , from the absolute luminosity ( @xmath61 ) to the faint end of their luminosity function ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "in addition , we have also to integrate over all the possible distances for the sources , and all apparent luminosities for the blends .",
    "+   + this leads to : @xmath63 @xmath64 + if now we uses eqs , ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , we can express @xmath65 as : +   + @xmath66 @xmath67 this expression can be integrated over the variables @xmath0 and @xmath50 , consquently : @xmath68 with : @xmath69 @xmath70 note that the dependance in distance is hidden in the variable @xmath71 , and also in the boundary @xmath61 .",
    "+   + figure 5 illustrates the new @xmath72 function for the unresolved stars in the case of the duo and ogle experiments . note that these functiond reach their maxima at larger distances than the previous @xmath33 functions , it means that a large contribution will come from unresolved sources on the far side of the bar .",
    "it is now possible to quantify the contribution of the unresolved sources to the total optical depth . in table 2",
    "the ratio of the optical depth of unresolved sources to the the optical depth of resolved sources is indicated for duo and ogle .",
    "the calculation of this ratio require an estimation of the r constant .",
    "a crude estimate of r is the ratio of the surface covered by the resolution radius to the mean area occupied by a star . for the duo experiment",
    "the resolution radius is close to 3 pixels , and the mean area occupied by a star is about 60 pixels ( alard and guibert 1996 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath73 .",
    "for ogle the resolution radius is probably close to the seeing value ( this is due to smaller pixels ) .",
    "consequently with a mean seeing of @xmath74 in las campanas , and a pixel of @xmath75 we can estimate the resolution radius as 2.7 pixels .",
    "the ogle experiment follows @xmath76 stars on 14 images of @xmath77 pixels each .",
    "this gives again a value for r , of @xmath73 .",
    "llll @xmath78 & bulge lenses & disk lenses & total + ogle & 0.58 & 0.55 & 0.57 + duo & 1.93 & 1.81 & 1.89 +      the rates per resolved star for unresolved events can be calculated in the same way as for the optical depth .",
    "+ we have : @xmath79 with : @xmath80 @xmath70 it is clear that the change of the einsten radius by the factor @xmath81 changes also the duration by the same factor .",
    "consequently in the differential rates calculation , each duration @xmath82 will have to be scaled by the factor @xmath81 .",
    "however , we see in equation 4 that for a given einsten radius there is a distribution of the scaling factors @xmath81 hidden in the double integral @xmath83 . this distribution can be calculated for each distance @xmath12 , and for the realisation of the calculations , the scaling factor of the einsten radius will be choosen by a monte - carlo method using this distribution .",
    "some examples of such distributions for different distances are shown in figure 6 , in the case of the duo experiment .",
    "+   +    the result of the calculation of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 rates is shown in figure 7 for duo , and in figure 8 for ogle .",
    "it is evident that the duo experiment is dominated by unresolved stars .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with the data ( alard and guibert 1996 ) . even for ogle which has the deepest photometry ,",
    "the bias is still very significant .",
    "it is rather straightforward to relate these events to the excess in the rates and optical depth observed towards the bulge .",
    "this excess was not been explained , even using a bar in the galactic model .",
    "we find here a natural explaination .",
    "the light curve of a blended event is affected by the additional light coming from the companion , so that the light curve is modified .",
    "this blended light curve has more extended wings than an unblended event , so that it might be possible to differentiate it from the unblended one using a chi - square test . +",
    "another important issue is the possibilty that the amplified star and its companion may have different colors .",
    "for instance if the companion is more blue than the amplified star , we expect more blending in the blue , and thus a larger reduction of the amplitude in this color than in the red .",
    "let us now investigate the problem of color variation during the event in more detail .",
    "in the current microlensening experiments the sources are concentated in the range @xmath84 .",
    "an examination of terndrup ( terndrup , 1988 ) color magnitude diagram in baadeswindow indicates that the mean @xmath85 color is about 1.3 to 1.4 . for fainter stars , where expect to find the unresolved sources , the holtzman _",
    "_ color magnitude diagram shows that the color changes again very slightly . the mean color a close to 1.4 at @xmath86 .",
    "we see that in the apparent magnitude range of interest we expect a diferential color variation of about 0.1 magnitude at most between the unresolved source and the blending companion .",
    "we have to reach @xmath87 to expect more significant color variation between sources and blend ( about 0.2 magnitudes ) .",
    "unfortunately the photographic technique does not perform very well in the red band , thus an accurate investigation of the color changes during the event is not possible .",
    "it means that the duo survey will not be able to detect the slight color changes expected .",
    "the ogle survey has a good coverage only in the i band , the sampling in v is very sparse , and does not allow color analysis during the event . in the macho case ,",
    "photometric data are available in two large bandpasses , which is transformed to a @xmath88 color index .",
    "the analysis of the lmc events by macho shows that they can identify color variations due to blending for some of the events .",
    "however there is a small residual noise on the color variations of all the events of about 0.02 to 0.03 magnitudes , associated with the photometric errors . at a 3 @xmath89 confidence level",
    "we may require a color variation of about @xmath90 magnitude to firmly established the chromaticity of the event .",
    "converted to @xmath85 it requires a color changes of about 0.15 magnitudes at least to recognise a blended event with a good confidence level .",
    "+ we consider now with a such accuracy how many of the bulge microlensing events which involves unresolved sourves could be identified as such .",
    "+   + let us make the following simple model : +   + and we assume that the difference of color can be described by a gaussian distribution , shifted by a systematic value .",
    "thus the number density @xmath91 of stars with color a difference in color c will be expressed as : @xmath92 the holtzman _",
    "_ color magnitude diagram indicates that for the gaussian we can assume @xmath93 . in the range @xmath94 to @xmath86 , a conservative value for the shift is @xmath95 .",
    "the color shift is then given by : @xmath96 i and v stand where the subscripts for the two photometric colors . with : @xmath97 and : @xmath98 + a and c are defined by the following expressions : +   + @xmath99 the number of events with color blending signature identified will be simply the number of events with a color shift @xmath100 .",
    "it can be easily calculated if we assume that the unblended impact parameter @xmath101 has a uniform distribution . in this case",
    "it is sufficient to integrate the number of events with @xmath100 over the @xmath101 distribution with a given color difference @xmath102 .",
    "the calculation is completed by suming over the color difference distribution defined in eq ( 5).the maximum value of the impact parameter is set by the blending factor @xmath103 using the formulae : @xmath104^{1/2}\\ ] ] with : @xmath45 the calculation of the percentage of events with color shifts is performed for several values of the blending factor @xmath46 .",
    "an illustration of these calculations is given in figure 9 , where the color shift is expressed as a function of the impact parameter for a few @xmath46 values , and color diffrence of 0.2 magnitude .",
    "looking at this diagram we can already guess that the number of events with detectable color shitfts will be small .",
    "the final values of the events with color shifts identified is given in table 3 .",
    "the values are extremly small . a shift of 0.15 mags in the color difference distribution , even for high values of the blending factor .",
    "the values for a shift of 0.3 magnitudes are also given , to illustrate the case of the very faint unresolved stars .",
    "however these stars will be extremly blended , and consequently will give events will very short duration which will be almost all removed by the low efficiency of the experiments in this range .",
    "consequently the color shift method will give poor results in the case of the galactic bulge .",
    "in the case of the magellanic clouds , the color changes rapidly with the magnitude close to the limit of the microlensing experiments , which explains why so many events with color shifts are found by macho ( alcock , _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996)towards the lmc .",
    "lllll blending factor & 2 & 5 & 10 & 50 + @xmath105 &",
    "0.0025 & 0.0219 & 0.0364 & 0.0485 + @xmath106 & 0.1677 & 0.3079 & 0.3559 & 0.3906 +      i will investigate another possibility to identify a blended microlensing event based on the shape of the light curve in this section .",
    "the blending of light modifies the shape of the light curve , and consequently we may use a statistical test to see if a light curves differs significantly from an unblended one .",
    "however we have to realise that the likely difference due to blending is rather small , and we may expect that with the current available photometry it will be difficult to identify a blended light curve at a significant level of confidence .",
    "it is possible to adress this problem in more general terms using monte - carlo simulation of microlensing events . assuming a noise distribution",
    ", it is easy to simulate microlensing events with different blending factors .",
    "these blended events can be analysed by fitting an unblended curve to the simulated data set .",
    "we expect a systematic difference in the chi - square of the fir due to the different shape of the blended light curve , especially in the wings .",
    "however the problem is to know how significant is this difference compared to the normal chi - square variations for unblended events due to noise .",
    "this problem can be easily addressed if we are able to build the chi - square distribution for a series of blended light curves .",
    "such chi - square distributions are illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , the line shows the limit within which 95 percent of the chi - square distribution for unblended events is contained . beyond this limit",
    "we have a 95 percent confidence level that the chi - square indicates a light curve which is systematically different from the unblended model .",
    "it is now sufficient to sum the fraction of the blended distribution beyond this limit to get the fraction of blended events @xmath107 which can be identified with a good confidence level .",
    "the ability to recognise a blended event will of course depend on the amplitude of the event , for a given blending factor @xmath103 and a given duration @xmath108 .",
    "the amplitude is related to the impact parameter @xmath101 . consequently to get the expected fraction @xmath107 , at @xmath103 and @xmath108 it is sufficient to sum on the impact parameter @xmath101 , in the range 0 to @xmath109 ( @xmath109 is defined in eq 6 ) .",
    "the result of the corresponding calculation is illustrated in fig 11 , as a function of the blending factor , for a series of durations .",
    "the blended events are well identified only for small impact parameters . beyond @xmath110 ,",
    "the efficiency drops significantly , which makes the total efficiency quite low .",
    "these tabulated expressions of @xmath107 as a function of @xmath103 and @xmath108 are now introduced directly in the calculation of the unresolved event rates . then new rates corrected for the number of blended events which could be recognised are computed .",
    "fig 12 shows a comparison between this rate and the uncorrected rate in a case resembling to the ogle experiment .",
    "typical errors distributions are extrpolated from the duo experiment ( alard and guibert 1996 ) , and are divided by a scaling factor of 2 to take into account the better quality of the ogle photometry .",
    "the resulting errors distribution has a sigma about 0.07 magnitude for most of the points , and reaches 0.1 or slightly more in 10 percent of the cases ; it seems to be an acceptable description of the ogle photometry on stars close to the limiting magnitude , which represents most of the sample .",
    "we see that the difference is small , and considering that ogle has the best photometric accuracy , it is certainly worse again for the others experiments .",
    "+   + the conclusion is again , as for the color test , that given the mean quality of the photometry available in the microlensing experiments only , a slight percentage of blended events should be recognised on the basis of the light curve shape .",
    "only the the events with good photometry and small impact parameter should be identified as blended .",
    "however for some of the monitored stars the ogle experiment is able to perform photometry much better again than for the majority of the stars .",
    "this gives an interesting opportunity to look for a blending signature in the light curve .",
    "the photometry achieved on the ogle 5 event is of an interesting quality , the errors bars are as good as a few percent on many points . however",
    "this event is not well fitted with the standard unblended model ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is especially large in the wings of the event , so that it is natural to try to fit this event with blending .",
    "14 shows the dramatic improvement of the chi - square when a blended light curve is fitted .",
    "the best fit is obtained for a blending factor of 2.45 ( fig 15 . ) .",
    "thus makes the lensed source 1.34 magnitude fainter , and places it below the ogle detection limit .",
    "consequently it is very likely that ogle 5 is an example of lensing on an unresolved star .",
    "the better chi - square per degree of freedom is different from unity , but we have to recall that an event on an unresolved star is seen only by blending on a resolved star . for the photometry , the position of the resolved star is used , but it might be significantly different from the position of the true magnified star .",
    "the achieved errors in a psf fitting routine are rather sensitive to the quality of the positioning , thus we expect somewhat larger errors in the case of an unresolved event .",
    "the small discrepancy in the chi - square per degree of freedom is thus perfectly consistent with the scenario of an unresolved event .",
    "in this paper i show that the rates of microlensing events and optical depth to microlensing due to the unresolved stars can be modelled .",
    "however i emphasize that the exact rates and optical depth are closely related to the number of unresolved stars which will contribute per resolved star . this number is well constrained in crowded fields , essentially because the surface occupied by a star on the image is set by the crowding limit . on the other hand , this crowding limit is closely related to the resolution radius , thus the surface occupied by a star is just a function of this resolution radius .",
    "a value of 0.5 was found for @xmath53 ( the ratio of the surface covered by the resolution radius to the mean surface occupied by a star ) , both for duo and ogle .",
    "this simply means that probably there is a linear relation between the resolution radius and the mean radius per star .",
    "+ however in the crowded fields , if a new star appear at more than a resolution radius , it does not mean necessarily that it will be resolved .",
    "there are so many stars that it might well be confused with another one .",
    "this issue should be clarified later using monte - carlo simulation of crowded fields .",
    "this effect will probably lead to a slight increase of @xmath53 .",
    "another problem is that if the amplified star is situated at some distance from the resolved star the photometry which assumes fixed positions ( except for duo ) is certainly affected .",
    "this possibilty was already discussed in the case of ogle 5 and will cause a slight drop in the efficiency , which will increase as the unresolved star will be more distant form the resolved one .",
    "this issue could be also clarified later using monte - carlo simulation .",
    "but globally , this effect will more or less cancell out with the confusion effect exposed just before .",
    "thus to conclude , the value @xmath111 might be an acceptable approximation .",
    "the modeling of the unresolved star microlensing rates demonstrates that they induce an important bias for the short events .",
    "i show that given the current photometric errors , most of these events would be hard to distinguish from the unblended events .",
    "thus this is an important and annoying bias .",
    "if this bias is not taken into account , it will certainly influence the shape of the lens mass function estimated from the data .",
    "for instance , if a salpeter mass function is used , we expect that the lower cut - off will be shifted towards the brown dwarfs .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "16 where the total ogle rates ( resolved+unresolved ) are compared to the rates for salpeter mass functions with different lower cut - offs ( i recall that initially i used a salpeter mass function with a lower cut - off of @xmath112 to compute the ogle and duo rates ) . a better agreement with the total rates is found if the different trial models are slightly scaled .",
    "i calculated this scaling factor , so that the trial models give the same total rates in the range 0 to 80 days as the total rate ( see fig 16 . ) .",
    "the case of the duo experiment will be treated in another paper ( alard and guibert 1996 ) .",
    "while the unresolved star bias has to be taken into account , as demonstrated in the previous section , the modelling includes some uncertainties .",
    "however for the data set already assembled by the microlensing experiments , it is certainly an acceptable solution to the unresolved star bias . for the future ,",
    "a very interesting possibilty is offered by the planet ( sackett , 1995 ) collaboration , who will provide a dense and accurate sampling of the events .",
    "it will allow a much better control of the bias caused by the unresolved , using both color shift but importantly the shape of the light curve , as demonstrated for ogle 5 .",
    "+ to conclude , i will also emphasize that the contribution of the unresolved stars drops if the magnitude limit is increased .",
    "this is well illustrated by the comparison ogle vs. duo .",
    "consequently a first solution is to try to reach stars as faint as possible to minimise the bias .",
    "it is certainly a possible orientation for the ogleii experiment , which will achieve improved resolution better again with a new telescope . on the other hand for macho and erosii experiments , which use bigger pixels , and cover larger fields , an interesting solution is certainly to monitor the bright clump giants .",
    "these stars are much brighter ( about 3 magnitudes ) than most of the bulge stars , and their density per image is also much lower .",
    "thus , the unresolved stars per giant will be low and they will be so blended that the effective einsten radius will be very small .",
    "this idea leads to the conclusion that the unresolved star bias will be very small on clump giants .",
    "some other advantages of the clump giants include the good photometry expected , and also the possibility to have a sample with a very high completeness ( gould 1995 ) .",

    "<S> this paper presents an analysis of lensing of unresolved background stars . </S>",
    "<S> previous calculations of the lensing rates and optical depths considered only resolved stars . however , if a faint unresolved star lens is close enough to a resolved star , the event will be seen by the microlensing experiments and attributted to the bighter star . </S>",
    "<S> the blending biases the duration , making the contribution of the unresolved stars very significant for short events . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially annoying , because this contribution is confused with lensing by brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the exact rates of these blended events are extremly sensitive to the limiting magnitude achieved in the microlensing search . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate calculations of the optical depth and rates are provided here , and illustrated in the case of the duo and ogle experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the additional contribution of unresolved stars is very significant . </S>",
    "<S> it probably explains the high optical depth and rates observed towards the galactic bulge . </S>",
    "<S> the blended unresolved event can be identified using either the color shift or the light curve shape . </S>",
    "<S> however , neither of these two methods is apropriate to identify a large number of blended events towards the bulge . in some case of good </S>",
    "<S> photometry and small impact parameter an indentification is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the case of the ogle 5 event , which clearly appears as a case of lensing of an unresolved star . </S>",
    "<S> the recent results obtained by the planet collaboration indicate that a high resolution and dense sampling of the light curve is possible , and will probably provide a very interesting possibility to correct the blending bias , as demonstrated for ogle 5 . </S>",
    "<S> this possiblity , is certainly better than a statistical estimation of the lensing rates , which are always prone to some uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> but , at this time , the analysis of microlensing events found in the various microlensing experiments requires the uses of modelisations of the contribution of unresolved stars . </S>"
