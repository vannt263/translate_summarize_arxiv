    "in a study of non - attacking placements of chess pieces , chaiken , hanusa , and zaslavsky @xcite were led to a quasipolynomial formula that depends in part on the least common multiple of the determinants of all square submatrices of a certain kronecker product matrix , namely , the kronecker product of an integral @xmath5 matrix @xmath1 with the incidence matrix of a complete graph .",

    "we hope to determine in the future whether @xmath0 has a simple form for arbitrary matrices @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "our limited experimental data suggests this may be difficult .",
    "however , we think at least some generalization of theorem [ thm : lcmr ] is possible .",
    "we would like to understand , at minimum , why the theorem as stated fails when @xmath159 and @xmath1 has more than two columns .",
    "another direction worth investigating is the number - theoretic aspects of theorem [ thm : lcmr ] .",
    "during the proof we refer from time to time to example [ x : illustrative ] , which will give a concrete illustration of the many steps .",
    "we assume @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 are non - zero constants .",

    "we wish to evaluate the determinant of @xmath167 and show that it divides the right - hand side of equation .",
    "we need consider only matrices @xmath167 whose determinant is not zero , since a matrix with @xmath168 has no effect on the least common multiple .",
    "since @xmath169 is constructed from a graph , we will analyze @xmath167 from a graphic perspective .",
    "the matrix @xmath167 is a choice of @xmath170 rows and @xmath170 columns from @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to a choice of @xmath170 vertices and @xmath170 edges from @xmath28 where we are allowed to choose up to @xmath13 copies of each vertex and up to two copies of an edge .",
    "another way to say this is that we are choosing @xmath13 subsets of @xmath171 , say @xmath172 through @xmath173 , and two subsets of @xmath174 , say @xmath175 and @xmath176 , with the property that @xmath177 . from this point of view , if a row in @xmath167 is taken from the first @xmath2 rows of @xmath48 , we are placing the corresponding vertex of @xmath171 in @xmath172 , and so on , up through a row from the last @xmath2 rows of @xmath48 , which corresponds to a vertex in @xmath173 .",
    "we will say that the copy of @xmath26 in @xmath178 is the _ @xmath179 copy of @xmath26 _ and the copy of @xmath180 in @xmath181 is the _ @xmath182 copy of @xmath180_.    the order of @xmath167 satisfies @xmath183 because ,",
    "if @xmath167 had @xmath184 columns of @xmath48 , then at least one edge set , @xmath175 or @xmath176 , would contain @xmath2 edges from @xmath28 .",
    "the columns corresponding to these edges would form a dependent set of columns in @xmath167 , making @xmath185 .    in our illustrative example",
    ", choose the submatrix @xmath167 consisting of rows @xmath35 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 and columns @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath187 , and @xmath189 .",
    "then @xmath167 is the matrix @xmath190 and in the notation above , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "returning to the proof , within this framework we will now perform elementary matrix operations on @xmath167 in order to make its determinant easier to calculate .",
    "we call the resulting matrix the _ simplified matrix of @xmath167_. each copy of a vertex @xmath26 has a row in @xmath167 associated with it ; two rows corresponding to two copies of the same vertex contain the same entries except for the different multipliers @xmath196 .",
    "for example , if @xmath26 is a vertex in both @xmath172 and @xmath197 , then there is a row corresponding to the first copy with multipliers @xmath160 and @xmath161 and a row corresponding to the second copy with the same entries multiplied by @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "there can not be a vertex in three or more vertex sets since then the corresponding rows of @xmath167 would be linearly dependent and @xmath198 would be zero .    when there is a vertex in exactly two vertex sets @xmath178 and @xmath199 corresponding to two rows @xmath200 and @xmath201 in @xmath167 , we perform the following operations depending on the multipliers @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "we first notice that @xmath206 is non - zero ; otherwise , the rows @xmath200 and @xmath201 would be linearly dependent in @xmath167 and @xmath185 . therefore either both @xmath202 and @xmath205 or both @xmath203 and @xmath204 are non - zero . in the former case ,",
    "let us add @xmath207 times @xmath200 to @xmath201 in order to zero out the entries corresponding to edges in @xmath175 .",
    "the multipliers of entries in @xmath201 corresponding to edges in @xmath176 are now all @xmath208 .",
    "similarly , we can zero out the entries in @xmath200 corresponding to edges in @xmath176 .",
    "lastly , factor out @xmath209 from @xmath201 .",
    "if on the other hand , either multiplier @xmath202 or @xmath205 is zero , then reverse the roles of @xmath210 and @xmath211 in the preceding argument .",
    "these manipulations ensure that the multiplier of every non - zero entry in @xmath167 that corresponds to an @xmath179 vertex and a @xmath182 edge is @xmath196 .",
    "the appearance of a denominator , @xmath212 , in the factor @xmath209 is merely an artifact of the construction ; we could have cancelled it by factoring out @xmath202 in row @xmath210 and @xmath205 in row @xmath211 . however ,",
    "if we had done this , the entries of the matrix would no longer be of the form @xmath196 , @xmath213 , and @xmath137 , which would make the record - keeping in the coming arguments more tedious .    in our illustrative example",
    ", because @xmath33 is a member of both @xmath172 and @xmath197 , we perform row operations on the rows of @xmath167 corresponding to @xmath33 to yield the simplified matrix of @xmath167 : @xmath214 the determinants of @xmath167 and @xmath215 are related by @xmath216 the denominator @xmath217 would disappear if we had chosen to factor out the @xmath160 in the first row and the @xmath163 in the second row of @xmath215 .    returning to the proof , we assert that the simplified matrix of @xmath167 has no more that two non - zero entries in any column . for a column @xmath180 corresponding to an edge @xmath23 in @xmath28 ,",
    "each of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is either in one vertex set @xmath178 or in two vertex sets @xmath178 and @xmath199 .",
    "if the vertex corresponds to two rows in @xmath167 , the above manipulations ensure that there is only one copy of the vertex that has a non - zero multiplier in the column .",
    "another important quality of this simplification is that if a vertex is in more than one vertex set , then every edge incident with one instance of this repeated vertex is now in the same edge set ; more precisely , if @xmath218 , then every edge incident with the @xmath179 copy of @xmath26 is in @xmath175 and every edge incident with the @xmath219 copy is in @xmath176 , or vice versa .",
    "since we are assuming @xmath220 , @xmath167 has at least one non - zero entry in each column or row .",
    "if a row ( or column ) has exactly one non - zero entry , we can reduce the determinant by expanding in that row ( or column ) .",
    "this contributes that non - zero entry as a factor in the determinant . after reducing repeatedly in this way",
    ", we arrive at a matrix where each column has exactly two non - zero entries , and each row has at least two non - zero entries .",
    "this implies that every row has exactly two non - zero entries as well . after interchanging the necessary columns and rows and",
    "possibly multiplying columns by @xmath25 , the structure of what we will call the _ reduced matrix of @xmath167 _ is a block diagonal matrix where each block @xmath12 is a weighted incidence matrix of a cycle , such as @xmath221 the determinant of a @xmath222 matrix of this type is @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , we can write the determinant of @xmath167 as the product of powers of entries of @xmath1 , powers of @xmath224 , and binomials of this form .    in our illustrative example , we simplify the determinant of @xmath215 by expanding in the first row ( contributing a factor of @xmath160 ) , and we perform row and column operations to find the reduced matrix of @xmath167 to be @xmath225 whose determinant is @xmath226 .",
    "returning to the proof , the entries @xmath227 and @xmath228 are the variables @xmath196 , depending on in which vertex sets the rows lie and in which edge sets the columns lie .",
    "if the vertices of @xmath28 corresponding to the rows in @xmath12 are labeled @xmath33 through @xmath229 , this block of the block matrix corresponds to traversing the closed walk @xmath230 in @xmath28 ( in this direction ) . as a result of the form of the simplified matrix of @xmath167 , for a column that corresponds to an edge @xmath231 in @xmath181 traversed from the vertex @xmath232 in vertex",

    "now let us examine the exponents of factors of the form @xmath72 that may divide @xmath198 .",
    "such factors may arise either upon the conversion of @xmath167 to the simplified matrix of @xmath167 if @xmath259 , or from a block of the reduced matrix as in equation if @xmath270 .",
    "the factors that arise in simplification come from duplicate pairs of vertices : every duplicated vertex @xmath26 leads to a factor @xmath224 where @xmath218 ( this is apparent in equation ) . the total number of factors @xmath224 arising from simplification is @xmath271 , the number of duplicated vertices , which is not more than @xmath4 since @xmath272 .",
    "since each such factor divides @xmath80 , their product divides @xmath97 , the first component of equation .",
    "the factors @xmath273 from blocks @xmath12 of the reduced matrix arise from simple vertices  those which are not duplicated among the rows of @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath274 and @xmath275 are multisets of indices of vertex sets @xmath178 containing simple vertices , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 , the number of simple vertices , since a simple vertex appears in only one block . as @xmath278 , @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the product of the corresponding determinants @xmath273 is one product in the @xmath66 component of equation .",
    "we have shown that for every matrix @xmath167 , @xmath198 divides the right - hand side of equation .",
    "we now show that there exist graphs that attain the claimed powers of factors .",
    "consider the path of length @xmath4 , @xmath280 , as a subgraph of @xmath28 .",
    "create the @xmath281 submatrix @xmath167 of @xmath48 with rows corresponding to both an @xmath179 copy and a @xmath219 copy of vertices @xmath33 through @xmath282 and columns corresponding to two copies of every edge in @xmath283 . then @xmath284 with determinant @xmath285 .",
    "the four quadrants of @xmath167 are @xmath286 submatrices of @xmath48 with determinants @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 , and @xmath290 , respectively .",
    "we show that , for every collection @xmath291 satisfying @xmath292 , there is a submatrix @xmath167 of @xmath48 with determinant @xmath293 . for each @xmath133 , starting with @xmath294 ,",
    "choose @xmath295 to consist of the lowest - numbered unused @xmath296 vertices .",
    "thus , @xmath297 .",
    "take edges @xmath298 for @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "this creates a cycle @xmath301 if @xmath302 and an edge @xmath303 if @xmath304 . for a cycle @xmath301 , place each odd - indexed vertex of @xmath305 into a vertex set @xmath178 for every @xmath306 and each even - indexed vertex into a vertex set @xmath199 for every @xmath307 . for an edge @xmath303 corresponding to @xmath308 and @xmath309 , place both vertices of @xmath305 in @xmath178 and @xmath199 .",
    "place all edges of the form @xmath310 into @xmath175 and all edges of the form @xmath311 and @xmath300 into @xmath176 .",
    "note that this puts @xmath303 into both @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the submatrix @xmath167 of @xmath48 that arises from placing the vertices in numerical order and the edges in cyclic order along @xmath301 is the block - diagonal matrix where each block @xmath312 is a @xmath313 matrix of the form @xmath314 if @xmath301 is a cycle and @xmath315 if @xmath303 is an edge .",
