    "consider supercritical bond - percolation on @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 , and the simple random walk on the ( unique ) infinite cluster . in  @xcite",
    "sidoravicius and sznitman asked the following question : is it true that for a.e .",
    "configuration in which the origin belongs to the infinite cluster , the random walk started at the origin exits the infinite symmetric slab @xmath2 through the `` top '' side with probability tending to  @xmath3 as @xmath4 ?",
    "sidoravicius and sznitman managed to answer their question affirmatively in dimensions  @xmath5 but dimensions  @xmath6 remained open . in this paper",
    "we extend the desired conclusion to all  @xmath1 . as in  @xcite , we will do so by proving a quenched invariance principle for the paths of the walk .    random walk on percolation clusters is only one of many instances of `` statistical mechanics in random media '' that have been recently considered by physicists and mathematicians .",
    "other pertinent examples include , e.g. , various diluted spin systems , random copolymers  @xcite , spin glasses  @xcite , random - graph models  @xcite , etc . from this general perspective , the present problem is interesting for at least two reasons : first , a good handle on simple random walk on a given graph is often a prerequisite for the understanding of more complicated processes , e.g. , self - avoiding walk or loop - erased random walk .",
    "second , information about the scaling properties of simple random walk on percolation cluster can , in principle , reveal some new important facts about the structure of the infinite cluster and/or its harmonic properties .",
    "let us begin developing the mathematical layout of the problem .",
    "let  @xmath0 be the @xmath7-dimensional hypercubic lattice and let  @xmath8 be the set of nearest neighbor edges .",
    "we will use  @xmath9 to denote a generic edge ,  @xmath10 to denote the edge between  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , and  @xmath13 to denote the edges from the origin to its nearest neighbors .",
    "let  @xmath14 be the space of all percolation configurations  @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 indicates that the edge  @xmath9 is occupied and  @xmath17 implies that it is vacant .",

    "measure such that  @xmath22 for all  @xmath23 .",

    "let  @xmath33 denote the percolation threshold on  @xmath0 defined as the infimum of all  @xmath34 s for which @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 and , for  @xmath37 , define the measure  @xmath38 by @xmath39 we will use  @xmath40 to denote expectation with respect to  @xmath38 .    for each configuration @xmath41",
    ", let @xmath42 be the simple random walk on @xmath43 started at the origin .",
    "explicitly , @xmath42 is a markov chain with state space  @xmath0 , whose distribution  @xmath44 is defined by the transition probabilities @xmath45 and @xmath46 with the initial condition @xmath47 thus , at each unit of time , the walk picks a neighbor at random and if the corresponding edge is occupied , the walk moves to this neighbor .",
    "if the edge is vacant , the move is suppressed .",
    "our main result is that for @xmath38-almost every @xmath41 , the linear interpolation of @xmath48 , properly scaled , converges weakly to brownian motion . for every  @xmath49 ,",
    "let  @xmath50,{\\mathscr{w } } _ t)$ ] be the space of continuous functions  @xmath51\\to{\\mathbb r}$ ] equipped with the @xmath19-algebra  @xmath52 of borel sets relative to the supremum topology .",
    "the precise statement is now as follows :    [ thm : mainthm ] let  @xmath1 , @xmath53 and let  @xmath41 .",
    "let  @xmath42 be the random walk with law  @xmath44 and let @xmath54 then for all  @xmath49 and for  @xmath38-almost every  @xmath25 , the law of  @xmath55 on @xmath50,{\\mathscr{w } } _ t)$ ] converges weakly to the law of an isotropic brownian motion @xmath56 whose diffusion constant , @xmath57 , depends only on the percolation parameter  @xmath34 and the dimension  @xmath7 .",
    "the markov chain  @xmath42 represents only one of two natural ways to define a simple random walk on the supercritical percolation cluster .",
    "another possibility is that , at each unit of time , the walk moves to a site chosen uniformly at random from the _ accessible _ neighbors , i.e. , the walk takes no pauses . in order to define this process ,",
    "let  @xmath58 be the sequence of stopping times that mark the moments when the walk  @xmath42 made a move .",
    "explicitly , @xmath59 and @xmath60 using these stopping times  which are  @xmath44-almost surely finite for all  @xmath41we define a new markov chain  @xmath61 by @xmath62 it is easy to see that  @xmath61 has the desired distribution .",
    "indeed , the walk starts at the origin and its transition probabilities are given by @xmath63 a simple modification of the arguments leading to theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] allows us to establish a functional central limit theorem for this random walk as well :    [ thm:2ndmainthm ] let  @xmath1 , @xmath53 and let  @xmath41 .",
    "let  @xmath64 be the random walk defined from  @xmath42 as described in   and let @xmath65 be the linear interpolation of  @xmath66 defined by   with  @xmath67 replaced by  @xmath68 .",
    "then for all  @xmath49 and for  @xmath38-almost every  @xmath25 , the law of  @xmath69 on @xmath50,{\\mathscr{w } } _ t)$ ] converges weakly to the law of an isotropic brownian motion @xmath56 whose diffusion constant , @xmath70 , depends only on the percolation parameter  @xmath34 and the dimension  @xmath7 .",
    "de gennes  @xcite , who introduced the problem of random walk on percolation cluster to the physics community , thinks of the walk as the motion of `` an ant in a labyrinth . ''",
    "from this perspective , the `` lazy '' walk  @xmath48 corresponds to a `` blind '' ant , while the `` agile '' walk @xmath71 represents a `` myopic '' ant .",
    "while the character of the scaling limit of the two `` ants '' is the same , there seems to be some distinction in the rate the scaling limit is approached , cf  @xcite and references therein . as we will see in the proof , the diffusion constants  @xmath72 and  @xmath73 are related via  @xmath74 , where  @xmath75 is the expected degree of the origin normalized by  @xmath76 , cf  .",
    "there is actually yet another way how to `` put '' simple random walk on  @xmath28 , and that is to use continuous time . here",
    "the corresponding result follows by combining the clt for the `` lazy '' walk with an appropriate renewal theorem for exponential waiting times .",
    "the subject of random walk in random environment has a long history ; we refer to , e.g. ,  @xcite for recent overviews of ( certain parts of ) this field . on general grounds ,",
    "each random - media problem comes in two distinct flavors : _ quenched _ , corresponding to the situations discussed above where the walk is distributed according to an  @xmath25-dependent measure  @xmath44 , and _ annealed _ , in which the path distribution of the walk is taken from the averaged measure  @xmath77 . under suitable ergodicity assumptions , the annealed problem typically corresponds to the quenched problem averaged over the starting point .",
    "yet the distinction is clear : in the annealed setting the slab - exit problem from sect .  [ sec1.1 ] is trivial by the symmetries of the averaged measure , while its answer is _ a priori _ very environment - sensitive in the quenched measure .",
    "an annealed version of our theorems was proved in the 1980s by de masi  _ et al _",
    "@xcite , based on earlier results of kozlov  @xcite , kipnis and varadhan  @xcite and others in the context of random walk in a field of random conductances .",
    "( the results of  @xcite were primarily two - dimensional but , with the help of  @xcite , they apply to all  @xmath1 ; cf  @xcite . )",
    "a number of proofs of quenched invariance principles have appeared in recent years for the cases where an annealed principle was already known .",
    "the most relevant paper is that of sidoravicius and sznitman  @xcite which established theorem  [ thm:2ndmainthm ] for random walk among random conductances in all  @xmath78 and , using a very different method , also for random walk on percolation in  @xmath5 .",
    "( thus our main theorem is new only in  @xmath6 . )",
    "the  @xmath5 proof is based on the fact that two independent random walk paths will intersect only very little  something hard to generalize to  @xmath6 . as this paper shows ,",
    "the argument for random conductances is somewhat more flexible .",
    "another paper of relevance is that of rassoul - agha and sepplinen  @xcite where a quenched invariance principle was established for _ directed _ random walks in ( space - time ) random environments .",
    "the directed setting offers the possibility to use independence more efficiently  every time step the walk enters a new environment  but the price to pay for this is the lack of reversibility .",
    "the directed nature of the environment also permits consideration of distributions with a drift for which a clt is not even expected to generally hold in the undirected setting ; see  @xcite for an example of `` pathologies '' that may arise .    finally , there have been been a number of results dealing with harmonic properties of the simple random walk on percolation clusters .",
    "grimmett , kesten and zhang  @xcite proved via `` electrostatic techniques '' that this random walk is transient in  @xmath79 ; extensions concerning the existence of various `` energy flows '' appeared in  @xcite . a great amount of effort has been spent on deriving estimates on the heat - kernel  i.e .",
    ", the probability that the walk is at a particular site after  @xmath80 steps .",
    "the first such bounds were obtained by heicklen and hoffman  @xcite . later mathieu and",
    "remy  @xcite realized that the right way to approach heat - kernel estimates was through harmonic function theory of the infinite cluster and thus significantly improved the results of  @xcite .",
    "finally , barlow  @xcite obtained , using again harmonic function theory , gaussian upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for further references concerning this area of research .",
    "_ note _ : at the time a preprint version of this paper was first circulated , we learned that mathieu and piatnitski had announced a proof of the same result ( albeit in continuous - time setting ) .",
    "their proof , which has in the meantime been posted  @xcite , is close in spirit to that of theorem  1.1 of  @xcite ; the main tools are poincar inequalities , heat - kernel estimates and homogenization theory .",
    "let us outline the main steps of our proof of theorems  [ thm : mainthm ] and  [ thm:2ndmainthm ] .",
    "the principal idea  which permeates in various disguises throughout the work of papanicolau and varadhan  @xcite , kozlov  @xcite , kipnis and varadhan  @xcite , de masi _ et al _",
    "@xcite , sidoravicius and sznitman  @xcite and others  is to consider an embedding of  @xmath43 into the euclidean space that makes the corresponding simple random walk a martingale .",
    "formally , this is achieved by finding an  @xmath81-valued discrete harmonic function on  @xmath28 with a linear growth at infinity .",
    "the distance between the natural position of a site  @xmath82 and its counterpart in this _ harmonic embedding _ is expressed in terms of the so - called _ corrector _  @xmath83 which is a principal object of study in this paper .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an illustration .",
    "it is clear that the corrector can be defined in any finite volume by solving an appropriate discrete dirichlet problem ( this is how fig .",
    "1 was drawn ) ; the difficult part is to define the corrector in infinite volume while maintaining the natural ( distributional ) invariance with respect to shifts of the underlying lattice . actually , there is an alternative , probabilistic definition of the corrector , @xmath84 however , the only proof we presently have for the existence of such a limit is by following , rather closely , the constructions from sect .",
    "[ sec2.3 ] .",
    "once we have the corrector under control , the proof splits into two parts : ( 1 )  proving that the martingale  i.e . , the walk on the deformed graph  converges to brownian motion and ( 2 )  proving that the deformation of the path caused by the change of embedding is negligible . the latter part ( which is the principal contribution of this work ) amounts to a sublinear bound on the corrector  @xmath83 as a function of  @xmath11 . here",
    ", somewhat unexpectedly , our level of control is considerably better in  @xmath85 than in  @xmath79 . in particular ,",
    "our proof in  @xmath85 avoids using any of the recent sophisticated discrete - harmonic analyses but , to handle all  @xmath1 uniformly , we need to invoke the main result of barlow  @xcite .",
    "the proof is actually carried out along these lines only for the setting in theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] ; theorem  [ thm:2ndmainthm ] follows by noting that the time scales of both walks are comparable .",
    "here is a summary of the rest of this paper : in sect .",
    "[ sec : defcor ] we introduce the aforementioned corrector and prove some of its basic properties .",
    "[ sec : erg ] collects the needed facts about ergodic properties of the markov chain `` on environments . ''",
    "both sections are based on previously known material ; proofs have been included to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the novel parts of the proof  sublinear bounds on the corrector  appear in sects .",
    "[ sec : sec4]-[sec : sublin ] .",
    "the actual proofs of our main theorems are carried out in sect .",
    "[ sec : invprnp ] . the appendix ( sects .",
    "[ appa ] and  [ appb ] ) contains the proof of an upper bound for the transition probabilities of our random walk , further discussion and some conjectures .",
    "in this section we will define and study the aforementioned corrector which is the basic instrument of our proofs .",
    "the main idea is to consider the markov chain `` on environments '' ( sect .",
    "[ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "the relevant properties of the corrector are listed in theorem  [ thm2.1 ] ( sect .",
    "[ sec2.2 ] ) ; the proofs are based on spectral calculus ( see sect .  [ sec2.3 ] ) .      as is well known , cf  kipnis and varadhan  @xcite , the markov chain  @xmath42 in ( [ e:1.3][e:1.4 ] ) induces a markov chain on  @xmath86 , which can be interpreted as the trajectory of `` environments viewed from the perspective of the walk . ''",
    "the transition probabilities of this chain are given by the kernel @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 our basic observations about the induced markov chain are as follows :    [ lemma1.1 ] for every bounded measurable  @xmath89 and every  @xmath13 with  @xmath90 , @xmath91 where  @xmath92 is the bond that is opposite to  @xmath13 .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath38 is reversible and , in particular , stationary for markov kernel  @xmath93 .",
    "proof first we will prove  . neglecting the normalization by  @xmath94 , we need that @xmath95 this will follow from @xmath96 and the fact that , on  @xmath97 we have @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , these observations imply @xmath99 and   then follows by the shift invariance of  @xmath21 .",
    "from   we deduce that for any bounded , measurable  @xmath100 , @xmath101 where  @xmath102 is the function @xmath103 indeed , splitting the last sum into two terms , the second part reproduces exactly on both sides of  .",
    "for the first part we apply   and note that averaging over  @xmath13 allows us to neglect the negative sign in front of  @xmath13 on the right - hand side .",
    "but   is the _ definition _ of reversibility and , setting  @xmath104 and noting that  @xmath105 , we also get the stationarity of  @xmath38 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] underlines our main reason to work primarily with the `` lazy '' walk . for the `` agile '' walk , to get a stationary law on environments , one has to weigh  @xmath38 by the degree of the origin  a factor that would drag through the entire derivation .",
    "next we will adapt the construction of kipnis and varadhan  @xcite to the present situation .",
    "let  @xmath106 be the space of all borel - measurable , square integrable functions on  @xmath20 . abusing the notation slightly , we will use `` @xmath107 '' both for @xmath108-valued functions as well as  @xmath81-valued functions .",
    "we equip  @xmath107 with the inner product @xmath109with `` @xmath110 '' interpreted as the dot product of  @xmath111 and  @xmath112 when these functions are vector - valued .",

    "note that , when applied to a vector - valued function ,  @xmath93 acts like a scalar , i.e. , independently on each component .    from   we know @xmath113 and so  @xmath93 is symmetric .",
    "an explicit calculation gives us @xmath114 and so  @xmath115 .",
    "in particular ,  @xmath93 is self - adjoint and @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "let  @xmath117 be the local drift at the origin , i.e. , @xmath118 ( we will only be interested in  @xmath119 for  @xmath41 , but that is of no consequence here . ) clearly , since @xmath120 is bounded , we have  @xmath121 . for each  @xmath122 ,",
    "let  @xmath123 be the solution of @xmath124 since  @xmath125 is a non - negative operator ,  @xmath126 is well - defined and  @xmath127 for all @xmath122 .",
    "the following theorem is the core of the whole theory :    [ thm2.1 ] there is a function  @xmath128 such that for every  @xmath29 , @xmath129 moreover , the following properties hold :    1 .",

    "the rest of this section is spent on proving theorem  [ thm2.1 ] . the proof is based on spectral calculus and it closely follows the corresponding arguments from  @xcite .",
    "alternative constructions invoke projection arguments , cf  @xcite .",

    "the first observation , made already by kipnis and varadhan , is stated as follows :    [ lemma2.2 ] @xmath141    proof with some caution concerning the infinite cluster , the proof is a combination of arguments right before theorem  1.3 of  @xcite and those in the proof of theorem  4.1 of  @xcite .",
    "let  @xmath142 be a bounded real - valued function and note that , by lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] and the symmetry of the sums , @xmath143 hence , for every  @xmath144 we get @xmath145 the first term on the right - hand side equals a constant times  @xmath146 , while lemma  [ lemma1.1 ] allows us to rewrite the second term into @xmath147 we thus get that there exists a constant  @xmath148 such that for all bounded  @xmath142 , @xmath149 applying   for  @xmath111 of the form  @xmath150 , summing  @xmath151 over coordinate vectors in  @xmath81 and invoking , we find that for every bounded continuous @xmath152\\to{\\mathbb r}$ ] and  @xmath153 , @xmath154 substituting  @xmath155 for  @xmath156 and noting that  @xmath157 , we get @xmath158 and so @xmath159 the monotone convergence theorem now implies @xmath160 proving the desired claim .    using spectral calculus we will now prove :    [ lemma2.3 ] let  @xmath126 be as defined in",
    ". then @xmath161 moreover , for  @xmath13 with  @xmath90 let @xmath162 .",
    "then for all  @xmath29 and all  @xmath13 with  @xmath90 , @xmath163    proof the main ideas are again taken more or less directly from the proof of theorem  1.3 in  @xcite ; some caution is necessary regarding the containment in the infinite cluster in the proof of  . by the definition of  @xmath126 , @xmath164 the integrand",
    "is dominated by  @xmath165 and tends to zero as  @xmath166 for every  @xmath167 in the support of  @xmath135",
    ". then   follows by the dominated convergence theorem .",
    "the second part of the claim is proved similarly : first we get rid of the  @xmath11-dependence by noting that , due to the fact that @xmath168 enforces  @xmath82 , the translation invariance of  @xmath21 implies @xmath169 next we square the right - hand side and average over all  @xmath13 . using that  @xmath170 also enforces  @xmath171 and applying  , we thus get @xmath172",
    "now we calculate @xmath173 the integrand is again bounded by  @xmath165 , for all  @xmath174 , and it tends to zero as  @xmath175 .",
    "the claim follows by the dominated convergence theorem .",

    "we know that  @xmath176 converges in  @xmath107 as  @xmath166 .",

    "here we will establish some basic claims whose common feature is the use of ergodic theory .",
    "modulo some care for the containment in the infinite cluster , all of these results are quite standard and their proofs ( cf  sect .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] ) may be skipped on a first reading .",
    "readers interested only in the principal conclusions of this section should focus their attention on theorems  [ thm3.1 ] and  [ thm3.2 ] .",
    "our first result concerns the convergence of ergodic averages for the markov chain on environments .",
    "the claim that will suffice for our later needs is as follows :    [ thm3.1 ] let  @xmath197 .",
    "then for  @xmath38-almost all  @xmath198 , @xmath199 similarly , if  @xmath200 is measurable with @xmath201 , then @xmath202 for  @xmath38-almost all  @xmath25 and  @xmath44-almost all trajectories of  @xmath203 .    the next principal result of this section will be the ergodicity of the `` induced shift '' on  @xmath86 . to define this concept ,",

    "@xmath41 , there exists only one vector - valued function  @xmath555 on  @xmath43 such that @xmath187 is harmonic on  @xmath43 , @xmath788 and  @xmath789 as  @xmath790 ?",
    "if this question is answered in the affirmative , we could generate the corrector by its finite - volume approximations ( this would also fully justify fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to functions that have the shift - invariance property , uniqueness can presumably be shown using the `` electrostatic methods '' from , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether holds for the corrector defined by the thermodynamic limit from finite boxes .    as to the more detailed properties of the corrector , for the purposes of the present work one would like to know how @xmath83 scales with  @xmath11 and whether it has a well - defined scaling limit .",
    "we believe that , in sufficiently high dimension , the corrector is actually tight :    [ conj4 ] let  @xmath791 .",
    "then for each  @xmath122 there exists  @xmath409 such that @xmath792 for all @xmath29 .",
    "it appears that one might be able to prove conjecture  [ conj4 ] by using barlow s heat - kernel estimates . to capture the behavior in low dimensions ,",
    "we make a somewhat wilder guess :    [ conj5 ] let @xmath78",
    ". then the law of  @xmath793 on compact subsets of  @xmath81 converges weakly ( as @xmath166 ) to gaussian free field , i.e. , a multivariate gaussian field with covariance proportional to  @xmath794 , where  @xmath483 is the dirichlet laplacian on  @xmath81 and  @xmath795 is the @xmath7-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "here is a heuristic reasoning that led us to these conjectures : consider the problem of random conductances to avoid problems with conditioning on containment in the infinite cluster . to show the above convergence , we need that for any smooth  @xmath796 with compact support , @xmath797 where  @xmath798 and  @xmath483 denote the ( continuous ) gradient and laplacian , respectively , and where  @xmath799 is a mean - zero , covariance-@xmath370 multivariate normal random variable .",
    "next we note that the corrector is defined , more or less , as the solution to the equation @xmath800 , where  @xmath120 is the local drift and  @xmath801 is the relevant generator , which is basically a discrete laplacian on  @xmath0 . thus",
    ", if  @xmath802 is smooth with compact support and  @xmath803 , then @xmath804 the convergence statement would then follow from provided we can replace the `` discretized '' laplacian @xmath805 by its continuous counterpart @xmath806 .",
    "note that for  @xmath782 and conductances bounded away from zero , conjecture  [ conj5 ] is actually a theorem .",
    "indeed , the corrector is a random walk with increments given by reciprocal conductances and so the convergence follows by the invariance principle for random walks .",
    "conjecture  [ conj5 ] suggests that conjecture  [ conj4 ] applies for  @xmath79 .    despite the emphasis on the harmonic embedding of  @xmath28 ,",
    "our proofs used , quite significantly , the underlying group structure of  @xmath0 ; e.g. , in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "presumably this will not prevent application of our method to other regular lattices , but for more irregular graphs , e.g. , voronoi percolation in  @xmath81 , significant changes may be necessary .",
    "a similar discussion applies to various natural subdomains of  @xmath0 ; for instance , it is not clear how to adapt our proof to random walk on the infinite percolation cluster in the half - space @xmath807 .",
    "a different direction of generalizations are the models of _ long - range _ percolation with power - law decay of bond probabilities . here",
    "we conjecture :    [ conj : stable ] let  @xmath78 and consider long - range percolation obtained by adding to  @xmath0 a bond between every two distinct sites  @xmath808 independently with probability proportional to  @xmath809 .",
    "if  @xmath810 , then the corresponding random walk scales to a symmetric  @xmath811-stable levy process in  @xmath81 .",
    "note that , according to this conjecture , in  @xmath782 , the interval  @xmath810 of `` interesting '' exponents is larger than the interval for which an infinite connected component may occur even without the `` help '' of nearest neighbor connections . on the other hand , in dimensions  @xmath79 , the interval conjectured for stable convergence is strictly smaller than that of `` genuine '' long - range percolation behavior , as defined , e.g. , in terms of the scaling of graph distance with euclidean distance ; cf  @xcite .",
