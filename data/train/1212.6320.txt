    "although we are witnessing the discovery of new classes of superconductors that include the iron - based and organic superconductors,@xcite the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors stand out in having the highest-@xmath0 to date . specifically , among various families of the cuprate , the highest @xmath0 occurs in the multilayered cuprates that have @xmath2 cuo@xmath3 planes in a unit cell , typically the hg - based hgba@xmath4ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( hg-@xmath8 ) , where @xmath0 depends on the number , @xmath2 , of the cuo@xmath3 planes with @xmath0 increasing for @xmath9 to @xmath10 and decreasing slightly for @xmath11 , and hg-@xmath12 is still the highest @xmath0 superconductor.@xcite empirically , the electronic band structure has been probed with arpes for the bi - based triple - layer cuprate ( bi-@xmath13).@xcite another experiment examines the optical josephson plasma modes@xcite arising from interlayer josephson couplings from the reflectivity spectra in the hg - based multilayered cuprates for @xmath14 to @xmath15 , where the change in the josephson coupling strength is shown to be correlated with @xmath0.@xcite    there have been several theoretical studies for multilayered cuprates : anderson and chakravarty proposed that an interlayer josephson coupling that arises as a process second - order in the interlayer one - electron hopping enhances the superconductivity.@xcite although this mechanism may be related to the @xmath16-axis coherence , it is considered to be insufficient for increasing @xmath0 because the realistic magnitude of @xmath17 is an order of magnitude smaller than the intralayer one ( @xmath18 ) , so the interlayer josephson pair tunneling ( @xmath19 ) in this picture is too small to enhance the superconductivity .",
    "chakravarty also studied the effect of the interlayer josephson pair tunneling phenomenologically in a macroscopic ginzburg - landau free energy scheme.@xcite on the other hand , leggett examined a coulomb energy in the @xmath16-axis layering structure,@xcite while okamoto _",

    "have also examined an effect of the interlayer tunneling in terms of a free energy derived from @xmath18-@xmath20 model in a case where the phenomenological interlayer coupling is chosen to realize the in - phase gap function between the two layers.@xcite given the background , our purpose here is to _ microscopically _ investigate a mechanism of the superconductivity in multilayered cuprates focusing on the effects of _ microscopic interlayer pair hopping_. we envisage that the interlayer pair hopping arises as the matrix elements of long - range coulomb interaction , rather than a process second - order in the interlayer one - electron hopping or phenomenological josephson coupling .",
    "motivated by this , we start from a double - layer hubbard model to explore microscopically the multilayered cuprates by examining various interlayer processes .",
    "the interlayer one - electron hopping has turned out to exert little effects on the first - principles band structure ( not shown ) , so that we turn to the interlayer pair hopping .",
    "the hopping of cooper pairs across the layers should in general exist as a matrix element of the long - range coulomb interaction,@xcite and this should affect superconductivity as a process intrinsic in multilayer systems , but whether and how the superconductivity is enhanced has not been well understood .",
    "since we are talking about @xmath1-wave pairing that basically mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations around specific regions in @xmath21-space , we have to adopt a method that can incorporate @xmath21-dependent pairing interactions .",
    "hence we adopt here fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation,@xcite whose result is fed into the eliashberg equation .",
    "we shall show that the interlayer pair hopping acts both ways to increase the pairing interaction and decrease the quasi - particle life time ( with an increased self - energy ) , but the former effect is found to supersedes the latter and enhances superconductivity , along with how the sign of the interlayer off - site pair hopping determines the relative configuration of @xmath1-wave between the adjacent layers .",
    "we have extended the study to the triple - layer case with the interlayer pair hopping , where we show that the superconductivity is further enhanced but only sublinearly with the number of layers with a tendency for saturation toward the triple - layer case .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian of the double - layer model @xmath22 with the interlayer pair hopping @xmath23 , @xmath24 where the one - electron kinetic energy , @xmath25 and the hubbard interaction , @xmath26 are defined in a usual way , with @xmath27 creating an electron at @xmath28-th site with spin @xmath29 in the layer @xmath30 , @xmath31 the transfer integral and @xmath32 the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "@xmath33 consists of the intralayer ( @xmath34 ) and interlayer ( @xmath35 ) one - electron hoppings , where the intralayer component is here considered for the nearest - neighbor @xmath36 ev , second - neighbor @xmath37 ev up to the third - neighbor @xmath38 ev . for the interlayer",
    "one - electron hopping we take a usually adopted form , @xmath39 in @xmath21-space,@xcite with @xmath40 ev here .",
    "these values of the one - electron hoppings are basically determined by a downfolding from the first - principles bands , but we here make a simplification in which we take common values between the single- , double- , and triple - layer cases for a transparent comparison .    now the question is the form of the interlayer pair hopping @xmath23 . here",
    "we take a rather general form @xmath41 , where in addition to the usually considered interlayer on - site pair hopping , @xmath42 we also consider _ interlayer off - site pair hopping _ , @xmath43 , where the first term , @xmath44 is the hopping of a spin - singlet pair formed on nearest - neighbor intralayer sites from one layer to another , with @xmath45 denoting a sum over nearest - neighbors .",
    "in addition , we have to note that , if we want to preserve the spin su(2 ) symmetry , we should include @xmath46 in which the spins of the pair are exchanged during the hop ( fig . [ fig : phfig ] ) . while the on - site term is considered to be the largest interlayer pair hopping , the off - site terms should be not only the second largest interlayer pair hopping arising from long - range coulomb interaction , but may also play a crucial role for @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "now , the flex approximation , which is a conserved approximation with bubble and ladder diagrams included@xcite , is one of the standard methods for self - consistently treating the spin- and charge - fluctuation mediated pairing with the self - energy effect incorporated@xcite .",
    "let us start with showing that the method can be extended for treating the pair - hopping processes introduced here .",

    "[ fig : eigval ] is for the model with interlayer on - site pair hopping @xmath78 only , where the pair hopping is seen to _ suppress _ the superconductivity in fact .",
    "this result , which may at first seem strange since an interlayer pairing interaction would naively enhance the superconductivity , comes from the following fact . the interlayer pair",
    "hopping does produce an interlayer pairing interaction as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vip ] , which is expected to enhance the intralayer superconducting gap functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the sense of suhl - kondo mechanism@xcite . however , the interlayer pair hopping also increases the ( intralayer ) self - energy .",
    "an increased self - energy is a bad news for superconductivity , and the result here indicates that this effect supersedes the enhanced interlayer pairing interaction . if we look at fig .",
    "[ fig : vip](a ) , the interlayer pairing interaction @xmath73 only shows barely visible peaks around @xmath85 .",
    "this is because the interlayer on - site pair hopping hamiltonian has no @xmath21-dependence to start with , and flex diagrams do not render a significant @xmath21-dependence .",

    "[ fig : eigval ] representing this situation shows that the superconductivity is enhanced _ even above _ the case when @xmath79 alone is switched on .",

    "[ fig : vip](c ) , @xmath73 with both of @xmath78 and @xmath79 switched on is more reinforced around @xmath85 than when @xmath87 alone is present .",
    "the increase in @xmath73 is caused by the process in which @xmath78 raises the peaks of @xmath73 around @xmath85 from @xmath79 through the spin - fluctuation term @xmath88 in ( [ eq : veff ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the effects of the other interlayer off - site pair hopping @xmath81 .",
    "the term is required for the su(2 ) , but , being a spin - flip interaction , does complicate the diagrams as follows .",

    "[ fig : phfig](b ) .",
    "we can readily extend the flex when all the interactions are of the spin - flip form , where the formulation is similar to the usual flex .",
