    "in @xcite it is introduced the oriented subgroup @xmath0 of r. thompson group @xmath2 consisting of those elements for which the associated @xmath5-graph ( as described therein ) is bipartite . in turn , this is also the subgroup of @xmath2 of elements for which there exists a canonical orientation on the associated link diagram @xmath6 by means of seifert surfaces ( as explained in @xcite , @xmath6 is uniquely defined up to distant unknots arising from opposite carets ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath0 is isomorphic to the thompson group @xmath7 defined using triadic subdivisions @xcite . in the sequel",
    "we will denote the oriented link diagram associated to @xmath8 by @xmath9 therefore , it is meaningful to compute invariants of oriented links on the elements of @xmath0 , after a suitable normalization to get rid of the distant unknots .",
    "we thus introduce the jones function @xmath10 , that is equal to the jones polynomial @xmath11 up to a multiplicative factor ensuring that it is well - defined as a function on @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite we proved that the renormalized kauffman bracket , agreeing with @xmath12 up to a suitable factor , provides a function of positive type on @xmath2 for certain special values of the variable @xmath13 , which actually form a finite set of roots of unity .",
    "therefore , in view of the close relationship between the kauffman bracket and the jones polynomial , a natural question is whether also the jones function @xmath10 gives rise to functions of positive type on @xmath0 , at least for some specific values of the variable @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we take up this issue and answer this question in the affirmative .",
    "a bit unexpectedly , the evaluations selected in this way correspond to specific values of the jones polynomial that have already attracted some interest in the literature , mainly because they admit a geometrical interpretation .",
    "moreover , proceeding along similar lines , we are able to extend the arguments to cover also some specialisations of the ( renormalized ) two - variable kauffman polynomial and the homfly polynomial .    a major ingredient in the proof of these results is the possibility to represent these invariants as partition functions of suitably defined statistical mechanical models .",
    "it is also natural to investigate analogous problems for the larger groups @xmath15 .",
    "we show that all the results about the tutte polynomial and the kauffman bracket obtained in @xcite remain true without modifications for @xmath3 , as well as those about the jones polynomial for @xmath1 .    in a continuation of this project",
    ", one might also determine which evaluations of the jones function ( or of some closely related function ) belong to the linear span of the functions of positive type , namely they lie in the fourier - stieltjes algebra @xmath16 , or even in some other space of multipliers .",
    "all in all , one might wonder whether this circle of ideas from low - dimensional topology may provide any valuable information on the various multiplier spaces of @xmath0 ( and @xmath2 ) .",
    "we plan to return to these issues elsewhere .",
    "this section is devoted to indroducing the definition of the jones - thompson group @xmath0 and recalling the fundamental properties of some polynomial invariants for oriented links . in the first place ( see @xcite ) we recall that the group @xmath3 can be defined as the group generated by two families of elements @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that    1 .",

    "the jones - thompson group can then be defined as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the chromatic polynomial of the graph @xmath5 .",
    "golan and sapir proved that this group is finitely generated exhibiting some generators ( @xcite , lemma 4.6 ) , namely @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "* lemma 4.7 ) .    using @xmath27 , jones ( @xcite ) discovered a way to associate an oriented link to any element of the jones - thompson group .",
    "we briefly outline this procedure in the following example .",

    "the homfly polynomial and jones polynomial are laurent polynomial satisfying the so - called skein relations , namely @xmath35 the @xmath4-variable kauffman polynomial , the homfly polynomial and the jones polynomial satisfy the following properties @xmath36f_{\\vec{l}_1}f_{\\vec{l}_2}\\\\ f_o= 1\\\\          \\end{array }          \\right .",

    "building upon our previous work @xcite , we now focus on the problem of determining for which specialisations of the variable the jones polynomial gives rise to a positive type function on @xmath0 .",
    "a first result in this direction comes from the notion of 3-colourings ( see @xcite , p. 162 ) .",
    "we proved in @xcite that the number of @xmath38-colourings @xmath47 defines a positive definite function on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it has been observed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.13 ) that @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the two - variable kauffman polynomial .",
    "therefore , we immediately obtain the following result .",
    "[ threecol ] the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are of positive type on @xmath2 .",
    "in particular they are of positive type on @xmath0 .",
    "notice that in the previous statement we have considered @xmath50 with @xmath52 since , for @xmath14 a complex number of modulus one , @xmath53 is actually independent of the orientation of the components of the link @xmath54 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as well as @xmath55 .",
    "it is well - known that for an oriented link @xmath56 , @xmath57 coincides with @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "we proved in @xcite that the kauffman bracket function is of positive type on @xmath2 when evaluated at certain roots of unity . in order to examine the issue whether the jones polynomial gives rise to a function of positive type",

    "it may seem unlikely that this function is of positive type for all values of @xmath13 . however , this function is trivially of positive type when @xmath62 ( see remark [ tequal1 ] ) , so it is certainly meaningful to ask for which values of @xmath13 it is actually of positive type . given an element @xmath63 , consider the family of links associated to @xmath64 .",
    "all these links differ by the addition of distant unknots .",
    "the writhe computed on any of these links assumes always the same value .",
    "therefore , we have a ( well defined ) writhe function @xmath65 , where @xmath9 denotes any oriented link associated to @xmath66 , and it makes sense to consider the function @xmath67 on @xmath0 , such that @xmath68 where the kauffman bracket function is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "we will also need the following facts , that will be used hereafter without further mention .",

    ". moreover it can be proved that actually @xmath72 $ ] , so when one wants to evaluate the jones polynomial at a specific point , it is necessary to specify the value of @xmath73 , not just of @xmath14 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the jones polynomial of an oriented link is a laurent polynomial in @xmath14 if the number of components is odd , while it is the product of such a polynomial with @xmath74 otherwise .",
    "we are now ready to show that the writhe function is a homomorphism @xmath75 .",
    "similarly to @xcite , given @xmath76 , the associated oriented link @xmath77 may be decomposed in the two upper and lower halves , that is @xmath78 , hereafter called oriented _ semi - links_. we thus have @xmath79 .",
    "[ wr - hom - f ] for any @xmath80 , we have that @xmath81 .",
    "we begin recalling the procedure used by jones to endow the seifert surface associated to @xmath9 with a canonical orientation .",
    "each element of @xmath0 has associated @xmath5-graph that admits two @xmath4-colourings by the two colours @xmath82 . by convention",
    "we choose the colouring such that the first vertex on the left has colour @xmath83 .",
    "we consider the shading of a link diagram associated to @xmath64 ( as usual the outer region is white ) .",
    "the surface can then be obtained by gluing the shaded regions with suitably twisted strips .",
    "indeed any such region corresponds to a vertex of the @xmath5-graph , and its orientation is determined by the colour assigned to the vertex , namely counterclockwise if the colour is @xmath83 and clockwise in the other case .",
    "in particular , it follows that the orientation of the boundary strands of the upper semi - link is determined by the colouring via the rule @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , if we now consider @xmath86 and @xmath87 then @xmath88 and it is easy to see that @xmath89 where the negative sign of the summand in the last formula is due to the passage to the mirror image ( cf .",
    "2.4 ) ; notice that the different orientation of the semilinks @xmath90 and @xmath91 does not affect the writhe number ) .",

    "recall that the jones polynomial is invariant under a simultaneous change of orientation of all the components .",
    "thus we immediately get that @xmath104    [ wrzero ] the writhe function is identically zero on @xmath0 .    as @xmath105 , lemma [ shift ] and example [ ese - x0x1 ]",

    "so to obtain for @xmath271 the representative @xmath272 ( the last entry is defined mod @xmath38 ) .    to an element @xmath269 in @xmath3",
    "we can associate a signed graph @xmath273 as described in @xcite .",
    "this graph is obtained by glueing an upper graph @xmath274 and a lower graph @xmath275 ( independent of @xmath264 ) . as for @xmath2 , by adding an opposing pair of carets , the @xmath5-graph changes by inserting a new vertex only connected to a vertex of @xmath273 on its left by two parallel edges .    as usual , for any finite graph @xmath276 we consider the tutte polynomial @xmath277 in two variables @xcite .",
    "we can thus define the tutte function on the group @xmath3 by setting @xmath278 where @xmath279 have @xmath38 leaves and @xmath280 , cf .",

    "hence , @xmath288 and we need to show that the matrix @xmath289 is positive semi - definite . as in @xcite , it is enough to show that the matrix @xmath290 is positive semi - definite , where @xmath291 denotes the partition function of the potts model on the graph @xmath276 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the leaves of the trees @xmath292 come with a natural cyclic labelling by elements of @xmath293 induced by numbering the leaves of @xmath152 in increasing order ( recall that we join the first leaf of @xmath292 with the @xmath294 -th leaf of @xmath152 ) .",
    "the vertices of the associated graphs @xmath295 come with a natural labelling by elements of @xmath293 in increasing order .",
    "when computing the product @xmath296 , the associated @xmath297graph @xmath298 is obtained , up to a graph isomorphism induced by a cyclic permutation of the vertices , by glueing @xmath299 and @xmath300 ( this is a consequence of the rules for @xmath264 ) .    since the tutte polynomial / potts partition function is invariant under graph isomorphisms , it remains to show that the matrix @xmath301 is positive semi - definite . but @xmath302 for any @xmath303 , the expression @xmath304 defines the @xmath305th component of a vector @xmath306 in @xmath307 , @xmath287 and @xmath308 it follows that the matrix @xmath309 is positive semi - definite for any @xmath217 , i.e. the function @xmath281 is of positive type on @xmath3 .    as in @xcite",
    ", we define a kauffman bracket function on the thompson group @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that the kauffman bracket ( @xcite ) is defined by the following skein - relation @xmath310 we note that this polynomial is invariant under regular isotopies .",
    "since the addition of a pair of opposite carets yields a distant unknot , the kauffman bracket function is defined as @xmath311 where @xmath279 have @xmath38 leaves and @xmath312 .",
    "we recall some results proved in @xcite . given a signed graph @xmath276 .",
    "denote by @xmath313 and @xmath314 the subgraphs whose edges are the positive and the negative edges , respectively . for any @xmath315 ,",
    "define the function @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the spin at site @xmath225 .",
    "set @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "consider the partition function defined by @xmath320 where the sum over @xmath321 runs over all the spin configurations @xmath322 .    given a link @xmath54 with link diagram @xmath323 , we denote by @xmath324 its face graph ( for a definition see @xcite , p. 379 ) .",
    "then the following identity holds @xmath325 we also notice that , for any element in @xmath3 , the corresponding face graph and @xmath297graph coincide , namely @xmath326    [ pos - def - kauff ] the function @xmath327 , where @xmath13 is any solution of @xmath328 for @xmath329 , is of positive type on @xmath3 .",
    "as in the proof of theorem [ pos - def - tutte ] , without loss of generality we can suppose that @xmath330 where @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath152 have @xmath38 leaves and @xmath331 . therefore , it is enough to consider @xmath332 and , after neglecting a positive factor , prove that @xmath333 is positive semi - definite . we can use the partition function defined above in order to prove our claim , because of the identity ( [ kaufpartfun ] ) .",
    "again , it is possible to consider a family of graphs @xmath299 such that @xmath334 is ( graph ) isomorphic to @xmath335 .",
    "since the partition function depends only on the isomorphism class of the graph , we have that @xmath336 where , for each @xmath337 and any @xmath303 , the expression @xmath338 defines the @xmath305th component of a vector @xmath214 in @xmath307 , i.e. the component corresponding to @xmath339 .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath340 is positive definite for any @xmath217 , i.e. the function @xmath341 is of positive type .",
    "jones introduced the oriented version of the group @xmath3 , namely @xmath342 it is natural to ask whether some of the results proved for @xmath0 also hold for @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the writhe function @xmath343 extends to @xmath1 in the obvious way .",
    "first of all , we give a result similar to proposition [ wr - hom - f ] .    for any @xmath344 ,",
    "we have that @xmath81 .",
    "the difference with the procedure used for @xmath0 is that in this case one has to consider the graphs @xmath345 and @xmath346 , then rearrange the graph @xmath345 and eventually draw a link in the usual manner .",
    "we want to prove that for any rearrangement of the graph @xmath345 , the writhe of the semi - link is always the same .",
    "this follows from the following observations .",
    "first of all we recall that each crossing corresponds to an edge of the @xmath345 graph .",
    "the type of the ( oriented ) crossing depends on the colours chosen for the two vertices connected by the edge . consider an edge with left vertex coloured with @xmath83 and right vertex @xmath347 .",
    "then the corresponding crossing in the @xmath345 graph is @xmath146 .",
    "if in the new rearrangement the vertices have the same colours , then clearly the crossing is still positive .",
    "otherwise we obtain the crossing @xmath348{180}{$\\overcrossing$}}$ ] and thus we still have a positive crossing .",
    "now we have proved that the rearrangement does not effect the writhe and the main statement follows from an argument similar to the one used in the proof of proposition [ wr - hom - f ] .",
    "the writhe function is identically zero on @xmath1 .    in the proof of the above proposition",
    "it was shown that in the upper ( lower ) semi - link there are only crossings of positive ( negative ) type .",
    "this implies that the writhe of the link is zero .",
    "the proof of the following result is omitted since the argument is the same used in proposition [ lemma - comp - link - f ] .",
    "we have that @xmath349 on @xmath1 .",
    "now , basically by the same proofs as for @xmath0 , we obtain the following result .",
    "[ teo - fin - jones - t ] the evaluations of the function @xmath10 at @xmath171 are of positive type on @xmath1 .    as in @xcite , it is possible to define the colouring function @xmath350 on @xmath1 . the above theorem and the fact that @xmath351 then show that @xmath352 is a function of positive type on @xmath1 .",
