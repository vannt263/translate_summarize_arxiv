    "resonance formation in two - photon interactions offers a clean environment to study the spectrum of mesonic states . in this paper",
    "we study the reaction @xmath5 in untagged two - photon collisions where the outgoing electron and positron carry almost the full beam energy and are not detected .",
    "the data used for this analysis were collected with the l3 detector @xcite at lep at centre - of - mass energies , @xmath6 , between 183   and 209  , corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 664.6  .",
    "the tpc / two - gamma and mark  ii collaborations observed the axial vector meson ( @xmath7 ) in single - tag events  @xcite .",
    "we previously reported an indication of the formation of in untagged events at lep  @xcite .",
    "the decay into @xmath8 is dominated by the two - body decay @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the world average for the fraction @xmath4 is @xmath10  @xcite , although some experiments observed only the @xmath11 channel  @xcite .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the formation of is studied as a function of the transverse momentum squared of the system , .",
    "to a good approximation , @xmath12 where 2 is the maximum virtuality of the two photons .",
    "production of a spin - one resonance is suppressed for real photons , according to the landau - yang theorem  @xcite .",
    "an axial vector state can be produced in collisions of transverse - scalar virtual photons as well as of transverse - transverse photons , when one of them is highly virtual  @xcite .",
    "the -coupling parameter is defined as  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is mass of the resonance and @xmath15 is the partial width for the transverse - scalar photon - photon interaction .",
    "the cross section for the formation of an axial vector meson in two - photon collisions is described  @xcite by :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the two - photon effective mass and @xmath18 is an effective form factor .",
    "the 2 dependence of the resonance formation can be derived  @xcite using a hard scattering approach  @xcite and the form factor written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a parameter whose value is expected to be close to the resonance mass  @xcite .",
    "previous analyses  @xcite used the form  @xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mass of the @xmath23-meson .",
    "the last factor is the @xmath23  pole in the vector dominance model ( vdm ) .",
    "the second factor of equations ( [ eq : ffschuler ] ) and ( [ eq : ffcahn ] ) includes the contributions from transverse - scalar and transverse - transverse photons respectively .",
    "both models are compared to our data .",
    "two monte carlo generators are used to describe two - photon resonance formation : egpc  @xcite and gagares  @xcite .",
    "the egpc monte carlo describes the two - photon process as the product of the luminosity function for transverse photons @xcite and the resonance production cross section .",
    "the decay of the resonance is generated according to lorentz invariant phase - space .",
    "a monte carlo sample of the meson is generated with @xmath24 and full width @xmath25  @xcite , for @xmath26 .",
    "the events are passed through the l3 detector simulation based on the geant  @xcite and geisha  @xcite programs .",
    "time dependent detector inefficiencies , as monitored during the data taking period , are also simulated .",
    "this sample is used to obtain the selection efficiency .",
    "the gagares generator uses the exact matrix element for resonance production , @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it describes the 2 dependence of axial vector meson production , according to the form factor  ( [ eq : ffschuler ] ) , and is used for comparison with the experimental cross section .",
    "the 2 distribution does not depend on @xmath6 for the energy range investigated .",
    "events from the process @xmath28 , where only the decay @xmath29 is considered , are selected by requiring two particles of opposite charge and two photons , since the scattered electrons go undetected at very small polar angles .",
    "a charged particle is defined as a track in the central detector with at least 12 hits , coming from the interaction vertex within three standard deviations both in the transverse plane and along the beam axis .",
    "the pions are identified by the @xmath30 measurement , requiring a confidence level greater than  1% .",
    "a photon is defined as a cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter of energy greater than 0.1   and with no track around 0.2  rad from its direction .",
    "photons in the polar angular range @xmath31 are considered .",
    "the most energetic of the two photons must have energy greater than 0.24  .",
    "a clear @xmath32 signal is seen in the two - photon effective mass spectrum , figure  [ fig : etamass ] , where @xmath33 candidates are defined by the cut ( 0.47@xmath340.62 )  .",
    "the asymmetry of the two limits relative to the @xmath33 mass , @xmath35  @xcite , is due to a low energy tail of photon energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter . to improve the mass resolution , a kinematic fit , constrained to the @xmath33 mass ,",
    "is then applied .",
    "the selection results in 11254 events with a mass below 2  .",
    "the @xmath36 mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : e2pi ] and presents a clear peak of the @xmath37 resonance near threshold and a peak between 1.25   and 1.35  , which we associate with the meson .",
    "to study the formation of the @xmath38 meson , the data are subdivided into four intervals , as shown in figure  [ fig : f1bins ] and listed in table  [ tab : ptbins ] .",
    "each spectrum is fitted with a resonance plus a background function .",
    "the resonance is described by the convolution of a breit - wigner of width @xmath25  @xcite , with a gaussian resolution function of width 0.018  , estimated with monte carlo .",
    "the background is a second order polynomial .",
    "the fit results are listed in table  [ tab : ptbins ] , the mass values obtained in the four intervals are compatible within statistics with the mass of , @xmath39  @xcite .    besides the peak , figures  [ fig : f1bins]b@xmath34d present a structure at masses between 1.4   and 1.5  .",
    "this structure has variable mass and shape in these intervals and almost disappears in the total spectrum for @xmath40 , shown in figure  [ fig : a0f1]a .",
    "previously , the was observed in this mass region , but only in the final state , decaying dominantly into  @xcite .",
    "a similar fluctuation in the final state in the @xmath41 wave was also reported  @xcite and interpreted as an interference effect with , decaying to @xmath11 .",
    "this structure is not considered further in this letter .",
    "the partial cross sections @xmath42 for each range are calculated according to : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of events corresponding to the peak , the overall efficiency , @xmath45 , is the product of the selection efficiency , obtained from monte carlo , and the trigger efficiency , evaluated using data .",
    "@xmath46 is the total integrated luminosity .",
    "the trigger efficiency varies from 46% to 40% in the range from 0.02 to @xmath47 .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath48 includes @xmath49  @xcite , @xmath50  @xcite and the isospin factor @xmath51 .",
    "table  [ tab : ptbins ] lists the values of @xmath45 and @xmath42 .",
    "the overall efficiency is found to be independent of @xmath6 .",
    "systematic uncertainties on @xmath42 are presented in table  [ tab : syst ] .",
    "they include the uncertainty due to monte carlo statistics and trigger behaviour , the uncertainty due to background subtraction , estimated with variation of the fit ranges and the uncertainty from event selection .",
    "the last is estimated by varying the @xmath33 mass range and the energy threshold for the most energetic photon .",
    "the experimental differential cross section of production as a function of 2 is presented in figure  [ fig : gagarf1 ] and compared to the gagares monte carlo prediction .",
    "first , the mass parameter @xmath20 in the form factor of equation  ( [ eq : ffschuler ] ) is fixed to the resonance mass , @xmath24 . normalising the monte carlo histogram to the experimental cross section in the measured interval @xmath52 , a confidence level of 2%",
    "a fit of the gagares prediction is then performed , where @xmath20 and are free parameters .",
    "it gives : @xmath53 @xmath54 with a confidence level of 91% and correlation coefficient @xmath340.89 .",
    "the first uncertainty quoted is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "the uncertainty on includes the uncertainty on @xmath55 .    by using the fitted values of @xmath20 and ,",
    "we extrapolate the measured cross section to the full range with gagares , obtaining the value : @xmath56 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "this value refers to a luminosity averaged @xmath6 of @xmath57 .",
    "we also compare the experimental results to the predictions , obtained with the formalism of reference  , using the form factor defined in equation  ( [ eq : ffcahn ] ) . normalising the prediction to the experimental cross section",
    ", a confidence level below @xmath58 is found .",
    "the incompatibility of the differential cross section shapes is evident in figure  [ fig : gagarf1 ] .      to search for the decay @xmath9 we select only data with @xmath59 .",
    "the corresponding mass spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : a0f1]a . in figure",
    "[ fig : a0f1]b , both @xmath60 mass combinations are plotted versus the mass .",
    "an accumulation of events with @xmath60 mass around 0.98   is observed correlated with the .",
    "the @xmath61 signal is evident in figure  [ fig : a0f1]c , where the mass region is selected , @xmath62 .",
    "no signal is observed in the sideband regions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , figure  [ fig : a0f1]d . in order to evaluate the @xmath11 contribution to the signal",
    ", the @xmath60 spectrum is fitted with a resonance plus a background function as shown in figure  [ fig : a0f1]c .",
    "the resonance is the convolution of a breit - wigner with a gaussian resolution with width 0.014  , estimated from monte carlo .",
    "the background function is obtained from the sidebands of figure  [ fig : a0f1]d .",
    "the fit gives @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 events .",
    "the fitted mass is in good agreement with the world average @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are obtained from the variation of the and sideband mass limits and from variation of the cut .",
    "a fit to the corresponding mass spectrum of figure  [ fig : a0f1]a gives @xmath69 events in the peak , where the systematic uncertainty is due to background subtraction .",
    "thus the observed number of events is compatible with 100% decay into @xmath11 .",
    "taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties , the measured branching fraction @xmath4 is found to be greater than 0.69 at 95% confidence level .",
