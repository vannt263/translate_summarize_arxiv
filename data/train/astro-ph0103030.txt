    "muons detected at ground level arise mainly as decay products of charged mesons .",
    "these mesons are created abundantly in hadronic showers , most of which are caused by primary cosmic ray protons and nuclei interacting inelastically with the nuclei of the atmosphere . a small fraction of muons , however , have their first origin in photonuclear reactions induced by primary or secondary cosmic gamma rays .",
    "several authors have performed analytical or monte carlo calculations of the muon flux produced in gamma showers ( see references [ 10 - 21 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "most of these calculations were one dimensional and all of them referred to gamma energies much larger than 10 tev .    despite their relative scarcity compared to the large background of muons from hadron - generated showers , muons originating from primary gamma ray interactions are important for ground - based high statistics cosmic ray experiments which are sensitive to energies @xmath0  tev such as milagro  @xcite and grand  @xcite .",
    "cosmic gamma rays , unlike charged hadrons , are unaffected by the earth s and galactic magnetic fields and their direction points directly to the location of their source .",
    "therefore , an accumulation of muon directions around a particular angle ( and also at a particular time in the case of pulsed sources or gamma ray bursts ) carries direct information about the location of the source and the neutrality of the primary causing the excess .",
    "the ability to distinguish these muons from background muons depends upon statistics , the strength and energy spectrum of the emitting source , the angular resolution of the experiment , and the degradation of the angular resolution due to all the physical processes which occur between the primary and the muon at detection level .",
    "this last point is the focus of this calculation .",
    "knowledge of this angular resolution is important in order to determine a detection window which is large enough to include a good fraction of the gamma signal and , at the same time , small enough to minimize the large uniform background of hadronic origin .",
    "the information about the primary gamma direction is degraded by multiple physical processes so the final measured direction of the muon is no longer collinear with the primary which originated the muon s ancestors . in particular ,",
    "the direction resolution is affected by the angle of production of the mesons in the primary interaction ( and then in subsequent hadronic interactions of these mesons to create additional mesons ) , the decay angle of the muon relative to its parent meson , and the lengths of the charged particle paths including that of the detected muon at ground level . along these path lengths",
    "there is coulomb scattering and deflection in the earth s magnetic field for the trajectories of the mesons and the muon ( usually most important for the muon which typically has the longest flight path and the lowest momentum . )",
    "in addition , these effects depend upon the energy of the particles involved and on the varying properties of the atmosphere ( pressure , temperature . )",
    "the muons are produced by mesons of second , third , or further generations .",
    "the number of generations typically increases with increasing primary gamma energy and each new generation involves an additional production angle which tends to increase the angular disparity between muon and primary because of more steps in a random walk type process .",
    "an opposing effect at higher energies is that all angular distributions are more forward - peaked thus decreasing the angular disparity ; the resulting effect is a combination of the two .    the purpose of the present study is to estimate the influence of the various effects on the ultimate angular resolution which can be obtained utilizing ground level muons .",
    "the complexity of the problem requires detailed analyses which can only be obtained by a full three - dimensional monte carlo ( mc ) calculation .",
    "in addition , since only a small fraction of all primary photons gives rise to an event of interest , it is desirable to resort to statistical variance reduction techniques to bring the computing task within manageable limits .",
    "the monte carlo program fluka  @xcite provides an accurate and well - tested description of the hadronic and electromagnetic interactions with all the relevant physical effects , and a set of effective statistical tools to accelerate convergence of the results .",
    "the program has been used to calculate the geometrical properties of secondary muons at sea level arising from primary gamma cosmic rays with energies from 1  gev to 10  tev interacting in the earth s atmosphere . in this energy range",
    "the cross section for direct muon pair production is much smaller than that for hadroproduction and has been neglected .",
    "this range has been shown in  @xcite to be the interval which produces the maximum secondary muon flux at ground level for primary differential gamma spectra with spectral indices larger than 2.4 ( a smaller index would yield a harder spectrum and give a maximum secondary muon flux arising from primary energies beyond those considered here . )    in this paper , only incident cosmic gamma rays at perpendicular ( vertical ) incidence on top of the atmosphere are considered .",
    "ground - based experiments often choose angles close to normal for reasons of simplicity and because the detection rate is a maximum , the rate dropping rather rapidly as the angle deviates markedly from normal . for small angles from normal",
    ", the angular resolution results will probably not differ significantly from those presented in this paper .",
    "in addition to the angular correlation of secondary muons at ground level , this study provides also additional information such as the distribution of heights at which the muons originate , the muon s kinetic energy distribution at the ground and production level , the radial distribution of the muons , and the number of generations which preceded that of the muon .",
    "the 2000 version of the fluka monte carlo code was used to simulate the electromagnetic and hadronic particle cascades induced by primary gamma rays in the atmosphere .",
    "the powerful biasing capabilities of the code allowed a simulation of the full three - dimensional shower in a single run from the top of the atmosphere down to ground level .",
    "the physical models implemented in fluka which are relevant for the present study as well as various variance reduction techniques were already discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there it was emphasized that these models were validated by comprehensive comparisons of fluka results with experimental data obtained mostly at accelerators but also in recent cosmic ray studies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the simulation of an atmospheric shower and , in particular , of its muon component is a relatively new area of application of fluka .",
    "additional examples showing that the code allows remarkably accurate predictions in this area are given in section  [ fluka-datcmp.subsec ] .",
    "section  [ fluka-simdet.subsec ] contains some details of the present gamma ray shower simulations which supplement those discussed in  @xcite ; this reference contains a more complete description .",
    "no data exist for the muon component of gamma ray - induced showers to which fluka results could be directly compared . on the other hand , data on muon flux and",
    "energy spectra have become available recently for atmospheric showers induced by cosmic ray protons and nuclei .",
    "these data were mostly obtained with spectrometers in balloon - borne experiments and cover the whole range of atmospheric depths from the top of the atmosphere down to sea level .",
    "fortunately , the mechanisms and models for muon production and transport in gamma ray - induced showers are largely the same as those in pure hadronic air showers . in both cases ,",
    "the production of the pions which eventually decay into muons is described by the dual parton model ( dpm )  @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that in the former case the photon is assumed to fluctuate first into a quark - antiquark state which then interacts hadronically , identical to a meson .",
    "this so - called vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) for the hadronic photon fluctuation is a well - established concept ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and its application together with the dpm to hadronic interactions of photons has been proven to be very successful ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a good description of muon production from proton- and nuclei - induced air showers should therefore give confidence that the corresponding results obtained with fluka for photon - induced air showers are reliable as well .",
    "in the following a few examples are given .",
    "a critical aspect of muon production in the atmosphere is the dependence of the total muon flux on the height above sea level .",
    "this dependence is commonly expressed as a function of depth in the atmosphere ( in g/@xmath1 of air ) which is a measure of the amount of air penetrated by the cascade .",
    "it has been measured by the caprice experiment which was able to distinguish between positively and negatively charged muons .",
    "results obtained with fluka for negative muons are compared with caprice data  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ mu - capdep ] .",
    "the different curves correspond to the muon flux calculated for different intervals of the muon momentum .",
    "to correspond to the average geometrical response of the caprice apparatus , only muons with a polar angle of less than @xmath2 with respect to the vertical ( i.e. , vertical muons ) were scored .",
    "the simulations are based on sophisticated models and methods for the sampling of the identity , energy , and angle of the hadronic primary from the distributions of galactic cosmic rays on top of the atmosphere at the time of the measurements .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite . as can be seen from the figure",
    ", fluka gives a good description of the negative muon flux for all depths .",
    "similar agreement exists for positive muons ( not shown here ) .",
    "energy spectra of muons were recorded by the same experiment at ground ( i.e. , at an atmospheric depth of 886  g/@xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "fluka results for positive and negative muons are compared to these data in fig .",
    "[ mu - capspc25&ratio]a .",

    "[ mu - capspc25&ratio]b . data and calculations are again for vertical muons at a depth of 886  g/@xmath1 .",
    "the ratios are plotted as a function of the muon energy .",
    "the above comparisons of fluka results and experimental data together with those published in earlier studies  @xcite indicate that the application of fluka to cosmic gamma ray showers should give reliable predictions as well .      in order to study the dependence of the shower properties on the primary photon energy , the showers were calculated for monoenergetic photons impinging vertically on top of the atmosphere ( taken to be 80  km above sea level ) . in total 9 sets of simulations",
    "were performed for the following primary energies : 1 , 3 , 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 , 3000 , and 10000  gev . as in the earlier study  @xcite the atmosphere",
    "was approximated by 50 layers with a constant density in each layer and with layer - densities decreasing exponentially with increasing altitude .",
    "it has been verified  @xcite that this approximation does not affect the conclusions drawn in this study .",
    "the geometry is described in a right - handed orthogonal system with its origin at the intersection of the shower axis with sea - level elevation , @xmath3 points to the center of the earth and @xmath4 and @xmath5 point north and east , respectively .",
    "most of the results discussed throughout the paper were obtained without the effect of the magnetic field of the earth included . however , for two primary energies ( 10  gev and 1  tev ) additional simulations were performed which included the magnetic field of three different geographical locations ( see sec .",
    "[ angular-magfld.subsec ] ) .",
    "the use of several variance reduction ( biasing ) techniques was essential to obtain results with reasonable statistical significance .",
    "they included leading particle biasing at each electromagnetic interaction , biasing of the photon mean - free - path with respect to photonuclear interactions , biasing of the decay length of charged mesons , and particle splitting at the boundaries of different air layers .",
    "each of these biasing techniques alters the statistical weight of a particle in the cascade .",
    "a muon as produced and transported in the monte carlo simulation and which carries a certain statistical weight ( hereafter called `` mc muon '' ) contributes to distributions , yields , etc .",
    ", of actual , i.e. , measurable muons with a probability equal to its weight .",
    "the use of biasing techniques would not be appropriate to study fluctuations within the same shower which , however , is not the aim of this study .",

    "in addition , the corresponding values from the calculations without the effect of the magnetic field are given .",
    "the widths in the north - down plane are much less affected than in the east - down plane which contains the dominant effect of the magnetic deflection .",
    "this effect increases with increasing values of @xmath62 or decreasing values of muon momentum .",
    "in addition to the widths of the muon s sea level angular distributions , table  [ angwidthsmag.tab ] also shows the values at their production vertex ( birth , e - d.(b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , these values are almost constant for the different field conditions .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the angular distributions is therefore mainly the deflection of the muon over its longer path and not the deflection of the parent pions or other charged particles preceding in the cascade due to their shorter path lengths and higher momenta as compared to the muons .",
    "in addition , the dominant factor in the final width ( except for the highest magnetic field value ) is the muon s angular distribution at its production ( birth ) point .",
    "air pressure and temperature changes cause small variations in the density profile of the atmosphere and thus affect the muon flux at sea level . in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of these two effects ,",
    "the following cases were studied : ( i ) the air density in each layer was increased by 3% while all other variables ( geometry , cutoffs , etc . )",
    "were kept constant and ( ii ) the height above sea level of each slab boundary was raised by 5% and the corresponding density decreased in the same proportion such that the total thickness of air ( in g/@xmath1 ) above the surface of the earth remained constant .",
    "the former modification simulates an air pressure increase ( @xmath63 ) whereas the latter simulates an overall 5% increase in absolute temperature ( @xmath64 ) of the atmosphere .",
    "since muons are produced at atmospheric heights far above those which determine the weather at the surface of the earth , the mean @xmath64 which is involved in this calculation has little correlation with the temperature at the earth s surface .",
    "thus the temperature effect calculated here is not expected to correlate with the earth s surface temperature but would require temperature measurements of the earth s atmosphere averaged from 0 to 20  km above the earth s surface as obtained , for example , in weather balloon measurements .",
    "the results presented in this section allow an investigation of , or corrections for , the muon flux due to small variations in the atmospheric pressure and height - averaged temperature .",

    "a higher density increases the interaction probability of the pions and thus decreases the probability of decay , i.e. , fewer muons are produced .",
    "as well , the added thickness of air which the muons must traverse is a barrier which some will fail to overcome . on the other hand , raising the boundaries of the layers and reducing their density causes two counterbalancing effects : ( i ) the pions propagate in a less dense medium and thus have a greater probability to decay rather than interact thus producing more muons , and ( ii ) the muons must propagate longer distances resulting in a greater probability that they will decay before reaching ground level .",
    "the calculated temperature dependence of the muon multiplicity ratio suggests that the enhanced muon decay probability dominates at these energies and is the more dominant at the lower energy .",

    "this asymmetry can be explained by the different interaction cross sections at low energy of pions of either charge and by the fact that these pions are mainly produced in secondary interactions of neutrons ( see below ) .",

    "contributes significantly to the production of the parent .",
    "these secondary hadrons are mainly of third or fourth generation and cause a shift of the peak of the total distribution at tev energies .",
    "the large tail at these energies which extends up to more than 100 generations reflects photoproduction processes of secondary photons in the large electromagnetic shower .",
    "the distributions of heights above sea level at which the detected muons were produced are shown for four primary energies in fig .",
    "as expected , at high energy there is a decrease in height with increasing energy of the primary gamma ray because of the logarithmic increase of the shower length .",
    "however , as the energy of the primary gamma ray decreases below 10  gev , the energy of the muon parent is close to the minimum energy required for the muon to penetrate the blanket of air between its production and sea level .",
    "hence , the most probable height of muon production begins to decrease with energies decreasing below 10  gev .",
    "the blip - up near zero height , most pronounced in the 3 and 10  gev distributions , represents the excess contribution from very low energy muons .      the radial distributions of the muons at their production vertices and at sea level",

    "this discontinuity indicates that two components with different shapes contribute . in order to further investigate this feature",
    "the muon production vertices were scored separately for those muons which originated from mesons produced in photoproduction processes and those from mesons produced by interactions of nucleons or other hadrons .",
    "the contributions from these components are shown for a primary energy of 10  gev in fig .",
    "[ dnda10gev ] . as can be clearly seen in the production vertex distributions ( fig .",
    "[ dnda10gev]a ) the photoproduction component dominates at small radii and the component due to interacting nucleons constitutes the tail at large @xmath101 .",
    "the difference is smaller at sea level ( fig .",

    "the kinetic energy distributions of muons at sea level and at the production vertex of these muons are shown in fig .",
    "[ dndekin ] .",
    "note , that the distributions are multiplied by the muon energy @xmath104 in order to enhance possible spectral structures at the higher energies .",
    "whereas the sea level spectra are a smooth function with energy , the distributions of the muon energies at their birth exhibit a two - component structure .",
    "this two - component structure is again due to the superposition of muons from mesons generated in photoproduction processes and those from interacting hadrons .",
    "the two contributions are plotted separately in fig .",
    "[ dndekin10gev ] for 10  gev primary photon energy .",
    "it is clear that muons from photoproduction processes have a higher average energy .",
    "air showers caused by cosmic gamma rays with energies below 10  tev were simulated using the monte carlo code fluka .",
    "the primary gamma rays were assumed to enter the atmosphere vertically .",
    "the reliability of fluka predictions in this energy region was explored by comparing its predictions for proton- and nuclei - induced air showers with experimental data ; good agreement was found .",
    "many general properties of muon production in atmospheric gamma ray showers were studied . as expected , most of the muons which reach sea level are decay products of charged pions ; the contribution from kaons increases as the primary energy increases .",
    "below 100  gev primary energy , the decaying mesons are produced mainly in photoproduction processes . at higher energies , hadronic interactions of nucleons and pions",
    "contribute significantly .",
    "variations in atmospheric pressure and temperature were investigated : a 3.0% increase in atmospheric pressure decreases the muon yield at sea level by 4.0% for 10  gev primaries ( 3.2% at 1  tev ) .",
    "similarly , a 5.0% increase in the height - averaged temperature decreases the muon yield by 6.0% ( 3.6% at 1  tev ) .",
    "the main goal of the study was to determine the angular resolution for primary cosmic gamma rays from measurements of secondary muon angles at ground level .",
    "the angular distribution of muons at sea level narrows as the muon energy increases since low energy muons constitute the tails of the angular distributions .",
    "thus , the angular resolution can be improved by eliminating the lower energy muons .",
    "the half - widths at half - maximum - height of the muon s projected angles are @xmath105 above 100  gev but rise to a value of @xmath106 as the primary gamma ray energy is lowered to 10  gev in the absence of the earth s magnetic field deflection .",
    "primary energies below 10  gev essentially do not contribute muons at ground level .",
    "the effects of magnetic bending were considered separately as they depend on several factors ; for example , they are more important in the east - down plane , for low primary energies , low muon energies , and larger north - components of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the width of the angular distribution can be narrowed if the correlation of @xmath21 ( angle projected onto the north - down plane ) with @xmath4 is taken into consideration ( assuming the location of the core of the shower is measured ) .",
    "this narrowing can be accomplished either by eliminating large @xmath4 and @xmath5 values from the data or by compensating the measured angles knowing their expected mean values versus @xmath4 and @xmath5 as calculated from fluka .",
    "finally , the average muon angular correlation was calculated for a spectrum of primary gamma rays characterized by a spectral index . for a soft spectrum , e.g. a differential spectral index @xmath107 , the average projected angular width ( hwhm ) is @xmath108 ; for a mean value , @xmath109 ,",
    "the width is @xmath110 .",
    "if the spectrum is harder , e.g. @xmath111 , the angular width improves to a constant value of @xmath112 .",
    "corresponding values for a space angle resolution ( @xmath36(hwhm ) ) are @xmath38 larger . as mentioned above , if data with larger @xmath4 and @xmath5 values and/or the lower muon energies are removed , this angular correlation can be improved .",
    "this precise calculation of the angular correlations provides experiments which study the angular location of primary gamma ray sources by measuring muon angles with information on the angular resolution which is difficult to obtain experimentally .",
