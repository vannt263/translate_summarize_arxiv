    "near- and mid - ir observations of young stars demonstrate that optically - thick circumstellar disks disappear around approximately half of low - mass young stars in 1 - 3 myr and are nearly entirely absent around members of 10 myr old associations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "accretion ceases on approximately the same timescale ( e.g. @xcite ) . the disappearance of gas and dust - planetary building material - places stringent limits on the timescales of giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "however , identifying exactly how dust and gas dissipate is complicated due to the difficulty in identifying objects clearly in the transition of losing their surrounding material .",
    "one of the most common methods , dating back to iras ( e.g. @xcite ) , of identifying candidate transitional systems between the classical and debris disk evolutionary stages is through mid - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "dust growth , sedimentation and removal is expected to result in a deficit of infrared flux as material is accreted or dispersed .",
    "this deficit has become the defining characteristic of transitional disks .",
    "for some disks , flux deficits are seen at all wavelengths , suggesting a gradual dissipation of mass for all disk radii .",
    "in other cases , a flux deficit is only seen at short wavelengths , indicating that the outer disk remains massive and optically thick while the inner disk lacks small dust grains .",
    "the presence of both types of transitional disks suggests that the transition happens via different paths from the gas - rich , optically - thick stage to gas - poor , optically - thin disks @xcite . the fraction of stars with transitional disks is thought to be 525% @xcite .",
    "the small numbers indicate that the evolutionary path through a transitional disk is either uncommon or rapid .",
    "however , a consensus in nomenclature is still lacking : even within a single cluster , the calculated fraction of transitional disks can range from 10 - 50 % , depending on definitions ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    transition disks with a short wavelength deficit are particularly interesting because they are potential tracers of planet formation .",
    "this deficit arises from the absence of hot small dust grains close to the star resulting in flux coming solely from the stellar photosphere , rather than disk surface emission .",
    "this deficit may be the result of grain growth and sedimentation but also of complex interactions between a nascent protoplanet and the surrounding disk .",
    "the flux deficit from such inner holes results in a depressed sed at wavelengths less than @xmath015 , while retaining typical fluxes at longer wavelengths from the outer disk .",
    "the short wavelength flux deficit arises from the absence of hot small dust grains close to the star resulting in flux coming solely from the stellar photosphere , rather than disk surface emission .",
    "we define such disks as `` cold disks '' to differentiate from other types of transitional systems ( e.g. anemic or homologously depleted , defined as disks with an overall lower mass at all radii ) and to emphasize that this is an observational characteristic not necessarily tied to evolution .",
    "seds , relying heavily on mid - ir spectroscopy , are the tool currently most widely used to infer the presence of holes and gaps ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter b07 ) . additional submillimeter observations of the most massive disks have directly imaged large holes @xcite .",
    "the hole sizes match reasonably well with estimates from sed modeling , suggesting that current interpretation and modeling of the seds is correct . within the category of cold disks ,",
    "significant differences are seen in hole sizes ( from 150 au ) , the presence or absence of gas and dust within the hole , and the presence or absence of accretion @xcite .",
    "detailed comparisons of these properties to the predictions of each of the scenarios listed above can help to discriminate which processes control the observed disk evolution .",
    "however , statistical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are limited by small sample sizes .",
    "_ spitzer _ mapping efforts should include a significant number of unidentified cold disks and other types of transitional disks .",
    "however , accurately identifying these cold disks out of the large numbers of stars present in the maps is difficult with just broad band photometry .",
    "reliable criteria for identifying disks with inner holes from _ spitzer _",
    "photometry , which lack any information on fluxes in the crucial region between 8 and 24 , are needed to generate a large sample for statistical purposes .",
    "this paper presents a new large sample of cold disks identified from ` cores to disks ' data @xcite and analyzes simultaneously follow - up observations of the sample with the irs and mips instruments together with optical spectroscopy and millimeter continuum observations .",

    "any possible optical veiling was not considered for the other objects in the sample . a more detailed description of our spectral typing and the stellar properties of all the serpens objects are presented by @xcite .",
    "literature values for spt are adopted for several objects that we did not observe and for several objects where the literature spt is more reliable than the spt from our spectra .",
    "spectral types are converted to @xmath12 using the scales in @xcite for objects earlier than m0 and @xcite for those later or equal to m0 , to account for the lower surface gravity atmosphers of mid m stars .",
    "the extinction and luminosity for each object were calculated using sed fits to broadband optical and near - ir photometry ( see table [ tab : phottable1 ] for photometry and   [ diskparameters ] for a discussion on the assumed extinction law ) .",
    "assumed distances are listed at the bottom of table [ tab : stellarparameters ] .",
    "nextgen models of stellar photospheres @xcite are used as templates for the broadband emission .",
    "the 2mass and any optical photometry are the primary constraints on extinction and stellar luminosity .",
    "for the 3 objects that lack optical spectra ( identified with a `` 2 '' in table [ tab : stellarparameters ] ) , the sed fits are also used to estimate spt . however , these spt estimates have large uncertainties because they are based on jhk colors , which are not very sensitive to spectral types from mid - k through m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stellar ages and masses are estimated by comparing the stellar luminosity and effective temperature to pre - main sequence tracks of @xcite for low - mass stars ( @xmath13 @xmath14 , mixing length = 1 ) and @xcite for higher - mass stars .",
    "since uncertainties in stellar age are large they are not tabulated here and we focus the analysis on the better constrained stellar masses .      in the process of determining the stellar properties , it became clear that a fraction of the sample sources were actually edge - on disks .",
    "inferring disk structure from an sed analysis is difficult when the disk is viewed edge - on and occults the star . in these cases ,",
    "optical and near - ir light from the star and inner disk are only seen in reflected emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of such emission depends on the precise viewing angle and the disk flaring , but is always much fainter than it would be if the disk were viewed without the large absorption column from the edge - on disk .",
    "emission from outflows , seen prominently in optical forbidden lines , are not occulted by the disk and can therefore have large equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "based on the existing data on our sources , we establish four criteria to determine whether a disk is viewed edge - on : ( 1 ) a low ratio of photospheric luminosity to main - sequence luminosity , assessed at @xmath15 myr from baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; ( 2 ) large equivalent widths in optical forbidden lines ; ( 3 ) strong silicate and/or ice absorption in the irs spectra ; and ( 4 ) high infrared luminosity compared to stellar luminosity .",
    "any one of these criteria can be degenerate between edge - on disks and other explanations , due to potential errors in distance and extinctions and the absence of accretion / outflow activity .",
    "however , the presence of at least two of these four criteria should establish in most cases that the disk is edge - on .",
    "eight of the sources were selected as edge - on disks and the reasons are marked in table [ tab : edgeon ] .",
    "no further analysis was done on these disks as the stellar properties are too uncertain .",
    "the presence or absence of accretion can be assessed from the strength and shape of emission in several optical lines , most prominently h@xmath16 .",
    "though some h@xmath16 emission is produced in chromospheres of late - type stars , accretion typically generates h@xmath16 emission with much larger equivalent widths and broader spectral profiles ( see @xcite for a comprehensive description of accretion phenomenology and diagnostics ) .",
    "a 10 cutoff in equivalent width has historically been used to identify accretion , though this rough cutoff depends on spectral type ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the h@xmath16 10% width ( defined as the full width of the h@xmath16 line at 10% of the peak flux ) has been used to discriminate between accretors and non - accretors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "accretion / outflow activity can also produce asymmetries and absorption components within the line profile ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and variable line fluxes and shapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for any such criteria , a small accretion rate relative to the stellar luminosity is not detectable .    to classify the accretion properties of stars in our optical sample ,",
    "a gaussian profile is fit to the h@xmath16 line .",
    "we then measure the equivalent width and , when possible , the h@xmath16 10% width from the gaussian profile , after accounting for the resolution of each observation ( see a more complete discussion of this method in @xcite ) .",
    "uncertainties in h@xmath16 10% widths range from 50150 kms@xmath17 .",
    "the h@xmath16 equivalent width and 10% width are then used together with the spectral type to assess whether accretion is ongoing , adhering to the loose guidelines suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "typically , a star is classified an accretor if the h@xmath16 10% width is @xmath18 kms@xmath17and the h@xmath16 equivalent width is @xmath19   for an early k star , @xmath20   for late k star and @xmath21   for an m star .",
    "we classify 21 stars in our sample as accretors and 8 stars as non - accretors , with 6 cases lacking information . in many cases",
    "an object is clearly accreting .",
    "as explained below , some classifications are ambiguous both because some accretors and non - accretors have similar h@xmath16 10% and equivalent widths and because the uncertainties in h@xmath16 10% width are large .",
    "objects 23 and 24 have weak h@xmath16 equivalent widths but broad h@xmath16 line shapes .",
    "such observations could be explained if accretion is present with strong absorption , either from outflows or the accretion flow itself , that suppresses the h@xmath16 emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , if the star is an unresolved binary with only one accreting component , or if the stars are chromospherically active with large @xmath22 sin @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the highest - resolution spectrum of object 24 shows absorption in h@xmath16 , while two of the three show [ ] in emission .",
    "this star is therefore classified as an accretor .",
    "on the other hand , object 23 shows no other evidence of accretion and is classified as a non - accretor .",
    "object 18 is left unclassified because the h@xmath16 equivalent width is ambiguous between accretion and non - accretion .",
    "the h@xmath16 emission from doar 21 ( object 25 ) has varied on long timescales , but with no definitive evidence for accretion @xcite .",
    "temporal variations in h@xmath16 also introduce uncertainty in classifying the presence or absence of accretion .",
    "a mass - dependent bias likely exists in this classification scheme because the stronger photospheric continuum emission and spectral type degeneracy for stars with early spectral types can mask h@xmath16 emission produced by weak - to - moderate accretion onto the star .",
    "based on these uncertainties , we suspect a small number of objects in our sample ( estimated at @xmath2410% ) might be misclassified as accretors or non - accretors .    to quantify accretion , we convert the h@xmath16 10% widths to accretion rate using the relationship derived by @xcite .",
    "methodological differences in measuring the h@xmath16 10% width between this work and @xcite likely leads to an order - of - magnitude uncertainty in the listed accretion rates . for late - k and early m - dwarfs , which comprise the bulk of our sample ,",
    "the h@xmath16 10% width is not sensitive to accretion rates @xmath25 @xmath14 yr@xmath17 . for earlier spectral types , the sensitivity worsens to larger accretion rates .",
    "table [ tab : stellarparameters ] gives the h@xmath16 equivalent widths , 10 % widths and mass accretion rates derived from this work and table [ tab : sampleclass ] gives the final classification of each source .",
    "millimeter continuum fluxes can be used to calculate disk masses assuming that the millimeter emission is optically thin and a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the disk masses can then be used in turn to constrain sed models .",
    "the disk masses , @xmath26 , are calculated following @xcite and with standard assumptions and parameters . in the rayleigh - jeans limit ,",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 is the flux at frequency @xmath29 , here 230 ghz , @xmath30 is the distance to the star ( see table [ tab : stellarparameters ] ) , @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32 is the opacity .",
    "it is assumed that the emission arises primarily from an approximately isothermal region with temperature , @xmath24@xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "average disk temperatures in the outer disk range from 10 to 50 k and here we have used 30 k. one of the major uncertainties is the opacity , @xmath32 . we follow @xcite and adopt @xmath35 = 0.02 @xmath36g@xmath17 anchored at @xmath37 = 230 ghz , the frequency of our observations .",
    "disk masses are listed in table [ tab : diskparams ] for the ten detected sources and the seven with upper limits . the majority ( 80% ) of the disks in our sample",
    "have disk masses of less than 2 @xmath38 10@xmath39 m@xmath40 and the sample has an average @xmath26 of 4.5@xmath41 m@xmath40 .",
    "these are relatively low mass disks compared to many millimeter studies , such as the large sample of t tauri disks in @xcite which have an average mass of 10@xmath42 m@xmath40 using the same assumptions .      in order to determine the presence or absence of a hole ,",
    "the full sed is needed to determine the disk structure .",
    "the seds for the stars in the sample are organized by type with edge - on disks ( figure [ seds_figure_edgeon ] ) , disks with holes ( figure [ seds_figure_holes ] and [ seds_figure_holes2 ] ) , and disks without holes ( figure [ seds_figure_noholes ] ) . the solid dots are dereddened fluxes , which contains the 2mass jhk fluxes , the 4 irac fluxes from 3.6 to 8 @xmath1 m and the mips fluxes at 24 and 70 @xmath1 m for all sources , plus optical or 1.3 mm fluxes for a smaller subsample of the objects .",
    "in some cases , 70 photometry produced only upper limits , often accompanied by non - detections at 1.3 mm , and thus severely limits information about the outer disk .",
    "the solid dots are the dereddened fluxes , the solid line is the irs spectrum binned at a resolution of 1 , the grey dotted line is the stellar kurucz model of the central star . the differences between the kurucz and the nextgen stellar models used above are negligible for the purposes of disk characterization .",
    "the data were dereddened using the @xmath43 values listed in table [ tab : stellarparameters ] and the extinction law by @xcite with @xmath44=5.5 .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have suggested that this larger value of @xmath44 is more suitable for star forming clouds than the typical value of @xmath44=3.1 , which is based on models and observations of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the higher @xmath44 value reflects larger maximum dust grain sizes and results in stronger dereddening effects throughout the mid - ir .",
    "dereddened fluxes are 2 - 4 times higher at 24 and @xmath4510 than with @xmath44=3.1 .",
    "however , observational measures of extinction indicate that the large amount of reddening is in agreement with observations and may even underestimate the actual effect in star forming regions ( @xcite )",
    ".    as the extinction law is not flat throughout the mid - ir , errors in the mid - ir extinction law could potentially artificially create or remove sed deficits mimicking inner holes .",
    "corrections are much smaller at low @xmath46 , so effects only become significant for @xmath47 10 . based on observations , the extinction law used here",
    "is conservative with some cold disks being potentially missed due to inadequate dereddening around 20 . with such large grain sizes in the absorbing dust , silicate",
    "grain opacities are expected to have strong effects on the 10 silicate feature . in a few dereddened seds ,",
    "strong silicate features are seen which are not present in the uncorrected spectra .",
    "the effects of extinction on the silicate features are complex and dependent on extinction and line - of - sight ice and dust composition , which may not be uniform throughout star forming regions @xcite . due to this uncertainty",
    ", all work on the silicate feature in this paper has been done on spectra which have not been dereddened , with the caveat that sources with high @xmath46 have large errors ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the 2-d radiative transfer model radmc @xcite , as modified to include a density reduction simulating a hole , was used to model the seds .",
    "the model has a large number of input parameters and we have fixed as many as possible .",
    "the model assumes a passive disk , which merely reprocesses the stellar radiation field and does not account for accretion luminosity and heating .",
    "this is justified since the disk to stellar luminosity ratios of the majority of the disks in this study are below 0.4 ( see table [ tab : diskparams ] ) .",
    "further discussion on the disk model dependency of the results can be found in   [ colddiskproperties ] .",
    "stellar input parameters are mass , temperature and luminosity which were determined from optical spectroscopy and photospheric sed fits ( see table [ tab : stellarparameters ] ) . a stellar kurucz model is then used for the stellar radiation field . in terms of disk structure ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be flared such that the surface height , @xmath48 , varies with radius , @xmath49 , as @xmath50 , as in @xcite .",
    "the models do not calculate the hydrostatic equilibrium self - consistently allowing the dust distribution to differ from the gas distribution ( expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium ) due to effects such as dust settling .",
    "the pressure scale height is anchored at the outer disk edge , in this case 200 au . in some cases",
    ", some degree of settling appears to have taken place .",
    "we present this number as a fraction of the scale height predicted from hydrostatic equilibrium , assuming a midplane temperature of 20 k. in cases where the disk has settled , a flaring index of 2/7 ( 0.29 ) is likely too large ( see e.g. @xcite where flaring indices range from 0.04 to 0.26 ) .",
    "disk model seds with large flaring indices are similar to cold disk seds in having more flux at longer wavelengths . by using a large flaring index as our default",
    ", we are more conservative when reporting the presence of a hole . surface density is a power law of radius with an index of -1 inside 200 au and then steepens to an index of -12 outside the 200 au outer disk edge .",
    "the dust composition is set to a silicate : carbon ratio of 3:1 with only amorphous , as opposed to crystalline , silicate included .",

    "settling are highly degenerate parameters in the absence of ( sub)millimeter fluxes , so when the disk mass is unknown , the scale height is left at the hydrostatic value ( see note on exception for sources 18 , 19 and 24 in section [ individualnotes ] ) . as a result , model - derived disk masses tend to be systematically small and together with observational upper limits provide a range of likely disk masses .",
    "the inner edge of the disk , when no hole is present , was set at approximately the radius where the dust sublimation temperature , 1500 k , is reached .",
    "some cold disks in the literature have near - infrared excesses most easily modelled as a gap rather than a hole ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , none of the sources in this sample required warm dust within the hole .",
    "those sources which did have some near - infrared excess turned out to be compatible with disk models without holes .",
    "the hole is represented in the model by a hole radius , @xmath51 and a density reduction , set here to a factor of 10@xmath52 , providing an almost entirely clean hole . thus , the four free parameters are @xmath51 , degree of settling , disk inclination and disk mass when there are no measurements .",
    "a two step procedure was used to find the best model fits .",
    "first , we ran a large grid of disk models with a broad range of disk and hole parameters and a limited number of stellar templates .",
    "then , we ran a finer grid of disk and hole parameters , determined from the larger grid , for each individual star using the stellar properties in table [ tab : stellarparameters ] .",
    "a simple @xmath53 minimization was performed at each step between the dereddened seds and the model seds and the resulting best fit is shown as a red dash - dot line in the sed plots ( figures [ seds_figure_holes ] and [ seds_figure_noholes ] ) .",
    "errors on the hole radii are given in table [ tab : diskparams ] based on fits with up to 20% deviation in @xmath53 .",
    "fifteen of the 25 modelled stars require inner holes while the remaining 10 require no hole to fit the sed .",
    "the 10 sources not modelled are the 8 edge - on disks and 2 sources , 25 and 27 , which have strong extended 70 emission and can not be fit with disk models ( see section [ individualnotes ] for further details ) .",
    "hole radii range from 1 au to 55 au .",
    "holes smaller than 1 au can not be firmly identified .",
    "the range of hole radii can be seen in histogram form in figure [ fig : rholehist ] .    in order to confirm our results above and identify the less model - dependent part of our results",
    ", we also fitted our sample seds with the on - line sed fitting tool by @xcite .",
    "this system offers the possibility of fitting young star seds with a precomputed grid of 200,000 synthetic seds from stars , disks and envelopes with a broad range of physical parameters . in order to make these fits , we observed photometry from table [ tab : phottable2 ] and [ tab : phottable1 ] along with a binned irs spectrum in from 6 to 33 @xmath1 m with steps of 1 @xmath1 m .",
    "an aperture of 4.5 arcsec , a distance range from 0.1 to 0.33 kpc and a a@xmath54 range from 0 to 30 mags were used in all fits . for the objects for which the spectral types are known , we select the best fitting model with an effective temperature less than 500 k away from the target s one .",
    "the final best - fit models used are good representation of the median properties of the best fitting models with the appropriate effective temperatures but should not be considered as definitively constrained parameters .",

    "best - fit models for the objects in our sample as thin black dashed lines and table  [ tab : diskparams ] shows their corresponding model i d s and the inner disk radii in the cases where it is clearly distinguishable from the dust destruction radius disk inner radius . in order to overplot the robitaille et al .",
    "models , we corrected them with the extinction law given in the web - fitting tool and using the total a@xmath54 value given by the best - fit model and normalized it to the @xmath55-band dereddened flux .",
    "the @xmath46 values of the best - fit models used are in general in agreement with the @xmath46 values obtained from the spectral type and optical photometry . however , small discrepancies plus small differences in the standard extinction laws used to deredden our photometry and the robitaille models can explain the discrepancies between the robitaille models and optical fluxes in some cases .",
    "all but source 18 of the cold disks in figure [ seds_figure_holes ] also have inner holes with the robitaille et al . models . the only exception ,",
    "source 18 , is a border - line case with an extremely small inner cavity of 0.03 au in the robitaille et al .",
    "best - fit model . on the other hand ,",
    "almost all the objects in figure  [ seds_figure_noholes ] , which have no hole according to the radmc models , show inner cavities smaller than 2 au in the robitaille models . the only exception is source 15 , which is also among the flattest disk in the group .",
    "this indicates that in general terms , the classification of objects as disks with or without inner holes is model independent as long as the disk hole is larger than 2 au .",
    "figure [ fig : rhole_comparison ] compares the disk inner holes estimated both with the radmc and the @xcite disk model grids .",
    "the plot does not include the only outlier ( source 18 ) . for the rest of the sample , the values from both sets of models are correlated , but with a very large scatter .",
    "it must be noted that this comparison is not straight forward as both sets of models have different treatments of the dust opacities , disk flaring angle , and inner hole structure .",
    "also , the robitaille et al . on - line tool does not allow the use of a priori information like the lack of an envelope , or the effective temperature of the central star , both of which have obviously great impact on the final result of the fitting . pursuing a more detailed comparison between both sets of disk models",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper but this comparison shows that the derived disk hole radius is model independent to within a factor of 2 - 3 generally .",
    "we find the radmc models more reliable due to the greater control over the input parameters and the resulting better fits .",
    "the radmc disk radii are therefore used in all further comparisons .",
    "a wide variety of mid - infrared spectral features have been detected in spectra of disks around low- and intermediate mass young stars using iso ( e.g. , @xcite ) and _ spitzer _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these features can serve as diagnostics of physical processes in disks such as grain growth , fragmentation , crystallization , flaring , and uv or x - ray illumination .",
    "an interesting question is whether the spectral features of cold disks differ significantly from those of normal t tauri disks , and if so , what that tells us about the disk structure and evolution .",
    "table [ tab : sampleclass ] identifies the presence or absence of the 10 and 20 @xmath1 m silicate emission features , pahs and crystalline silicate features , where `` y '' means a detection , `` n '' a non - detection and `` t '' a tentative detection .",
    "the spectra presented in figures [ irs_edgeon ] to [ irs_cd_noacc ] clearly show a large variety of features in our sample of cold disks .",
    "the silicate 10 and 20 @xmath1 m features are detected in most cases ; none of the sources show the featureless spectra commonly seen for older ( debris ) disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , only a few sources have pristine ism - like 10 @xmath1 m silicate features , characterized by a strongly peaked profile centered at 9.8 @xmath1 m .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ silicateshape ] , in which the @xmath56 @xmath1 m flux ratio is plotted versus the strength of the feature above the continuum @xmath57 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "the different quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are calculated after normalizing the observed feature as follows @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the local continuum and @xmath63 the mean value of this continuum .",
    "the local continuum is estimated using a second degree polynomial , normalized at 6.87.5 @xmath1 m , 12.513.5 @xmath1 m and 3036 @xmath1 m .",
    "the fluxes are measured as an averaged flux of the continuum - subtracted spectra in a @xmath640.1 @xmath1 m interval at each wavelength .    as shown by @xcite and @xcite , sources in which the grain size distribution is dominated by large @xmath1m - sized , or sources with size distributions much flatter than the mrn size distribution",
    ", grains appear in the upper left corner of the plot whereas those dominated by smaller ism - type grains are located in the lower - right part . for comparison ,",
    "the silicate profile parameters of the c2d sample studied by @xcite and @xcite are overplotted ( grey dots ) .",
    "it is seen that the cold disks fall mostly in the upper left part of the figure , indicating that the dust in these disks has already undergone non - negligible grain growth .",
    "no significant difference was found in the 10 @xmath1 m shape for accreting or non - accreting objects .",
    "this conclusion is not affected by crystallization or sedimentation of dust toward the midplane , which causes some spread in the relation but can not reproduce the observed trend , as discussed extensively in @xcite and @xcite .    some confirmed disks with inner holes show crystalline silicate features , either the forsterite feature at 33 @xmath1 m and/or the 23 and 28 @xmath1 m complexes ( see @xcite for definition of these features ) . the fraction is between 33% and 60% ( 5 - 9/15 ) with the range due to some tentative detections limited by the low signal - to - noise ratio in some spectra .",
    "a prominent example of a highly crystalline spectrum is that of object 10 , sstc2d j034227.1 + 314433 , a cold disk in perseus ( see figure [ irs_cd_noacc ] ) .",
    "this detection frequency of crystalline material is comparable to the 55% found for the c2d sample of normal ctts disks based on long - wavelength features , whereas @xcite claim an even higher fraction of 94% for normal disks in taurus ( see discussion in olofsson et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the detection of pahs is based on at least two of the features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , 12.8 and 16.4 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "overall , pah features are detected in 13% ( 2/15 ) of the cold disks in our sample .",
    "this is similar to the fraction of 1114% found by @xcite for a sample of normal ctts disks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this low detection fraction not only reflects the fact that late - type stars have less uv and optical photons to excite the pahs but also implies a pah abundance in disks that is typically a factor of 10100 lower than in the normal interstellar medium , taken to be @xmath65 with respect to total hydrogen for pah species with 100 carbon atoms ( e.g. , c@xmath66h@xmath67 ) @xcite .",
    "both sources 25 and 27 , which have long wavelength fluxes composed of extended material , show exceptionally strong pah features .",
    "both have low continuum at mid - infrared wavelengths increasing the line - to - continuum contrast . in the case of source 27 , even the 16.4 @xmath1 m band",
    "is clearly revealed ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pah ] ) .",
    "the strong features seen in cold disks do not necessarily imply higher pah abundances than in normal ctts disks , however .",
    "@xcite model the pah emission in disks with varying degrees of sedimentation , as characterized by the @xmath16 parameter of turbulence . in the case of low turbulence , @xmath68 , the big grains quickly sediment to the midplane but",
    "the pahs stay in the upper layers , boosting the feature - to - continuum ratio by a factor of 210 . for high turbulence , @xmath69 ,",
    "the small and big grains stay well mixed in the upper layers , resulting in the typically weak or absent pahs features consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not consider disks with inner holes , but qualitatively the effect is similar to their low turbulence case in which the big grains are removed and the features strengths are boosted .",
    "in contrast with the silicates , the pah emission arises not only from the inner disk but also from the outer disk surface exposed to optical and uv radiation .",
    "indeed , spatially extended pah emission has been detected out to @xmath060 au or more for some disks ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "two cold disks within the c2d clouds , sr 21 and t cha , are included in the observations of @xcite using vlt - isaac and vlt - visir to get higher spatial resolution compared with _",
    "spitzer_. in both cases , the emission is found to be spatially unresolved , with limiting spatial extents ( fwhm ) of 19 and 13 au , respectively .",
    "these limits are comparable to the values of @xmath51 of 18 and 15 au , respectively ( @xcite , table [ tab : diskparams ] ) , indicating that the pahs are located primarily inside the gaps . for the case of sr 21 ,",
    "the location of the gas inside the gap has been pinpointed to a ring at @xmath70 au radius @xcite , proving that the gas emission is indeed coming from inside the gap and not from the outer edge or wall of the gap .",
    "since pahs are likely coupled to the gas , pah emission , when present , serves as confirmation of the presence of gas inside the gap .",
    "unfortunately we see no correlation between pahs and accretion , both of which should trace gas within the holes .",
    "this is likely due to the dependence of pah emission on strong uv flux which is lacking from late - type stars .",
    "sources 10 , 12 , 14 , 20 , 22 , 23 , 29 and 30 have neither 70 nor 1.3 mm fluxes available .",
    "this makes it very difficult to distinguish between a low mass disk and a more massive disk with an inner hole .",
    "the difference between the two lies in the presence of a substantial outer disk .",
    "the 70 limits sometimes hint at the absence of such an outer disk but the limits are not always very stringent .",
    "unless there is compelling evidence from the long wavelength irs spectra , we have taken the conservative view that these are likely low mass disks and can be explained without needing to invoke an inner hole .",
    "two sources , 25 and 27 , have extremely strong , extended 70 emission and do not appear to be disks .",
    "in both cases , it is likely that surrounding material has contaminated the long wavelength photometry , producing these strange seds ( see figure [ seds_figure_edgeon ] ) .",
    "source 25 , doar 21 , has been better studied than many of the other sources in this sample .",
    "resolved imaging of h@xmath71 shows an extended ring structure at 73 - 219 au away from the star ( hogeheijde et al .",
    "2009 , submitted ) .",
    "@xcite have speculated that much of the flux in long wavelength unresolved photometry comes from cloud material that the star is heating .",
    "thus , while the sed looks compatible with a large inner hole , this might be due to excess material not directly associated with the star with long wavelength fluxes being increasingly affected .",
    "source 27 has a similar sed and we suspect may arise from a similar physical situation .",
    "both objects show exceptionally strong pah emission ( see figure [ fig : pah ] and   [ pah ] ) . within a disk structure ,",
    "the strong 70 fluxes indicate large amounts of dust at 100 - 200 au and good sed fits required unphysical input parameters .",
    "objects with very pronounced 70 @xmath1 m excesses but small 24 @xmath1 m excesses have been found to be produced by background contamination in the great majority of the cases ( wahhaj et al .",
    "2009 , submitted ) .",
    "for these reasons , we have removed these objects from further study .",
    "the 70 flux of source 17 is affected by strong variable background emission , clearly visible in the c2d mips-70 image .",
    "two photometric points are given in the sed ( figure [ seds_figure_holes ] ) with the larger being the full aperture flux and the smaller a psf aperture flux .",
    "the actual flux may be even smaller .",
    "the 24 image does not show background emission and is in good agreement with irs spectra .",
    "although there is evidence for background contamination in the long wavelength sed of this object , a sensible fit was possible with a disk with a hole .",
    "sources 11 , 12 , 13 , 17 , and 18 have stellar temperatures lower than the kurucz model grid and a blackbody is used instead .",
    "sources 18 , 19 and 24 form a distinct subset of our sample .",
    "these three disks all have little to no near - ir excess but very flat disks longward of 8 .",
    "while there does appear to be a discontinuity between the inner and outer disks , the difference is not large . despite the unknown disk mass , some degree of settling in the outer disk",
    "was required to reproduce the sed shape .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that objects 2 , 13 and 33 ( 15% of the cold disk sample ) show factor of 2 differences between irac and irs fluxes in the overlapping wavelength range which are too large to be due to calibration errors . in the particular case of object 33 , which has the largest difference , only the irs spectrum hints at a possible inner hole , while the irac photometry could be easily explained without a hole .",
    "a careful check of the extraction of the irs spectra and irac photometry found no evidence of extended emission , mis - alignment in the irs observations , or any other instrumental reason for the discrepancy .",
    "indeed , only 6 objects ( 4% ) out of the 147 irs observed disks in the serpens irs survey have similar flux discrepancies between irac and irs ( oliveira , i. , 2010 , priv .",
    "the irac observations were taken approximately 2 years before the spectroscopic ones ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "similar scale variability was reported in @xcite for another transitional disk .",
    "such intrinsic variability might be the cause of this phenomenon but systematics between spectra and photometry could cause complications and further investigation is outside the scope of this work .",
    "determining concrete selection criteria for cold disks is necessary to identify cold disks efficiently out of large _",
    "spitzer _ samples . previously cold disks have been identified in spectral samples using 30/13 flux ratios and slopes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these two wavelengths bracket the rise in flux between an inner dust hole and substantial outer disk for holes with radii between 1 and 100 au around stars with a representative range of stellar masses .",
    "the disks in this sample provide confirmation of this classification with 93% ( 14/15 ) of the cold disks having @xmath72/@xmath73 flux ratios between 5 and 15 ( see figure [ fig:3013 ] ) .",
    "the only disk with @xmath72/@xmath73@xmath245 is source 2 , which has one of the smallest holes .",
    "edge - on disks generally lie above @xmath72/@xmath73=15 but three overlap with the cold disk region .",
    "there is also not a clean separation between normal and cold disks at @xmath72/@xmath73=5 .",
    "the 30/13 flux ratio has a crude correlation with larger hole sizes having larger flux ratios , but there is unfortunately no clear relation between the 30/13 flux ratios and the slope between _ spitzer _ 8 and 24 photometry , particularly for cold disks .",
    "thus 8 to 24 slopes and colors can not be used as a proxy for estimating hole size , although they can be used to select cold disks , as we discuss in the next section .      to identify the cold disk candidates out of the yso population",
    ", we tested several combinations of color - color diagrams with different _ spitzer _ bands to determine the cleanest identification of disks with inner holes ( cold disks ) .",
    "we included not only the results of the detailed sed fitting from   [ diskparameters ] but also literature information about cold disks in the c2d clouds including two sources from @xcite and two sources from @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria proposed here can be applied to any _ spitzer _ irac and mips yso photometric sample of any star - forming region to identify the disks with inner holes .",
    "the criteria are based on colors without dereddening as the extinction to many of the sources in the catalog is unknown .",
    "the effects of a@xmath74=10 are plotted as an arrow on the diagrams .",
    "the effects are small for extinctions less than 10 .",
    "analysis of the spectral sample based on deredden colors provides little difference to the selection regions .",
    "the cold disk candidate sample is defined with the following cuts in magnitudes , organized in two sections for two different types of objects ( see top left figure [ fig : criteria ] ) : region a selects `` clean '' inner holes ( i.e. disks for which there is no substantial excess in any irac band and the signature of an inner opacity hole ) .",
    "region b selects disks with some excess disk flux in the irac bands .",
    "the definition of the boundaries are the following :    @xmath75-[8.0]\\,<\\,1.1\\,;\\,\\,\\,3.2\\,<\\,[8.0]-[24]\\,<\\,5.3\\ ] ]    @xmath76-[8.0]\\,<\\,1.8\\,;\\,\\,\\,3.2\\,<\\,[8.0]-[24]\\,<\\,5.3\\ ] ]    region b contains the 4 literature sources plus source 2 , while the majority of the new cold disks ( 13/15 ) lie in region a. one possible explanation for this division is the focus of this work on looking for photospheric fluxes in the near - ir , while disks with large holes often have small near - ir excesses ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    from the overall photometric catalog , the statistics on cold disks within the five c2d clouds can be determined , including sources not included in the spectroscopic follow - up for a variety of reasons such as low fluxes .",
    "these disks are marked with small crosses in figure [ fig : criteria ] .",
    "there are 43 cold disk candidates in region a accounting for 4% of the total disk population in the c2d yso catalog .",
    "only one of the objects in that region for which we performed detailed sed modeling including the irs spectrum was a false positive .",
    "this is object 25 , doar 21 , which has a cold disk - like sed but the 70 flux may be strongly contaminated by cloud material ( see   [ individualnotes ] for further details ) . from the spectroscopically studied objects in region a , 93% are cold disks .",
    "region b is more complicated . while there are well studied ,",
    "confirmed cold disks within this region , there are many objects which are not cold disks .",
    "region b contains 181 ysos in the c2d catalog , but fewer sources were selected for our study from this region . of this small subsample and excluding the rising sources , for which it is not possible to determine the presence of an inner hole in the disk , only 42% of the studied disks turned out to be cold disks , so we estimate a contamination on the order of 58% in this region .",
    "these percentages have considerable uncertainty given the low - number statistics .",
    "region b includes the disks wsb 60 and doar 44 , for which inner holes of 20 and 33 au , respectively , have been resolved with the sma but whose seds show no detectable signature of them @xcite .",
    "this implies that selecting purely on broadband colors will always be prone to uncertainty .",
    "individual source modeling , spectroscopic studies and non - sed based searches are all needed to fully understand cold disk frequencies , particularly in this region of the color - color parameter space .",
    "if we add together the 43 objects in region a with 42% of the 181 objects in region b , we have a total of 119 cold disks in the sample ( 12% of the yso catalog of 1024 sources ) .",
    "therefore , the fraction of 4% of cold disks quoted above should be interpreted as safe lower limits to the actual population of disks with inner holes in the c2d yso catalog .",
    "the analysis of this photometric sample is outside the scope of this paper and will be presented in a separate article .",
    "considering the irs flux - limited sample in serpens where all disks have irs spectra , we confirm the presence of 8 cold disks , which account for 9% of the total @xcite .",
    "this range of cold disk frequencies of 4 - 10% comes with some caveats .",
    "transitional disks with very low mass outer disks are not included in this study ( as the ones discussed in e.g. @xcite ) , but are often included in other transitional disk frequency statistics .",
    "such disks may represent a later stage of cold disk evolution or a completely different evolutionary pathway .",
    "disks with holes smaller than 1 au can not be reliably identified .",
    "disks with large holes but with some near - ir excess can also be difficult to identify from photometry .",
    "a final consideration is the potential bias introduced by the c2d yso selection criteria themselves .",
    "the c2d yso sample is biased against objects with photospheric colors and only includes sources with good detections at all irac bands plus at mips 24 @xmath1 m band .",
    "this obviously imposes bias which is a difficult to determine against selecting transitional disks in regions with very high background emission , like e.g. the ic 348 or @xmath77 oph clusters . in any case",
    ", the effect seems not to be a dominant one since most of the cold disk candidates found with the color selection proposed here are clustered in a similar manner as the rest of the ysos around the dense high - background clusters , while we should see a lack of such objects in high background areas otherwise .",
    "@xcite also recently proposed color - color diagram cuts to select cold disks .",
    "their criteria form a trapezoid in k-[5.8 ] vs. [ 8.0]-[24 ] color - color space defined by k-[5.8 ] @xmath34 0 , [ 8.0]-[24 ] @xmath34 2.5 and the last side by k-[5.8]@xmath24(0.56+([8.0]-[24])x0.15 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : criteria]b , we evaluate these criteria based on our spectrally confirmed cold disks .",
    "most of the disks in our sample fall within or close to this area . of our cold disks ,",
    "13/15 are within the boundaries while the remaining two are only just above the upper sloped line .",
    "however , half ( 6/12 ) of the disks without holes also lie within this region as well as some ( 3/8 ) of the edge - on disks .",
    "cold disks can be preferentially selected by cutting higher in [ 8.0]-[24 ] at @xmath0 3.5 instead of 2.5 .",
    "this would exclude more of the candidates that do not have inner holes while including all the disks with holes and also have the benefit of having a greater separation from the bulk sample in the larger catalog ( shown in the figure as small gray crosses ) .",
    "the region of [ 8.0]-[24 ] between 2.5 and 3.5 has the potential to include transitional disks with low mass outer regions , but individual disk modeling is needed to confirm the nature of these sources .",
    "an upper limit in [ 8.0]-[24 ] is also needed to remove the edge - on disks , with [ 8.0]-[24]@xmath245 producing a reasonably clean separation .",
    "@xcite use slopes in log @xmath78 vs. log @xmath2 between 3.6 and 5.8 , @xmath79 , vs 8 to 24 , @xmath80 .",
    "they propose that all transitional disks lie below -1.8 in @xmath79 with weak excess sources between @xmath81 and @xmath82 and normal cold disks at @xmath830 .",
    "our sources lying within the weak excess region were all found not to need holes to fit the seds .",
    "the normal cold disk region selects similar sources to region a but sources within region b are not selected by the @xcite criteria .",
    "@xcite adopt a wider definition of transitional disks ( e.g. they include objects with very small 24 excesses ) , and their selection criteria are therefore less useful for identifying cold disks .",
    "transitional disks are taken to be in the quadrant defined by [ 3.6]-[24]@xmath342 and [ 3.6]-[4.5]@xmath240.25 .",
    "just over half ( 12/19 ) of the cold disks lie within the selected quadrant , with 7 cold disks missed by this criteria ( generally those with more massive outer disks ) .",
    "almost half ( 5/12 ) of the disks without holes lie within the region and in the exact same position as the disks with holes . these disks may be homologously depleted transitional disks .",
    "a fairly large fraction of the catalog classical disk locus lies within the selected region and might lead to a large false detection rate of cold disks .",
    "one of the most obvious characteristics of this cold disk sample is the relatively small hole sizes ( see distribution in figure [ fig : rholehist ] ) .",
    "many of the irs selected cold disks in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) have large holes with radii greater than 10 au .",
    "of the 15 cold disks examined here , only three have hole sizes larger than 10 au while an additional four large hole sources within the clouds are identified in the literature @xcite . this may indicate that cold disks with very large holes ( @xmath3410 au ) are intrinsically rarer than disks with smaller holes .",
    "large hole sizes are easy to see from irs spectra but may not be as obvious from photometry .",
    "one complication is that disks with large inner holes often have some near - ir excess making the disks difficult to identify from irac colors .",
    "another possible complication arises from the different disk models and methods used to determine the inner disk hole radii .",
    "in particular , the possibility can not be ruled out that the radmc models , which do not include viscous heating due to accretion tend to produce smaller inner holes than other accreting disk models used by e.g. @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hole radii determined with same models and methods by @xcite were confirmed by the direct sma observations of three disks by brown et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the similarity in terms of infrared seds of the two millimeter - discovered cold disks in ophiuchus @xcite to classical disks means millimeter surveys , as well as infrared , would be needed to ensure that all cold disks were found and to robustly confirm this trend .",
    "the differences in the definition of transitional disks between the works of @xcite and @xcite were also extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "we find a statistically significant positive correlation between disk mass and hole size ( see figure [ fig : dmass ] ) .",
    "the correlation has a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0.6 and is statistically significant on the 99% level including upper limits on disk mass and on the 90% level with only detected sources . to minimize systematic differences , disk masses for sources from @xcite",
    "have been recalculated using the 1.3 mm fluxes in @xcite and the flux to disk mass conversion in section [ diskmass ] .",
    "the dependence of hole size on disk mass may point to a gravitational process , with more massive disks more likely to form more massive planets in larger orbits .",
    "the masses of transitional disks relative to normal disks remains unclear .",
    "@xcite finds that transitional disks have larger disk masses for a sample of transitional disks in taurus , although their disk classification method is different .",
    "@xcite find very small disk masses for a sample of non - accreting weak - lined t tauri stars .",
    "this trend may help explain the different results of the studies as @xcite focused mainly on cold disks from the literature which generally have large holes and are often accreting , while @xcite were likely more sensitive to disks with smaller holes and no accretion .",
    "@xcite find a correlation between hole size and stellar mass in their transitional disk sample in chamaeleon and taurus .",
    "unfortunately , our sample is too similar in stellar mass to accurately test this trend and there is no correlation found from our sample alone .",
    "however , combining with the @xcite sample ( see figure [ fig : rholemstar ] ) retains a correlation between the size of the inner holes and the stellar masses .",
    "the disks from @xcite are in agreement with the @xcite trend while the disks in this paper generally lie below the trend line , indicating smaller hole sizes",
    ". this may be partly due to the generally lower disk masses in this sample leading to smaller hole sizes based on the correlation in figure [ fig : dmass ] .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we see no trends with @xmath84 , a measure of overall disk evolution ( see table [ tab : diskparams ] ) .",
    "@xmath84 measures the integrated infrared excess normalized by the stellar luminosity and primarily traces the total grain surface area that is reprocessing stellar light . as disks become more tenuous , settle and disappear , the strength of the disk luminosity should decline .",
    "this measure is commonly used in debris disk studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is no correlation with hole size nor are there significant differences in @xmath84 between the sources with and without holes in this sample .",
    "therefore , if @xmath84 can indeed be used as a probe for disk flaring , then this points to a distinct lack of settling in the outer regions of cold disks .",
    "alternatively , this might also imply that @xmath84 is not especially sensitive to the changes in the disk flaring while the outer disk keeps being optically thick .",
    "the majority ( 9/12 , 75% ) of the cold disks with h@xmath16 spectra are accreting .",
    "accretion is a particularly interesting diagnostic in transitional disks as it indicates material inside the hole .",
    "large fractions of accreting cold disks indicate that in many cases gas must be flowing through the hole as any inner gas reservoir would drain quickly .",
    "this is in contrast with the results by @xcite , who report lower mass accretion rates in transitional disks with respect to the classical t tauri stars in taurus , although using a completely different definition of transitional disk from the one used here .",
    "silicate emission probes dust properties such as grain size and crystallinity .",
    "silicate emission , especially the distinct 10 silicate stretching band , is seen from all but one of the cold disks .",
    "however , the presence and intensity of the 10 @xmath1 m feature decreases substantially for inner holes radii larger than 7 - 10 au ( figure [ fig : rhole_silicates ] ) .",
    "this is partly to be expected as dust - depleted inner holes result in a lack of silicate grains at the correct disk temperatures to produce the features .",
    "a large fraction of the cold disks show crystalline features at wavelengths longer than 20 indicating processing which likely occurred in the inner regions of the disks where temperature and densities are high .",
    "these regions are now largely depleted in the cold disks but dust mixing , fragmentation of larger bodies or alternative formation routes have resulted in detectable amounts remaining further out in the disk .",
    "the origins of inner holes are still under debate among several theories developed to explain inner holes and gaps in protoplanetary disks , including i ) euv photoevaporation of the inner disk @xcite , ii ) settling and coagulation of dust into large particles @xcite , or iii ) by the dynamical perturbation of unresolved companions , both stars @xcite and planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that all are present on some level but it is not clear which are dominant in which systems @xcite .    for photoevaporation , an inner hole occurs when the photoevaporation rate driven by the euv ionizing flux from the central star matches the viscous accretion rate @xcite .",
    "fuv photoevaporation also plays a significant role in dissipating disks but predominantly removes less bound gas from the outer regions and would therefore not create cold disk seds @xcite .",
    "photoevaporation is most effective when accretion rates are low and would result in no gas or dust close to the star within 0.1 - 1 myr , depending on assumed disk properties such as viscosity and treatment of the uv ionizing flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of accretion in such a large fraction ( 75% ) of this sample discards photoevaporation as the primary origin .",
    "some disks with inner holes do show evidence for photoevaporation based on [ ne ii ] observations but the implied mass loss rates are too low to disperse the disk in under 10 myr @xcite .",
    "the disk masses of the remaining 25% are typically low enough that photoevaporation could be the cause of the inner hole .    accelerated grain growth in the inner regions",
    "could produce cold disk seds as dust grains became too big to be observed @xcite .",
    "models predict that dust particles grow and settle towards the dense disk mid - plane , where they may stick together to form planetesimals @xcite .",
    "growth is likely preferential in the inner disk , and these larger bodies will grow and can eventually accrete a large fraction of the surrounding gas to become giant planets ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . in this scenario ,",
    "grain growth and settling would happen throughout the disk but with faster timescales in the inner region .",
    "if grain growth is accompanied by settling throughout the disk , decreasing @xmath84 with increasing hole size would be expected .",
    "we do not see this for our sample making this unlikely to be the dominant scenario although such a correlation for a subsample of the sources may be masked by short inner disk settling timescales or objects formed by different mechanisms .",
    "another potential complication is that coagulation in the inner regions would not effect @xmath84 in the absence of settling in the outer disk .",
    "holes created via grain growth are likely to have more gradual hole edges compared to holes created by companions .",
    "binary companions are a possible explanation for cold disk seds .",
    "some candidate cold disks , such as coku tau 4 , have been later determined to be circumbinary @xcite .",
    "the issue clearly requires further high - resolution imaging of these sources ( e.g. @xcite ) or radial velocity measurements to confirm the possible presence of stellar or substellar - mass companions .",
    "however , this is time consuming for large samples and may not even be possible for more distant regions or planets at larger radii which require long term monitoring . preliminary results of binary searches show that close binary companions often result in the complete dissipation of the disk and that circumbinary `` transition '' disks may not be common @xcite .",
    "if stellar companions carve out inner holes , accretion may either continue or cease depending on the separation and mass ratio of the two stars @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if a planet carves out an inner hole accretion can continue at a reduced rate aided by mechanisms such as the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "inner holes created by planets remains a popular and exciting explanation .",
    "of the scenarios described this is the most difficult to positively confirm or deny .",
    "planets are faint so direct observation is difficult while their small masses leave weaker gravitational signatures on the disk than stellar companions .",
    "the inner hole radii are compatible with the distribution of exoplanet semi - major axis , as found in the latest exoplanet database as of december 2009 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rholemstar ] ) . as the exoplanets likely formed in similar disks before dissipation , it is likely that there are young exo - planets in some disks at these types of radii but whether they are responsible for the cold disk signatures discussed in this paper remains to be determined .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized here :    * optical spectra , 2mass and _ spitzer _ photometry , millimeter continuum observations and _ spitzer_/irs 5 to 35 @xmath1 m spectra of a sample of 35 cold disk candidates selected from c2d photometry are presented and analyzed . * out of 35 objects in the initial sample , sed modeling identifies 15 as disks with inner holes , which we call `` cold disks '' , following the c2d convention @xcite . of the remaining sources , 10",
