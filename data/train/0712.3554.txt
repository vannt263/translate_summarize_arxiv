    "ghost imaging is the acquisition of an object s transverse transmittance pattern by means of photocurrent correlation measurements . in a generic ghost imaging experiment ( see the example in fig .  [",
    "gi : propagation ] ) , a classical or quantum source that generates two paraxial optical fields is utilized .",
    "these fields propagate in two different directions , through a linear system of optical elements that may include lenses and mirrors , and arrive at their respective detection planes . at one detection plane",
    ", the incident field illuminates a thin transmission mask , whose spatial transmissivity is the pattern to be measured , and is subsequently detected by a bucket detector that provides no transverse spatial resolution . at the other detection plane ,",
    "the incident field , which has never interacted with the transmission mask , is detected by a pinhole detector centered at some transverse coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "the two photocurrents are then correlated and the output value is registered .",
    "this process is repeated as the pinhole detector is scanned along the transverse plane .",
    "the resulting correlation measurements , when viewed as a function of @xmath1 , reveals the power transmissivity of the mask .",
    "the image obtained by this procedure has been called a  ghost image , \" because the bucket detector that captures the optical field which illuminated the transmission mask has no spatial resolution , and the the pinhole detector measures a field that never interacted with the transmission mask  @xcite .    the first demonstration of ghost imaging utilized biphoton - state light obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion together with photon - counting bucket and pinhole detectors .",
    "this arrangement yielded a background - free image that was interpreted as a quantum phenomenon , owing to the entanglement of the source photons @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite considerations demonstrated that ghost imaging can be performed with thermalized laser light , utilizing either photon - counting detectors or ccd detector arrays to obtain ghost images , albeit with a background .",
    "the theory of biphoton ghost imaging requires quantum descriptions for both the optical source and its photodetection statistics , whereas thermal - light ghost imaging admits to a semiclassical description employing classical fields and shot - noise limited detectors .",
    "this disparity has sparked interest @xcite in establishing a unifying theory that characterizes the fundamental physics of ghost imaging and delineates the boundary between classical and quantum behavior . in this paper",
    "we develop that unifying theory within the framework of gaussian - state ( classical and nonclassical ) sources .",
    "the foundation of our work is laid in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] .",
    "here we begin by expressing the photocurrent cross - correlation  the ghost image  as a filtered fourth - moment of the field operators illuminating the detectors .",
    "next , we briefly review the quantum - optics definition of classical states and specialize that discussion to zero - mean gaussian states . then , using the moment - factoring theorem for zero - mean gaussian states , we obtain our fundamental expression for the gaussian - state ghost image in terms of the phase - insensitive and phase - sensitive cross - correlations between the two detected fields , plus a background .",
    "the final part of sec .",
    "[ analysis ] sets the stage for detailed understanding of ghost imaging by extending the standard theory of coherence propagation to include phase - sensitive field states .",
    "section  [ nfvsffgaussianstates ] analyzes ghost imaging performed with three classes of gaussian - state sources .",
    "we first consider a source possessing the maximum phase - insensitive cross - correlation  as constrained by its auto - correlation functions  but no phase - sensitive cross - correlation .",
    "such a source always produces a classical state .",
    "thermal light is of this class .",
    "we also consider a source with the maximum _ classical _ phase - sensitive cross - correlation , given the same auto - correlations as in the previous case , but no phase - insensitive cross - correlation .",
    "finally , we treat the latter source when its phase - sensitive cross - correlation is the maximum permitted by quantum mechanics . the low - brightness , low - flux limit of this quantum source is the biphoton state .",
    "thus these source classes span the experiments reported in @xcite within a unified analytical framework while admitting classical phase - sensitive light as a new possibility . in sec .",

    "the photodetectors are assumed to have identical sub - unity quantum efficiencies and finite electrical bandwidths , but no dark current or thermal noise ( from subsequent electronics ) contributes to the output current .",
    "figure  [ quantumphotodetector ] shows the model utilized for the photodetectors , in which a beam splitter with field - transmissivity @xmath24 precedes an ideal photodetector to model the real detector s sub - unity quantum efficiency , and a low - pass filter with a real impulse response @xmath25 follows the ideal photodetector to model the real detector s finite electrical bandwidth .",
    "it follows that the classical output currents from the two detectors correspond to the following quantum measurements @xcite : @xmath26 for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a vacuum - state field operator .",

    "so far we have opted for the quantum description of our ghost imaging configuration , because it applies equally well to both classical - state and nonclassical - state sources . for the former case , however",
    ", we could have arrived at an equivalent answer by use of semiclassical theory . in particular , for a classical - state source we could replace the field operators with scalar classical electromagnetic fields , then employ scalar diffraction theory plus the shot - noise theory for photodetection to arrive at the photocurrent correlation expression in eq .   , but with the field - operator fourth moment replaced by a classical - field fourth moment . because a principal goal of this paper is to identify the classical / quantum boundary in ghost imaging ,",
    "it is incumbent upon us to first review the quantum mechanical states that can generate photocurrent correlations which can not be obtained from classical electromagnetism and shot - noise theory .",
    "consider the ideal photodetector from fig .",
    "[ quantumphotodetector ] , i.e , one with unity quantum efficiency , zero dark current and infinite electrical bandwidth , for which individual photon detection events are registered instantaneously as current impulses carrying charge @xmath28 .",
    "in semiclassical theory , the scalar optical field impinging on the photosensitive surface of the photodetector is a positive - frequency classical electromagnetic wave , denoted by @xmath33 . in accordance with the quantum description",
    "above , we assume that this field is paraxial , normalized to have units @xmath4 , and has center frequency @xmath5 . conditioned on knowledge of the field impinging on the photodetector , we have that @xmath34 , is an inhomogeneous poisson impulse train with rate function @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the detector s photosensitive region .",
    "thus , regardless of whether the illuminating field is deterministic or random , the photocurrent is subject to the noise that is inherent in this poisson process , which yields the well known shot - noise floor of semiclassical photodetection theory @xcite .",
    "randomness in the illumination is then accounted for by taking @xmath37 to be a stochastic process , as is done in classical statistical optics @xcite .    in the quantum theory of photodetection ,",
    "the classical photocurrent produced by the same ideal photodetector is a stochastic process whose statistics coincide with those of the photon - flux operator measurement scaled by the electron charge @xcite , @xmath38 the photocurrent statistics are then governed by the state of the field operator @xmath39 , so the shot - noise limit of semiclassical theory can be surpassed by some states , such as amplitude - squeezed states , or the eigenkets of continuous - time photodetection @xcite .    in our quantum treatment of ghost imaging , the states of the optical field operator @xmath39 that we shall deem _ classical _ are those for which the measurement statistics predicted by quantum photodetection theory match those predicted by the semiclassical theory .",
    "it has long been known @xcite that when @xmath40 is in the coherent state @xmath41 , indexed by its eigenfunction @xmath42 and satisfying @xmath43 the statistics of the @xmath44 measurement are identical to those from the semiclassical theory with the impinging classical field taken to be @xmath42 . more generally , the two photodetection theories yield identical statistics for any quantum state that is a classical statistical mixture of coherent states  viz . , for all states that have proper @xmath45-representations @xcite  when the classical field used in the semiclassical theory is comprised of the same statistical mixture of the coherent - state eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "moreover , mixtures of coherent states are the only quantum states for which all quantum photodetection statistics coincide with the corresponding results found from the semiclassical theory .    the quantum and semiclassical theories of photodetection accord very different physical interpretations to their fundamental noise sources  quantum noise of the illuminating field versus shot noise arising from the discreteness of the electron charge ",
    "but for quantum states with proper @xmath45-representations their predictions are quantitatively indistinguishable .",
    "so , because the correlation measurement at the heart of ghost imaging is a derived statistic from two photodetection measurements , the quantum theory of ghost imaging using states that have proper @xmath45-representations is equivalent to the classical theory of ghost imaging using ( classical ) random optical fields plus shot - noise detection theory . therefore , any truly quantum features of ghost imaging must be exclusive to optical field states that do _ not  possess proper @xmath45-representations .",
    "_      gaussian states offer both a practically relevant and a theoretically convenient framework for studying ghost imaging .",
    "their practical relevance stems from thermal states and the biphoton state being special instances of gaussian states .",
    "their theoretical convenience arises from their being completely determined by their first and second moments , and from their closure under linear transformations . moreover , as noted in sec .",
    "i , gaussian - state sources span the experiments reported in @xcite and admit to the additional case of classical phase - sensitive light .",
    "hence they provide an excellent unifying framework within which to probe the distinction between quantum and classical behavior in ghost imaging .    because the experiments in @xcite employed zero - mean states",

    "for convenience , and with no loss of generality , we shall assume that @xmath56    with the exception of the behavior of a background term , the physics of ghost imaging will be shown to arise entirely from the spatial terms in the preceding correlation functions .",
    "these will be taken to have schell - model forms @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 , so that this function may be regarded as a ( possibly complex - valued ) pupil function that truncates a statistically homogeneous random field with phase - insensitive auto - correlations @xmath59 , phase - insensitive cross - correlation @xmath60 , and phase - sensitive cross - correlation @xmath61 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath62 is a real - valued even function of its argument @xcite .",
    "our task , in the rest of this subsection , is to establish the correlation - function bounds that distinguish between classical and quantum behavior for the preceding jointly gaussian states .",
    "let us begin with gaussian - state signal and reference fields that have only phase - insensitive correlations , i.e. , assume that @xmath63 .",
    "then , the phase - insensitive correlation spectra , given by the three - dimensional fourier transforms @xmath64 must satisfy @xcite the cauchy - schwarz inequality , @xmath65 from stochastic process theory @xcite . because the correlation spectra in fully determine the zero - mean , phase - insensitive , gaussian state we are considering , this inequality is both necessary and sufficient to conclude ( via the equivalence developed in sec .",
    "[ semiclvsquantum ] ) that all phase - insensitive gaussian states have proper @xmath45-representations , and are therefore classical  @xcite .",
    "the 50/50 beam splitting of a continuous - wave laser beam that has first been transmitted through a rotating ground - glass diffuser  as was done in the experiments of @xcite  yields signal and reference fields that are in a zero - mean , phase - insensitive , jointly gaussian state in which is satisfied with equality .",
    "now let us examine the more interesting case in which the zero - mean gaussian - state signal and reference fields have a non - zero phase - sensitive cross - correlation , but no phase - insensitive cross - correlation . here",
    "we will find that their joint state need _ not _ have a proper @xmath45-representation , viz .",

    "thus it might seem that there is little distinction between classical and quantum gaussian states in this limit .",
    "while this will be seen below to be so for ghost imaging ( when background is neglected ) , 50/50 linear combinations of the signal and reference fields will be highly squeezed  thus highly nonclassical  when @xmath69 . at the other extreme , for @xmath70 ,",
    "the quantum upper bound is approximately @xmath71 , which is significantly greater than the classical upper bound @xmath72 .",
    "the phase - insensitive correlation spectrum @xmath72 specifies the brightness of the signal and idler fields in units of photons .",

    "so , because the pure state given in eq .   is the low - brightness , low - flux equivalent of the zero - mean jointly gaussian state with maximum phase - sensitive cross - correlation and no phase - insensitive cross - correlation , it is clear that gaussian - state analysis encompasses the previous biphoton treatments of ghost imaging using spdc .    as a final point about jointly gaussian states ,",
    "let us note how one may obtain classical phase - sensitive cross - correlations between the signal and reference fields .",

    "now , let us put the modes associated with the @xmath224 into a zero - mean , jointly gaussian state whose only non - zero phase - insensitive cross - correlations are , @xmath229 and whose only non - zero phase - sensitive cross - correlations are @xmath230 whence @xmath231    classical gaussian states must have correlations that obey the cauchy - schwarz inequalities from and , see @xcite .",
    "thus eqs .   and",
    "imply that the modal auto - correlations must obey @xmath232 and @xmath233 for @xmath216 .",
    "we will take the modal auto - correlations to equal these lower bounds , by assuming that @xmath234 we shall also assume that all modal correlations  aside from those which have already been specified vanish .",
    "equations  , , and then determine the zero - mean , jointly gaussian state of the four fields , @xmath235 , which is the tensor product of zero - mean , jointly gaussian states of @xmath236 and @xmath237 , because all their cross - correlations are zero . defining the signal and reference fields via @xmath238",
    "thus yields a pair of field operators that are in a zero - mean , jointly gaussian , _",
    "classical  state with the desired phase - sensitive and phase - insensitive cross - correlation functions . _",
    "other ghost imaging configurations replace the scanning pinhole detector with a ccd array for parallel data acquisition , or separate the object plane and the detection plane to allow greater flexibility in implementation , or image in reflectance rather than transmission .",
    "these variations do not affect the fundamental physics that governs ghost imaging , and , with the exception of separating the object and detection planes , will not be discussed herein .",
    "the signal and reference fields obtained from spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) will not have space - time correlation functions that take these specific forms , because of the space - time coupling that is inherent in spdc phase - matching relations .",
    "however , these assumptions , which are commonly - employed in coherence theory , simplify the analytical treatment without compromising the fundamental physics that yield a ghost image @xcite .      because zero - mean gaussian states are completely determined by their correlation functions , implies , via the moment - factoring theorem for gaussian states , that all higher - order moments of the signal and reference fields will be admissible moments for a pair of classical stochastic processes .",
    "therefore , the characteristic functional for this gaussian state  which is a generating function for all of its moments  must be an admissible characteristic functional for a pair of classical stochastic processes .",
    "then , via sec",
    ".  [ semiclvsquantum ] , the zero - mean jointly gaussian state is representable as a classical statistical mixture of @xmath87 and @xmath88 s coherent states ( whose sample functions constitute the eigenfunctions of the coherent states , and the probability density of their occurrence constitutes the mixture - weights of these coherent states ) , viz . , the joint state has a proper @xmath45-representation .",
    "the distinction between auto- and cross - correlation propagation is irrelevant here , because both the signal and reference beams undergo identical transformations .",
    "thus , even though we state our results only for the cross - correlation functions , these results also apply to auto - correlation propagation ."
