    "laser cooling is one of attractive subjects of modern physics .",
    "it has been demonstrated with several experimental techniques such as the ion cooling @xcite , the doppler cooling @xcite , the sisyphus cooling @xcite , etc .",
    "also it has enabled us to observe many fundamental phenomena in theoretical physics .",
    "one of typical instances of applications of the laser cooling is the observation of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "it has been about ten years since another type of laser cooling was proposed using the strong atom - photon interaction .",
    "such a strong interaction between atom and photons is realized in the so - called cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the group of ritsch has investigated the system of a two - level atom coupled with a laser , and then , they have found a mechanism for cooling the atom @xcite , which is similar to that of the sisyphus cooling .",
    "the cooling mechanism is called _ cavity - induced atom cooling_. in the process of their cavity - induced atom cooling , the method to carry away the energy from the atom coupled with photons is given not only by atomic decay ( i.e. , atomic spontaneous emission of photons ) but also by cavity decay .",
    "it has experimentally been confirmed that the cavity decay works in the cooling system @xcite .",
    "concerning the cooling methods using cavity qed , domokos and ritsch proposed a concept of superradiant cooling @xcite based on the atomic self - organization and cooperation among many atoms in a cavity @xcite .",
    "the atom - photon interaction in the strong coupling regime brings the situation amazingly different from ordinary atomic decay @xcite",
    ". we will adopt this difference into our arguments on the cavity - induced atom cooling .",
    "as well as the ensemble of many two - level atoms coupled with a laser has the possibility of making superradiance as a cooperative effect in optics @xcite , another superradiance may also appear in energy spectrum even for the system of a two - level atom coupled with a laser , provided that it is in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "as far as atom - laser interaction in the cooling process for the bose - einstein condensation goes , a superradiance has been experimentally observed under a certain physical condition @xcite , and this phenomenon has been theoretically shown @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that there is a possibility that superradiance causes the energy level crossing between the initial ground state energy and an initial excited state energy @xcite , namely , a kind of phase transition occurs .",
    "this is an optical phenomenon of light - induced phase transitions though it is not a cooperative effect in optics .",
    "the details of such an energy level crossing has precisely been studied , and then , this type of crossing is called the _ dicke - type _ ( _ energy level _ ) _ crossing _ @xcite .",
    "we will strictly define its meaning in sec.[sec : hamiltonian ] .",
    "the reason why we call the energy level crossing so is that it is basically caused by the mathematical mechanism @xcite of dicke s superradiance @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to developing the cavity - induced atom cooling .",
    "namely , we will show that the dicke - type energy level crossings take place when the system undergoes changes between the weak coupling regime and the strong one . using the crossings",
    ", we will propose a possibility of another superradiant cooling in terms of the energy spectrum from our point of view . in our proposal we will consider whether the followings are possible in theory for cooling the atom in a cavity : 1 )",
    "can we use a laser only for controlling the strength of the atom - cavity interaction without throwing another laser to the atom for driving it to an excited state ?",
    "2 ) can we expect that the energy loss caused by cavity decay becomes much larger ? to perform our research into the problems , we consider an ideal situation only to see the energy - spectral property for our system without considering , for example , the laser heating processes caused by diffusion of the atomic momentum . some mathematical technique to make the spectral analysis for such systems have been developed lately @xcite .",
    "thus , another purpose of this paper is to show the mechanism of the dicke - type energy level crossing in the cavity - induced atom cooling as rigorously as in the works in ref . so that the process of our superradiant cooling can function well in ( mathematical ) theory .",
    "our paper is constructed in the following . in sec.[sec : hamiltonian ] we will generalize the hamiltonian @xmath0 which ritsch s group handled , where @xmath1 is a function of space - time point and governs the atom - photon interaction , @xmath2 also a function of space - time and a generalization of the strength of the pump field , and @xmath3 a parameter for non - linear coupling of the atom and photons .",
    "moreover , we will define some notion to explain what the dicke - type energy level crossing is .",
    "we will make energy - spectral analysis for the generalized hamiltonian @xmath0 in and after sec.[sec : dicke - type - crossing ] . in sec.[sec : dicke - type - crossing ] we will show that the dicke - type energy level crossings take place for @xmath0 with @xmath4 . in sec.[sec :",
    "sgse ] we will show the existence of the superradiant ground state energy for @xmath0 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the strong coupling regime . in sec.[sec :",
    "stability ] we will argue the stability of the dicke - type energy level crossing under the condition @xmath6 .",
    "in ref . the group of ritsch studied a hamiltonian adopting dipole and rotating wave approximation . to write down their hamiltonian , we define some operators : the atomic position ( resp .",
    "momentum ) operator is denoted by @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) , the photon annihilation ( resp . creation ) operator by @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) , and the atomic operator is given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian is @xmath13 where two real numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the atom - pump detuning and the detuning of the empty cavity relative to the pump frequency , and @xmath18 stands for the atom - cavity coupling constant , i.e. , @xmath19 with the position @xmath7 of the atom and the wave number @xmath20 of photons of the laser .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath21 the hamiltonian @xmath22 is used to argue the resonant interaction of an atom with a microwave field @xcite . in hamiltonian @xmath22 , the part consisting of the first , the second , and the third terms ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) is the free hamiltonian of our system .",
    "each of the fourth and fifth terms represents the hamiltonian of interaction and the energy operator of the pump field respectively . in this section",
    "we generalize the above hamiltonian .",
    "our generalization is the following : ( 1 ) we consider not only the linear coupling but also non - linear coupling ; ( 2 ) we introduce the time - dependence into the coupling constant @xmath18 ; ( 3 ) we consider the general operator which represents not only the energy operator of the pump field but also , for instance , the energy operator of the pump field plus some error potential coming from the environment of the experiment for testing the system .",
    "thus our hamiltonian reads @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are continuous , real - valued functions of @xmath28 with @xmath29 for every position @xmath7 of the atom , and @xmath30 is the generalization of the energy operator of the pump field . as an example of @xmath26 , we often adopt @xmath31 in this paper . here",
    "@xmath32 is a continuous , real - valued function of time @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and @xmath35 a bounded , continuous , real - valued function of the position @xmath7 of the atom . for instance , @xmath36 .    in the case",
    "where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we denote eigenvalues of @xmath39 by @xmath40 . when either @xmath26 or @xmath41 is alive , we denote eigenvalues of @xmath0 by @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "if the interaction @xmath44 is a small perturbation for h(0,0;d ) , then each eigenvalue @xmath42 sits near its original position @xmath45 , so that the primary order among eigenvalues is kept : @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transition of the superradiance @xcite tells us about a possibility that @xmath47 is less than @xmath48 and thus becomes a new ground state energy provided that the interaction @xmath49 has some strong strength . for our hamiltonian , we can classify crossings into two types .",
    "one type is the crossing between an ascending eigenvalue @xmath50 and a descending one @xmath51 as the strength of the interaction @xmath52 grows enough .",
    "another type is the crossing only among descending eigenvalues @xmath51 ( or ascending eigenvalues @xmath50 ) .",
    "we call the former type a _ trivial _ crossing , and the latter type a _ non - trivial _ crossing . for the non - trivial crossing , as the strength of the interaction becomes much stronger , even many @xmath51s may be less than @xmath53 .",
    "we call such a non - trivial crossing the dicke - type ( energy level ) crossing @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath51s are capable of usurping the position of the ground state energy in turn .",
    "we call such a new ground state energy the _ superradiant ground state energy_. the dicke - type energy level crossings and the appearance of the superradiant ground state energy can be used , together with cavity decay , for carrying away the energy from the system .",
    "based on this idea , we construct mathematical foundations of the concept of superradiant cooling different from that proposed in ref . in and after the next section .",
    "in this section we show how the dicke - type energy level crossing takes place for @xmath54 , that is , for @xmath0 in the case where @xmath55 . as in ref . using the well - known identification so that the ground state @xmath56 with the energy @xmath57 and the @xmath58st excited state @xmath59 with the energy @xmath60 are unitarily equivalent to @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , @xmath54 approximately reads @xmath63 here we note @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . in their paper",
    "we always assume that @xmath68 therefore , the ground state energy of @xmath69 ( i.e. , @xmath70 with @xmath71 ) is always @xmath57 .    as shown in sec.[sec : appendix ] with the method which is a generalization of that in refs . and , since @xmath70 is basically the hamiltonian of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , all the energy levels of @xmath70 are perfectly determined .",
    "they are given by @xmath72 for non - negative integer @xmath73 with @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for non - negative integer @xmath73 with @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the generalized rabi frequency @xcite : @xmath79 here we note all the energy levels of @xmath69 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the energy levels of @xmath70 are completely given by energies @xmath83 and energies @xmath84 of the generalized jaynes - cummings doublet @xcite , continuous functions of @xmath85 , for each @xmath43 : for non - negative integers @xmath73 with @xmath74 @xmath86 for non - negative integers @xmath73 with @xmath76 , on the other hand , @xmath87 and @xmath88 it follows from these definitions that @xmath89 and @xmath90 the later inequality means that the candidates of superradiant ground state energy are only @xmath91s .",
    "we define two spatiotemporal domains @xmath92 and @xmath93 for non - negative integers @xmath94 and @xmath73 with @xmath95 as @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the behavior of the dicke - type energy level crossings in the case @xmath5 . to do that",
    ", we introduce some positive numbers and some domains of the space - time .",
    "then , we divide the whole space of the space - time into three classes , namely , the weak coupling regime , the strong coupling regime , and the critical regime :    for each natural number @xmath73 , we define a positive number @xmath98 by @xmath99 we define three domains @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 of the space - time as follows : the spatiotemporal domain @xmath103 for the weak coupling regime is given by @xmath104 , and the domain @xmath105 for the strong coupling regime by @xmath106 . the domain @xmath107 for the critical regime is defined by @xmath108 .",
    "the following theorem says that how the dicke - type energy level crossing takes place is completely determined : _ let us suppose @xmath109 now .",
    "then , the spatiotemporal domain @xmath100 is equal to the domain @xmath110 , and the spatiotemporal domain @xmath101 to the domain @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "@xmath114 these inequalities ( [ eq : before - dc0])([eq : after - dc0 ] ) guarantee the dicke - type energy level crossing because @xmath115 and @xmath116 are continuous functions of the space - time point @xmath85 .",
    "when the above dicke - type energy level crossing between @xmath115 and @xmath116 takes place , there is certainly an energy level crossing between @xmath117 and @xmath116 for a natural number @xmath94 with @xmath118 . to show it ,",
    "we introduce two positive constants and define two domains of the space - time :    for natural numbers @xmath119 with @xmath120 , we set positive constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 as @xmath123 and @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "we give two spatiotemporal domains @xmath126 and @xmath127 for non - negative integers @xmath119 with @xmath120 in the following : the domain @xmath126 for the weak coupling regime is given by @xmath128 , and the domain @xmath127 for the strong coupling regime by @xmath129 .",
    "then , as far as such @xmath94 goes , the following theorem gives a sufficient condition so that the crossing between @xmath117 and @xmath116 occurs : _ let @xmath118 now .",

    "but , before proving them , we concretely see some physical situation that they tell us .",
    "we employ @xmath137 as @xmath138 . for the position fixed at @xmath139 , the five energies @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 ,",

    "let our atom be in the state with the energy @xmath147 at an initial space - time point @xmath148 in the domain @xmath126 for a non - negative integer @xmath94 and a positive integer @xmath73 with @xmath149 .",
    "the atom is apt to sit in the state with energy @xmath147 because being in the state with energy @xmath147 is more stable than in the state with energy @xmath150 .",
    "once , however , a space - time point @xmath85 plunges into the domain @xmath127 , the energy level crossing takes place as shown in its process ( [ eq : before - dc0])([eq : after - dc0 ] ) .",

    "this descent can be caused by cavity decay even if we can not expect atomic decay as pointed out in ref .. the circumstance for such a cooling is usually not in thermal equilibrium , and thus , the temperature which this system loses is not given by thermodynamic temperature . nevertheless , according to the thermodynamics low as in eq.(5.1 ) of ref . and",
    "eq.(2.1 ) of ref .",
    ", we roughly estimate the effective temperature @xmath151 coming from the descent .",

    "@xmath153 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath154 the generalized rabi frequency ( [ eq : grf ] ) for each natural number @xmath155 .",
    "conversely , let our atom be in the state with the energy @xmath150 at an initial space - time point @xmath148 in the domain @xmath127 . then , since a process reverse to the above energy level crossing takes place if the coupling regime recoils from the spatiotemporal domain @xmath127 to the domain @xmath126 , this reverse crossing can also carry away the temperature @xmath156 of the atom so that @xmath157 for the point @xmath148 in the spatiotemporal domain @xmath127 and the point @xmath85 in the domain @xmath126 .",

    "the diagrammatic illustration about temperature loss is represented by the thick arrows in fig.[fig : superradiant - mn - pra ] .",
    "therefore , our arguments say that there is a possibility of the following mechanism for superradiant cooling : let a space - time point @xmath159 be in the domain @xmath160 and a space - time point @xmath161 in the domain @xmath162 , respectively , for each @xmath163 with a natural number @xmath164 .",

    "namely , we do not have to throw the driving laser to the atom in the cavity for its excitement .",
    "we note this type emission comes from a kind of superradiance @xcite .",
