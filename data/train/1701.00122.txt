    "the spin - boson model is one of the most prominent models used to study dissipative and decoherence effects in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it describes a two - state system ( tss ) coupled to an infinite array of non - interacting harmonic oscillators whose effect on the system is characterized by spectral density @xmath0 . the spin - boson model with a power law spectral density , which is the general setting of the model , contains only the cutoff frequency of the bath as an internal energy scale and leads to scale - free - rates while the so - called structured environments provide a more non - trivial internal dynamics which might be relevant for controlling coherence and relaxation times by engineering a properly structured environment  @xcite .",
    "garg , onuchic and ambegaokar ( goa ) have shown that the spin - boson model with ohmic spectral density can be mapped to the problem of a tss interacting with a harmonic oscillator which is damped by an ohmic environment whose effective spectral function can be approximated as lorentzian when the cutoff frequency of the ohmic bath is much larger than the characteristic frequency of the harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "the goa model has been used to in many studies to describe several phenomena such as electron transfer reactions in various condensed phase environments . the same hamiltonian and @xmath0 , also , describe experimentally relevant quantum systems , such as flux - qubit read out by a dc - squid  @xcite , atom - based cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , circuit quantum electrodynamics with superconducting systems  @xcite , semiconducting quantum dots in nano - cavities  @xcite and in nano - mechanical resonators  @xcite .",
    "the same model is employed in chemical physics context to study charge transfer  @xcite , energy transfer dynamics in photosynthesis  @xcite and linear and nonlinear spectroscopies  @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches used to investigate the dynamics of the coupled tss - damped harmonic oscillator(ho ) system can be , broadly , divided into two groups ; on the one hand , the infinite dimensional tss - ho hamiltonian is approximated by a finite dimensional system which is reduced to jaynes - cummings or ac - stark hamiltonian depending on whether one is in the resonant or dispersive regime  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problem could be considered as a spin - boson model with a peaked spectral density .",
    "a large number of computational techniques have been developed to investigate the dynamics of spin - boson model , such as hierarchical equations of motion , renormalization group techniques and path integral based formalism  @xcite .",
    "the effects of structured spectral density on the decoherence properties of a qubit have been studied with a perturbative approach in refs .",
    "thorwart _ et . al .",
    "_ have used ab initio quapi technique to show that perturbative treatment breaks down when qubit - ho coupling is strong ( @xmath1 ) and when the qubit and the oscillator frequencies are comparable  @xcite .",
    "gan , huang and zheng have studied the dynamics of the spin - boson model by using a unitary transformation method  @xcite while ref .",
    "@xcite has investigated the dephasing times for the tss - ho system by using flow - equations renormalization method and shown that harmonic oscillator frequency can be used to control qubit dynamics .    as the interaction between the tss and its environment , whether a bath of non - interacting harmonic oscillator or the damped harmonic oscillator , is considered to be linear , the spectral density function @xmath0 and the bath temperature completely characterizes the tss - bath coupling .",
    "all relevant computational techniques make use of bath correlation function @xmath2 which is the thermal average of the force auto - correlation of the bath degrees of freedoms or its two - times integrated form to account for the effect of the bath .",
    "so , obtaining manageable analytical expressions for @xmath2 might be beneficial for theoretical as well as computational techniques used to treat the spin - boson problem .",
    "there has been a number of reports on the analytical expressions for correlation functions of peaked spectral density  @xcite .",
    "nesi , grifoni and paladino have studied the dynamics of the system for the large q - factor oscillator at arbitrary detuning and finite temperatures and obtained analytical expressions for the tss population  @xcite for the weak - coupling regime .",
    "building on the findings of ref  @xcite , vierheilig , bercioux and grifoni have considered the dynamics of a qubit coupled to a nonlinear oscillator which is coupled to an ohmic bath and showed that the system can be mapped to the tss - damped harmonic oscillator model with an effective peaked spectral density  @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "our first aim is to obtain an exact analytical expression for the correlation function @xmath2 of tss - ho system which is characterized by a peaked spectral density .",
    "the tss - ho system has several characteristic times set by the energy splitting and tunneling amplitude of the tss , frequency and the damping of the harmonic oscillator , the temperature of the hos environment and the coupling constant between the ho and the tss .",
    "the complicated interplay among these rate constants make it difficult to develop a universal computational technique which is applicable for all parameter values . using the derived @xmath2 expression ,",
    "we investigate the population dynamics of the tss and map the validity range of various approximations as function of tss tunneling splitting , coupling strength between the tss and the harmonic oscillator , damping of the oscillator and the temperature of the bath .",
    "it is found that for a range of parameters , one can use markov approximation and obtain an exact expression for the population difference .",
    "the outline of the paper is follows : in section  [ model ] , we describe the problem and derive the expression for @xmath2 and present several approximations to it .",
    "the validity range of the approximations are discussed in section  [ discuss ] and a brief summary of the study is presented in the conclusions .",
    "let the total hamiltonian of the closed system be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the splitting of the energy levels of the system , @xmath5 is the tunneling matrix element and @xmath6 are the pauli spin matrices .",
