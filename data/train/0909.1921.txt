    "low - mass stars constitute the majority of stars by number in our galaxy . since their lower masses with respect to the sun they have also very low intrinsic brightness . although the intrinsic faintness of these stars many low - luminosity stars were discovered particularly by the near - infrared sky surveys : deep near infrared survey ( delfosse et al . 1997 ) , two micron all sky survey ( skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) , sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 ) , northern sky variability survey ( wozniak et al .",
    "since their main - sequence lifetimes are considerably longer than the age of the universe both the young and old low - mass stars are located on the lower right part of the the hr diagram .",
    "low - mass stars surround many important regions of stellar parameter space which include the onset of complete convection in the stellar interior , the onset of electron degeneracy in the core , and the formation of dust and depletion metals onto dust grains in the stellar atmosphere ( west et al .",
    "recent studies have shown that while the observed radii of the low - mass stars are significantly larger than those predicted by current stellar models , in contrast their effective temperatures are cooler ( ribas et al .",
    "2008 , lopez - morales and ribas 2005 ) .",
    "chabrier , gallardo & baraffe ( 2007 ) have put forward the hypothesis that the observed radius and temperature discrepancies are consequences of the convection due to rotation and/or magnetic field and the presence of large surface magnetic spots . therefore low - mass stars are key interest in studies of both formation of the stars in star - forming regions and comparison their parameters with those predicted from theoretical stellar models .    the fundamental parameters such as mass , radius , effective temperature and luminosity , all in a distance - independent manner , of a star could be determined empirically from eclipsing binary stars .",
    "precise masses and radii can be determined from multi - wavelength photometry and spectroscopy , obtained with current technology , of double - lined close binary systems .",
    "however , the number of well - studied eclipsing binaries with low - mass components is rather small because of their low intrinsic brightness .",
    "furthermore , most of their light curves are undergone strong distortion due to magnetic activity .",
    "therefore , multi - passband photometric and spectroscopic observations of additional low - mass binaries would be extremely useful .",
    "the binary nature of the star known as nsvs 06507557 ( = 2mass j01582387 + 2521196 , hereafter nsvs 0650 ) was discovered by shaw and lopez - morales ( 2006 ) using the database nsvs ( wozniak et al .",
    "the eclipse period was determined to be 0.515 d. later on the first vri light curves and preliminary models are presented by coughlin and shaw ( 2007 ) .",
    "taking the bvri magnitudes from the usno nomad catalog and jhk from 2mass catalog they estimated the effective temperature of 3860 k for the primary , corresponding to a spectral type of m0v .",
    "as they have noted a difficulty encountered in modeling was the high - level spot activity of the components .",
    "not only the radii and effective temperatures of the component stars were determined but also the rough masses estimated by them .",
    "we have conducted a photometric and spectroscopic monitoring program of several low - mass eclipsing binaries . in this paper",
    "we present , the results of multi - wavelength optical photometry and spectroscopy for double - lined eclipsing binary nsvs 0650 .",
    "nsvs0650757 was first identified in the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; wozniak et al .",
    "2004 ) as a detached eclipsing binary system with a maximum , out - of - eclipse v - bandpass magnitude @xmath4=13@xmath0.05 and a period of p=0.51509 day . the data from the nsvs , obtained with the robotic optical transient search experiment telescopes ( rotse ) , contains positions , light curves and v magnitudes for about 14 million objects ranging in magnitudes from 8 to 15.5 .",
    "the b , v , r , and i magnitudes for nsvs 0650 were listed in the usno nomad catalog as ( naval observatory merged astronomical dataset , nomad-1.0 , zacharias et al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath5=14@xmath0.53 , @xmath4=13@xmath0.37 , @xmath6=12@xmath0.47 ; on the other hand the infra - red magnitudes in three bandpasses were given as @xmath7=10@xmath0.918 @xmath8=10@xmath0.267 , and @xmath9=10@xmath0.092 in the 2mass catalog ( cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the nsvs survey ,",
    "262 v - bandpass measurements of the variable were obtained during the period june 1999 - march 2000 with a median sampling rate of 0.25@xmath10 .",
    "the resulting light curve exhibits periodic eclipses with a depth of @xmath110@xmath0.7 in the deeper eclipse and the mean standard deviation in the out - of - eclipse phases was about 0@xmath0.073 .",
    "the photometric observations of nsvs 0650 were carried out with the 0.4 m telescope at the ege university observatory .",
    "the 0.4 m telescope equipped with an apogee 1kx1k ccd camera and standard bessel vri bandpasses .",
    "the observations were performed on seven nights between september 01 and november 30 , 2008 . to get the higher accuracy the target nsvs0650",
    "was placed near to the center of the ccd and three nearby stars located on the same frame were taken for comparison .",
    "the stars gsc 01760 - 01860 and usno a2.0 1125  638990 were selected as comparison and check , respectively .",
    "therefore the target and comparison stars could be observed simultaneously with an exposure time of 10 seconds .",
    "since the variable is very cool , red star the signal - to - noise ratio was highest in i- and lowest in the v - bandpass .",
    "the differential observations of the comparison stars showed that they are stable during time span of our observations .",
    "the data were processed with standard data reduction procedures including bias and over scan subtraction , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry .",
    "a total of 743 , 812 and 612 photometric measurements were obtained in each v , r and i bandpasses , respectively .",
    "the average uncertainity of each differential measurement was less than 0@xmath0.030 .",
    "the v- , r- and i - bandpass magnitude differences , in the sense of variable minus comparison , are listed in table 1 ( available in the electronic form at the cds ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + _ 2mass _ all - sky point source catalogue ( cutri et al .",

    "one of the goals of the present study is to derive the physical parameters of the low - mass stars in the eclipsing binary systems .",
    "as it is known eclipsing binaries are the most suitable laboratories for determining the fundamental properties of the stars and thus for testing the predictions of theoretical models . for this reason we started optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of some selected low - mass stars .",
    "we obtained multi - band light curves and spectra with a wide wavelength range .",
    "we analyzed the v- , r- , and i - bandpass light curves and the radial velocities separately using the modern codes .",
    "then , we combined the photometric and spectroscopic solutions and derived the absolute parameters of the component stars .",
    "the standard deviations of the parameters have been determined by jktabsdimjkt / codes.html ] code , which calculates distance and other physical parameters using several different sources of bolometric corrections ( southworth et al .",
    "the best fitting parameters are listed in table 5 together with their formal standard deviations .",
    "the luminosity and absolute bolometric magnitudes m@xmath12 of the stars were computed from their effective temperatures and their radii . since low - mass stars radiates more energy at the longer wavelengths we used @xmath13 magnitudes given by coughlin & shaw ( 2007 ) . applying @xmath14 magnitudes - t@xmath15 relations given by girardi ( 2002 ) we calculated the distance to nsvs0650 as @xmath16=111@xmath19 pc .",
    "estimating distances to low - mass stars are strongly depended on the bolometric corrections .",
    "if we adopt the bolometric corrections given by siess , forrestini & dougados ( 1997 ) the distance to nsvs 0650 reduces to about @xmath16=86@xmath14 pc .",
    "the mean light contribution of the secondary star @xmath17/(@xmath18+@xmath17)=0.22 obtained directly from the i - bandpass light curve analysis is in a good agreement with that estimated from the bolometric luminosities as 0.22 .",
    "this result indicates that the light contribution of the less massive component is very small , indicating its effect on the color at outsite eclipse is very limited .",
    "locations of the primary and secondary components on the theoretical mass - radius and t@xmath15 - log l / l@xmath19 diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the mass tracks and isochrones are adopted from siess , forrestini & dougados ( 1997 ) and siess ( 2000 ) .",
    "since the stars appear to be in pre - main sequence evolution we adopted z=0.03 .",
    "these mass tracks are very close to those obtained for solar abundance .",
    "the radius of more massive primary component is in agreement with that zero - age main sequence star having the same mass .",
    "however , the secondary is about 35 % larger than the main - sequence counterpart .",
    "this result confirm the hypothesis proposed by chabrier , gallardo & baraffe ( 2007 ) for the larger radius of the low - mass convective stars .",
    "the existence of li 6708    absorption line in the spectra and comparison the absolute dimensions of the components with the evolutionary tracks may be taken as an indicator of the pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the components of nsvs0650 lie on the isochrones between 15 - 30 myr , still in contracting phase toward the main - sequence .",
    "if we use the isochrones plotted m@xmath20 versus @xmath21 we estimate an age of about 10 - 15 myr .",
    "this difference arises from the bolometric corretions given by siess , forrestini & dougados ( 1997 ) .",
    "we used the color - temperature calibrations given for the main - sequence stars for estimating the effective temperature of the more massive primary component .",
    "if we use the color - temperature relation given for luminosity class iv stars ( de jager and nieuwenhuijzen , 1987 ) we find even smaller effective temperature af about 3700 k for the primary component .",
    "the difference of about 250 k in the effective temperature of the primary star shifts its location to the lower - right in the hr diagram which corresponds to a smaller age .",
    "we estimate an age of about 50 myr using the pre - main - sequence models given by dantona & mazzetelli ( 1997 ) , and 63 myr by baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) slightly larger than that given by siess et al . model .",
    "the evolutionary models indicate that a star with a mass of 0.66   takes about 100 myr to contract and reach its normal main - sequence radius .",
    "the lii 6708    line is often used an age indicator . in the spectra of nsvs0650 the lii line",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "moreover , in the optical spectrum of the system , we observed also h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lines as in emission .",
    "in addition , strong emission of the [ oi ] forbidden line is visible .",
    "these features are signs of ctts but , in contrary , the measured ew values point a wtts .",
    "the primary component of nsvs0650 appears in the region of @xmath22 stars located on the hr diagram ( see fig . 8 in sestito , palla & randich , 2008 ) .",
    "the measured ew of 0.3    for lii is in agreement with this classification .",
    "high - resolution spectra are urgently required to confirm our finding and to derive which sub - group , ctts or wtts , it belongs .",
    "the authors acknowledge generous allotments of observing time at tubitak national observatory ( tug ) of turkey . we also wish to thank the turkish scientific and technical research council for supporting this work through grant nr . 108t210 and ebiltem ege university science foundation project no:08/bil/0.27 .",
