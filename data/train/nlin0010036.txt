    "in a historical numerical experiment fermi pasta and ulam @xcite studied the following non - linear model of a 1d crystal described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 contrary to initial expectations of fermi _ et al _ the so - called fpu model ( [ dimh ] ) behaved in a strong contrast to the ergodic theorem of statistical mechanics , even in quite strongly non - linear regime when one would expect fast relaxation to statistical canonical equilibrium and equipartition of energy from an arbitrary initial state .",
    "instead , fpu model triggered the discovery of non - linear normal modes , the so - called _ solitons _ , and indirectly , the whole field of ( computational ) non - linear dynamics .",
    "later , fpu chain has been studied in the spirit of kam theory @xcite and various estimates have been given for the critical strength of the dimensionless non - linearity parameter @xmath2 required for the motion to become globally stochastic @xcite .",
    "recently , fpu - type models have been studied in the context of energy transport and fourier heat law in 1d chains of particles @xcite .",
    "quite unexpectedly , fpu - type models , namely hamiltonians of the type ( [ dimh ] ) with non - linear inter - particle interaction @xmath3 ( and no _ on - site _ potential ) , turned out to be anomalous heat conductors , due to slow power law decay of transport ( velocity - velocity or current - current ) time correlation functions .",
    "these results , namely that correlations decay universally as @xmath4 , and correspondingly that kubo transport coefficient diverges as @xmath5 as a function of the chain length @xmath6 , have later been successfully explained in terms of hydrodynamic arguments and mode - mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "however , a perturbative - like approach such as mode - mode coupling theory should break down when the inter - particle potential has _",
    "more than one _ stable position . indeed ,",
    "et al _ @xcite have performed a series of numerical experiments on the particle chain with an oscillating inter - particle potential @xmath7 , as well as with the potential @xmath8 , and found normal heat conduction with a clean exponential decay of correlations .",
    "the key mechanism , which we believe produces non - kam - like ( almost ) hyperbolic motion of such a high dimensional hamiltonian system , are the hyperbolic saddles over which pairs of particles flip from one well to another .",
    "this motivated us to study in this paper some fundamental dynamical properties of the simplest version of such a hyperbolic chain with quartic double - well inter - particle potential @xmath3 .",
    "we present here some intriguing numerical results which suggest existence of a simple ( but only approximate ) markov partition with very simple many - body symbolic dynamics of this particle chain .",
    "in addition , we find that the transition matrix is formally generated by a hamiltonian of a certain quantum spin-1/2 chain .",
    "section [ secifpu ] introduces the model . in section [ secamp ]",
    "we define ( approximate markov ) partition of phase space and obtain numerical and analytical estimates for the volumes of various cells . expression for the average time between subsequent jumps among the cells is also obtained . in section [ secmarkov ]",
    "we introduce markovian description of our model with the transition matrix and the flux matrix and numerically check the accuracy of the markovian property in two independent ways .",
    "section [ secf ] represents the core of the present paper .",
    "we numerically calculate the transition matrix and make a formal correspondence between our model and a ferromagnetic heisenberg quantum spin-@xmath0 chain . using this correspondence",
    "we derive various estimates and bounds for the decay rates of the time correlation functions of a class of piece - wise constant functions .",
    "with the choice for units of mass , time and length of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and the new canonical coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , hamiltonian ( [ dimh ] ) can be brought to a dimensionless form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the only dimensionless parameter left . in order for the potential minima to be at level 0 ( for @xmath16 )",
    "we have added a constant term @xmath17 to the potential @xmath3 .",
    "we can get all different orbits of the system described by the hamilton function ( [ afpu ] ) just by varying one parameter @xmath18 .",
    "at first it would seem that the energy @xmath19 is also a free parameter .",
    "but by fixing all the three basic units we have also provided a natural unit for the energy density @xmath20 .",
    "if we scale the dimensionless quantities by a factor @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 , the hamiltonian is simply multiplied by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "invariant parameter in this transformation is therefore @xmath24 .",
    "all different nonequivalent hamiltonians can be obtained just by varying one parameter , namely @xmath25 , or equivalently @xmath18 at fixed @xmath26 .",
    "energy density can therefore be fixed without any loss of generality . from now on @xmath27 is assumed , as well as periodic boundary conditions @xmath28 .",
    "phase space point will be denoted by @xmath29 . for negative values of the parameter @xmath18 the system has a form of the standard @xmath30-fpu model ( just in a different parametrization ) , but in this paper we focus on the positive values of the parameter @xmath18 in which case we call the system _ inverted fpu model _ ( ifpu ) .",
    "ifpu model is translationally invariant , therefore besides the energy @xmath26 there is also a second ( trivial ) constant of motion , namely the total momentum @xmath31 . in all numerical calculations",
    "the total momentum has been fixed to @xmath32 .    for the numerical integration of equations of motion a fourth order symplectic algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite has been used .",
    "this integrator has been checked to be the optimal choice ( at least for the model studied here , and at relative accuracy @xmath33 ) by making a careful comparison with a number of other symplectic and runge - kutta methods .",
    "if the barrier @xmath34 between the potential minima is sufficiently high the differences @xmath35 will spend most of the time either around the left or the right minimum , with quite infrequent jumps between the wells . as the motion around the minimum is approximately harmonic the more interesting part will be the transitions between the left and the right potential well , for each pair of neighboring particles , going over the hyperbolic saddle at @xmath36 .",
    "understanding the motion in phase space of a high - dimensional system is generally very difficult .",
    "some symbolic description of an orbit @xmath37 is therefore highly desirable . in ifpu model with high potential barrier",
    "the choice of a partition of phase space is almost obvious :    for each instant of time @xmath38 we will be interested only in a single binary bit of information @xmath39 for each pair of neighboring particles @xmath40 , namely if the neighbors are in the right or left well , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , we write @xmath43 or @xmath44 , respectively . binary positions for the whole chain can be compactly encoded in a binary integer ( _ signature _ ) @xmath45 thus we have defined a partition of @xmath46-dimensional phase space cut by @xmath47 hyper - planes @xmath48 into @xmath49 cells labeled by signatures @xmath50 . by a slight abuse of language , we will use a term _ signature _ @xmath51 also to refer to a phase space cell denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "if the transitions between various signatures are rare , which is obviously the case if the potential barrier @xmath52 is high , it seems to be meaningful to concentrate on the ( statistical ) dynamics of transitions between the signatures . for the periodic boundary conditions the coordinate differences must fulfill the constraint @xmath53 which in the limit of infinitely high potential barrier and even @xmath47 translates into the condition @xmath54 . for odd",
    "@xmath47 the number of pairs in the left and the right well should differ by 1 .",
    "this presents only unnecessary technical complications and from now on we will assume @xmath47 to be even",
    ". if the barrier is finite , signatures with different number of pairs in the left and right well are possible to visit .",
    "we will call signature @xmath51 to be of order @xmath55 if @xmath56 .",
    "the number of different signatures @xmath57 of order @xmath55 is @xmath58 for sufficiently high barrier the system will spend most of its time in signatures of order @xmath59 .",
    "we will specifically concentrate on signatures of order 0 and treat signatures of higher ( mostly 1st ) order only as tunnels for transitions between different signatures of order 0 .",
    "figure [ slikaq ] shows an example of a transition between two order 0 signatures via an intermediate short lived signature of order 1 .",
    "first we have to know for which values of parameter @xmath18 and size @xmath47 will the description by the signatures of order 0 only be adequate , i.e. will the relative time spent in higher order signatures be negligible .",
    "we will now make a rough theoretical estimate for the time spent in signatures of different orders .",
    "for an ergodic system this time is proportional to the measure ( volume ) of the phase space covered with the signatures in question .",
    "let us designate by @xmath60 the time spent in signatures of order @xmath55 .",
    "we have @xmath61 where the region of integration is the part of the energy surface @xmath62 intersecting with the full set of signatures of order @xmath55 and @xmath63 is the total volume of the phase space in the signatures of order @xmath55 and with energy less than @xmath19 .",
    "first , let us make an estimate for @xmath64 .",
    "potential around both minima is to the lowest order harmonic , therefore we can roughly say @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the volume for one harmonic oscillator , that is @xmath67 . for the signatures of order",
    "@xmath55 the argument is very similar . in this case",
    "there are @xmath68 particles more in one potential well than in the other .",
    "because the trivial condition @xmath53 must still be satisfied , the equilibrium positions of pairs will not be at @xmath69 any more but will be shifted for @xmath70 in order to keep the center of mass of all pairs at 0 .",
    "this gives for the shift @xmath71 and contributes @xmath72 to the energy density , provided the cubic part of the potential is negligible , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "harmonic approximation for the volume @xmath63 can therefore still be used , but now at energy @xmath74 . since we are interested only in the dependences for large @xmath47 we can omit ( cancel ) energy derivatives coming from ( [ td ] ) , so that we have @xmath75 we have fixed @xmath76 so that the relative fraction of signatures of order 1 , @xmath77 , falls exponentially in @xmath78 .",
    "we must stress that the exponential dependence is expected only when @xmath79 and that the overall prefactor in front of an exponential function could still depend on @xmath47 .",
    "this is nicely confirmed by the numerical data in figure [ slikanedo ] .",
    "grouping the signatures by their order is meaningful since members of each group have the same phase space volume and the same minimal potential energy .",
    "the minimal potential energy of order 0 signatures is @xmath80 , of order 1 is @xmath81 and of order @xmath55 is @xmath82 .",
    "the fraction of time spent in higher order signatures is just a power of relative time spent in order 1 signatures , @xmath83 and this can be reduced by increasing @xmath18 .    of course , for the transitions to be possible at all , the barrier height must be smaller than the total energy @xmath19 .",
    "this yields the condition @xmath84 which is just the opposite of the condition to keep the @xmath77 small .",
    "nevertheless , we can still reduce the fraction of higher order states to around @xmath85 , which is small .",
    "but the condition ( [ cond ] ) can be problematic for small @xmath47 .",
    "indeed , for the smallest nontrivial case of @xmath86 we have numerically found that there are no transitions between signatures for @xmath87 . for smaller @xmath18",
    "we do find transitions , but there the system exhibits non - ergodic behaviour . condition ( [ cond ] ) , although fulfilled , seems to be too weak and is still keeping the phase space cut into non - connected parts .",
    "the smallest system worth studying regarding transitions is therefore @xmath88 .    in all numerical work @xmath18 and @xmath47",
    "have been chosen so as to keep the fractional volume of higher order signatures small .",
    "we have therefore studied the dynamics on a set of @xmath89 signatures of order 0 exhibiting transitions thru short - lived order 1 signatures as shown in figure [ slikaq ] .",
    "the most important physical scale that characterizes such a transport is the average time @xmath90 between subsequent transitions .",
    "though the main body of this paper is concerned with the transport and decay of time - correlations , i.e. with the system s mixing property , we should first mention , that we have also checked the weaker dynamical property of ergodicity directly .",
    "we have employed a method of robnik _ et al _ @xcite of comparing the rate of visiting of different phase space cells ( in out case , order 0 signatures ) with the rate for a fully random dynamics . the results turned to be fully consistent with ( uniformly ) ergodic behaviour of our ifpu model in the high - barrier regime discussed above .",
    "now we define the time scale @xmath90 to be an average time from the point when the orbit enters a certain order 0 signature @xmath51 to the point where the same orbit enters the next order 0 signature @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) concluding the transition from @xmath51 to @xmath91 . the average is taken over many different orbits with microcanonically distributed initial conditions , or over one very long orbit if we assume ergodicity .",
    "we obtain an approximate functional form for the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath47 and @xmath18 by similar arguments as for the relative volume of higher order signatures .",
    "the probability for a jump will be estimated by the ratio between the phase space volume of the set of states just before a jump @xmath93 and the volume of the set of equilibrium states @xmath94 .",
    "the approximate volume @xmath95 of the phase space of equilibrium states has been derived in the previous subsection and is just @xmath96 . in the state just before the transitions there should be more than @xmath52 of energy in one pair of particles .",
    "this energy will be denoted by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is for now some unspecified constant .",
    "certainly @xmath98 must be greater than @xmath99 , but because our oscillators are coupled we allow for the possibility that the energy of a pair must actually be bigger than the barrier height .",
    "phase volume @xmath100 for a state with one pair having the energy @xmath101 and the other @xmath102 pairs residing in the minima is @xmath103    probability for a jump is proportional to the quotient of derivatives @xmath104 .",
    "reciprocal average time between transitions @xmath105 is proportional to the above quotient and to the frequency of oscillation around potential minimum .",
    "using also @xmath106 , we finally get @xmath107 where @xmath108 is some overall numerical factor .",
    "we have determined numerical parameters @xmath98 and @xmath108 by fitting the numerical data for different lengths @xmath47 in the range @xmath109 . both parameters",
    "do depend on @xmath47 for small chains , but are , of course , independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , whether the @xmath98 has dependence @xmath112 . in the limit of large chains",
    "@xmath98 has the value @xmath99 predicted by our simple physical picture .",
    "this picture can also be confirmed by looking at the local energy density just before the jump . indeed , local energy of a pair is exactly @xmath101 for all chain sizes .",
    "so , the parameter @xmath98 is not just some fitting parameter in equation ( [ tau ] ) but it has a clear physical interpretation . in figure [ slikatau1 ]",
    "we depict the estimate of @xmath90 ( [ tau ] ) together with the numerical data .",
    "worth noticing is also an interesting scaling law , although only approximate .",
    "global dependence of @xmath113 is such that we can write approximately @xmath114 where @xmath115 is some parameter - free function .",
    "the shape of this function can be seen in figure [ slikaf ] .",
    "we have also numerically computed statistical distribution of transition times @xmath116 , i.e. the time intervals between entering different subsequent signatures of order 0 such that @xmath117 , for a fixed @xmath47 and @xmath18 .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure [ slikatau ] and is clearly seen to be exponential .",
    "there is a discrepancy only for extremely small times .",
    "this is a consequence of the duration of intermediate unstable order 1 state that occurs between order 0 states ( see figure [ slikaq ] ) .",
    "the fraction of order 1 states was in this case @xmath118 which is the same as the time scale of the discrepancy in the figure .",
    "our distribution should be a convolution of distributions of @xmath119 and of @xmath120 .",
    "but the precise explanation of this discrepancy is the following : we obtain too many of `` short '' jumps because of the way we measure the time when the system has arrived into a new order 0 signature .",
    "we mark the system as arriving into a new signature exactly at the top of the barrier , when the difference @xmath121 changes the sign and not when it relaxes to the bottom of the well .",
    "this allows for some ` fake transitions ' in the regions of phase space where two or more 0 order signatures almost touch with a saddle - like region in between ( for instance near coordinate origin @xmath122 ) .",
    "there it is possible that the system , which although it gets over the barrier , subsequently relaxes into some nearby well because it does not have the ` right ' momentum vector .",
    "we decided to describe dynamics with a sequence of binary signatures instead of a full orbit @xmath37 with the hope of some simplification .",
    "we are hence looking for some simple statistical description of the transitions between signatures .",
    "stochastic system is fully described by giving conditional transition probabilities @xmath123 . the simplest kind of a stochastic process is called markov process . for a markov process",
    "the probabilities @xmath124 contain entire information about the system .",
    "we will shortly write a matrix @xmath125 instead of @xmath124 .",
    "for now let us define @xmath124 on the full space of @xmath49 signatures although we will later be interested only in transition probabilities among @xmath89 signatures of order 0 .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath126 must satisfy the condition @xmath127 the matrix @xmath125 contains therefore some redundant information .",
    "we can write instead @xmath128 where for a markov process the matrix @xmath129 is time independent .",
    "the matrix element @xmath130 is a probability flux from the signature @xmath51 to the signature @xmath91 , and can be defined by the limit @xmath131 the conservation of probability imposes the condition @xmath132 for the matrix elements .    by a statistical description ,",
    "using @xmath125 instead of @xmath37 , we lose information about the details within a single cell of a partition . in other words",
    ", we study the dynamics on the space of functions that are constant over one phase space cell .",
    "this can be formalized by introducing characteristic functions @xmath133 over signatures @xmath51 @xmath134 characteristic functions @xmath135 span the space of all observables which are piece - wise constant over the signatures .",
    "every piece - wise constant observable @xmath136 can be expanded over the base functions @xmath135 as @xmath137 with the expansion coefficients @xmath138 given by @xmath139 where the brackets @xmath140 denote a microcanonical phase space average over the energy surface @xmath62 .",
    "the matrix elements of a transition matrix @xmath126 are nothing but the correlation functions between the characteristic functions @xmath141 as the transition matrix propagates the probabilities between the signatures we can write the time dependent vector @xmath142 as @xmath143 similarly , the autocorrelation function of the observable @xmath144 is @xmath145 we can see that the behaviour of correlation functions is determined by the spectrum of the ( markov ) propagator @xmath146 .    from now on",
    "we assume that the fraction of higher order signatures is very small @xmath147 and we restrict the matrices @xmath125 and @xmath129 on the @xmath89-dimensional subspace of signatures of order 0 , which essentially contain all non - vanishing matrix elements .",
    "numerically we calculated the transition matrix @xmath125 from one very long orbit as an average @xmath148 where the brackets @xmath149 denote a time average over the orbit and @xmath150 has value 1 if the orbit is in a signature @xmath51 at time @xmath38 and 0 otherwise .",
    "for small @xmath38 the average can be performed , and by using expression ( [ f ] ) , yields for @xmath130 , @xmath151 @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the number of direct transitions between the order 0 signatures @xmath51 and @xmath91 and @xmath154 is the total time spent in the signature @xmath51 . here",
    "a small comment regarding higher order signatures is in order .",
    "we saw in figure [ slikaq ] that between each order 0 states there is a short intermediate order 1 state of duration @xmath155 .",
    "so there are no direct transitions between order 0 states and all fluxes @xmath130 ( [ fss ] ) among @xmath89 order 0 signatures are strictly zero .",
    "as we have decided to study only ( indirect ) transitions between order 0 states ( for the parameter values where the fraction of higher order states is negligible ) we must somehow circumvent this difficulty .",
    "one solution is to calculate the derivative of the transition matrix @xmath125 in equation ( [ f ] ) not at time @xmath156 but at the time @xmath38 with @xmath157 . in this case",
    "the number @xmath153 in ( [ fss ] ) is the number of jumps between order 0 states @xmath51 and @xmath91 with one short intermediate order 1 state .",
    "still more simple and convenient solution is to replace the orbit @xmath37 by a sequence of times @xmath60 when the orbit hits the boundary of a cell of order 0 coming from outside .",
    "orbit @xmath37 is therefore replaced by a sequence of pairs @xmath158 which tell you that at time @xmath60 orbit @xmath37 came to the order 0 signature @xmath159 , then until time @xmath160 was in signature @xmath159 or any higher order signature and at time @xmath160 arrived into the next order 0 signature @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) , etc .",
    "then we define @xmath153 as the number of subsequent pairs @xmath163 in the sequence @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , hence the flux matrix is calculated as @xmath166 this definition is used in the numerical calculation of this paper .      before describing",
    "the process of transitions as markovian we must check if this is at all permissible . checking the rigorous conditions for the partition to signatures to be markovian , see e.g. @xcite , is a considerable mathematical problem , at least to our judgement . on the other hand , heuristic arguments and numerical results",
    "support the idea , that for sufficiently large transition times @xmath90 the process will indeed be markovian .",
    "the system has positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "vaguely this means that the system quickly `` forgets '' its history .",
    "if the average time between the jumps @xmath90 is longer than the lyapunov time , we can expect transitions to be markovian .",
    "however , the most straightforward test is to check explicitly the composition formula ( [ markov ] ) .",
    "condition @xmath167 is trivially fulfilled for small and for large times @xmath38 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "we checked it for time @xmath170 by calculating the quantity @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the euclidean norm of a matrix @xmath173 ( all results have also been re - checked by using the spectral norm giving almost identical results ) .",
    "as the matrix @xmath125 will be calculated numerically from one very long but finite orbit it will have statistical error @xmath174 due to the finite number of simulated transitions .",
    "in addition , @xmath175 will also have a contribution @xmath176 from a systematic error because the process may not be precisely markovian .",
    "we have assumed @xmath177 and made an estimate for the statistical error @xmath174 as a square root of a number of average transitions per matrix element @xmath178 .",
    "it is @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the total number of all transitions between the signatures of order 0 and @xmath181 is some unspecified numerical constant which has been determined from the numerical data .",
    "its value turned out to be @xmath182 .",
    "results for the dependence of a systematic error @xmath176 are shown in figure [ slikamark ] .",
    "-7 mm    the error @xmath183 goes to zero with increasing @xmath90 , as expected .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that the error also seems to decrease with increasing @xmath47 at constant @xmath90 .",
    "this is interesting as it means that with increasing @xmath47 we do not have to keep the fraction of higher order states small in order for the process to stay markovian .",
    "dimensional space . ]",
    "whether a given system can be described as a markov process can be checked also by calculating the transition matrix @xmath125 and comparing it with the exponential formula ( [ pizf ] ) as a function of time .",
    "@xmath125 can be calculated numerically directly from definition , for instance by using the formula ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "this definition would have a meaning also if the transitions were not markovian .",
    "we then compare the correlation functions between the characteristic functions ( [ pzb ] ) and the matrix elements of the propagator @xmath184 .",
    "these calculations should agree only if the flux matrix @xmath185 were time independent and this would signal that the transitions are described by a markov process . numerical results for this test",
    "are shown in figure [ slikan81 ] .",
    "correlation functions calculated in both ways have been computed for the characteristic function @xmath186 on the signature @xmath187 and for the _ macroscopic observable _ with the vector @xmath188 , i.e. characteristic function on a union of half of all signatures with the first bit @xmath189 , denoted by @xmath190 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the autocorrelation function of the observable @xmath190 begins to fall as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the biggest nontrivial eigenvalue of @xmath129 , very early .",
    "this is a consequence of relatively large overlap between the macroscopic state @xmath190 and the eigenstate @xmath193 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath192 .",
    "we will show in subsection [ dot ] that @xmath194 while @xmath195 , so @xmath196 ( for @xmath197 ) .",
    "something can be said immediately about the spectrum of @xmath129 .",
    "conservation of probability implies all eigenvalues @xmath198 to be smaller or equal to zero .",
    "further , because the system is believed to be ergodic , there should be a non - degenerate constant eigenvector with the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath199 .",
    "this is all the consequence of the perron - frobenius form of the matrix @xmath126 . for finite @xmath47",
    "the spectrum of the flux matrix is discrete and the correlation functions will fall asymptotically as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the largest nonzero eigenvalue .",
    "an interesting question is what happens in the thermodynamic limit @xmath200 .",
    "if there is a spectral gap we will have an exponential decay , otherwise some anomalous behaviour can occur .",
    "non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath129 are expected only between the signatures that differ just by two bits provided that @xmath201 . in other words , two bits @xmath43 and @xmath202 only switch their position .",
    "such a transition will be called a ( bit ) jump of length @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the distance between the two bits involved .",
    "example of a such transition has been shown in figure [ slikaq ] .",
    "we have numerically calculated complete matrices @xmath129 for sizes @xmath205 and @xmath206 and different @xmath90 ( or @xmath18 ) , in order to check the above hypothesis and to obtain some knowledge about the sizes and the structure of matrix elements .",
    "the only matrix elements which are really non - vanishing are those of the bit jumps , and what is more , the value of the matrix element depends only on the distance @xmath203 of the jump and not on the particular signatures involved .",
    "this practically means that in addition to the diagonal elements we have only @xmath207 different matrix elements in the flux matrix @xmath129 .",
    "this number must be compared to the total number of matrix elements @xmath208 which grows exponentially with @xmath47 .",
    "we have checked this also for the matrices @xmath129 of sizes up to @xmath209 but in this case we have compared only the jumps of length @xmath203 with different number of bits 1 on the sites between the two jump sites .",
    "we confirmed that the probability fluxes of jumps depend only on the length @xmath203 .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to introduce dimensionless coefficients @xmath210 which are ratios between the matrix elements of a jump of length @xmath203 and a jump of length @xmath211 .",
    "therefore @xmath212 , by definition , and the rest of @xmath213 coefficients @xmath210 together with the average transition time @xmath90 is all that we need in order to specify the flux matrix @xmath129 completely .",

    "this is not the case , since @xmath229 has a particularly nice and simple form , with non - vanishing elements only between the signatures connected by a bit jump where signatures are sequences of binary bits , 0 and 1 .",
    "this should immediately remind us of heisenberg chains of quantum spin-@xmath0 particles .",

    "can also be deduced that with increasing @xmath90 the spectrum is indeed approaching the spectrum for the @xmath281 ( [ lambdai ] ) , as predicted .",
    "what is more , the eigenvalue @xmath192 seems to be monotonically approaching the limiting case ( @xmath281 ) from above .",
    "we can therefore conclude by observation that the correlation functions of observables which can be spanned by @xmath239 decay slower than @xmath282 .",

    "state vector for @xmath239 has only one component different from 0 .",
    "corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath192 has on the other hand all components approximately of the same order , i.e. @xmath284 .",
    "square of the scalar product is therefore @xmath195 .",
    "one particle state @xmath190 is proportional to the @xmath285 .",

    "state @xmath190 can therefore be written as a sum of @xmath47 states , one of which is also @xmath193 . if we assume all the expansion coefficients to be of the same order we immediately obtain @xmath194 .",
    "we divide the phase space of a @xmath47-body hamiltonian , namely the inverted fpu model , into @xmath49 cells that are uniquely tagged by a binary number , called a signature ( [ sig ] ) .",

    "an approximate markovian description on space spanned by order 0 signatures is possible .",
    "the accuracy of the markovian property has been checked numerically to be increasing with increasing chain length @xmath47 at a constant fraction of higher order states . in the flux matrix @xmath289",

    "there is also a numerical evidence that the largest nontrivial eigenvalue in a general case ( for a non - constant transition rate ) is strictly larger than @xmath291 .",
    "therefore , the correlation functions of the observables which can be spanned by functions @xmath239 decay asymptotically slower than @xmath282 .",
    "unfortunately these results do not imply directly the behaviour of more general correlation functions , such as current - current correlation which is needed in order to understand the transport properties .",
    "we have made some numerical calculations of current - current time correlation functions of ifpu chain for different sizes @xmath47 and different parameters . as expected , the decay of correlations for observables that vary on time scales smaller than @xmath90 ( e.g. current ) is faster than the decay of correlation functions spanned by the piece - wise constant basis @xmath239 .",
    "transition from the algebraic ( anomalous conductivity ) to the exponential ( normal conductivity ) decay of current autocorrelation function occurs rather abruptly at @xmath292 ( for @xmath293 ) .    finally ,",
