    "high-@xmath0 cavity qed has offered a number of novel possibilities of quantum - state engineering ( see , e.g , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , it provides promising tools to generate nonclassical quantum states of atoms and light for further use . accordingly various applications have been proposed , with special emphasis on quantum communication and computation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to atomic states , the usage of quantum states of light as carriers of quantum information is especially appropriate , due to the reliability of light to propagate over long distances @xcite .",
    "various schemes for generating nonclassical light in cavities have been considered .",
    "they are typically based on effective two - level atoms .",
    "a generator of single photon fock states in an active microcavity with pump self - regularization has been presented @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown experimentally that an entangled state of two nondegenerate cavity modes can be produced with means of a sequence of differently tuned interactions of a pair of single atoms with the two cavity modes @xcite , and a scheme for entangling two modes of spatially separated cavities by consecutively passing through them atoms has been purposed @xcite .",
    "a scheme has been proposed @xcite and experimentally realized @xcite for the generation of photon number states on demand , by subjecting single two - level atoms passing through a cavity to @xmath1 pulse interaction .",
    "similarly , a proposal has been made for entangling two cavity modes via interaction with a bunch of two - level atoms assisted by a strong classical driving field @xcite .",
    "schemes that exploit multilevel atoms have also been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , with special emphasis on effective three - level atoms of @xmath2 type .",
    "the main obstacles to generate nonclassical states are the various decoherence effects associated with , e.g. , the motion and spontaneous emission of the atoms as well as scattering , absorption , and transmission of the photon field .",
    "several proposals have been made to reduce the effect of decoherence due to the atomic motion @xcite . in order to reduce unwanted spontaneous emission in schemes that exploit multi - level atoms ,",
    "adiabatic transfer techniques have been promising @xcite .",
    "moreover , the adiabatic passage is the main idea of the proposal of quantum networks of trapped atoms , where cavity modes provide communication channels , by leaking out of the cavities and propagating via optical interconnectors @xcite . scattering and absorption losses , which are unavoidably connected with any material system ,",
    "may be reduced by well designed cavities and the use of materials showing extremely weak absorption , and almost perfectly reflecting mirrors reduce the transmission losses . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite a method is presented for the protection of a generic quantum state of a cavity mode against the decohering effects of photon losses by feedback atoms crossing the cavity mode .    on the other hand ,",
    "transmission losses are necessarily required to be taken into account in order to implement high-@xmath0 cavities that can serve as sources that emit nonclassical radiation for further use outside the cavities @xcite .",
    "the natural question arises whether or not nonclassical states of light , once generated inside a high-@xmath0 cavity , can be extracted from the cavity and what the ultimate limits are . in the schemes considered ,",
    "it is often made the ad hoc assumption of nearly perfect extraction ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the fact however is that even very small material absorption may be expected to lead to drastic quantum state degradation @xcite .",
    "recently , homodyne detection of the quantum state of the field leaving a high-@xmath0 cavity has been studied theoretically @xcite . from the results",
    "it might be expected that the quantum state , in which an excited cavity mode is prepared at some initial time , can be perfectly extracted from the cavity , so that after sufficiently long time , i.e. , when the cavity is effectively empty , the pulse which has left the cavity is in the same quantum state as the cavity mode initially was . however , in the analysis the effects of unwanted losses ( such as absorption and scattering losses ) on the extracted quantum state have not been considered . moreover , instead of calculating the quantum state of the outgoing field directly , the authors base the derivation on an operational definition of the wigner function in terms of collective mode operators introduced within the frame of the homodyne detection scheme considered .",
    "the reason is that they claim that due to the mode continuum outside the cavity the wigner function would be ill defined .    in this paper , we directly calculate as a function of time the quantum state of the pulse which leaves a high-@xmath0 cavity and may be used for further processing .",
    "the calculations are performed for arbitrary @xmath3-parametrized phase space functions , including the wigner function .",
    "taking into account both transmission and unwanted losses of the cavity mode , we show that the crucial parameter for the efficiency of quantum state extraction is the ratio of absorption losses to transmission losses of the cavity mode .",
    "as we will see , a quantum state can be almost perfectly extracted after sufficiently long time , only if the value of this ratio is sufficiently small , thereby the truly required smallness sensitively depending on the nonclassical features of the state .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the model is explained and the basic equations , including the operator input - output relations , are given .",
    "the quantum state of the outgoing field is calculated in sec .",

    "for a cavity , the widths @xmath8 of the cavity modes at frequencies are very small compared with their separation , where @xmath9 is the velocity of light .",
    "being interested in resolving times that are large compared with the time of propagation of light through the cavity , we may expand the intracavity field in terms of standing waves at frequencies @xmath10 , where the associated photon creation and annihilation operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , obey quantum langevin equations @xcite . for sufficiently large @xmath0 values , we may further assume that the time of excitation and preparation of a cavity wave in a ( desired ) quantum state is short compared with its decay time ( but still long compared with the propagation time through the cavity ) . in this case , the process of preparation of the cavity quantum state is well separated from the process of its transmission to the outside space .",

    "taking into account unwanted losses of the cavity mode , we have studied the conditions under which a nearly perfect extraction of non - classical quantum states from high-@xmath0 cavities should be possible .    to calculate the quantum state of the outgoing field , we started from its time - dependent continuous multimode characteristic functional . by appropriate diagonalization",

    ", the @xmath3-parametrized phase - space functions of the quantum state of the relevant non - monochromatic output mode can be expressed in terms of @xmath3-parametrized phase - space functions of the quantum state in which the cavity mode was prepared . in particular , the output wigner function can be given as a convolution of the cavity wigner function with a gaussian reflecting the unwanted losses .",
    "the crucial parameter for nearly perfect extraction of a quantum state from a high-@xmath0 cavity is the extraction efficiency , which in the long - time limit is determined by the ratio between the cavity - mode decay rate due to unwanted losses and the cavity - mode decay rate due to wanted ( i.e. , transmission ) losses .",
    "this ratio must be sufficiently small in order to realize a nearly @xmath144 extraction efficiency , where the really required smallness sensitively depends on the quantum state to be exctracted .",
    "in particular , extracting highly nonclassical states can require extremely small values of this ratio .",
    "it should be pointed out that even for the best optical high-@xmath0 microcavities available the required efficiencies for nearly perfect extraction of nonclassical quantum states have not been reached , because the unwanted losses are of the same order of magnitude as the transmission losses @xcite .",
    "so , in the simplest case of extracting from a cavity a one - photon fock state , the weight of the one - photon fock state exceeds the weight of the vacuum state in the mixed output quantum state only if the extraction efficiency is bigger than @xmath143 . however , the biggest value that has been realized so far in the production of triggered single photons by coupling a single semiconductor quantum dot to an optical mode in a micropost microcavity is about @xmath164 @xcite . on the contrary , in case of high-@xmath0 microwave cavities the absorption losses may be small compared with the transmission losses @xcite .",

    "the theory can also be extended to multimode excitation in a single cavity as well as multi - cavity systems .",
    "we have further assumed that the input field is in the vacuum quantum state .",
    "clearly , the underlying formalism can also be applied to the case , in which the input field is prepared in another than the vacuum state .",
    "needless to say that when the input field is in a thermal state , then additional noise is fed into the cavity , and the quantum state of the output field also carries additional noise . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , the operator input - output relation used in this paper does not take into account that the input field could be absorbed in the entrance port of the cavity , which would also give rise to additional noise . to include this effect in the theory , the input - output relation ( [ 13 ] ) should be generalized , e.g. , by following the line in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we have assumed that the process of preparation of the quantum state of the cavity mode is sufficiently short compared with the decay time of the cavity mode , so that the time scales of quantum state preparation and extraction are well separated from each other and the preparation process can be ignored in the calculations . at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that one possible way to reduce the effect of unwanted losses may be the use of cavities of deliberately enlarged transmission , so that the unwanted losses become small compared with transmission losses .",
    "when , for example , the radius of a microsphere cavity is diminished , then the transmission losses increase , thereby the absorption losses remaining nearly constant @xcite . since",
