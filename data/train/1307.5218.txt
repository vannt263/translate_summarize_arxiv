    "find is a one - sided version of the well - known sorting algorithm quicksort .",

    "this is called the @xmath19-version of the algorithm , since the first partitioning step leads to three cases .",

    "this specifies the find algorithm except for the choice of the pivot element in the partitioning step .",
    "it can be chosen as the first element of @xmath7 , if @xmath7 is given as a list ( vector ) so that a first element is well - defined , it can as well be chosen uniformly at random from @xmath7 . in order to obtain better balanced subsets @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively @xmath23 and @xmath12",
    ", one may first choose a subset @xmath24 of odd cardinality @xmath25 from @xmath7 and use the median of @xmath24 as pivot element .",

    "@xmath25 is fixed in advance and constant until the algorithm has performed all recursive calls and stops .",
    "a variant of find , which is discussed in the present paper , consists of letting @xmath26 depend on @xmath3 so that @xmath27 is odd and grows asymptotically as @xmath0 where @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",

    "we also assume that the subset for the pivot selection is chosen independently from the data .    as a measure for the complexity we consider the number of key comparisons required by the version of find .",

    "our approach to convergence is almost entirely based on contraction arguments on the level of the supremum norm of processes and very little ( deformation of time ) is needed in addition to align jumps . besides leading to comparatively strong results , we feel that the technique for convergence developed here is flexible and general to be easily applicable to related recursive problems .    a similar version of the quicksort algorithm consists in also choosing the pivot element in each step as a median of a random sub - sample of size @xmath87 with @xmath3 the size of the list to be split .",
