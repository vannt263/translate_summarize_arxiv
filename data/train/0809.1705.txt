    "a reliable implementation of a quantum gate is required to realize quantum computing . a quantum gate is often realized by manipulating the parameters in the hamiltonian of a system so that the time - evolution operator results in a desired unitary gate . on the other hand ,",
    "when the system has a degenerate energy eigenvalue , adiabatic parameter control allows us to construct a quantum gate employing non - abelian holonomy@xcite .",
    "holonomy corresponds to the difference between the initial and the final quantum states under an adiabatic change of parameters along a closed path ( loop ) in the parameter manifold @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , a desired quantum gate can be implemented by choosing a proper closed loop in @xmath1 .",
    "this scheme is called the holonomic quantum computing ( hqc ) .",
    "the idea was suggested first in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been developed subsequently by many authors @xcite .",
    "holonomy is geometrical by nature , and hence it is independent of how fast the loop in the parameter manifold is traversed .",
    "in addition , if the lowest eigenspace of the spectra is employed as a computational subspace , it is free from errors caused by spontaneous decay .",
    "thus , hqc is expected to be robust against noise and decoherence @xcite .    in spite of its mathematical beauty , physical implementation of hqc",
    "is far from trivial .",
    "the difficulties are ( i ) to find a quantum system in which the lowest energy eigenvalue is degenerate and ( ii ) to design a control which leaves the ground state degenerate as the loop is traversed .",
    "several theoretical ideas have been proposed in linear optics  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , and josephson junction qubits  @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment following the proposals made in @xcite , where the coding space is not the lowest eigenspace , has been reported  @xcite .",

    "a single logical qubit is represented by two spin-@xmath0 physical spins ; the qubit is a dimer . in the dimer ,",
    "the spins interact with each other through a heisenberg - type interaction and its lowest eigenvalue is doubly degenerate for a particular set of the coupling constant and the zeeman energies .",
    "the spin chain model may be applicable to various physical systems , such as solid state systems . however , there is room to reconsider and improve their proposal . in particular , we want to investigate whether the heisenberg - type interaction is essential for hqc in a spin chain model .",
