    "<S> the possibility of the first measurement of bjorken unpolarized sum rule for @xmath0 structure function of @xmath1 deep - inelastic scattering at neutrino factories is commented . </S>",

    "<S> the direct measurement of @xmath8 sf is allowing to perform the first experimental determination of the bjorken unpolarized sum rule , which has the following theoretical expression @xmath9=1-\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\alpha_s}{\\pi}- ... +o(\\frac{1}{q^2})\\ ] ] the bjorken unpolarized sum rule is related to the adler isospin sum rule @xmath10=1 $ ] by the following relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 $ ] is the callan - gross relation for @xmath1 dis , which contains perturbative qcd corrections and higher - twist terms , responsible for difference between the bjorken unpolarized sum rule and the explicit adler sum rule . in the @xmath13-scheme the massless perturbative qcd expression for @xmath14 , namely @xmath15 , </S>",

    "<S> next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order corrections were subsequently calculated in refs.@xcite , @xcite and ref.@xcite respectively . </S>",

    "<S> . moreover , turning the problems around and fixing @xmath35-value in the available perturbative expression for the bjorken unpolarized sum rule , one can try to extract from the analysis of low @xmath2-data of neutrino factories the independent estimates of the corresponding twist-4 contributions . </S>",
    "<S> another problem , which can be of interest for the future program of neutrino factories , is the study of nuclear corrections to this still unmeasured sum rule of @xmath1 dis ( for the discussions see ref.@xcite ) .    </S>",
