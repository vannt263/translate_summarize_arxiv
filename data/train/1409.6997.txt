    "optimal control problems associated to fluid dynamics have been studied by several authors , during the last decades , motivated by the important applications of such type of problems to the industry . in a natural way",
    ", most of the first works were devoted to the case of distributed control as this is easier to handle .",
    "however , the most challenging problems in applications such as automobile or airplane design , and more recently , in bypass design or boundary reconstruction in medical applications , are modeled by problems where the control is assumed to act on part of the boundary .",
    "actually , boundary control problems are usually harder to deal , specially with respect to optimality conditions , since higher regularity for the solutions is often required .",
    "the list of works on the subject is long , and here",
    "we only mention a few references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in this work , and having in mind applications in biomedicine",
    ", we will consider the steady navier - stokes equations with mixed boundary conditions    @xmath0    where @xmath1 represents the viscosity of the fluid ( possibly divided by its constant density ) , @xmath2 the vector force acting on the fluid and @xmath3 the function imposing the velocity profile on @xmath4 .",
    "the unknowns are the velocity vector field @xmath5 and the pressure variable @xmath6 .",
    "these equations have been widely used to model and simulate the blood flow in the cardiovascular system ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references cited therein ) . in this type of applications",
    "it is often required to represent part of an artery as the computational ( bounded ) domain @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , for the numerical simulations , we impose homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface representing the vessel wall ( @xmath8 ) and dirichlet non - homogeneous on the artificial boundary ( @xmath4 ) , which is used to truncate the vessel from the upstream region . besides , on the surface limiting the domain , in the downstream direction ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "homogeneous neumann boundary conditions are imposed . in figure  [ figdomain ]",
    "we can see a longitudinal section of such a domain , where the deformation of @xmath8 could represent the presence of a plaque of atherosclerosis .",
    "when facing this and other type of pathologies of the cardiovascular system , it is important the evaluation of hemodynamical factors to predict , in a non invasive way , either the evolution of the disease , or the effect of possible therapies .",
    "this can be done by relying on the numerical simulations obtained in the domain under analysis .",
    "the main difficulty in this strategy lies in the lack of accuracy of the virtual simulations with respect to the real situation . in order to improve the accuracy and make the simulations sound enough , it is possible to use data from measurements of the blood velocity profile , obtained through medical imaging in some smaller parts of the vessel",
    "this can be done through a variational approach , i.e. , by setting an optimal control problem with a cost function ( or a class of cost functions ) of the type @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the data available only on a part of the domain called @xmath12 .",
    "note that , while fixing the weights @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we determine whether the minimization of @xmath16 emphasizes more a good approximation of the velocity vector to @xmath17 , a `` less expensive '' control @xmath3 ( in terms of the @xmath18-norm ) , or a smoother control .",
    "an example of @xmath17 , measured in @xmath12 , could be the velocity vectors obtained in several cross sections of the vessel , as represented in figure  [ figdata ] .",
    "solving the optimal control problem @xmath19 will give us the means of making blood flow simulations more reliable , using known data .",
    "this strategy is not new , and has already been used as a proof of concept in @xcite and @xcite , where both the navier - stokes and the generalized navier - stokes equations were considered to model the blood flow .",
    "even if it proved to be successful from the numerical point of view , problem @xmath20 has not yet been studied , at least up to the authors knowledge , not even with respect to the existence of solution .",
    "in fact , many authors have treated similar problems , considering the same type of cost functionals constrained to the navier - stokes equations , but for the case where @xmath21 and without using mixed boundary conditions . in @xcite and @xcite the case with only dirichlet boundary conditions , and a similar cost functional , was treated . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors considered @xmath16 as the cost functional , with @xmath21 , but again they just dealt with dirichlet boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    "the authors considered a more complex set of mixed boundary condition , but for a different cost functional .    here",
    "we prove the existence of solution for problem @xmath20 regarded in the weak sense .",
    "we will make the distinction between different possibilities both for @xmath12 and for the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in order to do that",
    ", we will start by setting the existence of a unique weak solution for the state equation ( [ navierstokes ] ) .",
    "the regularity of this solution remains an open problem and will not be treated here .",
    "it is important to deal with this issue , before addressing the natural following stages , namely the derivation of optimality conditions for problem @xmath20 and the numerical approximation .",
    "the organization of this paper reads as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some notation and results needed for this work .",
    "the navier - stokes equations with mixed boundary conditions are studied in section 3 . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , we prove the existence of solution for a class of optimal control problems .",
    "we consider @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , an open bounded subset with lipschitz boundary .",
    "the standard sobolev spaces are denoted by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath28 is defined by interpolation .",
    "the dual space of @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "we also use @xmath31 to represent the hilbert spaces @xmath32 . for @xmath33 with positive measure we denote by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the image of the unique linear continuous trace operator @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 . in particular , for @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the subspace of @xmath41 corresponding to the image of the continuous functions in @xmath42 .",
    "the norm of @xmath34 is defined similarly to the norm in @xmath42 , except that the tangential derivatives on @xmath43 should be used ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "whenever @xmath44 is a space of functions @xmath45 , we will use the boldface notation @xmath46 for the corresponding space of vector valued functions .",
    "we will also make use of the following sobolev embedding result :    [ sobolev ] let @xmath7 be a bounded set of class @xmath47 .",

    "we consider the spaces of divergence free functions defined by @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 refers to the dirichlet boundary @xmath57 . in these definitions , for @xmath58 , we represent by @xmath59 the set @xmath60 the corresponding norms are defined by @xmath61    we also define @xmath62 and @xmath63 a closed subspace of @xmath64 .",
    "note that we have the continuous embeddings @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xcite , pp .",
    "finally , we set @xmath67",
    "the well - posedness of system ( [ navierstokes ] ) concerning the existence and uniqueness for @xmath3 within an admissible class is required before studying the existence of solution of the optimal control problem . in @xcite",
    "the authors studied the evolutionary case setting the existence of a solution local in time , for the type of boundary conditions considered here . concerning the stationary case , in @xcite and @xcite the existence of solution for a similar system",
    "was proved .",
    "both authors considered neumann conditions mixed with dirichlet homogeneous conditions . in the",
    "later it was mentioned that no additional difficulties should be expected with non - homogeneous boundary conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "the existence was shown , in the 2d case , for a system with mixed boundary conditions including dirichlet non - homogeneous .",
    "again the authors mentioned that the 3d case could be proved using the same techniques .",
    "for the sake of clearness , we show that system ( [ navierstokes ] ) is in fact well - posed in the 3d case , following the ideas of @xcite .",
    "we first start by considering the stokes system @xmath68    let @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "if @xmath5 and    @xmath6 are smooth enough , then @xmath6 is unique and    the boundary conditions in ( [ stokes ] ) are verified point - wise .",
    "ii ) : :    on the other hand , if    @xmath79    is a solution of problem @xmath80 in the sense of    distributions , then @xmath81 is a solution of ( [ weakstokes ] ) .",

    "the classical theory    of the calculus of variations ensures the existence of a unique    solution @xmath88 for the minimization problem .",
    "hence ,    @xmath88 is also the unique solution of the necessary and    sufficient optimality condition    @xmath89    and therefore ( [ weakstokes ] ) has a unique solution .",

    "let @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is a given ball with respect to the @xmath171 metrics . then",

    "thus , we must have @xmath221 .",
    "finally , since the convective term in ( [ weaknavierstokes ] ) is weakly continuous in @xmath85 ( see @xcite p.286 ) we conclude that @xmath88 is the solution corresponding to @xmath220 . due to the fact that the functional @xmath16 is both convex and continuous , and therefore strong lower semi - continuous ( l.s.c . ) , it is also l.s.c . with respect to the weak topology ( @xcite remark iii.8.6 ) .",
    "consequently ,      the fact that we assume @xmath224 bounded in @xmath225 is a very strong assumption which allows us to prove the result even either if @xmath226 or @xmath227 . in this latter case , the l.s.c .",
