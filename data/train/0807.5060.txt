    "let @xmath0 be the group of automorphisms of @xmath2 that is generated by the following two linear transformations : @xmath105 we will show that the orbits of compact , open subgroups under @xmath0 are quasi - isometric to @xmath106 , but that the group @xmath0 is not flat .",
    "the group @xmath109 has index  @xmath103 in @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath110 is generated by one element , it is a flat group whose rank is either  @xmath111 or  @xmath112 ; this may be seen for example by applying lemma  2 in  @xcite with @xmath113 .",
    "the group @xmath110 has unbounded orbits in @xmath3 ; hence the rank of @xmath110 must be larger than  @xmath111 and hence is  @xmath112 . using theorem  [ thm : norm > flat - gp ] we conclude the orbits of the group @xmath110 in @xmath3 are quasi - isometric to @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath110 has finite index in @xmath0 the same is true of the orbits of the group @xmath0 in @xmath3 , as claimed .",
    "we now show by contradiction that the group @xmath0 is not flat . for suppose it were .",
    "then the elements @xmath107 and  @xmath108 are contained in the subgroup @xmath114 , because they have finite order . since @xmath107 and @xmath108 generate @xmath0 , we then must have @xmath115 , the rank of @xmath0 would be  @xmath111 and all orbits of @xmath0 in @xmath3 would be bounded .",
    "this is a contradiction to what we have shown to be the case above and we conclude that @xmath0 is not flat , as claimed .    the phenomenon illustrated in the above example does not occur with groups of automorphisms whose orbits in @xmath3 are bounded . under this condition one",

    "this stronger form of the geometric flatness criterion in the rank-@xmath111-case has played an important role in the recent study , by y. shalom and g. willis , of almost normal subgroups of arithmetic groups via suitable completions .",
    "we now show how the results of this paper lead to a remarkably simple and straightforward proof of the following result .",
    "these notions are used in its formulation : a flat subgroup is a subgroup that is flat as a group of inner automorphisms ; the flat rank of a totally disconnected , locally compact group is the supremum of the ranks of its flat subgroups .",

    "the group @xmath126 stabilizes @xmath125 and acts there by affine isometries .",

    "we next use theorem  7 from  @xcite to turn the statements of the previous paragraph into statements about the action of @xmath120 on @xmath122 .",
    "we conclude that the orbits of @xmath65 and @xmath131 in @xmath122 are quasi - flats of dimension @xmath132 .",
    "that @xmath123 follows from corollary  19 in  @xcite .",
    "the orbits of the stabilizer of a chamber in @xmath125 under @xmath65 and @xmath131 are proper ; in fact , the metric space @xmath122 is proper . from either theorem  [ thm : mainthm ] or theorem  [ thm : mainthm_weak - form ]",
    "we infer that @xmath65 and @xmath131 are virtually flat subgroups of @xmath120 of maximal rank .",
    "we claim next that the subgroup of bounded conjugacy classes @xmath133 of @xmath65 equals @xmath131 . applying theorem  [ thm : bounded - conjugacy - classe = max - normal - flat ] to this statement yields that @xmath131 is flat ; since we know that @xmath65 is the full stabilizer of @xmath125 , every flat subgroup containing @xmath131 must be contained in @xmath65 and we will obtain our remaining claims .",
    "we are therefore reduced to proving that @xmath134 .",
    "the group @xmath131 is contained in @xmath133 because it acts by translations on @xmath125 and any conjugate of a translation is a translation which displaces points by the same amount as the original translation .",
    "the set @xmath135 consists of elements which act as reflections or rotations on @xmath125 ; no such element can be contained in @xmath133 , because given a fixed point of @xmath125 that point will be displaced by an arbitrarily large amount by a conjugate of such a transformation by a translation of sufficiently large displacement .",
    "thus @xmath134 , concluding our proof .",
    "it is uncertain whether one can also find a minimizing subgroup for the group @xmath119 in the previous result along the same lines .",
