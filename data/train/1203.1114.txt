    "in classical statistics , the so - called simpson s `` paradox '' , also referred to as the yule - simpson effect @xcite , occurs when the correlations observed in different groups are reversed when the groups are combined together .",
    "the typical examples come from social- or medical - science @xcite : suppose you are given two samples , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , on which the rates of success of two events , say , the success of two different therapies or of two ways of applying for a job , are given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , with @xmath4 .",
    "the rates of success express the degree of correlations between the events under consideration and the characteristic features of the samples @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then , it may occur that by splitting the initial samples in groups , say @xmath5 and @xmath6 , according to the the value of a certain _ lurking variable _",
    "( say , gender , age , geographical localization , .. ) the ordering of the rates of success , and thus of the correlations , is reversed , in formula @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as for example",
    ", a certain therapy may appear _ good for women _ and _ good for men _ , but _",
    "bad for people _ @xcite .",
    "actually , there is no mathematical paradox : the ys effect arises from a hidden correlation , and it may be explained in terms of the relative weights of the groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 , due to different sizes of the samples in the groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "an example illustrating the point is reported in the appendix .",
    "on the other hand , the practical consequences of the effect are indeed counterintuitive for decision making , since the aggregated data and the partitioned ones are , in fact , suggesting opposite strategies @xcite .",
    "other examples arises in game theory , where it may be shown that two losing strategies may be randomly combined to form a winning one @xcite realizing , in fact , a variation of the ys effect . from the operational point of view",
    "there is an additional reason for the emergence of the ys effect , which may summarized by saying the two events are incompatible : once a therapy has been administered , or an application has been submitted , there is no way to determine the outcome of the other options for the same individual @xcite . in other words , there is no way to assign a definite meaning to the rate of success of the two events simultaneously . loosely speaking",
    ", this fact suggests that other incompatibilities @xcite , as those arising from the quantum mechanical description of measurements , may play a role for the occurrence of the ys effect .    in this communication , we address this possibility in details and investigate the occurrence of the ys effect in systems subjected to the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , we analyze the role of mixing and superposition of quantum states , and illustrate the occurrence of two kinds of ys effects in quantum measurements .",
    "the first , which we term _ quantum - classical _ ys effect ( qcys ) , may occur with quantum limited measurements and mixing of states , whereas the second , here referred to as _ quantum - quantum _ ys effect ( qqys ) , may take place when superpositions of quantum states are allowed .",
    "we describe both effects in some details , prove that they may occur independently , and present a class of states for which qqys effect occurs when , for the same values of the involved parameters , the qcys one does not .",
    "let us consider two quantum tests , i.e. two binary probability operator - valued measures ( povms ) @xmath11 and @xmath12 aimed at describing the occurrence of certain events @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "given a quantum state @xmath13 , the expectation value @xmath14 returns the probability of the event @xmath15 on the state @xmath13 , and thus represents the correlations between the occurrence of the event and the preparation of the system .",
    "we assume that the system under investigation may be prepared in two possible states @xmath16 , @xmath17 and that the event @xmath0 is more likely to happen than the event @xmath1 for both preparations , i.e. @xmath18 we have the yule - simpson effect whenever it occurs that for some choice of the mixing parameters ( which play the role of relative weights due to different sample sizes ) the event @xmath1 become more probable for the system prepared in mixed state @xmath19 < q \\equiv\\hbox{tr}[\\varrho_\\beta\\,\\pi_{{\\scriptscriptstyle b}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 = \\cos^2\\alpha\\ , p_1 + \\sin^2\\alpha\\ , p_2 $ ] and @xmath21 = \\cos^2\\beta\\ , q_1 + \\sin^2\\beta\\ , q_2 $ ] ( see table 1 for a summary ) . the condition @xmath22 may be written as @xmath23 and it is satisfied by @xmath24 if @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to this form of the yule - simpson effect as to _ quantum - classical _",
    "simpson s paradox since it happens in quantum - limited measurements , however with the lurking variable coming from the classical mixing of two quantum states .",
    ".the quantum - classical yule - simpson effect [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to gain a quantitative insight into both effects let us start by focusing on bidimensional systems ( qubits ) . in this case",
    "we may write the initial states as @xmath30 is a basis for the hilbert space , and the povms as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are pauli matrices . the constraint of positivity for the @xmath35 s is expressed by the conditions @xmath36 .",
    "projective measurements are those individuated by the relations @xmath37 .    before going to the general case ,",
    "let us consider the specific example where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are mutually exclusive events .",
    "classically , there is no ys effect in this case , since no lurking variable may change the correlations .",
    "quantum mechanically , the two mutually exclusive events are described by projective measurements on two orthogonal states .",
    "for qubits they span the entire hilbert space , i.e. @xmath38 . as a consequence , we have @xmath39 and , in turn , @xmath40 if @xmath41 , i.e no qcys effect . on the other hand , by looking at eqs .",
    "( [ pq1 ] ) and ( [ pq2 ] ) , one sees that qqys effect takes place whenever we have @xmath42 for @xmath43 , e.g. upon choosing @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "more generally , the occurrence of qcys and qqys may be investigated in terms of the four + eight + four parameters describing the initial states @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the povms @xmath35 , @xmath52 , and the lurking variables @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ f : d2 ] we report results for random states and measurements , generated to satisfy the constraints @xmath41 , @xmath17 , and for random lurking variables . in particular , we show the ratio @xmath54 as a function of the ratio @xmath55 .",
    "the square region @xmath56 corresponds to the occurrence of both the qc and qq ys effects , whereas the rectangular regions @xmath57 and @xmath58 correspond to cases when solely the qc effect , or the qq one , takes place , respectively .",
    "finally , the region @xmath59 corresponds to situations when we have no ys effects .",
    "on the left , we show the results for random states and measurements , and for random lurking variables @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] , whereas on the right we consider only situations for which @xmath62 .     as a function of @xmath55 for @xmath63",
    "randomly generated sets of states , measurements , and lurking variables .",
    "right : the same plot for fixed values of the mixing parameters @xmath62.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath55 for @xmath63 randomly generated sets of states , measurements , and lurking variables .",
    "right : the same plot for fixed values of the mixing parameters @xmath62.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as it is apparent from the left plot , the two effects may occur independently , i.e. we may have @xmath22 when @xmath64 , and viceversa . for random settings , i.e. random states , measurements and lurking variables ,",
    "the qqys effect is more likely to occur than the corresponding ccys effect . upon generating a sample of @xmath63 random settings",
    ", we found qcys effect without the qqys one in about @xmath65 of cases , just the reverse in about @xmath66 of cases , and both effects in about @xmath67 of cases .",
    "the right plot refers to random initial states and measurements , and to lurking variables with equal mixing parameters @xmath68 . in this case , as mentioned before , the qcys effect can not occur for any measurement . on the other hand , upon considering quantum superpositions",
    ", we have that the qqys effect occurs for a consistent fraction of the possible settings ( about @xmath69 ) .",
    "if we consider only projective measurements , the rates of occurrence of both the ys effects increases , but the overall picture is not qualitatively modified .",
    "similar results are also obtained by considering three - dimensional quantum systems ( qutrits ) .",
    "let us now assume that besides the complete mixture @xmath70 , and the coherent superposition @xmath71 , the system may be also prepared in partially coherent superpositions of the two initial states @xmath16 , i.e. we consider the general class of states @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "the family @xmath74 continuously connects the coherent superposition to the complete mixture , and we now address the occurrence of the corresponding generalized qqys effect , which takes place , assuming again @xmath41 , @xmath17 , when we have @xmath75 , where @xmath76 = \\lambda p + ( 1-\\lambda ) p$ ] , @xmath77 = \\lambda q + ( 1-\\lambda ) q$ ] . using these expressions and introducing the threshold value @xmath78",
    "one easily see that the qqys effect persists in the range @xmath79 if @xmath80 , or @xmath81 if @xmath82 .",

    "f : lam ] , where we show the ratio @xmath84 as a function of the ratio @xmath55 for @xmath63 sets of randomly generated states , measurements and lurking variables ( as in fig .",
    "[ f : d2 ] ) , and for different values of @xmath85 .",
    "the yule - simpson is a paradigmatic paradoxical effect occurring in data aggregation in complex systems , and found applications in the physical description of , e.g. social processes @xcite , complex dynamics @xcite , and game theory @xcite . in this communication , we have illustrated the occurrence of the ys effect in quantum measurements , where the lurking variables are coming either from the mixing or the superposition of quantum states . by analyzing low dimensional systems , we have found that the two effects may occur independently , and that the quantum - quantum ys effect is more likely to occur than the corresponding quantum - classical one for the same set of states and measurements .",
    "we have also discussed an example , illustrating the occurence of the quantum - classical ys effect in a decision problem involving quantum measurements .",
    "one of the best known real life examples of simpson s paradox occurred when the university of california , berkeley was sued for bias against women who had applied for admission to graduate schools there @xcite .",
    "the admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted , and the difference was so large that it was unlikely to be due to statistical fluctuations . on the other hand",
    ", when examining the individual departments , it appeared that no department was significantly biased against women .",
    "in fact , most departments had a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women @xcite .",
    "the explanation of the `` paradox '' is relatively simple : the women tended to apply to competitive departments , with low rates of admission even among qualified applicants ( such as in the english department ) , whereas men tended to apply to less - competitive departments with high rates of admission among the qualified applicants ( such as in engineering and chemistry ) , and overall this results in a smaller fraction of women admitted in total .",
