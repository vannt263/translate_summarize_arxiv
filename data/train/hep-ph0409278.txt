    "weak - scale supersymmetry remains a beautiful framework for resolving the problems of electroweak symmetry breaking and dark matter  @xcite , and its discovery is among the most eagerly anticipated events in particle physics .",
    "opportunities for supersymmetry discoveries and studies at colliders depend largely on which superpartner is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in simple supergravity models ,",
    "supersymmetry is transmitted to standard model superpartners through gravitational interactions , and supersymmetry is broken at a high scale .",
    "the mass of the gravitino @xmath1 is @xmath2 and the masses of standard model superpartners are @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the supersymmetry breaking scale squared , and @xmath5 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "the precise ordering of masses depends on unknown , presumably @xmath6 , constants in eq .",
    "( [ tildem ] ) .",
    "most supergravity studies assume that the lsp is a standard model superpartner , such as a slepton or neutralino .",
    "recently attention has turned to the other logical possibility , namely , that the gravitino is the lsp  @xcite . in supergravity where supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravity , the gravitino has a mass @xmath7 if the superpartner mass scale is @xmath8 .",
    "the gravitino couplings are also suppressed by @xmath9 .",
    "the gravitino s extremely weak interactions imply that it is irrelevant for most supersymmetric processes .",
    "however , if the gravitino is the lsp , the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) decays to its standard model partner and a gravitino . the nlsp is a weak - scale particle decaying gravitationally and",
    "so has a natural lifetime of @xmath10 as will be discussed more fully in sec .",
    "[ sec : slepton ] . this lifetime emerges naturally in this simple supersymmetric scenario . at the same time",
    ", it is outlandishly long by particle physics standards  @xcite .",
    "it requires a revamping of many aspects of supersymmetric phenomenology and cosmology and opens up novel opportunities , including the one discussed here .",
    "the gravitino lsp scenario is constrained by cosmological and astrophysical data .",
    "the gravitino is a stable superweakly massive particle ( superwimp ) and forms dark matter .",
    "its production during reheating and by nlsp decays is therefore constrained by measurements of the non - baryonic cold dark matter density .",
    "nlsp decays also deposit electromagnetic  @xcite and hadronic  @xcite energy into the universe well after big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and so may ruin the successful predictions of standard bbn .",
    "these decays may also distort the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from its observed planckian spectrum .",
    "last , photons produced in nlsp decays are subject to bounds on the diffuse photon flux .    the impact of these constraints on the gravitino lsp scenario have been considered in detail .",
    "in addition to the leading two - body nlsp decays to the gravitino  @xcite , three - body nlsp decays must also be considered when they are the leading contribution to hadronic cascades  @xcite .",
    "the result is that the gravitino lsp scenario is not excluded and , in fact , all constraints may be satisfied for natural weak - scale nlsp and gravitino masses .",
    "not all possibilities are allowed , however , and two results are particularly worth noting .",
    "first , neutralino nlsps are highly disfavored  @xcite .",
    "neutralinos typically have two - body decays @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting hadronic cascades destroy bbn successes , and exclude this scenario unless such decays are highly suppressed .",
    "kinematic suppression is not viable , however  if @xmath12 , the decay @xmath13 takes place so late that it violates bounds on electromagnetic cascades .",
    "neutralino nlsps are therefore allowed only when the two - body decays to @xmath14 bosons are suppressed dynamically , as when the neutralino is photino - like , a possibility that is not well - motivated by high energy frameworks .",
    "slepton and sneutrino nlsps also produce hadronic energy when they decay , but this occurs only through three - body decays .",
    "these have been analyzed and found to be safe  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the most natural nlsp candidates are sleptons , particularly the right - handed stau .",
    "second , cosmological constraints exclude the upper range of lifetimes in eq .",
    "( [ lifetime ] )  @xcite .",
    "very late decays occur in a cold universe where decay products are not effectively thermalized and so are especially dangerous . for typical thermal relic nlsp abundances ,",
    "the cmb and bbn constraints therefore provide an upper bound on nlsp lifetimes , roughly excluding those above a year .",
    "in passing , we note that the scenario outlined above has a number of other motivations .",
    "one such motivation is from bbn .",
    "late nlsp decays not only pass all bbn constraints , they may even resolve the leading bbn anomaly by destroying @xmath15li to bring the predicted abundance in line with the low values favored by observations  @xcite . to resolve the @xmath15li anomaly",
    ", the preferred nlsp lifetime is @xmath16",
    "@xcite , that is , about a month .",
    "a second motivation follows from considerations of leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "gravitinos may be produced during reheating . if the gravitino is not the lsp , its late decays are dangerous to bbn , and require reheating temperatures @xmath17 to @xmath18  @xcite , in conflict with the requirement @xmath19 of thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the gravitino lsp scenario , the gravitino does not decay , and the reheat temperature is bounded only by the overclosure constraint on the gravitino density . for @xmath7 ,",
    "reheat temperatures as high as @xmath20 are allowed  @xcite , consistent with thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "additional connections between leptogenesis and gravitino lsps are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given all of these motivations , we investigate here the collider implications of a gravitino lsp with a charged slepton nlsp with lifetime under ( but not much under ) a year  @xcite . in particular , we investigate the possibility of trapping sleptons in material placed just outside large hadron collider ( lhc ) or international linear collider ( ilc ) detectors .",
    "this material may then be moved to some quiet location so that slepton decays may be observed in a relatively background - free environment . although these objectives may be realized in many ways , we study here the particularly simple possibility of trapping sleptons in water tanks which may be drained periodically to underground reservoirs where the slepton decays may be observed .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : slepton ] we discuss the relevant properties of sleptons in the gravitino lsp scenario . in sec .",
    "[ sec : trap ] we discuss our procedure for maximizing the number of sleptons trapped given a fixed volume of water .",
    "this is applied to the cases of the lhc and ilc in secs .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] and [ sec : ilc ] , respectively . at the lhc",
    ", we find that tens to thousands of sleptons may be trapped each year , depending on the overall mass scale of supersymmetry . at the ilc ,",
    "typically far fewer sleptons are produced .",
    "however , by controlling the beam energy , the velocity of produced sleptons may be tuned to some low value , allowing a large fraction of sleptons to be trapped . by exploiting this feature , we find that an order of magnitude more sleptons may be trapped at the ilc than at the lhc .",
    "these results imply that percent level studies of slepton decays may be possible .",
    "such studies will have fundamental implications for supergravity , supersymmetry breaking , dark matter , and dark energy .",
    "these implications and our conclusions are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : implications ] .",
    "in supergravity with a gravitino lsp , the slepton nlsp is expected to have a weak - scale mass .",
    "current collider bounds require @xmath21 from null searches for long - lived charged tracks at lep ii  @xcite .",
    "cosmology brings additional considerations , however .",
    "gravitinos produced in the late decays of sleptons are superwimp dark matter . barring the possibility of entropy production after slepton freeze out",
    ", the gravitino relic density must therefore satisfy @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the slepton s thermal relic density , and the non - baryonic cold dark matter density is constrained to the range @xmath24 .",
    "assuming @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not too disparate , this provides an upper bound on the slepton and gravitino masses , since @xmath27 . without special effects , @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 , the overclosure constraint requires superpartner masses below about 3 tev .    on the other hand ,",
    "a particularly attractive possibility is that gravitino superwimps are most or even all of the non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "although not a strict requirement , one might therefore prefer @xmath31 .",
    "the decay to the gravitino only reduces the relic density . without special effects , then , overclosure requires @xmath32 .",
    "such heavy sleptons will be difficult to explore at the lhc and are kinematically inaccessible in the first stage of the ilc .",
    "just as in conventional neutralino dark matter scenarios , however , there are supplementary mechanisms for gravitino production .",
    "one such mechanism is co - annihilation .",
    "if a neutralino @xmath33 is just slightly heavier than the slepton , it will freeze out with the slepton and later decay to the slepton , adding its thermal relic density to the slepton s .",
    "this allows supersymmetric models with much lower slepton masses to produce the correct gravitino superwimp dark matter density .",
    "for example , in minimal supergravity with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , the desired relic density may be achieved near the @xmath37 lsp@xmath33 lsp border at @xmath38 , where @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , gravitinos may be produced during reheating . for reheating temperatures @xmath40 ,",
    "as might be preferred for leptogenesis as discussed above , gravitinos may again be all of the non - baryonic dark matter for slepton masses as low as 120 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such effects may be very important .",
    "we will consider a variety of slepton masses below , including those within reach of a first stage ilc .",
    "we reiterate that all of these considerations depend on the assumption that gravitinos make up all of the dark matter . from a purely particle physics viewpoint , this is clearly optional  some other particle , such as the axion , may be the dark matter . in this case ,",
    "gravitino lsps and light nlsp sleptons are perfectly possible without any additional restrictions .",
    "the width for the decay of a slepton to a gravitino is @xmath41 ^ 4 \\ , \\label{sfermionwidth}\\ ] ] assuming the lepton mass is negligible .",
    "this decay width depends on only the slepton mass , the gravitino mass , and the planck mass . in many supersymmetric decays ,",
    "dynamics brings a dependence on many supersymmetry parameters .",
    "in contrast , as decays to the gravitino are gravitational , dynamics is determined by masses , and so no additional parameters enter . in particular , there is no dependence on left - right mixing or flavor mixing in the slepton sector .",
    "last , it will be crucial to this study to know the range of sleptons in matter . charged particles passing through matter lose energy by emitting radiation and by ionizing atoms . at lower energies",
    ", ionization dominates the energy loss , while at high energies , radiation is the dominant effect . as we will see below , it is unreasonable to expect to stop sleptons with momenta much larger than their rest mass . for the present case , then , ionization losses are dominant , and radiation is negligible .",
    "the average energy loss due to ionization is given by the bethe - bloch equation .",
    "the low energy approximation to the bethe - bloch equation may be derived  @xcite by first calculating the classical cross section for a collision with fixed impact parameter and energy loss .",
    "one then integrates the impact parameter from the compton wavelength of the free electron as seen by the charged particle to a maximal impact parameter where the particle can not `` see '' the electron in the time that it passes by the atom . a more refined treatment yields the bethe - bloch equation  @xcite @xmath42 \\ , \\label{bb}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the energy loss per @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the electron mass .",

    "( [ bb ] ) arise from the fact that electrons in matter are bound to atoms .",
    "this implies that there is transverse momentum in the collision ( bloch corrections ) and that the electron may have momentum comparable to the incident particle ( shell corrections ) .",
    "these corrections are significant only when the momentum of the incoming particle is comparable to the electron momentum . as discussed below , we will neglect contributions to the slepton range from very low velocities . for @xmath60 sleptons traveling at the velocities",
    "we include , the bloch and shell corrections may be safely neglected .",

    "on the other hand , for models with superpartners within reach , the ilc beam energy may be tuned to optimize the number of trapped sleptons , to some extent offsetting variations in the scale of superpartner masses in these models . as we will see , the crucial feature is not the exact mass of the slepton nlsp , but rather the presence of other nearly degenerate superpartner states .    for the ilc , then , we limit our analysis to two models . in the first , which we denote `` nlsp only , '' the only superpartner within reach of the ilc is an nlsp @xmath123 with mass 219 gev .",

    "the msugra model is one of the family of models considered previously in the lhc analysis , allowing us to compare the lhc and ilc at one particular model point .",
    "because it contains the `` nlsp only '' model as a subset , it also allows us to see the effect of having other accessible and fairly degenerate superpartners .",
    "the accessible standard model superpartners of the two models and their masses are : @xmath126    we generate @xmath127 non - standard model ilc events for the msugra model with isasusy 7.69 with @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "events for the `` nlsp only '' model are compiled by selecting the prompt stau events from this event sample .",
    "we choose beam width 0.12 mm , and beamstrahlung parameter @xmath128 , and allow the subprocess energy to vary over the entire range from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .    in the `` nlsp only '' model ,",
    "the nlsp staus are produced through @xmath131 .",
    "the stau energy distribution is therefore given by the beam energy modified by initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung .",
    "an example with @xmath132 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions_nlsp ] . the stau polar angle distribution is also given in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions_nlsp ] . despite isr and beamstrahlung",
    ", it retains the @xmath133 shape of the parton - level process .",
    "the best place to trap sleptons is therefore perpendicular to the beam line , justifying our choice of centering our trap geometries at @xmath109 , as parameterized in eq .",
    "( [ shape ] ) .    the number of trapped sleptons for various trap sizes as a function of center - of - mass energy @xmath130 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ilcresults_nlsp ] . for @xmath134 , no staus escape the ilc detector . at @xmath135 , however , sleptons in the sharp peak of the energy distribution escape the ilc detector and may be caught in a fairly thin water tank placed just outside the ilc detector .    as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : ilcresults_nlsp ] , for the 1 and 0.1 kton water traps , the number of trapped staus is maximized when the beam energy is tuned to produce staus that just barely emerge from the ilc detector .",
    "the dependence on trap parameters is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal_ilc_nlsp ] .",
    "the optimized trap configuration has @xmath136 and @xmath137 ; because the stau distribution is peaked at @xmath109 , it is beneficial to sacrifice coverage at high rapidity to make the trap deeper . for a 10 kton trap ,",
    "the trap is sufficiently thick that the best results are achieved for slightly higher beam energies where more of the isr / beamstrahlung tail may be caught .",
    "for a 10 kton trap , we find that the optimal trap configuration has @xmath138 and @xmath137 .    for all trap sizes , however , the number of trapped sleptons is maximized for beam energies near the 475 gev threshold .",
    "the tunable beam energy and well - defined initial state are well - known virtues of the ilc , but these are exploited in a qualitatively novel way here to produce slow nlsp sleptons that may be easily caught .",
    "relative to the case at the lhc , a much larger fraction of the produced staus can be caught .",
    "for example , of the 2650 staus produced at @xmath139 in a year , 2000 staus may be trapped in an optimized 10 kton water trap !",
    "such results imply promising prospects for slepton trapping even in the minimal case when the only superpartner accessible at the ilc is the nlsp slepton .    before considering the msugra model",
    ", we note that the number of produced staus continues to rise well beyond its value at @xmath140 .",
    "this suggests that our results may be improved significantly by placing some dense material between the ilc detector and the water tank . by adding material depth to the ilc detector , the threshold at which sleptons",
    "just barely emerge is moved to higher @xmath130 where the stau pair production cross section is higher . for a dense material , such as lead ,",
    "this can be achieved without increasing @xmath76 much .",
    "such a strategy may in any case be required to smooth out variations in @xmath78 inherent in realistic detectors .",
    "although we have not investigated this in detail , we expect that a large enhancement may be possible .",
    "we now turn to the msugra model . in this model ,",
    "nlsp staus may again be produced directly , but now they may also be produced in several other ways : first , by @xmath141 followed by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , and second , by @xmath144 , followed by @xmath145 , or through the cascade @xmath146 . the energy and @xmath91 distributions of nlsp staus in the msugra model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions_msugra ] .",
    "distributions for staus produced through @xmath33 pair production . ] as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions_msugra ] , the additional sources of staus increase the total number of staus significantly , but just as significant , the cascade decays produce a broad and flat tail in the energy distribution extending nearly down to @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath91 distribution is nevertheless still peaked at @xmath109 .    the number of trapped staus per year for the msugra model are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ilcresults_msugra ] .",
    "the presence of additional accessible superpartner states has a significant impact  for all trap sizes considered , large numbers of staus may be trapped even for beam energies well above 475 gev .",
    "this is a consequence of the broad energy distribution of nlsp staus , which in turn follows from the existence of other fairly degenerate superpartners .    in the msugra case , we may also compare these ilc results directly with results from the lhc analysis given above . the lhc results for @xmath108 from sec .",
    "[ sec : lhc ] are given by the lines marked `` lhc '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : ilcresults_msugra ] . comparing results of similarly - sized water traps",
    ", we find that for this particular model , the ilc will be able to trap a factor of @xmath148 more staus than the lhc .",
    "again , for the reasons discussed above , a significant enhancement of these ilc results may be possible if one considers inserting lead between the ilc detector and the water trap , and as many as @xmath149 staus may be trapped by reasonably sized water traps using this more general approach .",
    "although the implications of supergravity for cosmology and particle physics have been considered in great detail for decades , most work has been centered on scenarios in which the lsp is a standard model superpartner .",
    "here we have explored the gravitino lsp scenario .",
    "recent work has found significant cosmological motivations for this possibility , as the gravitino may explain dark matter , and the scenario may resolve current difficulties in big bang nucleosynthesis and with leptogenesis .",
    "we considered here a novel implication for collider physics , namely that nlsp sleptons may be collected in water traps before their decays to the gravitino .",
    "these sleptons may then be concentrated and transported to some quiet environment where their decays may be studied in detail .    by optimizing the water trap shape and placement and considering a variety of sizes ,",
    "we have first explored the prospects for trapping sleptons at the lhc .",
    "the number that may be trapped is highly model - dependent . for minimal supergravity with @xmath150 , we find that as many as @xmath127 staus may be stopped in a 10 kton trap when the sleptons have mass around 100 gev .",
    "this is as light as is allowed by current bounds . for a less optimistic scenario ,",
    "say , with 219 gev staus , hundreds and tens of sleptons may be trapped each year in 10 kton and 1 kton traps , respectively .",
    "these results may be improved significantly if long - lived nlsp sleptons are kinematically accessible at the ilc . for the identical case with 219 gev sleptons discussed above",
    ", @xmath151 sleptons may be trapped each year in a 10 kton trap .",
    "if only the nlsp is accessible , this result may be achieved by tuning the beam energy so that produced nlsps barely escape the ilc detector . the ability to prepare initial states with well - known energies and the flexibility to tune this energy are well - known advantages of the ilc . here",
    ", these features are exploited in a qualitatively new way to produce slow sleptons that are easily captured .",
    "if there are additional superpartner states accessible at the ilc , even tuning the beam energy is not necessary .",
    "the cascade decays of other superpartner states produce a broad distribution of slepton energies , and so for a broad range of beam energies , some sleptons will be captured in the trap .",
    "we have noted also that , by considering the slightly more general possibility of placing lead or other dense material between the ilc detector and the slepton trap , an order of magnitude enhancement may be possible , allowing up to @xmath118 sleptons to be trapped per ilc year .",
    "the analysis here is valid with minor revisions for traps composed of any material . for concreteness , however , we have considered traps composed of water tanks , with the expectation that sleptons caught in water will be easily concentrated and/or moved to quiet environments .",
    "these results imply that high precision studies of slepton decays may be possible .",
    "there are many significant implications of such studies .",
    "these have been considered in detail in refs .",
    "briefly , simply by counting the number of slepton decays as a function of time , the slepton lifetime may be determined with high accuracy . given thousands of sleptons ,",
    "we expect a determination at the few percent level . the slepton decay width of eq .",
    "( [ sfermionwidth ] ) is a simple function of the slepton and gravitino masses , and the slepton mass will be constrained by analysis of the collider event kinematics , a measurement of the slepton width therefore implies a high precision measurement of the gravitino mass and , through eq .",
    "( [ gravitinomass ] ) , the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath152 .",
    "such measurements will provide precision determinations of the relic density of superwimp gravitino dark matter , the contribution of supersymmetry breaking to vacuum energy , and the opportunity for laboratory studies of late decay phenomena relevant for big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the gravitino mass may also be determined , although not necessarily on an event - by - event basis , by measuring the energy of slepton decay products .",
    "this provides a consistency check .",
    "alternatively , these two methods , when combined , determine not only @xmath25 , but also the planck mass @xmath9 .",
    "this then provides a precision measurement of newton s constant on unprecedentedly small scales , and the opportunity for a quantitative test of supergravity relations .",
