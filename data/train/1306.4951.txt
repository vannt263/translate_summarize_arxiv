    "elastic electron scattering is the primary tool for measuring the nucleon electromagnetic form factors which , in turn , reflect the internal structure of the nucleon and dynamics of the strong interaction inside it .",
    "there are two main methods for measuring the form factors : standard rosenbluth separation method and modern polarization transfer method ( used since 1998 @xcite ) .",
    "it was realized about ten years ago that these two methods are in serious disagreement with respect to the proton form factor ratio @xmath5 at high @xmath3 @xcite . while the rosenbluth method indicated that @xmath6 , the polarization data suggested that the ratio decreases almost linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "this disagreement was further confirmed with increased precision experiments , using both rosenbluth @xcite and polarization @xcite techniques .",
    "it was suggested that the discrepancy may be due to data analysis done in the born approximation , thus leaving out non - trivial higher - order terms , such as two - photon exchange ( tpe ) .",
    "indeed , first calculations had shown @xcite , that the discrepancy is , at least partially , resolved by including tpe corrections .",
    "besides that , there is now much experimental activity , aimed at the direct observation of tpe effects in the @xmath7 scattering .",
    "this includes experiments which are already completed @xcite , in progress @xcite , approved or proposed @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review on experimental and theoretical studies of tpe in @xmath8 and other processes , along with bibliography , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two mainline approaches to the theoretical evaluation of the tpe amplitude : `` quark '' and `` hadronic '' ones . in the `` quark '' approach , as its name suggests",
    ", the nucleon is viewed as an ensemble of quarks ( partons ) , interacting according to qcd @xcite .",
    "naturally , the applicability of this approach is limited to the high-@xmath3 region . despite all its advantages ,",
    "the serious drawback is that it is hard to calculate the tpe correction to the electric form factor @xmath9 in this approach , while this is surely needed for the correct interpretation of @xmath5 measurements .    in the `` hadronic '' approach tpe",
    "is mediated by the production of virtual hadrons and/or hadronic resonances .",
    "the tpe amplitudes are broken into different contributions according to the intermediate state involved .",
    "the most important and well - established one is the elastic contribution , which corresponds to pure nucleon intermediate state . in turn",
    ", all other contributions are called inelastic . among them , the contributions of some prominent resonances [ @xmath2 and others ] were studied in refs .  @xcite . in refs .  @xcite it was shown that their overall effect _ on the cross - section _ is smaller than that of the elastic contribution , with @xmath2 yielding its main part and the contributions of other resonances partially cancelling each other .",
    "later , it was found @xcite that @xmath2 yields relatively large correction to the @xmath5 form factor ratio at high @xmath3 ( far exceeding that of the elastic intermediate state ) , and that the correction grows with @xmath3 .",
    "this result suggests that the contributions of other inelastic states may also be important and at least should be estimated carefully .",
    "unfortunately , all the above - mentioned papers use `` zero - width '' approximation , i.e. widths of resonances are assumed to be negligibly small .",
    "this approximation seems rather crude , especially for @xmath2 , since its width ( @xmath10 ) is comparable to the distance from the threshold ( @xmath11 ) .    to overcome this issue , in the present paper we estimate the inelastic contribution to the tpe amplitude , arising from the @xmath0 ( pion+nucleon ) intermediate states",
    "this may be viewed as a significant improvement of the previous `` resonance '' calculations , since most resonances have dominant @xmath0 content .",
    "consequently , the advantages of our approach are    * automatically having correct resonance width * automatically having correct resonance shape * including not only resonances but background as well    the @xmath0 contribution may further be split into the contributions of different partial waves of the @xmath0 system .",
    "though , in principle , all partial waves may be taken into account in our method , it is particularly useful for the @xmath1 channel , where @xmath12 resides .",
    "the @xmath12 resonance has almost 100% @xmath0 content , thus we will get pure improvement w.r.t . previous works .",
    "the situation is not so simple for other resonances , such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , since they have significant @xmath15 branching ratio ; the corresponding contribution will be missing in the present approach .",
    "only @xmath1 channel will be considered in full detail further .",
    "the idea of the present calculation is the following .",
    "the @xmath0 system is fully described by its isospin , spin - parity , and invariant mass .",
    "no other internal quantum numbers exist .",
    "thus , with respect to the calculation of the tpe amplitudes , the @xmath0 system in the intermediate state is fully equivalent to the single particle with the same isospin , spin - parity and mass ( and properly defined transition amplitudes ) .",
    "if we are able to calculate the tpe contribution of the resonance with given quantum numbers , we can do precisely the same thing for the @xmath0 system of fixed invariant mass and then integrate over invariant masses .    specifically ,",
    "if , for the zero - width particle @xmath16 ( resonance ) with mass @xmath17 and @xmath18 transition form factor @xmath19 we have [ gentpe ] ^r = a^r(q_1 ^ 2 ) a^r(q_2 ^ 2 ) k(m_r , q_1",
    "^ 2,q_2 ^ 2 ) dq_1 ^ 2 dq_2 ^ 2 ( where @xmath20 stands for any tpe amplitude , and @xmath21 is some kernel , irrelevant for the following discussion ) , then the full contribution of the @xmath0 partial wave with the same quantum numbers will be [ gentpepin ] ^n = dw^2 , where the integration variable @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system and @xmath23 is appropriately defined transition form factor . note that @xmath24 stands for the square of virtual photon momentum and should not be confused with the total momentum transfer in the elastic process , @xmath3 .    for the @xmath1 channel , all needed formulae [ eq.([gentpe ] ) ]",
    "are already derived @xcite .",
    "all we have to do is to establish a correspondence between the transition form factors , used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the multipole amplitudes for the production of the @xmath0 system .",
    "the pion electroproduction is commonly described by the multipole amplitudes @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , which are functions of @xmath24 and @xmath22 ; the subscript @xmath28 is pion orbital quantum number and @xmath29 indicates the total angular momentum @xmath30 .",
    "one can also define helicity amplitudes as follows ( see e.g. @xcite ) : [ mult2ah ] a_1/2 & = & -12 , + a_3/2 & = & 12 , + s_1/2 & = & - ( j+1/2 ) s_l .",
    "thus we have three `` flavours '' of the transition amplitude : @xmath31 for the single narrow resonance , @xmath32 for the @xmath0 system , and @xmath23 for the `` effective resonances '' describing @xmath0 continuum . as one can guess , the amplitudes @xmath23 , which are to be put into eq .",
    "( [ gentpepin ] ) , can differ from @xmath32 [ eq .",
    "( [ mult2ah ] ) ] only in overall @xmath24-independent factor , which arises from different normalizations of resonance and @xmath0 states .",
    "thus , the factor can easily be determined by considering forward kinematics , where the imaginary part of the tpe amplitudes is related to the cross - section via the optical theorem .",
    "nevertheless , a straightforward calculation ( in arbitrary kinematics ) is certainly possible , and to be rigorous , we perform such calculation in the appendix .",
    "the sought relation is [ ahfactor ] a_h^n ( q^2,w ) = a_h(q^2,w ) , where @xmath33 is the nucleon mass , @xmath34 is the pion momentum in the @xmath0 c.m.s . , and we use the shorthand @xmath35 for any of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . now",
    "the argument from the beginning of this section applies , and the tpe amplitudes will be given by eq .",
    "( [ gentpepin ] ) .",
    "the apparent dimension mismatch between @xmath39 and @xmath35 is not an error , recall that the dimension of @xmath35 is @xmath40 , the dimension of @xmath41 , meant in eq .",
    "( [ gentpe ] ) , is @xmath42 , and eq .",
    "( [ gentpepin ] ) contains additional integration over @xmath43 .    for actual calculation of the tpe amplitudes",
    "we wish to employ the tpecalc program @xcite . however , both tpecalc and ref .",
    "@xcite use not @xmath35 , but covariant form factors @xmath44 to describe nucleon - resonance transition .",
    "the latter are related to the transition current matrix element for @xmath18 as term is incorrect . ]",
    "n|j^|r = ( g^ q^- g^ q^ ) |u _ 5 v _ , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are resonance and photon momenta , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are nucleon and resonance spinors , the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 are normalized to unity and the resonance mass is taken to be @xmath22 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath51 can be obtained using the definitions of @xmath35 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs.(31 - 33 ) ) and reads : [ ah2fi ] k f_1 & = & [ ( w - m)^2-q^2](a_3/2 + a_1/2 ) , + k f_2 & = & [ w^2-m^2+q^2](a_3/2 - a_1/2 ) + 2q^2 s_1/2 , + k f_3 & = & 2w^2(a_3/2 - a_1/2 ) + [ w^2-m^2+q^2 ] s_1/2 , where @xmath52 is photon momentum in the resonance rest frame , and k = [ ( w+m)^2-q^2][(w - m)^2-q^2 ] . in full analogy to @xmath35 , the form factors @xmath51 should be then `` renormalized '' according to eq .",
    "( [ ahfactor ] ) , [ fifactor ] f_i^n ( q^2,w ) = f_i(q^2,w ) .",
    "note that , though for a single narrow resonance @xmath51 are purely real , the calculation of the tpe amplitudes is well possible when they are complex ; the latter is obviously the case here , since the amplitudes @xmath35 are complex .",
    "the multipole amplitudes @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 were taken from the unitary isobar model maid2007 @xcite ; the numerical values were downloaded from the dedicated website @xcite for @xmath24 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in steps of @xmath55 and @xmath22 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 in steps of @xmath58 .",
    "note that the site gives the amplitudes for the isospin channels , named @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath62 , which we need here , are @xmath63 .",
    "then , for each discrete @xmath22 value @xmath64 , the multipole amplitudes were converted into the helicity amplitudes @xmath35 [ eq.([mult2ah ] ) ] , and then into the transition form factors @xmath65 [ eqs.([ah2fi ] ) and ( [ fifactor ] ) ] . much like it was described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the resulting form factors were fitted with the sum of poles : f(q^2,w_i ) = _",
    "j=1 ^ 7 , where @xmath66 are complex and @xmath67 are real parameters , with the restrictions @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the tpe contributions were then calculated : at first for each individual @xmath22 value , following procedures described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; and finally they were integrated over @xmath22 ( with the rectangle method ) , yielding the total @xmath70 contribution .    to get an impression of the numerical integration errors , we choose several representative kinematical points , and for that points , tried to    * vary sampling step in @xmath22 ( between 5 , 10 and 15 mev ) * use simpson s rule instead of the rectangle method    in all cases the tpe amplitudes changed by no more than 2 - 3% , which is small enough ( note that since we are anyway using an expansion in @xmath71 , no more than @xmath72 accuracy is needed ) .    another source of uncertainty is the choice of the upper integration limit in @xmath22 . in principle",
    ", we should integrate up to infinity , but for a numerical calculation we have to choose some finite value , and 1550 mev was used in most calculations . to probe the error resulting from cutting the integral off",
    ", we try to extend the integration limit from 1550 mev to 1750 mev or 2 gev ( note that the maid multipoles only exist up to @xmath73 ) .",
    "again , the change in the tpe amplitudes was no more than 3% , except in high-@xmath3 region",
    ". if @xmath3 is high ( @xmath74 ) , then increasing upper integration limit changes the tpe amplitudes by about 5 - 7% .",
    "though such precision is still quite acceptable , this implies that the role of the intermediate states with higher masses increases with @xmath3 .",
    "as usual , we describe tpe by three invariant amplitudes ( generalized form factors ) @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the corrections to the cross - section or polarization observables can be expressed in terms of these amplitudes ; for all relevant formulae see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are three kinematical regions , where it is interesting to look at newly calculated @xmath70 contribution :    * the low-@xmath3 region , which might affect proton radius extraction * the vicinity of the resonance , where the zero - width approximation fails * the high-@xmath3 region , where previous works have revealed the substantial growth of the tpe corrections to the @xmath78 polarization ratio .    at low @xmath3",
    "the @xmath0 contributions are small ( w.r.t .",
    "the elastic contribution ) and change moderately with @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowq2 ] ) , thus the proton radius extraction is not affected by the @xmath0 intermediate states .",
    "the tpe amplitudes in the resonance region are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] .",
    "just as it was expected , there are smooth bumps at the resonance position , instead of the sharp peaks , which are seen in the zero - width approximation @xcite ( dashed lines ) .    figure [ fig : q2 ] shows @xmath3 dependence of the calculated tpe amplitudes at fixed @xmath79 for @xmath3 up to @xmath80 . the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite is shown with dashed lines for comparison .",
    "we see that for @xmath3 below @xmath81 the two approaches give very similar results . for higher @xmath3 , again in the agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitude @xmath75 dominates and grows with @xmath3 ( though its numerical value is somewhat smaller ) ; on contrary , the amplitudes @xmath76 and @xmath77 have quite different values here and in ref .",
    "when comparing these numerical values , one must keep in mind that present approach differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in several aspects :    * now we include @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 multipole amplitudes , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite effectively includes only @xmath83 amplitude ( magnetic transition ) * the resonance shape differs from pure breit - wigner * the background contribution is included    this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm ] , which shows the amplitude @xmath76 , calculated in three ways :    * in the present approach , * in the present approach with magnetic transition only ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 transition form factors set to zero ) , * in the approach of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we see that the difference mainly results from neglecting electric transition in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a similar way we have found that the difference of the amplitude @xmath75 in the two approaches is mainly due to neglecting @xmath12 resonance width .",
    "( theoretically , the difference also could result from the contribution of states with higher @xmath22 s , which are missing in `` narrow @xmath12 '' calculation .",
    "however , actually this contribution is small , see the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : tech ] ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] we plot the tpe correction to the polarization ratio . at high @xmath3",
    "we see the same behaviour which was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the correction grows rapidly with @xmath3 .",
    "numerically the correction is @xmath87 smaller than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the reasons discussed above ) .",
    "we have considered the inelastic tpe contribution , originating from @xmath0 intermediate states , and , specifically , the @xmath1 partial wave .",
    "thus we effectively include @xmath2 resonance and take into account its finite width .",
    "numerically we obtain the following results :    * at small @xmath3 this contribution is small ( negligible w.r.t .",
    "the elastic one ) * the tpe amplitudes have smooth maxima at the resonance position ( @xmath88 ) * at high @xmath3 we confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained with the zero - width @xmath12 .",
    "the main correction comes to the generalized electric form factor .",
    "this correction ( and , consequently , the correction to the polarization ratio ) is relatively large and grows with @xmath3 .",
    "its numerical value is somewhat smaller than in ref .",
    "@xcite    in summary , we see , that ( contrary to the common belief ) the tpe corrections to the polarization ratio are not negligible at high @xmath3 .",
    "the question which remains open is : whether the contributions of partial waves other than @xmath1 are small or not , how many of them should be taken into account , and how large is the error , resulting from leaving out partial waves with higher spins .",
    "surely , it is desirable to answer this question before the tpe corrections are applied to experimental data .",
    "however , this is a separate task , and we plan to do it in further papers .",

    "<S> we consider two - photon exchange ( tpe ) in the elastic electron - proton scattering and evaluate the effect of @xmath0 ( pion + nucleon ) intermediate hadronic states . among different @xmath0 states , </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the @xmath1 channel ; thus we effectively include @xmath2 resonance with realistic width and shape and corresponding background as well . in agreement with the previous result , obtained for the zero - width resonance , </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the tpe correction to the electric form factor is the largest one ; it grows with @xmath3 and at @xmath4 exceeds the corresponding elastic contribution . </S>"
