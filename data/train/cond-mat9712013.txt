    "the hamiltonian for a many - electron system is given by ( in atomic units @xmath1 ) @xmath2+\\frac 12\\sum_{i\\ne j}% \\frac 1{|{\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j|}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a local external potential such as the field from the nuclei .",
    "solving the above hamiltonian has been a major problem in molecular and condensed matter physics .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the last term makes the hamiltonian difficult to solve . for a small system , such as an atom or a small molecule , it is possible to obtain the many - particle ground - state wavefunction by means of the configuration interaction ( ci ) method ( boys 1950 , dykstra 1988 ) . in this method",
    "the wavefunction is expanded as a sum of slater determinants ( slater 1930 ) whose orbitals and coefficients are determined by minimizing the total energy . a very accurate ground state wavefunction and energy can be obtained .",
    "the computational effort , however , scales exponentially with the system size so that applications to large molecules or solids are not feasible . for excited states",
    ", the computational effort becomes very large already for a small system .",
    "fortunately , in practice we are interested in quantities which do not require the full knowledge of the wavefunctions .",
    "for example , we are interested in the total energy , excitation spectra and expectation values of single - particle operators which can be obtained from the green function described in a later section .",
    "approximate theories are usually concerned with finding a good single - particle approximation for the coulomb term .",
    "the earliest of these theories is the hartree approximation ( 1928 ) where the non - local coulomb term is replaced by an average local coulomb potential ( hartree potential ) from all the electrons .",
    "although it gives reasonable results , due to a cancellation between exchange and correlation , the hartree theory is not accurate enough in many cases .",
    "an extension of the hartree theory which takes into account the fermionic nature of the electrons leads to the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) ( fock 1930 ) where in addition to the average local coulomb potential there is a non - local exchange potential which reflects the pauli exclusion principle . for systems with an energy gap in their excitation spectra ,",
    "the hfa gives a qualitatively reasonable result .",
    "in fact the hfa works quite well for atoms but for insulating solids , the energy gap is in most cases too large .",
    "the reason for this can be traced back to the neglect of correlations or screening which is not too important in atoms but crucial in solids .",
    "the hfa already takes into account to a large extent correlation between electrons of the same spin since the pauli exclusion principle ( exchange ) prevents them to get close together .",
    "two electrons of opposite spin on the other hand are allowed to occupy the same single - particle state at the cost of a large coulomb energy .",
    "correlations keep electrons away from each other , creating a screening hole around each electron which reduces the interaction with the other electrons and thereby the coulomb energy . the energy cost of transferring an electron from one site to a neighbouring site is substantially reduced by screening . in the tight - binding limit ,",
    "i.e. for localized states , the energy gap is approximately given by @xmath4 and this is essentially the effective coulomb energy of the states that form the gap .",
    "thus , correlation or screening reduces the gap from its hartree - fock value . in metals ,",
    "the absence of correlations in the hfa leads to qualitatively wrong results such as zero density of states at the fermi level due to a logarithmic singularity in the derivative of the single - particle spectra with respect to @xmath5 at @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , ashcroft and mermin 1976 ) .    to simulate the effect of correlations , slater introduced the @xmath7 method where the exchange potential is modelled by a local potential of the form @xmath8 , derived from the electron gas and scaled by a constant @xmath9 to simulate correlations",
    "@xmath10 is the local electron density ( slater 1951a , 1951b , 1953 , 1974 ) .",
    "this method has been quite successful in calculating ground - state properties and excitation spectra but it is semiempirical . the @xmath11 theory may be regarded as a precursor of the modern density functional theory ( dft ) ( hohenberg and kohn 1964 , kohn and sham 1965 ) which has become a standard method for calculating ground - state properties of molecules and solids .",
    "recent reviews on dft may be found in jones and gunnarsson ( 1989 ) and dreizler and gross ( 1990 ) . in dft",
    ", the ground - state energy can be shown to be a functional of the ground - state density and satisfies the variational principle with respect to the density .",
    "the explicit form of the functional in terms of the density is not known and such an explicit functional may not exist . using the variational property of the energy functional , one arrives at a set of single - particle equations , the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations ( kohn and sham 1965 ) , to be solved self - consistently : @xmath12\\phi _ i=\\varepsilon _ i\\phi _ i\\ ] ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the hartree and exchange - correlation potential respectively . in practical applications , the functional containing the effects of exchange and correlations",
    "is approximated by the local density approximation ( lda ) where the density in the exchange - correlation potential of the electron gas is replaced by the local density of the real system ( kohn and sham 1965 ) .",
    "the ks eigenvalues @xmath16 have no clear physical meaning except for the highest occupied which corresponds to the ionization energy ( almbladh and von barth 1985a ) .",
    "although there is no theoretical justification , they are often interpreted as single - particle excitation energies corresponding to excitation spectra of the system upon a removal or addition of an electron . in many cases , in particular in sp systems",
    ", the agreement with photoemission spectra is quite good but as will be described in the next section , there are also serious discrepancies .    a proper way of calculating single - particle excitation energies or quasiparticle energies ( landau 1956 , 1957 ) is provided by the green function theory ( galitskii and migdal 1958 , galitskii 1958 ) .",
    "it can be shown that the quasiparticle energies @xmath17 can be obtained from the quasiparticle equation : @xmath18\\psi _ i({\\bf r } ) + \\int d^3r^{\\prime } \\;\\sigma({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^{\\prime } ; e_i)\\psi _",
    "i({\\bf r}% ^{\\prime } ) = e_i\\psi _ i({\\bf r } )   \\label{qpenergyeqn}\\ ] ] the non - local and energy dependent potential @xmath19 , or the self - energy , contains the effects of exchange and correlations .",
    "it is in general complex with the imaginary part describing the damping of the quasiparticle .",
    "it can be seen that the different single - particle theories amount to approximating the self - energy operator @xmath19 .",
    "calculations of @xmath19 are unfortunately very difficult even for the electron gas",
    ". we must resort to approximations and this review describes the @xmath0 approximation ( gwa ) ( hedin 1965a ) which is the simplest working approximation beyond the hfa that takes screening into account .",
    "the lda has been very successful for describing ground - state properties such as total energies and structural properties .",
    "there is no clear theoretical justification why the lda ks eigenvalues should give excitation energies , and even the exact @xmath15 is not supposed to give the exact quasiparticle energies .",
    "nevertheless , the lda ks eigenvalues are often found to be in good agreement with the quasiparticle energies measured in photoemission experiments . despite of its success",
    ", there are serious discrepancies already in sp - systems and they become worse in d- and f - systems :    * the band width in na is 10 - 20 % too large , 3.2 ev in lda @xmath20 2.65 ev experimentally ( see , however , section v - a for the experimental band width ) . * the band gaps in semiconductors si , gaas , ge , etc . are systematically underestimated , as much as 100 % in ge . *",
    "the band width in ni is @xmath21 30 % too large , 4.5 ev in lda @xmath20 3.3 ev experimentally ( hfner _ et al _ 1972 , himpsel , knapp , and eastman 1979 ) * in f - systems , the lda density of states is in strong disagreement with experiment . * in the mott - hubbard insulators of transition metal oxides the lda band gap is much too small ( powell and spicer 1970 , hfner _",
    "et al _ 1984 , sawatzky and allen 1984 ) and in some cases the lda gives @xmath22 wrong results .",
    "for example , the mott - hubbard insulators coo and the undoped parent compound of the high @xmath23 material la@xmath24cuo@xmath25 are predicted to be metals ( see e.g. pickett 1989 ) * the magnetic moments in the transition metal oxides are systematically underestimated ( alperin 1962 , fender _ et al _ 1968 , cheetham and hope 1983 ) * in alkali - metal clusters , the ionization energies calculated within the lda are too low compared to experiment ( ishii , ohnishi , and sugano 1986 , saito and cohen 1988 ) . * in the lda , the image potential seen by an electron in the vacuum far from a surface decays exponentially instead of the expected @xmath26 decay where @xmath27 is the coordinate normal to the surface and @xmath28 is the position of the image plane ( lang and kohn 1973 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , one should not blame the lda for all of these discrepancies since many of them are related to excited state properties which are outside the domain of dft . however , excited state properties of finite systems can be calculated within the time - dependent extension of dft ( runge and gross 1984 , gross , dobson , and petersilka 1996 ) .      when discussing theories beyond the lda , a distinction should be made between theories which attempt to find better energy functionals but which lie within dft and those theories which attempt to mimic the self - energy in order to obtain better quasiparticle energies but which are then usually outside dft .",
    "the gwa belongs to the latter .",
    "since the lda is based on the homogeneous electron gas , it is natural to take into account the inhomogeneity in the charge density of real systems by including gradient corrections in the energy functional .",
    "there are two main approaches .",
    "the first is a semiempirical approach where the exchange - correlation functional is modelled by a functional containing parameters which are adjusted to give the best fit to the cohesive energies of a number of  standard molecules  .",
    "the most successful of these models are due to becke ( 1988 , 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "the other approach attempts to calculate the coefficients in the gradient expansion from first principles ( langreth and mehl 1983 , svendsen and von barth 1996 , springer , svendsen , and von barth 1996 , for a recent development see perdew , burke , and ernzerhof 1997 and references therein ) . while in general gradient corrections give a significant improvement in the total energy ( causa and zupan 1994 , philipsen and baerends 1996 , dal corso 1996 ) there is almost no major improvement for quasiparticle energies ( dufek _ et al _ 1994 ) .",
    "one of the problems with the lda is the absence of orbital dependence in the exchange - correlation potential . since the potential does not distinguish between orbitals with different @xmath29-quantum numbers , for systems containing a partially filled d- or f - shell one obtains a corresponding partially filled band with a metallic type electronic structure unless the exchange and crystal field splitting create a gap between the up and down channel",
    "thus , the late transition metal oxides , which are insulators , are predicted to be metals by the ( nonspin - polarized ) lda . in the lda+u method ( anisimov , zaanen , and andersen 1991 , anisimov _ et al _ 1993 , lichtenstein , zaanen , and anisimov 1995 ) and its generalization ( solovyev , dederichs , and anisimov 1994 , solovyev , hamada , and terakura 1996 ) , an orbital dependent potential u acting only on localized d- or f - states is introduced on top of the lda potential . for mott - hubbard insulators or rare earth metal compounds where the partially filled 3d or 4f bands are split by the coulomb interaction , forming the upper and lower hubbard band , the lda+u works reasonably well ( anisimov _ et al _ 1997 ) .",
    "the bandstructure , however , is unsatisfactory .",
    "another problem with the method arises for systems with partially filled @xmath30 shells which are metallic , like the transition metals . in this case",
    ", the lda+u would produce unphysical results since it would split the partially filled band .",
    "apart from the problem with orbital dependence in the lda , there is another problem associated with an unphysical interaction of an electron with itself . in dft , only the highest occupied state is free from self - interaction but in lda , there is in general self - interaction for all states .",
    "this self - interaction is explicitly subtracted out in the sic formalism resulting in an orbital - dependent potential ( cowan 1967 , lindgren 1971 , zunger _",
    "et al _ 1980 , perdew and zunger 1981 ) .",
    "self - interaction is significant for localized states and it tends to zero for extended states since in the latter case the charge is spread over the crystal and therefore the coulomb interaction of an electron with itself is of order @xmath31 . since self - interaction is usually positive , one would expect the lda eigenvalues for localized states to be too high , as is indeed the case . for atoms ,",
    "sic therefore lowers the lda eigenvalues giving better agreement with experiment .",
    "the orbital - dependent potential in sic can describe mott - hubbard insulators although the bandstructure is not likely to be satisfactory .",
    "sic predicts all the 3d monoxides to be insulators except vo which is correctly predicted to be a metal ( svane and gunnarsson 1990 , szotek , temmerman , and winter 1993 , arai and fujiwara 1995 ) .",
    "sic however fails to give a delocalized paramagnetic solution for the doped high @xmath32 compounds and a similar problem is anticipated in lda+u . for more itinerant systems , sic does not give localized solutions , and it then reduces to the lda .",
    "accordingly , application to semiconductors , e.g. si , does not increase the lda gap .",
    "a recent attempt to improve the lda description of quasiparticle energies is to choose a non - interacting reference system having the same ground - state density as the real system , like in the conventional ks scheme , but with a non - local potential ( seidl _ et al _ 1996 ) .",
    "since the potential is non - local , the choice is not unique , different non - local potentials may generate the same ground - state density .",
    "a particular choice is a non - local screened exchange potential minus its local form . by definition ,",
    "the functional from which this potential is derived , is zero at the correct density .",
    "the ks equations consist of the usual lda exchange - correlation potential plus the chosen non - local potential . for semiconductors",
    "si , gaas , ge , inp and insb , this method improves the values of the band gap .",
    "applications to other systems have not been performed so far .",
    "another recent scheme proposed by engel and pickett ( 1996 ) incorporates part of the correlation energy into the kinetic energy functional which may be thought of as mass renormalization .",
    "this scheme is shown to improve the description of band gaps in silicon and germanium but it gives negligible correction for diamond and carbon .      a natural way of improving the lda would be to calculate the exchange energy exactly and to generate a local exchange potential by taking a functional derivative of the exchange energy functional with respect to the density ( kotani 1995 , kotani and akai 1996 , bylander and kleinman 1995a , b ) .",
    "the correlation energy can be approximated by the lda value .",
    "the original idea of this method is due to talman and shadwick ( 1976 ) in their work on atoms where the hartree - fock total energy is minimized with orbitals restricted to be solutions to single - particle hamiltonians with local potentials .",
    "the scheme is also known as the optimized effective potential method .",
    "applications of this approach to several semiconductors and insulators ( c , si , ge , mgo , cao , and mno ) yields encouraging results regarding the band gaps which in most cases are improved from the corresponding lda values . however , the scheme is still within the density functional formalism and it is intended to improve the energy functional rather than the self - energy .",
    "one advantage of this scheme is the possibility to systematically improve the energy functional . with regard to _ gw",
    "_ calculations , the scheme may provide better starting points than the lda .",
    "the scheme may be extended to include correlations by using a screened interaction potential .",
    "the theories described above have drawbacks when applied to calculating quasiparticle energies .",
    "gradient corrections attempt to improve total energies but do not address the problem of improving quasiparticle energies .",
    "indeed , applications to transition metal oxides , where the gap is zero or grossly underestimated by the lda , do not give any significant improvement .",
    "sic theory only applies to localized occupied states and numerical calculations show that the resulting eigenvalues are too low .",
    "the lda+u is designed for systems with localized states split by the coulomb correlation , forming the upper and lower hubbard band .",
    "applications to transition metals , however , would lead to unreasonable results .",
    "the generalized ks scheme using screened exchange , like the other theories discussed above , has no energy dependence which can be important in some cases .",
    "moreover , the choice of the non - local potential is rather arbitrary . since the theory has not been applied extensively , it is difficult to judge its usefulness .",
    "the exact exchange approach should in principle improve total energies when correlations are also taken into account but it does not address the lda problems with quasiparticles .    the gwa is derived systematically from many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the form of the self - energy in the gwa is the same as in the hfa but the coulomb interaction is dynamically screened , remedying the most serious deficiency of the hfa .",
    "the self - energy in the gwa is therefore non - local and energy dependent .",
    "the gwa is physically sound because it is qualitatively correct in some limiting cases ( hedin 1995 ) which allows applications to a large class of materials , metals or insulators .    * in atoms , screening is small and the gwa approaches the hfa which is known to work well for atoms . * in the electron gas , screening is very important which is taken into account in the gwa and for semiconductors it can be shown that the gwa reduces the hartree - fock gaps . * for a core electron excitation , the gwa corresponds to the classical coulomb relaxation energy of the other electrons due to the adiabatic switching - on of the core hole potential , which is just what is to be expected physically .",
    "* for a rydberg electron in an atom , the gwa gives the classical coulomb energy of the rydberg electron due to the adiabatic switching - on of an induced dipole in the ion core .",
    "* for the decay rate and the energy loss per unit time of a fast electron in an electron gas , the gwa gives the correct formula .",
    "the gwa has been applied with success to a wide class of systems ranging from simple metals to transition metals and their compounds .",
    "so far , the gwa has been applied mainly to calculate single - particle excitation spectra , but it is also possible to calculate the total energy ( lundqvist and samathiyakanit 1969 , von barth and holm 1997 , farid , godby , and needs 1990 ) and the expectation value of any single - particle operator in the ground state .      the earliest attempt to include correlations beyond the hfa in the form of @xmath0 theory was probably the work of quinn and ferrell ( 1958 ) for the electron gas . their calculations , however , were limited to states around the fermi energy and several approximations were made .",
    "dubois ( 1959a , 1959b ) also calculated the self - energy of the electron gas within a @xmath0 type theory but his calculations were only for small values of the electron gas parameter @xmath33 or for high densities since @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the electron density .",
    "his results have therefore received less attention because they are not directly relevant to real metals which have @xmath36 ( al @xmath37 2 , cs @xmath37 5 ) .",
    "the first full calculation of the self - energy within the gwa for the electron gas was performed by hedin ( 1965a ) .",
    "he also showed in a systematic and rigorous way how the self - energy can be expanded in powers of the dynamically screened coulomb interaction , with the gwa as the first term in this expansion .",
    "later on , lundqvist ( 1967a , 1967b , 1968 ) did extensive calculations of the self - energy of the electron gas for various densities and studied the spectral functions .",
    "rice ( 1965 ) used a different version of what is conventionally known as the gwa , including vertex corrections ( corrections beyond the gwa ) .",
    "his results are similar to those of hedin .",
    "later on , mahan and his group ( mahan and sernelius 1989 , frota and mahan 1992 ) performed extensive self - energy calculations for the electron gas using various forms of the @xmath0-type approximations , studying the importance of vertex corrections .    due to computational difficulties ,",
    "the gwa was not applied to real materials until the mid eighties starting with the work of hybertsen and louie ( 1985a , b , 1986 , 1987b ) on semiconductors with encouraging results . at about the same time , godby , sham and schlter ( 1986 , 1987a , b , 1988 ) did the same calculations and their results are in good agreement with those of hybertsen and louie ( 1986 ) .",
    "we should also mention an earlier calculation for diamond using the tight - binding approach by strinati , mattausch , and hanke ( 1982 ) although it is superseded by later calculations .",
    "the good results for semiconductors encouraged further applications to more complicated systems , transition metals and their compounds , jellium surface , sodium clusters and to f - systems . by now",
    "the gwa has become a standard method for including correlations beyond the hfa .",
    "in this section we describe a brief summary of the green function theory and derive the gwa . more details on the green function theory",
    "may be found in standard text books on many - body theory ( e.g. nozires 1964 , fetter and walecka 1971 , inkson 1984 , mahan 1990 ) and in the review article by hedin and lundqvist ( 1969 ) .",
    "to study the electronic excitation spectrum of a solid , one performs photoemission experiments where photons with a certain energy @xmath38 are used as projectiles to knock out electrons . by measuring the kinetic energy of the photoemitted electrons along a certain direction @xmath39 and using the conservation of energy and momentum ,",
    "the excitation spectrum @xmath40 of the solid can be obtained : @xmath41 a photoemission experiment then measures the excitation spectrum of a solid with the presence of a hole ( occupied density of states ) . an inverse photoemission experiment or bis uses electrons as probes to measure the unoccupied density of states or the excitation spectrum with an additional electron .    in the limit of large kinetic energy (  sudden approximation  ) ( hedin and lundqvist 1969 ) of the photoemitted or probing electron , the spectrum is directly related to the one - particle green function which is defined as @xmath42|n\\rangle \\\\",

    "thus , the green function describes the photoemission and inverse photoemission processes .    from the green function",

    "most of the error resides in the coulomb - hole term .",
    "the approximation @xmath306 is more severe for the coulomb - hole term than for the screened - exchange term because the coulomb - hole term involves a sum over unoccupied states as well as over occupied states whereas the screened - exchange term involves a sum over occupied states only .",

    "figure [ figalkali ] shows the experimental peak position ( crosses ) as a function of the photon energy together with the prediction of nfe theory ( dashed line ) .",
    "the band narrowing is about a factor of two larger than the narrowing ( 0.27 ev ) predicted by @xmath0 calculations for the electron gas of the appropriate density ( hedin 1965a ) .",
    "although this error is not very large in absolute terms , it raised questions about the accuracy of the gwa for these systems .",
    "in addition a set of essentially dispersionless states were observed close to the fermi energy , which was completely unexpected according to the nfe band structure .",
    "this raised the interesting issue that the alkali metals may have charge density waves ( overhauser 1985 ) .",

    "finally , a calculation was performed using a green function with a certain self - consistency , namely with the lda eigenvalues replaced by the quasi - particle energies .",
    "this led to a further increase of band width narrowing to 0.71 ev .",
    "lyo and plummer ( 1988 ) also observed large effects of including the corrections to the dielectric function in equation ( [ alkali1 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical justification for including such corrections without simultaneously adding vertex corrections is , however , weak .",
    "we notice that the total energy of the system can be expressed in terms of the dielectric function .",
    "the quasi - particle energies can then be obtained by differentiating with respect to the occupation numbers ( rice 1965 ) .",
    "if the dielectric function has the form of equation ( [ alkali1 ] ) , it was shown that there is also a vertex correction of the type ( rice 1965 , ting 1975 , mahan 1994 ) @xmath426 mahan and sernelius ( 1989 ) have extensively tested various corrections to the dielectric function , including the corresponding vertex corrections when calculating the self - energy .",
    "they found that for the electron gas the vertex corrections cancel most of the effects of the corrections of the dielectric function , and the final results are rather close to the original gwa . del sole , reining , and godby ( 1994 ) obtained similar conclusions for si .",
    "the results for the electron gas suggest that there are discrepancies between appropriate self - energy calculations and the peak positions in the photoemission experiments .",
    "0.3 cm    the relation between the peak position in photoemission and the quasiparticle energies was studied by mahan and coworkers in a series of papers , focussing on surface and quasiparticle life - time effects ( shung and mahan 1986 , 1988 , shung _ et al _ 1987 ) .",
    "they studied a model which includes the rapidly varying potential in the surface region as well as lattice potential in the bulk .",
    "the effects of these potentials on the photoemission process were included , while the lattice part of the potential was neglected when calculating the states .",
    "the self - energy was calculated using the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , which gives results that differ slightly from the traditional @xmath0 results .",
    "for instance , the na band width is reduced by 0.37 ev due to this self - energy .",
    "mahan and coworkers furthermore included the effects of the imaginary part of the self - energy of the emitted electron , by using wave function @xmath427 for these electrons which decayed exponentially inside the surface .",
    "finally , the self - energy of the initial state was included as well . due to the exponential decay of @xmath427 , the electron momentum perpendicular to the surface",
    "is not conserved , and there are nonvertical ( non @xmath428-conserving ) transitions .",
    "mahan and coworkers found that the broadening of the initial state and the instrumental resolution as well as the interference between bulk and surface photoemission shift the apparent peak positions towards lower binding energies relative to the quasiparticle energies by about 0.2 - 0.4 ev ( shung and mahan 1988 ) . including these effects as well as the quasiparticle self - energy shifts leads to the filled circles in figure [ figalkali ] . there is a substantial band narrowing relative to the quasiparticle energies ( full line ) and",
    "the agreement with experiment is generally quite good .",
    "this suggests that the gwa gives good quasiparticle energies for na , and that the main reason for the discrepancy between these energies and the photoemission peak positions can be explained by considering the details of the photoemission process .",
    "mahan and coworkers also gave an explanation for the unexpected features close to the fermi energy ( see the essentially dispersionless structure in figure [ figalkali ] ) .",
    "these features occur for photon energies for which there are now vertical , energy - conserving transitions available . due to the exponential decay of @xmath427 , nonvertical but",
    "energy - conserving transitions are available .",
    "it was shown that interference between surface and bulk emission puts most of the weight of these transitions close to the fermi energy ( shung and mahan 1986 ) .",
    "figure [ figalkali ] illustrates that the theory can almost completely explain the experimental features , with just a few experimental points at larger photon energy unexplained .",
    "thus there seems to be no need to assume a charge - density wave to explain this structure .",
    "the lda systematically underestimates the band gaps in semiconductors and insulators . in table",
    "[ bandgaps ] the calculated lda band gaps of some materials are compared with the experimental gaps .",
    "the discrepancies range from 30 - 100 % and for ge the lda conduction and valence bands in fact overlap when relativistic corrections are included .",
    "also , individual bands away from the fermi level can be in error up to 50 % .",
    "it is natural to ask if the band - gap problem originates from the error in the lda .",
    "exchange - correlation potentials @xmath429 calculated from _ gw _ self - energies turn out to be similar to the lda @xmath430 ( godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) which indicates that even the exact @xmath15 probably does not give the correct gap but this is still an open question .",
    "the @xmath15 may be a non - analytic function of the particle number ( almbladh and von barth 1985b , perdew and levy 1983 , sham and schlter 1983 ) .",
    "that is to say , @xmath15 with an extra electron , @xmath431 , may have an additional constant compared to @xmath432 and this constant may be large .",

    "[ bandgaps ] the band gaps of some materials calculated within the gwa are shown .",
    "the agreement with experiment is very good , in most cases to within 0.1 ev . although it is not strictly true , the self - energy correction is approximately an upward rigid shift of the conduction band relative to the valence band , the so called scissor operator , i.e. cutting the band structure along the band gap and shifting the conduction band rigidly upwards .",
    "the scissor operator is accurate to 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.2 , and 0.4 ev in si , gaas , alas , and diamond respectively ( godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) .",
    "the validity of the scissor operator in si is somewhat fortuitous , due to an almost complete cancellation between the strong energy dependence and non - locality .",
    "the experimental values are obtained from optical measurements or photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments .",
    "the latter corresponds closer to the theoretical values whereas the former may contain excitonic binding energy which should be subtracted off but unfortunately it is unknown . in optical experiments , the excited electron does not leave the system and may therefore form an exciton with the corresponding hole .    to discuss in more details the features in the self - energy which are important for the quasiparticle energies , we consider si as a prototype since it has been studied extensively .",
    "the main features are energy dependence and non - locality .",
    "we first consider non - locality within the cohsex approximation .",
    "a measure of non - locality in the self - energy is its range , the distance @xmath359 beyond which the self - energy is approximately zero .",
    "this range @xmath433 is approximately given by the corresponding value for a jellium with the average density of si ( @xmath434 ) and @xmath435 .",
    "in si more than 99 % of the matrix element of the self - energy in a state @xmath436 , @xmath437 , originates from @xmath438 .",
    "one expects non - locality to be important when @xmath433 is comparable to or greater than the extent or wavelength of the wavefunction which is the case in si .",
    "the matrix element in a non - local potential can be very sensitive to the nodal structure of @xmath436 .",
    "this is contrary to the case when @xmath295 is local such as @xmath15 since it is then @xmath439 that enters into the integral . in si",
    ", non - locality has the effect of widening the gap .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the top of the valence band is bonding p whereas the bottom of the conduction band is antibonding p. therefore non - locality has a larger effect on the conduction band than on the valence band since the antibonding state has an extra node which means a smaller wavelength than that of the bonding state .",
    "the presence of an extra node in the antibonding state reduces the matrix element @xmath437 relative to @xmath440 and therefore the conduction band is pushed upwards .",
    "non - locality has a smaller effect on the valence state so the net effect is a widening of the gap ( godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) .",
    "0.3 cm    the non - locality arises from the density matrix ( exchange charge ) @xmath441 and the screened potential @xmath442 . in semiconductors ,",
    "the screening is not complete because due to the gap , a finite energy is required to excite a particle - hole pair .",
    "the range of the screened interaction and its nodal structure are then determined by @xmath443 .",
    "apart from non - locality , anisotropy also plays an important role . in a homogeneous system , @xmath443 and @xmath82 only depend on @xmath359 . in an inhomogeneous system ,",
    "the screening potential @xmath444 as a function of @xmath211 may strongly depend on the location @xmath200 of the test charge . in si ,",
    "for example , there is a large accumulation of charge in the bonding region as opposed to the antibonding region .",
    "it is to be expected that the screening potential of a test charge located in the bonding and antibonding regions will be very different , as shown in figure [ hl5 ] .",
    "this local field effect , which is entirely missing in the homogeneous case , is very important in covalent materials .",
    "local fields are crucial in determining the strength of the screening hole but not its shape and they contribute directly to the differing strengths of @xmath295 at different points in the unit cell and therefore to the band - gap correction figure [ hl5 ] ( hybertsen and louie 1986 ) . in si local fields account for more than one - third of the screening potential in the region around the bond as can be seen in figure [ hl5 ] .",
    "0.3 cm    the local fields shift the centre of the screening potential and increase it in the bonding region and reduce it in the interstitial .",
    "the local field effect is one important feature in si which distinguishes covalent - bond semiconductors from the alkalis .",
    "the screening potential in these materials is therefore considerably more complex than in the alkalis .",
    "calculations for si show that the local field effect in @xmath82 is confined to a region near @xmath200 as shown in figure [ hl5 ] .",
    "this is not surprising since the long - range part of the potential is contained in the diagonal element @xmath445 corresponding to small @xmath190 . in the plane - wave basis ,",
    "the local fields are described by the off - diagonal elements of the dielectric matrix .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath446 is almost spherical as a function of @xmath211 for a fixed @xmath200 and it is reasonably well reproduced by jellium @xmath295 with the same average density as that of si .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ g7 ] .",
    "however , the interaction of the wavefunction with the non - locality in @xmath295 is not contained within the jellium model .",
    "the local field effect has a large influence on @xmath447 .",
    "in fact , in a homogeneous system @xmath447 is a constant within the cohsex approximation ( equation ( [ sigmacoh ] ) ) .",
    "thus , if local field effect is neglected , @xmath447 has no effects on the band dispersion .",
    "@xmath447 is deeper in the bonding region and shallower in the antibonding region as shown in figure [ hl6 ] .",
    "since the valence state is concentrated in the bonding region and the conduction state in the antibonding region , @xmath447 makes a large contribution to the gap .",
    "@xmath447 is , however , a local potential within the cohsex approximation , a feature which is common to @xmath430 as opposed to @xmath171 which is non - local .",
    "this mechanism of gap opening by @xmath447 could in principle be accounted for by @xmath448 . the local field effect on @xmath171 ,",
    "on the other hand , is small , since the local field effect is rather localized and @xmath171 is dominated by the large bare coulomb interaction for small @xmath449 .",
    "the local field contribution to @xmath171 is about 25 % of that to @xmath450 but of opposite sign ( hybertsen and louie 1986 ) . non - locality is essential in determining the correct quasiparticle energies and in particular the band gap .",
    "0.3 cm    the cohsex approximation is a static approximation to the self - energy . strictly speaking",
    ", the quasiparticle energy should be obtained from the position of the peak in the spectral function .",
    "this procedure requires knowledge of the energy dependence of the self - energy at least around the quasiparticle energy .",
    "the degree of the energy dependence is related to the renormalization factor z ( weight of the quasiparticle , equation ( [ zfactor ] ) ) : the smaller z , the stronger the energy dependence .",
    "the value of z for semiconductors is 0.7 - 0.8 ( hybertsen and louie 1986 ) .",
    "the slope of the real part of the self - energy around the chemical potential is negative and the renormalization factor z reduces the self - energy correction , as shown in equation ( [ qpenergy ] ) .",
    "thus , if the energy dependence of the self - energy is neglected , that is if the self - energy were calculated at the lda instead of quasiparticle energy , the band - gap correction would be overestimated .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the cohsex approximation which approximately corresponds to neglecting the renormalization factor z. a similar conclusion is reached if the self - energy is approximated by its value at @xmath309 . in this case the self - energy correction for the valence state would be underestimated whereas for the conduction state overestimated , leading again to an overestimated band gap .",
    "a much better agreement is obtained if the self - energy correction @xmath451 is simply multiplied by z. we note that the cohsex approximation without local field effect generally gives a gap in better agreement with experiment , although not for si .",
    "this means that local field effect , or in a certain sense non - locality , tends to cancel energy dependence .",
    "the importance of energy dependence is illustrated by plotting @xmath452 and @xmath453 as a function of @xmath454 .",
    "the first quantity is very much like a step function ( scissor operator ) while the second quantity shows a strong energy dependence ( figure 5b and 6b of godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) .",
    "the effect of energy dependence is therefore to alter greatly the dispersion of the individual bands .",
    "in general , the energy dependence of @xmath295 leads to a strongly state - dependent self - energy correction @xmath455 within each band as well as across the gap .",
    "the weak state dependence of @xmath456 for si within a band , resulting in a scissor operator , is therefore a coincidence . in diamond , for instance , the scissor operator approximation is not as good as in si .",
    "0.3 cm    the highest occupied state in the exact dft gives the exact ionization energy ( almbladh and von barth 1985a ) .",
    "assuming that the lda @xmath15 is close to the exact one , we expect the self - energy correction to shift the conduction band but not the top of the valence band .",
    "if the rpa is used to obtain the electron gas data ( von barth - hedin potential 1972 ) , it is indeed found that the the top of the valence band is almost the same within the lda and the gwa ( godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) .",
    "more accurate electron gas data obtained from _",
    "gw _ calculations ( lundqvist and samathiyakanit 1969 ) or quantum monte carlo simulations ( ceperley and alder 1980 ) , however , shift the top of the valence band upward by about 0,5 ev .",
    "thus , vertex corrections ( corrections beyond the gwa ) may shift the _ gw _ bandstructure by 0.5 ev upwards ( godby , schlter , and sham 1988 ) or the lda may not be sufficiently accurate .",
    "other authors have also repeated @xmath0 calculations for si band structure with similar results ( hamada , hwang , and freeman 1990 , rohlfing , krger , and pollman 1993 ) .",
    "calculations of the quasiparticle bandstructure and the band gap of many semiconductors and insulators have been performed by a number of authors .",
    "quasiparticle band structures of six ii - vi compounds zns , znse , znte , cds , cdse , and cdte have been calculated by zakharov _",
    "et al _ ( 1994 ) .",
    "we list in table [ bandgaps ] the results of these calculations .",
    "quasiparticle energies for the f - center defect in licl have also been calculated by surh , chacham , and louie ( 1995 ) and self - energy calculations of carrier - induced band - gap narrowing in si may be found in the work of oschlies , godby , and needs ( 1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "berggren and sernelius ( 1981 ) also studied the band - gap narrowing in doped si and ge as a function of impurity concentration .",
    "application of the gwa to metal - insulator transition of si in the diamond structure ( godby and needs 1989 ) suggests that the metalization occurs at a much smaller volume than in the lda which in turn indicates that the the fermi surface obtained from the kohn - sham dft is not necessarily the same as that of the real system as shown by schnhammer and gunnarsson ( 1988 ) for model systems .",
    "recently , application to a two - dimensional crystal found good agreement between the quasiparticle energies in the gwa and quantum monte carlo results ( engel , kwon , and martin 1995 ) .",

    "the presence of a fermi surface as shown by de haas - van alphen measurements , on the other hand , strongly suggests that the itinerant character of the 3d electrons should be taken into account .",

    "furthermore there is the famous 6 ev satellite below the fermi level ( hfner _ et al _ 1972 , hfner and wertheim 1973 , kemeny and shevchik 1975 ) which is entirely missing in the lda or in any single - particle theory .",
    "these discrepancies are related to excited - state properties .",
    "an indication that single - particle theories would have difficulties in describing quasiparticle properties in ni is the fact that the two lowest atomic configurations @xmath509 and @xmath510 are almost degenerate , differing by only 0.025 ev ( moore 1958 ) .",
    "another indication of many - body effects in ni is the unusually large quasiparticle widths ( eberhardt and plummer 1980 ) - up to 2 ev at the bottom of the 3d band - which implies strong interaction between the quasiparticles and the rest of the system resulting in short life - times .",
    "the photoemission process introduces an additional 3d hole to an already existing one , causing on - site many - body correlations not amenable to a single - particle treatment .",
    "this is in contrast to cu where there is only one 3d hole after photoemission and where the lda bandstructure is good , apart from a somewhat too high position ( 0.4 ev ) of the 3d band relative to the 4s band ( see e.g. jones and gunnarsson 1989 ) .",
    "ground - state properties such as equilibrium lattice constant , bulk modulus , and magnetic moment are well reproduced by the lda with the exception of the cohesive energy where the lda value is about 1 ev too small ( moruzzi , janak , and williams 1978 ) .",
    "the _ gw _ results for ni may be summarized as follows ( aryasetiawan 1992a , aryasetiawan and von barth 1992b ) : the lda bandstructure is much improved , in particular the 3d - band width is narrowed by almost 1 ev , as shown in figure [ a4 ] .",
    "the quasiparticle life - times are also given rather well by the gwa but the exchange splittings remain essentially unchanged from their lda values and the 6 ev satellite is not reproduced .",
    "the self - energies show a number of interesting features . as an illustration , the self - energy as a function of frequency for the @xmath511 state",
    "is shown in figure [ a1 ] .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy is significantly more complicated compared with those of the alkalis or semiconductors .",
    "the latter are typically characterized by a large peak associated with a plasmon excitation but they otherwise show no other distinct structures .",
    "the frequency structure of the imaginary part of the self - energy is determined essentially by the imaginary part of the screened interaction @xmath82 , as may be seen in equation ( [ imsignegw ] ) . in alkalis or @xmath512 semiconductors",
    "i m @xmath82 is dominated by a plasmon peak which is then mirrored in @xmath513 @xmath514 similarly in ni , there is a strong similarity between i m @xmath82 ( figure [ ag3 ] ) and i m @xmath515 . in transition metals , there is no well - defined plasmon excitation , rather it merges with the single - particle excitations forming a broad spectrum .",
    "there is a two - peak structure at about 20 and 30 ev which is probably due to plasmon excitation .",
    "an estimate based on the electron gas formula gives a plasmon energy of 30.8 ev when the 3d electrons are included in the density .",
    "this coincides rather well with the second large peak in the two - peak structure . a smaller structure at around 5 - 6 ev originates from transitions from the occupied valence band to states just above the fermi level which constitute a large density of states .",
    "interesting to observe is the behaviour of i m @xmath516 at large frequencies .",
    "the hole and particle parts show similar behaviour and they therefore tend to cancel each other when one performs a hilbert transform to obtain the real part of the self - energy .",
    "this justifies the use of energy cut - off in the calculation of the response function",
    ". it also agrees with our physical intuition that the main contribution to the self - energy should come from energies up to the plasmon energy . for states lying a few ev below the fermi level , the hole part ( negative energy ) of i",
    "m @xmath515 has larger weight than the particle part ( positive energy ) .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the hole ( occupied ) states have larger overlap and correlation with other occupied states resulting in larger correlated part of the self - energy for the hole part .",
    "as we go towards the fermi level , the hole and particle parts become of almost equal weight .",
    "this is the reason why the self - energy correction for states at the bottom of the band is larger than for those at the top of the band , resulting in band narrowing .",
    "i m @xmath515 around the fermi level shows a quadratic fermi liquid behaviour but it becomes linear rather quickly .",
    "the real part of the self - energy is obtained by hilbert transforming the imaginary part .",
    "a notable feature is a large derivative at around the fermi level which implies large renormalization of the quasiparticle weights .",
    "typical values for the renormalization factor is 0.5 for the 3d states ( aryasetiawan 1992a ) .",
    "this is significantly smaller than in the electron gas ( 0.7 ) ( hedin and lundqvist 1969 ) or semiconductors ( 0.8 ) ( hybertsen and louie 1986 ) which reflects a larger loss of single - particle character of the quasiparticles .",
    "the s states on the other hand have renormalization factor @xmath21 0.7 , comparable to those in the alkalis and semiconductors . it is in agreement with our physical picture that the 3d states are more correlated than the 4s-4p states .    in comparison with semiconductors , the self - energy corrections in ni",
    "is considerably more complicated .",
    "while in semiconductors the self - energy correction is approximately a scissor operator which increases the band gap by shifting the conduction band upwards and leaving the valence band unchanged , the self - energy correction in ni shows a rather strong state and energy dependence",
    ". the self - energy correction can be positive or negative depending on the state and its magnitude varies throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "for example , at the @xmath517-point the bottom of the 3d band experiences a self - energy correction of 0.8 ev while the top of the band is almost unchanged .",
    "the correction to the state @xmath518 is positive whereas at @xmath519 state it is negative .",
    "the state dependence of the self - energy correction is demonstrated clearly in figure [ a4 ] by the lowest valence band which is of 4s character at the bottom and a mixture between s and d at the top .",
    "the self - energy correction is approximately zero at the bottom of the band and positive at the band edges .",
    "the free - electron - like s states are well described by the lda but the description of the more localized d states is less satisfactory .    as can be seen in figure [ a4 ] ,",
    "the 3d band width is reduced by almost 1 ev . the exchange splittings on the other hand remain essentially unchanged from their lda values . the discrepancy between the lda exchange splitting and the experiment is rather small , 0.3 ev , which is slightly larger than the numerical accuracy ( 0.1 - 0.2 ev ) but the results seem to indicate inadequacy in the gwa itself . _",
    "gw _ calculations on transition metal atoms also show that strong correlations among 3d electrons of opposite spin are not well accounted for by the gwa ( shirley and martin 1993 ) .",
    "the quasiparticle widths or the inverse life - times are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data ( aryasetiawan 1992a ) .",
    "the large width at the bottom of the 3d band indicates a strong interaction between the quasiparticles and the rest of the system .",
    "0.3 cm    as mentioned before , the 6 ev satellite is not reproduced in the gwa .",
    "that the 6 ev satellite is missing in the gwa can be seen directly in the imaginary part of the self - energy . for the existence of a satellite",
    ", there should be a strong peak at around 5 - 6 ev reflecting the presence of a stable excitation . but as can be seen in figure [ a1 ] , such peak is missing .",
    "3p - resonance photoemission measurements at 67 ev photon energy corresponding to the binding energy of the 3p core exhibit an asymmetric ( fano ) resonant enhancement of the satellite and the main 3d line shows a strong antiresonance ( guillot _ et al _ 1977 ) .",
    "this is explained as an auger process where a 3p core electron is excited to fill the empty 3d states followed by a super coster - kronig decay @xmath520 although there is some indication that the 6 ev structure might arise from single - particle states ( kanski , nilsson , and larsson 1980 ) the 3p resonance photoemission provides a strong evidence of the many - body character of the 6 ev satellite .",
    "the standard explanation for the presence of the satellite ( penn 1979 , liebsch 1979 , 1981 ) is that a 3d hole created in a photoemission experiment introduces a strong perturbation due to its localized nature , causing another 3d electron to be excited to an empty state just above the fermi level . in atomic picture , the state with two 3d holes correspond to the configuration @xmath521 which is separated from the main line configuration @xmath522 by more than 6 ev but which is reduced considerably by metallic screening .",
    "the two holes scatter each other repeatedly forming a  bound state  at 6 ev . in a simple picture ,",
    "the photon energy is used to emit a d electron and to excite another into an empty d state so that the emitted electron appears to have a lower binding energy ( satellite ) .",
    "the excited electrons mainly come from the bottom of the d band since they have the largest mixing with the s - p states and therefore , according to the dipole selection rule , a large transition to the empty d states .",
    "this then has been argued as the source of band narrowing .",
    "the _ gw _ calculations , however , show that the largest contribution to band narrowing comes mainly from screening rather than two - hole interactions .",
    "0.3 cm    the reduction in the exchange splittings is related to the satellite .",
    "for simplicity we consider a two - level model with fully occupied majority channel and one occupied minority channel .",
    "a photoemission hole in the majority channel can induce another hole in the minority channel but not vice versa since the majority channel has no empty states .",
    "thus , the effects of two - hole interactions are larger for the majority than for the minority channel resulting in a reduction in the exchange splitting .",
    "calculations based on the hubbard model within the t - matrix approach ( kanamori 1963 ) confirm this picture ( liebsch 1979 , 1981 , penn 1979 ) .",
    "these model calculations also assign the reduction in the band width as originating from the two - hole interactions which is not in complete agreement with the _ gw _ calculations .",
    "these results may be reconciled as follows . in the t - matrix calculations , it was found that there was no value of u that gave the correct satellite position and the band width . to get the correct band width ,",
    "the value of u was such that the satellite energy became too large ( liebsch 1981 ) .",
    "if we assume that the t - matrix theory gives the correct physical description for the satellite , the appropriate value of u would not give a large reduction in the band width , but this is taken care of by the gwa .",
    "thus one concludes that self - energy calculations which include the diagrams of the gwa and t - matrix theory may give both the correct band width and the satellite structure .",
    "diagrammatic comparison between the gwa and the t - matrix theory reveals that hole - hole interactions described by the t - matrix are not included in the gwa except to second order only .",
    "direct comparison between _ gw _ calculations on real systems and hubbard model calculations is , however , difficult if not impossible .",
    "this is because the hubbard u can not be easily related to the screened interaction in the_gw _ calculations .",
    "an extension of the t - matrix theory including fadeev s three - body interaction ( fadeev 1963 ) was made by igarashi ( 1983 , 1985 ) and by calandra and manghi ( 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the theory has been applied to ni ( igarashi _ et al _ 1994 , manghi , bellini , and arcangeli 1997 ) and nio ( manghi and calandra 1994 ) .",
    "nio is a prototype of the mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "it was pointed out by mott in the late forties that a system with an on - site coulomb energy larger than the single - particle bandwidth tends to become an insulator and that single - particle theory is bound to give a wrong prediction for the state of the system ( mott 1949 ) .",
    "indeed , the lda predicts nio to be a metal when the calculation is performed in a paramagnetic state ( mattheiss 1972a , b ) .",
    "slater ( 1974 ) suggested that a gap could be opened by an interplay between antiferromagnetism and crystal - field splittings . a detailed work along this direction can be found in a paper by terakura _",
    "et al _ ( terakura _ et al _ 1984 ) .",
    "the lda does produce a gap in an antiferromagnetic state but of only 0.2 ev in contrast to the experimental gap of 4.0 ev ( powell and spicer 1970 , hfner _",
    "et al _ 1984 , sawatzky and allen 1984 ) .",
    "as expected , the free - electron like o p band is well described by the lda but the magnetic moment is too small ( 1.0 @xmath523 ) compared to experiment ( 1.7 - 1.9 @xmath523 ) ( alperin 1962 , fender _",
    "et al _ 1968 , cheetham and hope 1983 ) .",
    "clearly there is something seriously wrong with the lda . a more convincing evidence is provided by coo , where the number of electrons in the paramagnetic structure is odd , making it impossible for any single - particle theory to predict coo as an insulator without doubling the unit cell .",
    "experimentally , coo is an antiferromagnetic insulator so that one might argue like slater that single - particle theory could still give the correct prediction if the calculation is performed in an antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "one realizes , however , that the difference in magnetic energy distinguishing the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states is only a fraction of an ev , which is much smaller than the band gap .",
    "this means that the result of a theoretical calculation for the band gap should not depend on whether the calculation is performed in a paramagnetic or an antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "the basic physics of the mott - hubbard insulators was explained by mott several decades ago ( mott 1949 ) . from the tight - binding limit ,",
    "switching on hopping matrix elements causes the formation of a band of width @xmath524 centred around the atomic eigenvalue .",
    "the possibility of occupying states with lower energy favours electron hopping but it costs a coulomb energy @xmath4 for an electron to hop from one site to the neighbouring site .",
    "if @xmath4 is larger than @xmath525 the gain in kinetic energy is overwhelmed by the loss in coulomb energy and the system prefers to be an insulator with a gap approximately given by @xmath526 splitting the lower and upper hubbard bands . while the mott picture is essentially correct ,",
    "there are a number of experimental data which can not be explained .",
    "the value of @xmath526 for instance , is estimated to be 8 - 10 ev which is much larger than the experimental gap .",
    "more recent studies initiated by fujimori , minami , and sugano ( fujimori _ et al _ 1984 ) and sawatzky and allen ( sawatzky and allen 1984 ) based on the cluster approach and anderson impurity model show that the gap in nio is a charge - transfer gap .",
    "if an electron is removed from a ni site the number of holes increases leading to a state with high energy due to an increase in the coulomb interaction among the holes . the hole created on the ni site",
    "may be filled by the transfer of an electron from an o site .",
    "although it costs some energy transfer this leads to a state with a small binding energy .",
    "the states at the top of the valence band therefore have a large o p character .",
    "the lowest conduction state is of d character as in the mott picture and the gap is therefore formed between the valence o p and conduction ni d states .",
    "much of the ni d weight goes into a satellite located below the o p , opposite to the mott and the slater pictures .",
    "this model is able to explain experimental data which would otherwise be difficult to explain by the mott and slater pictures .",
    "the most convincing evidence supporting the charge - transfer picture is the 2p resonant photoemission experiment in cuo ( tjeng _ et al _ 1991 ) which has a similar electronic structure as that of nio . in this experiment ,",
    "a 2p core electron is excited and the remaining hole is subsequently filled by a valence electron . since dipole transition matrix element is largest between p and d states , resonance in the valence energy region can be identified as the position of d states which turns out to be below the o p band , rather than above as in the mott and slater pictures .    0.3 cm    the lda antiferromagnetic bandstructure is shown in figure [ ag1 ] .",
    "the highest valence state is formed by the majority @xmath527 and minority @xmath528 ni states and the lowest conduction band is formed by the minority @xmath527 state . _",
    "gw _ calculation for nio gives a gap of @xmath215.5 ev ( aryasetiawan and gunnarsson 1995 ) .",
    "starting from the lda antiferromagnetic bandstructure with a gap of 0.2 ev , a _",
    "calculation shifts the ni @xmath527 conduction upwards , increasing the gap to @xmath211 ev .",
    "this upward shift of the @xmath527 conduction band leads to a substantial change of the character of the wavefunctions , reducing the amount of minority @xmath527 character in the occupied states . to include a limited self - consistency",
    ", we introduce a new non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath529 with a non - local potential @xmath530 where @xmath385 is chosen so that the band gap obtained from @xmath529 agrees with the gap obtained from the previous _ gw _ calculation .",
    "this @xmath529 is then used to generate a new @xmath273 and a new self - energy in the gwa .",
    "this procedure is iterated to self - consistency .",
    "the non - local potential modifies the eigenvalues as well as the wave functions used to construct the zeroth order green function @xmath273 .",
    "the raising of the unoccupied majority @xmath527 band by the self - energy correction reduces the hybridization with the o p band and has the effects of raising the bottom of the o p band and pushing down the top of the o p band at the @xmath357 -point resulting in better agreement with photoemission data .",
    "in addition , the width of the unoccupied @xmath531 band is reduced .",
    "the reduction in hybridization also reduces the magnitude of the exchange interaction of the @xmath527 band with the occupied states which has the consequence of widening the gap .",
    "thus , it is important that the wave functions are also modified in the self - consistent procedure .",
    "the final position of the unoccupied @xmath527 band is just below the ni 4s . as a check",
    ", the calculation has also been performed in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "a gap of @xmath21 5.2 ev was obtained , close to the antiferromagnetic value .",
    "in contrast to the slater model , the gap does not depend on the antiferromagnetic ordering and the results correctly predict that nio remains an insulator above the nel temperature .",
    "the _ gw _ calculation clearly improves the lda gap markedly and it is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 4.0 ev .",
    "an estimate of the magnetic moment yields a value of 1.6 @xmath532 ( aryasetiawan and gunnarsson 1995 ) in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.7 - 1.9 @xmath532 .",
    "0.3 cm    to study the character of the states at the top of the valence band , the spectral function has been calculated .",
    "projection of the spectrum into the ni 3d and o p orbitals shows that there is an increase of the o p character at the top of the valence band but the main character is primarily ni 3d .",
    "the satellite at -8 ev ( shen _ et al _ 1990 , shen _",
    "et al _ 1991a , shen _",
    "et al _ 1991b ) is not reproduced at the final self - consistent spectrum but a more detailed study of the satellite structure reveals that it is rather sensitive to the starting hamiltonian ( aryasetiawan and karlsson 1996 ) .",
    "starting from the lda hamiltonian in fact gives a satellite at about -10 ev but this satellite diminishes in intensity as the gap opens up .",
    "the origin of this behaviour can be traced back to the presence of a plasmon - like peak at low energy which is related to the incorrect lda bandstructure . as the gap opens up , this peak structure becomes broadened and consequently the satellite structure diminishes . as in the case of ni , it appears that the satellite structure is due to short - ranged correlations which are not properly taken into account by the rpa .",
    "t - matrix approach could be appropriate and might remove some ni d weight from the top of the valence band to the satellite region but it is not clear how this could increase the charge transfer from the o p.      a calculation on mno based on a simplified _ gw _ scheme described in section 4 has been performed by massidda _",

    "the magnetic moment is also somewhat too small ( lda 4.3 @xmath523 , experiment 4.6 - 4.8 @xmath523 ) although the relative discrepancy is not as large as in nio .",
    "the larger lda band gap is due to the fact that in mno the majority spin is fully occupied and the minority spin is empty resulting in a large magnetic moment so that the exchange splitting is also large and dominates the ligand - field splitting and band broadening due to intersublattice coupling . in nio",
    "the magnetic moment is smaller and the exchange splitting is comparable to the ligand - field splitting and band broadening .    the semiempirical model _",
    "_ calculation gives a gap of 4.2 ev which compares well with the experimental value of 3.8 - 4.2 ev .",
    "the lda magnetic moment is also improved to 4.52 @xmath523 .",
    "there is an increase of o p character and a decrease of ni 3d character at the top of the valence band , which are percentagewise large but small in absolute term , so that the main character is still primarily ni 3d .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to the full _ gw _ calculations on nio described above .",
    "calculation on cacuo@xmath24 using the model @xmath0 scheme was also done recently ( massidda _ et al _ 1997 ) .",
    "it is well - known that the lda eigenvalues for localized states are usually too high compared to experiment .",
    "the discrepancies can be several ev .",
    "for example , the zn semicore 3d states in znse are too high by 2.5 ev , the ga semicore 3d states in gaas by 4 ev and the ge 3d semicore states by as much as 5 ev .",
    "in free atoms these deviations are even larger and in , for instance , a free zn atom the 3d eigenvalue is about 6.5 ev too high .",
    "this raises interesting questions about whether or not gwa can describe these shallow core levels and why the lda eigenvalues are substantially worse for free atoms than for solids , although the semicore states are almost completely localized .    for _ deep _ core levels , an important contribution to the gwa self - energy comes from the polarization ( relaxation ) of the more weakly bound electrons ( hedin and lundqvist 1969 , lundqvist 1969 ) .",
    "this relaxation is a classical electrostatic effect , which can be described in @xmath533scf calculations , performing ground - state calculations with and without the core hole .",
    "explicit @xmath533scf calculations for free atoms were performed by hedin and johansson ( 1969 ) , who obtained quite accurate results .",
    "this suggests that gwa may be rather accurate for such deep core levels , since it includes similar physics as the @xmath533scf calculations .    0.3 cm    it is not a priori clear that gwa can describe semicore states . unlike the deep core states , the _ shallow _ core states are screened by states which are almost degenerate with the hole , which may introduce new effects .",
    "calculations for semicore states in znse , gaas and ge ( aryasetiawan and gunnarsson 1996 ) showed , however , that gwa improves the lda eigenvalues significantly also for these core states , leaving a discrepancy of only 0.5 - 1.0 ev to experiment ( too small binding energy ) .",
    "the errors in the lda eigenvalues are to a large extent due the unphysical interaction of an electron with itself .",
    "this interaction is only incompletely cancelled by the exchange correlation potential ( gunnarsson , lundqvist , and wilkins 1974 ) .",
    "this leads to an ionization energy which is too small .",
    "in addition relaxation effects are neglected , which tends to overestimate the ionization energy and therefore partly cancels the error from the self - interaction . as discussed above , essential relaxation effects",
    "are included in @xmath533scf calculations .",
    "in addition , the lda total energies are rather accurate and the self - interaction errors are rather small .",
    "this is due to an exact sum - rule satisfied by the lda ( gunnarsson and lundqvist , 1976 ) .",
    "while this sum - rule is very important for total energy calculations , it does not necessarily imply a good exchange - correlation potential or accurate eigenvalues .",
    "it is therefore crucial that @xmath533scf calculations involve total energy differences rather than eigenvalues .    to understand the different accuracy of the lda eigenvalues for a solid and a free atom , aryasetiawan and gunnarsson ( 1996 ) performed transition state calculations in the slater transition state approach ( slater 1974 ) .",
    "these calculations showed that in the solid the creation of a core hole leads to a substantial charge transfer to the site where the hole was created ( lang and williams 1977 , zunger and lindefelt 1983 ) . due to this charge",
    "transfer the relaxation energy is larger than for a free atom .",
    "the cancellation of the error in the eigenvalues due to the self - interaction and the error due to the neglect of relaxation effects therefore becomes more complete in the solid than in a free atom .",
    "this explains why the errors in the eigenvalues are much smaller in the solid ( aryasetiawan and gunnarsson 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath533scf gave ionization energies for the 3d semicore states which were about 1 ev too large .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath533scf and gwa may be due to an error in the lda , which tends to overestimate the exchange - correlation energy between a 3d electron and the 3s-3p core ( gunnarsson and jones 1980 ) which is about 1 ev in the series k - cu ( harris and jones 1978 ) .",
    "it could also be due to the difference in the rpa screening and the static lda screening .",
    "transition state calculations for a number of zn compounds have also been performed by zhang , wei , and zunger ( 1995 ) .",
    "we observe , however , that the slater transition state approach requires that the semicore states are sufficiently localized to form a bound state in the transition state calculations .",
    "the bound state has no dispersion , in contrast to the _ gw _ results which show the full band structure .",
    "thus , if a bound state is not formed in the transition state calculation , the result would be identical to that of the lda .",
    "the problem can be illustrated for cu metal where the 3d band is 0.5 ev too high .",
    "the transition state would give a single number rather than a band assuming that a bound state is formed in the first place .",
    "calculation on the other hand lowers the position of the band by 0.2 - 0.3 ev while maintaining the lda band structure ( aryasetiawan and gunnarsson 1997 ) .",
    "a model _ gw _ calculation for zno by massidda _",
    "( 1995b ) also improved the lda result from -5.4 ev to -6.4 ev but a significant error remains when compared to experimental results -8.6 ev and -7.5 ev .",
    "_ gw _ calculations for a model jellium - vacuum interface have been done in some details .",

    ", the image potential is known to decay exponentially ( lang and kohn 1973 ) .",
    "this unphysical behaviour is due to the fact that in the lda the exchange - correlation hole is determined by the local density and it does not feel the surface directly . the exchange - correlation hole obeys a sum - rule that it must integrate to one but since the density is small outside the surface it means that the hole becomes very extended .",
    "in fact about half the hole resides far inside the surface . due to the very extended structure of the hole ,",
    "the resulting @xmath15 decays exponentially outside the surface .",
    "the situation is similar to the atomic case where the lda @xmath430 decays exponentially instead of decaying as @xmath535 as in the exact @xmath536 ( almbladh and von barth 1985a ) .",
    "similarly , the exact dft exchange - correlation potential should be capable of reproducing the correct behaviour of the image potential which is important in many applications .",
    "for example , the lda potential can not produce the rydberg series of image states .",
    "binding energies and life - time of surface states bound by image potential depend crucially on the @xmath537 dependence as do tunneling currents in the scanning - tunneling microscope and positions of alkali ions adsorbed on metal substrates .",
    "interpretation of inverse photoemission data relies on the existence of the image tail of the surface barrier .    by calculating the self - energy for the surface ,",
    "a @xmath15 can be derived simply by taking the trace of the following dyson equation ( sham and schlter 1983,1985 , van leeuwen 1996 ) @xmath538 and noting that the exact density is equal to the exact df density ( i.e. the trace of @xmath69 is equal to the trace of @xmath539 .",
    "this yields @xmath540 the exchange - correlation potential obtained from the above equation using the _ gw _ self - energy exhibits the correct asymptotic behaviour as can be seen in figure [ e1 ] .",

    "this process is continued until @xmath69 obtained from the dyson equation is the same as @xmath69 used to calculate the self - energy .",
    "self - consistency is evidently an important issue since it guarantees that the final results are independent of the starting green function .",
    "moreover , according to the baym - kadanoff theory ( 1961 ) , a self - consistent @xmath0 scheme ensures conservation of particle number and energy when the system is subjected to an external perturbation .",

    "moreover , self - consistency ensures that @xmath588 gives the correct total number of particles . when @xmath10 and @xmath589 is obtained from the self - consistent green function .",
    "the first self - consistent @xmath0 calculation was probably by de groot , bobbert , and van haeringen ( 1995 ) for a model quasi - one dimensional semiconducting wire .",
    "the relevance of this model to real solids is , however , unclear .",
    "five aspects may be distinguished in relation to self - consistency ( von barth and holm 1996 ) :    1 .",
    "modification of quasiparticle wavefunctions .",
    "2 .   shift of quasiparticle energies .",
    "3 .   modification of quasiparticle weights ( z factors ) .",
    "4 .   modification of quasiparticle life - times .",
    "modification of the screening properties of the system .",
    "these aspects were recently studied in detail by von barth and holm ( 1996 ) and by shirley ( 1996 ) for the electron gas .",
    "naturally , the first aspect can not be addressed for the electron gas since the quasiparticle wavefunctions remain plane waves .",
    "the results of these studies are    * the band width is increased from its non - self - consistent value , worsening the agreement with experiment . *",
    "the weight of the quasiparticles is increased , reducing the weight in the plasmon satellite . * the quasiparticles are narrowed , increasing their life - time . *",
    "the plasmon satellite is broadened and shifted towards the fermi level .",
    "in fact , it almost disappears at full self - consistency .",
    "0.3 cm    as discussed below , the main effects of self - consistency are caused by allowing the quasiparticle weight to vary ( von barth and holm 1996 ) .",
    "these results are true for the case when the screened interaction @xmath82 is fixed at the rpa level ( calculated using the non - interacting @xmath92 ) and only the green function is allowed to vary to self - consistency and also for the case when both @xmath69 and @xmath82 are allowed to vary ( full self - consistency case ) .",
    "the increase in the band width is disturbing and can be understood as follows .",
    "let us consider the first case with fixed @xmath590 for simplicity .",
    "first we note that the @xmath0 result for the band width after one iteration is close to the free electron one .",
    "this means that there is almost a complete cancellation between exchange and correlation .",
    "after one iteration the quasiparticle weight is reduced to typically 0.7 and the rest of the weight goes to the plasmon satellite .",
    "correspondingly , when the new @xmath69 is used to calculate a new i m @xmath591 its weight is transferred away from low energy to high energy , due to the sum rule ( von barth and holm 1996 ) @xmath592 which shows that the left - hand - side is a constant depending only on the prechosen @xmath593 but independent of @xmath39 and self - consistency . for a state at the fermi level , this has little effect since @xmath594 has almost equal weights for the hole @xmath595 and the particle part @xmath596 which cancel each other when calculating @xmath597 as can be seen in equation ( [ realsig ] ) .",
    "but for the state at the bottom of the valence band , @xmath594 has most of its weight in the hole part so that the shifting of the weight in @xmath594 to higher energy causes @xmath598 to be less positive than its non - self - consistent value .",
    "a similar effect is found for the exchange part which becomes less negative but because the bare coulomb interaction has no frequency dependence , the renormalization factor has a smaller effect on @xmath599 so that the reduction in @xmath599 is less than the reduction in @xmath170 .",
    "the net effect is then an increase in the band width .",
    "the shifting of the weight in @xmath600 to higher energy has immediate consequences of increasing the life - time and the renormalization weight z ( through a decrease in @xmath601 of the quasiparticles and of broadening the plasmon satellite , compared to the results of one iteration ( von barth and holm 1996 ) .",
    "when @xmath82 is allowed to vary ( full self - consistency ) the results become even worse : the band width becomes even wider and the plasmon satellite becomes broad and featureless , in contradiction to experiment .",
    "the quasiparticle weight is increased further .",
    "these results can be explained by the disappearance of a well - defined plasmon excitation in @xmath236 the quantity @xmath602 no longer has a physical meaning of a response function , rather it is an auxiliary quantity needed to construct @xmath236 indeed , it does not satisfy the usual @xmath603 sum rule .",
    "the equations @xmath604 determining the plasmon energy are not satisfied any more since the green function now always has weight around @xmath605 this has the effect of transferring even more weight in @xmath594 to higher energy with the consequences discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "shirley ( 1996 ) included the second order self - energy diagram ( vertex correction ) and found that it cancelled the effects of self - consistency to some degree .",
    "0.3 cm    a very interesting outcome of the full self - consistent calculation ( holm and von barth 1997 ) is that the total energy calculated with the galitskii - migdal formula ( 1958 ) turns out to be strikingly close to the total energy calculated from a much more elaborate quantum monte carlo technique ( ceperley and alder 1980 ) . for",
    "@xmath606 2 and 4 quantum monte - carlo gives 0.004 and -0.155 rydberg respectively while the self - consistent @xmath0 gives 0.005 and -0.156 rydberg .",
    "this unexpected result may be related to the fact that the self - consistent @xmath0 scheme is energy conserving and it is partly explained by consideration of the luttinger - ward energy functional ( 1960 ) which is variational with respect to @xmath69 and its minimum is equal to the value obtained from the galitskii - migdal formula .",
    "what is not clear is why the first order energy diagram ( giving the @xmath0 self - energy upon taking functional derivative with respect to @xmath607 appears to represent a very good energy functional .",
    "furthermore , the chemical potential calculated from @xmath608 is in agreement with the value obtained from @xmath609 and the particle density @xmath610 yields @xmath611 , i.e. particle number is conserved , as proven by baym ( 1962 ) .",
    "it has also been proven that with a fixed @xmath590 particle number is also conserved ( holm and von barth 1997 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that it is not a good idea to perform fully self - consistent @xmath0 calculations for quasiparticle energies .",
    "if full self - consistency is not introduced , an important question is how to choose @xmath145 determining @xmath92 .",
    "farid ( 1997 ) argued that @xmath145 should be chosen so that its ground - state density is the same as the one resulting from the @xmath0 calculation",
    ". it could be more favourable to perform partially self - consistent calculations by , for instance , fixing @xmath82 at the rpa level and modifying the quasiparticle energies in @xmath92 , or by choosing a single - particle hamiltonian such that the resulting quasiparticle energies obtained from a @xmath0 calculation are the same as the those of the single - particle hamiltonian . in any case",
    ", efforts should be directed towards finding vertex corrections ( beyond @xmath0 ) .",
    "by vertex corrections we mean corrections to the self - energy beyond the @xmath0-rpa approximation and corrections to the response function beyond the rpa .",
    "vertex corrections to the rpa response function naturally involve interaction between screening electrons not taken into account in the rpa . this interaction must include the effect of exchange and correlation , which makes the interaction depend upon the relative spin states of the electrons .",
    "vertex corrections to the self - energy on the other hand involve interaction of the hole with its surroundings not taken into account in the gwa . a consistent treatment should include vertex corrections in both the response function and the self - energy ( ward 1950 ) .",
    "this preserves conservation laws and is a natural outcome of the perturbation expansion of the self - energy in the functional derivative technique of baym and kadanoff ( 1961 ) and baym ( 1962 ) .",
    "for example , calculations of the optical spectra of si indicate a cancellation between vertex corrections in the response function and the renormalization of the quasiparticle energies ( bechstedt _ et al _ 1997 , del sole and girlanda 1996 ) .",
    "mahan and sernelius ( 1989 ) found a similar effect in the calculations of band widths of the electron gas . conserving approximations including vertex corrections with exchange effects",
    "only have been considered by hong and mahan ( 1994 ) for the electron gas .    in the gwa ,",
    "the screened interaction is calculated within the rpa which takes into account primarily long - range correlation which gives rise to collective excitations ( plasmons ) .",
    "the photoemission hole is coupled to one plasmon only in the gwa .",
    "vertex corrections may be loosely divided into the short - range and long - range parts .",
    "short - range vertex corrections improve the description of the quasiparticles and low - energy satellites whereas long - range vertex corrections improve description of high - energy satellites ( plasmons ) .    the rpa pair distribution function , which is the probability of finding another electron at a certain distance from a given electron , is negative for small distances , which is unphysical ( pines 1961 ) .",
    "exchange and correlations should therefore increase the probability of finding another electron at small distances .",
    "the same applies to holes . for a test charge ,",
    "the screening becomes more effective when the effects of exchange and correlations are taken into account .",
    "but for an electron , the rpa screening is _ reduced _ when the effects of exchange and correlations between the screened electron and the surrounding electrons are taken into account .",
    "the physical interpretation of vertex corrections is as follows : an electron pushes away other electrons in its vicinity creating a screening hole around the electron .",
    "taking into account exchange and correlations of the screening holes increases the screening since the probability of the holes getting closer together is increased leading to more screening holes .",
    "if we now take into account the effects of exchange and correlations between the screened electron and the other electrons , then screening will be reduced because the probability of finding electrons at small distances to the screened electron is increased , leading to stronger effective interactions between the electrons .",
    "the net effect is that the rpa screening is reduced .",
    "thus , vertex corrections for electrons will in general reduce screening .",
    "vertex corrections in the response function can also take the form of interaction between electrons and holes in electron - hole pairs created by the perturbation in the system due to the presence of a photoemission hole .",
    "this interaction may actually create an additional bound state ( exciton ) much lower in energy , of the order of a few ev , than the plasmon energy .",
    "vertex corrections to the self - energy are particularly important for systems with localized states , such as those containing 3d and 4f orbitals .",
    "this is because the electron - hole pairs created in the screening process can be rather localized and therefore interact strongly with the localized photoemission hole .",
    "this interaction can significantly modify the quasihole energy and its weight as well as creating new collective excitations appearing as low energy satellites .",
    "this type of vertex corrections is short range in nature .",
    "long - range vertex corrections modify the structure of the plasmon satellites and may create multiple plasmons as observed in the alkalis . in the gwa , the photoemission hole only couples to one plasmon , resulting in one - plasmon satellite .",
    "the hole , however , can in general interact with several plasmons during its propagation , producing multiple plasmon satellites .",
    "formally , the gwa is the first - order term in the expansion of the self - energy in the screened interaction _ w_.",
    "it is then thought that the simplest vertex correction is the second - order self - energy .",
    "this procedure , however , warrants some precautions .",
    "first , the physical meaning of the second - order term is not clear .",
    "second , this second - order term when evaluated with a frequency - dependent interaction can give a self - energy with wrong analytic properties which result in a negative density of states , as shown in the electron - gas case ( minnhagen 1974 ) .",
    "this type of vertex correction was calculated for the band gap of si both with a bare and a screened interaction ( daling and van haeringen 1989 , daling _ et al _ 1991 , bobbert and van haeringen 1994 ) . the second - order self - energy with the bare coulomb interaction",
    "was found to be factors 18 and 37 smaller than the first - order self - energy for @xmath612 and @xmath613 states , which correspond to a correction of @xmath3271 % with respect to the hartree - fock direct gap .",
    "a calculation using a screened interaction yields a correction to the gap of the order of @xmath3274 % .",
    "since this calculation was performed for the gap states only , it is not clear if the density of states became negative for some energies .",
    "both calculation indicate in any case that the second - order term is small .",
    "this is encouraging since it suggests that higher - order terms are probably small too since the gwa already gives results in agreement with experiment .",
    "an interesting result is that the second - order vertex correction does not shift the absolute position of the lda valence - band maximum which in the approximation used is too low by 0.5 ev .",
    "it is speculated that higher order vertex corrections could account for the required shift ( bobbert and van haeringen 1994 ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ hedin1],[hedin2],[hedin3],[hedin4 ] ) derived by hedin provides a systematic way of developing a perturbation series for the self - energy in powers of the screened interaction _",
    "w_. in the original derivation , the zeroth - order green function is taken to be the hartree one .",
    "however , the band structure and wavefunctions in the hartree theory are less accurate compared with those of the lda , making hartree green function a poor starting point . in practical calculations ,",
    "one uses a green function constructed from the lda band structure .",
    "the response function is also calculated using the lda green function .",
    "consistent vertex corrections were derived by rice ( 1965 ) in relation to the dielectric function as discussed in the alkali section .",
    "a similar approach was also made ting , lee , and quinn ( 1975 ) and mahan ( 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , consistent vertex corrections can also be derived from the the set of equations ( [ hedin1 ] , [ hedin2 ] , [ hedin3 ] , [ hedin4 ] ) where one regards @xmath614 as a self - energy correction to the hartree approximation , albeit an _ ad hoc _",

    "the product @xmath620 is equal to @xmath621 with @xmath622 given above .",
    "this dielectric function may also be derived straightforwardly from time - dependent lda and may therefore be interpreted as the dielectric function that screens the external potential felt by an electron , as opposed to a test charge ( hybertsen and louie 1986 ) .",
    "this distinguishes itself from the rpa ( time - dependent hartree ) dielectric function in that the induced charge does not only generate the hartree potential but also an exchange - correlation potential .",
    "it is clear that one could start with a different local zeroth - order self - energy other than @xmath614 and arrive at a similar formula .",
    "note that in the formula for the self - energy in equation ( [ hedin1 ] ) , the vertex function @xmath623 enters both _",
    "( through _ p _ ) and @xmath19 .",

    "application of such scheme to the electron gas gives small changes compared with the original gwa ( mahan and sernelius 1989 ) .",
    "similarly , for si it yields practically the same gap ( 0.70 ev ) and valence band width ( 11.4 ev ) as those of the standard _ gw _ calculation ( del sole , reining , and godby 1994 ) . however , the absolute position of the top of the valence band is shifted 10 mev upwards by the _ gw_+vertex corrections and 400 mev downwards by the standard _",

    "@xmath635 is the shift in core energy due to the interaction with the plasmon field .",
    "it is assumed that the plasmon excitations have no dispersion although this assumption is not necessary .",
    "the spectra consist therefore of the main quasiparticle peak at @xmath636 and a series of plasmon excitations at multiples of the plasmon energy below the quasiparticle peak which is in accordance with experiment .",
    "this is in contrast to the _ gw _ spectra which only has one plasmon excitation located at too high energy , typically 1.5 @xmath637 below the quasiparticle peak ( hedin , lundqvist , and lundqvist 1970 ) . more recently the cumulant expansion method was applied to a model hamiltonian with electron - boson interaction and the cumulant was calculated to higher order ( gunnarsson , meden , and schnhammer 1994 ) .    in the cumulant expansion approach",

    "the total spectra can be written as a sum of @xmath666 and a convolution between the quasiparticle and the satellite part : @xmath667 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a_{qp}\\left ( k,\\omega \\right ) + a_{qp}\\left ( k,\\omega \\right ) * a_s\\left ( k,\\omega \\right )   \\label{convolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath668 ^2+\\ldots \\right\\ } \\label{cumulants}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term @xmath669 is responsible for the satellite structure .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath670 can be done analytically ( aryasetiawan , hedin , and karlsson 1996 ) @xmath671    as follows from equations ( [ aqp ] ) and ( [ convolution ] ) , the quasiparticle energy in the cumulant expansion is essentially determined by @xmath672 which is the quasiparticle energy in the gwa .",
    "= 3.in    = 3.in    0.3 cm    by comparing the diagrammatic expansions in the gwa and the cumulant expansion we can get some idea about the vertex corrections . in figure [",
    "fig : diag ] the green function diagrams are shown to second order in the screened interaction , which should be sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the cumulant expansion diagrams are obtained by considering the three possible time - orderings of the integration time variables @xmath673 in @xmath674 with @xmath641 given by equation ( [ cumulant ] ) .",
    "the cumulant expansion contains second - order diagrams which are not included in the gwa .",
    "it is these additional diagrams that give rise to the second plasmon satellite and they are quite distinct from the second - order diagram common to both approximations .",
    "the interpretation of the latter diagram is that a hole emits a plasmon which is reabsorbed at a later time and the hole returns to its original state before plasmon emission .",
    "this process is repeated once at a later time .",
    "thus there is only one plasmon coupled to the hole at one time .",
    "in contrast , the other two diagrams , not contained in the gwa , describe an additional plasmon emission before the first one is reabsorbed , giving two plasmons coupled to the hole simultaneously .",
    "similar consideration can be extended to the higher - order diagrams . if self - consistency is taken into account then the second second - order diagram is also included in the gwa .",
    "the cumulant expansion contains only boson - type diagrams describing emission and reabsorbtion of plasmons but it does not contain diagrams corresponding to interaction between a hole and particle - hole pairs . for this reason , the cumulant expansion primarily corrects the satellite description whereas the quasiparticle energies are to a large extent determined by the gwa as mentioned before . interaction between hole - hole and particle - hole",
    "is described by the ladder diagrams which in a hubbard model study were found to improve the low - energy satellite ( verdozzi , godby , and holloway 1995 ) .",
    "the cumulant expansion was applied recently to calculate the photoemission spectra in na and al ( aryasetiawan , hedin , and karlsson 1996 ) . the experimental spectra consist of a quasiparticle peak with a set of plasmon satellites separated from the quasiparticle by multiples of the plasmon energy .",
    "the spectra in the gwa shows only one plasmon satellite located at a too high energy , approximately 1.5 @xmath637 below the quasiparticle which is similar to the core electron case .",
    "the cumulant expansion method remedies this problem and yields spectra in good agreement with experiment regarding the position of the satellites .",
    "the relative intensities of the satellites with respect to that of the quasiparticle are still in discrepancy .",
    "this is likely due to extrinsic effects corresponding to the interaction of the photoemitted electron with the bulk and the surface on its way out of the solid resulting in energy loss .",
    "these are not taken into account in the sudden approximation .    when applied to valence electrons with band dispersions",
    "the cumulant expansion does not yield the exact result anymore as in the core electron case .",
    "surprisingly , the numerical results show that the cumulant expansion works well even in al with a band width of @xmath32711 ev . considering its simplicity ,",
    "it is a promising approach for describing plasmon satellites .",
    "the gwa has been applied by now to a large number of systems , ranging from atoms , simple metals , semiconductors , transition metals , clusters , and surfaces and interfaces . in practically all of these systems ,",
    "the gwa improves the quasiparticle energies relative to the lda eigenvalues .",
    "the reason for the success of the gwa may be understood qualitatively by the fact that it is correct in some limiting cases as described in the introduction .",
    "the gwa includes an important physical ingredient in extended systems , namely screening or polarization of the medium which is absent in the hfa .",
    "it is well known that the neglect of screening leads to unphysical results in metals such as zero density of states at the fermi level and in semiconductors and insulators to too large band gaps .",
    "even in atoms , the inclusion of polarization effects lead to a significant improvement on the hf eigenvalues .",
    "since screening is a common feature in all electronic systems , it is perhaps not surprising that the gwa works in a wide variety of materials .",
    "it is also known empirically that second order perturbation theory often takes into account most of the physical effects , in particular the shifting of quasiparticle energies .    despite of the success of the gwa , it has naturally some shortcomings .",
    "one of these is related to satellite structure in the photoemission spectra .",
    "since the gwa describes a coupling of the electrons to one plasmon excitation , represented by @xmath82 , multiple plasmon excitations observed in the alkalis are clearly beyond scope of the gwa .",
    "this problem is remedied by the cumulant expansion theory described in section vii - c .",
    "apart from plasmon - related satellites , there are also satellite structure originating from short - range interactions .",
    "this type of satellites appears in strongly correlated materials containing 3d or 4f orbitals .",
    "the gwa is based on the rpa screening which takes into account the dominant part of long - range ( small momentum ) screening .",
    "short - range ( large momentum ) intrasite interactions of multiple holes usually present in strongly correlated systems are therefore not well described by the gwa . here",
    "a t - matrix type approach may be appropriate as has been shown by model calculations .",
    "apart from problems with satellite , there are also in some cases discrepancies in the quasiparticle energies .",
    "for example , the band width in na is @xmath675 10 % too large within the gwa compared with experiment but these discrepancies are relatively small .",
    "another shortcoming is the absence of spin - dependence in the screened interaction @xmath82 since the screening is purely coulombic .",
    "the spin dependence enters only through the green function .",
    "one would therefore expect some problems when applying the gwa to magnetic systems where spin - spin correlations are important as indicated by @xmath0 calculations on transition metal atoms .",
    "this area of research has not been explored extensively and it would require inclusion of vertex corrections to take into account spin - spin correlations . a t - matrix approach may be a first step in this direction .",
    "most @xmath0 calculations performed so far are not self - consistent , i.e. the green function used to calculate the self - energy is not equal to the green function obtained from the dyson equation with the very same self - energy . only very recently such self - consistent calculations were performed for the electron gas .",
    "the results turn out to be worst than the straight @xmath0 calculations ( one iteration ) and clearly show a cancellation between the effects of self - consistency and vertex corrections . in some way it is a blessing since fully self - consistent calculations are numerically difficult to perform for real systems .",
    "one interesting aspect of the self - consistent calculations is that the total energies are in very good agreement with the qmc results .",
    "a recent finding shows that when the total energies are calculated within the luttinger - ward functional and its extension ( almbladh , von barth , and van leeuwen 1997 ) using approximate @xmath69 and @xmath82 the results are almost equally good , which circumvents the need for self - consistent calculations ( hindgren 1997 )",
    ". this could be due to the variational property of the functional and the fact that the self - consistent gwa is conserving in the sense of baym and kadanoff .",
    "calculating total energies within the gwa could be an alternative to the qmc method , particularly for extended systems .",
    "due to computational difficulties , applications of the gwa to large and complex systems are still not feasible .",
    "simplified @xmath0 schemes , which are computationally efficient and yet maintain the accuracy of the full calculations , are therefore very desirable .",
    "many schemes have been proposed but most of them are designed for semiconductors . while they give reliable band gaps , details of the band structure are not fully accounted for .",
    "reliable schemes must probably take into account non - locality as well as energy dependence of the self - energy . with efficient schemes , many interesting problems",
    "can then be tackled .",
    "these include chemisorption at surfaces , 3d impurities in semiconductors , interfaces , band off - sets in heterojunctions , and exotic materials such as fullerenes in their diverse forms .",
