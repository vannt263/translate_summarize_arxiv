    "we here consider the asymptotic behaviour of certain unitary @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "these are defined in a previous work . in particular",
    "we consider the following @xmath1 s : @xmath2 with all even @xmath3 from 2 to 32 .",
    "previously the case @xmath4 was considered in @xcite but the largest @xmath5 considered was @xmath6 . here to insure we are truly in the asymptotic region we extend this to @xmath7 .",
    "also we improve the method of analysis .",
    "part of the motivation for this work comes from @xcite where we found that some coupling matrix elements were surprisingly small .",
    "we also consider cases where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , e.t.c .",
    "we are dealing with numbers which range from one to exceedingly small values e.g. @xmath10 so it is necessary to have very high precision in the calculations of @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "we have found that wolfram s mathematica fits the bill provided it is used correctly .",
    "one must enter numbers as fractions rather than decimals e.g. 1001/2 rather than 500.5 .",
    "as was noted in @xcite at first glance @xmath11 seems to fall of exponentially with @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests a form @xmath12 for this form @xmath13 . if this were true there would be a linear relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "we will here also consider other values of @xmath3 as indicated above .",
    "we first plot , in figures  [ fig : firstexp ] to  [ fig : lastexp ] , @xmath15 vs @xmath5 for some even @xmath3 values between @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "the curves indeed looks like straight lines indicating that the @xmath17 s drops exponentially with @xmath5 .",
    "this is certainly the dominant trend but there are small deviations indicated by the error analysis .",
    "we try a more elaborate form @xmath18 we consider the ratio @xmath19 and compare this with @xmath20 we therefor have for the extracted @xmath21 @xmath22 it should be noted that in the large @xmath5 limit @xmath23 approaches @xmath24 .",
    "we plot some selections of @xmath21 vs. @xmath5 in the attached figures  [ fig : firstm ] to  [ fig : lastm ] .",
    "we find that all even @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath25 , @xmath21 converges to 1.5 in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "it is important to note that in order to obtain the asymptotic value of @xmath21 in eq.([eq : asymp ] ) one must go to a sufficiently large value of @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore the bigger the value of @xmath3 the higher one has to go in @xmath5 . to show the perils of chasing the maximum j too small",
    "suppose we choose it to by 500.5 , which a priori most would consider to be a very large number .",
    "the values of @xmath21 for @xmath26 respectively 1.495 , 1.481 , 1.391 , 1.085 , and 0.577 .",
    "we now see a steady decrease in @xmath21 as @xmath3 increases , which could lead to the false conclusion that there is a different asymptotic value of @xmath21 for each @xmath3 .",
    "however when we choose @xmath5 large enough e.g. up to 7000.5 for @xmath16 we see that the asymptotic value of @xmath21 is the same for all even @xmath3 up to @xmath16 , namely @xmath27 .",
    "we next consider @xmath17 for the largest values of @xmath3 .",
    "we start with @xmath28 and then also consider @xmath29 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    "we find that @xmath31 approached a constant for large @xmath5 . then up to a certain point",
    "@xmath17 drops off as @xmath32 where @xmath33 e.g. as @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "asymptotic decreasing exponential behaviors for @xmath38 coefficients have been presented by varshalovich et al . in section 9.9",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig : firstimax ] to  [ fig : lastimax ] .",
    "igal talmi in @xcite has an analytic formula for the case @xmath39 ( figure  [ fig : imax ] ) as shown here : @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "talmi has also shown that for the case @xmath42 ( figure  [ fig : firstimax ] ) , @xmath1 goes asymptotically to @xmath43 .    a formula involving many factorials for the case @xmath44 is also given by varshelovich et al . in sec.10:8:4 eq.(14 ) in @xcite .",
    "we finally remind the reader that our motivation for this work comes from our desire to ether understand the wave function arising from a `` maximum @xmath45-pairing '' hamiltonian @xcite .",
