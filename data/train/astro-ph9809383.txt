    "galactic black holes ( gbhs ) in their hard state and radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have similar x - ray spectra which are well explained by comptonization of seed soft photons in a hot cloud with scattering optical depth @xmath7 and temperature @xmath8 kev ( see reviews by zdziarski et al .",
    "1997 ; poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "the compton reflection feature in observed spectra and a fluorescent iron line indicate the presence of relatively cold gas in the vicinity of the x - ray source .",
    "the most likely reflector is an accretion disk , and the hard x - rays are possibly produced in a hot corona of the disk ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; liang 1979 ) .",
    "the dissipation of magnetic energy in the corona may feed the x - ray luminosity ( galeev , rosner , & vaiana 1979 ) , while the underlying accretion disk reprocesses the incident x - rays and supplies seed soft photons to the corona .",
    "a self - consistent disk - corona model was developed , in which the coronal plasma is cooled by its own radiation reprocessed in the disk ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "the slope of the emerging x - ray spectrum is then determined by the fraction of the x - ray luminosity which comes back to the source as a reprocessed soft radiation . in a self - consistent model ,",
    "this fraction equals @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the compton amplification factor of the hot corona .",
    "the resulting spectrum depends on the geometry of the corona .",
    "ovservations favour a patchy corona consisting of separate active blobs ( haardt , maraschi , & ghisellini 1994 ; stern et al . 1995 ; poutanen & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "the disk - corona model has recently been found to be in conflict with observations of cyg x-1 and similar black hole sources in the hard state ( e.g. , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) : i ) the observed spectrum is very hard which corresponds to a compton amplification factor @xmath11 and implies soft photon starvation of the hot plasma ( zdziarski , coppi , & lamb 1990 ) . the model predicts @xmath12 unless the active blobs are elevated above the disk at heights larger than the blob size ( svensson 1996 ) .",
    "ii ) the model with elevated blobs would yield a strong reflection component , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the solid angle covered by the cold matter as viewed from the x - ray source .",
    "the reported amount of reflection is small , @xmath15 .",
    "the photon starvation and weak reflection may be explained if the cold reflector is disrupted near the black hole .",
    "this would agree with the idea that accretion proceeds as a hot flow in the inner region ( shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; esin et al .",
    "1998 ; krolik 1998 ; zdziarski 1998 ) .",
    "one may fit the observed spectra with a toy model of inner hot cloud upscattering soft photons supplied by the surrounding cold disk or by dense cloudlets inside the hot region ( e.g. , poutanen , krolik , & ryde 1997 ; zdziarski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , the weak reflection does not necessarily imply that the inner cold disk is disrupted .",
    "one suggested alternative is that the apparent weakness of the reflection features may be due to a high ionization of the upper layers of the disk ( ross , fabian , & young 1998 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis remains to be done to check whether the highly ionized reflector is consistent with observed spectra .    in this letter",
    ", we suggest another alternative .",
    "we find that the disk - corona model may be reconciled with observations if the plasma in the active regions has a mildly relativistic bulk velocity directed away from the disk .",
    "we argue that the plasma heated in magnetic flares is likely to be ejected with such a velocity , especially if it is comprised of @xmath6 pairs .",
    "the usually exploited model for the corona formation is that of galeev et al .",
    "( 1979 , hereafter grv ) .",
    "according to the model , a seed magnetic field is exponentially amplified in the disk due to a combination of the differential keplerian rotation and the turbulent convective motions .",
    "the amplification time - scale at a radius @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the convective velocity .",
    "grv showed that inside luminous disks the field is not able to dissipate at the rate of amplification , and buoyant magnetic loops must emerge above the disk surface where the magnetic field may annihilate quickly .",
    "the rate of magnetic energy production per unit area of the disk equals @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic energy density and @xmath21 is the half - thickness of the disk . assuming that the magnetic stress @xmath22 is responsible for the transfer of angular momentum in the disk",
    ", one can compare @xmath23 to the total surface dissipation rate , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the sound speed in the disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "one then finds @xmath26 ( taking into account that @xmath27 in the grv model ) .",
    "hence , the grv mechanism is able to dissipate only a small fraction @xmath28 of the total energy .",
    "this is in conflict with the spectra of gbhs in the hard state , in which a large fraction of the energy is emitted in hard x - rays .",
    "recent simulations of magnetic turbulence in accretion disks indicate that the magneto - rotational instability is likely to drive the turbulence ( see balbus & hawley 1998 for a review ) .",
    "this instability operates on a keplerian time - scale which is typically @xmath29 times shorter than @xmath30 .",
    "it produces magnetic energy with rate @xmath31 , i.e. , fast enough to explain the bulk of energy release as magnetic dissipation .",
    "combined with the grv argument for magnetic buoyancy , it follows that a large fraction of @xmath32 may dissipate in the corona .",
    "the corona thus may be the place where magnetic stress driving the accretion is transported to and released . for a standard radiation pressure dominated disk , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "the magnetic field in the corona is likely to be strongly inhomogeneous and it is plausible that the main dissipation occurs in localized blobs where the magnetic energy density , @xmath35 , is much larger than @xmath36 given by the standard model .",
    "the accumulated magnetic stress may suddenly be released on a time - scale @xmath37 ( the `` discharge '' time - scale , see haardt et al .",
    "1994 ) , where @xmath38 is the blob size .",
    "this produces a flare of luminosity @xmath39 , which may have a compactness parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the compact flares can get dominated by @xmath6 pairs created in @xmath41 reaction ( e.g. , svensson 1986 ) .",
    "pairs would keep an optical depth @xmath7 during the flare and upscatter soft radiation entering the @xmath6 blob .",
    "the blob temperature is typically in the range @xmath42 kev depending on @xmath43 and on whether there is a non - thermal @xmath6 tail .",
    "a strongly localized @xmath6 flare with @xmath44 may have a low temperature , @xmath45 kev , observed in some gbhs and agns .",
    "in the presence of a non - thermal @xmath6 tail , the flare may have even @xmath46 kev which is observed in the case of gx 339 - 4 ( zdziarski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "consider now one possible mechanism of bulk acceleration which should operate in an @xmath6 blob located above a reflector .",
    "the blob luminosity is partly reflected , and hence the pair plasma is immersed in an anisotropic radiation field . the net radiation flux , @xmath47 , must efficiently accelerate the light pairs .",
    "the time - scale for acceleration to relativistic velocities is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the accelerating radiative force .",
    "the shortness of @xmath50 implies that the bulk velocity saturates at some equilibrium value limited by the radiation drag ( e.g. , gurevich & rumyantsev 1965 ; sikora & wilson 1981 ) .",
    "we discuss the pair acceleration by reflected radiation in more detail in  4 .",
    "the bulk motion in the hot blob does not necessarily mean that the blob itself moves .",
    "instead , the dissipation region can be static",
    ". then the escaping pairs are replaced by newly created @xmath6 .",
    "the escaping pairs are immediately cooled down to the compton temperature @xmath51 kev .",
    "note that in a bright @xmath52-ray source , @xmath41 interactions would produce a lot of pairs above / between the active regions .",
    "an outflow of cold pairs covering the whole inner region of the disk may then be created ( beloborodov 1998a ) .",
    "it was noted previously that bulk motion of the flaring plasma may reduce the reflected radiation from an accretion disk ( woniak et al .",
    "reynolds & fabian ( 1997 ) calculated the impact of motion on the fe k@xmath53 line . here , we evaluate the amount of reflection and study how fast motion affects the coupling between the x - ray source and the reflector .",
    "we assume that the active blob luminosity is due to compton amplification of the reflected ( reprocessed ) radiation , and the multiply upscattered photons get isotropized in the plasma comoving frame .",
    "the angular distribution of the blob luminosity in the lab frame is then given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the angle between the ray and the plasma velocity , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the total luminosity of the blob . for a typical spectral index , @xmath59 ,",
    "the relativistic transformation of the specific luminosity , @xmath60 , is the same as that of the bolometric luminosity ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . in equation ( 1 )",
    ", we assume that the dissipation _ region _ is static and there is no retardation effect ( cf .",
    "rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . for",
    "a static blob with a life - time @xmath61 one may consider a time - independent picture in a fixed geometry like the usual disk - corona model .",
    "the only difference is that now the hot plasma in the blob has a bulk velocity .",
    "we will assume that the velocity is perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the x - ray luminosity striking the disk is then given by @xmath62 for a system inclination @xmath55 , the apparent strength of reflection , @xmath63 , is @xmath64    the reprocessed radiation from the disk is partly intercepted by the active blob .",
    "the intercepted soft luminosity may be expressed in terms of an effective @xmath65 , @xmath66 the case @xmath67 describes a slab geometry of the active region , while @xmath68 roughly corresponds to a blob with radius of order its height .",
    "the factor @xmath69 represents the efficiency of reprocessing , @xmath70 is the disk albedo ( e.g. , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath71 which returns as soft radiation is a function of @xmath72 and @xmath65 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 corresponds to the usual case of a static corona ( @xmath75 ) . with increasing @xmath72 ,",
    "the intercepted soft luminosity is suppressed .",
    "the spectral index of the comptonized radiation emerging from the blob is determined by the compton amplification factor taken in the plasma comoving frame .",
    "a luminosity @xmath76 transforms into the comoving frame as @xmath77 , where index @xmath78 stands for the comoving frame ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total flux of the soft radiation through the blob .",
    "we approximate @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "then @xmath86 which yields @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "we then get the amplification factor @xmath88}.\\ ] ] for @xmath89 , this expression can be approximated as @xmath90 within 1% accuracy in the range @xmath91 .",
    "here , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "we now estimate the expected bulk velocity for a pair - dominated flare using a simple toy model . the power consumed by the @xmath6 blob is the sum of two parts : the primary injected power due to dissipation of magnetic energy , @xmath100 , and the reflected radiation intercepted by the blob , @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is probably injected in the form of relativistic particles which are supposed to share their energy and momentum with the thermal @xmath6 plasma , most likely due to collective effects or due to synchrotron self - absorption ( ghisellini , guilbert , & svensson 1988 ) .",
    "let @xmath103 be the total vertical flux of the injected energy .",
    "the injected particles may accelerate or decelerate the thermal plasma depending on the angular distribution of injection .",
    "the reflected radiation always tends to accelerate the coronal plasma away from the disk .",
    "the energy streaming into the blob per unit time equals @xmath104 , and the corresponding net energy flux equals @xmath105 .",
    "the energy consumed during time @xmath106 increases the blob momentum by @xmath107 and the inertial mass by @xmath108 .",
    "the net acceleration is @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath6 plasma accelerates on a short time - scale ( see  2 ) , and the bulk velocity should relax to an equilibrium value for which the net acceleration vanishes .",
    "the equilibrium velocity is determined by the equation @xmath110 this equation also expresses the condition that the total energy flux vanishes in the comoving frame , @xmath111 .",
    "we do not possess a detailed model of injection in the blob and do not know the feedback of the plasma bulk velocity on the angular distribution of the injection .",
    "therefore , we consider two particular cases :    _ ( a ) @xmath102 is isotropic in the lab frame _    then @xmath112 , and the equilibrium condition ( 8) combined with ( 6 ) yields the relation @xmath113 on the other hand , @xmath114 is determined by equation ( 5 )",
    ". equating ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) , we get an equation for the self - consistent bulk velocity and find @xmath115 for @xmath116 .    _ ( b ) @xmath102 is isotropic in the comoving frame _    in this case , the energy flux associated with @xmath102 vanishes in the comoving frame and the equilibrium velocity is determined by the soft radiation only , @xmath117 .",
    "this yields @xmath118 for @xmath67 , and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "a proton fraction exceeding @xmath121 would increase the plasma inertia , and then the bulk velocity may fall below the equilibrium value .",
    "pairs will tend to stream through the heavy proton component and a plasma instability may be initiated . in the stationary case ,",
    "the stream velocity establishes itself just at the instability threshold which may be expected to be comparable with the thermal electron velocity , @xmath122 .",
    "the hard state of accreting black holes may be explained as a state in which a large fraction of the luminosity is released in a magnetic corona atop a cold accretion disk .",
    "the magnetic energy is probably generated by the magneto - rotational instability in the disk and then transported to the corona due to buoyancy .",
    "the soft state may be observed when the coronal activity is suppressed and most of the energy is dissipated inside the disk .",
    "the energy release in the corona is likely to proceed in compact bright flares , where the local radiation flux strongly exceeds the average surface flux from the disk .",
    "if the flaring plasma is comprised of @xmath6 pairs , it should be accelerated away from the disk by the pressure of the reflected radiation .",
    "the bulk velocity is then expected to be in the range @xmath123 .",
    "the radiative acceleration of a pair plasma is one possible reason for bulk motion in the flares .",
    "even if the flare is dominated by a normal proton plasma , the heating may be accompanied by pumping a net momentum into the hot plasma at a rate @xmath124 . the transferred momentum per particle per light - crossing time ,",
    "@xmath125 , is @xmath126 . as the flare duration @xmath61",
    ", the protons may acquire a momentum comparable to @xmath127 .",
    "note that magnetic flares where hot plasma is ejected towards the disk are possible .",
    "this case is formally described by equations ( 1 - 7 ) with @xmath128 .",
    "the impact of the source velocity on the observed reflection , @xmath129 ( eq . [ 3 ] ) , and the compton amplification factor , @xmath10 ( eq . [ 7 ] ) , is summarized in figure 1 .",
    "comptonization in the source produces a power - law x - ray spectrum . the photon spectral index , @xmath130 ,",
    "is related to @xmath10 by @xmath131 where @xmath132 for gbhs and @xmath133 for agns .",
    "this simple formula approximates within a few percent the results of calculations we performed by using the code of coppi ( 1992 ) ( see beloborodov 1999 for details ) .",
    "combined with equation ( 7 ) , this yields the dependence @xmath134 . assuming a typical @xmath135",
    ", one can approximate @xmath134 as @xmath136 for gbhs and @xmath137 for agns , where @xmath1 .    from the amount of reflection in cyg x-1 , @xmath15",
    ", we infer a bulk velocity of the emitting plasma @xmath138 for a system inclination @xmath139 ( see the bottom panel in figure 1 ) . on the other hand , from the reported intrinsic slope @xmath140 and the corresponding @xmath141",
    ", we again infer the same @xmath138 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 resolves the two problems of the disk - corona model mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the beaming of the corona luminosity , @xmath142 , also leads to the weakness of observed reprocessed blackbody component in the spectrum , @xmath143 .",
    "note that the inferred bulk velocity is comparable with the thermal electron velocity , @xmath122 for @xmath8 kev .",
    "the ejection model may apply to both gbhs and agns .",
    "the velocity of ejected hot plasma , @xmath72 , may vary ( and in some cases it might be @xmath128 ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath72 leads to decreasing @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "a correlation between @xmath129 and @xmath130 is observed in the spectra of gbhs and agns ( zdziarski , lubiski , & smith 1999 ) and it is well reproduced by our model ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "note also that fast outflows may manifest themselves in optical polarimetric observations of agns ( beloborodov 1998b ) .",
