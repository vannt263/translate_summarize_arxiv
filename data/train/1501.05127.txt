    "over the last two decades , the long lasting idea of globular clusters hosting single , simple stellar populations has changed dramatically . the classical paradigm of gcs being an excellent example of",
    "a simple stellar population , defined as a coeval and initially chemically homogeneous assembly of stars , has been challenged by observational evidence .",
    "the presence of chemical inhomogeneities , in most cases limited to the light elements ( the chemical pairs c - n , o - na , and mg - al anti - correlated with each other ) , have been known for decades and recognized to be the signature of high - temperature h - burning .",
    "this was initially framed within a stellar evolutionary scenario ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) given that gc abundance work based on high - quality data was limited to bright , evolved giants .",
    "it was only at the turn of the century that the availability of high - resolution spectrographs mounted on 8 m class telescopes made it possible to carry out studies on the compositions of stars down to the main - sequence , which revealed light elements variations analogous to those found among giants @xcite . given that the atmospheres of warm main - sequence stars in large part retain the composition of the gas from which they were formed , the unavoidable conclusion was that the abundance inhomogeneities are of primordial origin .",
    "the most extensive spectroscopic survey of gcs undertaken so far @xcite revealed that these inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in galactic gcs , though they do not appear to occur in other star formation environments .",
    "however , the extent of the inhomogeneity varies from cluster to cluster , and appears to correlate strongly with the present - day total mass of the gcs , and also with metallicity .",
    "the improvement in available instrumentation and techniques has also led to the discovery of a much higher degree of complexity of gc color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "in fact , while some clusters seem to photometrically comply with the simple stellar population paradigm , a growing number of them are found to be characterized by multiple main sequences and/or subgiant and/or giant branches , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , which have been associated to variations in the content of he and cno , as well as age spread @xcite .",
    "this observational evidence led to a general scenario where gcs host multiple stellar populations .",
    "these are often assumed to be associated with different stellar generations : the ejecta of the slightly older stars , probably mixed with varying amounts of gas from the original star forming cloud , creates subsequent younger generation of stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though alternative scenarios are also being considered ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is believed that only a fraction of the first - generation of stars can contribute to the internal enrichment .",
    "the difference in ages among the stellar generations is actually relatively small for the majority of the clusters ( with a few exceptions such as e.g. , @xmath2 cen or m22 ) and is confined to a couple of hundreds myr .",
    "the details of this formation scenario are still far from being understood .",
    "the origin of the polluting material remains to be established and it has obvious bearings on the timescales for the formation of the cluster itself and its mass budget . the observed wide star - to - star variations in c , n , o , na , and al found in each galactic gcs , coupled with the uniformity in fe and ca ( apart from a few notable exceptions ) provide quite stringent constraints and argue against anything but a minor contribution from supernovae @xcite .",
    "proposed candidate polluters include intermediate mass stars in their asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase @xcite , fast rotating massive stars losing mass during their main sequence phase @xcite , novae @xcite and massive binaries @xcite .",
    "these potential contributions obviously operate on different time scales and require a different amount of stellar mass in the first - generation .",
    "all of the candidates proposed so far fall short of reproducing the full variety of observations .",
    "advances in the theoretical modeling of star formation and evolution are likely needed to improve our understanding of these issues , including the spanning of a larger range of the parameter space ( e.g. , mass , metallicity , and mass loss ) . however , from an observational point of view , the increase in the high - quality abundance work available for gcs , both in the sheer number of stars and clusters , as well as in terms of chemical species considered , is paramount , as it creates a more complete picture of the phenomena involved .    the apache point",

    "* ) . with a nominal resolving power of 22,500",
    ", apogee is deriving abundances of up to 15 elements for nearly 100,000 stars , although fewer elements are generally detected in weak - lined metal - poor stars .",
    "apogee is in a unique position among the various galactic spectroscopic surveys such as gaia - eso , @xcite , rave @xcite , and galah @xcite , as it uses the sloan 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory @xcite , and thereby has access to the northern hemisphere .",
    "apogee observes a large sample of northern globular clusters , something that makes it possible to analyse these clusters in a homogeneous way , which has not been done before for these objects .",
    "the study of gcs with apogee plays an important role not just because it has access to many northern gcs .",
    "its high - resolution near - ir spectra allow the simultaneous determination of many elemental abundances generally not available in optical spectroscopic work of gc stars .",
    "c and n , which are elements heavily affected by the pollution phenomenon in gcs , are often not included in studies of metal poor stars because the strongest features ( ch and cn ) lie in the near - uv , far from the optical lines of na , mg and al , and thus multiple detectors or setups are required to obtain both sets .",
    "in addition , because these studies usually focus on fairly red stars longer exposure times are required to acquire sufficient snr to analyse the near - uv features .",
    "the spectra used in this paper are publicly available as part of the tenth data release ( dr10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of sdss - iii .",
    "the initial set of stars selected were the same used by @xcite to check the accuracy and precision of apogee parameters published in dr10 .",
    "however , instead of using the automatic aspcap pipeline , we will make use of photometry and theoretical isochrones to constrain the effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) and surface gravity @xmath4 , and use an independent semi - automated method for elemental abundance determination for 10 northern gcs .",
    "some of these clusters are well studied , such as m3 , m13 , m92 , m15 , while others have been poorly studied ( ngc 5466 ) , or been only recently discussed in the literature , such as m2 @xcite .",
    "table 1 lists the globular clusters apogee observed in its first year , along with the adopted [ fe / h ] , e(@xmath5 ) , and ages from the literature .",
    "targets were selected as cluster members if 1 ) there is published abundance information on the star as a cluster member , 2 ) the star is a radial velocity member , or 3 ) if it has a probability @xmath650% of being a cluster member based on their proper motion adopted from the literature . after this initial selection , we checked the position of stars in the t@xmath7 diagram based on apogee observations and deleted those that were not red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "stars that have metallicity 0.3  dex ( typically 3  @xmath8 scatter ) larger or smaller than the cluster average also need to be deleted , but this last step resulted in no rejections .",
    "the cluster target selection process is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the final sample consists of 428 stars from 10 globular clusters .",
    "high s / n spectra are essential to determine abundances from atomic and molecular features , thus all selected targets have at least s / n=70 as determined by @xcite .",

    "@xcite carried out a careful comparison with literature values using 559 stars in 20 open and globular clusters .",
    "these clusters were chosen to cover most of the parameter range of stars apogee is expected to observe .",
    "@xcite provided a detailed explanation of the accuracy and precision of these parameters , and also derived empirical calibrations for t@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and [ m / h ] using literature data . in the sections below we",
    "will briefly review these calibrations along with their limitations .",
    "we adopt a photometric effective temperatures calculated from the @xmath13 colors using the equations of @xcite .",
    "their calibration was chosen because of its proximity of only 30@xmath1440  k to the absolute temperature scale .",
    "de - reddened @xmath13 were calculated the same way as by @xcite , from @xmath15 , listed in table 1 for each cluster , using @xmath16 .",
    "the aspcap dr10 effective temperatures were compared with photometric ones using calibrations by @xcite based on 2mass @xmath13 colors @xcite . @xcite found that small systematic differences , in the range of 100@xmath14200k , are present between the aspcap and photometric temperatures .",
    "the aspcap dr10 t@xmath3 were also compared to literature spectroscopic temperatures , and the average of these differences were found to be negligible .",
    "the corrected aspcap dr10 temperatures were calculated between 3500  k and 5500  k using a calibration relation derived from the comparison with the @xcite scale .",
    "aspcap dr10 raw temperatures above 5000  k in metal - poor stars showed significant , 300@xmath14500  k offsets compared to photometry , and are thus believed to be not accurate enough for abundance analysis .",
    "this issue is mostly limited to metal poor stars , and does not affect stars at [ fe / h]@xmath171 , where the vast majority of apogee targets are .",
    "the adoption of a purely photometric temperature scale enables us to be somewhat independent of aspcap ( while still using the same spectra ) , which gives important comparison data for future aspcap validation . besides providing an independent comparison dataset for apogee , the photometric temperatures allowed us to include stars in the sample that are hotter than 5000  k. because of these reasons , the final results presented in this paper are based on the photometric temperatures , and we only use the aspcap dr10 raw temperatures to estimate our errors related to the atmospheric parameters .      the apogee dr10 release contains metallicities derived by aspcap for all stars analysed , thus providing an alternative scale to manually derived metallicities .",
    "that metallicity , [ m / h ] , tracks all metals relative to the sun , and gives the overall metallicity of the stars because it was derived by fitting the entire wavelength region covered by the apogee spectrograph .",
    "this is different from most literature publications that use fe lines to track metallicity in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "we use [ fe / h ] in this paper whenever we refer to metallicity presented here , because we use fe i lines to measure it . for the most part",
    ", one can treat values of [ m / h ] as if they were [ fe / h ] .",
    "when aspcap metallicity was compared with individual values from high - resolution observations from the literature , a difference of 0.1  dex is found below [ m / h]=@xmath141 , and this discrepancy increased with decreasing metallicity reaching 0.2@xmath140.3 dex around [ m / h]=@xmath142 @xcite .",
    "the calibrated dr10 metallicities map well onto [ fe / h ] , because the calibration process uses [ fe / h ] values from the optical .    because an alternative metallicity based on only iron lines did not exist for apogee in dr10 , and because of these small zero point offsets , we decided to derive our own [ fe / h ] based on fe i lines found in the h band , instead of using the published apogee dr10 [ m / h ] values .",
    "we assumed that all stars have the literature cluster mean metallicity before starting the calculations , after which small wavelength windows around the fe lines listed in table 3 were used to revise the individual star metallicities .      in this study",
    "we adopt gravities from stellar evolution calculations .",
    "following @xcite , we derive gravities for our sample using isochrones from the padova group @xcite .",
    "the cluster metallicities collected from the literature used in the isochrones are listed in table 1 , while the ages of all clusters were chosen to be 10 gyr .",
    "the final set of temperatures and gravities corresponding to them from the isochrones are listed in table 2 .",
    "the aspcap dr10 surface gravities were compared to both isochrones and kepler @xcite asteroseismic targets observed by apogee @xcite to estimate their accuracy and precision .",
    "an average difference of 0.3  dex was found at solar metallicity in both cases , but this increased to almost 1  dex for very metal poor stars .",
    "the asteroseismic gravities are believed to have errors in the range of 0.01@xmath140.05  dex , thus far superior to spectroscopic measurements , but they are only available for metal rich stars with [ m / h]@xmath181.0 . the discrepancy between spectroscopic and asteroseismic surface gravities is a topic of ongoing investigation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the final calibration from @xcite combined surface gravities derived from isochrones below [ m / h]@xmath191.0 with the asteroseismic dataset for high metallicities .",
    "values after the calibration still show some small ( @xmath200.1  dex ) offsets and large scatter around the isochrones for the globular clusters .",
    "thus , in order to minimize errors in abundances related to the uncertainty in the aspcap corrected spectroscopic gravities , we decided to use the pure isochrone gravities in this study .",
    "a relation between microturbulent velocity and surface gravity , @xmath21 , was used for aspcap analyses in dr10 @xcite . for consistency with aspcap , and for easier future comparisons with apogee results",
    ", we adopted that equation in this work .",
    "the program called _ autosynth _ was developed especially for this project to simplify the large amount of synthesis required for abundance determination .",
    "the program takes atmospheric parameters as input and carries out spectral synthesis to derive elemental abundances .",
    "the core of _ autosynth _ is moog2013 @xcite , which does the spectrum synthesis , while _ autosynth _ compares the synthetic spectrum with the observed spectrum and determines the best abundances with @xmath22 minimization in wavelength windows specified by the user .",
    "the program can read the moog formatted atlas and marcs model atmospheres , and can also convert the original atlas and marcs formats into a moog compatible format .    the line list adopted for this study includes both atomic and molecular species .",
    "it is an updated version of what was used for the dr10 results , version m201312160900 ( also used for dr12 , apogee s next public data release ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and includes atomic and molecular species .",
    "the molecular line list is a compilation of literature sources including transitions of co , oh , cn , c@xmath23 , h@xmath23 , and sih .",
    "all molecular data are adopted without change with the exception of a few obvious typographical corrections .",
    "the atomic line list was compiled from a number of literature sources and includes theoretical , astrophysical and laboratory oscillator strength values .",
    "these literature line positions , oscillator strengths , and damping values were allowed to vary in order to fit to the solar spectrum and the spectrum of arcturus , thus generating a tuned astrophysical line list .",
    "the solution is weighted such that the solar solution has twice the weight as the arcturus solution to properly consider the fact that the abundance ratios in arcturus are more poorly understood than those of the sun .",
    "the code used for this process was based on the lte spectral synthesis code moog @xcite but adapted to our unique needs . for lines with laboratory oscillator strengths , we did not allow the astrophysical gf value to vary beyond twice the error quoted by the source . a more detailed description of this process and the line list can be found in @xcite .",
    "the choice for the local continuum set can greatly affect the derived abundances , thus we needed a reliable automated way to determine the continuum placement .",
    "this was done with a separate @xmath22 minimization from the one that was used for the abundance determination .",
    "continuum normalized observation points around 1 are multiplied by a factor between 0.7 and 1.1 with 0.001 steps for each synthesis emulating slightly different choices for the location of the local continuum .",
    "multiplication is necessary because it preserves the original spectrum .",
    "the @xmath22 near the continuum is calculated and compared to the continuum of the observation and minimized separately for every abundance step .",
    "the @xmath22 calculation for the abundances determination happens between certain flux ranges ( usually between 0.3 and 1.1 ) using the continuum placement determined in the previous step .              the individual abundances were determined using the 1d local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) model atmospheres calculated with atlas9 @xcite .",
    "the model atmospheres were generated using solar reference abundances from @xcite , the same way as the main apogee model atmosphere database was generated @xcite . because the overall metallicity of these clusters were well known from the literature , initially we calculated atmospheres using the average literature metallicity for each cluster adopting the photometric effective temperatures and isochrone gravities .",
    "these initial model atmospheres were later revised to have consistency with the synthesis .",
    "the windows used to derive the individual abundances were determined based on the analysis of fts stars in the h@xmath14band using the apogee line list by @xcite . in the case of fe we measured [ fe / m ] , relative to the literature cluster metallicity for each line .",
    "the abundance of na is very important in discussing the spread of o in gcs , and two na lines are available in the apogee spectral band .",
    "however , these two na lines are weak even at solar metallicities .",
    "we carried out a number of tests attempting to derive na abundances , but we found that the two na lines become very weak around [ fe / h]=@xmath140.5 , and non - detectable below about @xmath24 , thus we were not able to determine na abundances for any of our targets .",
    "the list of wavelength regions used in our analysis , and the solar reference values for each element is listed in table 3 .",
    "figures [ fig : spectra1 ] and [ fig : spectra2 ] show examples of observed fe , mg , al , oh , co , and cn line profiles and their fitted synthesis for one star from m71 and m13 . the wavelength regions shown in these figures are only a fraction of what has been used from table 3 .",
    "cn lines spread over most of the h@xmath14band , hence it is important to calculate the cno abundances before the atomic ones .",
    "it is also important to use self consistent model atmospheres , because stars in globular clusters exhibit low carbon and high @xmath1content , which significantly alters the structure of the atmosphere compared to a solar scaled one @xcite .",

    ", we carried out calculations of temperatures with varied j@xmath14ks colors , reddenings and metallicities for m107 .",
    "m107 was chosen because it is the cluster with the highest reddening in our sample .",

    "the reddening of m107 was changed by 0.03 , simulating a 10% uncertainty in reddening , and this produced a difference of about 40  k in the photometric temperature . a change of 0.1  dex in metallicity results in 1  k or less uncertainty in temperature",
    "; thus the uncertainties in metallicity can be neglected . by adding the uncertainty from photometry and reddening in quadrature",
    ", we estimate the uncertainty of the photometric temperature to be about 100  k. the top panel of table 4 lists uncertainties associated with both 150 and 100  k changes in temperature .    in our methodology",
    "a 100  k change in temperature also introduces an 0.3  dex systematic difference in surface gravity , and 0.1  km / s in microturbulent velocity , so by coupling these two parameters to t@xmath3 , our systematic uncertainties include the investigation of abundance sensitivity to these parameters as well .",

    "then , the fit of each line is repeated while keeping all other parameters unchanged .",
    "the average differences between these two new fits and the original best - fit spectrum is the defined uncertainty associated with the fit itself .",
    "this uncertainty estimate is mainly sensitive to variations of noise in the spectrum in the defined windows for the @xmath22 fit .",
    "if its value is close to 0 , then the @xmath30 spectrum and @xmath31 spectrum give very similar , or the same abundances .",
    "this is expected when working at high s / n and with a well defined continuum .        while this uncertainty estimation method is reliable in most cases , it has its limitations for very noisy spectra , very weak lines , or when abundances are near upper limits . uncertainties are usually overestimated for noisy spectra , while they are underestimated for weak lines and upper limits .",

    "this is similar to the typical difference between spectroscopic and photometric temperatures reported by @xcite . because of the degeneracies in deriving stellar parameters ,",
    "the slightly higher temperatures in the literature are accompanied by a systematic offset of @xmath36  dex in @xmath4 .",
    "there are a few systematic differences between our abundance results and those in the literature .",
    "these can mainly be traced back to a change in the solar abundance scale as derived by @xcite .",
    "as one example , the [ fe / h ] metallicities we derive are typically @xmath37 dex higher than those from the literature , which is quite similar in magnitude to the change in a(fe)@xmath38 from @xmath39 @xcite to @xmath40 @xcite . also , the solar abundance of oxygen was revised significantly , from a(o)@xmath38=8.93 @xcite to 8.66 @xcite .",
    "since we use the more recent solar abundance values from @xcite whereas our earlier literature sources do not , we expect the @xmath41 dex offset visible in figure [ fig : litcomp1 ] . the systematic difference in [ n / fe ] abundance is also likely to be due to the updated solar abundances .",
    "carbon is the only element studied in this paper for which this explanation does not hold : although the solar abundance was revised down , from a(c)@xmath38=8.56 @xcite to @xmath42 @xcite , our [ c / fe ] values are typically lower than the literature values .",
    "unfortunately , literature values are available for only a subset of our stars , which makes it difficult to verify precisely any systematic behavior .    in the other elements we consider in the present study ,",
    "there is generally good agreement between our results and those from the literature , which is encouraging .",
    "however , we find significant differences in al abundances in stars with below - solar metallicities .",
    "this is mainly driven by stars in m3 , where the [ al / fe ] abundances from @xcite are larger than in the other literature sources .",
    "we also see significant scatter in [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] at low abundances ; this is likely caused by our abundance determination method having difficulty with weak lines .    the [ mg / fe ] versus [ al / fe ] relations in m3 , m13 and m5 provide useful examples of how our new data set compares with the literature . in m3 ,",
    "our abundance determinations show a clear bimodality in the mg - al distribution .",
    "the study of @xcite found a similar bimodality , but @xcite found a smooth distribution .",
    "in m13 we find an extended anticorrelation between [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] , and the literature abundances lie within it .",
    "we have seven stars in common with @xcite , and they span the full anticorrelation , while the three and two stars , respectively , that we have in common with @xcite and @xcite are consistent with our abundance results but happen to inhabit small regions of abundance space .",
    "m5 is a similar case , where our [ al / fe ] values span a range of @xmath140.3  dex to @xmath431.1  dex , while the @xcite al abundances are limited to between @xmath140.2 and @xmath430.7  dex . as in m13 ,",
    "our sample is larger than the literature sample , and covers the full rgb , while the literature sample does not fully span the parameter space .",
    "although there are well - known abundance patterns within globular clusters , large homogeneous studies that include a wide range of abundances are rare . since we can determine abundances of most of the light elements for the stars in our sample , we examine the behavior of the known abundance patterns across a wide range in cluster metallicity , and search for unexpected variations in the @xmath1elements . in this section",
    "we focus on the range of abundance within each cluster , to separate real abundance variations , bimodalities and trends from possible measurement errors .",
    "table 6 lists the average and standard deviation for each elemental abundance in each cluster .      in figures [ fig : femgal]-[fig : sicati ] we show all nine derived abundances as a function of effective temperature . from figure",
    "[ fig : femgal ] we conclude that we measure constant fe abundances in all of the clusters .",
    "mg and al abundances show a large range of values in some clusters ( as discussed in section 2 , and further in section 6 ) , but no significant trends with t@xmath3 except in m107 and m71 .",
    "this trend is very weak in m71 , and data are consistent with showing no trend within the uncertainties .",
    "however , in m107 the trend is stronger .",
    "we currently do not fully understand where these small correlations come from .",
    "we suspect that this is a result of a combination of effects .",
    "one such effect may be the use of model atmospheres that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , but that non - lte effects @xcite act to make the strong mg lines in these metal - rich stars give the appearance of higher abundance in the cooler stars .",
    "other possible effects are small systematic errors from estimating t@xmath3 and @xmath4 culminating during the synthesis .",
    "abundances are also sensitive to the microturbulent velosity , so if the @xmath44v@xmath45 expression used is not so accurate in this metallicity range , or the surface gravity is badly estimated , this propagates into systematically off abundances through v@xmath45",
    ".    the minimum [ c / fe ] ( figure [ fig : cno ] ) that can be measured from the co lines strongly depends on temperature .",
    "because rgb stars in gcs generally have low carbon abundances , we can only set upper limits for a number of our stars .",
    "our [ c / fe ] values are an average of the derived abundances from five co windows . as a result determining",
    "the upper limit is more challenging because co lines in certain windows disappear faster with rising temperature than in others .",
    "we carefully checked every co window fit and selected upper limits if the co band head was not visible in more than three windows by looking at the flatness of the @xmath22 fit around the minimum value .",
    "because the derived abundance of n from the cn lines is anticorrelated with the value of [ c / fe ] used , all stars with upper limits in [ c / fe ] have also lower limits in [ n / fe ] . these upper limits for [ c / fe ] and lower",
    "limits of [ n / fe ] are identified with open triangles in all figures .",
    "we see clear correlations between [ c / fe ] and t@xmath3 in m13 , m3 , m2 , and m5 when omitting upper limits .",
    "we interpret these as a sign of `` deep mixing '' , a nonconvective mixing process that causes steady depletion of surface carbon abundance and an enhancement in nitrogen abundance in all low - mass rgb stars @xcite .",
    "we derive only upper limits on [ c / fe ] for m15 , m92 , m53 and ngc 5466 because the co bands are quite weak at such low metallicity . with only upper limits ,",
    "it is not possible to identify abundance trends in these clusters .",
    "however , previous studies @xcite have found signs of the same deep mixing process in action in those clusters .    the only cluster in which we see a sign of nitrogen enrichment with declining temperature is m13 .",
    "possible trends in nitrogen are not necessarily a result of astrophysics , because in our methodology small systematic errors in temperature can result in systematic errors in n abundance because deriving [ n / fe ] is challenging from the cn lines .",
    "other than the relatively large errors of n , one also has to be careful with possible correlations of c and n with temperature , because they can be generated on the rgb as part of deep mixing and also in a previous stellar evolution event that are responsible for the pollution .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sicati ] there is a weak trend , on par with the error , visible in the si abundance in m13 , but not in the other clusters .",
    "while ca does not show any correlation with temperature , it does show temperature - dependent scatter in most of the gcs .",
    "the three ca lines used in our analysis are generally weak , and get significantly weaker above 4700  k , which leads to higher errors related to increased sensitivity to the uncertainty in the continuum placement .",
    "titanium , unexpectedly , shows a decline with decreasing temperature in m2 , m5 and ( marginally ) in m107 in figure [ fig : sicati ] .",
    "we suspect that inaccuracies in our analysis of the hotter star spectra are driving this apparent trend , since the s / n is lower for those stars than for the cooler , brighter giants . because these trends in mg ( figure [ fig : femgal ] ) , si and ti ( figure [ fig : sicati ] ) only show up in a handful of clusters",
    ", we believe that they are a result of difficulties in data analysis for certain lines in certain stars and not any systematic mishandling in , e.g. , @xmath46 estimation .",
    "we choose to fit these various observed trends with a linear equation , regardless of their origin , in order to explore the scatter around the trend .",
    "we fit lines to [ mg / fe ] in m107 and m71 , [ c / fe ] in m13 , m2 , m3 and m5 , and [ ti / fe ] in m2 and m5 .",
    "we are only using these fits to determine the internal scatter , which we define as the standard deviation about the fitted line . throughout the rest of this paper",
    "we use the abundance values directly , except when discussing the cn anticorrelations in section 6.4 .",
    "an internal abundance scatter significantly larger than the estimated errors suggests an astrophysical origin .",
    "in fact , significant scatter in n , o , mg and al is well documented in literature @xcite .",
    "the large star - to - star variations in these elements are the result of the cno , ne - na , and mg - al cycles , which play an important role in the nuclear fusion processes at the early stages of rgb ( cno ) and agb ( ne - na , mg - al ) evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : rms ] shows the internal scatter calculated as the standard deviation around the mean values ( in some cases around a fitted linear equation , as explained earlier ) , and the final combined estimated uncertainties from table 4 , as a function of cluster average metallicity .",
    "we note that the small number of stars analysed in ngc  5466 limits our ability to make a detailed analysis of c , n , and o in this cluster : because we were only able to measure the abundance of these elements in the three stars that have temperatures below @xmath47k , the scatter is unrealistically higher than the calculated uncertainty .",
    "the star - to - star scatter in [ fe / h ] is quite similar to our measurement uncertainties , indicating that no significant metallicity variations in the clusters are detected in this study .",
    "recently , @xcite have discovered three distinctive groups with different iron abundances in m2 .",
    "the first group has a dominant peak at [ fe / h]=-1.7 , while the second and third have smaller peaks at 1.5 and 1.0 , but the membership for the latter group is not conclusive .",
    "we see no such behaviour in m2 .",
    "the discrepancy between these two studies is most likely the result of a selection effect .",
    "@xcite selected stars that belong to a second rgb @xcite within the cluster , while our sample selection were based upon previous observations @xcite and all of our stars belong to the main rgb of this cluster .",
    "the @xmath1elements si and ti also show constant distribution , but the scatter in [ ca / fe ] is larger than our measurement uncertainties for most clusters in our sample .",
    "we attribute this to an increasing inaccuracy in [ ca / fe ] with rising temperature , as discussed in section 5.1 , and not a real range in calcium abundance .",
    "little to no range in iron and @xmath1elements is what we expect for normal globular clusters , although the clusters in which these abundances do vary are an intriguing puzzle ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "m107 stands out as having the largest discrepancy between the scatter of [ ca / fe ] and its estimated uncertainty .",
    "however , the large internal scatter is not related to astrophysics , but to spectral contamination from telluric oh lines . due to the cluster s radial velocity ,",
    "two of the three ca lines lie on top of atmospheric oh lines . because the telluric correction is not perfect ,",
    "the ca lines are compromised in a way that is not included in our uncertainty estimation .",
    "we do see scatter above the level of the uncertainties in some of the light - element abundances . in the case of carbon , we find that the scatter around the overall carbon depletion trend for m13 , m2 , m3 and m5 ( as shown by dashed lines in figure [ fig : cno ] ) is fairly small , although our measurement uncertainties get quite large at low metallicity .",
    "we do not see clear carbon depletion in m107 or m71 ; however , as discussed in @xcite , the rate of carbon depletion due to deep mixing is lower in higher - metallicity stars .    the range in [ n / fe ] abundance ( figure [ fig : rms ] , second panel from the top , in the left column ) in m71 , m107 , m5 , m3 , m13 , and m2 is clearly larger than the estimated uncertainties . however , the difference between the scatter and the uncertainty decreases with decreasing cluster metallicity , and below [ fe / h]=@xmath141.7 ( ngc  5466 , m53 , m92 , and m15 ) our derived [ n / fe ] values are all lower limits .",
    "the decreasing discrepancy is a result of larger uncertainties in more metal poor clusters , and the fact that the minimum n abundance of a cluster is slightly increasing as the average metallicity decreases ( figure [ fig : cno ] ) , while the maximum n is constant above [ m / h]=-1.7 .",

    "the scatter of [ mg / fe ] also closely follows the uncertainties , except for m15 and m92 where the most mg poor stars can be found .",

    "only the fraction of first - generation stars contribute to the pollution , and the time scale of the formation of these second generation stars depend on the nature of polluters ; it is a couple of hundred myr in the case of intermediate - mass agb stars , but it is only a few myr for fast rotating massive stars and massive binaries .    these first - generation pollutors are thought to have been fast rotating massive stars @xcite , or intermediate mass ( m@xmath48  3  m@xmath38 ) agb stars @xcite , or massive binaries @xcite .",

    ", we use the _ extreme - deconvolution _ ( xd ) method of @xcite to identify population groups and assign membership .",
    "this method fits the distribution of a vector quantity , here the elemental abundances , as a sum of @xmath49 gaussian populations , whose amplitudes , centers and covariance matrices are left entirely free .",
    "the algorithm can be applied to noisy or incomplete data , thus making the best possible use of all available data . in the current application ,",
    "xd s main advantage is the latter , since we are not able to measure abundances for all nine elements in all stars in our sample . similar to the @xmath49-means ,",
    "the number @xmath49 of populations to fit is an input to the algorithm ; xd itself does not determine the optimal number of components to fit the distribution .",
    "briefly , the xd algorithm works by optimizing the likelihood of the gaussian mixture model of the data .",
    "the optimization proceeds by an iterative procedure consisting of repeated _ expectation _ ( e ) and _ maximization _ ( m ) steps . in the e step , each datum is probabilistically assigned ( a ) membership in each population and ( b ) error - free values of each noisy or missing elemental abundance ; in the m step , each gaussian s parameters are updated using its members mean abundances and covariance calculated from the error - free values obtained in the e step .",
    "these steps are repeated until the likelihood stops increasing to within a small tolerance .",
    "the algorithm is proven to increase the likelihood in each em - step .",
    "we analyse each globular cluster in our sample using this algorithm , with the [ mg / fe],[al / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ ca / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] abundances as well as only [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] .",
    "we find that the two separate analyses provide nearly identical results , indicating that si , ca , and ti do not drive the populations . for m71 and m107 we used [ n / fe ] instead of [ al / fe ] , because al does not show any spread in these two clusters .",
    "we run xd using uncertainties given by the @xmath50final combined errors@xmath51 section in table 4 , and also without any uncertainties , and found that the two different runs produce identical results .",
    "we include missing abundance measurements by using a large uncertainty for these measurements .",
    "group membership for each star is determined using the best - fit gaussian mixture by calculating the posterior probability for each star to be a member of each population based on its elemental abundances and their uncertainties ; stars are then assigned to the population for which this probability is the largest .",
    "these membership assignments are typically unambiguous ( probabilities @xmath52 in most cases ) , with only a few cases for which the maximum probability is below 90  % .",

    "the difference may be explained by a simple selection effect , as @xcite observed 13 stars in m5 , while our sample size is 122 and covers almost the full extent of the rgb .",

    "two clusters , m53 ( 3.7@xmath8 ) and m5 ( 3.8@xmath8 ) , also show large @xmath8 detections , however , we would like to use a more conservative approach to the detection of anticorrelations out of a concern that our errors may be underestimated , given the degeneracies between stellar parameters and abundances in our analysis .",
    "m2 stands out as having no statistically significant mg - al anticorrelation .",
    "the summed abundance a(mg+al ) is expected to be constant as a function of t@xmath3 when material is completely processed through the mg - al cycle , and that is what our results show in figure [ fig : mgaladd ] .",
    "the only exception is m107 , but the slight correlation is due mg correlating with temperature ( see figure [ fig : femgal ] ) , and this trend was not removed here .",

    "those authors interpretation was that it is only in low - metallilcity clusters , where the agb stars burn slightly hotter , or in high - mass clusters , where the chemical enrichment is more efficient , that a si enhancement will be observed in second - generation gc stars .",
    "the difference in si abundance between the two xd - identified populations , listed in in table 8 , is significant relative to the error on that measurement .",
    "the si - al correlation in m15 is also accompanied by a si - mg anticorrelation ( figure [ fig : sicor ] ) , which is further evidence of @xmath0si being produced by hot bottom burning in agb stars @xcite .",
    "the spread of al abundances ( figure [ fig : rms ] ) also increases significantly below [ fe / h]=@xmath141.1 , thus we can conclude that high mass , low metallicity agb polluters that are able to process material at high , 60@xmath1470 million k , play an increasingly larger role in more metal - poor cluster .",
    "this behaviour of al abundances was previously observed by @xcite , but the larger range of al values presented in this paper make this correlation clearer .",
    "theoretical agb nucleosynthesis modeling indeed predict this behavior @xcite .",
    "the high - mass agb stars reach higher temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope ; i.e. , stronger hbb and advanced ( mg - al ) nucleosynthesis occurs with decreasing metallicity .",
    "we are seeing very advanced mg - al nucleosynthesis in the most metal poor clusters such as m15 and m92 , while the most metal - rich clusters like m107 and m71 do not show this , as theoretically expected , if the high - mass agb stars are the polluters .",
    "also , this is corroborated by the al - o anticorrelation ; the most al - rich stars are o - poor showing the effects of very strong hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , because hbb proceeds completely and destroys o.    an other related issue is that hbb is activated for lower masses with decreasing metallicity .",
    "high - mass and very low - metallicity agb stars don not exists in gcs today due to their extremely short lifetimes , but this trend seems to be confirmed both theoretically @xcite and observationally at least for solar metallicities down to that of the magellanic clouds . from the observational point of view , we know that high - mass agb stars in the small magellanic cloud ( [ fe / h]=@xmath140.7 ) activate hbb for progenitor masses ( m @xmath63 m@xmath38 ) lower than their solar metallicity counterparts ( m @xmath6 4 m@xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , at the lowest metallicities in m15 and m92 we also would expect more hbb agb stars ( i.e. , with several degrees of hbb and mg - al nucleosynthesis ) , because the minimum stellar mass to activate the hbb process ( and advanced mg - al nucleosynthesis ) decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "thus , we conclude that more polluted material would be present at the lowest metallicities .    because of these reasons",
    ", we believe that our results support and add some evidence to the high - mass agbs as gcs polluters .      .",

    "we see large star - to - star variations in n abundance in all clusters ; however , our inability to measure c abundances below [ fe / h]=-1.7  dex leads us to only having upper limits , and therefore we restrict the discussion of c - n anticorrelations to the more metal - rich clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : cnanti ] shows [ n / fe ] versus [ c / fe ] for all clusters .",
    "deep mixing has to be taken into account when discussing the cn anticorrelations , so in m13 , m2 , m3 , and m5 , where we see deep mixing clearly , the correlation of [ c / fe ] with t@xmath3 was removed . because deep mixing is not visible in m107 and m71 , we used the original values .",
    "a clear anticorrelation can not be seen in any of the clusters .",
    "while m107 and m71 show weak anticorrelations , neither of these is statistically significant .",
    "the anticorrelation itself may be obscured by the relatively large errors for [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] . as mentioned in section 5.1 , we see correlations of [ c / fe ] with temperature in m13 , m3 , m2 , and m5 , but these are not accompanied by increasing [ n / fe ] at the same time .",
    "we believe that this is due to our inability to measure c and n accurately : most of our abundance determinations are upper limits or close to them . if the anticorrelations exist , they must span ranges smaller than our uncertainties , which are always higher than 0.14  dex in [ c / fe ] and 0.12  dex in [ n / fe ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that in m3 , m107 and m71 there is a clear cn weak and cn strong group of stars , while in all more metal poor clusters , n abundances fill out a broad distribution .",
    "we have c , n , and o abundances available for a large number of stars , thus we are able to investigate the c+n+o content in each cluster in detail .",
    "studies from the literature showed that the c+n+o content in globular clusters are fairly constant to within 0.3  dex @xcite , except for n1851 where @xcite find a spread of 0.57  dex . according to @xcite the large spread in c+n+o in n1851",
    "is probably attributed to larger than usual pollution from lower mass agb stars than in other clusters , but these results were questioned by @xcite as they did not see spread of c+n+o larger than 0.3  dex .",
    "we also see near constant c+n+o in our sample , which is consistent with the material in these stars having undergone cno cycling in the first - generation of stars in the rgb phase . in figure",
    "[ fig : cnoadd ] we show a(c+n+o ) as a function of t@xmath3 .",
    "the spread is significantly larger than what is reported in literature , between 0.4 and 0.6  dex for m13 , m2 , m3 , and m5 .",
    "the spread in these clusters is at the level of what has been found in n1851 , but we think this is mostly associated with large uncertainties of [ n / fe ] measurements .",
    "we do not find clear separation in the amount of a(c+n+o ) between the two populations found in any of the clusters .",
    "as previously mentioned , there are currently two leading models to explain the nature of the polluters : the first assumes that intermediate - mass agb stars that are thermally pulsing and undergoing hot bottom burning expel material to the intra - cluster medium by strong mass loss @xcite , while the second assumes that the pollution comes from hot , fast rotating stars @xcite .",
    "according to the first theory , intermediate - mass hbb - agb stars could produce or not produce large c+n+o variations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this is because the c+n+o predictions ( which basically depend on the number of third dredge - up episodes ) for these stars are extremely dependent on the theoretical modelling , the convective model and the mass loss prescription used ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a ( c+n+o)-al correlation is not clearly visible in the lower panel of figure 10 .    according to the first theory , agb stars may explain a large spread in a(c+n+o ) because they are expected to produce a substantial increase in the c+n+o abundance as they enhance na and al and deplete o and mg @xcite .",
    "this should result in a ( c+n+o)-al correlation , which is not clearly visible in the lower panel of figure [ fig : cnoadd ] .",
    "weak correlations in m107 and m71 , and weak anticorrelations in m13 and m3 are visible , but they are probably the result of large uncertainties in c and n. more accurate measurements of [ n / fe ] will help to clarify the possible ( c+n+o)-al correlation .",
    "we investigated the abundances of nine elements for 428 stars in ten globular clusters using apogee dr10 spectra .",
    "a homogeneous analysis of these gcs has not been accomplished previously , something that apogee is uniquely able to do because it can observe all the bright gcs in the northern hemisphere .",

    "we find the following :    \\1 . from the examination of the star - to - star scatter in @xmath1element abundance , only o and mg show an abundance scatter larger than our measurement errors .",

    "population analysis using [ n / fe ] for m107 and m71 and",
    "[ al / fe ] in the rest of the clusters confirms that each cluster can be divided into two discrete populations , though in m107 and m71 that division is clearest in the n - al plane , whereas in the other clusters it is best made in the mg - al plane .",
    "the anticorrelation of mg and al is clearly shown in m15 , m92 , m13 and m3 , and to a lesser extent in m53 and m5 .",
    "interestingly , m2 , which is also a metal poor cluster , does not have a mg - al anticorrelation .",
    "the increased number of stars in our sample compared to the literature enables us to discover more al - rich stars , making the anticorrelation clearer in this dataset than in previous studies .",
    "the spread of al abundances increases with decreasing cluster metallicity .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical agb nucleosynthesis predictions by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that high - mass hbb agb stars , which are able to enrich al while destroying o , are more common polluters in metal - poor clusters than in metal - rich ones .",
    "a correlation between al and si in m15 indicates particularly high - temperature hydrogen burning in the stars that contributed the abundance pattern of the second - generation stars .",
    "this is consistent with si enhancement in globular cluster stars as discussed in the literature , where it appears to be confined to low - metallicity and high - mass clusters .",
    "besides accessing northern gcs , apogee is also unique among other spectroscopic surveys , because it is capable of measuring abundances of cno .",

    "<S> the spread of al abundances increases significantly as cluster average metallicity decreases as previously found by other works , which we take as evidence that low metallicity , intermediate mass agb polluters were more common in the more metal poor clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the statistically significant correlation of [ al / fe ] with [ si / fe ] in m15 suggests that @xmath0si leakage has occurred in this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we also present c , n and o abundances for stars cooler than 4500  k and examine the behavior of a(c+n+o ) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [ al / fe ] . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter of a(c+n+o ) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all clusters and independent on stellar temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a(c+n+o ) exhibits small correlations and anticorrelations with [ al / fe ] in m3 and m13 , but we can not be certain about these relations given the size of our abundance uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> star - to - star variations of @xmath1elements ( si , ca , ti ) abundances are comparable to our estimated errors in all clusters . </S>"
