    "the most important question for extrasolar terrestrial planet surveys is : _ which nearby stars should be searched for earth - like planets ? _",
    "( seager 2003 ) .",
    "we are living proof that stars like our sun can host habitable planets .",
    "thus , stars identical to the sun ( solar twins ) may be the best targets for future space missions that will probe earth - like planets for signs of chemicals that are only produced when life is present .",
    "since solar twins are very similar ( ideally , identical ) to the sun in their fundamental parameters ( e.g. , temperature , luminosity , metallicity , mass , age ) , their atmospheric parameters should be very well known , which makes them extremely important for the calibration of fundamental observables in astrophysics , such as the transformation from color to temperature .",
    "in particular , we do not yet know accurately the solar _ ( b - v ) _ color , for which the early literature ( 1957 - 1982 ) shows values from 0.615 to 0.685 ( cayrel de strobel 1996 ) .",
    "modern values ( 1994 - 2006 ) still show a large spread from a `` blue '' ( @xmath10.60 - 0.63 : straizys & valiauga 1994 ; taylor 1994 ; colina , bohlin & castelli 1996 ; sekiguchi & fukugita 2000 ; ramrez & melndez 2005 ) to a `` yellow '' ( @xmath10.64 : straizys & valiauga 1994 ; holmberg et al .",
    "2006 ) to a `` red '' ( @xmath10.65 - 0.68 : gray 1995 ; bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) _ ( b - v)_@xmath2 color .",
    "twins could be useful in the absolute flux calibration of terrestrial and space photometric systems .",
    "for example , the recent absolute calibration of the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the spitzer space telescope ( reach et al . 2005 ) yielded inconsistent ( by up to 7% ) results for a and k stars . with a photometric stability of just over 1%",
    ", irac is capable of high - precision photometry ; however , the accuracy of irac data is limited by errors in its absolute flux calibration .",
    "unusual variations in solar activity seem to be related to climate changes , as may be the case for the `` maunder minimum '' ( maunder 1890 ; eddy 1976 ) , a period of extremely low solar activity that is related to a `` little ice age '' ( eddy 1976 ) .",
    "thus , it is of the greatest importance to monitor the activity of stars very similar to the sun .    the identification of stars closely resembling our host star will be of great benefit in answering the long - standing question of the uniqueness of the sun ( e.g. , gustafsson 1998 ) , allowing us to fairly determine whether the sun is anomalous or not .",
    "cayrel de strobel ( 1996 ) reviewed the efforts made in the first 25 years of the search for solar twins and concluded that none of the large number of stars analyzed is a `` perfect good solar twin . ''",
    "although a perfect solar twin has yet to be found , porto de mello & da silva ( 1997 ) found that 18 sco ( hd 146233 ) is `` the closest ever solar twin . ''",
    "soubiran & triaud ( 2004 ) show that 18 sco is the top solar analog in a sample of about 200 g dwarfs .",
    "very recently , king , boesgaard & schuler ( 2005 ) analyzed four twin candidates and suggested that hd 143436 is a solar twin as good as 18 sco .",
    "here we show that hd 98618 and 18 sco are the closest solar twins , both with fundamental properties very similar to our sun .",
    "the candidate solar twins were selected based on their blue - optical - red - infrared colors ( ramrez & melndez 2005 ) , chromospheric activity , v sin @xmath3 , hipparcos parallaxes and from previous spectroscopic analysis in the literature ( e.g. , valenti & fischer 2005 ) . the solar twin sample is being observed using hires at the keck i telescope during other observing programs .",
    "we are using the upgraded hires spectrograph with the highest resolving power ( r @xmath4 ) , covering @xmath10.4 - 0.8",
    "@xmath5 m on the `` blue , '' `` green , '' and `` red '' chips .",
    "so far , 16 candidates ( listed in table 1 ) have been observed in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "each star was observed for 1 - 3 minutes in order to achieve a s / n of at least @xmath1300 per resolution element ( or about 200 pixel@xmath6 ) at 671 nm . for most stars",
    ", we fulfilled this requirement . during each run ,",
    "a solar reflected spectrum was obtained by observing either ceres or vesta .",
    "the data were reduced employing the latest version of makee ( t. barlow 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "further data reductions ( doppler correction and continuum normalization ) were performed with iraf .",
    "sample spectra of the sun , 18 sco , hd 98618 , and hd 143436 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "orders falling on the `` green '' chip , which in our setup covers @xmath10.53 - 0.69 @xmath5 m , were scrutinized for the best lines available for analysis .",
    "we selected lines of moderate strength ( typically with line depths of 0.2 - 0.6 , but weaker and stronger lines were also included ) , unblended , relatively symmetric and free of telluric contamination .",
    "lines too close to the edges of the orders were discarded because of the greater uncertainty in fitting the continuum in these regions .",
    "we employed two basic criteria to determine how close a star is to the sun .",
    "the first criterion assessed the similarity between spectral lines in the sample star relative to the sun for different chemical elements . for each atomic line , we determined the relative difference in line depth @xmath7 employing the 3 closest pixels to the line center .",
    "we critically selected 206 lines of 10 ions , with the largest proportion ( 70 ) due to .",
    "a median @xmath8 was determined for each ion and errors were estimated .",
    "a perfect solar twin should have @xmath8 = 0 for lines of all the chemical elements , and although none was found , 18 sco and hd 98618 showed the @xmath8 values closest to zero ( i.e. , solar ) among the different chemical elements analyzed .",
    "the second criterion allowed us to identify how close a star is in temperature to the sun .",
    "the principle behind this is the excitation equilibrium of lines , which are very sensitive to effective temperature . for a star identical to the sun , the slope of a plot of @xmath7 ( ) versus excitation potential @xmath9 should be zero .",
    "in addition to the lines used in our first criterion , we selected four lines around 525 nm from the `` blue '' chip , three of them close to @xmath9 = 0 ev and hence allowing a better determination of the d(@xmath7)/d(@xmath9 ) slope .",
    "the results of the two criteria are shown in table 1 and figure 2 , where it can be seen that 18 sco is the best solar twin out of our candidates , with hd 98618 also appearing very close to the sun .",
    "figure 2 also shows that , according to our criteria , hd 143436 is no match for 18 sco , in contrast to the suggestion ( king et al . 2005 ) that they may be equivalent .",
    "in addition , we estimated the relative depths of the li feature at 6708  .",
    "hd 98618 and 18 sco have similar li profiles , which are both deeper than solar yet much closer to the sun s than the li profile of hd 143436 .",
    "hence , also considering the li abundance , hd 143436 is not a good solar twin . the spectroscopic log @xmath10 (= 4.28 ) determined by king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is considerably lower than the trigonometric log @xmath10 from hipparcos parallaxes ( @xmath14.46 , using the t@xmath11 and mass given by them ) , which suggests errors in their analysis . since the spectroscopic log @xmath10 is too low ,",
    "the spectroscopic t@xmath11 given by king et al . is probably also underestimated .",
    "it is important to note that our analysis is strictly differential and independent of model atmospheres , with both the sample and reflected solar spectrum ( vesta or ceres ) obtained employing the same hires setting and during the same run and the data reduction and continuum normalization performed in the same way . on the other hand ,",
    "king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a lunar spectrum obtained several years earlier , and their observations are of lower resolving power ( r @xmath1 45,000 ) .",
    "the set of lines used is also different ; while king et al .",
    "cover 647 - 675 nm , our lines cover 522 - 675 nm .",
    "note that part of the region used by them has weak telluric contamination .",
    "the top twin candidates , 18 sco and hd 98618 , were analyzed in more detail to quantify their likeness to the sun by performing a differential spectroscopic equilibrium analysis with respect to the solar spectrum .",
    "the close proximity of our candidates to the sun warrants reliable _ relative _ chemical and physical parameters .",
    "the equivalent widths of 39 and 14 lines with clean profiles and well - defined continuum regions were measured in the region 439 - 675 nm .",
    "the @xmath12-values of and lines were taken from the oxford ( e.g. , blackwell , lynas - gray & smith 1995 ) and hannover groups ( e.g. , bard & kock 1994 ) and from melndez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , respectively .",
    "oxygen and lithium abundances were obtained from the triplet at 777 nm and the profile at 670.7 nm .",
    "the interaction broadening constants @xmath13 were obtained from the collision broadening cross sections given by barklem , piskunov & omara ( 2000 ) and barklem & aspelund - johansson ( 2005 ) .",
    "the lte calculations were performed with the 2002 version of moog ( sneden 1973 ) , employing kurucz overshooting model atmospheres ( castelli et al .",
    "the microturbulence v@xmath14 was determined by requiring no dependence of the iron abundance from lines ( a@xmath15 ) against reduced equivalent width ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the zero point of the excitation and ionization equilibrium was defined by the analysis of the solar and lines : ( da@xmath15/d@xmath9)@xmath2 and ( @xmath17)@xmath2 (= a@xmath18 - a@xmath15 ) . for the sun we adopted the atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath11 , log @xmath10 , [ fe / h ] = 5777 k , 4.44 , 0.0 ) , which was also adopted as a first guess for the twin candidates .",
    "then the parameters of the sample stars were iteratively changed in ( @xmath19t@xmath11 , @xmath19log @xmath10 , @xmath19[fe / h ] ) until we simultaneously achieved _ relative _ excitation and ionization equilibrium : + ( da@xmath15/d@xmath9)@xmath20 = ( da@xmath15/d@xmath9)@xmath2 + ( @xmath17)@xmath20 = ( @xmath17)@xmath2 + the stellar parameters so determined were used to obtain stellar masses and ages from y@xmath21 isochrones ( demarque et al .",
    "once the mass was estimated , a spectroscopic luminosity was obtained from log ( @xmath22/@xmath23 ) = log ( @xmath24 ) - log(@xmath25 ) + 4 log ( t@xmath11/t@xmath11@xmath2 ) .",
    "we employed hipparcos parallaxes to check both the surface gravities and luminosities obtained in the present spectroscopic analysis . the trigonometric gravity ( log @xmath26 ) and stellar luminosity ( @xmath27 )",
    "were calculated employing hipparcos parallaxes , v , m@xmath28 = 4.736 ( bessell et al . 1998 ) , and the bolometric correction + bc = -1.6240 + 4.5066 @xmath29 -3.12936 @xmath30 ( @xmath31 = 0.02 mag ) + where @xmath29 = ( 5040 k)/t@xmath11 .",
    "bc was obtained from a fit to solar metallicity dwarfs from alonso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and blackwell & lynas - gray ( 1998 ) ; the relation above is valid from about 4200 to 7000 k.    the spectroscopic and hipparcos - based results are shown in table 2 , where one can see the excellent agreement in both log @xmath10 and luminosity , which lends confidence to the results obtained in the present work .",
    "a comparison with previous differential spectroscopic analyses is shown in table 3 .",
    "all agree that the atmospheric parameters of 18 sco and hd 98618 are very similar to the sun , especially in t@xmath11 ( 1.1% or better ) .",
    "the differences in log @xmath10 and [ fe / h ] are just within a few times 0.01 dex , almost the same as the typical uncertainties .",
    "although within the uncertainties all these works agree with each other , the trigonometric gravities from hipparcos parallaxes ( table 2 ) favor our results .",
    "rotation periods and stellar ages can be obtained from measurements of stellar activity .",
    "table 2 shows the relative chromospheric activity indices ( log @xmath32 ) , chromospheric ages and rotation periods estimated by wright et al .",
    ". a better rotation period for hd 146233 is given by frick et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who analyzed time series of chromospheric activity .",
    "the rotation periods can be used to estimate a rotational age ( barry 1988 ) .",
    "the relation between age @xmath33 and rotation period @xmath34 also depends on mass [ log @xmath34 = a log @xmath33 + b log(@xmath24 ) + c ; kawaler 1989 ) , but since our stars have about 1@xmath35 , this relation simplifies to @xmath34 @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "barry ( 1988 ) finds that @xmath38 @xmath1 1/e , and using a mean solar rotation period ( equator to latitude 20@xmath39 ) @xmath40 @xmath1 25.3 days ( howard 1984 ) and a solar main - sequence age of @xmath41 = 4.51 gyr ( sackmann , boothroyd & kraemer 1993 ) , we find @xmath33 = ( @xmath34/14.5)@xmath42 , where @xmath34 is in days and @xmath33 is in gyr . using this relation , we estimated rotational ages ( table 2 ) adopting @xmath34 from frick et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and wright et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for 18 sco and hd 98618 , respectively .",
    "as shown in table 2 , 18 sco and hd 98618 are both very similar to the sun , with the surface gravity being just 0.01 dex higher than solar , the mass above solar by 2% , t@xmath11 hotter by 0.7% and 1.1 % , metallicity higher by 0.02 and 0.05 dex , and luminosity about 3% and 6 % higher , respectively .",
    "both stars belong to the disk population , and , as the sun , are orbiting the center of our galaxy at @xmath18 kpc ( nordstrm et al . 2004 ) .",
    "both twin candidates seem to be rotating slightly faster than the sun and are about 10% younger than the sun .",
    "the higher li abundance in 18 sco and hd 98618 is perhaps due to different amounts of pre - main - sequence depletion ( see , e.g. , ventura et al .",

    "estimate that undetected jupiter - mass planets orbiting nearby fgk stars ( @xmath4330 pc ) may reside in orbits beyond 3 au or have masses less than @xmath44 . since the distance at which an earth - size planet would receive the same amount of light from its star as earth receives from the sun is ( @xmath45)@xmath46au and the luminosities of the twin candidates are very close to solar , the habitable zones of 18 sco and hd 98618 should be very close to 1 au . if further radial velocity observations show that the inner region around 18 sco and hd 98618 is free of giant planets , then these stars have the potential to host terrestrial planets around their habitable zones .",
