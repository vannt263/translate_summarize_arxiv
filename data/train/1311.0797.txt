    "new surveys must be undertaken to find and characterise the full extent of the fainter population of symbiotic stars that are underrepresented in current catalogues ( e.g. belczyski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the strong h@xmath0 emission of symbiotic stars ensures that they stand out in large h@xmath0 surveys such as the int photometric h@xmath0 survey ( iphas ; drew et al .",
    "2005 ) and the aao / ukst supercosmos h@xmath0 survey ( shs ; parker et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the surveys constitute a promising discovery medium for new symbiotic stars with their excellent sensitivity to faint h@xmath0 emission line stars and large sky coverage .",
    "nineteen new symbiotic stars have so far been spectroscopically confirmed from the iphas survey ( corradi et al .",

    "mmu13 visually selected h@xmath0 emitters across @xmath535 deg@xmath6 towards the galactic bulge and spectroscopically confirmed 20 new symbiotic stars , as well as several other possible symbiotic star candidates .",
    "these new iphas and shs discoveries represent a typically fainter population than the known sample of symbiotic stars ( see e.g. figure 16 of mmu13 ) .",
    "no systematic survey to increase the number of southern galactic symbiotic stars has yet been made using the shs catalogue photometry .",
    "the shs contains catalogue photometry in three filters , an h@xmath0 interference filter , a short - red ( @xmath7 ) filter ( 59006900  ) that serves as an off - band for h@xmath0 , and an @xmath8-band filter ( see parker et al .",

    "miszalski et al . (",
    "2008 ) demonstrated shs catalogue photometry could be used to find h@xmath0 emitters , i.e. compact pne , forming the bulk of the mash - ii pn catalogue .",
    "the focus of mash - ii was , however , to identify new pne rather than symbiotic stars , resulting in a bias against h@xmath0 emitters with the nir colours of red giants .",
    "such symbiotic star candidates were unfortunately not recorded as part of the mash - ii survey .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an ongoing , systematic survey for new southern galactic symbiotic stars and present the first discoveries made from spectroscopic follow - up with the southern african large telescope ( salt ) .",
    "section [ sec : sel ] outlines the candidate selection from shs and 2mass catalogue photometry and sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] describes the salt spectroscopy .",
    "section [ sec : new ] introduces 12 new symbiotic stars and we conclude in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "appendix [ sec : other ] presents several other h@xmath0 emission line objects .",
    "during the first phase of this project relatively loose criteria were chosen to allow for several types of h@xmath0 emission line stars to be observed .",
    "these early non - symbiotic contaminants will inform stricter selection criteria and will help determine the completeness of the survey during later phases .",
    "we therefore postpone a full discussion of the symbiotic star candidate selection criteria until the spectroscopic follow - up of candidates is more advanced .",
    "nevertheless , we can outline here the candidate selection process during the first exploratory phase .",
    "catalogue photometry was retrieved from the shs website for h@xmath11 mag and shs field centres with ra@xmath1214 h. a variety of colour - colour and magnitude cuts were applied to the catalogue photometry using the stiltsmbt / stilts/ ] package of command - line tools for processing table data ( taylor 2006 , 2011 ) .",
    "the cuts were designed to incorporate the colours and magnitudes of mmu13 symbiotic stars that we have assumed to be repesentative of the relatively faint and reddened symbiotic star population that awaits discovery elsewhere in the shs .",
    "the resultant candidates were then cross - matched against 2mass using the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) cross - match service .",
    "further constraints were applied to the 2mass photometry and duplicates were removed using the 2mass i d as the unique name for each object .",
    "candidates were then visually inspected using colour - composite images as described in miszalski et al . (",
    "2008 ) , with promising candidates selected based on their similar appearance to mmu13 symbiotic stars .",
    "we observed several candidates spectroscopically with the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss ; burgh et al .",
    "2003 ; kobulnicky et al .",
    "2003 ) on the queue - scheduled southern african large telescope ( salt ; buckley , swart & meiring 2006 ; odonoghue et al . 2006 ) under programme 2013 - 1-rsa_pol-001 ( pi : miszalski ) .",
    "a single rss configuration was adopted with the pg900 grating and a 1.5 arcsec wide slit at a position angle of 0@xmath13 to give wavelength coverage from @xmath543407420   at a resolution of 6.2   ( full - width at half maximum , fwhm ) and a reciprocal dispersion of 0.97   pixel@xmath14 .",
    "two ccd chip gaps are present in rss spectra , approximately covering 53555415  and 64006460 , with the exact coverage and wavelengths depending on spectrograph flexure at the time of observation .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] records the 2mass point source catalogue designation , date and exposure time of the observations presented in this paper .",
    "the exposure time given corresponds to the long exposure that is taken after a short 30 or 60 s exposure to measure h@xmath0 unsaturated .",
    "a xenon arc lamp reference spectrum is taken after the long exposure , while no flat - field frames are taken .",
    "other candidates were also observed , but these will be included in future papers to help define the candidate selection criteria .",
    "relatively long exposure times were selected for most candidates to correspond with the relaxed observing conditions of the programme , namely any lunar phase , thin cloud and seeing up to 3.03.5 arcsec .",
    "the observations were therefore taken under a wide range of conditions and sometimes in considerably better seeing .",
    "three objects were observed during october when salt visibility windows were rapidly shrinking , necessitating very short exposure times .",
    "this meant two objects were observed well before astronomical twilight , namely 2mass j17422035@xmath152401162 and 2mass j18272892@xmath151555547 , observed 25 and 33 minutes before twilight , respectively .",
    "a higher priority weighting was given to objects with redder 2mass colours in an effort to address the difficulties in discovering d - type symbiotic stars ( corradi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010a ; mmu13 ) .",

    "basic reductions were applied using the pysalt package ( crawford et al .",
    "2010 ) and cosmic ray events were cleaned using the lacosmic package ( van dokkum 2001 ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the standard iraf tasks identify , reidentify , fitcoords and transform , and one - dimensional spectra were extracted using the iraf task apall .",
    "a relative flux calibration was applied to the extracted spectra using a spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard star ltt 6248 ( hamuy et al .",

    "the relatively short exposures of 2mass j17463311@xmath152419558 and 2mass j17422035@xmath152401162 that we present later have been lightly smoothed with a boxcar filter .            mag",

    ". they are classified according to the criteria given by lamers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , namely the presence of strong balmer emission lines , low excitation permitted emission lines ( e.g. fe  ii ) , forbidden emission lines of [ fe  ii ] and [ o  i ] , and a strong nir excess due to hot dust . the last property is evident in fig .",

    ". 2010a ) .",
    "the relatively high number of b[e ] stars found can be explained by the higher priority we gave to dusty d - type candidates in the salt queue .",
    "this was done in order to improve the chances of finding d - type symbiotics , which have proven difficult to find ( corradi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010a ; mmu13 ) , but this was complicated by several object types sharing h@xmath0 emission and hot dust .",
    "a search of simbad and vizier of the six b[e ] stars showed that some were misclassified as pne .",
    "stenholm & acker ( 1987 ) commented that only h@xmath0 was visible in their spectra for 2mass j18285064@xmath152432017 ( h  2 - 47 ) and 2mass j18500902@xmath150515041 ( tha 14 - 39 , the 1962 ) .",

    "finally , 2mass j14135896@xmath156709206 , listed as the h@xmath0 emission line star ss 255 ( stephenson & sanduleak 1977a ) , strongly resembles the b[e ] stars , however the 2mass colours do not show evidence for hot dust and the [ ni  ii ] emission lines are absent .",

    "other possible classifications for these two objects include a b[e ] star with no hot dust ( e.g. graus , lamb & oey 2012 ) or a pre - pn ( pereira et al . 2008 ) , but it is beyond the scope of this work to speculate further on this point .      the salt rss spectrum of 2mass j18143298@xmath151825148 in fig .",

    "while there are many galactic wc9 stars known ( e.g. van der hucht 2001 ) , it is interesting to note that dusty wc9 stars are more difficult to discover in nir selected samples ( shara et al .",

    "in conjunction with narrow nebular emission lines of the pn , the salt rss spectrum in fig . [",

    "this low ratio , combined with the relatively strong ( [ n  ii]@xmath16548+[n  ii]@xmath16583)/h@xmath0 ratio of 1.64 , suggests a firm pn classification , contrary to the candidate yso classification given by mottram et al .",
    "the situation is less clear for 2mass j18144673@xmath152035178 which has a relatively high ratio of 18 , calculated using the glimpse band 4 ( 8.0@xmath25 m ) flux ( benjamin et al . 2003 ; churchwell et al .",

    "the [ o  iii ] emission and the log ( h@xmath0/[n  ii ] ) and log ( h@xmath0/[s  ii ] ) line ratios of 0.51 and 1.18 , respectively , suggest a pn classification ( e.g. tajitsu et al . 1999 ) .",
    "other objects do not have the required data available to calculate their mir / radio ratios .",
    "the emission line pattern in 2mass j16490162@xmath153827431 appears to be typical of pne , so we consider it to be a pn . while the absence of [ o  iii ] in 2mass j16293215@xmath155215338 is suspicious , it otherwise appears pn - like , perhaps a pn with a cool ( @xmath26 kk ) central star , explaining our possible pn classification .",

    "both he  ii @xmath14540 and @xmath14686 are detected in absorption , together with a blue continuum , and he  ii @xmath15412 may also be present on the edge of the chip gap .",
    "the emission line pattern is somewhat unusual for a pn with the intensity of [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 exceeding h@xmath27 , indicating a high density environment . this places 2mass j18482874@xmath151237434 amongst a growing group of pne with a high density core ( hdc ) that may be symptomatic of some kind of dusty , wide binary interaction with a main - sequence companion ( see e.g. liebert et al .",
