    "the production of prompt photon pairs with large invariant mass is the object of continuing experimental studies ranging from fixed target @xcite , to colliders energies @xcite , especially by the cdf and d0 experiments at the tevatron .",
    "the word  prompt \" means that these photons do not come from the decays of hadrons such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . at large transverse momentum .",
    "prompt photons may be produced according to two possible mechanisms : either they take part directly to the hard subprocess ( direct mechanism ) , or they result from the fragmentation of large transverse momentum partons ( fragmentation mechanism ) . for a general discussion of the production mechanisms of prompt photon pairs , see ref . @xcite . besides offering an interesting probe of the short distance qcd dynamics ,",
    "di - photon hadroproduction is the irreducible background for the search of a neutral higgs boson in the channel @xmath5 in the mass range 90  -  140  gev at the lhc , which provides a strong motivation for its extensive study .",
    "collider experiments at the tevatron and the forthcoming lhc do not perform _ inclusive _ photon measurements . indeed , the inclusive production rates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs with large invariant mass are orders of magnitude larger than the one of prompt photon pairs , to which they provide the background .",
    "thus the experimental selection of prompt photons requires the use of isolation cuts . the isolation criterion used by the tevatron experiments",
    "cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite is schematically the following .",
    "a photon is said to be isolated if , in a cone in rapidity and azimuthal angle about the photon direction , the amount of deposited hadronic transverse energy @xmath8 is smaller than some value @xmath9 fixed by the experiment : @xmath10 the actual experimental criteria , which are defined at the detector level , are much more complicated than the simple one given by eqn .",
    "( [ isol ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "they can not be implemented in a partonic calculation .",
    "the schematical criterion of eqn .",
    "( [ isol ] ) is a modelization of their effects at the parton level .",
    "the topic of isolation of photons based on the above criterion is extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "besides the rejection of the background of secondary photons , the isolation cut also reduces the prompt photons from fragmentation .",
    "the stringent isolation requirements used by cdf and d0 suppress the fragmentation component quite a lot ; therefore , the effects of the fragmentation component are generally neglected beyond their lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "yet they can affect various observables in a sizeable way .",
    "for example , in the case of single photon production , it yields a significant increase in the transverse momentum distribution in the lower range of the @xmath11 spectrum @xcite .",
    "in a recent work , we presented a full next to leading order ( nlo ) study of di - photon hadroproduction based on a computer code of partonic event generator type , _ diphox _ @xcite . in this short article , relying on this general study , we illustrate the impact of beyond leading order contributions , especially to the fragmentation component , in di - photon production at the tevatron .",
    "higher order qcd contributions to a given observable lead to a refinement of theoretical predictions in several aspects .",
    "if already the born level contains the strong coupling @xmath12 , higher orders stabilize dependencies on arbitrary scales stemming from the truncation of the perturbative series . in the hadronic production of direct photon pairs",
    "this is not the case though it is in general true for the fragmentation parts .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of the nlo contributions allow for new initial states .",
    "the additional production channels are typically the reason for large @xmath13 factors .",
    "but higher order contributions also modify final state observables , as extra particles in the final state generate kinematical configurations which are forbidden at leading order and lead to sizeable effects distribution at @xmath14 @xcite . ] , especially if new collinear situations in the final states are possible .",
    "such effects can be seen in observables sensitive to kinematical configurations where the photons are emitted in rather close directions to each other .",
    "indeed , such configurations contribute only beyond leading order ( at lowest order , transverse momentum conservation forces the photons to be back to back in the transverse plane ) .",
    "moreover , the contribution of such configurations coming from the fragmentation mechanism is enhanced , as will be discussed below .",
    "a typical representative of this familly of observables is the distribution @xmath15 of transverse momentum of di - photons ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "[ fig : d0_qt ] shows the comparision between the d0 preliminary data and our theoretical computation taking into account the kinematic and isolation cuts of the d0 tevatron experiment .",
    "d0 requires @xmath17 for the photon rapidities , and the lower experimental @xmath11 cuts are @xmath18 which roughly correspond to effective cuts at respectively @xmath19 in a partonic calculation .",
    "furthermore , a lower cut in the two - photon acollinearity is required : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the photon - photon azimuthal angle and @xmath22 .",
    "the isolation criterion is modelized according to eqn .",
    "( [ isol ] ) with @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 .",
    "one can see a shoulder at about @xmath25 35 gev in the distribution measured experimentally . at first glance , one may question its significance , given the limited statistics of the run i data and the systematic uncertainties which affect these preliminary data .",
    "however a corresponding shoulder appears in the theoretical calculation performed with the same binning as the data too .",
    "a carefull study reveals that this shoulder is not a mere statistical fluctuation of the partonic monte - carlo generator , nor a binning artefact , but it is a physical effect .    in order to see this",
    ", we split the two - photon phase space into regions , according to the photon - photon azimuthal angle @xmath21 : @xmath26 since at leading order , the two body kinematics forces the photons to be back to back in the transverse momentum plane ( @xmath27 ) , the leading order contributions to @xmath15 come entirely from region ii , and vanish in region i. with respect to the above artificial slicing ( [ slicing ] ) , a  new channel \" opens at nlo - and beyond - which populates region i. however , as @xmath16 , the asymmetric cuts on the @xmath11 s of the photons imply that the contribution to @xmath15 from region i vanishes for @xmath28 with @xmath29 , so that this  new channel \" opens only above @xmath30 gev .",
    "it is instructive to examine separately the direct , and the fragmentation components[ftnt1 ] above this threshold .",
    "the direct component is displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : qt_shoulder](a ) .",
    "as @xmath31 increases above @xmath32 , the size of the opening slice of available phase space belonging to region i becomes comparable with the one of region ii .",
    "the direct component , which starts at nlo for @xmath33 , is by definition free of any final state collinear singularity .",
    "it thus involves only smooth variations with @xmath34 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , after a transition regime extending up to @xmath35  gev , the magnitudes of the contributions from regions i and ii become comparable .",
    "moreover the @xmath36 dependence , which comes from region i , is weak , @xmath37 at small @xmath36 . in summary the approximate doubling of available phase space due to the opening of region",
    "i above @xmath32 roughly amounts to a doubling of the direct component .    on the contrary ,",
    "the fragmentation component is collinearly enhanced when the two photons come close to each other . indeed , without the cut",
    "( [ acolln ] ) , contributions such as the one pictured in fig . [ fig : kinematics ] would make the fragmentation component logarithmically divergent for all @xmath31 larger than @xmath38 with @xmath39  gev .",
    "this divergence would be produced when the photon considered as  direct \" would become collinear to the one from fragmentation with respect to the typical single photon production rate . in practice ,",
    "the experimental cuts on the acollinearity @xmath40 of the two photons , or on the invariant mass of the pair , prevent from having to consider this regime . ] .",
    "the acollinearity cut ( [ acolln ] ) forbids this configuration ; yet a collinear enhancement survives in region i as a memory of this regime . as the slice of available phase space in region i opens , the fragmentation contribution from this region rises initially faster than the contribution from region ii decreases above @xmath32 .",
    "this generates a peak in the fragmentation component about @xmath25 30 - 35 gev , untill the contribution from region i decreases too . as a reflect of the collinear enhancement , the smaller the value of @xmath36 , the higher the peak . for @xmath32 above 25 - 30 gev",
    ", the fragmentation term comes mostly from region i , contrarily to the direct case .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : qt_shoulder ] which compares the case @xmath22 experimentally used and what would happen for @xmath41 , an artifical value chosen on purpose to emphasize this effect .    due to the fact that the fragmentation component is severely suppressed by the isolation cut  ( [ isol ] ) with respect to the direct one , and that the value @xmath22 experimentally used leads to a rather moderate enhancement of this fragmentation component , the effect of the latter is limited to a 10% modulation effect in the total (= direct + fragmentation ) distribution , so that the shoulder is mainly due to the direct component .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qt_rggcut_eb ] showing the ratio total / direct . however , the effect would be more spectacular with lower values of @xmath36 .",
    "for illustrative purpose , fig .",
    "[ fig : qt_rggcut_eb ] also shows what would be the situation with the value @xmath41 .",
    "the collinear enhancement in the fragmentation component affects also the distribution @xmath42 of azimuthal angle between the two photons in a pair , in the lower range of the @xmath21 spectrum , cf .",
    "[ fig : d0_phi ] .",
    "the contribution of the direct component decreases monotonically while remaining finite when @xmath43 decreases towards 0 . instead , the fragmentation contribution to this observable would diverge logarithmically at @xmath44 0 without the acollinearity cut ( [ acolln ] ) , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_rggcut_eb ] . the fragmentation contribution  feels \" this collinear divergence by rising again when @xmath21 decreases below @xmath45 towards @xmath36 .",
    "this divergence is forbidden by the constraint ( [ acolln ] ) .",
    "the latter produces a turnover when @xmath46 , which can be seen on the right plot on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_rggcut_eb ] in the lower range of the spectrum .",
    "one may wonder about the significance of these effects compared with the theoretical scale uncertainties associated with the arbitrariness of the renormalization and factorization scales used in the partonic calculation for the initial state factorization , final state fragmentation , and renormalization scales . ] .",
    "concerning the @xmath31 distribution , the direct contribution to the tail of the distribution above @xmath47 starts at nlo ( the born contribution to the direct component is concentrated at @xmath48 by transverse momentum conservation ) .",
    "as for the @xmath21 distribution , both the direct and fragmentation contributions to the tail of the distribution away from @xmath27 start at nlo too ( the respective born terms being concentrated at @xmath27 ) . for each of these two observables ,",
    "nlo is the _ effective _ lowest order .",
    "consequently , it is fair to say that these uncertainties are rather large .",
    "however scale uncertainties act roughly as an overall effect : they do not generate local distortions comparable to the pattern of effects studied above .",
    "we insist that the latter are _ physical _ effects , which could in principle be unambiguously observed among data with higher statistics and an improved understanding of systematics , as it may hopefully be the case in the forthcoming run ii of the tevatron .",
    "in this note we have emphasized nlo effects , coming in particular from the fragmentation contribution to di - photon production .",
    "we have pointed out that a new collinear sensitive situation arises in the fragmentation part at next to leading order , namely when the two photons become more and more close to each other .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the respective signal .",
    "stringent isolation criteria reduce the fragmentation contribution considerably and acollinearity cuts between the two photons forbid collinear photons in the experimental situation .",
    "consequently , these next to leading order effects from fragmentation are not very significant in the present data .",
    "however we have shown that the account of these contributions is required for an accurate description of the shapes of di - photon observables .",
    "they thus may become relevant for a precise understanding of the high statistic data to be collected during the forthcoming run ii at the tevatron .",
