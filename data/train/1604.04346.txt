    "since the first detection of highly ionized absorption lines in the late 1990 s , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy has provided great opportunities to probe disk winds in black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "disk winds are thought to have an equatorial structure , extending along the disk plane with a relatively small solid angle , because the lines are only seen in systems with high inclination angles larger than @xmath2 @xcite and do not show large orbital dependence of variability @xcite .",
    "the high mass loss rates , comparable to or even an order of magnitude larger than the mass accretion rates @xcite , suggest that disk winds play a key role in the dynamics of accretion onto compact objects , although how and how much they affect the accretion disks have been poorly understood .",
    "there are three major mechanisms proposed for powering the disk winds in low - mass x - ray binaries : radiation pressure , thermal pressure ( due to compton heating ) and magnetic processes .",
    "radiation pressure works effectively at near- or super - eddington luminosity , if gas is highly ionized .",
    "thermal winds can be launched from anywhere above a certain radius at which the isothermal sound speed of gas heated by x - rays overcomes the local escape velocity .",
    "this radius , called `` compton radius '' ( @xmath3 ) is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the black hole mass and compton temperature , respectively .",
    "more detailed calculations suggest that the thermal winds can be launched from smaller radii , @xmath70.1 @xmath3 @xcite , which correspond to @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 ( @xmath10 is the gravitational radius : @xmath11 ) in stellar - mass bh x - ray binaries .",
    "ionized gas located within @xmath3 remains bound to the surface of the accretion disks as hot atmosphere .",
    "since a wind is photoionized by x - ray radiation , its launching radius @xmath12 can be observationally estimated from the ionization parameter @xmath13 defined as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the ionizing luminosity and the number density of the wind , respectively .",
    "constraining @xmath16 directly is often not easy , and in such cases , the column density of the wind ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the length of the wind ) has been used under the assumption @xmath19 , to derive @xmath12 through the above equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that outflowing and static ionized absorbers in ns x - ray binaries have @xmath12 values consistent with the thermal driven winds and atmosphere , respectively .",

    "the wind velocities are about 1001000 km s@xmath20 , in agreement with the prediction that the winds are generated in the outer parts of the disks .    in 2005 ,",
    "a remarkable wind from gro j1655@xmath040 was detected with _",
    "high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum exhibited a rich forest of blueshifted ionized absorption lines .",
    "the estimated intrinsic luminosity ( 0.03 @xmath21 ( eddington luminosity ) @xmath22  erg  s@xmath20 for the solar abundances . ] ) is not very high and hence the wind can not be powered by radiation pressure .",
    "the thermal wind interpretation is also difficult , because this luminosity is just about the critical luminosity ( @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) below which the compton heating is not efficient enough to drive a thermal wind .    as the result of detailed photoinization modeling",
    ", the gro j1655@xmath040 wind was found to have an ionization parameter of @xmath24  erg  cm  s@xmath20 .",
    "the density was directly estimated to be @xmath25  @xmath26 from a density - sensitive line ratio of fe xxii . by using equation  ( [ eq_xiparam ] ) ,",
    "the radius was derived to be @xmath27  cm , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the radius at which thermal driven winds can form .",
    "the disk wind was thus explained by the remaining scenario , i.e. , a magnetic driven wind , although the observed outflow velocity ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath20 ) is lower than the local escape velocity at the radius of @xmath29  cm ( @xmath30  km  s@xmath20 ) and seems too low to drive a wind , unless it has a much larger velocity in the perpendicular direction .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that unusual properties in x - ray short - term variability and continuum spectra were seen around the _ chandra _ observation , from a comprehensive study of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) data , covering almost the entire outburst episode in 2005 .",
    "when a deep absorption structure emerged at @xmath31 kev , the hard x - ray flux was greatly reduced and a very soft x - ray spectrum appeared .",
    "the peculiar spectral shape was similar to that of the `` hypersoft state '' sometimes observed in the high mass x - ray binary cyg x-3 , which has a massive stellar wind from its wolf - rayet companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "meanwhile , the variability power above @xmath320.1  hz was gradually reduced as the observed x - ray flux decreased .",
    "they suggested that these behaviors are linked to the evolution of the disk wind or the accretion flow structure , yet the exact relations among them is still not completely clear .    in this article , we focus on the shape of the multi - wavelength sed of gro j1655@xmath040 and its evolution around the _ chandra _ observation during the outburst , and reconsider the wind in the context of the long - term behavior of the accretion disk structure .",
    "we use the _ rxte _ x - ray data and also simultaneous optical and near - infrared ( oir ) photometric data from the smarts ( the small and medium aperture research telescope system ) .",
    "the oir emission can be regarded as a reference of the intrinsic luminosity at the outermost part of the accretion disk , which would be less affected by reprocessing in the wind .",
    "the multi - wavelength seds thus allow us to connect the properties of inner and outer disks .",
    "in section  [ sec_longterm ] , we study the long - term x - ray and oir behavior around the _ chandra _ observation . in section  [ sec_spec ]",
    ", we analyze the multi - wavelength sed at the _ chandra _ epoch using a new irradiated disk model , and compare the result with that in the normal high / soft state . compiling all these results , we discuss the nature of the wind in section  [ sec_discussion ] .",

    ", we refer to the table given by @xcite as the solar abundances .",
    "the distance and inclination angle of gro j1655@xmath040 are assumed to be @xmath33 kpc @xcite and @xmath34 @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_lc ] shows the long - term x - ray and optical / nir behavior in the first @xmath3280 days of the outburst in 2005 , including the date of the _ chandra _ observation ( april 1 @xmath35mjd 53461 ) .",
    "the x - ray count rates are obtained with the _ rxte_/proportional counter array ( pca ) , and the oir fluxes are taken from the smarts photometric observations in the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 bands ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for the details of the observations ) .",
    "the most remarkable point is that the oir fluxes were monotonically increasing in the whole period , while the x - ray flux was decreasing before the _ chandra _ epoch .",
    "this can not be explained by an increase of the mass accretion rate alone . as noticed from the bottom panel of fig .",

    "we note that , among the 5 oir bands , the @xmath36-band flux should have the least fractional contribution of the blackbody emission from the companion ( a f6 iii - type star with a temperature of @xmath416300 k ; @xcite ) , and is dominated by the irradiated disk emission from the outer disk ( see section  [ sec_spec ] for more details ) .    using the oir fluxes and simultaneous",

    "we employed the standard data - reduction procedure described in the _ rxte _ cook book and extracted the pca spectra from the `` standard 2 '' data of the proportional counter array 2 ( pca2 ) and the hexte spectra from cluster a and b data for each observation i d .",
    "the oir magnitudes are converted to the fluxes , from which we produced spectra and response matrix files in the xspec format utilizing the ftool flx2xsp .",

    "[ fig_sed ] , the sed on mjd  53461 , the date of the _ chandra _ observation , is compared with that on mjd  53446 in the normal high / soft state , whose x - ray spectrum is well described by a multi - color disk ( mcd ) combined with a hard tail with a photon index of @xmath412 . note that mjd  53446 corresponds to the peak of the observed x - ray flux in the initial outburst rise .",
    "this figure shows that the x - ray flux levels decreased at all energies from mjd  53446 to the _ chandra _ epoch , whereas the oir fluxes increased .    moreover , a huge difference is present in the hard x - ray band .",
    "the difference is not just in normalization .",
    "the hard tail in the normal high / soft state is suppressed in the spectrum on mjd  53461 , which is dominated by the soft x - ray fluxes below 10  kev . as reported by @xcite",
    ", this x - ray spectrum can be described with a mcd plus an unusually steep power - law component with a photon index of @xmath425 .",
    "this peculiar hypersoft state was steadily seen from a few days before the _ chandra _ observation , after making rapid and frequent transitions between the normal high / soft and hypersoft states in the preceding @xmath4110 days .",
    "we note that , in figure  [ fig_sed ] , a significant depression is present at @xmath418  kev in the sed on mjd 53461 , which is likely an ionized iron - k edge along with absorption lines produced by the disk winds .",
    "this feature was always visible during the hypersoft state , and deepened without significant energy shifts , as the observed x - ray flux decreased ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as noticed in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_sed ] , the flux ratio of the two observations is almost constant in the soft x - ray band below @xmath325  kev , where the disk blackbody dominates .",
    "this indicates that the apparent disk luminosity ( @xmath43 ) decreased without significantly changing the inner disk temperature ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "in fact , the hypersoft state produces a vertical branch in the @xmath44 vs. @xmath43 diagram ( see figure 16 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this means that the evolution of the disk spectrum in the hypersoft state deviates from the standard @xmath45 relation .",
    "what is unusual in the hypersoft state is not only the characteristics of the sed but also fast x - ray variability .",
    "as reported by @xcite , the high - frequency part of the flat noise component was remarkably reduced in the hypersoft state , compared with that in the normal high / soft state . the break frequency in the high / soft state",
    "was located at @xmath415 hz , whereas during the hypersoft state , it moved to lower frequencies with decreasing x - ray flux , to reach @xmath410.1 hz at the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "they also found that the energy dependence of the pds shape was not strong , suggesting that the decline of the high frequency variability was not simply caused by the disappearance of the power - law tail .",
    "here we model the multi - wavelength seds of gro j1655@xmath040 in the normal soft state and at the _ chandra _ epoch in the hypersoft state to test the possibility that the peculiar behaviors in the hypersoft state are associated with the disk wind . using the oir data as a reference of the intrinsic emission from the outermost disk region , we investigate whether and how much the disk wind can affect the intrinsic x - ray emission at the _ chandra _ epoch .",
    "different spectral components ( the companion star , the outer parts of the accretion disk , the synchrotron radiation from the jets or the hot accretion flow ) can contribute to the oir emission of bh x - ray binaries ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for contribution from outer disks , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for that from jets , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for that from hot flows ) .",
    "normally , jet emission does not contribute in the disk dominant states .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the radio flux actually dropped down to an undetectable level and that jets were quenched in the hypersoft state .",
    "usually , the outer disk emission is the major contributor in outbursting bh x - ray binaries with a low - mass companion .",
    "the outer disk region is illuminated by x - rays from the inner disk and the comptonized corona , and consequently the reprocessed emission enhances the oir fluxes . to determine the accurate mass accretion rates through the inner and outer disks",
    ", we have to account for the intrinsic disk , compton - scattered , and reprocessed emission components in a self - consistent manner .    for this purpose , we use a new irradiated disk model named `` optxrplir '' and apply it to the multi - wavelength seds .",
    "this model is based on the optxirr model @xcite , which combines the two model implemented in xspec : `` optxagnf '' @xcite , the energetically - coupled disk plus comptonized corona model including color temperature correction , and the irradiated disk model `` diskir '' @xcite .",
    "using our new model , we can fully consider the emissions from the inner and outer disk self - consistently .",
    "the main difference between optxirr and our model optxrplir is the radial dependence of the x - ray flux irradiating the disk .",
    "the optxrplir model assumes that the illuminating flux does not scale with radius as @xmath46 , but @xmath47 .",
    "the reprocessed component in this model is thus more enhanced in outermost parts of the disk than the previous models .",
    "this radial dependence is derived from a more realistic calculation , by solving the hydrostatic and energy balance at each radius of a geometrically thin irradiated disk @xcite . in this condition ,",
    "the disk height increases at larger radii in proportion to @xmath48 due to heating by irradiation .",
    "the @xmath47 dependence was recently adopted to model multi - wavelength seds in the low / hard state ( @xcite ) . also , previous irradiated disk models describe the strength of the reprocessed component with one parameter @xmath49 ( the fraction of illuminating flux thermalized in the outer disk ) , while optxrplir separates it , for the convenience of calculation , into two explicit parameters : the geometry - dependent factor @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath50 is the height of the disk at the outer edge divided by the outer radius and @xmath52 is the albedo of the outer disk .",
    "we assume that the total x - rays , not only hard x - rays , are responsible for reprocessing .",
    "this is consistent with that the oir seds were not largely changed in spite of the huge difference in the hard x - ray tail between the high / soft state and the hypersoft state .",
    "the model includes two different comptonization components in the similar way as the optxagnf model .",
    "one is a power - law component extending to the hard x - ray band above 10 kev , which can be used to model the hard tail observed in the normal high / soft state .",
    "the other is a low - temperature thermal comptonization component , which can be used for the steep power - law component sometimes seen at slightly higher energies than a mcd component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the latter to model the steep power - law component in the hypersoft state . the former component ( hereafter referred to as `` power - law tail '' ) is described with a photon index and a cut - off energy , and the latter ( `` soft thermal comptonization component '' ) with an electron temperature ( @xmath53 ) and an optical depth ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the optxrplir model assumes that the power - law tail is generated from the gravitational energy dissipated within the radii from the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) to @xmath55 , and that the soft thermal comptonization component is produced between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "only disk blackbody emission ( including irradiation ) is emitted from the radii larger than @xmath56 .",
    "the rest parameters in the model are all taken from the optxagnf model ( the bh mass and spin , the distance to the system , and the eddington ratio ) and the diskir model ( the outer disk radius @xmath57 , and also @xmath50 and @xmath52 as explained above ) .        to analyze our multi - wavelength seds of gro j1655@xmath040",
    ", we use optxrplir as a full model of the irradiated disk emission and its comptonization .",
    "the oir fluxes also include the blackbody emission from the companion star , for which we use the bbodyrad model . throughout the sed analysis",

    "we confirm that the results of the spectral fits remain unchanged within the 90% error ranges when we adopt 5  @xmath73 and 10 @xmath73 ( below which @xmath78% and @xmath79% of the flux are generated , respectively ) as the outer radius .",
    "] , instead of integrating the smeared blackbody spectrum at each radius .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the kerrconv*optx model with this parameter setting gives a good approximation of relativistic disk models .",

    "since x - ray spectra in that state typically have a power - law tail but no significant thermal comptonization component , here we ignore the soft thermal comptonization component in optxrplir ( i.e. , @xmath55 is linked to @xmath56 ) . as for irradiation ,",
    "the strength of the reprocessed component is scaled with @xmath80 and it is difficult to constrain both @xmath52 and @xmath50 simultaneously in spectral fitting . here , we assume @xmath81 and leave @xmath52 as a free parameter to absorb uncertainties in the geometry of the outer disk . the eddington ratio ( @xmath82 ) , bh spin @xmath71 , and the photon index ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath55 of the power - law tail are also allowed to vary .",

    "since the oir to x - ray flux ratio became lower on mjd 53461 than that in the normal high soft state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lc ] ) , the model does not fit the x - ray spectrum .",

    "the discrepancy seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_fit ] can not be explained by absorption in the optically - thin wind detected by @xcite .",
    "we create a photoionized absorption model with xstar , employing the continuum spectral model in @xcite with a luminosity changed to 0.7 @xmath21 as an incident ionizing spectrum , and assuming the density of the wind as the value determined by them , @xmath99  @xmath26 .",

    "electron scattering in the absorber , which is not accounted for in the xstar code , can only decrease 30% of the radiation .",
    "the discrepancy is neither canceled out by taking into account the decrease of the mass accretion rate in the inner disk region due to the mass loss in the wind .",
    "@xcite estimated the wind outflow rate to be @xmath3210% of the mass accretion rate ( assuming that the outflow velocity perpendicular to the disk plane is not much higher than the line - of - sight velocity ) , and in the more recent work by @xcite , it was estimated to be @xmath3230% of the mass accretion rate .",
    "one possibility is that the disk wind made irradiation stronger than the normal high / soft state .",
    "the difference in the x - ray versus oir flux ratio is canceled out if @xmath49 at the _ chandra _ epoch is @xmath324 times larger than that in the normal high / soft state .",
    "it is difficult for disk winds to produce blackbody radiation by themselves , because they normally have much higher temperatures than those in the outer disks and are optically thin for free - free absorption . instead",
    ", they can contribute to the irradiation of the disk by scattering x - ray photons down and enhancing the illumination of the outer disk @xcite . in this case , the geometry - dependent factor for irradiation can be expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 represent the solid angle of the wind and the optical depth for scattering , respectively .    in our case , however , it is unlikely that the oir fluxes are enhanced by the optically - thin magnetic wind .",
    "spectrum predominantly shows absorption features instead of prominent p - cygni profiles , and hence @xmath104 must be fairly small .",
    "in addition , the disk at the location of the magnetic wind ( @xmath106  cm ) has a relatively high temperature and mainly produces photons with much higher energies than those in the oir bands .",
    "the emitting region is too small to substantially contribute to the oir fluxes . in the above modeling",
    ", the oir fluxes are dominated by the reprocessed emission from the outer edge of the disk at @xmath107  cm , where the temperature is @xmath108  ev . using the radial dependence of the temperature in the irradiated disk , @xmath109 @xcite",
    ", we estimate the disk temperature at the launching point to be @xmath110 times larger than that at @xmath57 . to investigate whether the reprocessed emission from the disk around the wind launching radius can explain the opposite behavior of the oir and x - ray fluxes , we add a bbodyrad component with a temperature of 7 ev to the model for mjd 53446 , and compare it with the sed at the _ chandra _ epoch .",
    "we find that the oir flux levels can not be reproduced unless we assume an unusually large solid angle at the launching point ( more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the disk ) .",
    "moreover , it is difficult for an enhanced @xmath49 alone to explain the trend in the soft x - ray spectrum : the inner disk temperature was not largely changed , while the observed x - ray flux was reduced .",
    "if the decline of the x - ray flux were produced simply by the decrease of the mass accretion rate in the inner disk region , the temperature should be reduced as well .",
    "considering all the above discussion , we conclude that an optically - thin wind is unlikely to be the main cause of the differences in sed between the normal high / soft state and the hypersoft state .",
    "instead , it seems more likely that obscuring gas is present between the x - ray and optical emission regions , reducing the intrinsic x - ray spectrum .",
    "the gas is likely to be very highly ionized and affect the x - ray radiation by compton - scattering , otherwise heavy absorption by less ionized material should modify the spectral shape in the soft x - ray band , inconsistent with the fact that it was kept almost constant in the hypersoft state ( see section  [ sec_longterm ] ) .",
    "thus , the origin of the gas could be a compton - thick , equatorial disk wind , strongly scattering - out the x - ray photons from the line of sight .",
    "we then fit the multi - wavelength sed at the _ chandra _ epoch using the soft thermal comptonization component implemented in optxrplir , to extract quantitative information of the observed very steep power - law tail and obtain a better sed model .",
    "we assume that the x - ray flux is scattered by an almost fully ionized , compton - thick wind , while the oir emission regions are located outside of the wind . under the presence of such a wind",
    ", it is difficult to predict whether @xmath49 becomes larger or smaller than that in the normal high / soft state , or remains constant .",

    "the condition that we try to model is quite complicated .",
    "we simply approximate the observed steep power - law component by the soft thermal comptonization component included in the optxrplir model .",
    "it assumes that the seed photons originate in the disk blackbody emitted from the inner disk region at radii within @xmath56 and that they are scatted by a one - zone cloud with given @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",

    ". the origin of that component could be a dense corona or a hot flow located in the x - ray emitting region , or perhaps a compton - thick disk wind in the outer disk region that strongly down - scatters x - ray photons and modifies the intrinsic spectral shape ( see section  [ sec_discussion ] ) . thermal compton scattering in an optically - thick cloud with arbitrary structures has not been prepared as an xspec model , and it is difficult to fit the sed directly with realistic models .",
    "moreover , we use one - zone homogeneous ionized absorption and scattering models to describe the disk wind , but the real structure would be more complex . the main purpose of this analysis is not obtaining the precise values of the fit parameters , but investigating whether and how much optically - thick compton scattering can reconcile the huge discrepancy shown in figure  [ fig_fit ]",
    ". numerical calculation of radiative transfer employing various structures of the comptonized cloud and disk wind would be needed for more detailed studies , which is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we leave it as a future work .",
    "we find that the multi - wavelength sed can be characterized by the above model consisting of a disk with a luminosity of @xmath113 and a optically - thick , low - temperature comptonization with @xmath114 and @xmath115  kev .",
    "figure  [ fig_fit_chandra ] plots the comparison of the data and the model , and figure  [ fig_model_chandra ] presents the same model corrected for neutral / photoionized absorptions and extinction .",

    "the model can still reproduce the observed x - ray spectrum by changing @xmath56 ( which can be regarded as the strength of the soft thermal comptonization component ) from @xmath119 to 50  @xmath10 , and the column density of the xabs and cabs components to @xmath120  @xmath61 .",
    "we have revisited the unusual wind detected with _",
    "chandra _ from the viewpoint of the long - term spectral and temporal evolutions in the x - ray and oir bands .",
    "a number of peculiar behaviors were found to appear simultaneously in the hypersoft state around the _ chandra _ observation , which are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the observed oir fluxes are monotonically increasing , whereas the x - ray flux starts decreasing before the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the b - band vs. x - ray flux ratio marks the minimal value just around the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "2 .   the observed disk luminosity becomes lower , while the inner disk temperature remains almost the same .",
    "the standard @xmath45 relation appears to break down @xcite .",
    "the power - law tail seen in the high / soft state spectra is replaced by a low - temperature optically - thick comptonized component , while the oir sed keeps almost the same shape .",
    "the absorption feature at @xmath418 kev is always seen , and it becomes deeper as the observed x - ray flux decreases @xcite .",
    "rapid variability is reduced as the observed x - ray flux decreased .",
    "the high - frequency break in the x - ray pds moves downwards from @xmath121 hz to @xmath122 hz . the break frequency correlates tightly with the observed 320 kev flux , while the energy dependence of the psd shape is not strong @xcite .",
    "these behaviors become most extreme at around the epoch of the wind detection with the _ chandra_/hetg .",
    "if they are not just a coincidence , they would be associated with the disk wind , since the ionized absorption feature always seen at @xmath123 kev suggests that the wind was steadily present in the hypersoft state .",
    "as already discussed , the evolution of the oir and x - ray fluxes can not be explained by an increase of the mass accretion rate alone . in this case , the x - ray flux should have monotonically increased as well as the oir fluxes .",
    "the decrease of the x - ray flux is too large to be canceled out by absorption and/or mass loss in the optically - thin disk wind detected with _",
    "it is also unlikely that an additional contribution from synchrotron emission from jets led to increase the oir fluxes , since @xcite suggest that jets were quenched in the hypersoft state .    one possible interpretation of the high oir versus x - ray flux ratio in the hypersoft state is that reprocessed emission from the outer disk became stronger than the normal high / soft state .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , powerful disk winds can enhance the irradiation of the disk .",
    "the flux ratio at the _ chandra _ epoch could be explained if @xmath49 , which is scaled with @xmath124 , was @xmath414 times larger than that in the normal high / soft state .",
    "this means that , if @xmath52 was constant , @xmath50 is 0.4 in the hypersoft state .",
    "this value seems somewhat too large , given that no strong emission lines are seen in the _ chandra _ spectrum . instead",
    ", a factor of 4 increase in @xmath49 may be achieved if @xmath52 decreased somehow in the hypersoft state .",
    "it may be also possible that the actual @xmath52 and @xmath50 values in the normal high / soft state are smaller than what we estimated and that @xmath50 increased in the hypersoft state .",
    "as explained in section  3.2.2 , we can not constrain @xmath50 and @xmath52 simultaneously , and we simply fixed @xmath50 at 0.1 in modeling the high / soft state spectrum . however , the launching radius of the wind estimated in @xcite is relatively small and thus its temperature is much higher than the outer edge of the disk , around which the oir photons are emitted ( see section  3.2.3 ) .",
    "it is difficult for the disk emission enhanced by that wind to contribute to the oir fluxes , unless we consider an unusually large emitting region .",
    "in addition , the larger-@xmath49 interpretation alone can not explain the peculiar behavior of the soft x - ray spectrum in the hypersoft state . if this were the case , the observed x - ray spectrum should directly reflect the intrinsic disk emission , and the trend in the disk luminosity versus inner disk temperature",
    "should indicate that the inner disk structure in the hypersoft state is different from that in the high / soft state , in which the inner edge of the standard disk is believed to extend to the isco stably ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some previous studies suggest that the disk is truncated at similar luminosities : in the bright low / hard state above @xmath125 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the very high state @xcite over @xmath126 @xcite . however , the properties of the hypersoft state are nothing like these states ; the x - ray spectra in the hypersoft state are much softer and the variability power on time scales of @xmath320.0110  s is more than one order of magnitude lower ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for spectral and timing properties in each state ) .",
    "moreover , disk truncation in these states produces a larger disk luminosity with a fixed inner temperature , which is the opposite behavior to that observed in the hypersoft state .    instead ,",
    "the evolution of the multi - wavelength sed could better described if @xmath49 is not so largely changed between the high / soft and hypersoft states and obscuring gas is present between the inner and outer disk regions , intercepting the line of sight and significantly reducing the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the obscuring material could be located in an equatorial disk wind .",
    "strong compton scattering in disk winds can reduce the intrinsic flux significantly , when we view them from a high inclination .",
    "recent radiative transfer calculations have suggested that the scattered / reflected component of massive winds significantly contributes to the observed seds @xcite .",
    "some observational hints of wind reprocessing have already been found in low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite implying that broad emission lines , blended with absorption features , could be explained by the reprocessed component of the winds . in our case , however , the compton - thick part in the wind would be almost completely ionized .",
    "such a wind can scatter out and reduce the intrinsic x - ray photons in the line of sight , without changing the spectral shape in the soft x - ray band nor generating additional significant atomic absorption and/or emission structures . as shown by our sed analysis in section  [ sec_spec",
    "] , this scenario can well explain the unusual trend in the disk spectrum .",
    "using the oir fluxes as a tracer of the reprocessed luminosity in the outer disk , we have demonstrated that the apparent x - ray flux at the _ chandra _ epoch can be @xmath71 order of magnitude lower than what is expected .",
    "similar very soft x - ray spectra with no or only a weak non - thermal power - law component are sometimes observed in other bh low - mass x - ray binaries , such as grs 1915@xmath127105 , xte j1550@xmath0564 , and gx 339@xmath04 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in their brightest phase .",
    "they appear in the luminosity range from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , which is consistent with the luminosity of gro j1655@xmath040 at the _ chandra _ epoch that we estimated in the sed modeling . in previous works ,",
    "the faint and/or steep power - law tail above @xmath3210  kev was usually considered to be produced in the inner disk region , and the entire x - ray spectra in that phase were often reproduced by models composed of the standard disk and its comptonized corona , or the so - called slim disk model , which describes accretion flows at very high mass accretion rates .    in the case of gro j1655@xmath040 , the scattered - in component of the compton - thick disk wind",
    "could also contribute to the observed comptonization component .",
    "the compton temperature of the disk wind is estimated to be @xmath1301 kev , by assuming the unabsorbed optxrplir model in figure  [ fig_model_chandra ] as the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "this is comparable to the electron temperature of the soft comptonization component .",
    "the fairly large difference between the optical depths of the scattered - in component ( @xmath131 , modeled by optxrplir ) and the scattered - out component ( @xmath132 , estimated from the column density of the cabs model , @xmath133  @xmath61 ) , may suggest that different comptonization components contribute to the soft component .",
    "however , considering uncertainties in the spectral modeling , we do not rule out the possibility that the total flux of the soft component is explained by scattering in the disk wind alone .",
    "we also note that the irradiated - disk emission enhanced by this compton - thick wind would not contribute to the oir fluxes greatly .",
    "this is because the wind is likely located at a much smaller radius than the outer edge of the disk ( see the next section ) and the relatively high disk temperature at that position requires a too large solid angle to produce the observed oir emission ( see also section  3.2.3 ) .      considering the definition of the ionization parameter",
    ", we can constrain the position of the compton - thick , almost completely ionized part in the disk wind , with respect to the less ionized part producing absorption lines .",
    "the radial dependence of the ionization parameter is derived from equation  ( [ eq_xiparam ] ) as @xmath134 . if the density profile can be written as @xmath135 , a wind is more ionized at larger radii under the condition @xmath136 , while it has the opposite dependence when @xmath137 .",
    "the former condition can be established if the disk wind is accelerated in its outer parts .",
    "the mass loss rate @xmath138 is described as @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 represent the solid angle and velocity of the wind , respectively .",
    "a positive radial dependence of the outflow velocity corresponds to @xmath136 , when the mass loss rate and the solid angle are kept constant .",
    "oppositely , the latter condition @xmath137 can be realized when the wind is decelerated .",
    "the former case means that the compton - thick region was located at a larger radius than that producing absorption lines , and that the latter part directly percepts the intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "the luminosity that we estimated is about 20 times larger than the ionizing x - ray luminosity assumed in the photoionized plasma modeling in previous works . since the launching radius depends on the square root of the ionizing luminosity ( see equation  ( [ eq_xiparam ] ) ) , it can be larger than that estimated in @xcite by a factor of @xmath7 4.4 .",
    "in addition , radiation pressure reduces the local effective gravitational force by @xmath142 , and thereby the compton radius is decreased by the same factor .",
    "thus , the two factors can compensate the 1-order - of - magnitude difference between the wind launching radius estimated from the _",
    "chandra_/hetg data and the minimum radius at which a thermal wind can be driven .",
    "the compton temperature estimated from our sed model ( @xmath143 kev ) gives the critical luminosity @xmath144 , and hence the intrinsic luminosity is sufficiently large to launch a thermal wind .",
    "by contrast , the x - ray photons illuminating the less ionized part of the wind should be already reduced in the latter case , @xmath137 .",
    "we suggest this condition would be more plausible than @xmath136 , considering the column density of the scattered - out component ( @xmath133 @xmath61 ) . approximating the density as @xmath145 , where @xmath18 is the size of the compton - thick part in the line - of - sight direction , and assuming the ionized parameter of that part as @xmath146 erg cm s@xmath20",
    ", we derive @xmath147 this value is smaller than the wind launching radius estimated by @xcite . a similar trend in @xmath13",
    "has recently been found in the re - analysis of the _ chandra _ data by @xcite . from a detailed analysis of the absorption line profile , they detected multiple components in the wind , where a more ionized part was located at a smaller radius .",
    "after @xcite first reported the _ chandra_/hetg result , the unusual wind in gro j1655@xmath040 has been revisited many times from both the observational and theoretical points of view @xcite .",
    "many previous studies were based on the assumption that the wind was optically thin and launched at a few percent of the eddington luminosity , in constructing photoionized plasma models and performing hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "if the wind was compton - thick and formed at near- or super - eddington luminosity , the effects of scattering in the wind and radiation pressure should be considered to discuss the wind driving mechanism . as described above",
    ", the launching radius of a thermal driven wind is smaller at a higher luminosity because radiation pressure reduces the effective gravity .",
    "a radiation pressure driven wind can be launched at even smaller radii above eddington luminosity .",
    "further numerical simulations and radiation transfer calculations at high mass accretion rates including the effects of compton scattering would be needed to test whether a compton - thick , almost completely ionized wind can be really launched and reproduce the observed properties .",
    "similar hypersoft x - ray spectra are sometimes detected in the high - mass x - ray binary cyg x-3 as well ( @xcite ; see @xcite for comparison of the two sources ) .",
    "this system always exhibits peculiar spectral states and lacks rapid variability on shorter time scales than @xmath320.1  hz .",
    "@xcite succeeded in describing spectral shapes and the timing properties in cyg x-3 by considering compton - thick scattering plasma , likely formed by dense stellar winds from its wolf - rayet companion star , with a low temperature ( 3  kev ) and a large optical depth ( @xmath148 ) like those of the observed thermal comptonization component in gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "they found that the break frequency ( @xmath149 ) in the x - ray pds is scaled by the size ( @xmath150 ) and the optical depth of the scattering cloud that reduces the intrinsic fast variability , through the following relation : @xmath151    this could be applied to gro j1655@xmath040 in the hypersoft state , if its low break frequency is caused by scattering in the compton - thick disk wind . using the optical depth for scattering in the line of sight ( @xmath152 ) and the break frequency ( 0.1  hz ) at the _ chandra _ epoch , we derive the size of the scattering gas to be @xmath153  cm , corresponding to @xmath154 .",
    "this value is much larger than the radius of the compton - thick wind estimated in section  [ sec_windloc ] and appears to favor a different interpretation that the compton - thick gas extends to the outermost disk region .",
    "we note , however , that there are other possible explanations for the suppression of the short - term x - ray variations in the hypersoft state .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the pds profile may be generated by the intrinsic variation of the accretion flow , or variable scattering in the wind due to density inhomogeneities ( see section  [ sec_ulx ] ) .",
    "a similar or more extreme disk wind might be observed in a previous outburst as well .",
    "the first detection of ionized absorption lines in gro j1655@xmath040 was brought by _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ; @xcite ) in the outburst starting from 1994 @xcite .",
    "ionized fe - k absorption lines were detected in two epochs , when the source exhibited similar x - ray continuum spectra but had different observed x - ray fluxes by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the ionized absorber was more ionized when the source was brighter , as was seen in the 2005 outburst @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray flux in the _ chandra _ observation falls between those at the two epochs reported by @xcite .",
    "a sudden flux drop was detected in the _ asca _ observation at the lower flux ( in 1994 august ) .",
    "the duration of the event was several hours , which was much longer than those observed in different periods ( on time scales of second or minute * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , in this `` dip '' event , the source kept almost the same continuum shape as outside it , unlike normal absorption dips in low - mass x - ray binaries , which accompany spectral hardening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the dipping period , the ionized fe - k absorption lines disappeared , while a deep absorption edge appeared at @xmath41 7 kev .",
    "this spectral behavior , which was described with double partial - covering absorbers in @xcite , is reminiscent of the behavior during the hypersoft state in the 2005 outburst .",
    "the similarity might suggest that the unusual `` dip '' event was produced by absorption and scattering in a more extreme wind with an even larger column density and an lower ionization parameter than that observed in 2005 , and that a large fraction of the intrinsic x - ray photons was scattered out in the wind .",
    "there is , however , no information of the spectral shape in the hard x - ray band above 10 kev for the _ asca _ data , hampering further comparison .",
    "if these peculiar behaviors in gro j1655@xmath040 seen around the _ chandra _ observation are indeed attributed to an optically - thick disk wind launched at a luminosity close to the eddington limit , they would carry important implications to massive winds thought to be formed at extreme mass accretion rates .",
    "recent radiation ( magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations predict radiation - pressure dominated , optically - thick disk winds to be driven in supercritical accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the ionized fe - k absorption lines like those observed in galactic bh binaries have never been observed in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite argued that uneven spectral structures often seen at @xmath411 kev could be explained by broad blueshifted absorption lines .",
    "recent deep optical spectroscopy revealed that the broad emission lines of h and he observed in ulxs ( and also ss 433 , which is the only known galactic x - ray binary thought to power persistent supercritical accretion ; see @xcite and references therein ) likely originate in dense , strong winds launched on supercritical accretion disks @xcite40 that we have considered . ] .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggest that massive optically - thick winds could be the origin of the soft comptonization component usually detected in ulxs .",
    "it has a low temperature ( @xmath413  kev ) and a large optical depth ( @xmath131@xmath155 ) , similar to those estimated for the thermal comptonization component in gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "thus , the unusual gro j1655@xmath040 wind , formed at around the eddington luminosity , may be smoothly connected to massive outflows from supercritical accretion flows .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have proposed a unified picture of the ulxs and the ultraluminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ulss , whose spectra are dominated by a blackbody - like component with a temperature of @xmath156  kev and have no hard tail ) , in terms of the effective optical depth ( @xmath157 ) of the supercritical winds : in ulss , the winds are effectively optically thick and we see only a blackbody emission , while ulx winds are optically thick to compton scattering but @xmath158 , and thus produce a comptonized component in the x - ray band .",
    "we note that @xmath159 in the case of gro j1655@xmath040 , when a temperature of @xmath321 kev and a density of @xmath160  @xmath26 are assumed to estimate the opacity of free - free absorption in the wind .",
    "recent simulations by @xcite demonstrated that the winds driven by supercritical accretion have a clumpy structure , which can generate variability .",
    "spectral / flux variation in ulxs that could be explained by the clumpy disk winds has been observed on various wavelengths and time scales , such as x - ray flux on a time scale of several tens of second @xcite and optical emission lines on @xmath1021-day time scales @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the clumpiness of the wind may contribute to the observed evolution of high - frequency variability in gro j1655@xmath040 .",
    "if the disk wind have the keplerian velocity in the rotating direction , 0.1-s and 10-s variations correspond to the blob sizes of @xmath161 and @xmath162 located at @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "if the bend in the x - ray pdss is produced by the absorption and scattering in a clumpy wind , variability at a lower frequency is generated by blobs with a larger size and/or located at a larger radius on the disk . in this case , the wind in the _ chandra _ observation should have the largest blobs or be located at the most outer region during the hypersoft state , although it is not clear what are the mechanisms that made change the geometry and/or inner structures of the wind .",
    "wind absorption and scattering may also significantly affect the spectra of normal galactic bh x - ray binaries , when they get close to the eddington luminosity . at high luminosities , the dependence of the disk luminosity ( @xmath43 ) on the inner disk temperature ( @xmath44 ) in the high / soft state start departing from the @xmath45 track for the untruncated standard disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "high inclination sources with absorption dips and winds , including gro j1655@xmath040 and 4u 1630@xmath047 , deviate downward from the relation in the @xmath43 vs. @xmath164 plane with increasing luminosity , while low inclination systems like gx 339@xmath04 and lmc x-3 do not show such a bend but sometimes go slightly upward .",
    "this apparent inclination - dependent discrepancy might be associated with optically - thick disk winds and explained as follows : in high inclination sources , we see the inner disk region through the disk wind , and the intrinsic x - ray emission is reduced due to scattering out of the line of sight . in contrast , lower inclination sources have larger contribution of the components scattered into the line of sight , which enhance the x - ray emission from the inner disk region . moreover ,",
    "compton down - scattering in the wind could decrease the observed inner disk temperature . if this is the case , the winds should be almost fully ionized , otherwise significant emission and absorption lines could be seen in low and high inclination systems , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity at the _ chandra _ epoch that we estimated is consistent with the energy range that the deviation is seen in other systems , and the gro j1655@xmath040 wind may be linked to that behavior as an extreme case .",
    "in this article , we proposed the possibility that the unusual wind in gro j1655@xmath040 was compton - thick and almost completely ionized .",
    "we demonstrated that the multi - wavelength sed can be reproduced by considering the effects of scattering in the wind .",
    "we found that the intrinsic luminosity could be close to or above eddington , which is much higher than that inferred from the observed x - ray flux .",
    "if this is the case , compton heating and radiation pressure could be more important to drive the wind . to test this possibility",
    ", detailed radiation transfer calculation should be made by fully taking into account the effects of scattering in the wind .",
    "we note a paper by @xcite , which has appeared very recently .",
    "they analyzed x - ray and oir data of gro j1655 - 40 obtained in the similar period and drew a similar conclusion to ours that the wind was compton thick .",
    "their interpretation is that the wind was much more powerful and launched at much more extreme mass accretion rate ( @xmath165 times as high as the eddington rate ) than that in our interpretation , and that most of the observed oir fluxes in the hypersoft state were produced by the emission from the cool photosphere of the wind itself , instead of the emission from irradiated disk .",
    "as discussed in section  3.2.3 , the wind in our model is likely to be optically thin for free - free absorption in the oir bands , but such a dense wind as suggested by @xcite may be effectively thick in the oir bands and generate blackbody emission .",

    "<S> this wind is the most convincing case for magnetic driving in black hole binaries , as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of 10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the optical and near infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the _ chandra _ observation , whereas the x - ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand . yet </S>",
    "<S> the optical and near infrared fluxes are from the outer , irradiated disk , so for them to increase implies that the x - rays likewise increased . </S>",
    "<S> we applied a new irradiated disk model to the multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the optical and near - infrared fluxes , we estimated the intrinsic luminosity at the _ chandra _ epoch was @xmath1 , which is more than one order of magnitude larger than the observed x - ray luminosity . these results could be explained if a compton - thick , almost completely ionized gas was present in the wind and strong scattering reduced the apparent x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of scattering in the wind should then be taken into account for discussion of the wind - driving mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> radiation pressure and compton heating may also contribute to powering the wind at this high luminosity . </S>"
