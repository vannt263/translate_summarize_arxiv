    "the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity is a fundamental problem in condensed - matter physics and it has been studied experimentally and theoretically for almost four decades .",
    "these two cooperative phenomena are mutually antagonists .",
    "indeed , the superconductivity is associated with the pairing of electrons states related to time reversal while in the magnetic states the time - reversal symmetry is lost and therefore there is a strong competition with superconductivity@xcite .",
    "however , schlabitz _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that surprisingly magnetism and superconductivity could coexist in the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "other heavy fermion superconductors have also been shown to exhibit magnetic moments in their superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "all these compounds contain rare - earth or actinide ions with very localized 4f or 5f orbitals , strongly interacting with the conduction band electrons .",
    "this is in contrast to the chevrel phases where magnetism and superconductivity coexist because the magnetic moments responsible for magnetism are only very weakly coupled with the electrons that form the condensate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are been a number of recent studies reporting the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order in r@xmath5ce@xmath6sr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite and rsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite where r = gd , eu .",
    "these latter compounds were originally synthesized by bauernfeind _",
    "_ @xcite and felner and co - workers @xcite .",
    "most recent reports have focused on gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 , which has a unit cell similar to that of the yba@xmath0cu@xmath8o@xmath9 high temperature cuprate , where there are two cuo@xmath0 layers and one ruo@xmath0 layer with the cuo@xmath0 and ruo@xmath0 layers being separated by insulating layers .",
    "magnetization and muon spin rotation studies @xcite have shown that there exists a magnetic ordering transition at temperature much greater than the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "some studies have been interpreted in terms of ferromagnetic order arising from the ru moment in the ruo@xmath0 layers .",
    "this idea has generated considerable interest because ferromagnetic order and superconductivity are mutually competing processes and could only coexist via some accommodation of the respective order parameters by a spatial modulation@xcite or via the formation of a spontaneous vortex phase @xcite .",
    "however , powder neutron diffraction study @xcite has shown that while there is a small ferromagnetic component , the low - field magnetic order is predominantly antiferromagnetic .",
    "these contrasting reports cast some doubt about the magnetic nature of this compound and at the present the situation has not been completely clarified . the aim of this paper is to give a contribution to this discussion .",
    "indeed , we have found that transport measurements performed on gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 sample are in agreement with predictions of a simple phenomenological model where _ ferromagnetism _ and superconductivity coexist . from the experimental results a curie temperature @xmath2=133k and a superconducting critical temperature @xmath3=18k , with an onset temperature @xmath4=33k , have been inferred .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the sample preparation is discussed . a phenomenological model for expected current - voltage curves",
    "is then given in section iii .",
    "experimental results are presented and discussed in connection with the theoretical prediction of the proposed model in section iv .",
    "some conclusions are finally given in the last section .",

    "the mixed powder was calcinated in air at 960 @xmath10c for 10  h. annealing in flowing pure nitrogen at 1000  @xmath10c during 10  h was performed to reduce the formation of undesired phases such as srruo@xmath8 @xcite .",

    "subsequently , the powders were oxygenated .",
    "seven oxygenation cycles of a mean duration of 10  h , were performed at 1060  @xmath10c in flowing pure oxygen .",
    "these fully oxygenated powders were pressed in pellets by means of an hydrostatic press .",

    "then , a last 90  h long cycle at 1070  @xmath10c and a refining one of 10  h at 1065  @xmath10c assured the complete oxygenation of the pellets .",
    "the crystal structure of the gdsr@xmath0rucu@xmath0o@xmath1 pellets was analyzed by x - ray powder diffraction method .",

    "[ fig3](c ) and ( d ) , the expected ac @xmath16 curves should look similar to the ones we plotted in fig .

    "conversely , for an antiferromagnetic order , a smoother distortion of the @xmath16 curve should be expected , and the area of the ellipse of the paramagnetic phase should decrease for temperatures below the neel temperature due to the decrease of the magnetic susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic phase when the temperature is lowered .",

    "the curves are in qualitative agreement with the calculated ones [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ] , resulting from the phenomenological model reported in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath16 curves show an hysteretic behavior at each temperature measured . below a certain temperature , an outward cusp - like distortion of the elliptical shape at t=256  k is evident in the curves .",
    "moreover , the loop area always increases when temperature is lowered .",
    "as stated in the previous section this means that a _ ferromagnetic _ phase is involved in the material .",
    "figure  [ fig5](b ) shows that the loop area increases with the frequency of the current sweep , as expected for an inductive ( magnetic ) contribution @xmath40 to the total voltage drop . by comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , a voltage contribution from a ferromagnetic phase is achieved . in the previous section",
    ", we have assumed that the electrical response of the material can be described as the series connection of a normal ( superconducting / resistive ) phase and a magnetic ( ferromagnetic / paramagnetic ) phase . when the material is a.c .",
    "supplied , the resistive ( normal ) component gives a reversible voltage signal , whereas the inductive ( magnetic ) one gives rise to an irreversible response accounting for the hysteretic shape of the voltage - current curves in the @xmath16 plane . in order to study separately the resistive and the inductive components of the measured @xmath16 curves , the reversible ( @xmath41 ) and the irreversible ( @xmath42 ) voltage were extracted in each curve .",
    "the reversible component in the total voltage signal , was calculated by using the simple formula @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the voltage values measured during the increasing and the decreasing branch of the sinusoidal forcing current .",
    "then , the irreversible component was extracted according to @xmath46    the irreversible part extracted from the total signal measured is shown in fig .  [ fig6](a ) .",
    "again , a qualitative agreement with the computed curves [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] is recognized . for temperatures ranging from 4.2",
    "k up to about 70  k , the loop area diminishes very slowly",
    ". then the area decreases quickly and smoothly changes shape becoming elliptical around @xmath2=133  k. from analysis of the previous section we identify @xmath2=133  k as the curie transition temperature of the magnetic phase in the sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) the reversible curves , ascribed to the resistive share in the total voltage signal , are shown for different temperatures .",
    "the typical non linear @xmath16 for a superconductor ( @xmath36 for @xmath47 ) can be recognized for temperatures below @xmath3=18  k while linear behavior is recovered above this temperature .    from data of the reversible curve , we extracted the resistance as a function of the temperature shown in fig .",
    "the temperature @xmath3 , corresponding to a full superconducting phase in the sample ( @xmath36 ) and the onset temperature @xmath4 were estimated 18  k and 33  k , respectively . in our measurements the non - linear behavior in reversible @xmath16 curves , can be recognized up to 18  k. increasing the temperature from t@xmath48 up to t@xmath49 the reversible @xmath16 curves are linear with a quite fast increase of the resistivity . above @xmath4 ,",
    "the measured resistance get lower and for @xmath2=133  k the resistance shows a peak . for temperatures above the magnetic transition temperature",
    "the resistance diminishes again .",
    "resistance versus temperature calculated by using the reversible @xmath16 curves.,width=264 ]    two main results can be drawn from the data above presented .",
    "firstly , we find a clear evidence of changes near 130k of irreversible and reversible components of the @xmath16 curves and therefore we infer that they could be ascribed to a ferromagnetic / paramagnetic - like transition .",
    "this speculation agrees well with the results reported in literature that find a magnetic ordering temperature at around 130k @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment below this temperature at a very low field suggests that the transition at t@xmath50 must have a significant ferromagnetic component .",
    "the experimental results also suggest that the ferromagnetic component persists to the lowest measured temperature attained in the experiments and does not appear to weaken when the superconductivity comes in at t@xmath49=33k .",
    "the existence of a ferromagnetic component in the superconducting state of this sample suggested by the low frequency data here presented , is also supported by magnetic measurements performed on the same sample and reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "moreover , because no impurity lines were detected in the x - ray diffraction pattern within the experimental resolution we may argue that no extra phases are responsible for ferromagnetism implying that this ordering is due to an intrinsic phase and in this respect we could infer that the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is realized within a microscopic scale .",
    "this hypothesis is corroborated by magneto - optical - imaging measurements where ferromagnetism and superconductivity are directly observed to coexist in the same space within the experimental resolution@xcite .",
    "second , we speculate briefly on the significance of the phenomenological model previously introduced . within our model , we assume that the measured total voltage is the sum of two contributions : one coming from the superconducting channel and the other due to the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "although the crudeness of the assumptions , we have been able to reproduce fairly the shape of the @xmath16 curves and more importantly we clearly identify the superconducting contribution only when the ferromagnetic one is subtracted .",
    "this contribution is of the standard form for a generic superconductor and this in turn further supports the correctness of our assumptions .",
    "in conclusion , we performed measurements on gdsr@xmath11rucu@xmath11o@xmath12 ruthenate - cuprate with the aim to address the question of the nature of the magnetic order in the superconducting phase and trying to improve the understanding of the physics of ruthenate - cuprate materials .",
    "we used a relatively inexplored approach , based on the analysis of low frequency electrical transport measurements .",
    "the observed current - voltage curves have been found in quite good qualitative agreement with the predictions of a phenomenological model accounting for coexistence of both magnetic and superconducting phases in the sample .",
    "our experimental results suggest that gdsr@xmath11rucu@xmath11o@xmath12 is paramagnetic above @xmath2=133  k , ferromagnetic between @xmath3=18  k and @xmath2=133  k , and both ferromagnetic and superconducting below @xmath3=18  k.",
