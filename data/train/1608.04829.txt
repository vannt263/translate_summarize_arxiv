    "measurement - based quantum computing  @xcite allows universal quantum computing only with adaptive single - qubit measurements on a certain entangled state such as the graph state .",

    "it was also shown that the quantum state distinguishability , which is a qszk - complete problem , and the quantum circuit distinguishability , which is a qip - complete problem , can be solved with the verifier who can do only single - qubit measurements  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in these results is the verification of the graph state : prover(s ) generate the graph state , and the verifier performs measurement - based quantum computing on it . by checking the stabilizer operators",
    ", the verifier can also verify the correctness of the graph state .",

    "@xcite to construct multiprover interactive proof systems for local hamiltonian problems .    what happens if in qma the quantum channel between merlin and arthur is noisy ?",
    "the first result of the present paper is that such a modification does not change the computational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are correctable with high probability .",
    "the proof is simple : merlin encodes the witness state with a quantum error - correcting code , and sends it to arthur who can correct channel error by doing the quantum error correction .",
    "the problem becomes more nontrivial if we further assume that arthur can do only single - qubit measurements , since in this case arthur can not do the universal quantum computation by himself .",
    "the second result of the present paper is that the noisy qma with such an additional restriction for arthur is still equivalent to qma . to show it , we use measurement - based quantum computing :",
    "honest merlin sends the graph state to arthur , and arthur does fault - tolerant measurement - based quantum computing on it with only single - qubit measurements . by measuring stabilizer operators",
    ", arthur also checks the correctness of the graph state .",
    "note that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite can not be directly applied to the present case , since the stabilizer test used in these results is so strict that even honest merlin is rejected with high probability if the channel is noisy : even if honest merlin sends the ideal graph state , the state is changed due to the noise in the channel , and such a deviated state is rejected with high probability by the stabilizer test in spite that the correct quantum computing is still possible on such a state by correcting errors .",
    "we therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can accept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are error - correctable .",
    "note that recently a similar relaxed stabilizer test was introduced and applied to blind quantum computing in ref .",

    "we can also consider another definition that assumes that even evil merlin can not modify the channel , but in this case we do not know how to show that the class is in qma , and therefore in this paper , we do not consider the definition .",

    "<S> what happens if in qma the quantum channel between merlin and arthur is noisy ? </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the computational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are correctable with high probability , since if merlin encodes the witness state in a quantum error - correction code and sends it to arthur , arthur can correct the error caused by the noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> if we further assume that arthur can do only single - qubit measurements , however , the problem becomes nontrivial , since in this case arthur can not do the universal quantum computation by himself . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent to qma . to show it , we use measurement - based quantum computing : </S>",
    "<S> honest merlin sends the graph state to arthur , and arthur does fault - tolerant measurement - based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only single - qubit measurements . by measuring stabilizer operators </S>",
    "<S> , arthur also checks the correctness of the graph state . </S>",
    "<S> although this idea itself was already used in several previous papers , these results can not be directly used to the present case , since the test that checks the graph state used in these papers is so strict that even honest merlin is rejected with high probability if the channel is noisy . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can accept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are error - correctable . </S>"
