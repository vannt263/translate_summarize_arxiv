    "this continuum data set was then used for the hybrid imaging process , which involves iterative imaging and self - calibration of the antenna - based complex gains ( walker 1985 ) .",
    "the final iteration involved both phase and amplitude calibration with a 3 minute averaging time for phases and 15 minutes for amplitudes .",
    "the self - calibration solutions were applied to the spectral line data set .",

    "the 1.368 ghz continuum image of mrk 273 at 50 mas resolution is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the image shows that the northern nucleus is extended , with a major axis of 0.5@xmath0 and a minor axis of 0.3@xmath0 .",

    "we designate the western peak n1 and the eastern peak n2 .",

    "table 1 lists the positions and surface brightnesses at 10 mas resolution of the six sources with surface brightnesses @xmath8 0.5 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "positions are relative to the peak surface brightness , corresponding to n1 .",
    "the nominal position of n1 in figure 2 is ( j2000 ) : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , based on phase - referencing observations using the celestial calibrator j1337 + 550 with a 5 minute cycle time .",
    "note that the minimum error in the absolute astrometry is 12 mas , as set by the uncertainty in the calibrator source position ( see wilkinson et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the true error after phase transfer is likely to be significantly higher than this ( fomalont 1995 , beasley and conway 1995 ) .    given the incomplete fourier spacing coverage for vlbi imaging , in particular for short spacings , it is possible that the clean algorithm has generated spurious point sources when trying to deconvolve extended emission regions .",
    "conversely , we can not rule - out the possibility that the extended emission is composed of mostly faint point sources .",
    "the use of multiresolution clean mitigates these problems , and the sources listed in table 1 all reproduce with essentially the same surface brightnesses for images made with the clark clean , multi - resolution clean , and for images made with different visibility weighting schemes .",
    "the brightness temperatures of these sources are all @xmath23 k , indicating non - thermal emission .",
    "the southeastern nucleus is also resolved , with high surface brightness emission occuring over a scale of 50 mas .",
    "we set a 4@xmath24 limit of 0.14 mjy to any compact radio source associated with the southwestern peak ( large cross in figure 1 ) seen at near ir wavelengths ( knapen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "spectra of the hi 21 cm absorption toward se , and n1 and n2 , at 50 mas resolution are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the spectrum of se shows a double peaked profile , with the two lines separated by 400 km s@xmath2 , each with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of about 280 km s@xmath2 .",
    "there is marginal evidence that each component has velocity sub - structure , but the snr of these data are insufficient to make a firm conclusion on this point .",
    "the peak optical depth of each line is about 0.12@xmath200.02 , and the implied hi column density in each component is then : n(hi ) = 6.4@xmath201.1 @xmath310@xmath25 @xmath3 @xmath26 @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the hi spin temperature in k.    an interesting comparison is made with the merlin absorption spectra at 0.2@xmath0 resolution toward the se component ( coles et al .",
    "1999 ) . at this resolution",
    ", merlin detects 19 mjy of continuum emission , and shows a 3 mjy absorption line at about 11200 km s@xmath2 , and weaker absorption of about 1 mjy at 11400 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the vlba data show a peak continuum surface brightness of 10 mjy beam@xmath2 at 50 mas resolution , and absorption line depths of 1 mjy at both velocities .",
    "this suggests that the absorption at 11200 km s@xmath2 is due to extended gas covering both the compact and extended continuum emitting regions , while the 11400 km s@xmath2 absorption is due to a small cloud ( @xmath7 40 pc ) covering only the high surface brightness continuum emission . assuming 11200 km s@xmath2 indicates the systemic velocity of the gas at that location in the galaxy disk ( coles et al .",
    "1999 ) , then the higher velocity system would be infalling at 200 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum of n2 shows a relatively narrow absorption line , with a fwhm = 160 km s@xmath2 , a peak optical depth of 0.59@xmath200.06 , and an hi column density of @xmath28 @xmath3 @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the spectrum of n1 shows a broad , flat absorption profile with fwhm = 540 km s@xmath2 , with optical depths ranging from 0.1 and 0.4@xmath200.04 across the line profile .",
    "again , there is marginal evidence for a few narrower , higher optical depth components .",
    "the total hi column density is @xmath29 @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity range of the hi absorption toward n1 is comparable to that seen for the oh megamaser emission ( baan , haschick , and schmeltz 1985 , stavely - smith et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram for the hi 21 cm absorption along the major axis of the northern nucleus . there is a velocity gradient from east to west of about 450 km s@xmath2 across 300 mas , plus an apparent flattening of the velocity distribution to larger radii .",
    "the p - v distribution is confused somewhat by the broad absorption seen toward n1 ( at position 90 mas in figure 4 ) .",
    "the east - west velocity gradient of the hi absorption across the northern source is consistent with results from merlin hi 21 cm imaging at 0.2@xmath0 resolution ( coles et al .",
    "1999 ) , and with the velocity field derived from co emission observations at 0.6@xmath0 resolution ( downes and solomon 1998 ) .",
    "the most significant result from our high resolution radio continuum imaging of mrk 273 is that the emission from the northern nucleus extends over a region of @xmath30 ( 220@xmath3370 pc ) , punctuated by a number of compact sources with flux densities between 0.5 and 3 mjy .",
    "this morphology resembles those of the starburst nuclei of ngc 253 and m82 ( ulvestad and antonnuci 1997 , muxlow et al .",
    "1994 ) , on a similar spatial scale .",
    "however , the total radio luminosity is an order magnitude larger in mrk 273 .",
    "the physical conditions in this region are extreme , with a minimum pressure of 10@xmath31 dynes @xmath27 , and corresponding magnetic fields of 100 @xmath32 g .    the 1.4 ghz radio continuum emission from nuclear starburst galaxies is thought to be primarily synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons spiraling in interstellar magnetic fields , with the electrons being accelerated in supernova remnant shocks ( condon 1992 , duric 1988 ) .",
    "the compact sources are then individual supernovae or supernova remnants , while the diffuse emission is thought to be from electrons that have diffused away from the supernova remnant shocks .",
    "our high resolution images provide strong support for the hypothesis of downes and solomon ( 1998 ) that the northern nucleus of mrk 273 is an extreme compact starburst , with a massive star formation rate of 60 m@xmath5 year@xmath2 , as derived from the radio continuum luminosity ( condon 1992 ) , and occuring in a region of only 370 pc diameter . from their detailed analysis of the co emission from mrk 273 , downes and solomon ( 1998 )",
    "propose that the star formation occurs in a disk with scale height of 21 pc and a total gas mass of @xmath33 m@xmath5 .",
    "the nature of the weak , compact radio continuum sources in mrk 273 is not clear , but given the similarity in morphology with the starburst nuclei in m82 and ngc 253 , it is likely that these sources are a combination of nested supernova remnants and/or luminous radio supernovae .",
    "these sources have radio spectral luminosities",
    "@xmath34 ergs s@xmath2 hz@xmath2 at 1.4 ghz , which is an order of magnitude higher than the brightest radio supernovae remnants seen in m82 ( muxlow et al .",
    "1994 ) , and are comparable in luminousity to the rare class of extreme luminosity radio supernovae characterized by sne 1986j ( rupen et al . 1987 ) and 1979c ( weiler and sramek 1988 ) .",
    "a substantial population of such luminous supernovae has been discovered in the starburst nucleus of arp 220 by smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who suggest that the high luminosities of those supernovae may indicate a denser local environment relative to typical supernovae , by a factor 3 or so ( chevalier 1984 ) .",
    "if the compact sources in mrk 273 are nested supernova remnants , then it would require 10 or more of the most luminous m82-type supernova remnants in regions less than 7 pc in size .",
    "future high resolution imaging of mrk 273 is required to clarify the nature of these compact sources .",
    "it is possible that the brightest of the compact sources , coincident with n1 , indicates the presence of a weak radio agn .",
    "supporting evidence for this conclusion is the broad hi absorption line observed toward n1 .",
    "this component contributes only 3.8@xmath6 to the total radio luminosity at 1.4 ghz of the northern nuclear regions .    from flattening of the radio spectrum between 1.6 and 5 ghz , knapen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that there may be a dominant , synchrotron self - absorbed radio - loud agn in the northern nucleus of mrk 273 .",
    "the images presented herein clearly preclude this hypothesis .",
    "we feel a more likely explanation for the low frequency flattening is free - free absorption .",
    "we are currently analyzing images with sub - arcsecond resolution between 327 mhz and 22 ghz in order to determine the origin of this low frequency flattening .",
    "the gas disk hypothesis for the northern nucleus of mrk 273 is supported by the observed velocity gradient in the hi 21 cm absorption along the major axis .",
    "the rotational velocity at a radius of 220 pc is 280 km s@xmath2 , assuming an inclination angle of 53@xmath1 .",
    "assuming keplerian rotation , the enclosed mass inside this radius is then 2@xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath5 , comparable to the molecular gas mass observed on this scale .",
    "overall , these data support the idea that the dominant energy source in the northern nuclear region in mrk 273 is a starburst and not an agn .",
    "however , the presence of an agn somewhere in the inner 2@xmath0 of mrk 273 is still suggested , based on the high ionization near ir lines ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) , the ( possible ) hard x - ray component ( iwasawa 1999 ) , and the seyfert ii optical spectrum , although condon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) argue that a seyfert ii spectrum is not necessarily a conclusive agn indicator .",
    "it is possible that the agn is located at either the se radio nucleus , or the sw near ir nucleus .",
    "the se radio nucleus presents a number of peculiarities , the most important of which is the weakness of the near ir emission ( knapen et al .",
    "1998 , scoville et al .",
    "knapen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that this source may simply be the chance projection of a background radio source .",
    "however , the probability of a chance projection of a 40 mjy source within 1@xmath0 of the northern nucleus is only @xmath35 ( langston et al .",
    "1990 , richards et al .",
    "this low probability , and the fact that we see evidence for gas infall into the se nucleus in the hi 21 cm absorption images , effectively preclude the background source hypothesis . the radio morphology is consistent with an amorphous jet , or a very compact starburst , although the lack of co emission from this region argues for an agn .",
    "one possible cause for the lack of near ir emission is that the active region is still obscured at 2.2 @xmath32 m .",
    "the hi 21 cm absorption column density is 6.4@xmath201.1 @xmath310@xmath36 @xmath3 ( @xmath37 ) @xmath27 , while the absorption column derived from the hard x - ray spectrum may be as large as @xmath38 @xmath27 , depending on the x - ray powerlaw index . using the hi 21 cm column leads to a@xmath39 = @xmath40 , assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio",
    "this is comparable the extinction responsible for the obscuration in the near ir of the agn in the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a ( ward 1996 ) .",
    "imaging at wavelengths of 10 @xmath32 m or longer , with sub - arcsecond resolution , is required to address this interesting question .",
    "we do not detect any high surface brightness radio emission associated with the sw near ir nucleus .",
    "this could simply mean that this region harbours a radio quiet agn .",
    "an alternative posibility is that this is a star forming region in which the star formation is very recent , commencing less than 10@xmath41 years ago , such that a substantial population of radio supernovae and supernova remnants have not yet had time to develop .",
