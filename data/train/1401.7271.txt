    "rrlyrae - type stars with the period ratio of 0.600.64 are yet another class of pulsators in which period doubling can occur .",
    "we recall , that this phenomenon has recently been discovered in two other classes of pulsating variables  in blazhko rrab stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* szab et al . 2010 ) ) and in the blherculis - type stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smolec et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "its origin can be traced to a half - integer resonance between the pulsation modes ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "with the benefit of high quality _ kepler _ data it is possible to search for modes which are even weaker than @xmath20 and its subharmonic peaks . such modes are discovered in three _ kepler _ rrc variables ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moskalik et al .",
    "all but one of these oscillations have amplitudes below 0.4mmag .",
    "the majority of them generate combination peaks with the dominant radial pulsation ( @xmath19 ) , which proves that they indeed originate in the rrc star and do not come from blending with another variable .",
    "the richest harvest of low amplitude modes is found in kic5520878 , where 15 such oscillations are detected .",
    "based on the period ratios , one of these modes can be identified with the second radial overtone , but all others must be nonradial .",
    "interestingly , several modes have frequencies significantly lower than the radial fundamental mode ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "this implies that these nonradial oscillations are not @xmath27-modes , but must be of either gravity or mixed mode character .",
    "low frequency modes of this type are discovered also in the other two rrc stars .    , @xmath20 , their harmonics , subharmonics and 5 highest combination peaks .",

    "they are listed in table[tab3 ] . for each secondary mode , instead of its period , we provide the period ratio of this mode and the dominant fundamental radial pulsation , @xmath34 .",
    "the period ratios given in the column 4 of the table are clearly incompatible with those of the radial modes .",
    "therefore , these secondary oscillations must be nonradial .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated for modes listed in column 3 .",
    "their period ratios are more or less similar to that observed in the rrd stars . on this ground , the secondary modes of column 3 are usually identified with the radial first overtone . however , the double - mode rrlyrae - type stars do not populate the @xmath34 vs. @xmath7 diagram in a random way .",
    "instead , they form a rather narrow ,",
    "well defined sequence on this diagram ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* soszyski et al . 2009 ) , @xcite ) . putting this differently",
    ", there is an empirical relation between the period ratio and the period .",
    "it is easy to check that v1127aql is the only variable of table[tab3 ] which follows this relation .",
    "for all the remaining variables , the secondary modes listed in column 3 deviate considerably from the empirical trend .",
    "therefore , identification of these modes with the radial first overtone should be treated with great caution .",
    "these periodicities most likely correspond to nonradial modes , the frequencies of which are just close to that of the radial overtone .",
    "we note , that a small number of similar outliers from the empirical @xmath34 vs. @xmath7 relation have also been identified in the lmc and in the galactic bulge ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* soszyski et al . 2009 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "the secondary periods in those objects might correspond to nonradial modes , too .",
    "the tendency of nonradial oscillations to appear preferentially around the frequency of the radial overtone is not a surprise .",
    "in fact , it is consistent with the theory .",
    "linear nonadiabatic calculations show that nonradial modes can be excited in the rrlyrae - type stars , and their growth rates are highest in the vicinity of the radial modes ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the growth rates reach maximum values at frequencies slightly above that of the radial mode .",
    "this is true both for modes of @xmath35 and for the strongly trapped modes ( stu modes ) of higher spherical degrees .",
    "thus , nonradial oscillations which are most likely to be excited should yield period ratios somewhat lower than the radial first overtone .",
