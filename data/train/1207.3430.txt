    "many of the qualitative and quantitative predictions of the @xmath3 expansion method @xcite , where @xmath0 is the number of colors , have been proved 0 when compared to experimental results of ground state baryons @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the observation that , for @xmath4 flavors , the ground state baryons display an exact contracted su(2@xmath4 ) symmetry when @xmath5 . at large , but",
    "finite @xmath0 , this symmetry is broken by contributions of order of @xmath3 , leading to mass splittings .",
    "subsequently , efforts have been made to extend the method to excited states .",
    "there are two complementary pictures of large @xmath0 for baryon resonances .",
    "one is the so - called _ quark - shell picture _ where the symmetry is extended to su(2@xmath4 ) @xmath6 o(3 ) , which allows to classify baryons in excitation bands @xmath7 @xcite , like in the quark model where @xmath0 = 3 @xcite .",
    "the other is the _ resonance or scattering picture _ derived from symmetry features of chiral soliton models .",
    "the role of large @xmath0 qcd is to relate the scattering amplitudes in various channels with @xmath8-amplitudes , where @xmath8 is the grand spin @xmath9 .",
    "these are linear relations in the meson - nucleon scattering amplitudes from which one can infer some patterns of degeneracy among resonances .",
    "naturally , there has been concern about the compatibility of the two pictures . simultaneously cohen and lebed @xcite and pirjol and",
    "schat @xcite studied the @xmath7 = 1 band which represents the lowest @xmath10 $ ] multiplet and found the same three sets of degenerate states as in the _ resonance or scattering picture_. in both studies there were three leading order operators in the mass formula , @xmath11 of order @xmath12 together with @xmath13 and @xmath14 having matrix elements of order @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , pirjol and schat showed that the three sets of degenerate states correspond to irreducible representations of the contracted su(4)@xmath15 symmetry , the three sets being called three towers of states .",
    "moreover , to the three leading order operators in the mass formula they added @xmath3 corrections and reanalyzed the mass spectrum of the lowest negative parity nonstrange baryons .",
    "they found ambiguities in the identification of physical states with @xmath0 = 3 with the degenerate large @xmath0 tower states .",
    "actually , in the su(4 ) case the degeneracy of sets of states corresponding to irreducible representations of the contracted su(4)@xmath15 symmetry was first discussed by pirjol and yan in ref .",
    "@xcite .    later on ,",
    "the compatibility between the two pictures was discussed on a general basis again by cohen and lebed @xcite .",
    "the compatibility was claimed for completely symmetric ( s ) , mixed symmetric ( ms ) and completely antisymmetric ( a ) states of @xmath0 quarks having angular momentum up to @xmath16 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we gave an explicit proof of the degeneracy of mass eigenvalues in the quark - shell picture for @xmath16 .",
    "we thus supported the idea of full compatibility of ref .",
    "@xcite for higher parts of the spectrum .",
    "this compatibility means that any complete spin - flavor multiplet within one picture fills the quantum numbers of the other picture .",
    "in addition , we could prove that the quark - shell picture is richer in information , by making a clear distinction between degenerate sets of states of different values of the angular momentum but associated to the same grand spin @xmath8 .",
    "for example , one can associate a common @xmath8 = 2 to both @xmath1 = 1 and @xmath1 = 3 .",
    "a similar situation appears for every @xmath8 value associated to two distinct values of @xmath1 satisfying the @xmath17 rule @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the above studies were based on the procedure to consider an excited state as a single quark excitation about a ground state symmetric core @xcite .",
    "in fact the operators mentioned above follow the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite , namely lower case indicates operators acting on the excited quark and the subscript @xmath18 is attached to those acting on the symmetric core .",
    "the symmetric core + excited quark was originally proposed @xcite as an extension of the ground state treatment to excited states and was inspired by the hartree picture . in this way , in the flavor - spin space , the problem was reduced to the knowledge of matrix elements of the su(2n@xmath19 ) generators between symmetric states , already known from the ground state studies . accordingly",
    ", the wave function was approximately given by the coupling of an excited quark to a ground state core of @xmath20 quarks , without performing antisymmetrisation . 0",
    "the symmetric core + an excited quark approach was supported by pirjol and schat @xcite within a general large @xmath0 constituent quark model hamiltonian starting from an exact wave function .",
    "a practical problem is that the number of operators entering the mass formula is exceedingly large .",
    "for example , for the @xmath10 $ ] multiplet in su(4 ) there are 12 linearly independent operators in powers of @xmath3 included , while in the @xmath7 = 1 band there are seven experimentally known resonances + two mixing angles .",
    "it is therefore difficult , if not impossible , to find out the most dominant operators .",
    "in addition the symmetric core always has equal spin and isospin , therefore some information is lost regarding the baryons structure .    as an alternative , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed a method where all identical quarks are treated on the same footing and we have an exact wave function in the orbital - flavor - spin space .",
    "the procedure has been 0 applied to the @xmath7 = 1 band @xcite and recently to the @xmath7 = 3 band @xcite , where data are very scarce .",
    "we found out that the most dominant operators of order @xmath3 were both the spin and flavor , the latter being neglected in all studies based on the symmetric core + an excited quark approach .",
    "they are @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] respectively , where the latter is compatible both with su(4 ) and su(6 ) @xcite .",
    "the generators @xmath23 and @xmath24 act on the whole system .",
    "it is precisely in our approach that we wish to analyze the compatibility of the _ quark - shell picture _ and of the _ resonance or scattering picture_. it will be shown that the present results are as simple as those of the symmetric core + an excited quark approach .",
    "it is remarkable that in the _ quark - shell picture _ described below the hamiltonian eigenvalues are linear analytic functions of the dynamical coefficients @xmath25 entering the hamiltonian , like in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    "one can easily identify the three sets of degenerate states which are identical in the quantum numbers with those of the _ resonance or scattering picture _ and those of refs .",
    "the compatibility is therefore confirmed and this gives strong support to our procedure .",
    "in the quark - shell picture the leading - order hamiltonian corresponding to the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite has the following form @xmath26 where the operators presently under consideration are @xmath27 in the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite for the operators @xmath28 .",
    "the first two terms are identical to those of refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of the first term are @xmath0 on all baryons and the second term is a one - body operator defined in the spirit of the hartree picture @xcite and its matrix elements are of order @xmath2 . the third term is new and consistent with our procedure described in the introduction .",
    "it is a two - body operator but has matrix elements of order @xmath2 .",
    "it contains the tensor @xmath29 of so(3 ) defined as @xmath30 which acts on the orbital wave function of the whole system of @xmath0 quarks and is normalized as in ref .",
    "note that when the angular momentum acts on the whole system we use capital @xmath31 to distinguish it from @xmath32 , in the spin - orbit operator , which acts on a single quark . in our approach @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the only operators of order @xmath2 .",
    "the neglect of @xmath3 corrections in the @xmath3 expansion makes sense for the comparison with the scattering picture in the large @xmath0 limit , as already discussed in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ toy ] ) is diagonalized in the bases described below .",
    "we have the following @xmath35 $ ] spin - flavor ( @xmath36 ) states which form a symmetric state with the orbital @xmath1 = 1 state of partition @xmath37 $ ] as well    @xmath38_{sf } = \\left[\\frac{n_c+1}{2 } , \\frac{n_c - 1}{2}\\right]_{s } \\times    \\left[\\frac{n_c+1}{2 } , \\frac{n_c - 1}{2}\\right]_{f},\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42_{sf } = \\left[\\frac{n_c+3}{2 } , \\frac{n_c - 3}{2}\\right]_{s } \\times    \\left[\\frac{n_c+1}{2 } , \\frac{n_c - 1}{2}\\right]_{f},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "the first state belongs to the @xmath61 multiplet .",
    "the other two types of states do not appear in the real world with @xmath60 .",
    "as above , it is easy to find out the size of the matrix of a fixed @xmath45 .",
    "for example for @xmath41 we have a 3 @xmath6 3 matrix defined in the space of all @xmath48 states .",

    "details of the calculation of the matrix elements are given in appendix a.    to obtain the matrices to be diagonalized we have to take the limit @xmath5 in the matrix elements of @xmath33 and @xmath34 given in tables [ matrix ] and [ off - diag ] .",

    "accordingly the following sets of degenerate negative parity multiplets were found for @xmath1 = 1 orbital excitations @xmath69",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71 where , on the right side we indicate the mass of each degenerate set .",
    "these degenerate multiplets are identical to those found in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the masses @xmath72 of eqs . ( [ m0])-([m2 ] )",

    "other choices within the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite would lead to the inclusion of @xmath3 corrections which will necessarily imply numerical calculations .",
    "another remarkable aspect of the present study concerns the mixing angles . for those sectors for which large @xmath0 and @xmath0 = 3 have the same number of quark model states , which , in particular is the nucleon case with @xmath45 = 1/2 and @xmath45 = 3/2 , see eqs .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) , the mixing angles are identical to those obtained by cohen and lebed @xcite or pirjol and schat @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath74 and @xmath75 and amounts to @xmath76 = 0.96 rad and @xmath77 = 2.72 rad respectively ( for details see 0 b ) .",
    "the mixing angles determined from fits to @xmath78 strong decays and 1 data are @xmath79 rad and @xmath80 rad , respectively @xcite .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath81 states the agreement with the phenomenological value is nearly achieved at order @xmath2 but for @xmath82 states corrections of order @xmath83 are necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite the comparison has been made with the decay data of ref .",
    "@xcite , from where it has been extracted @xmath76 = 0.56 rad .    for the other mixing angles resulting from @xmath46 matrices we find @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these give the same absolute values for the mixing angle as those of cohen and lebed @xcite but of opposite signs .",
    "it may be a matter of phase convention .",
    "we also have to compare these results with those of the meson - nucleon scattering picture , where linear relations between matrix elements @xmath86 and @xmath87 of @xmath88 and @xmath89 scattering off a ground state baryon in terms of @xmath8-amplitudes were derived .",
    "they are given by the following equations @xmath90 and @xmath91 in terms of the reduced amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",

    "these relations are exact in large @xmath0 qcd and are independent of any model assumption .",
    "the explicit form of these equations can be found in table i of ref .",
    "that table infers a pattern of degeneracy identical to that presented in eqs .",

    "@xcite ) . in the resonance picture",
    "the degenerate towers of states ( [ k0])-([k2 ] ) correspond to the grand spin @xmath8 = 0,1 and 2 respectively .",
    "therefore the triangular rule proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is satisfied .",
    "the compatibility between the quark - shell picture of the @xmath3 expansion method and the meson - nucleon resonance picture has been previously analyzed @xcite by starting from a hamiltonian containing operators of order @xmath2 defined in the symmetric core + an excited quark method @xcite and full compatibility has been found .",
    "here we have used an alternative description of the mixed symmetric states where the separation of su(6 ) generators into two terms , one acting on the core and the other on the excited quark , is avoided and the orbital - flavor - spin wave function is exactly symmetric under the permutation group @xcite , as it should be for identical quarks .",
    "interestingly we found an identical pattern of degeneracy in the quantum numbers with that obtained from the symmetric core + an excited quark method , thus have proven that the full compatibility holds in this procedure as well .",
    "this supports once more the method we have proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite where a good fit to the experiment has been found for the @xmath7=1 band , and more recently for mixed symmetric multiplets in the @xmath7=3 band @xcite .",
    "the importance of the compatibility of the two pictures has been clearly pointed out in ref .",
