    "the attractive possibility that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe was created at the electroweak phase transition has deserved a lot of of attention in the last years @xcite .",
    "it was realized @xcite that all the conditions formulated by sakharov @xcite ( for generating the baryon asymmetry ) can be met in the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , the sphaleron transitions were recognized as unsupressed at high temperatures and so playing a central role in the mechanisms generating the amount of @xmath0 we finally observe today .",
    "these sphaleron processes , if unsupressed after the electroweak phase transition , will drive the previously created baryon asymmetry to zero , and so its rate @xmath1 at that time @xcite ( @xmath2 ) should be less than the hubble expansion rate @xmath3 to go out of equilibrium . due to the exponential sensitivity of @xmath1 to the ratio @xmath4 , imposing @xmath5 gives the model independent condition @xcite : [ central ] 45 .    after relating the sphaleron energy @xcite @xmath6 to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field at the critical temperature @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the central relation eq .",
    "( [ central ] ) translates into [ strong ] 1 , which tells that the transition should be strongly enough first order so as to avoid the erasure of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "when the dependence of @xmath9 on the parameters of the higgs potential is taken into account , condition ( 2 ) gives an upper bound on the mass of the higgs boson ( in the standard model where this calculation was originally performed and also in more general cases ) .",
    "the study of this bound is the central aim of the work here resumed .    all along this paper",
    "we will say that a phase transition is strongly first order if condition ( [ strong ] ) is satisfied and weakly first order ( or even second order ) if it is not .",
    "the effective potential at non zero temperature is the central tool in studying the electroweak phase transition . in one - loop approximation",
    "the temperature - dependent potential describes a first order phase transition between the symmetric phase ( at high t ) and the @xmath10 breaking one . using a high temperature expansion",
    "the form of the potential is : v(,t)=d(t^2-t_0 ^ 2)^2-e t^3+(t)^4 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are easily calculable .    approximating the critical temperature @xmath7 as the temperature @xmath13 at which two degenerate minima coexist ( @xmath7 will be somewhere in the narrow range between @xmath13 and the temperature @xmath14 at which the minimum at @xmath15 is destabilized ) one gets [ main ] = .",
    "we see from this formula that the strenght of the transition is governed by @xmath16 ( which gives the cubic term in the potential ) .",
    "now , @xmath16 comes from bosonic loops only ( from @xmath17 matsubara frecuencies ) .",
    "each bosonic degree of freedom , with field dependent mass @xmath18 contributes to the potential a term _",
    "i v = -^3/2 . in the sm ,",
    "the main contribution is the one coming from gauge boson loops : [ gb ] v = - . using the value of @xmath16 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ gb ] ) and relating @xmath19 to the higgs mass one gets the bound @xcite m_h(45 - 50 )  gev , region which is already ruled out by lep .",
    "this bound is obtained within the one - loop approximation to the effective potential and as is well known this will only be reliable for @xmath20 ( the expansion parameter is @xmath21 ) . for small @xmath22 the perturbative expansion",
    "is plagued with infrared divergences . to cure this",
    ", one has to reorganize the loop expansion resumming the most important infrared divergent diagrams @xcite ( the so called daisy diagrams ) .",
    "the effect of this daisy resummation is to shift the mass of the @xmath17 modes contributing to the cubic term by a thermal mass ( debye screening effect ) . in the sm",
    "this thermal mass is of order @xmath23 to leading order for the longitudinal gauge bosons , and zero ( to this order ) for the transverse ones .",
    "the effect of this thermal mass is to shield the cubic term of the longitudinal modes while leaving the transverse modes unaffected and so to effectively reduce @xmath16 by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "the improved bound on the higgs mass is then even lower @xcite : m_h ( 45 - 50 )  gev~(35 - 40 )  gev .",
    "there exist further refinements of this calculation in the literature .",
    "if the screening of the transverse modes at subleading order @xmath25 is taken into account @xcite the strenght of the transition is further reduced . on the other hand , some non - perturbative effects may give a lower value for the critical temperature @xcite translating into a larger ratio @xmath26 .",
    "also there are some two - loop ( resummed ) calculations @xcite that give larger @xmath9 .    even with these uncertainties",
    "the sm has another problems to be able to generate the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "in fact the @xmath27 violation effects are by far too small to give the correct amount of @xmath0 and some recent atempts @xcite to solve this problem have been shown @xcite to be flawn .",
    "so it seems necessary to move to some extensions of the sm to explain the generation of the baryon asymmetry at the electroweak phase transition .    from what we have learned by studying the standard model case we can work out an estrategy @xcite for the extensions of it to give a strong first order phase transition .",
    "a look at eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) shows that we need a large cubic term in our potential .",
    "so , adding more bosonic degrees of freedom may help for only bosons contribute to this cubic term .",
    "the screened mass of such bosons will have the general form [ genmass ] ^2 ( ) = m^2 + ^2 + ( t ) , where @xmath28 is an invariant mass , @xmath19 is a generic coupling of the new bosons to the higgs ( here @xmath22 stands generically for the fields driving the transition ) and @xmath29 is the thermal mass . for this to give a non - negligible contribution to the cubic term",
    ", small values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and large values of @xmath19 are required .",
    "usually , there will exist an experimental lower bound for @xmath28 so that one can not take it to be arbitrarily small .",
    "concerning the coupling @xmath19 the requirement of perturbativity up to some large scale will set an upper bound on it . in a given model one",
    "has to take all this conditions into account when looking for a region in the parameter space where the phase transition is strong enough .    another way of increasing the strenght of the transition has been considered in the literature @xcite , namely the possibility of decreasing the value of the coupling in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) due to one loop corrections ( even at zero temperature ) .",
    "but usually for this mechanism to give a sizeable effect large couplings and/or many bosonic degrees of freedom are needed .    before moving to the discussion of extended models some words about the validity of the perturbative calculations are needed .",
    "roughly speaking , one can trust the ( resummed ) perturbative calculations in the sm if @xmath30 ( or equivalently @xmath31 ) . when trying to improve the `` sphaleron bound '' @xmath32 , one can face cases where @xmath33 rising some doubts about the reliability of the calculation of @xmath34 . in the cases we are going to consider",
    "the relevant parameter will no longer be @xmath35 .",
    "in fact @xmath36 will be substituted by @xmath37 in the sm + singlet case and by @xmath38 in the mssm . as we will be interested in large values of these couplings , for a given higgs mass the expansion parameter will be smaller than in the sm , and the perturbative calculation more reliable .",
