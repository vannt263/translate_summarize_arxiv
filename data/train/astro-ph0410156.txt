    "in a series of papers since 2003 , we have reported results of a program to search for intra - night optical variability ( inov ; see wagner & witzel 1995 for a review ) , often called microvariability , in a sample of 26 optically luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , using the 104-cm zeiss telescope of the aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences ( aries ) , naini tal , india ( gopal - krishna et al . 2003 , gk03 ; stalin et al .",

    "; see also stalin 2003 ) .",
    "these objects belong to the four major classes of luminous agn , namely , radio - quiet qsos ( rqqs ) , radio - loud lobe - dominated quasars ( ldqs ) , radio - loud core - dominated quasars ( cdqs ) , and bl lac objects ( bls ) .",
    "the sample selection was such that the four classes are reasonably well matched in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , with @xmath0 ranging from 0.17 to 2.2 and @xmath1 ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( taking @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    ".the sample of 20 optically luminous agn monitored in the present work [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , > , > \" , ]     @xmath7references for optical polarizations : wills et al .  1992 ; impey &    tapia 1988 ; marcha et al .  1996 ;",

    "* distributions of inov amplitude ( @xmath11 ) , for 39 light - curves of the 6 egret ( hatched ) and 12 light - curves of the 6 non - egret ( black ) bls .",
    "we have presented new observations of intra - night optical monitoring for 20 powerful agn , including 3 bl lacs , 5 radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and 12 radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) .",
    "inov is detected in all three classes of agn , consistent with the results reported in our earlier papers ( gk03 ; st04a , b ; sa04 ) . by combining the present data with the observations reported in our earlier papers ( gk03 ; st04a ; sa04 ) , we could assemble a larger agn sample consisting of 19 rqqs , 9 bl lacs and 16 rlqs ( after excluding the high optical polarization quasar 1216@xmath12010 from the radio core - dominated rlqs in our sample ) .",
    "the inov duty cycles ( dcs ) derived for this sample are : 63% for bl lacs , 18% for rlqs and 22% for rqqs .",
    "thus , the inov duty cycles for both rqqs and rlqs ( 5 of which are cdqs ) are similar , and much smaller than that for bl lacs .",
    "this supports our earlier result that the mere presence of a powerful radio synchrotron jet does not lead to an enhanced inov ( gk03 ; st04a ) .",
    "the observed similarity in the inov of rqqs and non - blazar rlqs , both in terms of dc and @xmath11 , further suggests that the rqqs also eject relativistic jets .",
    "their jets are , however , probably quenched while crossing the innermost micro - arcsecond scale , possibly through heavy inverse compton losses in the vicinity of the central engine ( gk03 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion has also been reported recently from radio variability studies of rlqs and rqqs ( barvainis et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "further , we have formed an enlarged sample of bl lac objects with intra - night monitoring duration @xmath13 4 hours , by combining the 3 lcs reported here with 48 taken from the literature ( sect .",
    "the duty cycle of inov for this entire sample of 51 lcs of bl lacs is found to be 68% .    dividing this sample of 51 lcs by the criterion of detection of @xmath14rays ( table 4 )",
    ", we find that the @xmath14ray detected bls show somewhat stronger inov , the formal confidence being 0.962 using k - s test ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "it is tempting to speculate about the possible origin of this difference .",
    "the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model for the origin of @xmath14rays posits that the @xmath14rays are produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the synchrotron photons themselves off the relativistic jet electrons ( e.g.  maraschi , ghisellini & celloti 1992 ; bloom & marscher 1996 ) .",
    "the external compton ( ec ) models invoke ic scattering of photons originating outside the jet , typically from the accretion disk around the central black hole ( e.g.  dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis 1992 ) , or disk photons reprocessed by matter above the disk but outside the jet ( e.g. sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ; blandford & levinson 1995 ) . a variant of the ec model , the `` mirror model '' , utilizes jet photons reflected or reprocessed by clouds external to the jet ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .    in the ic scenario involving external seed photons for @xmath15ray loud blazars ,",
    "one expects the emission cone to be particularly sharp ( dermer 1995 ) , raising the likelihood of detecting stronger and more rapid inov ( gk03 ) .",
    "hence , our current preliminary results provide additional support to the ec model .",
    "nonetheless , more extensive , multi - band intra - night monitoring observations of blazars are clearly needed . for the non - blazar agn",
    ", the amplitude of inov continues to be found to be small ( @xmath16 3% ) , emphasizing the need for even more sensitive monitoring programs .",
