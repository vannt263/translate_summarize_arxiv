    "the discovery of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson  @xcite has further strengthened the belief for a weakly - coupled higgs sector with supersymmetry ( susy ) as the most compelling realization .",
    "if the weak - scale susy is realized in nature  @xcite , the definitive confirmation will require the discovery of the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak ( ew ) particles in the sm , in particular the gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "we refer to them as electroweakinos ( ewkinos ) throughout this document .    given the current results on susy searches at the lhc @xcite",
    ", the absence of the spectacular events of large hadronic activities plus substantial missing energy implies a lower mass bound for the gluino and light squarks at about a tev or heavier . in anticipation of much heavier colored susy partners ,",
    "we are thus led to consider a more challenging search strategy , namely the susy signals only from the ew sector , the charginos and neutralinos .",
    "unfortunately , the direct production of electroweakinos at the lhc suffers from relatively small rates @xcite .",
    "the current direct search bounds at the lhc are thus rather weak  @xcite and the future perspectives for the mass parameter coverage are limited   @xcite .",
    "a further complication is that some dark matter consideration favors a situation for nearly - degenerate charginos and neutralinos  @xcite , making their identification more challenging  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a lepton collider will provide a rather clean environment for new physics discovery , as long as the collider achieves higher enough luminosity and the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy crosses the new physics threshold .",
    "we are thus motivated to assess the sensitivity for observing the electroweakinos at the lhc and to compare with the reach at an ilc with a cm energy of 500 gev .",
    "the most relevant soft susy - breaking mass parameters for the bino , wino , and higgsino are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we take a model - independent approach and study the susy signals with all possible relative values of these three susy - breaking mass parameters , which lead to six cases in the most general terms @xcite . among them",
    ", four cases would naturally result in a compressed spectrum of nearly degenerate lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsps ) . beyond the existing literature for studying the production and decay of the charginos and neutralinos",
    ", we also put a special emphasis on the by - now established channels from the decays of a 125 gev higgs boson @xmath10 .",
    "we find that with 300 fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity at the 14 tev lhc , it is promising to reach up to an electroweakino mass about 400 gev ( 250 gev ) for a @xmath1 c.l .",
    "exclusion ( 5@xmath2 discovery ) , and the signal with @xmath11 can be identified . at the ilc ,",
    "once the mass threshold is reached for the gaugino pair production , the signal of charginos and neutralinos may be separated with @xmath12 measurements for the mass resolution and the couplings .",
    "we focus on an essential ew sector , namely , the gauginos and higginos as the interaction eigenstates . without assumptions for a susy - breaking mediation scenario , we consider the other susy particles , namely , gluinos , squarks and sleptons , as well as heavy higgs bosons , to decouple from the spectrum .",
    "we explicitly incorporate a sm - like higgs boson of mass : @xmath13 .",
    "there are only four parameters involved in the electroweakino mass matrices , two soft susy breaking mass parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the higgs field mixing parameter @xmath9 , and the electroweak symmetry breaking parameter @xmath16 .",
    "diagonalization of the mass matrices gives the mass eigenstates ( with increasing mass eigenvalues ) , namely , the majorana fermions neutralinos @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , and the dirac fermions charginos @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .    for our phenomenological considerations ,",
    "we adopt the parameters in the broad range @xmath21 note that in the case of bino - like lsp , @xmath14 could be much lower given the lack of model - independent limit on the bino mass .",
