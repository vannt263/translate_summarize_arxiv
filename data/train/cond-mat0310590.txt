    "in addition to the ring - exchange term , a further possible section of this general parameter space is given by the composite - spin representation of a @xmath13 bilinear - biquadratic chain,@xcite which corresponds to the choice of equal leg - leg and diagonal - diagonal couplings .",
    "for this specific choice there is an explicit mapping between the spin-1/2 ladder model and the spin-1 chain .",

    "a renormalization - group ( rg ) procedure constructed on this basis of these perturbations may then be used to establish which fixed points are stable , and to determine the connectivity , the flow structure and thus the physical properties of different regimes of the phase diagram .",
    "an exact description of the gapped phases is possible by using the idea of `` words '' on the plaquette algebra to construct variational ground states .",
    "the direct relation of this concept to the matrix - product ansatz@xcite allows one to obtain both the exact ground state in suitable parameter regimes and the lowest excited states , from which the lines of phase transitions may also be deduced . for parameter regimes in the vicinity of these exact , gapped solutions , the absence of phase transitions means that many qualitative properties of the associated , gapped phases are known .    throughout this study",

    "although we have not obtained specific information concerning this region of the phase diagram , the properties of the regions to which it is connected continuously allow us to deduce that the vector - chirality phase should be separated from the ferromagnetic phase by first - order transitions to a form of aklt state , which indeed exhibits the collinear - spin property found by dmrg . because our considerations do not include negative values of @xmath11 , we refrain from comment on the third and fourth quadrants of the circular phase diagram .    finally , we summarize briefly the relevance of our results for the materials and higher - dimensional systems mentioned in sec .",

    "one expects that a larger value of @xmath11 would be required to find analogs of the more exotic ( i.e. chiral ) phases of the model , and thus that these would most likely be detectable , if at all , as excitations .",
    "films of @xmath1he have been found to offer larger values of @xmath11 , but these appear both in combination with other multiple - spin exchange processes and on a more complex lattice geometry which may lead to further topological possibilities for spin configurations .",
    "our results suggest that this restricted - geometry system may provide a very rich spectrum of possible phases , but a considerably more specific analysis would be required .    in conclusion , we have analyzed a general model for a @xmath12 = 1/2 ladder with ring - exchange interactions . by investigating the exactly soluble points within the parameter space we obtain a complete classification of the phases and phase transitions in this type of system .",
    "although we have considered the minimal model possessing both cyclic four - spin interactions and non - trivial exact solutions , we find a rich variety of gapped and gapless phases , of first- and second order - transitions , and of commensurate and incommensurate excitations , all connected by a complex renormalization - group flow pattern .",
    "the full phase diagram provides significant additional insight into the types of phases and transitions arising in low - dimensional spin systems as a consequence of the cooperation and competition between nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and multiple - spin interactions of the ring - exchange type .",
