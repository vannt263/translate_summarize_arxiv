    "shortly after jones introduced his polynomial invariant of knots in @xcite , kauffman described the jones polynomial in the following way @xcite .",
    "first , a three - variable bracket polynomial for link diagrams is defined , using either a state sum or a recursion",
    ". then the variables that appear in the bracket polynomial are evaluated so that the result is invariant under reidemeister moves of the second and third types .",
    "finally , this simplified bracket polynomial is multiplied by an appropriate factor so that the resulting product is invariant under all three types of reidemeister moves .",
    "thistlethwaite @xcite observed that the state sum and recursion used for kauffman s bracket imply that there is a strong connection between the bracket polynomial of a link diagram and the tutte polynomial of a graph associated with a checkerboard coloring of the diagram s complementary regions .",
    "in this paper we present a fundamentally different graph - theoretic approach to knot - theoretic ideas related to the jones polynomial .",
    "we take a moment to outline this approach before beginning a detailed presentation .",
    "first we introduce a new graph invariant , the _ graph bracket polynomial_. if @xmath1 is an @xmath2-vertex graph then @xmath3 $ ] can be described in two different ways .",
    "one description is a sum indexed by the @xmath4 diagonal matrices over @xmath5 ; this sum is a direct extension of a formula for the jones polynomial of a classical knot given in @xcite .",
    "the other description is a recursion involving the local complementation and pivot operations of @xcite .",
    "the interlace polynomials of @xcite can also be defined using either sums of @xmath6 terms involving @xmath4 matrices over @xmath5 or recursions involving the local complementation and pivoting operations , but the graph bracket and interlace polynomials seem to be genuinely different both in definition and in significance .",
    "for instance , sections 5 and 6 of @xcite suggest that the interlace polynomials capture more information about the independent sets of a graph than the graph bracket does ; on the other hand the graph bracket captures more knot - theoretic information than the interlace polynomials do ( see @xcite ) .    just as the kauffman bracket",
    "@xmath7 $ ] of a knot diagram is related to the tutte polynomial through the checkerboard graph , @xmath7 $ ] is related to the graph bracket polynomial through a different construction , a looped version of the intersection graph of the gauss diagram .",
    "the concise term _ gauss graph _ is already in use , so we  refer to this graph as the _ looped interlacement graph _ , @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 is a plane diagram of a classical ( or virtual ) knot then the _ looped interlacement graph _",
    "@xmath8 has a vertex for each ( classical ) crossing in @xmath9 .",
    "two distinct vertices are adjacent in @xmath8 if and only if the corresponding crossings are _ interlaced _ in @xmath10 , i.e. , while tracing @xmath9 ( in either direction ) one encounters first one crossing , then the other , then the first again , and finally the second again .",
    "@xmath8 has a loop at each vertex corresponding to a negative crossing of @xmath9 .",
    "[ h ]    crossings.eps    @xmath8 appeared implicitly in early research regarding the jones polynomial .",
    "lannes @xcite showed that the arf invariant of a classical knot can be obtained from a combinatorial structure that is essentially a loopless version of @xmath8 ; the relationship between the arf invariant and the evaluation @xmath11 was deduced from this result in @xcite .",
    "zulli @xcite showed that kauffman s state sum formula for the jones polynomial of a classical knot can be obtained from the adjacency matrix of @xmath8 ( the _ trip matrix _ of @xmath9 ) , but did not consider the graph @xmath8 ; the jones polynomial of a virtual knot can be obtained from @xmath8 in the same way .",
    "in section 6 we observe that through the looped interlacement graph construction , the reidemeister moves correspond to a family of simple graph - theoretic operations .",
    "consideration of small examples leads one to guess that a graph jones polynomial invariant under the graph reidemeister moves can be obtained from the graph bracket , just as for knots ; this guess is verified using the graph bracket s recursive description . as @xmath8 is defined for virtual knot diagrams , these notions share with virtual knot theory some striking differences from the classical case .",
    "a fundamental difference is the fact that loop - attachment and -removal ( the graph operations that correspond to crossing switches ) do not suffice to reduce an arbitrary graph to a reidemeister equivalent of an edgeless graph ; consequently the graph jones polynomial can not be computed simply by changing loops and performing reidemeister moves in order to produce ungraphs .",
    "we close this introduction with the observation that these results suggest many questions .",
    "how is the graph bracket polynomial of a graph @xmath1 related to the interlace polynomials of @xmath1 ?",
    "are there graph invariants different from the interlace and graph bracket polynomials that are determined by other recursions involving the pivot and local complementation operations ? which invariants of ( classical or virtual ) knots extend to reidemeister equivalence invariants of graphs ? is every graph reidemeister equivalent to the looped interlacement graph of some virtual knot diagram ?",
    "can these notions be extended to links of more than one component ?",
    "definition 1 simply specifies which vertex - pairs are to be adjacent in @xmath8 , and which vertices are to carry loops ; multiple edges do not occur in looped interlacement graphs , and modifying the definition to allow multiple edges would not make looped interlacement graphs more useful .",
    "we assume similarly that all the graphs we consider in this paper have no multiple edges .",
    "the reader who is a stickler for generality may prefer to consider arbitrary ( multi-)graphs , with the understanding that every set of multiple edges is to be grouped together and treated as a unit .",
