    "one of the most interesting consequences of unconventional pairings is the formation of surface andreev bound states ( sabs ) when the pair potential changes sign on the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "the formation of sabs is related with the emergence of a zero bias peak ( zbp ) in the tunnel conductance@xcite .",
    "while conventional @xmath2-wave pairing is robust against non - magnetic impurities@xcite , many unconventional pairings are fragile owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave vector@xcite .",
    "some sabs have a topological origin and would be protected against imperfections or impurities@xcite .",
    "however , impurity scattering reduces or completely suppresses the zbp for many cases , making it difficult to detect unconventional pairing symmetries from conductance measurements only@xcite . to go beyond dc conductance , it is interesting to study the non - equilibrium current fluctuations or shot noise@xcite .",
    "the shot noise reveals the effective charge transferred in a given tunneling process through the noise - current ratio .",
    "for example , the effective charge of a tunnel junction between a normal metal and a superconductor is doubled , revealing the uncorrelated transfer of cooper pairs due to andreev processes@xcite .    in this work",

    "chiral superconductors are currently attracting a lot of attention since their topologically nontrivial edge states , which display a linear dependence on the momentum , are a condensed matter realization of majorana states@xcite . on the other hand , nodal superconductors with a vanishing order parameter feature sabs with a flat dispersion relation at their edges@xcite .",

    "nodal nontrivial superconductors , with @xmath1- , @xmath11- , or @xmath74-wave symmetry , feature a perfect andreev reflection independently of the barrier strength .",
    "since the normal state conductance is reduced by increasing @xmath20 , the normalized tunnel conductance @xmath75 prominently displays a zero - bias peak .    for gapful nontrivial ( chiral ) superconductors , the conductance reduces to a finite value , slightly over @xmath76 for the chiral @xmath3-wave case or comparable to @xmath77 for the rest of chiral pairing states .    for trivial superconductors , both nodal and gapful",

    "the maxima for each pairing occur for different values of the barrier strength .",
    "however , it would be pointless to use this to experimentally identify each symmetry since the barrier @xmath20 is a fitting parameter that accounts for many possible sources of interfacial scattering@xcite .    a more clear distinction between all superconductors is given by the noise - current ratio , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ball_z](c ) , which determines the effective charge transferred at the interface . since nodal nontrivial superconductors are noiseless independently of the barrier strength , their ratio is also zero .",
    "gapped nontrivial ( chiral ) superconductors have an effective charge equal to the electron charge in the tunnel limit@xcite . in this case , the conducting channels are a superposition of modes with a strong andreev reflection amplitude ( i.e. , those with angle of incidence @xmath81 that feature a linear sabs ) and others with strong normal backscattering ( for @xmath82 ) . for trivial superconductors , gapful or nodal , the effective transferred charge approaches @xmath83 in the tunnel regime , indicating the transfer of a cooper pair at the junction .",

    "nodal nontrivial superconductors display a noiseless zero - bias peak and their ratio is zero ;    chiral superconductors feature a conductance of magnitude comparable to the normal state with noise - current ratio @xmath84 ; and    trivial ( gapful and nodal ) superconductors have a suppressed conductance and ratio approaching @xmath85 .",

    "does not have subgap states crucially determines the impact of the impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "for nontrivial superconductors , given a fixed scattering rate @xmath53 , the self - energy @xmath90 diverges in the born limit and is greatly suppressed in the unitary limit . for trivial superconductors",
    "we expect the opposite behavior .    in the following , we set the barrier strength @xmath91 , where the general behavior of trivial and nontrivial unconventional superconducting orders is clearly displayed , and study the effect of scattering by non - magnetic impurities in the superconductor for zero and finite applied bias .          the zero bias transport results , for a tunnel junction with @xmath91 ,",

    "for the moderate impurity scattering rates considered in this work , @xmath1-wave superconductors are immune to the effect of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the ballistic zero - bias noiseless conductance is unaltered in born and unitary limits .",
    "conversely , for @xmath11- and @xmath74-wave cases the zero - bias conductance peak is reduced by the impurity potential .",
    "as the impurity strength is increased , conductance and shot noise tend to the same value , with ratio equal to @xmath84 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the noise power for these superconductors , which is zero in the ballistic limit , develops a maximum as a function of the scattering rate @xmath53 , similarly to the barrier dependence in the ballistic limit for the rest of superconductors .",
    "nodal trivial superconductors , like @xmath9- and @xmath10-wave cases , are also strongly modified by impurities . in the unitary limit ,",

    "the special case of @xmath1-wave pairing can be explained by the emergence of isotropic odd - frequency cooper pairs at the interface@xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous superconducting systems feature an ubiquitous presence of odd - frequency pairing@xcite , where the wave function of cooper pairs is odd under the exchange of the time coordinates of the electrons forming it@xcite . in the ballistic limit",

    "the presence of impurities suppresses all the anisotropic pairing states and only @xmath1-wave order maintains the ballistic result .    finally , chiral superconductors are mostly unaffected by the impurity scattering .",
    "this behavior is clearly shown by the noise - current ratio , which remains almost @xmath84 in both born and unitary limits for several values of the scattering rate . at first sight",
    "this result seems at odds with the fact that nontrivial superconductors should be sensitive to impurity scattering in the born limit .",
    "the main difference is that gapful nontrivial superconductors feature sabs with a linear dispersion relation , instead of flat bands like nodal superconductors .",
    "the resulting angle - averaged green s function at low energies for chiral superconductors is not divergent , since the sabs only contribute for specific values of the angle ( e.g. , for @xmath94 , the chiral @xmath3-wave sabs has a small contribution at @xmath95 ) .",

    "<S> the order parameter of bulk two - dimensional superconductors is classified as _ nodal _ , if it vanishes for a direction in momentum space , or _ </S>",
    "<S> gapful _ if it does not </S>",
    "<S> . each class can be topologically nontrivial if andreev bound states are formed at the edges of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> non - magnetic impurities in the superconductor affect the formation of andreev bound states and can drastically change the tunneling spectra for small voltages . here , we investigate the mean current and its fluctuations for two - dimensional tunnel junctions between a normal - metal and unconventional superconductors by solving the quasi - classical eilenberger equation self - consistently , including the presence of non - magnetic impurities in the superconductor . as the impurity strength increases , we find that superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since    at zero applied bias , the effective transferred charge calculated from the noise - current ratio tends to the electron charge @xmath0 and    for finite bias , the current - voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction .    </S>",
    "<S> there are notable exceptions to this trend . </S>",
    "<S> first , gapful nontrivial ( chiral ) superconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear dispersion relation of their surface andreev bound states . </S>",
    "<S> second , for nodal nontrivial superconductors , only @xmath1-wave pairing is almost immune to the presence of impurities due to the emergence of odd - frequency @xmath2-wave cooper pairs near the interface . owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave vector , </S>",
    "<S> impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the rest of nodal superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> all these behaviors are neatly captured by the noise - current ratio , providing a useful guide to find experimental signatures for unconventional superconductivity . </S>"
