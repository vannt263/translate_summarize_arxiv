    "in his 1981 _ baseball abstract _ @xcite , bill james posed the following problem : suppose two teams @xmath0 and @xmath1 have winning percentages @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , having played equally strong schedules in a game such as baseball where there are no ties . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 play each other , what is the probability @xmath4 that @xmath0 wins ?",
    "this question is perhaps more relevant to other sports , because in baseball the outcome is particularly sensitive to the pitching matchup .",
    "( in 1972 , the philadelphia phillies won 29 of the 41 games started by steve carlton , and 30 of the 115 games started by their other pitchers . )",
    "the answer is quite interesting , even if its applicability is somewhat limited by the tacit assumption of uniformity .    for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "define @xmath7 by @xmath8 james calls @xmath9 the log5 of @xmath2 , and does not consider any other values of @xmath10 . under the assumption of uniformity , he claims that @xmath4 would be given by the function @xmath11 in this context , we take uniformity to mean that a team s likelihood of defeating another team is determined only by their winning percentages .",
    "for example , this assumption ignores the impact of the starting pitchers and precludes the situation where one team has a tendency to do particularly well or particularly poorly against another team .",
    "this technique is sometimes called the log5 method of calculating @xmath4 , although we will avoid using this name as there is nothing obviously logarithmic about it .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ e : talent ] ) that @xmath12 substituting this expression into ( [ e : log5 ] ) , we see that @xmath13 not only for @xmath14 but for any positive @xmath10 . the explicit form of @xmath15 was first given by dallas adams @xcite , who also christened it the _ james function_. it makes sense to extend the james function to values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the set @xmath16 , except when @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "in these two cases , we would not have expected to be able to make predictions based on winning percentages alone . moreover",
    ", both cases would be impossible if the two teams had previously competed against each other .",
    "james s procedure can be interpreted as a twofold application of the general method known as the _ bradley  terry model _ ( or sometimes the _ bradley  terry  luce model _ ) . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 have worths @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , the probability that @xmath0 is considered superior to @xmath1 is @xmath21 despite the attribution of this model to bradley and terry @xcite and to luce @xcite , the basic idea dates back to zermelo @xcite .",
    "the question , of course , is how to assign the ",
    "right \" measure for the worth of @xmath0 in a particular setting . in chess , for instance , it is common to express the worth of a player as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the player s elo rating ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( the rating of chess players is the question in which zermelo was originally interested .",
    "good @xcite , who also considered this problem , seems to have been the first to call attention to zermelo s paper . )",
    "another example is james s so - called pythagorean model ( introduced in @xcite and discussed further in @xcite ) for estimating a team s seasonal winning percentage , based on the number @xmath24 of runs it scores and the number @xmath25 of runs it allows . in this case , the worth of the team is @xmath26 and the worth of its opposition is @xmath27 .    in the construction of the james function",
    ", we can view the measure of a team s worth as being obtained from the bradley  terry model itself .",
    "we begin by assigning an arbitrary worth @xmath6 ( taken by james to be @xmath28 ) to a team with winning percentage @xmath28 .",
    "equation ( [ e : talent ] ) can be construed as an application of the bradley ",
    "terry model , where the worth of a team is determined by the assumption that its overall winning percentage is equal to its probability of defeating a team with winning percentage @xmath28 .",
    "equation ( [ e : log5 ] ) represents a second application of the bradley ",
    "terry model , where each team has an arbitrary winning percentage and the measure of its worth comes from the previous application of the model .",
    "this area of study , which is usually called the theory of paired comparisons , has focused from the outset on the question of inferring worth from an incomplete set of outcomes @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a thorough treatment , as well as @xcite and @xcite for additional context . )",
    "james , on the other hand , takes the worths to be known and uses them to determine the probability of the outcomes .",
    "we will adopt a similar point of view , emphasizing a set of axiomatic principles rather than a specific model .",
    "james s justification @xcite for his method does not invoke the bradley  terry model , but rather the fact that the resulting function @xmath15 satisfies six self - evident conditions :    1 .",
    "2 .   @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath31 then @xmath32 , and if @xmath33 then @xmath34 .",
    "4 .   if @xmath35 then @xmath36 , and if @xmath37 then @xmath38 . 5 .",
    "@xmath39 , and if @xmath5 then @xmath40 and @xmath41 . 6 .",
    "@xmath42 .    condition ( 1 ) pertains to the situation where two different teams have the same winning percentage ( as opposed to a single team competing against itself ) . to avoid contradicting ( 5 ) , condition ( 4 ) should exclude the cases where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we will call this set , with this slight correction , the _ proto - james conditions_. ( james originally referred to them as ",
    "conditions of logic . \" ) in addition to presenting some empirical evidence for ( [ e : log5 ] ) , james makes the following assertion .",
    "the james function @xmath15 is the only function that satisfies all six of the proto - james conditions .",
    "jech @xcite independently proposed a similar , albeit shorter list of conditions .",
    "although he did not consider the james conjecture , he was able to prove a uniqueness theorem pertaining to a related class of functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the mathematical theory underlying the james function and to demonstrate that the james conjecture is actually false .",
    "in fact , we will introduce and study a large class of functions that satisfy the proto - james conditions .    while the proto - james conditions are certainly worthy of attention , we prefer to work with a slightly different set .",
    "the following conditions apply to all points @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , except for @xmath48 and @xmath49 :    1 .   @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath50 .",

    "5 .   @xmath15 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath2 for @xmath47 and a strictly increasing function of @xmath2 for @xmath53 .",
    "we shall refer to conditions ( a ) to ( e ) as the _ james conditions_. condition ( d ) , which is not represented among the proto - james conditions , simply states that the whole theory could be reformulated using losing percentages rather than winning percentages , with the roles of the two teams reversed .",
    "together with condition ( c ) , it is equivalent to saying @xmath54 , which may seem more natural to some readers",
    ". it should be clear from ( [ jamesfunction ] ) that the james function satisfies james conditions ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "we will verify condition ( e ) in section [ s : adams ] .",
    "it is fairly obvious that the james conditions imply the proto - james conditions .",
    "condition ( a ) is identical to condition ( 2 ) .",
    "condition ( c ) is condition ( 6 ) , which implies ( 1 ) by taking @xmath55 .",
    "condition ( e ) is stronger than ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and in concert with ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) implies them both .",
    "combined with ( c ) or ( d ) , it also implies that @xmath15 is a non - increasing function of @xmath3 for @xmath46 and a strictly decreasing function of @xmath3 for @xmath5 .",
    "finally , ( b ) implies the second of the three parts of ( 5 ) .",
    "together with ( c ) , it also implies that @xmath56 if @xmath57 . by taking @xmath58 in ( d ) and replacing @xmath59 with @xmath3 ,",
    "condition ( b ) further implies that @xmath60 if @xmath61 , and this together with ( c ) gives @xmath41 for @xmath62 , which is ( a hair stronger than ) the third part of ( 5 ) .",
    "these facts , combined with ( e ) , show that @xmath63 when @xmath5 and @xmath53 , which implies the first part of ( 5 ) .",
    "we will focus our attention on functions that satisfy the james conditions , and hence also the proto - james conditions .",
    "see @xcite , the online supplement to this paper , for an example of a function that satisfies the proto - james conditions but not the james conditions .",
    "while the bradley  terry model is practically ubiquitous , its applicability to this situation is not obvious from an axiomatic perspective .",
    "we now present a self - contained proof that , under an intuitive probabilistic model in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the probabilities of success in simultaneous bernoulli trials , the james function @xmath15 represents the probability @xmath4 .",
    "this model satisfies the assumption of uniformity discussed in section [ s : intro ] .",
    "the following argument was discovered by the third - named author several years ago @xcite , but has not previously appeared in a formal publication .",
    "[ millertime ] the probability @xmath4 that a team with winning percentage @xmath2 defeats a team with winning percentage @xmath3 is given by the james function @xmath64 except when @xmath17 or @xmath18 , in which case @xmath4 is undefined .",
    "let teams @xmath0 and @xmath1 have winning percentages @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "independently assign to each of @xmath0 and @xmath1 either a @xmath65 or @xmath66 , where @xmath0 draws 1 with probability @xmath2 and @xmath1 draws @xmath66 with probability @xmath3 . if one team draws @xmath66 and the other @xmath65 , the team with @xmath66 wins the competition .",
    "if both teams draw the same number , repeat this procedure until they draw different numbers .",
    "the probability that @xmath0 draws 1 and @xmath1 draws @xmath65 on any given turn is clearly @xmath67 , while the opposite occurs with probability @xmath68 .",
    "the probability that @xmath0 and @xmath1 both draw @xmath66 is @xmath69 , and the probability that they both draw @xmath65 is @xmath70 . hence @xmath71 it follows that @xmath72 and @xmath73 whenever @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we can conclude the argument in either of two ways .",
    "since the probability that @xmath0 and @xmath1 draw the same number is @xmath74 , in which case they draw again , @xmath4 must satisfy the functional equation @xmath75p(a , b)\\text{.}\\ ] ] the only case in which we can not solve for @xmath4 is when @xmath76 . by ( [ e : total ] ) , this situation only occurs when @xmath77 , which implies that either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath78 .",
    "alternatively , we may observe that the probability that @xmath0 wins on the @xmath79th trial is @xmath80^{n-1}\\text{,}\\ ] ] and so the probability that @xmath0 wins in at most @xmath79 trials is @xmath81^{k-1}\\text{.}\\ ] ] as @xmath79 tends to @xmath82 , this expression yields a convergent geometric series unless @xmath76 . using ( [ e : total ] ) , we again obtain the james function .",
    "this proof relies on a particular model for the relationship between winning percentages and the outcome of a competition . under different assumptions about this relationship",
    ", it seems possible that we would obtain other approximations for @xmath4 .",
    "any such function would presumably also satisfy the james conditions .",
    "in this section , we will consider several important properties of the james function .",
    "we begin by computing the partial derivatives of @xmath15 , which will lead to an observation originally due to dallas adams .",

    "similarly , @xmath88",
    "^ 3}\\text{.}\\ ] ]    adams makes an interesting remark relating to the mixed second partial derivative @xmath89 ^ 3}\\text{.}\\ ] ] it follows from ( [ e : mixed ] ) that @xmath90 , viewed as a function of @xmath3 , is increasing for @xmath91 and decreasing for @xmath92 , so it is maximized as a function of @xmath3 when @xmath55 . since @xmath90 is positive for every @xmath53 , it must be most positive when @xmath55 . alternatively , ( [ e : mixed ] ) tells us that @xmath93 , viewed as a function of @xmath2 , is increasing for @xmath31 and decreasing for @xmath33 , so it is minimized as a function of @xmath2 when @xmath94 . since @xmath93 is negative for every @xmath5 , we conclude that it is most negative when @xmath94 .",
    "adams interprets these facts in the following manner : since @xmath15 increases most rapidly with @xmath2 when @xmath55 ( and decreases most rapidly with @xmath3 when @xmath94 ) , one should field one s strongest team when playing an opponent of equal strength @xcite . once again , this observation is perhaps more interesting in sports other than baseball , where the star players ( other than pitchers ) play nearly every game when healthy , although james points out that yankees manager casey stengel preferred to save his ace pitcher , whitey ford , for the strongest opposition .",
    "it seems particularly relevant to european soccer , where the best teams engage in several different competitions at the same time against opponents of varying quality , and even the top players must occasionally be rested .    in principle , there are two ways to increase the value of @xmath15 : by increasing @xmath2 or by decreasing @xmath3 . under most circumstances ,",
    "a team can only control its own quality and not that of its opponent .",
    "there are some situations , however , such as the yankees signing a key player away from the red sox , where an individual or entity might exercise a degree of control over both teams . similarly , there are many two - player games ( such as parcheesi and backgammon ) in which each player s move affects the position of both players . in any such setting , it is a legitimate question whether the priority of an individual or team should be to improve its own standing or to diminish that of its adversary .",
    "recall that the gradient of a function signifies the direction of the greatest rate of increase",
    ". the next result , which has apparently escaped notice until now , follows directly from equations ( [ partial1 ] ) and ( [ partial2 ] ) .",
    "[ gradient ] for any point @xmath45 , except where @xmath2 and @xmath3 both belong to the set @xmath16 , the gradient of the james function @xmath15 is a positive multiple of the vector @xmath95 in other words , to maximize the increase of @xmath15 , the optimal ratio of the increase of @xmath2 to the decrease of @xmath3 is @xmath96 .",
    "one consequence of this result is that when two teams have identical winning percentages , the optimal strategy for increasing @xmath15 is to increase @xmath2 and to decrease @xmath3 in equal measure .",
    "the same fact holds when two teams have complementary winning percentages . in all other situations ,",
    "the maximal increase of @xmath15 is achieved by increasing @xmath2 and decreasing @xmath3 by different amounts , with the ratio tilted towards the team whose winning percentage is further away from @xmath28 . in the extremal cases , when one of the two values @xmath2 or @xmath3 belongs to the set @xmath16 , the optimal strategy is to devote all resources to changing the winning percentage of the team that is either perfectly good or perfectly bad .",
    "this observation is somewhat vacuous when @xmath44 or @xmath58 , since @xmath15 is already as large as it could possibly be , although the strategy is entirely reasonable when @xmath43 or @xmath97 .",
    "it also makes sense that the gradient is undefined at the points @xmath48 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath49 , since these winning percentages do not provide enough information to determine how much one team must improve to defeat the other .    if @xmath100 , it is easy to see that @xmath101 , which implies the next result .",
    "[ involution ] if @xmath5 , then @xmath100 if and only if @xmath102 .",
    "in other words , for a fixed value of @xmath2 , the james function is an involution .",
    "the practical interpretation of this result is simple to state , even if it is not intuitively obvious : if team @xmath0 has probability @xmath10 of beating a team with winning percentage @xmath3 , then team @xmath0 has probability @xmath3 of beating a team with winning percentage @xmath10 .",
    "the james conditions already imply this relationship whenever @xmath3 and @xmath10 both belong to the set @xmath16 or the set @xmath103 .",
    "nevertheless , it is not evident at this point whether the involutive property is a necessary consequence of the james conditions .",
    "( example [ ex1 ] will provide an answer to this question . )",

    "the second is that the level curves for the james function ( that is , the set of all points for which @xmath100 for a particular constant @xmath10 ) can be written @xmath106 for @xmath5 .",
    "these level curves are the concrete manifestation of a straightforward principle : if a team @xmath0 improves by a certain amount , there should be a corresponding amount that a team @xmath1 can improve so that the probability of @xmath0 defeating @xmath1 remains unchanged .",
    "each level curve represents the path from @xmath48 to @xmath49 that such a pair would take in tandem .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "we conclude this section with one more observation relating to these level curves .",
    "[ diffeq ] for any @xmath107 , the corresponding level curve for the james function @xmath15 is the unique solution to the differential equation @xmath108 that passes through the point @xmath109 .    another way of stating this result is that , for two teams to maintain the same value of @xmath15 , they should increase ( or decrease ) their winning percentages according to the ratio @xmath110 .",
    "one can either verify this assertion directly , by solving the differential equation to obtain ( [ levelcurve ] ) , or by appealing to proposition [ gradient ] and recalling that the gradient is always perpendicular to the level curve at a particular point .",
    "we will now consider the question of whether there is a unique function satisfying the james conditions .",
    "we begin with the following observation , which is implicit in the construction of the james function .",
    "[ notbrad ] the james function is the only function derived from the bradley  terry model that satisfies the james conditions .",

    ". thus @xmath111 agrees with the james function @xmath15 when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 belong to the interval @xmath98 .",
    "since the james conditions uniquely determine the value of a function whenever @xmath2 or @xmath3 belongs to @xmath16 , the functions @xmath111 and @xmath15 must be identical .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the open unit square @xmath116 .",
    "we will say that any function @xmath117 , defined on the set @xmath118 , that satisfies the james conditions is a _",
    "jamesian function_. our immediate objective is to disprove the james conjecture by identifying at least one example of a jamesian function that is different from the james function @xmath15 .",
    "proposition [ notbrad ] guarantees that any such function , if it exists , can not be derived from the bradley  terry model .",
    "[ ex1 ] we will reverse - engineer our first example of a new jamesian function by starting with its level curves . consider the family of curves @xmath119 defined as follows : @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "( see figure 2 . )",

    "since @xmath242 , viewed as a function of @xmath3 , attains every value in the interval @xmath98 , there exists a @xmath243 in @xmath98 such that @xmath244 .",

    "while it is possible to construct additional examples of non - involutive jamesian functions , it would be reasonable to focus any further investigation on the involutive case .",
