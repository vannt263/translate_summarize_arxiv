    "for many centuries , water and its anomalies have been of much interest to scientists .",
    "a particular rise of interest occurred in the late 1970s after experiments done by angell and speedy seemed to imply some kind of critical phenomenon in supercooled liquid water at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "even though liquid water experiments are limited by spontaneous crystallization below the homogenous nucleation temperature ( @xmath6  k at 1  bar ) , it is possible to further explore the phase diagram by quenching water to far lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "the result of these experiments is an amorphous solid , i.e. a glassy ice , corresponding to an out - of equilibrium state that is very stable with respect to the equilibrium crystalline ice phase .",
    "the amorphous depends on the applied pressure : at low pressure , below @xmath7  gpa , the low density amorphous ice ( lda ) is formed , while at higher pressure the high density amorphous ice ( hda ) is observed @xcite . it has been shown by mishima _",
    "_ that these two amorphous ices are separated by a reversible abrupt change in density that resembles in all its respects an equilibrium first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "raising the temperature of either lda or hda does not turn the sample into a liquid , but leads once again to spontaneous crystallization ( around @xmath8  k ) .",
    "in fact , between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , often called the `` no man s land '' of bulk water , crystallization occurs at a time scale that is too short for current experimental methods , although a new technique is possibly succeeding in the task of measuring the metastable liquid phase @xcite .",
    "computer simulations of water , however , involve time scales small enough to witness spontaneous crystallization and are therefore able to explore liquid water in the `` no man s land '' . in 1992 poole _",
    "@xcite performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations using the st2 water model @xcite , using the reaction field method for the long - range interactions ( st2-rf ) , and discovered a liquid - liquid phase transition ending in a critical point , separating a low density liquid ( ldl ) and a high density liquid ( hdl ) .",
    "these two liquids can be considered to be the liquid counterparts of the lda and hda , respectively .",
    "the existence of the critical point also allows one to understand x - ray spectroscopy results @xcite , explains the increasing correlation length in bulk water upon cooling as found experimentally @xcite , the hysteresis effects @xcite and the dynamic behavior of protein hydration water @xcite",

    "they therefore concluded that ldl does not exist because it is unstable with respect to either the crystal or the hdl phase .",
    "the emphasis in their work is about the difference between a metastable phase , i.e. separated from the stable phase by a finite free - energy barrier , and an unstable state , where the free - energy barrier is absent and the state does not belong to a different phase .    shortly after , poole _",
    "_ @xcite and kesselring _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite presented results using standard molecular dynamics for st2-rf showing the occurrence of the llcp with both hdl and ldl phases metastable with respect to the crystal , but with the ldl not unstable with respect to either the crystal or the hdl .",
