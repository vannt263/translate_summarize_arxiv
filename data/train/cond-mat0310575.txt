    "in 1854 clausius introduced the notion of the entropy of a macroscopic system ( defined up to additive constants ) in a state of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "not long afterwards boltzmann gave a microscopic definition of the entropy @xmath9 of a general macroscopic system in a macrostate defined by values of macrovariables @xmath0 : @xmath10 represents suitable `` coarse - grained '' functions of the system s microstate , given by a point @xmath11 in the @xmath12-dimensional phase space @xmath13 for a @xmath14-dimensional classical system containing @xmath15 particles .",
    "@xmath9 is ( up to constants ) equal to the log of the volume @xmath16 of the phase - space region @xmath17 , defined by the macrostate @xmath0 , i.e.  containing all phase points ( or microstates ) giving rise to this macrostate @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 agrees with the clausius entropy for systems in equilibrium when @xmath18 is just the total energy @xmath2 , of @xmath15 particles in a volume @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that @xmath20 is exponential in the number of molecules in the system explains the origin of the second law in the microscopic dynamics : when a constraint is lifted in a system in equilibrium , thereby affording access to a new equilibrium macrostate @xmath21 of larger entropy per molecule than the original @xmath22 , the overwhelming majority of phase points in @xmath23 will find themselves eventually in @xmath24 , since for a macroscopic system @xmath25 is enormously larger than @xmath20 as well as the volume of the union of all nonequilibrium macrostates without the constraint @xcite @xcite .",
    "boltzmann s interpretation of entropy naturally extends the second law to nonequilibrium macroscopic systems : a ( significant ) violation of the second law will not occur provided the microstate @xmath11 of a physical system prepared in , or evolved into , the macrostate @xmath0 is typical ( or at least not atypical ) of points in @xmath26 as far as the future evolution of @xmath0 is concerned . of course to rigorously prove that @xmath11 should be ( and remain ) typical in this sense is difficult .",
    "it was pointed out , however , in @xcite that a sufficient condition for this is that the evolution of @xmath8 be given by an autonomous deterministic law , i.e.  the value of @xmath0 at any time @xmath27 is determined by its value at time @xmath28 , @xmath29 , for @xmath30 .",
    "such a law implies that , with rare exception , @xmath31 , i.e.  the overwhelming majority of phase - points ( almost all in suitable limits ) @xmath32 will , when evolved according to the microscopic evolution law @xmath33 , be found in @xmath34 for @xmath30 .",
    "it follows then from liouville s theorem that ( with insignificant error ) @xmath35 .",
    "the most common example of a deterministic macro - evolution occurs for simple systems in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , described by the macrovariables @xmath0 representing the locally conserved ( particle , momentum and energy ) densities .",
    "@xmath8 then satisfies deterministic hydrodynamic - type equations , e.g.  the euler or navier - stokes equations , and @xmath36 , which is given by an integral over the volume @xmath19 of the equilibrium entropy density , see @xcite , is then indeed monotone nondecreasing in time .",
    "such a deterministic evolution is however not necessary for the monotonicity of @xmath36 .",
    "there is an enormous disparity between the ( small ) number of possible macrostates ( which are always defined with some macroscopic tolerance in terms of a relatively small number of macrovariables ) and the large number of microstates corresponding to the possible values of the large number of microvariables ( counted say in terms of phase - space cells of volume @xmath37 ) .",
    "even when @xmath6 does not determine @xmath8 , @xmath38 should be nondecreasing to leading order in the size of the system for the overwhelming majority of initial microstates @xmath5 ; see also @xcite .    the choice of macrovariables @xmath0 and the corresponding computation of @xmath9 suitable for describing systems not in lte is a daunting task , especially for complex systems such as polymeric fluids , metals with memory , etc . the first and still paradigmatic step in that direction was taken by boltzmann himself when he computed @xmath39 for the macrovariables @xmath40 corresponding to the coarse - grained ( empirical ) density in the @xmath41 dimensional @xmath42-space for a macroscopic system in a microstate @xmath11 @xcite,@xcite . he found that ( up to constants ) @xmath43    we put the subscript `` gas '' on @xmath44 to emphasize that @xmath45 can be expected to suffice for the adequate specification of the macrostate away from lte only for a dilute gas , where interactions between particles make a negligible contribution to the energy of the system .",
    "in fact it was for such a dilute gas that boltzmann derived a deterministic evolution equation for @xmath46 and proved that the corresponding @xmath47 satisfies the @xmath48-theorem , @xmath49 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for dense fluids , specification of @xmath50 is compatible with many different total energies ( including infinite ones for hard core interparticle potentials ) .",
    "a simple analysis then shows that the phase points @xmath11 of a system with specified energy @xmath2 which is below the maximal energy compatible with @xmath46 will correspond to an exceedingly small minority of the phase points in @xmath51 , i.e.  will be atypical of points in @xmath51 .",
    "there is then no reason to expect for such systems that @xmath52 will increase as the system evolves in time according to its energy conserving hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "it is in fact easy to set up in dense fluids initial macrostates @xmath53 such that for @xmath54 @xmath52 will typically decrease in time when the fluid goes to equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that if one includes in @xmath0 , in addition to @xmath46 , also the total energy @xmath2 , then the entropy @xmath3 should be an increasing function of time , i.e. @xmath3 should satisfy an @xmath55-theorem for general systems , including dense fluids .",
    "it was also noted there that the quantity shown by resibois @xcite to satisfy an @xmath55-theorem for @xmath47 evolving via the modified enskog equation ( expected to be accurate for moderately dense hard sphere gases ) is in fact the boltzmann entropy @xmath3 for a system of hard spheres .    in this work",
    "we use molecular dynamics to investigate the time evolution of @xmath3 for dense fluids interacting with lennard - jones and other types of pair potentials .",
    "we consider in particular situations , such as those in @xcite , where @xmath56 , defined in ( [ bolt ] ) , is expected to decrease .",
    "our simulations , which give a monotone increase of @xmath3 when the number of particles in the system is large , support the hypothesis that the time evolution of a typical microstate in @xmath57 is indeed such that @xmath3 satisfies an @xmath55-theorem .",
    "we also find evidence that @xmath47 itself evolves in a deterministic way , with different microstates with the same @xmath53 give rise to the same @xmath47 , although no equation yielding this evolution is at present known ( at least to us ) for general dense fluids .",
    "this suggests looking for an autonomous equation for @xmath47 ( at a given @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is exactly what is done in the heuristic derivations of the boltzmann and enskog equations @xcite and is discussed extensively in the literature for various other systems , see @xcite .",
    "the validity of the boltzmann equation for dilute gases , i.e.  for typical @xmath58 in the boltzmann - grad limit , was justified rigorously at least for short times , by lanford @xcite .    *",
    "* we consider a system of @xmath15 particles with unit mass in a box @xmath19 .",
    "the microstate is specified by @xmath59 and the dynamics is given by the hamiltonian @xmath60 it follows from the structure of the classical phase space @xmath13 that @xmath61 can be written , c.f .",
    "@xcite , as @xmath62 here @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the log of the momentum ( configuration ) space volume corresponding to the macro - state @xmath65 , @xmath66 with @xmath67 , the spatial density , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the configurational entropy density of an equilibrium system with hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) having particle density @xmath70 and potential energy density @xmath71 .",

    "we first computed @xmath81 , for such a system .",
    "for these simulations , as well as for those described below , we used the verlet algorithm with time mesh @xmath88 .    to carry out the time dependent simulations",
    ", we first let the system reach an equilibrium state .",
    "we then multiplied the speed of each particle with an appropriate factor to obtain a state with too high a kinetic energy , and let the system evolve freely to its new equilibrium state .",
    "this means that the initial @xmath46 was a maxwellian with too high a temperature for the total energy ",
