    "in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm of structure formation , virialized cdm halos are considered to be the building blocks of the mass distribution in the universe .",
    "the properties of dark matter halos , as well as their formation histories and clustering properties , have been studied in great detail using both numerical simulations and analytical approaches such as the ( extended ) press schechter ( 1974 ) formalism .",
    "these studies have shown that halo bias is mass dependent , in that more massive halos are more strongly clustered ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ; sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ; seljak & warren 2004 ; tinker et al .",
    "this mass dependence of the halo bias has played a crucial role in our understanding of the correlation function of both dark matter and galaxies , via the halo model ( e.g. , cooray & sheth 2002 ) , the halo occupation model ( e.g. , jing , mo & brner 1998 ; seljak 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; magliocchetti & porciani 2003 ; berlind et al .  2003 ; zheng et al .",

    "observationally , the clustering strength of galaxy systems ( groups and clusters ) is found to increase with their mean separation @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the number density of objects ( e.g. bahcall & west 1992 ; zandivarez et al .",
    "2003 ; padilla et al .  2004 ; yang et al .",
    "2005b ) . assuming that richer groups are statistically associated with more massive halos",
    ", one can estimate the halo masses of galaxy groups using a theoretical halo mass function , such as the one given by the current @xmath0cdm model ( see yang et al .",
    "2005b ; berlind et al .",
    "2006a ; yang et al .",
    "thus the relation between mean separation and clustering strength can be converted into a relation between halo mass and halo bias . as shown in yang et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , the mass dependence of the halo bias obtained this way from galaxy groups is in good agreement with the prediction of the current @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in addition to the mass dependence , recent simulations have shown that halo bias also depends on the assembly history .",
    "using @xmath2-body simulations , sheth & tormen ( 2004 ) studied the environmental dependence of halo assembly and found that dark matter halos in dense environments assemble at slightly earlier times than halos of the same mass in low density regions .",
    "gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used a very large , high - resolution numerical simulation of structure formation in a @xmath0cdm cosmology to reexamine the mass and age dependence of halo bias .",
    "they found that , for halos of @xmath6 at redshift @xmath7 , the bias factor depends not only on halo mass but also on the halo assembly time .",
    "this result has been confirmed by a number of subsequent investigations ( harker et al .",
    "2006 ; wechsler et al .  2006",
    "; wetzel et al .  2006 ; gao & white 2007 ; jing , suto & mo 2007 ) . the origin of this assembly bias has recently been investigated in a number of papers ( wang , mo & jing 2007 ; keselman & nusser 2007 ; hahn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "if the properties of galaxies that reside in haloes of a given mass correlate with the assembly history of that halo , the assembly bias will impact the galaxy bias , @xmath8 , to the extent that @xmath9 not only depends on halo mass , as generally assumed in hod and clf modeling , but also on the formation history of that halo . using a very crude method for assigning galaxy luminosities to dark matter haloes , reed et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conclude , however , that the luminosity - weighted galaxy ages can not closely trace the assembly epoch of their dark matter hosts , otherwise the observed color - dependence of the clustering can not be reproduced . using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the millennium simulation , croton ,",
    "gao & white ( 2007 ) compared the original simulation to ` shuffled ' versions in which the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass .",
    "they found that the shuffled versions have correlation functions that are different from the original ones at the 5 to 10 percent level , indicating that galaxy properties are ( weakly ) correlated with the halo assembly history .",
    "unfortunately , since their semi - analytical model is not a perfect representation of the true universe ( see e.g. , weinmann et al .",
    "2006b and baldry et al .  2006 ) , it is unclear whether such a correlation also exists in reality .    to test this ,",
    "various authors have examined whether there is any sign of assembly bias in the large scale structure of the observed galaxy distribution . using a galaxy group catalogue constructed from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) examined how the clustering strength of galaxy groups depends on the star formation activity of the central galaxies . at fixed mass",
    "they found that the bias of galaxy groups decreases as the sfr of the central galaxy increases . assuming that galaxies with a more active sfr are bluer",
    ", this implies that groups with a red central are more strongly clustered than groups of the same mass but with a blue central .",
    "surprisingly , a completely opposite trend was found by berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) using the group catalogue constructed by berlind et al .  ( 2006b ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "they found that massive groups with bluer centrals are _ more _ strongly biased on large scales than groups of the same mass but with redder centrals .",
    "tinker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used the ( projected ) galaxy correlation function and galaxy void statistics to test whether the galaxy content of halos of fixed mass is systematically different in low density environments .",
    "using data from the sdss combined with hod models , they find that the luminosity and color of field galaxies are determined predominantly by the mass of the halo in which they reside and have little direct dependence on the environment in which the host halo formed .",
    "since , as shown by sheth & tormen ( 2004 ) , the assembly history of a halo is correlated with its environment , this therefore implies that there is no significant correlation between the color of a galaxy and the assembly history of its dark matter halo .",
    "finally , blanton & berlind ( 2006)compared the actual relationship between galaxy colors and large scale density field to that predicted by the null hypothesis that galaxy colors are only dependent on the mass of the halo in which they reside .",
    "to this extent , they use a similar shuffling technique as croton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but using galaxy groups in the sdss rather than dark matter halos in a semi - analytical model for galaxy formation .",
    "they find that shuffled and unshuffled color - density relations agree to better than 5 percent , indicating that the large scale environment of a group has only a very mild impact on the properties of its member galaxies .",
    "clearly , the current status as to whether galaxy properties are correlated with the halo assembly history is still very confusing .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the dependence of the halo bias on group mass and on the colors of member galaxies , using the galaxy group catalogue recently constructed by yang et al .",

    "an important improvement of this catalogue over that of yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and weinmann et al .",
    "( 2006a ) is that group masses are estimated both from the total luminosity and the total stellar mass of member galaxies , allowing us to examine how the results may be affected by the uncertainties in the estimate of group masses .",
    "furthermore , in order to test the impact of the uncertainties in the group finder and in the methods used to assign masses to our groups , we use a mock galaxy redshift survey ( hereafter mgrs ) constructed from the millennium semi - analytical galaxy sample ( hereafter sam ) of croton et al .",

    "since red groups have larger stellar masses than blue groups of the same luminosity , these two estimates of halo masses , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , may be systematically different for red and blue groups of the same luminosity , which may affect the color dependence of the ggccf discussed above . in figs .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_rp_s ] and [ fig : bias_obs_s_s ] we show the relative bias of groups of different color properties against the projected separation @xmath64 and redshift - space separation @xmath50 for groups with similar @xmath41 .",
    "the color dependence of @xmath72 is clearly significant for groups with @xmath74 , though it is weaker than that shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_rp_l ] and [ fig : bias_obs_s_l ] . this can be explained as follows . because @xmath40 is smaller than @xmath41 for redder groups , for a given mass bin , the average value of @xmath41 of the redder subsample defined by @xmath40 is larger than that defined by @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , the bias of the redder subsample is boosted in the @xmath40 sample because of the increased halo masses .",
    "although @xmath41 is arguably a better estimate of the halo mass ( see yang et al .",
    "2007 ) , the difference in the color dependence of the bias due to the use of different halo mass estimates suggests that further tests are required to assess the reliability of our results .",
    "we will return to this in the next section .    to quantify the dependence of the relative bias @xmath72 on the color of the central galaxy , we calculate the average relative bias factor for groups in each mass bin based on the projected ggccf over the range @xmath75 , and the corresponding bias factor based on the redshift - space ggccf over the range @xmath76 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : bias_obs_colorc ] .",
    "the upper two panels show the relative biases for groups with halo masses based on @xmath40 , while the lower two panels are those for groups with halo masses based on @xmath41 .",
    "the left two panels are results obtained from the projected ggccfs , while the right panels are results obtained from the redshift - space ggccfs .",
    "the related error bars are estimated from the 1-@xmath77 variances of the 100 bootstrap re - samplings .",
    "note that the average masses of groups are slightly different when the group samples g1 - g4 are divided into color subsamples . to take care of the contamination due to such mass difference",
    ", we have corrected the relative bias of the color subsamples relative to the whole sample , using the mean relation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_m ] according to the average @xmath78 of the subsample in question .",
    "such correction is applied throughout when we examine the color dependence of the relative bias .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_colorc ] , at a fixed group mass , the relative bias of groups with red centrals is higher than that of groups with blue centrals .",
    "the color dependence is more significant for groups of lower masses , and becomes insignificant in massive groups with @xmath79 . as already eluded to above ,",
    "the results obtained from the projected and redshift - space ggccfs are very similar , while the color dependence is weaker when using @xmath41 to estimate group masses than when using @xmath40 .",
    "note that as we will show in the next section part of the color dependence is induced by systematic error , which is stronger for group mass @xmath40 . to illustrate to",
    "what extent the color - dependence of the group clustering can be compared with the age - dependence of halo clustering , we show , as the dot - dashed and dot - long - dashed lines , in the lower left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : bias_obs_colorc ] the results for the 20% oldest and the 20% youngest halos obtained by gao et al .",
    "the color - dependence of the group clustering is qualitatively similar to the age - dependence of the halo clustering .",
    "quantitatively , however , while groups with blue centrals have relative bias similar to that of young halos , the bias for low - mass groups with red central galaxies is significantly lower than that of low - mass old halos . thus , the color of the central galaxy and the assembly history of the host halo is correlated , but the relation contains a large random component .",
    "following berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , we also determine the dependence of the relative bias on the overall group color ( using the c1 subsamples defined in section  [ sec_groupsamples ] ) .",
    "the average relative biases of red and blue groups thus defined are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_c12 ] as a function of halo mass .",
    "a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_colorc ] shows that the color dependence of the relative bias based on c1 is weaker than that based on c0 .",
    "the main reason for this is that in c0 groups are separated into three color subsamples , while only two subsamples are used in c1 .",
    "consequently , the red and blue subsamples in c0 are further separated in color - space than those in c1 ( cf . table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "all these results regarding the color dependence of the halo bias are in good , qualitative agreement with those obtained by yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the 2dfgrs , as long as red galaxies are mainly the galaxies with passive star formation . however , they are completely opposite to the results obtained by berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) who , using the sdss group catalogue of berlind et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , found that ( i ) blue groups are more strongly clustered than red groups of the same mass , and ( ii ) the color dependence is stronger for more massive groups . since the galaxy samples and statistical methods used are very similar , these differences more likely result from differences in the group - finding algorithms used or the groups selected .",
    "the general properties of the groups selected by berlind et al .",
    "are similar to the groups used here .",
    "for instance , relationship between group richness and halo mass is about the same for both group catalogs .",
    "however , we do find that the central galaxy luminosity - halo mass relation in their group samples is quite different from that in ours , particularly for groups with masses @xmath80 . in their fig.3(d ) , berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) showed that the central galaxies in low - mass halos have three or four distinctive populations ( with unfilled gaps ) , which are not present in our samples .",
    "thus the groups , especially the low - mass ones , are somewhat different in the two catalogs . on the other hand , as we will show in the next section using mock samples , the use of @xmath40 as group mass induces systematic errors that can produce a significant part of the observed color dependence of the clustering bias factor . since berlind et al . have also used the group masses estimated using the total group luminosities , their results",
    "might also be affected by such systematic effect .",
    "unfortunately , the bias due to the systematic effect is expected to be in the opposite direction as color - dependence found by berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , namely , it should enhance the clustering amplitude of red groups .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of our paper to identify in detail the origin of the discrepancy , we use mock samples in the next section to test the reliability of our results .    before proceeding to the next section",
    ", we follow berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) to check whether the velocity dispersions of the groups in halos of the same assigned mass but with centrals of different colors are the same .",
    "this provides yet another test about the reliability of our mass assignment .",
    "here we measure the velocity dispersions for groups with at least two members using the gapper estimator described by beers , flynn & gebhardt ( 1990 ; see also yang et al .",
    "although the estimate of the velocity dispersion is unreliable for estimating individual halo mass , the stacking result may be a reliable indicator of the mean mass of a set of groups . to show that the color - dependent bias is not a result of systematic mass difference between the color subsamples , we estimate the mean velocity dispersion of each color subsample .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : vd ] for groups of different assigned masses , with upper and lower panels corresponding to masses based on @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the results show clearly that there is no systematic difference between the mean velocity dispersions of groups with red , blue and green centrals .",
    "thus , the color dependence we found in the sdss observation is unlikely due to systematics in the mass assignments .",
    "in this section , we use the mgrs constructed from the millennium semi - analytical galaxy catalogue ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) to investigate the mass and color dependence of the ggccf .",
    "the purpose here is twofold .",
    "first of all , as mentioned above , we want to test the reliability of our results against uncertainties in the identification of galaxy groups , and in the mass assignments .",
    "secondly , we also want to investigate whether the semi - analytical model of croton et al",
    ".  which is fairly successful in matching observational data , actually predicts a color dependence of the halo bias and how it compares to the data presented here .",
    "the ggccfs for the mgrs have been measured using exactly the same method used in section  [ sec : mass_obs ] for the real data .",
    "[ fig : xi_mgrs ] shows the ggccfs for mock groups in different mass bins . comparing these results with the observational results shown in fig.[fig : xi_obs ] )",
    ", one sees that the mass dependence predicted by the model is very similar to that obtained from the sdss .",
    "[ fig : bias_mgrs_m ] shows the corresponding relative bias as a function of group mass . as in the observational data ,",
    "the relative biases are defined with respect to groups with masses in the range @xmath81 .",
    "the mass dependence of the relative bias can again be modeled with quadratic forms , as indicated in the panels . as with the sdss data ,",
    "the results are well matched by the predictions based on the clustering of dark matter halos in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , suggesting that our group finder is quite reliable in grouping galaxies according to their common dark matter halos .",
    "in addition , the halo masses assigned to the groups also have to be fairly reliable , otherwise we would not have been able to recover the strong mass dependence shown .",
    "this is also consistent with the tests described in yang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , where it is shown that the masses assigned to the groups agree with the true halo masses with a scatter @xmath82 dex .",
    "fig.[fig : sam_bias_c0 ] shows the relative biases of red , green and blue groups in the mgrs as function of the assigned group mass . here",
    "the colors refer to those of the central galaxies ( i.e. , the brightest group members ) , which have been determined using the color - magnitude relation shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ col : gau ] . as for the real data ,",
    "the relative bias is defined relative to the ggccf of all groups in the mass bin . in the left - hand panels",
    "the relative biases have been estimated from the projected ggccfs using the data over the range @xmath83 .",
    "the right - hand panels shows the relative bias factors obtained from the redshift - space ggccfs using the data in the range @xmath84 .",
    "the results shown in the upper two panels use group masses based on @xmath40 , while the lower two panels use group masses based on @xmath41 . compared with the observational results shown in fig .  [ fig : bias_obs_colorc ] , the mgrs reveals a significantly stronger color dependence , especially for groups in the lowest mass bin , @xmath81 .    in order to investigate to",
    "what extent this color dependence of the ggccf is affected by selection effects , we compare the results obtained from the mgrs with those obtained directly from the millennium galaxy catalogue . for this purpose , we measure the relative biases directly from the millennium simulation and use the color of the central galaxy to separate halos of a given mass into red , green and blue subsamples . here",
    "we use the auto - correlation function of the dark matter halos ( instead of the ggccf ) _ in real space _ to estimate the relative bias of halos in different subsamples .",
    "the relative biases are defined relative to the correlation function of all groups in the mass bin in question , and are estimated using data in the separation range @xmath85 .",
    "the solid symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : sam_bias_c0 ] show the relative bias factors of red , green and blue halos thus obtained as function of the true halo mass .",
    "clearly , the sam predicts a color dependence . similar to our results ,",
    "red halos are more strongly clustered than blue halos of the same mass , and the color dependence is stronger for less massive halos .",
    "a comparison with the corresponding open symbols , which show the results obtained from the mock group catalogue constructed from the mgrs , indicates that the color dependence in the original data is fairly well recovered by our analysis of the ggccf .",
    "in particular , when using @xmath41 as halo mass estimator , the true trends can be recovered fairly accurately .",
    "quantitatively however , there is discrepancy between the original signal in the millennium simulation and that recovered from the mock groups , especially for blue groups when ggccfs in redshift space are used , in the sense that the recovered color dependence is stronger than the dependence in the original data .",
    "the discrepancy is larger when @xmath40 is used .",
    "the amount of systematics is comparable to the difference between red and blue groups in the observational sample [ see panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig.[fig : bias_obs_colorc ] ] . in order to check further how the color dependence of the group clustering in the sdss data can be affected by the group finder used and the model of halo - mass assignments ,",
    "we carry out an additional test . here",
    "we first randomly re - assign to each central or satellite galaxy of a given stellar mass in the millennium simulation a @xmath43-color according to the color - stellar mass relation of the central or satellite galaxies in the sdss observation .",
    "the absolute magnitude of each mock galaxy is then re - calculated according to the new assigned color .",
    "note that such a color assignment according to the sdss observation makes sure that the color distribution of mock galaxies is the same as that in the observation , thereby reducing any effects that may be produced by the difference in the color distribution .",
    "thus , the re - constructed new mock galaxy catalogue has a similar color - stellar mass relation as the sdss observation .",
    "more importantly , there should not be any color - dependence of group clustering in this new mock catalog . using this catalogue ,",
    "we generate the mgrs again and perform all the same analyses ( i.e. finding groups , assigning halo masses according to luminosity or stellar mass , and calculating the group correlation function ) to obtain the relative bias of corresponding galaxy groups .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] as the open symbols for groups with red ( triangles ) , green ( circles ) and blue ( squares ) central galaxies , defined with the color criteria that is exactly the same as in the observation . for comparison ,",
    "we also show , as the solid symbols , the true relative bias based on the original _ halos _ in the mgrs . the use of halos in the _ mgrs _ ensures that we are comparing the _ same _ set of halos ( groups ) in the same large - scale structures and the differences between the two are simply due to the systematic errors . ideally , the relative biases for the halos in the mgrs should contain no color dependence , and the deviation of the solid symbols from the null hypothesis , @xmath86 , which is at roughly the 1-@xmath77 level , reflects the ` cosmic variance ' in the color assignment .",
    "as can be seen , there is some difference between the open and solid symbols , which indicates the systematic errors introduced by the group - finding procedure and the halo - mass assignment .",
    "the systematic errors are @xmath87 for the cases using @xmath40",
    "( see the upper two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] ) , and are @xmath88 for the cases using @xmath41",
    "( see the upper two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] ) . these are significantly smaller than the difference shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_obs_colorc ] .",
    "finally we have also made a test in which each central or satellite galaxy in the millennium simulation is randomly re - assigned a @xmath43 color according to the color-_magnitude _ relation of the central or satellite galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the overall systematics here is slightly smaller .",
    "based on all these tests with the mock catalog , we conclude that our results are robust against the systematics produced by the group - finding procedure and the halo - mass assignment .",
    "in this paper we have used a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ) to study how the clustering of galaxy groups depends on their masses and , at fixed mass , on the color of their member galaxies .",
    "we use the projected and redshift - space two - point cross correlation functions between groups and galaxies to measure the relative biases for groups of different masses and colors .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the correlation amplitude of galaxy groups depends strongly on their masses , and is in good agreement with the mass dependence of the bias of dark matter halos in the @xmath0cdm concordance cosmology .",
    "2 .   for a given mass ,",
    "the correlation amplitude of groups also depends on the characteristic color of its member galaxies .",
    "red groups are more strongly clustered than blue groups .",
    "this color dependence is more prominent in low - mass groups , and becomes insignificant in groups with masses @xmath89 .",
    "these results are in good , qualitative agreement with those obtained by yang et al .",
    "( 2005b ) from an analysis of galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs , but disagree with the results obtained by berlind et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "the observed color dependence in the data is qualitatively reproduced by the semi - analytical model of croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but the predicted color dependence is much too strong for low - mass halos with @xmath90 .",
    "4 .   the systematic errors that can be induced by the group finder or by the method of assigning masses to the groups are discussed .",
    "and we conclude that our finding of the color dependence of the relative bias in the sdss observation is robust .    unlike the mass dependence of the group clustering which can be straightforwardly linked to the mass dependence of the halo bias ,",
    "an interpretation of the color dependence at fixed mass is less straightforward .",
    "it is tempting to link it to the assembly bias that has recently been discovered in numerical simulations , and which shows that haloes of a given mass that assemble earlier are more strongly clustered .",
    "the assembly time of a dark matter halo , @xmath91 , is typically defined as the lookback time at which its main progenitor reaches a mass that is half of the halo s present day mass .    a straightforward , but naive , interpretation of our results therefore is that halos that assemble earlier contain redder galaxies .",
    "this would not only explain the sign of the color - dependence at fixed halo mass detected here , but since the assembly bias becomes less significant for more massive halos ( e.g. , gao et al .",
    "2005 ; jing et al .",
    "2007 ) , it also naturally explains why the color - dependence is weaker for more massive groups . one way to invoke a positive , causal correlation between the assembly histories of dark matter haloes and the star formation histories of the associated galaxies , is to assume that the epoch of the last major merger , which is strongly correlated with the assembly time ( li et al .",
    "2007b ) , also signals the time at which star formation is terminated",
    ". this may come about if the feedback from merger induced agn activity expels ( or heats ) the gas associated with the merger remnant , thus shutting off the star formation activity ( e.g. , di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "such a merger induced truncation mechanism would ensure that halos that assemble earlier contain redder galaxies .",
    "alternatively , the observed color dependence may be related to the ` archeological ' downsizing .",
    "it is well known that , in hierarchical structure formation , more massive halos assemble later ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 ; van den bosch 2002 ; wechsler et al .",
    "therefore , if indeed haloes that assemble earlier contain redder galaxies , it would imply that more massive haloes ( i.e. , clusters ) contain bluer galaxies than low mass haloes .",
    "this is in clear conflict with observations , which show that more massive galaxies , which typically reside in more massive halos , on average have formed their stars earlier .",
    "an attractive solution to this problem has been proposed by neistein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who introduced an alternative ` halo formation time ' , the time at which the sum over the masses of _ all _ the virialized progenitors with masses above a given minimum mass , reaches half the present day halo mass . as shown by neistein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , contrary to the assembly time , @xmath92 , defined as the accretion time of the last main progenitor , @xmath93 _ increases _ with increasing halo mass , so that it provides a natural explanation for the observed archeological downsizing that galaxies in more massive haloes have older stellar populations .",
    "if the star formation history of a galaxy is correlated with this formation time , it may also explain the color - bias at fixed halo mass .",
    "the reason is that , as demonstrated in neistein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , although the formation time , @xmath94 , and the assembly time , @xmath91 , of halos are anti - correlated when considering the entire halo population , at fixed halo mass @xmath93 and @xmath91 are positively correlated .",
    "thus , at fixed halo mass , a halo that forms earlier will contain a redder galaxy and will also assemble earlier .",
