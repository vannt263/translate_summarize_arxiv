    "the search for exact solutions of the einstein field equations has generated a rich field of models describing relativistic compact objects . since the pioneering work of schwarzschild who obtained the first interior solution describing a uniform density sphere , the modeling of relativistic stars has moved from the regime of toy models",
    "to sophisticated , realistic stellar structures . with the discovery of pulsars , neutron stars and strange stars",
    "there was a need to obtain relativistic analogues of newtonian stars , particularly when the densities of the stellar material was of the order of @xmath0gm  @xmath1 .",
    "the simplistic model of a static uniform density star has been generalised to include the effects of pressure anisotropy , electric charge , scalar field , dark energy and the cosmological constant , on the gross physical properties of compact objects@xcite .",
    "models of relativistic fluid spheres have also been obtained within the framework of higher order theories of gravity including the randall - sundrum brane scenario , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity and lovelock formalisms@xcite . in order to close the system of equations governing the gravitational and thermodynamical behaviour of bounded objects ,",
    "various techniques were employed by researchers working in this field of study : ( i ) imposition of symmetry , ( ii ) adhoc assumptions of the gravitational potentials , ( iii ) specific choices of the fall - off behaviour of the pressure , density or the anisotropy , to name a few@xcite . to construct a stellar model , a physically motivated route , in general , is to impose an equation of state which relates the pressure as a thermodynamical function of the density , ie .",
    ", @xmath2 .",
    "most of the earlier works were centered on imposing a linear equation of state of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "this was later generalised to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the surface density@xcite .",
    "the conditions were relaxed by allowing for anisotropic pressure .",
    "note that works in fundamental particle physics led to the mit - bag model which hinged on an equation of state of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bag constant .",
    "the linear equation of state was further generalised to the quadratic equation of state of the form @xmath10@xcite .",
    "one of the first successful attempts to obtain a generalisation of the newtonian polytrope was achieved by buchdahl@xcite in which he obtained a pseudo - relativistic version of the lane - emden polytrope of index @xmath11 .",
    "herrera and barreto presented a general formalism to generate relativistic polytropes with anisotropic pressure in schwarzschild coordinates@xcite .",
    "their findings also prompted further investigations into the origins of anisotropy , cracking in relativistic stellar models and stability@xcite . in order to fine - tune these models with observations , some researchers employed a mixed polytrope equation of state in which two or more species of particles made up the stellar fluid .",
    "the inclusion of charge within the stellar core led to a plethora of static stellar models in which the role of the electromagnetic field on the stability , mass - radius ratio and redshift was demonstrated@xcite .",
    "issues surrounding the black hole horizon paradox necessitated the search for alternative models of black holes free of horizons .",
    "the gravastar model was first proposed by mazur and mottola @xcite which sought to address many of the problems encountered during the final stages of gravitational collapse .",
    "dynamically the model hinged on the phenomenon that during the latter epoch of gravitational collapse spacetime itself would undergo phase transitions which would halt collapse .",
    "the emerging picture of a gravastar was that of a layered composite : a de sitter interior filled with constant positive ( dark ) energy density @xmath12 featuring an isotropic negative pressure @xmath13 .",
    "this layer is then connected via three intermediate layers to an exterior vacuum schwarzschild solution .",
    "the intermediate relatively thin shell is composed of stiff matter ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "stability of the composite profile is achieved by utilising two infinitesimally - thin shells endowed with surface densities @xmath15 and surface tensions @xmath16 .",
    "an interesting model was proposed by usmani _",
    "et al_@xcite in which they generalised the mazur - mottola gravastar picture to include charge .",
    "in addition , the interior of the gravastar admitted conformal motion .",
    "they were able to show that charged interior de sitter void must generate the gravitational mass .",
    "this mass is accountable for the attractive force that counter - balances the electromagnetic repulsion due to the presence of charge during the collapse process@xcite . in a more recent model , banerjee _",
    "et al_@xcite presented a braneworld generalisation of a gravastar admitting conformal motion .",
    "motivated by the existence of dark energy , lobo and coworkers@xcite have proposed stellar models , the so - called ` dark stars ' in which the equation of state of is of the form @xmath3 in which @xmath17 .",
    "it has been proposed that in the phantom regime ( @xmath18 ) , the extremely high pressures may invoke a topological change rendering the dark energy star to a wormhole .",
    "an interesting proposal regarding dark energy and dark matter is treating them as different manifestations of a single entity .",
    "this proposal leads to the chaplygin gas model in which the equation of state derives from string theory .",
    "various applications of the chaplygin gas model have been pursued in order to account for cosmological observations such as acceleration of the cosmic fluid and structure formation .",
    "the chaplygin equation of state has been subsequently modified to a more generalized chaplygin gas equation of state .",
    "the generalised chaplygin equation of state has been employed to model dark stars which are remnants of continued gravitational collapse .",
    "the idea here is that the dark energy provides sufficient repulsion to halt collapse leading to stable bounded configurations free of horizons and singularities@xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section @xmath19 we introduce the field equations necessary for the modeling of a spherically symmetric star within the framework of general relativity . in section @xmath20 .",
    "we present a particular solution describing the interior of the star in which the matter content obeys a generalised chaplygin equation of state .",
    "the junction conditions required for the smooth matching of the interior spacetime to the exterior schwarzschild solution are worked out in section @xmath21 .",
    "a detailed physical analysis of the geometrical and thermodynamical behaviour of our model is presented in section @xmath11 .",
    "we discuss the stability , energy conditions and mass - radius relation in sections @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in section @xmath25 .",
    "we consider a model which represents a static spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid configuration obeying a generalised chaplygin equation of state .",

    "hence , any solution describing a static spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distribution obeying a generalised chaplygin equation of state in isotropic coordinates can be easily determined by a single generating function @xmath29 .",
    "in order to close the system of equations several choices for @xmath29 can be made .",
    "it is interesting to note that the choice of the metric potential @xmath29 determines the gravitational and thermodynamical behaviour of the model .",
    "hence the choice of @xmath29 must satisfy all the requirements for a realistic stellar model .",
    "recent work by naidu and govender@xcite have shown that the end - state of gravitational collapse resulting from a dynamically unstable static core is ` sensitive ' to the choice of the initial metric functions .",
    "they show that for the same @xmath29 but with two distinct initially static cores ; ( i ) vanishing radial pressure within the static configuration and ( ii ) uniform density interior , the final outcome of dissipative collapse leads to very different temperature profiles .",
