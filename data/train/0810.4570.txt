    "@xcite shows that ratios of hard x - ray ( 210 kev ) to [ oiii ] luminosities for seyfert 1 galaxies are distributed around 1.59 dex with a standard deviation of only 0.48 dex .",
    "the [ oiii ] luminosity of ngc 2273 was found to be 4.2@xmath310@xmath59 erg s@xmath7 by @xcite assuming @xmath45 = 70 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "based on the mean ratio given by @xcite , this [ oiii ] luminosity suggests that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity from the agn should be 1.6@xmath310@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 in the 210 kev band .",
    "this estimate is consistent with our result .",
    "thus , the ionized region emitting the [ oiii ] line is most likely powered by the intense emission from the nucleus .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 2273 was consistent with being compton thick because of its low luminosity ratio , @xmath49/@xmath13}$ ] , of @xmath20 0 dex .",
    "our suzaku observation allows us to measure the 2 - 10 kev intrinsic luminosity of ngc 2273 , and suggests that ngc 2273 has a similar intrinsic ratio as those of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "we note that ngc 2273 was undetected in a 12 ks observation by the pds on - board bepposax@xcite .",
    "they obtained a 1@xmath28-upper limit of 0.096 c s@xmath7 in the 15 - 100 kev band , which corresponds to a 15 - 40 kev flux of @xmath05@xmath310@xmath84 erg s@xmath7 @xmath5 , assuming the same spectral shape as that of mrk 3 .",
    "this upper limit is about half of our detected flux .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by time variability of the absorbed power - law emission on a time scale of years .",
    "if ngc 2273 lacked the absorbed power - law emission , the observed flux would be reduced to @xmath05@xmath310@xmath84 erg s@xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "the absence of the absorbed emission may be caused by a decrease of the intrinsic luminosity and/or an increase of the absorption column up to @xmath8 3.5@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite found [ nii ] + h@xmath1 emission associated with a nuclear ring , and this emission was inferred to be produced by star - formation activity in the ring .",
    "the soft x - rays represented by a thin - thermal model with @xmath85@xmath00.6 kev may be associated with the star - formation activity .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , @xmath86 , of the thin - thermal component was estimated to be 6@xmath310@xmath87 erg s@xmath7 in the 0.5  2.0 kev band .",
    "this galaxy has luminous far - infrared emission with @xmath88 = 2.9@xmath310@xmath60 erg s@xmath7 ( londsdale et al .",
    "the observed 0.52 kev luminosity is nearly equal to expectations given the ratio of @xmath89/@xmath88 for starburst galaxies @xcite . in the thin - thermal model , the absorption by @xmath22= ( 2.9@xmath35)@xmath310@xmath36 @xmath5 is required .",
    "the absorption can be explained by an obscuration of hii regions in the galaxy ring ( ferruit et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the soft x - rays may come from a photoionized region as often seen in other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the scattering fraction is found to be @xmath00.4% , which is about half that found in mrk 3 @xcite . in this model , the additional lines at @xmath00.7 kev and @xmath01.8 kev were explained by the emission from photo - ionized plasma .",
    "the line at @xmath01.8 kev suggests a lower - ionization form of si in the photoionized region of ngc 2273 compared with that of mrk 3 .    since the observed soft emission is consistent both with thin thermal emission from the star - forming region , and with a scattered component often seen in seyfert 2 galaxies , we can not conclusively determine its origin .",
    "a deep chandra observation could possibly separate the thin thermal emission from the nuclear emission , since the h@xmath1 region is often coincident with the thin - thermal emission region , and the diameter of the circumnuclear region is about 4@xmath90 .      using the iron lines , we found the reflecting matter is in a low ionization state with @xmath69 @xmath20 1 erg cm s@xmath7 , suggesting that the reflecting matter is located at some distance from the x - ray source : @xmath91 ( pc ) .",
    "a characteristic broad - line region size ( @xmath92 ) has been shown to be related to the x - ray , uv , and optical continuum luminosities @xcite . using their relationship , the characteristic @xmath92",
    "was estimated to be @xmath93 ( pc ) .",
    "the distance of the reflecting matter is larger than the characteristic size of broad line region of ngc 2273 .",
    "it is natural to consider the reflection matter to be the dusty torus which also obscures the broad line region in this seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "we tried to determine the properties of the dusty torus of ngc 2273 by fitting the reflection component seen in the observed spectrum with the reflection model based on simulations .",
    "although the opening angle of the torus was poorly constrained , we found that we observe the nucleus along a line of sight intercepting the torus near its edge . if the photon index was fixed at 1.9 , the intrinsic luminosity in the 210 kev band and the column density of the torus along the equatorial plane were estimated to be 1.9@xmath310@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 and 4.8@xmath9410@xmath4 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the large column of the torus naturally explains the observed large iron line ew of 1.8 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large column predicts a large fraction of cs up to 0.2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the torus geometry ,",
    "the column density should be small , and/or the opening angle should be large to obtain such a small cs .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations using the torus geometry to explain the small cs .",
    "figure 7 shows the fraction of the cs as a function of column density and opening angle .",
    "the large opening angle seems to be inconsistent with the small fraction of the scattering x - rays . to resolve the puzzle about the small cs , an accurate measurement of the cs using an instrument with high energy resolution , such as the x - ray micro - calorimeter onboad _ astro - h _ , is crucial .",
    "we observed the weak compton - thick seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 2273 with the japanese x - ray satellite suzaku , and detected hard x - rays above 10 kev .",
    "the flux in the 15 - 40 kev is about 1@xmath310@xmath37 erg s@xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "first , the broad - band spectrum from 0.3 to 40 kev was fitted with thin - thermal plus reflection components .",
    "the best - fit photon index was found to be 1.5 , smaller than the canonical value of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we then added an absorbed power - law component to the model .",
    "when we fixed the photon index at 1.9 , the absorbed column and intrinsic luminosity in the 210 kev band were found to be 1.5@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 and 2@xmath310@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "our observation reveals the obscured nucleus of ngc 2273 .",
    "the luminosity ratio , @xmath95}$ ] , for ngc 2273 is similar to those for seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this indicates that the photoionized region that is emitting the [ oiii ] lines is consistent with being powered by the nuclear activity . for the soft x - ray emission below 2 kev",
    ", it could be represented equally well by thin - thermal emission or by a scattered emission model as seen in mrk 3 , and thus we could not obtain a conclusive result on the origin of the soft component .    a strong iron k@xmath1 line with an ew of 1.8 kev was detected .",
    "to achieve such a large ew , the direct light must be blocked by thick matter with @xmath22 @xmath8 2@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "this column density is consistent with the spectral fitting using a model based on a monte carlo simulation .",
    "however , the large column density is inconsistent with the observed small fraction of cs of the iron k@xmath1 line .",
    "we also detected a weak iron k@xmath67 line with a center energy of @xmath07.0 kev .",
    "from the properties of k@xmath1 and k@xmath67 lines , we conclude that the iron emitting matter is in a low ionization states of @xmath20 fe viii , which indicate that the iron emitting matter is located far from the x - ray source .",
    "we fitted the hard x - ray emission with a reflection model based on a monte carlo simulation , assuming a simple torus geometry .",
    "although the opening angle of the torus was not constrained well , it was found that we observe the nucleus along a line of sight intercepting the torus near its edge .",
    "the column density of the torus along the equatorial plane is 4.8@xmath9610@xmath4 @xmath5 if the photon index is fixed at 1.9 .",
