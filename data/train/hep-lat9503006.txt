    "chiral yukawa models on the lattice are interacting fermion - higgs field theories with a chiral symmetry , which are useful for studying the standard model on the lattice in the absence of gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of such models , in particular the location of fixed points and second order phase transition lines , is of interest for the definition of corresponding continuum field theories .",

    ", we take the bare higgs self - coupling equal to @xmath1 , which fixes the radial mode of the higgs field @xmath2 .",
    "the phase diagram also depends on the details of the model , but the phase structure in the small to intermediate-@xmath3 region is similar in most models .",
    "we shall concentrate on this part of the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which is sufficient for our purposes , but the considerations presented here are also valid for critical points at large-@xmath3 , where applicable",
    ". there are paramagnetic ( pm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( am ) and possibly ferrimagnetic ( fi ) phases , characterized by the vacuum expectation values of the spatial average and staggered average ( this means that fields at odd sites contribute with a minus sign ) of the higgs field and the fermion condensate . in the context of chiral yukawa models , phases where both the higgs field and its staggered analogue have non - zero expectation value are known as fi phases @xcite .    in recent years , various kinds of yukawa models , based on different lattice fermion actions and with different symmetry groups ,",
    "have been studied both using mean - field methods and numerically @xcite . here",
    "we shall concentrate on the mean - field approach @xcite . because of the difficulty of dealing with the fermion determinant exactly , mean - field techniques are often applied in combination with small or large-@xmath3 expansions . in ref .",
    "@xcite this type of analysis was extended to fi phases .",
    "although fi phases start off at values of @xmath3 where one might question the validity of the small-@xmath3 expansion involved , it was argued that the real expansion parameter is the quantity @xmath4 , which remains small as long as one keeps close to the pm phase .",
    "furthermore , the phase structure of the models studied , obtained from numerical simulation , appeared to be well - described by the mean - field results .    in a recent publication @xcite ,",
    "mean - field calculations were presented for a general class of chiral yukawa models with different symmetry groups and lattice fermion actions .",
    "( the details of this approach differ somewhat from other applications of mean - field methods in the truncation of the fermion determinant , but this is of no importance here . )",
    "the authors claim that , in general , if the pm  fm and pm  am phase transition lines intersect at a point @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , then they must necessarily continue beyond the point @xmath5 with smooth first derivatives at @xmath5 .",
    "there would always be a fi phase , with the pm ",
    "fm line continuing as an am  fi phase transition line and the pm  am line as an fm  fi line . ( everything within the mean - field approximation . )",
    "this is in contrast with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where discontinuities were observed in the slopes of the phase transition lines at @xmath5 , with indications in one model @xcite that a fi phase is absent at all .",
    "( again , within the mean - field approximation . )",
    "these discrepancies motivated us to carry out the present study , which may however have a wider applicability .",
    "we analyse the phase structure around the point @xmath5 from a general point of view , in the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is found that the first derivatives of the second order phase transition lines , assuming that they intersect , are in general _ discontinuous _ at @xmath5 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and no conclusion can be drawn _ a priori _ about the existence of a fi phase . after presenting a general demonstration in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we illustrate the results with a simple example in sec .",
    "for definiteness we keep in mind a phase structure as in fig .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , the phase of the system at a point @xmath6 is determined by minimizing the free energy @xmath7 with respect to a number of mean fields @xmath8 and staggered mean fields @xmath9 @xmath10 , collectively denoted as @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "( @xmath7 is a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with coefficients depending on @xmath3 and @xmath13 . )",
    "this gives the mean - field equations @xmath14 a solution of these equations corresponds to a ( local ) minimum of @xmath7 if the matrix @xmath15 of second derivatives at the solution is positive definite .",
    "a second order phase transition occurs when one of the eigenvalues of this matrix goes through zero : a negative mode develops , destabilizing the original solution and replacing it by one with a lower free energy , belonging to a different phase .",
    "therefore , the condition for a second order phase transition line is given by the additional equation @xmath16 if there is only one mean field @xmath11 and one staggered mean field @xmath12 this becomes @xmath17    in the chiral yukawa models under consideration , the free energy @xmath7 is symmetric under a sign change of all the fields @xmath8 at the same time or all the fields @xmath9 at the same time .",
    "this implies the absence of terms containing odd powers of @xmath11 or @xmath12 in the taylor expansion of @xmath7 , such as @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , at the four phase transition lines under study here , either all the @xmath19 or all the @xmath20 or both . hence @xmath21 there and eq .  ( [ detzero ] ) simplifies , @xmath22 which of the two factors in this expression is zero depends on which phase transition line one considers ; at the intersection point @xmath5 both factors are zero .    for definiteness we shall focus on the pm  fm and am  fi transitions",
    ". then condition ( [ detzero2 ] ) becomes @xmath23 since in this case the unstable mode is in the direction of the @xmath11 fields .",
    "along the pm  fm line , @xmath24 and the solution to eq .",
    "( [ detzero3 ] ) is readily obtained . along the am - fi line , however , @xmath25 .",
    "one has to solve eqs .",
    "( [ mfeqs ] ) and ( [ detzero3 ] ) simultaneously , to find @xmath26 and the function @xmath27 parametrizing the line .",
    "this procedure was applied numerically for phase diagrams of chiral yukawa models based on the zaragoza proposal @xcite with the ` most local ' and ` roma i ' @xcite fermion actions @xcite .    here , we are especially interested in the behaviour of the free energy @xmath7 in the vicinity of the point @xmath5 . in this region , close to the pm phase , the mean fields are small and one can study the phase structure by considering an expansion in @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in ref .  @xcite it is claimed that it is sufficient for this purpose to know @xmath7 up to quadratic terms in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the following calculation of the derivatives of the phase transition lines at @xmath5 will show , however , that quartic terms ( or , in their absence , higher order terms ) are indispensable ; neglecting them leads to incorrect statements about a possible fi phase near @xmath5 .",
    "the pm  fm and am  fi phase transition lines are given by a continuous function @xmath27 whose derivative we wish to determine . defining @xmath28",
    "we can write eq .",
    "( [ detzero3 ] ) for these lines as @xmath29 taking the derivative of this equation in the direction tangential to the line we find @xmath30 leading to a slope @xmath31 on the left hand ( pm  fm ) side of point @xmath5 , @xmath32 and eq .  ( [ slope ] ) reduces to @xmath33 on the am ",
    "fi side , however , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath34 approaches @xmath5 linearly in @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in accordance with a mean - field critical exponent of @xmath37 for @xmath12 in this region ( cf .",
    "the example in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) .",
    "it follows that both the numerator and the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) receive an additional non - zero contribution on this side , so that @xmath38 is discontinuous at @xmath5 .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the change of slope between the pm  am and fm  fi lines .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the am  fi and pm  fi lines thus obtained ( at least , infinitesimally close to @xmath5 ) remain ` candidate phase transition lines ' only until free energy considerations establish that the phases on both sides of the lines correspond to absolute minima of the free energy .",
    "the slope of the am ",
    "fi line suggested by these calculations may , for example , come out bigger than that of the pm  fi line .",
    "( this does in fact happen , at least to lowest order in the yukawa coupling @xmath3 , in a chiral yukawa model based on the roma i action @xcite . ) in that case , a comparison of free energy values should indicate which of the calculated lines does or do not correspond to a true second order phase transition .",
    "we would like to illustrate these results with a simple model of one mean field @xmath11 with its staggered analogue @xmath12 , described by a quartic free energy @xmath7 , @xmath39 where the parameters @xmath40 are well - behaved functions of @xmath3 and @xmath13 .",
    "we assume the presence of pm , fm and am phases as in fig .  [ fig1 ] , _ i.e. _ , @xmath41 increases and @xmath42 decreases with increasing @xmath13 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are such that the pm  fm and pm  am lines meet in a point @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , for stability of @xmath7 , we require @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . apart from these stability conditions , one can consider this model as the expansion of a general free energy in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath5 up to quartic terms in the fields .    in those points of the @xmath6-plane where both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the mean - field equations ( [ mfeqs ] ) imply that the system is in a pm phase with @xmath50 and free energy normalized to zero .",
    "if @xmath51 or @xmath52 we are in one of the broken phases , fm , am or fi . condition ( [ detzero3 ] ) for the pm  fm and am  fi second order phase transition lines becomes @xmath53 along the pm ",
    "fm line this becomes simply @xmath54 , whereas along the am ",
    "fi line we need the value of @xmath12 which follows from the mean - field equations ( [ mfeqs ] ) , taken at @xmath55 , @xmath56 at the point @xmath5 , both @xmath54 and @xmath57 , whereas in general @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are non - zero .",
    "close to @xmath5 we can therefore write , @xmath61 where @xmath62 stands for higher orders in the @xmath63 expansion . the signs in front of @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "have been chosen such that both are positive . in terms of these coefficients ,",
    "the slopes of the pm  fm and pm  am lines at @xmath5 are ( cf .  eq .  ( [ slope2 ] ) ) @xmath66 in order to find the am  fi slope at @xmath5 we solve eqs .",
    "( [ detzero4 ] ) and ( [ hseq ] ) to lowest order in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we find @xmath67 corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath37 for @xmath12 as mentioned earlier , and @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "( [ slope ] ) ) .",
    "it is interesting to express eq .",
    "( [ ramfi ] ) as a ` weighted average ' of the pm  fm and pm  am slopes : @xmath69 similarly , we find for the fm  fi slope @xmath70    the discontinuities in the slopes are evident . only for @xmath71",
    "the first derivatives of these phase transition lines are continuous ( ignoring special cases like @xmath72 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the trivial case that there is no coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as mentioned earlier .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath73 eq .  ( [ ramfi2 ] ) tends to @xmath74 , while in the limit @xmath75 which can be taken simultaneously eq .",
    "( [ rfmfi2 ] ) leads to @xmath76 . in this case",
    "the am  fi and fm  fi lines would be ` interchanged ' compared with the @xmath71 case .",
    "this obviously indicates that at least one of the calculated ` candidate transition lines ' does not represent a genuine phase transition , and additional free energy considerations must determine the real nature of the transitions , as discussed before .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the am  fi and fm  fi slopes as a function of @xmath77 . in the limit that @xmath77 approaches its ` stability lower bound ' @xmath78",
    ", these lines form a 180 degree angle . upon increasing @xmath77 this angle decreases , until it vanishes for @xmath79 . for still larger values of @xmath77 ,",
    "corresponding to strong coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the free energy , the fi phase disappears ( at least in a neighbourhood of the point @xmath5 ; higher order terms in eqs .",
    "( [ abcde - exp ] ) may give rise to a fi phase a little farther out , as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and instead there is a first order transition separating the am and fm phases .",
    "for determining the phase structure close to the point @xmath5 where several phases meet , in a mean - field approximation , it is not sufficient to expand the free energy up to terms quadratic in the mean fields .",
    "quartic terms are crucial for determining the slopes of the transition lines enclosing the fi phase , and in general the slopes are discontinuous at @xmath5 . such behaviour was observed in mean - field studies of phase diagrams of chiral yukawa models @xcite , where the ( candidate ) transition lines bordering the fi phase were determined numerically .",
    "these results explain the discrepancy signalled in sec .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite incorrectly assumed that it is sufficient to consider the free energy up to quadratic terms in the mean fields .",
    "as a consequence , the conclusions drawn there about the presence of fi phases and the transition lines separating them from the fm and am phases are incorrect .",
    "however , the results for the pm  fm and pm  am lines are not affected .",
    "we emphasize that these conclusions do not depend on the approximations made in the treatment of the fermion determinant in chiral yukawa models . the actual location and slopes of the various phase transition lines",
    "do , however , because different approximations lead to different ` effective ' free energies .",
    "hence , improved approximations of the fermion determinant may change the conclusion about the existence of a fi phase , apart from the limitations of the mean - field approximation . +",
