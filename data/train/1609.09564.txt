    "observational evidences of a broad fek@xmath0line feature are found in the x - ray spectra of some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such as mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite , ngc 3516 @xcite , 1h 0707 - 495 @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the broad fek@xmath0line is generally believed to originate from the inner region of the accretion disc via the k - shell fluorescence process , and to be broadened due to the doppler boosting , gravitational redshift and the transverse doppler effect @xcite .",
    "the energy at which the `` red '' wing of the broad line truncates is directly linked to the inner radius of the accretion disc that is commonly thought to be at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "the spin of the black hole , which is related to the isco through a monotonic relation @xcite , can be inferred by modeling the broad fek@xmath0line profile @xcite .    besides its mass , an astrophysical black hole is completely characterized by its spin .",
    "the distribution of the black hole spin may yield important insights into the growth history and accretion process of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) .",
    "for instance , models in which smbh growth is dominated by bh - bh mergers can lead to a bimodal distribution with one peaked at 0 and the other located at @xmath5 , whereas growth via gas accretion predicts a rapidly spinning or a slowly spinning population depending upon whether the bhs gain their masses via prolonged accretion or chaotic accretion @xcite .",
    "moreover , spin also determines the radiative efficiency , which is the mass - to - energy conversion efficiency , and thus influences how efficiently bhs accrete mass during the accretion phase .",
    "black hole spin can also be a potent energy source , and may drive the powerful relativistic jets that are seen from many bh systems through the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "there have been several studies for charactering the broad fek@xmath0line and measuring the spin of smbh based on relativistic reflection spectra in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a significantly broad fek@xmath0line is detected in only @xmath6 per cent of the sources in previous studies with different samples . in total , detections of the broad fek@xmath0line are reported in the x - ray spectra of @xmath7 agns . among those ,",
    "about 22 sources have reliable spin measurements @xcite , making it difficult to draw any robust statistical inferences on the distribution of bh spin .",
    "the reason for the lack of apparent relativistic broad fek@xmath0line in the x - ray spectra of some agn is still unclear .",
    "observationally , one possible explanation is the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the x - ray data for the majority of agn .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the broad fek@xmath0line is revealed in the composite x - ray spectrum of ic 4329a observed by _ suzaku _ , while it is absent in each individual observation due to the low s / n of the data .",
    "indeed , to determine accurately the continuum spectrum and to reveal unambiguously the fek@xmath0line profile , a large number of x - ray photons collected at high energies is required @xcite . theoretically , the strength of the line is a function of the geometry of the accretion disc , which determines the solid angle subtended by the reflecting matter as seen by the x - ray source .",
    "it also depends on the elemental abundances of the reflecting matter , the inclination angle at which the reflecting surface is viewed , and the ionization state of the surface layers of the disc .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 11 seyfert galaxies observed by xmm - newton that appear to be missing a broad fek@xmath0line .",
    "they argued that the lack of apparent relativistic fek@xmath0line can be explained if this feature becomes indistinguishable from the underlying continuum , as a result of a combination of several effects , e.g. blending and comptonization in an ionized disc , strong relativistic effects and , in some cases , a high disc inclination .",
    "calculations have also shown that the ionization state of the accretion disc , which will affect the observed line energy as well as the line equivalent width ( ew ) of the broad line @xcite , depends strongly on the accretion rate .",
    "thus a correlation between the properties of the broad fek@xmath0line and the accretion rate is expected .",
    "such a correlation has been reported in @xcite , although a relativistic line is statistically not required by their data .    in order to investigate the correlation between the properties of the broad fek@xmath0line and",
    "the physical parameters of agn , a homogeneously selected sample of agn with well measured optical parameters is preferred .",
    "the virial bh mass @xmath1 of agn can be estimated through the empirical relations using the emission line widths and continuum luminosities @xcite .",
    "the eddington ratio @xmath2 is given by @xmath8 , where the @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity @xmath11 is usually estimated from the integration of the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) or from a single band assuming a bolometric correction .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 for individual sources or small samples in previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) were derived using different data analysis methods , bh mass estimation formalisms and/or heterogeneous data sets . because of the lack of large homogeneously selected samples with high s / n x - ray data and well measured optical parameters , it is still unclear how is the appearance / property of the broad fek@xmath0line dependent on the physical properties of agn .",
    "x - ray spectral stacking is an effective way to obtain composite spectra with very high s / n .",
    "a broad relativistic fe k@xmath0 line is found in the stacked spectra of the lockman hole field using _ xmm - newton_observations @xcite .",
    "however , while a narrow line is significantly detected , the broad line is not clearly seen in the stack spectra of different samples in previous studies @xcite .",

    "xmm - newton_in @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the low average s / n of the spectra , which make the continuum not to be well determined , can explain the low significance of the broad line in previous works .",
    "the non - detection of the broad line in the average spectra , which are obtained using samples including sources with diverse properties , can also be interpreted if the property of the relativistic line is highly dependent on one or more physical parameters of agn . by applying the same rest - frame x - ray spectral stacking method @xcite to a sample of nls1 galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that there exists a prominent broad fek@xmath0line in the composite x - ray spectrum .",
    "they suggested that broad fek@xmath0line is perhaps common in agn with high @xmath2 ( e.g. nls1 galaxies ) .",
    "the average properties of the relativistic fe k@xmath0 line for a uniform selected bls1 galaxies sample have not been explored yet , even though a broad fek@xmath0line is detected in several bls1 galaxies .    in this paper , using a large homogeneously selected sample of agn which have well measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we investigate how the detection / property of the broad fek@xmath0line depends on the physical parameters , such as the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and optical classification of agn , by means of x - ray spectral stacking .",

    "this optical catalogue , being the parent sample of the intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) agn sample of @xcite , consists of 8862 objects at @xmath16 that were homogeneously selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss - dr4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sources in the optical catalogue were matched to the third generation _ xmm - newton_serendipitous source catalogue ( 3xmm - dr5 ) using a searching radius of 5arcsec .",
    "we selected those having more than 60 net source counts detected with either the epic pn or the combined mos detectors in the rest - frame 2 - 10kev band . in total , the sample includes 156 sources that have 212 _ xmm - newton_observations .",
