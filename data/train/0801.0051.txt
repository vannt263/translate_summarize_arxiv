    "the series terminates at the last nonzero element @xmath12 of the continued fraction .",
    "the minkowski question mark function was investigated by many authors . in this subsection",
    "we give an overview of available literature .",
    "+ denjoy @xcite gave an explicit expression for @xmath13 in terms of continued fraction expansion ; that is , formula ( [ min ] ) .",
    "he also showed that @xmath0 is purely singular : the derivative , in terms of the lebesgue measure , vanishes almost everywhere .",
    "salem @xcite proved that @xmath0 satisfies the lipschitz condition of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and this is in fact the best possible exponent for the lipschitz condition .",
    "the fourier - stieltjes coefficients of @xmath0 , defined as @xmath16 , where also investigated in the same paper ( these coefficients also appeared in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "numerical estimates for this constant were obtained in @xcite and @xcite ; based on the three term functional equation , we are able to calculate the kinney s constant to a high precision ( in the appendix of @xcite we calculate @xmath20 exact digits ; note that some digits presented in @xcite are incorrect ) . also , if @xmath21 , @xmath0 at a point @xmath22 satisfies the lipschitz condition with exponent @xmath23 .",
    "the function @xmath0 is mentioned in @xcite in connection with a `` box '' function . in @xcite lagarias and tresser",
    "introduce the so called @xmath24tree : an extension of the farey tree which contains all ( positive and negative ) rationals .",

    "stolarsky introduced what they call stern polynomials .",
    "the construction is analogous to similar constructions given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite all polynomials have coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath27 , and their structure is compatible with regular continued fraction algorithm . in @xcite dushistova and moshchevitin find conditions in order @xmath31 and @xmath32 to hold ( for certain fixed positive real @xmath7 ) in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , where @xmath35 $ ] is represented by a continued fraction .",
    "the nature of singularity of @xmath0 was clarified by viader , parads and bibiloni @xcite . in particular , the existence of the derivative @xmath36 in @xmath37 for fixed @xmath7 forces it to vanish .",
    "some other properties of @xmath0 are demonstrated in @xcite . in @xcite kessebhmer and stratmann studied various fractal geometric aspects of the minkowski question mark function @xmath13 .",
    "they showed that the unit interval can be written as the union of three sets : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",

    "the notions and technique were developed earlier by authors in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite deals with the interrelations among the additive continued fraction algorithm , the farey tree , the farey shift and the minkowski question mark function .",
    "the motivation for the work @xcite is a fact that the function @xmath0 can be characterized as the unique homeomorphism of the real unit interval that conjugates the farey map with the tent map . in @xcite panti",
    "constructs an @xmath46-dimensional analogue of the minkowski function as the only homeomorphism of an @xmath46-simplex that conjugates the piecewise - fractional map associated to the mnkemeyer continued fraction algorithm with an appropriate tent map . in @xcite bonanno and isola introduce a class of @xmath27-dimensional maps which can be used to generate the binary trees in different ways , and study their ergodic properties .",
    "this leads to studying some random processes ( markov chains and martingales ) arising in a natural way in this context .",
    "in the course of the paper the authors also introduce a function @xmath47 , which is , of course , exactly @xmath13 .",
    "okamoto and wunsch @xcite construct yet another generalization of @xmath0 , though their main concern is to introduce a new family of purely singular functions .",
    "meanwhile , the paper by grabner , kirschenhofer and tichy @xcite , out of all papers in the bibliography list , is the closest in spirit to the current article . in order to derive precise error bounds for the so called garcia entropy of a certain measure",
    ", the authors consider the moments of the continuous and singular function @xmath48)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{n-1}3^{-(a_{1}+ ... +a_{n}-1)}(q_{n}+q_{n-1})$ ] , where @xmath49 stand for a corresponding denominator of the convergent to @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "lamberger @xcite showed that @xmath13 and @xmath51 are the first two members of a family ( indexed by natural numbers ) of mutually singular measures , derived from the subtractive euclidean algorithm .",
    "the latter two papers are very interesting and promising , and the author of this article does intend to generalize the results about @xmath13 to the whole family @xmath52 , @xmath53 .      recently , calkin and wilf @xcite ( re-)defined a binary tree which is generated by the iteration @xmath54 starting from the root @xmath55 ( this tree is a permutation of the well - known stern - brocot tree ) .",
    "elementary considerations show that this tree contains any positive rational number once and only once , each represented in lowest terms @xcite .",

    "we denote this tree by @xmath60 , and its @xmath46th generation by @xmath61 . the limitation of this tree to the interval @xmath62 $ ] is the well - known farey tree ( albeit with different order ) .",

    "the sequence satisfies the remarkable iteration discovered by m. newman @xcite : @xmath65 + 1-x_n),\\ ] ] thus giving an example of a simple recurrence which produces all positive rationals , and answering affirmatively to a question by d.e .",
    "the @xmath46th generation of @xmath60 consists of exactly those rational numbers whose elements of the continued fraction sum up to @xmath46 ; this observation is due to stern @xcite .",
    "indeed , this can be easily inherited directly from the definition .",

    "second , the map @xmath70 maps @xmath66 to @xmath71 $ ] in case @xmath72 , and to @xmath73 $ ] in case @xmath74 .",
    "this simple fact is of utmost importance in our work : though it is not used in explicit form , this highly motivates the investigations of moments @xmath75 and @xmath76 , given by ( [ cont ] ) . the sequence of numerators of the calkin - wilf tree @xmath77 is called the stern diatomic sequence @xcite , @xcite and it satisfies the recurrence relations @xmath78 in the next section we will show that each generation of the calkin - wilf tree possesses a distribution function @xmath79 , and @xmath79 converges uniformly to @xmath13 .",
    "this is by far not a new fact .",
    "nevertheless , we include the short proof of it for the sake of self - containedness .",
    "the function @xmath13 , as a distribution function , is uniquely determined by the functional equation ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "this implies the explicit expression ( [ min ] ) and the symmetry property @xmath80 .",

    "we will obtain this result using quite a different method .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a different treatment of minkowski s @xmath0 .",
    "all papers so far were concerned with @xmath13 as the function _ per se .",
    "_ nevertheless , it appears that there exist several natural integral transforms of @xmath13 , which are analytic functions and which encode certain substantial ( in fact , all ) information about the question mark function .",
    "each of these transforms is characterized by regularity properties and a functional equation .",
    "lastly and most importantly , let us point out that , surprisingly , there are striking similarities and analogies between the results proved here as well as in @xcite , @xcite with lewis-zagier s @xcite results on period functions for maass wave forms . that work is an expanded and clarified exposition of an earlier paper by lewis @xcite .",
    "the concise exposition of these objects , their properties and relations to selberg zeta function can be found in @xcite .",
    "the reader is strongly urged to compare results in this work with those in @xcite .",
    "let , for example , @xmath82 be a maass wave form for @xmath83 with spectral parameter @xmath84 .",
    "the similarity arises due to the fact that the limit value of @xmath82 on the real line , given by @xmath85 as @xmath86 , satisfies ( formal ) functional equations @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thus , these are completely analogous to the functional equations for @xmath13 , save the fact that @xmath89 is only a formal function - it is a distribution ( e.g. a continuous functional in properly defined space of functions ) .",
    "thus , our objects @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are analogues of objects @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively ( see section 2 of this work and @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that in fact @xmath96functions attached to maass wave forms also do have an analogue in context of the minkowski question mark function .",
    "+ this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we demonstrate some elementary properties of the distribution function @xmath13 .",
    "since the existence of all moments is guaranteed by the exponential decay of the tail , our main object is the generating function of moments , denoted by @xmath90 . in section 3",
    "we prove two functional equations for @xmath90 . in section 4",
    "we demonstrate the uniqueness of solution of this functional equation ( subject to regularity conditions ) .",
    "surprisingly , the eisenstein series @xmath3 appears on the stage . in section 5",
    "we prove the integral equation for the exponential generating function . in section 6 a new class of functions emerging from eigenfunctions of a hilbert - schmidt operator ( we call them `` dyadic eigenfunctions '' )",

    "we describe @xmath2adic distribution of rationals in the calkin - wilf tree . in the final section",
    "some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the following proposition was proved by many authors in various forms , concerning ( very related ) stern - brocot , farey or calkin - wilf trees , and this seems to be a well - known fact about a distribution of rationals in these trees . for the sake of completeness we present a short proof , since the functional equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see sections 3 and 5 ) heavily depend on the functional equation for @xmath13 and are in fact reformulations of these in different terms .
