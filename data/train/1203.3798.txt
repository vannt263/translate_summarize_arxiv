    "the most common conceptual approach to evaluate the total electrostatic potential energy stored in a dielectric containing free point charges is the method of charge assembly .",
    "textbook treatments@xcite replace discrete point charges within a dielectric with a continuous free charge density , @xmath4 .",
    "energy stored in a dielectric containing @xmath4 is easily evaluated by integration over the volume of the dielectric in which the smallest increment of charge , @xmath5 , is zero . though this is a reasonable approximation when @xmath4 consists of a large number of point charges,@xcite it fails to reflect the physical nature of point charge configurations commonly found in nanoscale systems today . moreover",
    ", the imposition of a _ continuous _ charge density prohibits the practical formation of any realistic charge distributions composed of infinitesimal , non - existent charge increments .",
    "the present model is set apart from these approaches in that a summation of interaction terms is obtained rather than integral approximations based on the interaction of @xmath4 with a macroscopic total potential , @xmath6,@xcite    @xmath7    or an electric field formulation,@xcite",
    "@xmath8    the objective of the present model is to account for the interaction of each new point charge to the system with the sum of all electrostatic potentials due to every pre - existing charge and charges formed during the assembly process without assumption of an infinitesimal charge increment , @xmath5 , to reflect the natural existence of a fundamental charge increment , @xmath9 .",
    "the discrete charge dielectric model has been used for numerical evaluations in recent studies concerning the capacitance of few - electron spherical quantum dots@xcite and `` meta - atoms''@xcite , cited as leading to charge carrier localization near quantum dot surfaces@xcite and played a central role in the discovery of a classical electrostatic fingerprint of atomic structure.@xcite the present model represents a redevelopment and generalization of a previously published interactions picture initially used to evaluate the electrostatic energy of a silicon sphere containing one or two electrons embedded in a uniform silicon dioxide environment.@xcite exclusion of one - half of the `` self - polarization '' interaction energy term in the original picture is shown to be inconsistent with the current formulation in which a more appropriate description , `` direct polarization , '' is used to both eliminate confusion with self - interaction or self energy  interaction of a point charge with its own potential  and to differentiate it from indirect polarization interactions ( `` polarizations '' in the original picture ) which are not directly involved in the polarization of the dielectric .",
    "a practical definition of stored energy is that delivered to the system by an external agent acting on point charges during assembly and must be equal to that recovered by an external conservative energy source when the system is dismantled .",
    "this is necessary such that the dielectric is returned to its original , neutral state .",
    "the amount of energy displaced by polarization of atomic or molecular constituents of the dielectric must likewise be restored to its _ internal _ conservative energy source ( atoms or molecules ) but does not contribute to the energy stored in the system as it already exists within it .    in the following , the electrostatic interaction between two point charges of like sign is carefully described .",
    "seemingly trivial , the development is exceedingly instructive toward a physical intuition and constructs a framework in which the other types of interaction are developed .",
    "this approach identifies the mutual distribution of interaction energy between charges and categorizes interactions as directly resulting from work done by an external agent or a response of charges already in the system to new charge arrivals .",
    "the electrostatic constraint of a single point charge to a dielectric object is examined .",
    "formation of a bound surface charge element at the dielectric interface is the result of direct polarization , an example of the charged system s response to a newly introduced point charge . in the process of introducing a second point charge to the system ,",
    "the point charges interact directly with each other , and a new bound surface charge is formed by direct polarization . additionally , the external agent must do work on the new point charge against the electrostatic potential due to the bound surface charge element formed exclusively by the first point charge",
    ". this represents an indirect polarization in which energy is mutually shared between the two point charges as the first point charge is likewise subjected to the potential due to the additional bound surface charge element formed by the second point charge .",
    "the latter interaction is a necessary response to the formation of an additional bound charge .",
    "the energy associated with this response can only derive from work done by the external agent .",
    "for completeness , interactions among bound charges are arguably intrinsic to the system and have no direct source of energy as may only be supplied by the external agent .",
    "these interactions are therefore explicitly taken into account within the framework of the discrete charge dielectric model during assembly .    for few - electron systems commonly found in nanoscale studies",
    "the generalized summation expression differs from eqs .",
    "[ eq : lafave - rhophi ] and [ eq : lafave - edotd ] by up to a factor of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this result is not unexpected as it is consistent with a similar charge - by - charge derivation@xcite of the so - called `` quantum '' capacitance expression , @xmath12 , which differs from the familiar `` classical '' capacitance expression , @xmath13 , by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "similarly , a @xmath10 capacitance disparity between `` open '' ( isolated ) and `` closed '' ( connected ) single electron devices is known.@xcite the sources of these disparities are discussed and represent one - half the total direct polarization energy in the present model .    in the other extreme ,",
    "as @xmath1 grows large , the direct polarization energy term becomes a negligible fraction of the total energy as required for the approximation of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the discrete charge dielectric model is applicable to nanoscale systems in which the behavior of few free electrons dominates the electronic properties of a material , as well as many - electron systems limited by computing capacity and other practical considerations .",

    "a point charge , @xmath23 , interacting with its own electrostatic potential ,    @xmath24    at its location , @xmath21 , is infinite in magnitude .",
    "this self - interaction energy is excluded from evaluation of the total stored energy as the external agent is not involved .      to evaluate the `` coulomb interaction''@xcite energy between @xmath25 and @xmath26 in free space having the same sign consider an external agent acting on @xmath26 in the direction of @xmath25 . as @xmath26 approaches @xmath25 retreats to infinity as there are no physical constraints acting on it .",
    "if there are physical constraints , an evaluation of the energy associated with the constraining forces must be made .",
    "this concept is central to the discrete charge dielectric model , and dismisses the unnecessary prescription of an initially `` fixed '' charge configuration conventionally implied in the electrostatics literature .",
