    "the mass density in the central regions of galaxy clusters typically exceeds the critical value required for lensing , generating multiple - images of background objects .",
    "this phenomenon is known as strong - lensing ( sl ) and the background sources are usually very distant field galaxies , lensed into magnified and often multiple arcs on the lens plane .",
    "recent analyses have shown that many sets of multiply - lensed images can be uncovered with high - quality space imaging measurements and improved modelling techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a background cluster is of practical interest .",
    "an initial estimate of the possibility of observing cluster - cluster lensing ( ccl ) was made by @xcite , who predicted that a few dozen ccls may be observed over the full sky .",
    "soon thereafter , two such lenses were discovered .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the nearby supercluster a2152 ( @xmath3 ) is actually a chance alignment of two clusters : a2152 , and a more massive background cluster at @xmath4 ( which was then designated a2152-b ) .",
    "the centres of these two clusters are separated by 2.4@xmath5 , and some background cluster galaxies of the more distant cluster seem magnified and distorted in the image - plane of a2152 . @xcite",
    "have shown that an excess of distant galaxies in the south - west area of ms 1008 - 1224 is most likely also a weaker lensing effect of a background cluster near the line of sight .",
    "there seem to be no other explicit cases of ccls reported to date .",
    "@xcite have also investigated the properties of a `` double lens '' configuration , and mainly its effect on wl analyses . in this context , the effect of interest is the lensing of a background source by two ( at least partially ) aligned lenses , where several such configurations were suggested or theoretically discussed before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "major advances in the capability of detecting weak low - brightness emission in the optical and x - ray regions , and more recently also in sz mapping of many clusters , together with increased precision in the values of the cosmological parameters , make the ( strong ) ccl phenomenon of practical interest as a probe of cluster properties .",
    "additionally , the statistics of ccls enhances the use of clusters as probes of the evolution of the large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the manifestation of sl in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum secures the identification of ccls .",
    "contrasting the results from a search of ccls with theoretical predictions may yield important new insight , especially on the late evolution of the lss .",
    "we briefly describe the possible observational signatures of ccls in the optical , x - ray and sz , and carry out a detailed calculation of the expected numbers of ccls in several cosmological models using current values of the global and cluster parameters .",
    "our updated treatment here ( for previous calculation see @xcite ) yields a wide range of values for the predicted numbers of ccls , reflecting modelling and observational uncertainties .",
    "additionally , we report a ( possible ) discovery of another moderately - lensed ( magnified by @xmath6 ; see  [ 383 ] ) , high-@xmath2 background cluster at @xmath7 behind a383 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 from its centre , as seen in figure [ cc383 ] .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we discuss the observational properties of ccl . in ",
    "3 we present our calculation of the probability for ccls and their predicted numbers .",
    "the possible detection of a ccl in the field of a383 is discussed in  4 .",
    "our main results are summarized in  5 .",
    "lensing of a background cluster results in magnified optical images of the background cluster galaxies , and in hitherto undetected signatures in the x - ray and microwave regions . in the image plane , a clear local overdensity of magnified , distorted , and stretched optical images would generally be expected when the galaxies of a background cluster are lensed .",
    "the higher redshift of the background cluster should result in images fainter by the luminosity distance ratio ( relative to the lensing cluster ) , but boosted by the magnification effect which though preserves surface brightness , will magnify the total flux ( due to the increased area occupied by each source in the image - plane ) . also , when having multi - band imaging , the higher redshift of the background cluster will cause the background galaxies to look redder relative to the lens red - sequence galaxies ( see figure [ cc383 ] ) , though this effect might not be prominent in a simple rgb colour - composite image when redshift differences are relatively small ( and further weakened by the butcher - oemler effect ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and in such a case are more likely to be revealed by producing photometric catalogues which may exhibit a different , secondary red - sequence corresponding to the background cluster .",
    "the steep dependence of the x - ray surface brightness on redshift would generally mean that , even though magnified by the foreground cluster , the background cluster will at best look as a faint part of the foreground cluster emission .",
    "if the background cluster lies further away from the line of sight , there might be a traceable signature , as the magnified background flux will be seen far enough from the foreground cluster centre , where the foreground flux is lower and thus might enable a clear detection , but only if the background cluster is sufficiently luminous .",
    "we note , however , that in the strong regime this may resemble x - ray images of a substructure , merger , or related shocks , and thus without additional information , even if such a signal is detected it could well be miss - interpreted .",
    "in addition ( as was noted previously by @xcite ) , x - ray spectra can be used to determine the background cluster redshift , particularly by the measurement of the relatively strong fe lines .",
    "current measurement capabilities ( e.g , with _ chandra _ ) enable determining the cluster redshift up to @xmath10 . still , it might not be feasible to detect a ccl based solely on x - ray imaging measurements .",
    "the sz effect is the change in the cmb intensity due to compton scattering of cmb photons as they traverse intracluster gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the result is a redshift - independent distortion of the cmb spectrum , whose thermal component constitutes a decrement of cmb spectrum below @xmath11  ghz , and an increment of the spectrum above @xmath11  ghz .",
    "the sz effect is measured with respect to the unscattered cmb at the location of the cluster , so lensing affects the sz signal similarly at all observed frequencies .",
    "the total observed sz signal is therefore a sum of the intrinsic sz signal from the lensed cluster , which is then magnified by the foreground cluster , plus the sz signal due to scattering in the foreground cluster .",
    "the fact that the sz effect is independent of redshift may help in making the identification of a ccl more feasible in sz surveys than in x - ray surveys .",
    "however , it may still be hard to disentangle the signals of the foreground and background structures , as the sz signal usually stretches out to large ( projected ) distances and may thus cover - up lensed features .",
    "the net result from such a trade - off will depend on the lens and source redshifts , and on the projected distance of the lensed feature from the line - of - sight of the lensing cluster , so that generally , structures closer to the line - of - sight will be more strongly lensed and magnified , but the relative flux from the foreground cluster will also be higher . as in the x - ray ,",
    "also here strong ccl may resemble images of merger , or related shocks .",
    "obviously , a ccl identification can be more secure if lensing features are revealed in both x - ray and sz measurements , or if clearly detected in optical imaging measurements .",
    "with photometric and/or spectroscopic data , such a detection could yield precise information on both clusters .",
    "in  4 we elaborate further on the lensing signatures in the optical , x - ray and sz regions , as manifested in a383 , which seems to be moderately lensing a background cluster .",
    "in order to assess the probability for ccls we integrate the mass function over two cluster populations , namely those of the lenses and sources .",
    "we do so for both the @xcite mass function ( hereafter ps ) , and that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter st ) . for each cluster of the lens population",
    "we integrate the mass function of sources lying behind the lens , and included within the einstein radius , as ( properly ) determined by the source and lens redshifts . the volume element over which the source integration is carried out",
    "is computed in terms of the solid angle defined by the einstein ring in the plane of the lens , projected onto the source redshift , by means of the ratio of the squared lens - source angular diameter distances .",
    "integrating over the lens population then yields the desired number of ccls .",
    "note that we include in this estimate only sources that are fully enclosed within the respective einstein radius , ignoring a partial alignment of the source within this radius . in this regard our estimate constitutes a lower limit on the number of ccls .",
    "the equation governing the relation between the concentration parameter and the einstein radius assuming an nfw profile @xcite is , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the overdensity at virialisation and critical density at redshift @xmath2 , respectively , @xmath15 is the critical surface density , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source distances , respectively , and @xmath19^{1/3 } mpc\\cdot h^{-1},\\ ] ] is the virial radius .",
    "also , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the einstein radius , and @xmath22    the concentration parameter @xmath23 scales with mass and redshift according to the following relation : @xmath24 where the parameters a , b , c and @xmath25 are taken from various c - m relations as we discuss below .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gx ] ) provides the einstein radius as a function of @xmath23 , from which the angular einstein radius @xmath26 , the ratio between the ( physical ) einstein radius and the angular diameter distance to the lens , can be readily determined .    having solved for the angular einstein radius at the lens",
    ", we can now estimate the number of source clusters that would undergo lensing , i.e. the ones lying behind the lens and included within the angular area subtended by the einstein radius .",
    "for this purpose we set the lens mass and redshift , and integrate the mass function over the relevant mass range , a volume element defined by the source - cluster redshift , @xmath27 , and the angular diameter element specified by the einstein radius of the lens - source system , projected onto the source redshift by means of the squared lens - source angular diameter distance ratio , @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this result provides the number of lensed sources behind a lens lying at redshift @xmath29 , and having a mass @xmath30 .",
    "the total number of ccl occurrences is likewise estimated by integrating the mass function over the mass - redshift space of the lens :    @xmath31    . the corresponding source - plane volume element is denoted in purple .",
    "note that by virtue of the low angular scales involved , one can safely use the flat sky approximation to calculate the volume element at the source redshift.,width=302 ]      as is obvious , results depend significantly on the mass function , and quite strongly on the c - m relation .",
    "this relation is only roughly estimated from numerical simulations of clusters ; therefore , it introduces a large uncertainty in the predicted numbers of ccls .",
    "we have used the ps and st mass functions and various c - m relations , each specified in terms of a different set of a , b , c and @xmath25 parameters ( in eq . [ cm ] ) .",
    "we first use the notation and parameters given in @xcite , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite . in this notation @xmath32",

    "as taken from wmap7 results , the above parameters for the c - m relation , and clusters in the mass interval , @xmath41 - @xmath42 our calculations yield @xmath43 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath44 ccls with a st mass function .",
    "when taking into account also background groups of galaxies down to @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath44 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath46 ccls with the st mass function .",
    "we repeated the calculation with the c - m relation given by @xcite for their full sample , in which @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . with these values , for a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath51 taken from wmap5 results ( as used in duffy et al .",

    "when taking into account also background groups of galaxies down to @xmath45 , our calculations yield @xmath54 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath55 with a st mass function .",
    "we note that the c - m relation presented in @xcite yields similar results .    in order to take into account the lensing projection bias of triaxial cluster morphology",
    ", the calculation was repeated with the c - m relation of @xcite , in which @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath39 .    for these values , in @xmath0cdm model with @xmath59 taken from wmap5 results , and mass limits of @xmath41 - @xmath42 ,",
    "our calculations yield @xmath60 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath61 ccls with a st mass function .",
    "when taking into account also background groups of galaxies down to @xmath45 , we predict @xmath62 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath63 ccls with a st mass function .",
    "thus , taking into account the lensing projection bias boosts ccl numbers by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we compare these results to the observed c - m relation from a small sample of 10 clusters derived by @xcite , in which @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath49 , and @xmath39 . this relation yields concentrations higher than predicted by @xmath0cdm simulations , and even higher than those derived observationally by previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are likely to be extreme results that are perhaps less relevant for our purposes .    assuming these values , in @xmath0cdm with @xmath66 taken from wmap5 results , and mass limits of @xmath41 - @xmath42 , our calculations yield @xmath67 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath68 ccls with a st mass function .",
    "when taking into account also background groups of galaxies down to @xmath45 , our calculations yield @xmath69 ccls with a ps mass function , and @xmath70 ccls with a st mass function . thus , according to the observed relation ( which is known to produce higher concentration than @xmath0cdm simulations ) the predicted total numbers of ccls are quite large .",
    "it should be noted that taking into account the weak lensing regime , in which the background cluster does not have to be within the einstein radius as projected onto the source plane , but can be further out up to several einstein radii , the likelihood of a ccl increases significantly . specifically , still assuming the flat sky approximation , the likelihood of a ccl increases simply as the square of the ratio of the projected distance of the background cluster and the einstein radius of the foreground cluster .",
    "moreover , extending the calculations to the 1@xmath71 ranges of the @xmath0cdm parameters broadens the ranges of our predicted numbers of ccls by up to a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the use of other mass functions - such as @xcite or @xcite - can introduce another @xmath7320% variation .",
    "in the course of this work we inspected ( among other clusters ) deep archival multiband images of a383 obtained with the suprimecam on the subaru telescope @xcite in 2002,2005,2007,2008 and new data collected in 2010 dedicated to the clash sample ( @xcite ; see also below ) , with total integration times of at least @xmath52hr and up to @xmath74hr , for each of the b , v , rc , ic , i,z bands .",
    "our analysis indicates that this is possibly a new example of a ccl , with the lensed system being either a background cluster or a group of galaxies .",
    "standard image reduction was performed with _ mscred _ task in iraf , while coadded images were created following @xcite .",

    "our bpz @xcite photometric catalogue , based on the 6 subaru imaging bands mentioned above , suggests redshifts of @xmath79 and @xmath80 for these structures , respectively , which further reduces their expected magnification by a383 to @xmath81 .",

    "a383 is one of 25 clusters covered in the clash multi - cycle treasury program .",
    "the clash program has been awarded 524 orbits of hst time to conduct a multi - cycle program that will couple the gravitational - lensing power of 25 massive intermediate redshift clusters with hst s newly enhanced panchromatic imaging capabilities ( wfc3 and the restored acs ) , in order to test structure formation models with unprecedented precision .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    to further base the results of this work , and in the framework of the clash collaboration , we have constructed strong and weak lensing ( wl ) models for this field ( respectively , @xcite , umetsu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "interestingly , the different background structures are seen in the wide - field wl analysis , which we use to derive a magnification of @xmath6 at the location of the lensed cluster discussed here .",
    "we note that this cluster is @xmath86 einstein radii away from the centre of a383 , therefore the sl model can not be used for the magnification estimate , but only to check consistency with our wl analysis of a383 in the region of overlap ( around 0.7 - 1 arcminute in radius ; see figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted , that these higher-@xmath2 structures are deduced in both 1d and 2d wl analyses , even though different approaches are employed in these . in the 1d analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "such background structures are seen in the shape of `` dips '' in the tangential shear profile , and translate to local mass excess in the lens convergence ( @xmath87 ) profile ( see @xcite ; see also @xcite , figure 5 ) . in the 2d wl analysis presented here , these will simply be seen as 2d structures in the mass distribution , as can be seen in figure [ cc383wl ]",
    ".    note also that the detection here is based on the optical data , meaning that the lensed cluster is clearly seen , and not by other means which later need further verification .    in order to calculate , or",
    "put limits on the background cluster mass , we first examine the total light by this cluster .",

    "next , we perform a 2d gravitational shear analysis of subaru multiband ( @xmath97 ) data ( see zitrin et al",
    ". 2011b on a383 ) to constrain the mass distribution of the @xmath98 cluster .",

    "from a photometric - redshift ( @xmath99 ) selected sample of background galaxies ( @xmath100 , @xmath101ab mag ) , we construct a spin-2 reduced - shear field on a regular grid of @xmath102 independent pixels , covering a @xmath103 region centred on a383 .",

    "however , even in extreme cases the bias is @xmath111% of the cluster peak - height , which is negligible compared to our measurement noise for the @xmath98 cluster .    in order to estimate the sz signal from the @xmath98 cluster , we first subtracted our best - fit model of a383 from our unbiased sz image .",
    "we then computed the integrated projected sz signal within a 1  mpc aperture ( 2.14  arcmin ) centred on the @xmath98 cluster , and found @xmath112  ster , with a statistical error of @xmath113  ster . restricting to physically allowed positive values of @xmath114 , this results in a 95% confidence level upper limit of @xmath115  ster .",

    "while inspecting lensing measurements of a sample of clusters we have noticed a lensed background clustering structure behind a383 ( @xmath8 ) , in deep subaru imaging .",
    "photometric redshifts imply this overdensity is at @xmath7 , and is clearly seen redder in an rgb colour image , and very faint in the b band .",
    "our wl modelling of a383 implies a magnification of @xmath134 of this background cluster .",
    "accounting for this correction , the total b - band source luminosity is @xmath135 summed over all 40 members , which is translated into a lower - limit mass estimate of @xmath136 , using a typical m / l ratio of @xmath137 .",
    "we have also analysed sz and x - ray data , and independent wl measurements , to obtain mass estimates of @xmath122  m@xmath120 , @xmath126 ( 95% cl upper limits ) and @xmath138 ( or a projected mass @xmath139 ) , respectively .",
    "these are commensurate with our prior estimate based on the luminosity .",
    "these are also in agreement with the fact that no excess emission is seen in the sz or x - ray images of a383 at the location of the background cluster ( see figure [ xray383 ] ) , reflecting its probable low mass .",
    "deeper images in the different spectral regions would be of interest to examine further the possibility that this cluster is a ccl , along with spectroscopic data for measuring the exact background cluster redshift .",
    "in addition , future detections of ccls are important , as their overall number could probe the lss parameters , the cluster ( and group ) mass function , and the c - m relation .",
