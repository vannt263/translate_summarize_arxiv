    "the hadroproduction of the top quark plays a crucial role in testing the standard model ( sm ) as well as for searches for new physics .",
    "the properties of the top quark , such as its mass , production cross sections , decay rates , and its charge asymmetries , have been measured at both the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the experimental data are generally compatible with the sm predictions ; however , the predictions for the top quark forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath14 at the tevatron are in substantial disagreement with the experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one uses conventional scale setting , i.e. , guessing the renormalization scale and its range , the predicted @xmath15 forward - backward asymmetry deviates significantly from the tevatron cdf and d0 measurements  @xcite .",
    "the difference between theory and experiment ranges up to a @xmath16 standard deviation for a @xmath15 invariant mass @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to understand the origin of this discrepancy  is it new physics or an artifact of the calculational method ?",
    "we have shown that the large discrepancies for the top - quark charge asymmetry with pqcd predictions observed at the tevatron can be attributed to an improper choice of the renormalization scale  @xcite . in the conventional procedure ,",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath18 is fixed at the value @xmath19 , which is usually chosen as @xmath20 in order to eliminate the large logarithmic terms @xmath21 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this procedure for setting the renormalization scale and its range is only a guess ; in fact , the resulting predictions are scheme dependent , violating renormalization group invariance . in the case of its qed analog , the @xmath22 charge asymmetry in @xmath23 , this method disagrees with the standard gell mann - low method for scale setting , where the renormalization scale is set by the photon virtuality  @xcite",
    "; in fact , a new renormalization scale and effective number of leptons @xmath24 appears at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "the conventional procedure of guessing the renormalization scale and its range in pqcd results in an unnecessary systematic error for @xmath15-pair production , and it can even lead to incorrect finite - order predictions .",
    "renormalization group invariance implies that the prediction for a physical observable can not depend on the choice of the initial renormalization scale  @xcite or the choice of the renormalization scheme .",
    "the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) provides a systematic and unambiguous way to set the renormalization scale and to eliminate the renormalization scheme and scale uncertainty for _ fixed - order pqcd predictions _  @xcite .",
    "the running behavior of the qcd coupling constant is governed by the @xmath25-function of its renormalization group equation .",
    "the guiding principle of the pmc is that all terms proportional to the qcd @xmath25-functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 should be resummed into the running coupling ; this procedure determines the correct renormalization scale and the effective number of quark flavors at each perturbative order .",
    "the resulting pqcd series then has the same coefficients of the @xmath30  conformal \" series which is renormalization - scheme independent . in the @xmath31 abelian limit",
    "@xcite , this procedure agrees with gell mann - low scale setting .",
    "one can also use the pmc to derive  commensurate scale relations \"  @xcite such as the  generalized crewther relation \"  @xcite which relate observables to each other independent of the choice of renormalization scheme .    after applying the pmc ,",
    "we obtain the optimal scale of the process at each order in pqcd , and the resulting theoretical predictions are essentially free of initial scale dependence .",
    "furthermore , the divergent renormalon series do not appear in the pmc prediction , and the pqcd convergence is generally greatly improved .",
    "the pmc provides the underlying principle for the well - known brodsky - lepage - mackenzie scheme  @xcite , and it is applicable at all orders in pqcd .",
    "some recent higher order pmc applications can be found in refs .",
    "in particular , we have shown that after applying the pmc , the sm predictions for the top - quark charge asymmetry at the tevatron have only @xmath32 deviation from the cdf and d0 measurements  @xcite ; the large discrepancies of the top - quark charge asymmetry between the sm estimate and the data are thus greatly reduced .",
    "the top - quark charge asymmetry at the lhc for the @xmath33 process is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the difference between the absolute rapidity of the top and anti - top quarks , and @xmath36 is the number of events .",
    "measurements of the top - quark charge asymmetry at the lhc have been reported in refs .",
    "the recent preliminary atlas+cms measurements give @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the tevatron @xmath38 processes , the asymmetric channel @xmath39 provides a small pqcd contribution to the top - pair production at the lhc , and the symmetric channel @xmath40 provides the dominant contribution .",
    "thus , the predicted charge asymmetry at the lhc is usually smaller than the one at the tevatron .",
    "two typical sm predictions for the charge asymmetry at the lhc are : @xmath41 and @xmath42 for ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 for ref .",
    "the uncertainties of those two sm predictions are the scale errors obtained by using the conventional renormalization scale and range , @xmath45 $ ] , and by fixing the factorization scale @xmath46 .",
    "thus if one uses conventional scale setting , the resulting scale uncertainties provide the dominant error for the pqcd prediction .",
    "in this paper we shall apply the pmc to predict the top - quark charge asymmetry at the lhc based on the analysis of the top - pair hadroproduction up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) level .",
    "it is found that a more accurate top - quark asymmetry with less scale uncertainties can be achieved .",
    "we shall show that the pmc predictions are in agreement with the available atlas and cms data within errors ; since the renormalization scale uncertainties are essentially eliminated , the constraints on new beyond the standard model physics are considerably strengthened .",
    "the remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we present the calculational technology for applying pmc scale setting to the top - quark charge asymmetries at the lhc .",
    "the bernreuther - si ( bs ) program  @xcite for doing the nnlo qcd corrections , together with the electroweak corrections , are adopted for our present purposes .",

    "[ sect3 ] . a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] .",
    "we applied pmc scale setting to determine the renormalization scales for the top - pair hadroproduction cross sections at the tevatron in refs .",
    "@xcite . for self - consistency , we shall present the main formulas here ; interested readers may turn to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis .",
    "we shall then apply the same technology to deal with the top - quark charge asymmetry at the lhc .",
    "total hadronic cross section for the top - quark pair production , @xmath47 , can be obtained from the convolution of the factorized partonic cross - section @xmath48 with the parton luminosities @xmath49 @xmath50 with the parton luminosity @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 denotes the hadronic center - of - mass ( cm ) energy squared and @xmath55 is the subprocess center - of - mass energy squared .",

    "we will refer to @xmath63 as the asymmetry under the conventional scale setting by using the bs - program  @xcite .",
    "when one uses conventional scale setting , the @xmath64 term and the @xmath65 term have the same importance .",
    "since the nnlo @xmath65 term is not available at present , one then has to use the lowest - order @xmath66 cross - section in the denominator and the @xmath67 term in the numerator ; i.e. , one can only address the ",
    "lo asymmetry \" , @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , we will show that , after pmc scale setting , the size of the nnlo corrections for both the total cross - sections and the asymmetry are decreased by about one order of magnitude .",

    ". these terms can be obtained from refs.@xcite , or they can be numerically calculated using the bs program  @xcite .    in order to compare the pmc prediction with the asymmetry assuming conventional scale setting @xmath63 , we will rewrite the pmc asymmetry @xmath78 as  @xcite    @xmath79    where the symbol",

    "in addition , we have defined an effective coupling constant @xmath84 for the asymmetric part of the qcd contributions , which is the weighted average of the strong coupling constant for the asymmetric @xmath85-channel  @xcite ; i.e. , in using the effective coupling constant @xmath86 , one obtains the same @xmath85-channel nlo cross section as that obtained from @xmath87 .",
    "we take the top quark mass @xmath88 gev and the pdf as cteq6.6 m  @xcite .",
    "we shall use the bs program  @xcite to do our calculation , and as a cross check , we also adopt the hathor program  @xcite to calculate the total cross - sections . taking the same input parameters in these two programs",

    "the asymmetries have much smaller scale dependence ; the resulting predictions are also in better agreement with the available atlas and cms data within errors . at present",
    "the lhc measurements still have large errors ; the comparison of the predicted asymmetry with future more accurate data will improve our understandings on the top - quark asymmetry .",
    "it is often argued that by varying the renormalization scale within a certain region , one can predict unknown higher - order contributions .",

    "the pmc series is identical to the corresponding conformal series ; the divergent renormalon terms are absent .",
    "after pmc scale setting , the scales are optimized at each order of perturbation theory and can not be varied ; otherwise , one explicitly breaks the renormalization group invariance , which then leads to an unreliable prediction .",
    "a conservative way to predict the unknown higher - order contributions after pmc scale setting has been suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of the predicted unknown higher - orders contributions using various renormalization scale settings has been given in ref .",
    "two observables @xmath94 and @xmath95 are studied up to four - loop level  @xcite . the figures ( 4,5 ) in this reference show that the error bars from  unknown \" higher - order corrections quickly approach a stable values when one applies pmc scale setting in strong contrast to conventional scale setting .",
    "the values for the  unknown \" higher - order terms are well within the error bars predicted from the corresponding one - order lower terms .",
    "we have also calculated the top - quark charge asymmetries assuming several typical invariant top - pair invariant mass cuts .",
    "table [ tabacmtt ] shows that after applying the pmc , the asymmetry @xmath96 decreases with increasing @xmath97 .",
    "the difference in predicted asymmetries between pmc and convention scale setting again shows that the proper choice of renormalization scale is essential .      *",
    "a demonstration of the renormalization scheme dependence of pqcd predictions has been done in refs.@xcite by introducing a generalized @xmath98-like renormalization scheme with an arbitrary subtraction constant @xmath99 at each order ; i.e. , the @xmath100-scheme . the @xmath100-scheme provides a systematic , process - independent way to identify the @xmath101 terms at each perturbative order .",
    "the resulting  degeneracy relations \" , achieved by setting @xmath102 in eq.(4 ) of ref.@xcite , demonstrates that the scheme - independent conformal terms are the same for any @xmath98-like renormalization scheme .",
    "the pmc predictions for physical observables are independent of the choice of renormalization scheme . *",
    "the pmc provides a process - independent way to absorb all @xmath25-terms into the running coupling , consistent with its renormalization group equation .",
