    "the @xmath6 also shows a breit - wigner resonance when the direct tunneling is broken and a fano type when direct tunneling is increased .",

    "the fano parameter @xmath9 , generally a complex number , decides the line shape of the resonance .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to study how the josephson current is affected by the interference of the two paths , and whether the josephson current also has the fano characters as in normal systems .",
    "recently , the josephson current through a mesoscopic system has been extensively investigated because of scientific interest and possible applications .",
    "the josephson current through a clean thin superconductor - normal - superconductor ( s - n - s ) junction has a discontinuous jump at superconductor phase difference @xmath14 under proper conditions.@xcite this current jump arises from the discontinuity of supercurrent contribution of andreev bound - states driven by phase difference @xmath15 of coupled leads.@xcite in this situation , the current jump can be broken by impurities,@xcite the finite temperature , the normal lead attachment,@xcite or the electron - electron interaction.@xcite another interesting characteristic of the josephson current is the @xmath1 junction , where the sign of josephson current can be reversed from @xmath16 to @xmath17.@xcite the @xmath1 junction is broadly researched in s - ferromagnetic - s ( s - f - s ) junctions,@xcite s - f ring@xcite , s - qd - s junctions,@xcite s - ab - s junctions,@xcite and so on.@xcite    in this paper , we will investigate the josephson current @xmath3 through an ab - fano interferometer consisting of a qd in one arm and a magnetic flux @xmath0 through the ring . by using the non - equilibrium green s function method ,",

    "<S> the josephson current through an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer , in which a quantum dot ( qd ) is situated on one arm and a magnetic flux @xmath0 threads through the ring , has been investigated . with the existence of the magnetic flux , the relation of the josephson current and the superconductor phase is complex , and the system can be adjusted to @xmath1 junction by either modulating the magnetic flux or the qd s energy level @xmath2 . due to the electron - hole symmetry , the josephson current @xmath3 has the property @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson current exhibits a jump when a pair of andreev bound states aligns with the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the current jump is given . </S>",
    "<S> in particularly , we find that the position of the current jump and the position of the maximum value of the critical current @xmath5 are identical . due to the interference between the two paths , the critical current @xmath5 versus the qd s level @xmath2 shows a typical fano shape , which is similar to the fano effect in the corresponding normal device . </S>",
    "<S> but they also show some differences . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the critical current never reaches zero for any parameters , while the current in the normal device can reach zero at the destruction point . </S>"
