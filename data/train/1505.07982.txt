    "diffraction methods are essential tools .",
    "the method of electron backscatter diffraction ( ebsd ) is based on the measurement of kikuchi patterns @xcite which appear in the angular distribution of backscattered electrons ( bse ) in the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) . in the context of the ebsd method ,",
    "these patterns are also called electron backscatter diffraction patterns ( ebsp ) , or backscattered kikuchi patterns ( bkp ) with the extension to transmission kikuchi diffraction ( tkd ) in the sem . over the last two decades",
    ", ebsd has evolved into an effective tool for microstructure investigations @xcite with a wide field of applications in orientation mapping @xcite , grain- and phase - boundary characterization , local phase identification , and lattice strain determination @xcite .",
    "because a range of physical and chemical properties of modern materials is directly affected by the crystal structure , there is an evident need for characterization techniques like ebsd which are locally sensitive to crystal symmetries on the relevant length - scales of the material s microstructure , possibly down to the nanoscale @xcite .    experimentally , ebsd is conceptually simple : in principle only a phosphor screen imaged by a sensitive ccd camera is needed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the geometry of the kikuchi patterns is governed by the gnomonic projection of the bragg reflection conditions of a point source inside a crystal @xcite . however",
    ", this does not give any information on the details of the observed intensity distribution near a kikuchi band , and the explanation of the exact physical kikuchi pattern formation process is considerably more complicated .",
    "kikuchi pattern formation is based on the concept of atomic emitters of electron waves which are incoherent with respect to the incident beam @xcite and the multiple scattering of these waves inside a crystal gives rise to the characteristic kikuchi pattern intensity distribution . because of the strong effects of multiple scattering and absorption , the quantitative calculation of the backscattered diffraction pattern has to be based on the dynamical theory of electron diffraction .",
    "[ fig : principle ]    due the increased information content which is provided by dynamical electron diffraction in ebsd kikuchi patterns , the detailed physics - based simulation and analysis of the respective effects is becoming more and more important @xcite . for example , kikuchi patterns are intrinsically sensitive to the point - group symmetry of a crystal @xcite . with the huge increase of the commonly available computing power ,",
    "it has become possible to routinely carry out quantitative simulations of high - resolution kikuchi patterns with an efficiency that now makes it possible to directly compare complete experimental kikuchi patterns with theoretical simulations .",
    "typical applications of dynamical diffraction simulations include ebsd - based lattice strain analysis @xcite , ebsd image segmentation and orientation determination @xcite , and the analysis of orientation relationships in phase transformations @xcite .",
    "with respect to non - centrosymmetric phases , point - group sensitive orientation mapping has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the range of possible applications of dynamical ebsd pattern simulations includes even space - group sensitivity , which has been demonstrated by discrimination of left - handed and right - handed quartz using ebsd kikuchi patterns @xcite .",
    "sem based diffraction can also be observed via electron channeling patterns ( ecp ) @xcite which measure kikuchi patterns of backscattered electrons resulting from the diffraction of the incident beam . due to its close relationship to ebsd",
    ", the results presented here also largely apply to ecp , which is a particularly useful method for direct imaging of dislocations in the sem @xcite .",
    "this type of application which has recently received renewed interest @xcite with decisive advances in the necessary quantitative image simulations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to give an overview of simulation approaches for kikuchi patterns and some of the underlying physical mechanisms . in this way",
    ", the present paper aims to show that ebsd ( and also ecp ) in combination with kikuchi pattern simulations provides an important tool for advanced analysis of crystalline phases in the sem .",
    "in this section we review the existing models for ebsd - related kikuchi pattern simulation in order to critically point out their specific advantages and limitations .",
    "the calculation of all the simulated kikuchi patterns was carried out using the software ( bruker nano ) which implements the bloch wave approach for ebsd pattern simulation @xcite . in detailed kikuchi pattern simulations , a typical number of about @xmath0 or more reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath1 is taken into account .",
    "these are selected according to the reciprocal lattice vector length @xmath2 ( typically @xmath3 nm@xmath4 ) and the relative strength with respect to the largest structure factor amplitude @xmath5 ( typically 15% ... 10% or less ) .",
    "the simulations presented here neglect experimental excess - deficiency effects which are related to the incident beam direction @xcite . to quantify the agreement between two kikuchi patterns , we use the normalized cross - correlation coefficient @xmath6 @xcite :    @xmath7 \\cdot \\left [ w(i , j)-\\bar{w}\\,\\right ] } { \\sqrt { \\sum\\limits_{i , j } \\left [ f(i , j)-\\bar{f } \\ , \\right ] ^2 } \\ ,",
    "\\cdot \\ ,   \\sqrt { \\sum\\limits_{i , j } \\left [ w(i , j)-\\bar{w } \\ , \\right ] ^2 } } \\ ] ]    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pixel intensity values of the corresponding regions of interest ( roi ) in the two patterns to be compared , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mean values in these rois .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath6 is in the range between 0 and 1 and does not depend on scale changes in the intensity of both patterns . from our experience ,",
    "values of @xmath12 indicate visually convincing fits between experimental and simulated values . for pattern matching or model discrimination via @xmath6 , the statistically necessary levels of @xmath6 could be lower or higher than these values , depending on the details of the application .    in the following sections we proceed to evaluate the capability of different theoretical models to describe the experimentally observed kikuchi patterns .",
    " and @xmath13 for the same experimental conditions as in fig.[fig : gap_exp].,width=264 ]    in the simplest case , the kikuchi patterns are interpreted with the help of the gnomonic projection of kossel cones @xcite which are formed by all possible directions of bragg reflection from a lattice plane with normals ( hkl ) and ( -h - k - l ) .",
    "this does not include any information about band intensities . in this model , the width of a kikuchi band is given by twice the bragg angle @xmath14 : @xmath15 in the case of ebsd the resulting bragg angle is in the order of only a few degrees because of the relative sizes of the electron wavelength @xmath16 and the unit cell dimensions .",
    "diffraction orders with @xmath17 in ( [ bragg1 ] ) describe the higher - order interferences that form additional parallel lines outside the main band . a geometrical simulation for gap displaying the kossel cone intersections of all possible bragg reflections with @xmath18 nm and @xmath13 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bragg ] ( the same beam selection criteria will be applied in all the following simulations shown here ) .",
    "while the actual agreement with the experiment is very limited , the entangled network of kossel cone projections gives a peculiarly indirect view of the structure of reciprocal space and its effects on ebsd kikuchi patterns .",
    "the most notable features are the characteristic circular areas surrounding some important zone axes like , which are related to the `` higher order laue zone '' ( holz ) rings seen also in the experimental gap pattern @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that all the reflections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bragg ] will also enter into the dynamical simulation discussed later , where the influence of each possible reflection is considered quantitatively , in contrast to the purely geometrical drawing of kossel - cone hyperbolas .",
    "the simple bragg - reflection interpretation also neglects any non - centrosymmetric effects since the bragg angle is the same for @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the respective kossel cones are mirror - symmetric with respect to the relevant lattice plane .      as can be seen by comparison of fig.[fig : gap_exp ] and fig.[fig : bragg ] , not all of the geometrically possible bands are equally visible in the experimentally measured kikuchi pattern . in order to account for this",
    ", the kinematical intensity @xmath21 of a bragg reflection @xmath1 is often used empirically to describe the different relative intensities of kikuchi bands . as is well known from x - ray diffraction , @xmath21 is given by the square of the absolute value of the structure factor @xmath22 in the absence of @xmath1-dependent absorption effects : @xmath23 a corresponding scaling of the bragg reflection lines is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bragg_kin ] , which allows to roughly estimate the relative intensities of the experimentally observed kikuchi bands in fig.[fig : gap_exp ] .    assignment of a kinematic intensity @xmath21 and @xmath24 to the two related bragg reflections of a kikuchi band is likewise still neglecting non - centrosymmetric effects . in the kinematic model",
    ", there is no possibility to differentiate between @xmath21 and @xmath24 due to friedel s rule , which states that both these intensities are equal in the absence of anomalous absorption .",
    "thus , the kinematical ebsd model is sensitive to laue - symmetry only .",
    "the angle - dependent kikuchi band profile intensity can be described by a function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is measured from the relevant lattice plane .",
    "the general form of @xmath25 is determined by the distance of @xmath26 to the bragg angle . for large angles ,",
    "we observe the average background intensity , since we are away from diffraction effects which are strongest near the bragg angle . in the region near the bragg angle ,",
    "the kikuchi band intensity is modulated and can go below or above the background for different angles . to approximate the complicated experimental kikuchi band profile ,",
    "a constant intensity @xmath27 can be empirically assigned to the full geometrical band width , resulting in bands with step profiles @xmath28 : @xmath29 this formula introduces an additional experimental observation , namely that the kikuchi bands in ebsd usually ( but not always ) show a higher intensity than the background . from within the kinematical model itself , however ,",
    "the actual intensity distribution @xmath25 of a kikuchi band can not be predicted at all .",
    "this also includes the constant @xmath27 for the band intensity .",
    "the obvious choice seems to be the kinematical intensity @xmath21 . in order to check the visual agreement of this assumption with the experiment , in fig.[fig : box ]",
    "we have displayed the kikuchi bands @xmath30 with grey values in one case proportional to the kinematical intensity @xmath31 , and in the other case proportional to the structure factor amplitude @xmath32 .",
    "we found correlation coefficients of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for both these types of simulations showing that the linear dependence is the better approach and that assignment of @xmath21 is not optimal .",
    "( the correlation coefficients have been calculated for a roi covering the right side of the patterns , thereby excluding the high intensity zone axes on the left side which otherwise would distort the comparison . )",
    "we would like to stress that the kinematical ebsd models are limited in several important aspects :    1 .",
    "the kinematical intensity @xmath21 actually describes the intensity of an incident plane wave beam which comes from infinity , is coherently bragg reflected by single scattering processes at the crystal atoms and goes again to infinity to be detected in a typical spot - like diffraction pattern .",
    "this is a very different experimental situation than the case of an internal point source inside the crystal which emits an electron wave that is multiply scattered and then detected at infinity outside the crystal .",
    "extensions of results from one situation to the other are not necessarily valid",
    "the kinematical model can not provide an actual formula for the kikuchi band profile .",
    "instead , the kinematical intensity @xmath21 is assigned purely empirically .",
    "while this simple model might usefully approximate a typical standard situation in ebsd and gives a rough impression about the intensity distribution within an kikuchi pattern , it totally fails to describe effects like kikuchi band contrast inversion where one actually observes dark kikuchi bands @xcite .",
    "3 .   the pairs of bragg reflections @xmath1 and @xmath35 , which are relevant for a kikuchi band , independently contribute to the final pattern in a simple sum of all `` step band '' intensities @xmath30 .",
    "this results in unrealistic intensity maxima especially along low - indexed zone axes where many bands are crossing each other .",
    "4 .   the kinematical intensity scales with the square of the structure amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "when compared to experimental kikuchi patterns , however , a linear dependence on the structure factor amplitude actually seems to provide a better fit , as we have seen above .",
    "the fact that the kinematical intensity @xmath21 does not give the best agreement of the simulations using @xmath30-profiles exposes the severe limitation of the kinematical theory in the description of the kikuchi band profile . depending on",
    "the choice of @xmath27 , the modified intensity decay from the stronger to the weaker reflections causes a different relative importance of specific simulated pattern features .",
    "this could influence the results when the @xmath30-model is applied in correlation - based strain determination , where various dependencies on @xmath37 can be selectively chosen @xcite . in view of the general deficiencies of the kinematical model",
    ", we have not looked for other functional dependencies that might provide an even better empirical fit to the experiment .",
    "while the kinematical ebsd model neglects most of the physics which is involved in the detailed kikuchi band formation , the dynamical theory of electron diffraction can provide a detailed description of experimentally measured kikuchi patterns . a simplified dynamical theory of the kikuchi pattern profile",
    "is given in @xcite , where an analytical band shape is derived based on the two - beam approximation .",
    "assuming only single - element backscatterers placed on bravais lattice positions , this band shape expresses the variation of the backscattered electron intensity near a bragg reflection with reciprocal lattice vector @xmath38 qualitatively as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a normalized deviation parameter with @xmath41 at the bragg condition , and @xmath42 contains absorption parameters for the reflection @xmath38 . in the dynamical model ,",
    "absorption parameters turn out be important for the actual shape of the kikuchi band profile and they can even contribute to an inverted band shape .",
    "this illustrates another deficiency of the kinematical model , which does not consider these absorption effects at all . for more details on the simplified two - beam profile ,",
    "we refer the reader to chapter 9 in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tba ] , the kikuchi pattern of gap is simulated using a sum of analytical two - beam profiles @xmath43 according to equation [ eq : reimereta ] .",
    "while the computational effort of this approach is still rather low , the resulting kikuchi pattern already shows a much better agreement with the experiment than any of the kinematical approximations discussed above . a main deficiency of this approach is again seen in the zone axes , where the fine structure is not reproduced faithfully due to the simple sum of band intensities with no interference .",
    "also , in the theoretical derivation of this model , the actual distribution of the different chemical elements in the unit cell is not taken into account exactly . in view of the limits of the kinematical models discussed above , the analytical two - beam profile is a better standard choice for simplified pattern simulations in the absence of the full many - beam dynamical calculations which are discussed next .",
    "realistic intensity simulations of ebsd patterns have been introduced using the bloch wave approach of the dynamical theory of electron diffraction @xcite .",
    "this approach calculates the probability that an electron will leave the crystal in a specific direction after having been incoherently scattered from the incident beam at an atomic position inside the crystal and then having undergone multiple coherent scattering in the crystal in the presence of absorption effects .    in order to compare the typical quality of dynamical ebsd simulations using the many - beam approach , in fig.[fig : gap081 ]",
    "the resulting best fit intensity distribution is displayed in comparison to the experimental pattern in fig.[fig : gapexpdyn ] .",
    "as can be seen , the numerous specific features around zone axes and within bands are well reproduced by the many - beam simulation .    in the middle of the pattern ,",
    "becomes visible as a vertical band .",
    "the intensity of this band is asymmetrically shifted to the right , as can be even seen by eye on close inspection .",
    "this specific asymmetry is an effect of the crystal polarity in the non - centrosymmetric zinc - blende type structure of gap , which can also be seen quantitatively in the cross - correlation coefficients : the best - fit simulation gives a normalized @xmath44 .",
    "the laue - group equivalent orientation in fig.[fig : gap078 ] has an additional 90 rotation around the @xmath45-axis and gives a worse value of @xmath46 , with the difference of @xmath47 being statistically significant .    .",
    "in the gap point group @xmath48 , @xmath49 can assume values from 0 to 180 , whereas the corresponding laue group @xmath50 limits @xmath49 to the range 0 .. 90,width=377 ]    the different values of @xmath6 with respect to the two laue - group equivalent orientations clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of the dynamical simulations to the actual point group of the crystal in which these two orientations are not equivalent .",
    "such a point - group sensitive orientation analysis is beyond the limits of the conventional procedure that is applied up to now in ebsd systems . as a unique new application of dynamical diffraction simulations , in fig.[fig : mapping ]",
    "we show results of absolute orientation mapping for polycrystalline gap @xcite .",
    "the conventional laue - group - specific analysis of ebsd kikuchi patterns has to leave the absolute orientation of the gap crystal undetermined by 90@xmath51 around .",
    "this indeterminacy is resolved by the point - group sensitive pattern matching approach .    summarizing this section ,",
    "the kinematic ebsd interpretation is limited to a description of the kossel - cone geometry of bragg angles and to a rough estimation of the ordering of reflections according to their kinematical intensity .",
    "still , this is useful for the selection of the strongest reflectors @xmath1 for indexing of ebsd patterns .",
    "the kinematical models for ebsd are completely insensitive to the absence of an inversion center in the crystal structure .",
    "to realistically describe ebsd kikuchi patterns , one needs to use models which apply the dynamical theory of electron diffraction .",
    "the lack of an inversion center in the crystal structure is manifested in non - symmetric kikuchi band profiles for polar lattice planes .",
    "the dynamical diffraction simulations presented above are based on certain assumptions about the physical pattern formation mechanisms . in this section ,",
    "some of these fundamental effects are presented .",
    "o@xmath52 for two different exit directions @xcite .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the energy transfer that would be expected from a classical elastic `` billiard ball '' collision between a single electron of 40kev and the respective atom.,width=415 ]    the electrons which are observed on the ebsd screen have undergone a substantial change in their direction of movement .",
    "this implies a corresponding transfer of momentum @xmath53 .",
    "coherent elastic scattering from the crystal describes the situation when the electron does not excite any internal degrees of freedom of the crystal and a macroscopic mass @xmath54 of the crystal takes up the momentum .",
    "this results in an infinitesimal value of the recoil energy @xmath55 . however , there is also the possibility that a single atomic mass @xmath56 takes up the momentum , which then results in a measurable recoil energy even for electron scattering at typical sem energies @xcite .",
    "the probability of coherent elastic scattering is strongly suppressed if the respective single - atom recoil energy @xmath57 exceeds typical phonon energies @xcite .",
    "this is the case for a typical ebsd geometry , where coherent backscattering from the crystal can thus be usually completely neglected and spot diffraction patterns of the incident beam are absent .",
    "exceptions can be observed by rheed ( reflection high energy electron diffraction ) patterns in ebsd at glancing angles or in transmission kikuchi diffraction ( tkd ) near the incident beam direction , when spot patterns can be observed that result from coherent elastic scattering . due to the dependence of the recoil energy on the atomic mass",
    ", electron spectroscopy can be applied to differentiate between different scattering atoms .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : recoil ] , where au atoms on a sapphire ( @xmath58 ) surface have been measured for two exit angles @xcite .",
    "the three peaks corresponding to au , al , and o can be clearly distinguished at their expected positions .",
    "the two different curves in fig.[fig : recoil ] show the influence of diffraction effects due to different measurement geometries . in order to prove that kikuchi patterns result from these incoherent",
    "recoil scattering events , we measured element - resolved kikuchi band profiles and compared them with dynamical simulations @xcite . in principle , the recoil loss in the electron - atom collision makes it possible to measure separate kikuchi patterns for different chemical elements in a compound phase .",
    "while the incoherent atomic recoil is the smallest possible energy loss for backscattered electrons , inelastic scattering effects contribute to the formation of kikuchi patterns in a range of energy losses of up to several hundred ev @xcite .",
    "this is why a correct description of the energy spectrum of the backscattered electrons is a key ingredient in a more complete model of kikuchi pattern formation .",
    "monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations provide a useful tool for the description of electron scattering in materials @xcite , neglecting , however , the influence of diffraction effects .",
    "inelastic scattering is often taken into account by assigning the loss energy based on the path length travelled in the crystal .",
    "this `` continuous slowing down approximation '' ( csda ) neglects the quantized character of inelastic loss processes , as a continuous loss energy is always assigned to every path length ( no matter how small ) and thus the possibility of having no energy loss at all is excluded also ( i.e. the coherent elastic backscattering discussed above ) .",
    "the quantized character of inelastic loss processes can be included by introducing the differential inverse inelastic mean free path ( diimfp ) into mc simulations , which takes into account the specific distribution of possible energy losses for an electron in a material @xcite .    in fig.[fig :",
    "bsespectrum ] , we calculated the spectrum of electrons backscattered from a si sample with a primary energy of 10kev at an incidence angle of 70 @xcite .",
    "the integrated spectral intensity is normalized to 1.0 for the range of 50ev to 10kev . in the figure",
    ", we show the result of the csda approximation as implemented in the casino @xcite code compared to a simulation which uses the diimfp @xcite .",
    "we can see that the diimfp approach reproduces the correct experimental spectrum with an elastic peak and with quantized plasmon losses ( 17ev for si ) @xcite .",
    "these spectral details are important to exactly model the energy - dependent diffraction effects which are concentrated in the spectral region rather near to the elastic peak .",
    "this means that the csda has strong limitations with respect to the combined problem of electron transport and diffraction , as it neglects the elastic peak , the plasmon features and other energy loss signatures in the backscattered electron energy spectrum and their specific localization in the crystal structure .",
    "the diimfp approach can also be used for the simulation of the angular dependence of the backscattered electrons and the intensity distribution on the phosphor screen , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bse ] . for the conversion of electrons into photons",
    ", the energy - dependent response function of the phosphor has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "a wealth of information is contained in such angle- and energy - resolved mc simulations , for instance concerning the correlation between scattering angle and the energy - distribution of the backscattered electrons @xcite which influences the energy - dependent diffraction pattern structure .",
    "this type of mc simulation is also relevant to the use of the ebsd screen as an angle - resolved detector of backscattered electrons independently of the actual diffraction effects @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations are based on the particle picture of electron scattering and thus do not contain diffraction information in a direct way .",
    "one of the remaining challenges is to consistently combine the mc model results with the diffraction simulations @xcite .",
    "this concerns , for example , the depth sensitivity of ebsd . based on observations of the width of measured diffraction lines ,",
    "the energy spread and correspondingly the related depth sensitivity of electrons contributing to an ebsd pattern has been estimated to be in the range between 10 nm and 40 nm at 20kv , with the lower values reached for dense materials @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of the disappearance of kikuchi pattern diffraction contrast when depositing amorphous layers on crystalline samples are consistent with this estimation @xcite .",
    "a successful model also needs to explain the available experimental data on the energy dependence of kikuchi band contrast in different scattering geometries @xcite .",
    "an example for the complex energy dependence of kikuchi band contrast from a si sample is shown in fig.[fig : kbcontrast ] , where the data has been measured using a high - resolution electron energy spectrometer @xcite .",
    "this data shows that depending on the incidence angle , kikuchi patterns can be formed at energy losses up to several hundred ev . due to the concentration of the backscattered intensity near the elastic peak",
    ", effectively only a rather narrow energy spectrum contributes to experimental ebsd patterns .",
    "this justifies the approximation of simulating the dynamical diffraction effects at a fixed `` effective '' energy near the primary beam energy . for the quantitative reproduction of energy - sensitive effects in the fine structure of experimental ebsd patterns",
    ", however , an extended energy range has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "summarizing , it is clearly an important question how the spatial distribution and the energy spectrum of the backscattered electrons in the sample are influencing the ebsd patterns because the inclusion of these effects in dynamical simulations could possibly allow to extract additional information from experimental ebsd measurements . in the the general case",
    ", this will require a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of electron backscattering from crystals @xcite ."
