    "this paper deals with the geometric properties of the minimizers of a nonlocal perimeter functional .    more precisely , given  @xmath1 , and an open set  @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath3-perimeter of a set  @xmath4 in  @xmath5 was defined in  @xcite as @xmath6 where  @xmath7 and , for any disjoint sets  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 , @xmath10 this nonlocal perimeter captures the global contributions between the set  @xmath11 and its complement and it is related to some models in geometry and physics , such as the motion by nonlocal mean curvature ( see  @xcite ) and the phase transitions in presence of long - range interactions ( see  @xcite ) .    as customary in the calculus of variation literature",
    ", one says that  @xmath11 is @xmath3-minimal in  @xmath5 if  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 among all the sets  @xmath8 which coincide with  @xmath11 outside  @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , the above definition does not distinguish , in principle , between sets whose symmetric difference has vanishing lebesgue measure .",
    "as in the case of minimal surfaces , we will implicitly identify sets up to sets of zero measure .",
    "more precisely , whenever necessary , we will take a representation of the set which coincides with the `` measure theoretic interior '' of the original set , i.e. those points for which there exists a ball of positive radius around them which is included in the set , up to sets of measure zero ( we refer to appendix  [ 9udfdtfd6yh665544 ] at the end of this paper for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "several analytic and geometric properties of @xmath3-minimal sets have been recently investigated , in terms , for instance , of asymptotics  @xcite , regularity  @xcite and classification  @xcite .",
    "some examples of @xmath3-minimal sets ( or , more generally , of sets which possess vanishing nonlocal mean curvatures ) have been given in  @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper establishes that an @xmath3-minimal set is a subgraph , if so are its exterior data :    [ graph ] let  @xmath14 be an open and bounded subset of  @xmath15 with boundary of class  @xmath16 , and let  @xmath17 .",
    "let  @xmath11 be an @xmath3-minimal set in  @xmath5 .",
    "assume that @xmath18 for some continuous function  @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath20 for some  @xmath21 , where  @xmath22 is a uniformly continuous function in  @xmath23 , with  @xmath24 outside  @xmath14 .",
    "we mention that , in general , @xmath3-minimal surfaces are not continuous up to the boundary of the domain ( even if the datum outside is smooth ) , and indeed boundary stickiness phenomena occur ( see  @xcite for concrete examples ) .",
    "the possible discontinuity at the boundary makes the proof of theorem  [ graph ] quite delicate , since the graph property `` almost fails '' in a cylinder ( see theorem  1.2 in  @xcite ) , and , in general , the graph property can not be deduced only from the outside data but it may also depend on the regularity of the domain .    more precisely , we stress that , given the examples in @xcite , even in simple cases , boundary stickiness of nonlocal minimal surfaces has to be expected , therefore the dirichlet problem for nonlocal minimal surfaces can not be solved in the class of functions that are continuous up to the boundary ( even for smooth dirichlet data ) .",
    "nevertheless , theorem  [ graph ] says that one can solve the dirichlet problem in the class of ( not necessarily continuous ) graphs .    due to the boundary stickiness ( i.e. , due to the possibly discontinuous behavior of the solution of the dirichlet problem ) ,",
    "the proof of theorem  [ graph ] can not be just a simple generalization of the proof of similar results for classical minimal surfaces . as a matter of fact , in principle ,",
    "once the surface reaches a vertical tangent , it might be possible that it bends in the `` wrong '' direction , which would make the graph property false ( our result in theorem  [ graph ] excludes exactly this possibility ) .",
    "the key point for this is that , due to the study of the obstacle problem for nonlocal minimal surfaces treated in @xcite , we more or less understand how the minimal surfaces separate from the boundary of the cylinder if a vertical piece is present .",
    "in addition , since we are not assuming any smoothness of the surface to start with , some care is needed to compute the fractional mean curvature in a pointwise sense .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ graph ] is based on a sliding method , but some ( both technical and conceptual ) modifications are needed to make the classical argument work , due to the contributions `` coming from far '' . we stress that , since the @xmath3-minimal set is not assumed to be smooth , some supconvolutions techniques are needed to take care of interior contact points .",
    "moreover , a fine analysis of the possible contact points which lie on the boundary ( and at infinity ) is needed to complete the arguments .    as a matter of fact",
    ", we think that it is an interesting open problem to determine whether or not theorem  [ graph ] holds true without the assumption that  @xmath25 is of class  @xmath16 ( for instance , whether or not a similar statement holds by assuming only that  @xmath25 is lipschitz ) .",
    "we remark that , under weak regularity assumptions , one can not make use of the results in @xcite .",
    "the results in theorem  [ graph ] may be strengthen in the case of dimension  @xmath0 , by proving that two - dimensional minimal graphs are smooth .",
    "indeed , we have :    [ coro : reg ] let  @xmath14 be an open and bounded subset of  @xmath26 with boundary of class  @xmath16 , and let  @xmath17 .",
    "let  @xmath11 be an @xmath3-minimal set in  @xmath5 .",
    "assume that @xmath27 for some continuous function  @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath28 for some  @xmath29 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ coro : reg ] relies on theorem  [ graph ] and on a bernstein - type result of  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : subco ]",
    "we discuss the notion of supconvolutions and subconvolutions for a nonlocal minimal surface , presenting the geometric and analytic properties that we need for the proof of theorem  [ graph ] .    in section [ kj56dffse ]",
    "we collect a series of auxiliary results needed to compute suitable integral contributions and obtain an appropriate fractional mean curvature equation in a pointwise sense ( i.e. , not only in the sense of viscosity , as done in the previous literature ) .    the proof of theorem  [ graph ] is given in section  [ hy:08 ] and the proof of theorem [ coro : reg ] is given in section  [ ljrtyuoo ] .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ 9udfdtfd6yh665544 ] , we observe that we can modify the @xmath3-minimal set  @xmath11 by a set of measure zero in order to identify  @xmath11 with the set of its interior points in the measure theoretic sense .",
    "in this section , we introduce the notion of supconvolution and discuss its basic properties .",
