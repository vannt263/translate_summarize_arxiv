    "<S> we studied the electronic structure of high quality cr(110 ) films grown on w(110 ) surface employing photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on the differently aged samples revealed distinct signatures of the surface and bulk features in the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the adsorbed oxygens form covalent bonds with the surface cr atoms at higher temperatures , while they remain almost unreacted at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the spin density wave transition induced band folding across the bulk nel temperature , we discover a weakly dispersing sharp feature emerging near the fermi level at low temperatures presumably due to correlation induced effects .    </S>",
    "<S> unusual magnetism of elemental cr led to its wide ranging applications involving recording media , high density storage media , magnetic sensors , giant magnetoresistance based devices etc . </S>",
    "<S> enormous effort has been put forward to understand the exotic electronic properties of this system , which is crucial to have further developments in technological application of this material as well as involved fundamental science . </S>",
    "<S> bulk cr forms in bcc structure and is a good example of fermi surface nesting driven antiferromagnet @xcite exhibiting incommensurate spin density wave ( isdw ) transition at 311 k that becomes commensurate via a spin - flip transition around 150 k. various studies revealed several controversies in its electronic properties ; for example , antiferromagnetic / ferromagnetic surface on antiferromagnetic bulk @xcite , complex surface - bulk differences in the electronic structure @xcite , orbital kondo effect vs. shockley surface states @xcite , proximity to quantum criticality @xcite etc . contrasting scenario on the energy gap has also been reported such as signature of pseudogap @xcite , direct multiple gaps @xcite in the isdw phase . </S>",
    "<S> manifestation of such multifaceted exoticity in a simple elemental system is remarkable and has continued to attract much attention in the fundamental science and technology for long .    </S>",
    "<S> device fabrication based on such materials requires knowledge of the surface behavior - whether the bulk properties survives at the surface , if differs how much is the deviation , etc . in order to investigate the surface electronic structure critically , we studied the evolution of the electronic structure of cr with temperature and aging . </S>",
    "<S> we prepared cr(110 ) surface , which is antiferromagnetic and expected not to favor orbital kondo resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to investigate the surface - bulk differences in the electronic structure solely due to surface termination induced effect without major change in their magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal surface and bulk character of various photoemission spectral features unambiguously and interesting evolution of the surface states on aging . </S>",
    "<S> electron correlation is found to play important role in the electronic properties of this system .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample was prepared in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber ( base pressure better than 1@xmath010@xmath1 torr ) by electron beam evaporation of cr onto a clean w(110 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the sample preparation and characterization is given in the supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> angle resolved photoemission spectroscopic ( arpes ) measurements were carried out using a phoibos150 analyzer from specs gmbh and monochromatic he </S>",
    "<S> i source ( @xmath2 = 21.2 ev ) with the momentum resolution fixed at 0.01@xmath02@xmath3 , where the lattice constant of cr , @xmath4 is 2.88   . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5-ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) measurements were carried out with a monochromatic al @xmath6 source . </S>",
    "<S> all these experiments were carried at a base pressure of about 1@xmath010@xmath1 torr . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment temperature was achieved using an open cycle helium cryostat , lt-3 m from advanced research systems , usa .        first we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure with aging . </S>",
    "<S> angle integrated photoemission technique was employed with an acceptance angle of @xmath715@xmath8 to enable quick collection of the data with good signal to noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra collected at 350 k & 30 k from freshly prepared sample are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) after normalizing by the intensity around 6 ev binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> each spectrum exhibits several features at the binding energies 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.7 , 1.5 , 2.4 & 3.2 ev - the features are denoted by a , b , c , d , e & f in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity between 0.3 - 1.2 ev binding energy range in the 350 k spectra decreases dramatically with time and becomes almost saturated within about 6 hours . </S>",
    "<S> such spectral change with aging can be attributed to the suppression of intensities by the impurities adsorbed on the surface and/or bonded to the surface atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities near the fermi level , @xmath9 appear to remain uninfluenced by aging at 350 k. curiously , a substantial decrease in intensity of a is observed at 30 k. since aging influences the surface states most prominently , the feature a must be possessing significant surface character at 30 k. such phenomena suggest a surface spectral weight transfer from higher binding energy regime to the vicinity of @xmath9 with the decrease in temperature and hence , the emergence of the surface character of the intensities around 0.2 ev at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequent to the decrease of b and c in the 350 k spectra , the intensities of the features , e and f increase with aging . employing xps ( shown in the supplementary data ) we observed that the intensity of the oxygen 1@xmath10 signal grows with time delay as often observed by us in various other studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spectral evolution observed here are attributed to the influence of oxygens on the surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the feature , e appears due to the non - bonding oxygen levels , and the features d & f correspond to the energy bands hybridized to oxygen 2@xmath11 states . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario at 30 k is significantly different ; in addition to large decrease in intensity in the vicinity of @xmath9 , intensity of the feature e becomes significantly intense within a very short time delay keeping the features d and f intensities almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the cr - o bonding is less significant at low temperatures and the presence of large amount of adsorbed oxygen that leads to an enhancement of the non - bonding feature , e.    the temperature evolution of the electronic structure across the bulk nel temperature of 311 k is investigated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 350 k and 5 k spectra obtained from the freshly prepared sample are compared in the upper panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> distinct decrease in intensity in the vicinity of @xmath9 is observed in addition to a small increase in intensity of the feature d. the surface features remain unchanged in this large temperature range due to the fact that the surface magnetic transition occurs at a higher temperature and the changes within the magnetically ordered phase is negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is further verified by cooling down the 14 hours aged sample possessing primarily the bulk features near @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the 350 k and 5 k spectra exhibit significant decrease in intensity near @xmath9 as a signature of antiferromagnetic transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the intensity around 0.7 ev ( feature c ) becomes stronger along with a decrease in intensity beyond 1.5 ev binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> this corroborates the conclusions of less cr - o bonded objects at 5 k due to less reactivity of oxygens at lower temperatures .        in order to investigate the band character of the above features , the energy band dispersions of cr(110)/w(110 ) sample obtained by arpes </S>",
    "<S> are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) . distinct signature of three energy bands denoted by @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are observed . </S>",
    "<S> these three energy bands possess behavior quite similar to the @xmath15 bands obtained from band structure calculations @xcite ; the degeneracy of the @xmath15 bands at @xmath16 is lifted due to the fact that he i photon energy ( @xmath2 = 21.2 ev ) corresponds to a @xmath17-value ( @xmath181.7@xmath02@xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the lattice constant along ( 110 ) direction ) away from the high symmetry point , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> such photon energy dependence of the band dispersion will be absent for the surface bands , which is the primary focus of this study . </S>",
    "<S> there could be additional effect due to the strain arising from the differences in the lattice constants of cr films with the w(110 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dispersion of the @xmath12 band with @xmath21 ( @xmath22-axis along the surface normal ) symmetry makes an electron pocket around the @xmath16-point and resembles well to the theoretically calculated results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the bulk bands , distinct signature of a weakly dispersive band is observed around 0.7 ev binding energy denoted by s2 in the figure , which is within the energy gap of the bulk bands @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> another almost non - dispersive feature denoted by s1 also appears near @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> these features are found to be significantly sensitive to aging as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( features , a and c ) indicating their surface character . the comparison of the experimental spectra at 296 k and 350 k in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) reveals interesting evolution . </S>",
    "<S> while all the energy bands remain almost similar , the @xmath12 band appears to fold back at @xmath23 as shown in the figure - signature of band folding due to incommensurate sdw transition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a new feature denoted by @xmath24 appears near @xmath25 .     and </S>",
    "<S> ( g ) @xmath26 . ]    the temperature evolution of the features near @xmath9 as a function of temperature is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the band folding effect , the comparison of the spectra at 350 k , 296 k and 10 k exhibit emergence of a sharp feature around 15 mev below @xmath9 possessing weak dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the distinct nature of this additional intensity is most evident in the energy distribution curves shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) and 3(g ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it exhibits different trend in the change in intensities with temperature at @xmath16 and @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) - the intensity at @xmath9 gradually increases with the decrease in temperature at @xmath16 while the intensity at 296 k is the lowest at @xmath23 .     and ( b ) @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) and ( d ) show the spectral density of states near @xmath9 at different temperatures in an expanded energy scale . ]    </S>",
    "<S> detailed temperature evolution of the features in the low temperature range ( below 110 k ) are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , where we show the energy distribution curves at @xmath25 and @xmath29 = 1.0 . the features around 1.5 ev binding energy represent the intensities of the @xmath13 & @xmath14 bands corresponding to the bulk electronic structure and exhibit enhancement in intensity with the decrease in temperature at @xmath29 = 1.0 , while it seems opposite at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the intensity increases at 1.5 ev as observed in the angle integrated spectra shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) suggesting an enhancement of the local moment of the system within the magnetically ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities at @xmath9 exhibit significant enhancement at low temperatures and asymmetry with respect to @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) and 4(d ) after dividing the experimental spectra by the resolution broadened fermi - distribution function .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the electronic structure of one of the most used elemental metal , cr is quite complex . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our extensive experimental study unveil plethora of interesting scenarios , which have significant impact on application of this materials for future technological advancements . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we identify the surface features via reduction in intensity due to aging and observe that the degradation of the surface features of cr film strongly depends on temperature . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> we observe signature of adsorbed oxygen , which reduces the surface feature intensities . at elevated temperatures , the oxygens form bonding with the surface cr atoms that enhances cr spectral contributions at higher binding energies ( around 3.2 ev ) due to the bonding - antibonding splitting of the electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the reactivity to surface impurities at higher temperature happens due to the thermal energy providing suitable activation for such reactions .    while the above results on aging of the cr surface provide details of the surface stability , the spectral evolution due to adsorption / bonding of impurities with the surface atoms helps to identify the surface and bulk features in the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> there have been controversy on the surface character of the spectral feature at 0.7 ev binding energy denoted by s2 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> substantial decrease in intensity with aging unambiguously indicates surface character of s2 . </S>",
    "<S> the other important issue involves the observation of significant sensitivity of s1 to aging at 30 k and it s absence at 350 k. this suggests that the predominant surface character around 0.2 ev becomes evident at low temperatures presumably due to the fact that the bulk contributions near @xmath9 diminishes significantly at low temperatures due to the formation of sdw gap making the relative surface contributions near @xmath9 discernible at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there could be surface spectral weight transfer with the decrease in temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> photoemission measurements at room temperature with varied angle of incident / emitted photon beam concluded shockley type surface states with @xmath30 character of s1@xcite . in order to learn the orbital character of the growing intensities at low temperatures , we compare the spectra obtained at two geometries - the incident photon beam at 61@xmath8 ( @xmath29=0.0 ) and </S>",
    "<S> 40@xmath8 ( @xmath29=1.0 ) with respect to the surface normal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath29 = 1.0 case becomes slightly more favorable to probe @xmath31 states and the @xmath30 states becomes significantly less sensitive due to relatively more in - plane alignment of the light polarization vector . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) , we observe that the intensity of the sharp feature at 15 mev becomes more intense in the @xmath29=1.0 spectra suggesting @xmath31 character of the growing feature over the intensities of s1 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is to note here that the studied cr(110 ) surface is unlikely to exhibit orbital kondo behavior as the surface is expected to be antiferromagnetic , while orbital kondo effect corresponds to spin - ferromagnetic order @xcite . in general , correlated electron systems such as rare - earths @xcite and transition metal oxides @xcite exhibit temperature reduction induced growth of the coherent feature at @xmath9 with respect to the intensities of the incoherent feature representing the correlation induced electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the sharp feature around 15 mev binding energy with the decrease in temperature observed here presumably suggests similar scenario in this system </S>",
    "<S> . clearly , more studies are necessary to understand the complexity of the electronic structure of this system .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the detailed electronic structure of high quality cr(110 ) films grown on w(110 ) employing angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the aging of the sample surface helped to reveal the surface and bulk character of various spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorbed oxygens on the surface form bonds with the surface cr atoms at temperatures close to room temperature , while they behave like adsorbed gas at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk electronic structure exhibits signature of band folding due to bulk spin density wave transition . </S>",
    "<S> there are two surface peaks around 0.2 ev and 0.7 ev binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature variation down to 5 k reveals emergence of an additional sharp feature corresponding to the surface electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> these results reveal the complex surface behavior of cr , instability of the surface states with aging and the importance of electron correlation induced effect in the electronic structure , which are important to understand for its potential applications . </S>"
