    "the recent data from type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and so on @xcite have provided strong evidences for a spatially flat and accelerated expanding universe at the present time . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , this acceleration is attributed to the domination of a component with negative pressure , called dark energy .",
    "so far , the nature of dark energy remains a mystery .",
    "theoretically , the simplest candidate for such a component is a small positive cosmological constant , but it suffers the difficulties associated with the fine tuning and the coincidence problems .",
    "so many physicists are attracted by the idea of dynamical dark energy models , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , quintom @xcite and so on ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "usually , dark energy models are constructed by scalar fields which are able to accommodate a rich variety of behaviors phenomenologically .",
    "however , there is another possibility that the acceleration of the universe is driven by a classical homogeneous spinor field .",
    "some earlier studies on applications of spinor fields in cosmology are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in recent years",
    "there are many works on studying spinor fields as gravitational sources in cosmology , for example : see refs .",

    "@xcite for spinor matter in bianchi type i spacetime ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a dark energy model with spinor matter ; and so on .",
    "although the recent fits to the data in combination of the 3-year wmap @xcite , the recently released 182 snia gold sample @xcite and also other cosmological observational data show remarkably the consistence of the cosmological constant , it is worth noting that a class of dynamical models with the equation - of - state ( eos ) across @xmath2 _ quintom _ is mildly favored @xcite . in the literature there have been a lot of theoretical studies of quintom - like models .",
    "for example , motivated from string theory , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite realized a quintom scenario by considering the non - perturbative effects of a generalized dbi action .",
    "moreover , a no - go theorem has been proven to constrain the model building of quintom @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some earlier considerations ) , and according to this no - go theorem there are models which involve higher derivative terms for a single scalar field @xcite , models with vector field @xcite , making use of an extended theory of gravity @xcite , non - local string field theory @xcite , and others ( see e.g. @xcite ) . the similar work applied in scalar - tensor theory has also been studied in ref .",

    "usually , a quintom model involves a ghost field with its kinetic term to be negative which leads to quantum instability . in this paper",
    "we study the dark energy model with spinor matter .",
    "interestingly , we find that this type of model can realize the quintom scenario with its eos across the cosmological constant boundary @xmath3 without introducing a ghost field . instead , the derivative of its potential with respect to the scalar bilinear @xmath4 , which is defined as the mass term , becomes negative when the spinor field lies in the phantom - like phase .",
    "if this model can realize its eos across @xmath2 more than one time , the total eos of the universe can satisfy @xmath5 during the whole evolution which is required by the null energy condition ( nec ) @xcite , and we expect to treat this process as a phase transition merely existing for a short while .",
    "moreover , due to a perfect mathematic property of the spinor field , it is possible to combine the quintom scenario and the picture of chaplygin gas with the eos evolving from @xmath6 to @xmath2 smoothly in spinor quintom . in the literature a dark energy model of chaplygin gas",
    "has been proposed to describe a transition from a universe filled with dust - like matter to an accelerated expanding stage , and hence it has been argued that the coincidence problem of dark energy may be alleviated in this model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in our model we are able to evade the drawbacks of considering the phantom field , of which the kinetic energy is negative and so is unstable in quantum level .",
    "we notice that ref .",
    "@xcite has investigated the quantum stability of a phantom phase of cosmic acceleration and shown that a super - acceleration phase can be obtained by quantum effects .",
    "our model is different from that one since the super - acceleration is realized by the background contribution .",
    "however , it is interesting that both the two approaches are stable in quantum level since the first order of perturbation theory can be defined .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we simply review the basic algebra of a spinor field in frw universe which is minimally coupled to einstein s gravity . in section iii , we present the condition for the spinor field to realize a quintom scenario and give some detailed examples . in section iv",

    "a connection between the metric @xmath7 and the vierbein is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the vierbein , @xmath7 is the space - time metric , and @xmath10 is the minkowski metric with @xmath11 . note that the latin indices represents the local inertial frame and the greek indices represents the space - time frame .",
    "we choose the dirac - pauli representation as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is pauli matrices .",

    "the @xmath14 matrix @xmath23 is the spin connection , where @xmath24 are ricci spin coefficients .    by the aid of the above algebra we can write down the following dirac action in a curved space - time background@xcite @xmath25~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath26 is the determinant of the vierbein @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for the potential of the spinor field @xmath0 and its adjoint @xmath21 . due to the requirement of covariance ,",
    "the potential @xmath28 only depends on the scalar bilinear @xmath4 and  pseudo - scalar \" term @xmath29 .",
    "for simplicity we drop the latter term and assume that there is @xmath30 .",

    "in this paper we deal with the homogeneous and isotropic frw metric , @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the scale factor and we choose today s scale factor @xmath37 .",
    "correspondingly , the vierbein are given by @xmath38 assuming the spinor field is space - independent , the equation of motion reads @xmath39 where a dot denotes a time derivative ` @xmath40 ' and a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath4 , and @xmath41 is the hubble parameter . taking a further derivative , we can obtain : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a positive time - independent constant and we define it as today s value of @xmath4 .    from the expression of the energy - momentum tensor in eq .",
    "( [ emt ] ) , we get the energy density and the pressure of the spinor field : @xmath44 where eqs .",
    "( [ eoma ] ) and ( [ eomb ] ) have been applied .",
    "the eos of the spinor field , defined as the ratio of its pressure to energy density , is given by @xmath45    simply taking the potential to be power - law - like @xmath46 with @xmath47 as a nonzero constant , we obtain a constant eos : @xmath48 in this case , the spinor matter behaves like a linear - barotropic - like perfect fluid .",
    "for example : if @xmath49 , we can get @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which is the same as radiation ; if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 , this component behaves like normal matter .",
    "furthermore , the spinor matter is able to realize the acceleration of the universe if @xmath55 .",
    "so it provides us a potential motivation to construct a dynamical dark energy model with the spinor matter .",
    "moreover , as introduced at the beginning of section i , there is evidence in the recent observations to mildly support a quintom scenario with the eos of dark energy across @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "we emphasize our investigation on constructing quintom dark energy model with the spinor field , which is called spinor quintom .      to keep the energy density positive",

    "( [ eos ] ) .",
    "the former corresponds to a quintessence - like phase and the latter stands for a phantom - like phase .",

    "when the value of @xmath4 equals to b , it crosses @xmath2 for the first time .",
    "after the first crossing , it enters the phantom - like state and continuously descends until passes through its minimum , then ascends to @xmath85 and then experiences the second crossing , and eventually moving up to the quintenssence - like phase .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quinc ] .",
    "one can see that the big rip can be avoided in this case .",
    "moreover , taking the component of normal matter with the energy density @xmath86 into consideration and the eos @xmath87 , we can see that the eos of the universe @xmath88 satisfies the relation @xmath89 in this case . as is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , nec might be satisfied in the models though @xmath63 only stays for a short period during the evolution of the universe .    $ ] , where we choose @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the model parameters . for the initial condition",
    "we take @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : quinc ] ]    one important issue of a dark energy model is the analysis of its perturbations . to study this issue",
    ", we might be able to learn to what degree the system is stable both in quantum and classical level . usually systems with @xmath90 show some nasty instabilities , for example , a phantom universe suffers a big rip singularity .",
    "although this singularity can be avoided in most quintom models which usually enter a de - sitter expansion in the final epoch , all the scalar models of quintom by now suffer a quantum instability since there are negative kinetic modes from ghost fields . here",
    "we would like to show the perturbation theory of spinor quintom crudely .",
    "since we do not introduce any ghost fields in our model , the crossing of phantom divide is achieved by the spinor field itself and does not perform any particular instabilities .    in order to simplify the derivative",
    ", we would like to redefine the spinor as @xmath91 . then perturbing the spinor field , one gives the perturbation equation as follows , @xmath92\\delta\\psi_n\\nonumber\\\\ = -2a^2v'v''\\delta(\\bar\\psi\\psi)\\psi_n - i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu[a v''\\delta(\\bar\\psi\\psi)]\\psi_n~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the conformal time defined by @xmath94 .",
    "since the right hand side of the equation decays proportional to @xmath95 or even faster , we can neglect those terms during the late time evolution of the universe for simplicity .    from the perturbation equation above",
    ", we can read that the sound speed is equal to @xmath73 which eliminates the instability of the system in short wavelength .",
    "moreover , when the eos @xmath96 crosses @xmath2 , we have @xmath70 at that moment and the eigen function of the solution to eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) in momentum space is a hankel function with an index @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the perturbations of the spinor field oscillate inside the hubble radius .",
    "this is an interesting result , because in this way we might be able to establish the quantum theory of the spinor perturbations , just as what is done in inflation theory .",
    "note that , the above derivative does not mean that spinor quintom is able to avoid any instabilities .",
    "we still do not study the effects of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) which may destroy the system under some certain occasions .",
    "another possible instability may be from the quantum effect that our model is unable to be renormalized .",
    "the more detailed calculation will be investigated in the future works .",
    "in the above analysis , we have learned that a spinor field with a power - law - like potential behaves like a perfect fluid with a constant eos .",
    "however , it is still obscure to establish a concrete model to explain how a universe dominated by matter evolves to the current stage that is dominated by dark energy . in recent years , another interesting perfect fluid with an exotic eos",
    "@xmath1 has been applied into cosmology @xcite in the aim of unifying a matter dominated phase where @xmath98 and a de - sitter phase where @xmath99 which describes the transition from a universe filled with dust - like matter to an exponentially expanding universe .",
    "this so - called chaplygin gas @xcite and its generalization @xcite has been intensively studied in a literature . some possibilities for this model motivated by field theory are investigated in @xcite .",

    "the chaplygin gas model has been thoroughly investigated for its impact on the cosmic expansion history .",
    "a considerable range of models was found to be consistent with sn ia data @xcite , the cmbr @xcite , the gamma - ray bursts @xcite , the x - ray gas mass fraction of clusters @xcite , the large scale structure @xcite , and so on .    here , we propose a new model constructed by spinor quintom which combines the property of a chaplygin gas .",

    "altering the form of @xmath101 , one can realize both the chaplygin gas and quintom scenario in a spinor field .",
    "firstly , let us see how this model recovers a picture of generalized chaplygin gas .",
