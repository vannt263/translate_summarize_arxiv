    "ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) are the faintest among the known galaxies in the observed universe .",
    "they are much fainter ( @xmath7 ) and smaller ( @xmath8 pc ) than classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ; see the reviews by @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "although ufds have very low stellar mass ( @xmath9 ) , they have dynamical masses comparable to those of dsphs .",
    "thus they have exceedingly large values for mass to light ratio , @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite , showing that they belong to the most dark matter dominated stellar systems in the universe .",
    "stellar populations in ufds are old and very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) photometry shows that most stars in ufds were formed in a single burst before 12 gyrs ago , which is in contrast to the star formation history of the classical dsphs that show often multiple bursts over an extended period @xcite .",
    "thus ufds are strong candidates for the fossil remnants of the first galaxies that finished forming stars before the epoch of reionization in the local universe @xcite .",
    "ufds provide strong clues for understanding two well - known dwarf problems in cosmology : missing satellite dwarf problem and satellite dwarf quenching problem @xcite .",
    "to date ufds were found only around the milky way galaxy and m31 in the local group @xcite .",
    "it is mainly due to the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that they were discovered in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "wide field surveys such as the sdss allowed to search for these kinds of objects in the local group @xcite . however , it is very difficult to find ufds beyond the local group with current facilities , because of their faintness and smallness . in this study",
    "we present the discovery of a ufd in the virgo cluster that is as distant as 16 mpc , taking advantage of high resolution in the very deep images in the hst archive .",
    "we used deep images of an isolated intracluster field close to the virgo center available in the archive ( prop .",
    "i d : 10131 ) , as marked in figure 1 .",
    "figure [ fig_finder](a ) shows the location of this field on the very deep image of the virgo core region given by @xcite .",
    "this field is located far ( about 180 kpc or more ) from massive galaxies such as m87 , m86 and m84 , where the diffuse light from massive galaxies is barely recognized .",
    "it is in the region with the lowest sky surface brightness in the core of virgo , although it is close to the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "these images were obtained with the f606w and f814w filters in the advanced camera for surveys on board the @xmath14 .",
    "these images were used in previous studies : the discovery of four intracluster globular clusters @xcite , a study of the metallicity distribution function of the intracluster stars @xcite , and the discovery of a new resolved dsph in virgo @xcite .",
    "we constructed deeper drizzled images for each filter by combining single - exposure images , as done in @xcite .",
    "the pixel scale in the drizzled images is @xmath15 pixel@xmath16 , and the fwhm of point sources is @xmath17 pixels .",
    "total exposure times are 63440 s and 26880 s for the f606w and f814w images , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig_finder](b ) displays the color image constructed from the drizzled f606w and f814w images .",
    "iraf / daophot @xcite was applied to the drizzled images to derive the point - spread function fitting photometry of the point sources .",
    "we then calibrated and transformed them onto johnson - cousins @xmath18 magnitudes following @xcite .",
    "section of the hst field of virgo ufd1 .",
    "the dashed - line circle indicates the tidal radius of virgo ufd1 .",
    "note that most resolved stars are red giants in the galaxy . ]",
    "the dsph galaxy discovered in the same images and studied by @xcite ( called virgo dsph - d07 hereafter ) , is easily seen as a relatively large system of resolved stars , as shown in figure 1 of @xcite and figure [ fig_finder ] in this study .",
    "its @xmath19 magnitude is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and its effective radius is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 pc ) , which is derived from the srsic profile fit , @xmath24 and @xmath25 given by @xcite @xcite .",
    "ufds are , if any , expected to be much fainter and smaller and have lower surface brightness than this galaxy in the same images . considering this , we visually searched for small groups of faint point sources embedded in the faint diffuse background with low surface brightness .    through inspection of the entire field , we found only one ufd candidate in the position as marked in figure [ fig_finder](b ) .",
    "it indeed looks much fainter and smaller than virgo dsph - d07 in the figure .",
    "we call this new galaxy , virgo ufd1 hereafter . a zoomed in image of the galaxy in figure 1(c )",
    "shows a small grouping of stars as well as faint diffuse background emission in an almost circular area with @xmath26 radius .",
    "one bright elongated object north of virgo ufd1 is considered to be a background galaxy because no stars are resolved in the galaxy .",
    "virgo ufd1 is the first ufd discovered beyond the local group .",
    "cmds of the resolved stars within the tidal radius of virgo ufd1 ( a ) and the control field at @xmath27 that are 10 times larger than the galaxy field ( b ) .",

    "curved lines denote the 12 gyr stellar isochrones for [ fe / h ] = @xmath28 to @xmath29 in steps of 0.2 provided by the dartmouth group @xcite , shifted according to @xmath30 and @xmath31 . ]        figure 2(a ) shows the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the resolved stars at @xmath32 tidal radius ( @xmath33 from the center of virgo ufd1 ) .",
    "we also plotted the cmd of the resolved stars in the control field at @xmath34 ( covering a region 10 times larger than the galaxy region to show a larger number of stars ) for comparison in figure 2(b ) .",
    "we statistically subtracted the contribution of the field stars in the galaxy cmd using the control field cmd , and displayed the resulting cmd in figure 2(c ) .",
    "we also showed the cmds of virgo dsph - d07 as a reference to study the resolved stars in virgo ufd1 .",
    "we derived the photometry of the resolved stars in this galaxy using the same procedures as were used for virgo ufd1 .",
    "figures 2(d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) display the cmd of the virgo dsph - d07 region , the cmd of the control field for this galaxy ( 10 times larger than the galaxy field ) , and the field - subtracted cmd , respectively .",
    "we also overlayed isochrones for 12 gyr age with [ fe / h]@xmath35 to 0.0 ( with a step of 0.2 ) in the dartmouth group @xcite , shifted according to the distance modulus , @xmath36 @xcite and foreground reddening @xmath31 @xcite .    figure 2(c ) shows that most of the stars in virgo ufd1 have a narrow range of color , @xmath37 , and they appear to be located along the old red giant branch ( rgb ) , similar to those of the metal - poor globular clusters in the milky way galaxy .",
    "the magnitude of the brightest star among these stars is @xmath38 .",
    "one lonely star 1.3 mag above the brightest part of the rgb is probably a field object .",
    "there are two stars much bluer than the rgb ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "both stars are blended with other objects . moreover ,",
    "one of them is located relatively far ( @xmath41 ) from the center of the galaxy .",
    "they may not belong to this galaxy . comparing the cmds for virgo ufd1 and virgo dsph - d07 shows that the rgb of virgo ufd1 is in general very similar to that of virgo dsph - d07 given that have a very low metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath42 @xcite , indicating that the metallicity of virgo ufd1 is also very metal - poor .",
    "it is also noted that there are no asymptotic giant branch stars in virgo ufd1 , while there are a small number of agb candidates above the tip of the rgb in virgo dsph - d07 .",
    "this indicates that virgo ufd1 is very old ( older than 10 gyr ) .",
    "the number of stars in the rgb of virgo ufd1 is small , so it is not easy to derive a reliable distance to this galaxy using the trgb method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43-band magnitude of the brightest star in the rgb is @xmath44 . if we take the mean of the two brightest stars we obtain @xmath45 .",
    "these stars can be considered to correspond to the trgb .",
    "we derived the trgb distances to these two dwarf galaxies and intracluster stars based on our photometry . since they are all in the same images , they are useful for estimating the relative distances between them .",
    "we adopted the mean @xmath46band magnitude of the two brightest stars as the trgb for virgo ufd1 , and measured the trgb magnitudes for virgo dsph - d07 , and intracluster stars as done in @xcite .",
    "derived values are : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for virgo ufd1 , virgo dsph - d07 , and intracluster stars , respectively .",
    "we derived the measurement error of the trgb magnitude from 1000 simulations of bootstrap resampling .",
    "the values for virgo dsph - d07 and intracluster stars are consistent with those derived from the same images in previous studies : @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the corresponding distance moduli , based on the trgb calibration in @xcite , are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for virgo ufd1 , virgo dsph - d07 , and intracluster stars , respectively .",
    "systematic errors for these estimates are estimated to be 0.12 .",
    "we also measured distance moduli to these stellar systems based on the visual isochrone fitting on the @xmath55 cmd .",
    "adopting 12 gyr isochrones provided by dartmouth group @xcite , we obtained @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for virgo ufd1 , virgo dsph - d07 , and intracluster stars , respectively .",
    "these values are , on average , @xmath590.1 mag smaller than , but consistent with , those from the trgb method . comparing the @xmath60 color of the red giants and the isochrones",
    ", we estimate the mean metallicity to be very low , @xmath61fe / h@xmath62 = -2.4\\pm0.4 $ ]",
    ". we adopt the values from visual isochrone fitting as a distance modulus to these stellar systems .",
    "visual isochrone fitting determines the distance considering the stars along the isochrone , whereas , the edge detection response function in the trgb method determined by a few stars near the trgb level might cause a larger uncertainty in the case of virgo ufd1 .",
    "these results show that the distance modulus of virgo dsph - d07 is @xmath63 ( = @xmath64 mpc ) larger than that of intracluster stars .",
    "the distance modulus of virgo ufd1 is @xmath65(=@xmath66 mpc ) smaller than that of virgo dsph - d7 , but @xmath67 ( = @xmath68 mpc ) larger than the intracluster stars .",
    "these difference are at the level of 2@xmath69 .",
    "these results show the following .",
    "first , virgo ufd1 is indeed a member of the virgo cluster .",
    "second , virgo ufd1 may be @xmath591 mpc behind the intracluster stars , but @xmath591 mpc closer than virgo dsph - d07 .",
    "we derived integrated properties of this galaxy from surface photometry .",
    "we masked out bright galaxies and bright stars that appear to be non - members of the galaxy .",
    "then we derived the surface photometry of the galaxy using the ellipse task in iraf .",
    "figure [ fig_surf ] displays the surface brightness and integrated magnitude profiles for virgo ufd1 as a function of mean radius ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we also plotted the radial density profile of detected stars , which is roughly consistent with the surface brightness profiles .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of virgo ufd1 are almost flat in the inner region and decline steeply in the outer region , which is very similar to those of virgo dsph - d07 @xcite .",
    "we fit the surface brightness profiles with the king model @xcite and the srsic law @xcite . from the @xmath2-band king model fit",
    ", we derive the core radius , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 pc ) , the tidal radius , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 pc ) , and the concentration parameter , @xmath75 . from the @xmath2-band srsic law fit , we obtain the effective radius @xmath76 ( @xmath77 pc ) , and the central surface brightness , @xmath5 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the integrated magnitude profile becomes constant at @xmath79 .",
    "we derived an apparent total magnitude of the galaxy , @xmath80 for the aperture radius @xmath81 . from this",
    ", we obtained an absolute magnitude , @xmath3 , whose error includes the errors due to photometry and distance measurement .",
    "we also estimated total magnitude of the galaxy , integrating the luminosity of the resolved red giants and unresolved stars assuming luminosity function with a power - law index @xmath82 , obtaining @xmath83 .",
    "this value is similar to the value derived from integrated photometry .",
    "thus , virgo ufd1 is much smaller and fainter than the classical dsphs in the local group and smaller and fainter than any known virgo galaxies .",
    "table 1 lists the basic parameters of virgo ufd1 derived in this study .",

    "in figure 4 we compare the structural parameters of virgo ufd1 and those for other dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe : local group dwarfs including dsphs and ufds @xcite , dwarf galaxies in nearby galaxies ( m81 group @xcite and m106 @xcite ) , low surface brightness galaxies in m101 @xcite , and virgo dsph - d07 @xcite .",
    "we also plotted the globular clusters in the milky way galaxy @xcite , ultra - compact dwarf objects ( ucds ) in nearby galaxies @xcite , and elliptical galaxies @xcite for reference .",
    "the half - light radius and absolute magnitude of virgo ufd1 follow the relation for other ufds in the local group extending out to that for dsphs , but they are separated from those for globular clusters and ucds .",
    "virgo ufd1 is larger , but fainter , than ucds .",
    "it is as bright as a globular cluster , but is significantly larger than the latter .",
    "the central surface brightness and absolute magnitude of this new galaxy are also similar to those of the local group ufds .",
    "it turns out that the properties of virgo ufd1 are similar to those of local group ufds .      according to the current lcdm model , the minimum mass of the dark matter subhalos that can form before reionization is lower than @xmath110 .",
    "the first galaxies formed from these subhalos formed most of their stars before reionization ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 gyr ago ) . if these stars survive in the local universe today , they can be observed as fossils of the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "some ufds in the local group are strong candidates for these fossils @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to derive a detailed star formation history of virgo ufd1 , because our photometry does not reach the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "however , even the current photometry provides a useful clue for tracing the early history of this galaxy .",
    "virgo ufd1 shows only metal - poor rgb stars and no agb stars , while virgo dsph - d07 shows a small number of agb star candidates above the trgb .",
    "this indicates that virgo ufd1 is very old ( older than 10 gyr )",
    ". it may be as old as the six local group ufds that show only stars older than 12 gyr @xcite .",
    "it is located close to the virgo center , far ( more than 180 kpc ) from any nearby massive galaxies . the projected distance between this new",
    "galaxy and m87 is large , but smaller than the viral radius , @xmath113 kpc @xcite .",
    "we can not tell the spatial separation between this and other massive galaxies at the moment , but it must be larger than the projected distance .",
    "@xcite derived a trgb distance to m87 from the @xmath14 photometry of an inner field , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 mpc ) .",
    "this value is similar , within errors , to that to virgo ufd1 .",
    "therefore we can not tell whether virgo ufd1 is located within the virial radius of m87 or other massive galaxies .",
    "we checked any hint of tidal interaction ( tidal shredding ) from the morphology and structure of this new galaxy in the images , finding no clear signature of tidal interaction around this galaxy .",
    "@xcite also found that there is no hint of tidal feature around virgo dsph - d07 .",
    "@xcite discussed a possibility that dsph - d07 may be behind the virgo center , at a similar distance to m86 and that dsph - d07 may be a member of the m86 group and may as if recently be infalling to the virgo center recently . considering its old age ( based on narrow rgb with no agb stars ) , low metallicity , and spatial location in the intracluster field ,",
    "virgo ufd1 may be a fossil remnant of the first galaxies .",
    "the number of dark satellite subhalos around massive galaxies like the milky way galaxy predicted from simulations based on the hierarchical formation scenario , including cold dark matter , was of the order of magnitude larger than the number of known satellite dwarf galaxies around the milky way galaxy and m31 @xcite .",
    "it is called a massing satellite dwarf problem . since the introduction of this problem",
    ", much progress has been made in both observations and theories to solve this problem , but it is still a hot issue @xcite . from the observational point of view , ufds are a strong candidate for understanding this problem .",
    "the number of known ufds in the local group is @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this number is still increasing and will continue to do so with the advent of new wide - field surveys @xcite .",
    "the discovery of one ufd in virgo indicates that ufds are not unique to the local group , but may be common throughout in the universe .",
    "there may be thousands of ufds in virgo , and hundreds of ufds around each massive galaxy .",
    "some true fossils of the first galaxies may be wandering in the intracluster field .",
    "thus , virgo may provide another laboratory in which to investigate the missing satellite problem .",
    "we need a deep survey with high spatial resolution ( like the @xmath14 ) to find more ufds in virgo .",
