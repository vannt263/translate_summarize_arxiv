    "the physics of topological insulators is one of the most important subjects in recent condensed matter physics@xmath1 . a topological phase realized in a topological insulator",
    "is characterized by a non - trivial band structure , which has a non - zero @xmath2 or @xmath3 topological invariant .",
    "although the bulk of a topological insulator is a band insulator , its boundary state is a topologically protected metal .",
    "several models of realistic topological insulators with strong spin - orbit interaction@xmath4 have been proposed theoretically , and some of them have been realized experimentally@xmath5 .",
    "topological phases have been generalized to gapped materials like superconductors and the periodic table of topological phases in any spatial dimension@xmath6 has been obtained .",
    "one of the reasons why topological insulators attract a lot of interest is their theoretical simplicity due to the one - body nature of the band theory .",
    "since the fundamental classification of non - interacting topological insulators has been completed , one of the remaining major issues is many - body effects in these materials .",
    "some works have focused on phase transitions in topological insulators in the presence of short - range interactions@xmath7 .",
    "for instance , the kane - mele model with hubbard interaction has been investigated by both analytical@xmath8 and numerical@xmath9 calculations .",
    "other works targeted topological phases driven not by spin - orbit interactions but by short - range interactions@xmath10 .",
    "however , the screening effect is generally weak in insulators , semiconductors , and semimetals due to the small density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "therefore it is a non - trivial problem whether or not we can assume a short - range interaction for a topological insulator . in particular , the surface state of a three - dimensional topological insulator like bi@xmath11se@xmath12 forms a massless dirac electron system@xmath13 like graphene .",
    "it is well known that the long - range coulomb interaction ( lrci ) plays a crucial role in a usual dirac electron system@xmath14 .",
    "we should therefore assume the lrci at least in the surface state .",
    "effects of the lrci have been well investigated in a massless dirac electron system .",
    "some works have investigated interaction effects in graphene using the wilsonian renormalization group analysis@xmath15 .",
    "these works have shown that the fermi velocity is a relevant coupling constant in the 1-loop level renormalization group analysis .",
    "this velocity enhancement would also occur in the surface state , which is a new type of massless dirac electron system .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between graphene and the surface dirac electron system .",
    "pauli matrices in the effective hamiltonian for graphene represent pseudo spin . on the other hand ,",
    "pauli matrices in the surface dirac electron system represent real spin .",
    "this would cause a different spin response to the magnetic field .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the spin response of the surface state of a three - dimensional topological insulator in the presence of the lrci using the wilsonian renormalization group analysis .",
    "we find a renormalization of the g - factor which is absent in graphene .",
    "also we show that the spin susceptibility is enhanced compared with the non - interacting case . in sect.2",
    ", we introduce a model of the surface dirac system and discuss some justification of perturbation theory . in sect.3 , we introduce the wilsonian renormalization group analysis at 1-loop level and check the fermi velocity renormalization , which occurs in a usual dirac electron system . in sect.4 , we derive the renormalization group equation for the g - factor and show the g - factor renormalization , which is a unique property of the surface state . in sect.5 , we first show that the spin susceptibility of the surface state is totally different from a usual dirac electron system even in the non - interacting case .",
    "then we calculate the spin susceptibility of the surface state in the presence of the lrci .",
    "although the fermi velocity renormalization decreases the spin susceptibility , we obtain the enhanced spin susceptibility due to the g - factor renormalization .",
    "we investigate the linearized surface dirac hamiltonian of a three - dimensional topological insulator @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi velocity and @xmath18 s represent spin pauli matrices .",
    "we set the momentum cutoff @xmath19 and assume the chemical potential @xmath0 in the following .",
    "the bare thermal green function is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the @xmath22th fermionic matsubara frequency . in this paper",
    ", we assume the two - dimensional lrci @xmath14 @xmath23 due to the non - screening nature of dirac electron systems . we treat this interaction as a perturbation .",
    "the magnitude of the interaction compared with the bare hamiltonian @xmath24 is a constant of order unity in usual dirac electron systems@xmath14 .",
    "it seems that this relatively large @xmath25 breaks the perturbative renormalization group .",
    "however , previous studies of the perturbative renormalization group in dirac electron systems @xmath26 have shown that the fermi velocity is renormalized to large values .",
    "this will justify the perturbative renormalization group analysis at low energy scale .",
    "although the connection between small @xmath25 region and large one is still unclear , we perform the perturbative renormalization group analysis in this paper as in the previous studies .",
    "in this section , we perform the 1-loop wilsonian renormalization group ( wrg ) analysis of the hamiltonian ( @xmath27 ) in the presence of the lrci . although the same fermi velocity renormalization has been obtained in previous studies@xmath26 , we show the wrg analysis which is used in the later sections .",

    "momenta are rescaled so that the action has the same momentum cutoff as the original one . in this rescaling procedure",
    ", we also have to rescale frequencies and fields to keep the form of the quadratic action . in the finite temperature wrg ,",
