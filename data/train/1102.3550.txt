    "heterostructures and superlattices ( sls ) of oxide perovskites open an exciting field of research , since it is possible by present epitaxy techniques to grow samples with clearly defined interfaces allowing for the realization of new functionalities .",
    "some examples are the two - dimensional electron gas at the srtio@xmath2-laalo@xmath2 interface,@xcite electron tunnelling in multiferroic systems,@xcite growth of extrinsic multiferroic superlattices,@xcite as well as the observation of a giant interlayer exchange coupling in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2/srruo@xmath2 superlattices.@xcite the latter exchange coupling leads to positive exchange bias@xcite and is mediated by the direct mn - o - ru - bond .",
    "@xcite the exchange bias is very large , since the individual layer thickness in the sls is very small . in general , in systems with strong correlations between the electronic , magnetic and structural degrees of freedom one would expect to find new phenomena in the limit of ultrathin layers , i.e.  in restricted geometries .    in this paper ,",
    "another type of perovskite superlattice is studied , consisting out of ultrathin pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( pcmo ) and srruo@xmath2 ( sro ) layers .",
    "bulk sro is an itinerant ferromagnet with orthorhombic crystal structure ( space group pbnm , lattice parameters @xmath4  nm , @xmath5  nm , @xmath6  nm ) and a curie temperature of about 160  k.@xcite bulk pcmo has orthorhombic symmetry ( pbnm , @xmath7  nm , @xmath8  nm , @xmath9  nm ) ; it has a complex magnetic behavior and phase diagram , and for 30% ca doping several transitions occur upon cooling , with an insulating canted ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic state below @xmath10  k @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the crystalline symmetry of the individual layers .",
    "this is a formidable task , since the layer thickness is below 5  nm and since the orthorhombic distortions from the pseudocubic cell are at maximum @xmath11% for sro and @xmath12% for pcmo .",
    "this task was tackled by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as angular - dependent magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements .",
    "since pcmo is insulating , the mr measurements only probe the sro layers .",
    "we have shown before that the crystalline symmetry of orthorhombic sro single layers could be accurately studied by angular mr measurements , revealing a monoclinic distortion of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-axes@xcite that was also observed in high - resolution x - ray diffractometry.@xcite",
    "pcmo / sro sls were fabricated by pulsed - laser deposition at a temperature of @xmath15c and in an oxygen partial pressure of @xmath16  mbar .",
    "vicinal srtio@xmath2 @xmath17 single crystal substrates with a low miscut angle of about @xmath18 were used for the growth , after being etched in buffered hf and annealed at @xmath19c for 2  hours in air .",
    "this treatment assured substrate surfaces with atomically flat terraces of a width between 100 and 500  nm separated by unit - cell high steps .",
    "the sls consisted of fifteen pcmo / sro bilayers with various layer thicknesses , see table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".samples studied in this work . for all samples",
    "the curie temperature of the sro layers was @xmath20  k and the nel temperature of the pcmo layers was @xmath21  k. [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have shown by a combination of two techniques , namely high - resolution transmission electron microscopy and angular dependent magnetoresistance measurements , that the srruo@xmath2 layers in a pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2/srruo@xmath2 superlattice undergo a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal structure , when the thickness of the pcmo layers is increased from 1.5 to 4  nm .",
    "the orthorhombic @xmath22-axis of the sro layers was found to lie in - plane , whereas the tetragonal @xmath22-axis of the sro layers seemed to be oriented along the sl normal ; for the tetragonal orientation , however , the existence of crystallographic domains with in - plane @xmath22-axis can not be fully excluded .",
    "the results impressively demonstrate that this structural phase transition has a large impact on the magnetotransport properties .",
    "this is surprising , since the actual atomic displacements between the phases are rather small .    what drives this phase transition ?",
    "an obvious candidate in case of thin films and superlattices is the strain .",
    "indeed , the transition temperature for the orthorhombic(o)-to - tetragonal(t ) transition was found to be substantially lowered in compressively strained sro films grown on srtio@xmath2@xmath23.@xcite since pcmo has an even smaller lattice constant than sto , a further lowering of the ot - transition temperature might be expected ; furthermore , the strain exerted by the pcmo layers is not biaxial , but anisotropic , which might also modify the strain effect .",
    "since we observed the tetragonal structure of the sro layers down to 10  k , this would mean that the strain effect had lowered the ot - transition temperature basically to zero .",
    "although this scenario is not excluded , it might appear unlikely . in an alternative scenario",
    "the ot - transition might be influenced by the electronic or magnetic coupling between the pcmo and sro layers . here",
    "it would be interesting for future research to look for structural anomalies in these superlattices near the magnetic transition at 110  k and the charge ordering transition near 240  k.@xcite    this work was supported by the german science foundation ( dfg ) within the collaborative research center sfb 762 `` functionality of oxide interfaces '' .",
