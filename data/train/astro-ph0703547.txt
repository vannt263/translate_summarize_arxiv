    "the investigation of the epoch of first structure formation in the early universe is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern cosmology . the observational data on the physical conditions during the growth of the first structures ,",
    "if detected , would give us extremely important information on the fundamental problems of the early universe , such as inflation , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) models ( see for example the review by @xcite and references therein ) , the formation of the first mini - galaxies ( see @xcite ; for a review , as well as @xcite and reference therein ) , first miniquasars @xcite and popiii stars @xcite . as has been discussed in previous works , the most promising way to investigate this epoch , is to search for the spectral spatial fluctuations ( ssf ) , produced by the primordial molecules in the spectra of the cmbr through resonant scattering of the cmbr photons .",
    "recently , the possibility of detecting these lines with odin and herschel satellites has been investigated by @xcite . they have also discussed the current observational situation for molecules based on the light elements . for further details , see @xcite , and the most recent calculations of the ssf due to the @xmath1 molecule in @xcite . it must be stressed here that in the case of deviation from the simple equilibrium evolution of the universe , the abundance of light elements in some regions of the universe can increase ( see for example possible production of deuterium by cascades from energetic antiprotons considered in the paper of @xcite ) , that can lead to the observability of such regions .",
    "the ssf from molecules based on the light elements ( such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in the primordial gas has been discussed by many authors during the last decade .",
    "but , perhaps light elements are not the only species capable of leaving footprints in radio . in recent years",
    ", models of non - standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( nbbn ) and new physics have attracted considerable attention , motivated in part for the discrepancies that remain between the abundance measurements of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the nbbn models predict a wide range of abundance for the heavy elements , which could be used to discriminate , combined with future observational results , among the alternative models . in this regard , and for reasons that will be discussed in this paper ,",
    "the abundance of primordial carbon appears to be of particular interest .",
    "one obvious reason , is related to the peak in abundance for the @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 group , whose height has a strong dependence on the nbbn model . in particular , the @xmath11 relative abundance can vary from @xmath12 for the standard bbn ( see for example @xcite ) , up to 10@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "recently the model of inhomogeneous bbn has been revisited by @xcite , where the relative abundance of @xmath11 has been found to be of the order of @xmath14 @xcite . besides , the nonequilibrium cosmological nucleosynthesis discussed in the papers of @xcite and @xcite can still further increase its abundance .",
    "the chemistry of the early universe has also been a subject of investigation in the last few years . for",
    "a review on this topic one may read @xcite and more recently , the results for the deuterium chemistry in @xcite .",
    "but little effort has been done so far to consider the assumption of the nbbn , for which , the chemistry of heavy elements has to be included .",
    "recently , the chemistry of the primordial carbon and oxygen in the early universe was calculated @xcite and the possibility of direct observations of the @xmath15 molecules formed in the first haloes was discussed @xcite .",
    "it needs to be stressed that not just primordial carbon should be taken into consideration , but also carbon produced by primeval sn .",
    "first stars ( popiii ) possibly appear at @xmath16 , and must significantly enrich the environment with heavy elements .",
    "for example , @xcite , consider a model in which the relative abundance of @xmath11 at @xmath17 due to feedback can reach a value of @xmath18/[h]=10^{-4}$ ] .",
    "it should also be noted , that the formation epoch of the first stars can be pushed back to even higher redshifts due to the presence of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays which stimulated the formation of the first stellar objects , as it has been recently suggested by @xcite . if this is the case , one can consider significant abundance of carbon at very early epochs .",
    "it is for these reasons , that the search for primordial carbon is of special interest .",
    "on the one hand , the detection of primordial ch would help us discriminate among the nbbn models . on the other , it would allow us to obtain important information about the formation of first structures in the universe ( such as minigalaxies , first stars , etc . ) .",
    "the @xmath15 molecule is an excellent species for this aim due to several reasons :    1)@xmath11 is rather sensitive to the nbbn model .",
    "2)it is argued here that @xmath8 stands a better chance for primordial chemistry than the other two species in the @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 abundance peak of the bbn element distribution .",
    "although @xmath9 has an abundance a little bit higher than @xmath8 , its negative ion @xmath19 has a binding energy an order of magnitude lower than that of @xmath20 , and the ratios for @xmath21 molecule formation are quite low .",
    "with respect to oxygen , its relative abundance is much lower compared with that of @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) and the molecules based on primordial oxygen are less interesting than those of @xmath15 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "3)@xmath15 has a rather high dissociation energy ( 3.46 ev ) and a large dipole moment .",
    "4)because of the rather low densities in the cosmological gas there is no depletion chain @xmath22 , like the one that exists in the interstellar medium .",
    "for this reason , the kinetics of the ism is significantly different to the cosmological one .",
    "several facilities being planned or under construction will cover the submillimeter and millimeter wavelength ranges with high sensitivity .",
    "examples of these are alma , carma , and the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) , under construction in mexico , whose radiometers will cover the range from 0.8 to 3 mm",
    ". the redshifted rotational lines of the primordial ch molecule are expected to fall in the mm region , and the optical depths for first structures are estimated to be rather high .",
    "the feasibility of detecting ch in the near future , is one of the main motivations for doing detailed calculations for this molecule .",
    "the aim of the present work is to draw attention to the problem of heavy elements in the early universe , and to emphasize on the extremely important role primordial carbon can play in the investigation of the pregalactic epoch , as well as in the bbn models . here",
    "we present for the first time , the complete chemistry of primordial carbon and calculate the expected footprints of first structure under formation in the rotational lines of the ch molecule on the basis of the @xmath23 - cold dark matter ( @xmath23 cdm ) scenario of cosmic structure formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we present the chemistry of primordial carbon in the early universe . in the third , the observational parameters for first haloes in the dark age epoch are introduced .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are discussed in the fourth section .",
    "the chemistry of the light elements under the standard bbn model has been discussed in several papers ( see for instance , the review paper @xcite ) and will not be discussed in any detail here .",
    "recently the chemistry of fluorine in the early universe was investigated by @xcite ( see also references therein for the standard light element chemistry ) .",
    "the chemistry of the primordial carbon and oxygen in the early universe was considered for the first time in @xcite . in the present work the primordial carbon chemistry",
    "is revisited to make it more complete and up - to - date with more recent data for the molecular processes . within the framework of the @xmath23 cdm universe , the parameters adopted for the calculations are as follows : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 km s@xmath28mpc@xmath28 .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "standard bbn yields of the light elements are assumed for simplicity , since their deviation from the standard values do not significantly affect the carbon chemistry .",
    "the kinetic equation of the system written in terms of the redshift @xmath29 is given by the following expression : @xmath30 ,   \\label{qs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the density of the gas in the present epoch , @xmath33 are the dimensionless relative abundance for the @xmath34 species ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 are the rates of the collisional processes @xmath37 , as functions of the kinetic temperature @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the rates of the radiative processes ( formation and destruction of the molecules by the cmbr photons characterized by the radiative temperature @xmath40 ) . to calculate the kinetic temperature @xmath41 we need to solve the following equation :    @xmath42    here , the first right - hand term is for the hubble expansion of the universe , the second one corresponds to heating ( @xmath43 ) , or cooling ( @xmath44 ) of the gas by absorption or emission , the third term describes the heating ( cooling ) of the medium in exothermic ( endothermic ) chemical reactions , the forth one appears here to take into account the change of the primordial gas density due to chemical reactions which do not conserve the number of initial species .",
    "the last term is due to thomson scattering .",
    "these equations solve the problem of molecular kinetics at the pregalactic epoch .",
    "let us now consider the formation ( destruction ) processes in more detail .",
    "for the present calculations , whenever appropriate we simply adopt the rate constant coefficients listed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "but a few important reactions were missed there , and for others , we have found more appropriate values for the rate constants .",
    "for this reason , in these calculations we include some new processes and adopt a new set of ratio constants .",
    "as it is well known for the case of hydrogen chemistry at low redshifts , the formation of the molecular hydrogen through the negative ion @xmath45 is an important mechanism .",
    "for this reason it is of particular interest to follow the formation - destruction processes for the negative carbon ion @xmath20 .",
    "this is a rather stable ion , with a binding energy @xmath46 ( for comparison , the binding energy of @xmath45 is @xmath47 ) .",
    "it is destroyed by the radiative photodetachment process :    @xmath48    the rate for this reaction has been computed from the corresponding crossection published by @xcite and it is in excellent agreement with experimental data . the threshold energy for this process is 1.25 ev , and the rate coefficient is given by the following expression :    @xmath49\\ ] ]    which is used in our calculations .",
    "this is the main channel for the c- negative ion formation and it is given by the reaction :    @xmath50    the crossection and the rate coefficient for this process were calculated by @xcite , but these authors were interested only in the low temperature region , thus retained in the expansion for the crossection only the first corresponding terms .",
    "this leads to incorrect behavior of the rate coefficient at high temperatures @xmath51 , if compared with those for the h- negative ion .",
    "namely , it decreases and abruptly drops at @xmath52 , which approximately corresponds to redshift z=500 . for this reason ,",
    "we need to calculate this rate coefficient for a wider range of temperatures , from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "we have calculated this rate coefficient in our paper @xcite by using the principle of detailed balance and crossection for the inverse process - photodetachment ( see above ) , as suggested by @xcite . in this way",
    ", we obtain a rate coefficient which has the correct behavior with the kinetic temperature ( approximately constant ) , like those for the hydrogen radiative attachment ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it can be approximately described by the following expression :    @xmath56,\\ ] ]    which has been adopted in our model .",
    "there are two process of associative detachment of interest .",
    "the first one is    @xmath57    and the second is    @xmath58    these were adopted in our calculations with the rate constant @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 $ ] respectively from the umist data base .      beside those mentioned above",
    ", we revisited and incorporated another process which was not taken into account in our previous calculation @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned in that paper , the main channel for the ch molecule formation ( destruction ) are the neutral - neutral reactions @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the most recent review and data on these processes was presented by @xcite ( see also references therein ) .    as discussed by @xcite one of the most important channels for the ch molecule formation ,",
    "is the @xmath64 reaction .",
    "it was investigated in detail in @xcite , where the crossection for this process was proposed , and reported to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the rate coefficient for this reaction is given by the following expression    @xmath65,\\ ] ]    the inverse process @xmath66  is the main channel of destruction for the ch molecule .",
    "the most recent theoretical data on crossections and rate coefficients were suggested by @xcite , where a comparison with the experimental data was also made ( see references therein ) .",
    "the most recent experimental data on this rate constant increases from @xmath67 @xmath68 at @xmath69 to @xmath70 @xmath71  at @xmath72 .",
    "this fact suggests a small barrier of about @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the rate constant for this reaction , adopted in our calculations can be represented by the following expression    @xmath74,\\ ] ]    which is in good agreement with experimental results for the rate constant of this process .",
    "it should be noted here that in the umist database for astrochemistry , a different expression for this rate constant is adopted , but that it presents a discrepancy of almost an order of magnitude with the experimental results , as well as with the theoretical one for a temperature of 300k , and for these reasons it was unacceptable to use such rate for these calculations .",
    "the calculations of the molecular abundance were carried out for a wide range of redshifts for the following species involved in the ch molecule formation : @xmath2 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath45 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath4 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath20 .",
    "other species are negligible in the formation processes of the ch molecule because of their small abundance . in our calculations",
    "we use the hydrogen and helium abundance according to the standard bbn and did not take into consideration deuterium and litium , due to their insignificant role in the ch molecule production .",
    "we include helium because of the importance of the @xmath81  molecular ion in the production of @xmath77  by the chain of reactions @xmath99 ; @xmath100 .",
    "the bbn carbon abundance was adopted from the paper of @xcite to be equal @xmath18/[h]=10^{-9}$ ] .",
    "it is an estimation which can easily be changed to other abundance ratios , because it appears linearly in the equations .",
    "the results of the calculation are shown in fig . 1 for the range of redshift from @xmath101 and up to @xmath102 .",
    "the relative abundance of the @xmath15 molecule is shown by a solid line and all the others by dashed lines .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath4 abundance are not shown in fig .",
    "1 , since they are approximately constant , and in this way it is possible choose a more convenient scale to see the curves for @xmath15 , @xmath87 , etc . in more detail .    one can readily see in fig .",
    "1 , that the relative abundance ratio @xmath103/[h]$ ] at low redshifts can be as high as a fraction of @xmath104  in the case of an homogeneous medium . but",
    "naturally , inside a protoobject , the gas density is expected to be higher , and so the chemistry must be faster and the relative abundance of the @xmath15 molecule will appear somewhere in the range between @xmath104  and @xmath60 . to finalize , it should be noted that the so called `` minimum model '' of @xmath15 chemistry , suggested in @xcite is incomplete at low temperatures , and more species ( such as @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath20 ) must be included in the calculations .",
    "it is well known that the largest resonant line opacities in homogeneous mass perturbations are produced when they are at their maximum expansion or turn - around epoch ( linear stage of their evolution ) , when all parts of the protocloud participate in the line formation process .",
    "let us estimate the detectability of line features of the primordial @xmath15 molecule in protostructures still in their linear or about - linear evolution regime , i.e. before gravitational collapse and first star formation occurs .",
    "here we calculate the ch resonant line opacities only at the turnaround epoch for cdm high - density ( @xmath105 ) mass perturbations .",
    "the interaction of cmbr photons with the primordial molecules inside these protostructures will produce spectral - spatial signatures in the cmbr spectrum , containing information on the physical conditions of the gas prior to the formation of the first stars and minigalaxies in the universe .",
    "the optical depths of primordial protoclouds in the rotational lines of ch molecule were calculated using the spherical top - hat approach ( see for example @xcite , to obtain the epoch , density , and size of the cdm mass perturbations at their maximum expansion , for the @xmath23cdm cosmology . we have discussed the top - hat approach in our previous paper ( see @xcite ) , and the parameters of the first structures listed in table 1 and table 2 of that paper will be used here .",
    "table 2 , in particular , presents the parameters we need for @xmath106 halos such as the turn - around redshift , size of protoclouds , density etc .    the optical depth for a protocloud of size @xmath107 is given by : @xmath108where",
    "the integration is carried out over the line of sight and @xmath109  is the absorption coefficient given by the following expression : @xmath110here @xmath111  is the wavelength , @xmath112  is the rotational quantum number , @xmath113  is the relative abundance of the @xmath15 molecule shown in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath114  is the population of @xmath112-th rotational level at epoch @xmath29 , and @xmath115  is the einstein coefficient .    by using these expressions",
    ", we calculate the @xmath15 line optical depths corresponding to protohalos of several masses at their turnaround redshifts .",
    "the result is shown in fig . 2 for three ground rotational line transitions 3/2(@xmath116)-1/2(@xmath116 ) , 5/2(@xmath116)-3/2(@xmath117 ) and 3/2(@xmath118)-1/2(@xmath116 ) for the @xmath119 first halos .",
    "as we can see , the values of the optical depth for the @xmath15 molecular lines are much larger than those reported for the hd molecule @xcite and reach values @xmath120 for redshift @xmath121 .",
    "let us now estimate some observational parameters for the first structures in the @xmath15 rotational lines .",
    "the temperature fluctuations of the cmbr due to the resonance scattering of the cmbr photons by moving protoclouds is : @xcite@xmath122here @xmath123 is the peculiar velocity of the protocloud at epoch @xmath29 with respect to the cmbr , @xmath124 is the speed of light , and @xmath125  is the corresponding optical depth of the protocloud at epoch @xmath126 .",
    "the linear theory of gravitational instability shows that the peculiar velocity of every mass element grows with the expansion factor as @xmath127 . an accurate approximation to this expression for a flat universe with a cosmological constant",
    "is suggested in the papers @xcite and @xcite . the value of the peculiar velocity at the present epoch @xmath128 km / s , adopted in our calculation , was taken from @xcite , @xcite . by using this expression and the @xmath15 optical depths shown at fig .",
    "2 , one can estimate with eq .",
    "( deltat ) the temperature fluctuation of the cmbr secondary anisotropies . in our case for the redshift @xmath129 , for the case of the @xmath106 protohalos",
    ", we obtain that @xmath130 in the 5/2 - 3/2 rotational transition at the laboratory wavelength @xmath131 , whereas for the case of collapsed halos this value can be higher .",
    "let us now estimate the integration time required for the detection of the secondary anisotropies with modern telescopes ( such as alma , carma or lmt / gtm ) .",
    "the observational time @xmath132  can be estimated from the equation @xmath133where @xmath134  is the bandwidth , @xmath135 is the noise temperature and @xmath136  is the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations calculated above .",
    "for @xmath134 we adopt an estimation @xmath137 and @xmath138 k. thus , for the @xmath106 protohalos , the integration time required for an observable signal of the rotational transitions of ch molecules is estimated to be @xmath139  hours , which can be divided into 10 - 20 sets of observations near the north ( south ) pole regions .",
    "it should be stressed here that for the case of collapsed gas inside virialized @xmath140 halos , previous to star formation triggering ( see for detail the discussion in @xcite ) , the integration time needed for the detection of the rotational lines of the primordial ch molecule , can be reduced to up to a few hours .    to conclude this part , the angular size of the objects must be mentioned .",
    "the first halos discussed in the present paper are actually the same considered in our previous paper @xcite , for which the signatures of the hd primordial molecule were investigated .",
    "for this reason we do not need any special consideration here and can refer to fig . 3 in that paper .",
    "it should be noted that the angular size for all protoclouds reaching their maximum expansion in the redshift range of @xmath141 ( this corresponds roughly to a mass range of @xmath142 and @xmath143 for the @xmath140 and @xmath106 cases , respectively ) appears within the observable region of alma and carma .",
    "in the present paper we present for the first time the calculation of the kinetics of the primordial @xmath15 molecule and the observational estimates for protohalos during the first structure formation epoch , which can possibly be observed in the @xmath15 molecule rotational lines . the signature of the first structure formation epoch is actually the spectral - spatial fluctuations in the cmbr spectrum due to the elastic resonant scattering of the cmbr by primordial @xmath15 molecules in its rotational structure .",

    "this difference , if compared with the interstellar medium , can be explained in terms of the rather low abundance of primordial gas and carbon . it must be stressed that in the presence of inhomogeneites , the ch molecule abundance increases , so that in this sense , these calculations can be considered as lower limit estimations .",

    "\\4 ) for testing nbbn models , the @xmath15 molecule is a more efficient tool in searches for signatures of the first structure formation epoch , than the @xmath1 molecule , discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ch rotational lines ( even if not detected ) would allow us to discriminate between the nbbn models .",
    "the optical depth of first halos in rotational lines of @xmath15 in the case of nbbn model discussed in the paper of @xcite , is larger than that for @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath154 .",

    "in this case the relative abundance of @xmath11 at @xmath17 due to feedback can reach @xmath18/[h]=10^{-4}$ ] @xcite , an abundance that is expected to be detected with modern radiotelescopes .    to conclude",
    ", we would like to stress again that the optical depths in the rotational lines of the ch molecule from the first structures depend strongly on the models of nbbn and structure formation , and that in some cases these lines might be observable today , whereas for others it is not yet possible . in any case , this work emphasizes the need to search for signatures of these objects in order to find them or , at least , to put upper limits to constrain scenarios of formation and nbbn models .",

    "<S> the carbon chemistry during the pregalactic epoch is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the relative abundance of the ch molecule is found to be 10(-14 ) whereas the adopted [ c]/[h ] ratio was taken to be 10(-10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical depth , dt / t and integration times are estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated optical depth turns out to have high values , that argue in favor of this molecule as an excellent candidate in searches for first structure formation . </S>",
