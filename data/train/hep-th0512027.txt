    "the construction of a quantized theory which incorporate gravity remains one of the priorities of theoretical physicists .",
    "unfortunately all the attempts toward this goal fail .",
    "the reason is that the planck scale @xmath0 , at which the effects of quantum gravity reveal themselves is so small , that these effects are neglected in experimentally accessible energies .",
    "recently , to cure this problem , different scenarios have been proposed and all leading to a significant lowering of planck s scale . among them , models with large extra dimensions ( lxd ) @xcite , non commutative field theory models @xcite and models with non zero minimal lengths @xcite . in this paper",

    "a non zero minimal length in position has first appeared in the context of perturbative string theory @xcite .",
    "one major feature of this finding is that the physics below such a scale becomes inaccessible and then define a natural cut - off which prevents from the usual uv divergencies .",
    "the other consequence of such gup is the appearance of an intriguing uv / ir mixing , first noticed in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . physically the uv / ir mixing means that we can probe short distances physics by long distances physics .",
    "we point that the uv / ir mixing is also a feature of non commutative quantum field theory @xcite . on the other  hand some scenarios have been proposed where non zero minimal length is related to large extra dimensions @xcite , to the running coupling constant @xcite and to the physics of black holes production @xcite .",
    "recently the cosmological constant problem and the classical limit of the physics with minimal length have been investigated by the group of virginia tech @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the value of the minimal length is so small that it seems meaningful .",
    "the size of the minimal length have been also extracted from the energy spectrum of the coulomb potential @xcite and from the energy spectrum of electrons in a trap @xcite .     on the other hand",
    "the casimir force has been calculated in a model incorporating one large extra dimension @xcite .",
    "the comparison with available experimental data gives @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the size of the compactified extra dimension .",
    "motivated by the fact that large extra dimensions and minimal lengths models aim to lower planck s scale and can be related to each others we calculate in this paper , the effect of the presence of a minimal length on the casimir force between parallel plates .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , implementing the minimal length using standard methods of quantum mechanics we obtain generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , generalized plane waves and modified closure relations . in section iii , we quantify the electromagnetic field and then following the standard recipe we calculate the casimir force between to parallel plates .",

    "a minimization of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 gives the following non zero minimal length@xmath10 eq.@xmath11 , like the uv / ir mixing , reveals the non local character of models based on eqs.(1 - 3 ) .",
    "then we have not localized eigenfunctions in the @xmath12-space .",
    "so , any eigenvalue problem can be solved by going to the momentum space.in the following we derive necessary relations for our calculation taking in mind that we must recover the usual quantum mechanics in the limit @xmath13 .",
