    "this text is an expanded version of the lecture notes for a minicourse that i gave at a summer school called `` advanced course on geometry and dynamics of integrable systems '' organized by vladimir matveev , eva miranda and francisco presas at centre de recerca matemtica ( crm ) barcelona , 914/september/2013 . the aim of this minicourse is to present some geometrical aspects of integrable _ non - hamiltonian _ systems . here",
    "the adjective non - hamiltonian does not mean that the systems in question can not be hamiltonian , it simply means that we consider general dynamical systems which may or may not admit a hamiltonian structure , and even when they are hamiltonian we can sometimes forget about their hamiltonian nature .",
    "the notion of integrability for hamiltonian systems can be traced back to a paper of joseph liouville in 1855 @xcite , some 160 years ago . compared to that",
    ", the similar notion of integrability for more general dynamical ( non - hamiltonian ) systems is very young . though integrable non - hamiltonian systems , especially non - holonomic systems , have been studied since more than a century ago by people like chaplygin , suslov , routh , etc .",
    ", it is only in the 1990s that people started writing explicitly about the notion of integrability in the non - hamiltonian context .",
    "some of the earlier papers on this subject are fedorov and kozlov 1995 @xcite , bogoyavlenskij 1998 @xcite , dragovic , gajic and jovanovic 1998 @xcite bates and cushman 1999 @xcite , stolovitch 2000 @xcite , cushman and duistermaat 2001 @xcite , etc .",
    "many more articles on integrable non - hamiltonian systems have appeared recently , including a whole issue of the journal regular and chaotic dynamics @xcite , with papers by borisov , bolsinov , mamaev , kilin , kozlov and other people .",
    "these papers provide a lot of interesting examples of integrable non - hamiltonian systems , from the more simple ( e.g. rolling disks , rolling balls , chinese tops , chaplygin s skates ) to the more complicated ones .    though different people arrive at integrable non - hamiltonian systems from different points of view",
    ", they converge at the following definition , which was probably first written down explicitly by bogoyavlenskij @xcite who called it _ broad integrability _ : a dynamical system is called integrable if it admits a sufficiently large family of commuting vector fields and common first integrals .",
    "more precisely , we have :    [ defn : integrable ] a vector field @xmath1 on a manifold @xmath2 is said to be * integrable of type @xmath3 * , where @xmath4 , if there exist @xmath5 vector fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 functions @xmath8 on @xmath2 which satisfy the following conditions :    \\i ) the vector fields @xmath9 commute pairwise : @xmath1 : @xmath10    \\ii ) the functions @xmath11 are common first integrals of @xmath12 : @xmath13    \\iii ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 almost everywhere .    under the above conditions , we will also say that @xmath16 is an * integrable system of type @xmath3*.    there are many reasons why the above definition of integrability for general dynamical systems is the _",
    "right _ one .",
    "let us list some of them here :    \\i ) hamiltonian systems on a symplectic @xmath17-dimensional manifold which are integrable in the sense of liouville are also integrable of type @xmath18 in the above sense ( i.e. @xmath19 commuting first integrals together with their @xmath19 commuting hamiltonian vector fields ) .",
    "hamiltonian systems which are integrable in various generalized senses , e.g. non - commutatively integrable hamiltonian systems in the sense of fomenko",
    " mischenko @xcite , are also integrable in the sense of the above definition .",
    "conversely , the _ cotangent lifting _ of an integrable non - hamiltonian system is an integrable hamiltonian system in the sense of liouville @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) liouville s theorem @xcite is still valid for integrable non - hamiltonian systems . in particular , under an additional regularity and compactness condition , the movement of an integrable dynamical system is quasi - periodic , just like in the hamiltonian case .",
    "\\iii ) the theories of normal forms for hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian systems are essentially the same theory . in particular",
    ", an analytic integrable dynamical system always admits a local analytic normalization near a singular point , be it hamiltonian or not @xcite .",
    "an analytic hamiltonian vector field will admit a local analytic birkhoff normalization if and only if it admits a local analytic poincar  dulac normalization when forgetting about the hamiltonian structure @xcite .",
    "\\iv ) many other results in the theory of integrable systems do not need the hamiltonian structure either .",
    "in particular , morales  ramis ",
    "simo s theorem on galoisian obstructions to meromorphic integrability @xcite turns out to be valid also for non - hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "various topological invariants for integrable hamiltonian systems , e.g. the monodromy and the chern class ( see @xcite ) can be naturally extended to the case of integrable non - hamiltonian systems as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "\\v ) integrability in both classical and quantum mechanics means some kind of commutativity , and definition [ defn : integrable ] fits well into this philosophy .",
    "in fact , the equation @xmath20 can be rewritten as @xmath21 = 0 $ ] using the schouten bracket . if one considers the functions @xmath22 as zeroth - order linear differential operators , and the vector fields @xmath23 as first - order linear differential operators on the space of functions on the manifold @xmath2 , then the conditions @xmath24 = 0 $ ] and @xmath20 mean that these @xmath25 differential operators commute , like in the case of a quantum integrable system .",
    "\\vi ) sometimes it is useful to forget about the symplectic or poisson structure and consider integrable hamiltonian systems on the same footing as more general integrable dynamical systems . in particular",
    ", we will show in subsections [ subsub : structurepreserving ] and [ subsub : aa ] a simple , short , and conceptual proof of the existence of action - angle variables using this approach .",
    "the above points show mainly the similarities between hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "now let us indicate some differences between them :    \\a ) the class of integrable non - hamiltonian systems is much larger than the class of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "there are many problems coming from control theory , economics , biology , etc . which are a priori non - hamiltonian , but which can still be integrable .",
    "not every integrable system admits a hamiltonian structure , and the problem of hamiltonization is a very interesting and non - trivial problem , even in the case of dimension 2 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "\\b ) the geometry and topology of integrable non - hamiltonian systems is much richer than that of integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "in particular , there are manifolds which do not admit any symplectic structure but which admit nondegenerate integrable non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "integrable non - hamiltonian systems also admit many kinds of interesting singularities which are not available for hamiltonian systems .",
    "\\c ) being hamiltonian has its advantages .",
    "for example , noether s theorem about the relationship between symmetries and first integrals needs the symplectic form , and there is no analogue of this theorem in the non - hamiltonian case .",
    "there are also machanisms of integrability which are specific to hamiltonian systems , e.g. the fact that bi - hamiltonian systems are automatically integrable under some mild additional assumptions .",
    "\\d ) for hamiltonian systems , reduction ( with respect to symmetry groups ) commutes with integrability , i.e. a proper symmetric hamiltonian system is integrable if and only if the reduced system is integrable . on the other hand , a non - hamiltonian system which becomes integrable after",
    "a reduction is not necessarily integrable before reduction , see @xcite .    in this text",
    ", we will concentrate on two aspects of integrable dynamical systems that i m most familiar with .",
    "namely , in section 2 , we will study local and semi - local normal forms and associated torus actions for integrable systems , and in section 3 we will study the geometry of integrable systems of type @xmath0 .",
    "this class of systems of type @xmath0 is a particular but very important class in the geometric study of integrable systems , because every integrable system becomes a system of type @xmath0 when restricted to a common level set of the first integrals .",
    "in 1855 , liouville @xcite showed that if a hamiltonian system @xmath26 on a symplectic manifold @xmath27 is integrable with a momentum map @xmath28 , @xmath29 , then each connected component of a compact regular level set of the momentum map @xmath30 is diffeomorphic to an @xmath31-dimensional torus on which the vector fields @xmath32 are constant , i.e. are invariant with respect to the action of the torus on itself by translations .",
    "each such connected level set @xmath33 is called a * liouville torus*. the torus @xmath34 acts not only on @xmath33 , but also on the nearby liouville tori by the same arguments , and so we have a torus @xmath34-action in a tubular neigborhood of @xmath33 , which preserves @xmath32 , and whose orbits are regular connected compact level sets of the momentum map .",
    "this torus action is called the * liouville torus action * near @xmath33 .",
    "liouville s theorem can be naturally extended to the case of integrable non - hamiltonian systems :    [ thm : liouville ] assume that @xmath35 is an integrable system of type @xmath3 on a manifold @xmath2 which is regular at a compact level set @xmath33 .",
    "then in a tubular neighborhood @xmath36 there is , up to automorphisms of @xmath37 , a unique free torus action @xmath38 which preserves the system ( i.e. the action preserves each @xmath23 and each @xmath39 ) and whose orbits are regular level sets of the system . in particular , @xmath33 is diffeomorphic to @xmath37 , and @xmath40 with periodic coordinates @xmath41 on @xmath37 and coordinates @xmath42 on a @xmath7-dimensional ball @xmath43 , such that @xmath11 depend only on the variables @xmath44 and the vector fields @xmath23 are of the type @xmath45    the proof of the above theorem is absolutely similar to the case of integrable hamiltonian systems on symplectic manifolds , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it consists of 2 main points : 1 ) the map @xmath46 from a tubular neighborhood of @xmath33 to @xmath47 is a topologically trivial fibration by the level sets , due to the compactness of @xmath33 and the regularity of @xmath48 ; 2 ) the vector fields @xmath9 generate a transitive action of @xmath49 on the level sets near @xmath33 , and the level sets are compact and of dimension @xmath5 , which imply that each level set is a @xmath5-dimensional compact quotient of @xmath49 , i.e. a torus .    similarly to the hamiltonian case , the regular level sets in the above theorem are called * liouville tori * , and the torus action is also called the * liouville torus action*. theorem [ thm : liouville ] shows that the flow of the vector field @xmath50 of an integrable system is * quasi - periodic * under some natural compactness and regularity conditions .",
    "this quasi - periodicity is the most fundamental geometrical property of proper integrable dynamical systems .",
    "there is also a version of theorem [ thm : liouville ] for integrable _ stochastic _ dynamical systems , see @xcite .",
    "one may suspect that a version of this liouville torus action exists for quantum systems as well .      the liouville torus actions , and other associated torus actions that we will discuss later in this section , preserve not only the system , but has the following much stronger * structure preserving property * : roughly speaking , anything which is preserved by the system",
    "is also be preserved by these torus actions . in other words",
    ", one may view these torus actions as a kind of * double commutant*. more precisely , we have :    [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] let @xmath51 be a smooth integrable system of type @xmath3 on a manifold @xmath2 with a liouville torus @xmath52 .",
    "suppose that @xmath53 is a smooth tensor field which satisfies at least one of the following two additional conditions :    \\i ) @xmath54 is invariant with respect to the vector fields @xmath55 .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath54 is invariant with respect to the viector field @xmath56 , and moreover the orbits of @xmath56 are dense in a dense family of liouville tori in a tubular neighborhood of @xmath33 . in other words , if we write @xmath57 in a canonical coordinate system as in formula [ eqn : xinaa ] , then for a dense family of the values of @xmath42 , the numbers @xmath58 are incommensurable .",
    "then the tensor field @xmath54 is also invariant with respect to the liouville torus @xmath37-action in a tubular neighborhood of @xmath33 .",
    "the tensor field @xmath54 in the above theorem can be of any nature .",
    "for example , when @xmath54 is an infinitesimal generator of a lie group action , we obtain that if a connected lie group action preserves the system then it commutes with the liouville torus action . when the system is osochore , i.e. preserves a volume form , then that volume form is also preserved by the liouville torus action , etc .",
    "we will assume that condition ii ) is satisfied .",
    "( the case when condition i ) is satisfied is absolutely similar ) . fix a canonical coordinate system @xmath59 in a tubular neighborhood @xmath36 of @xmath33 as given by theorem [ thm : liouville ] .",
    "we will make a filtration of the space @xmath60 of tensor fields of contravariant order @xmath61 and contravariant order @xmath62 as follows :    the subspace @xmath63 consists of sections of @xmath64 whose expression in the coordinates @xmath65 contains only terms of the type @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "for example , @xmath68 put @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath70 it is also clear that the above filtration is stable under the lie derivative of the vector field @xmath56 , i.e. we have @xmath71    since @xmath72 by our hypothesis , and the liouville torus action commutes with the vector field @xmath56 , we also have that @xmath73 where the overline means the average of a tensor with respect to the liouville torus action .",
    "thus we also have @xmath74 where @xmath75 has average equal to 0 .",
    "the equality @xmath76 implies that the coefficients of @xmath77 of the terms which are not in @xmath78 , i.e. the terms of the type @xmath79 are invariant with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "it means that these coefficient functions are constant on the orbits of @xmath56 . by continuity , it means that they are constant on liouville tori for which the orbits of @xmath56 are dense .",
    "but since the family of such liouville tori is dense in the space of all liouville tori near @xmath33 , it implies that these functions are constant on every liouville torus near @xmath33 , i.e. they are constant with respect to the liouville @xmath37-action in a neighborhood of @xmath33 . but any @xmath37-invariant function with average 0 is a trivial function , so in fact @xmath77 does not contain any term outside of @xmath80 i.e. we have : @xmath81 by the same arguments , one can verify that if @xmath82 with @xmath83 then in fact @xmath84 so by induction we have @xmath85 i.e. @xmath86 is invariant with respect to the liouville torus action .",
    "theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] and its method of proof can be extended to the case of other invariant structures , which are similar to tensor fields , but which are not tensor fields strictly speaking .",
    "in particular , an analogue of theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] for invariant dirac structures was in obtained @xcite , and probably an analogue of theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] for invariant contact structures ( without a contact 1-form ) is probably also true , with a similar proof .    in the case of linear differential operators",
    ", we also have the following result , whose proof is absolutely similar to the proof of theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] :    [ thm : actiondiff ] under the assumptions of theorem [ thm : liouville ] , let @xmath87 be a linear differential operator on @xmath2 which satisfies at least one of the following two conditions :    \\i ) @xmath87 is invariant with respect to @xmath88    \\ii ) @xmath87 in invariant with respect to @xmath56 , and moreover , the orbit of @xmath56 is dense in a dense family of orbits of the liouville @xmath89-action near @xmath90    then @xmath87 is invariant with respect to the liouville @xmath89-action in a neighborhood of @xmath90      in the case of integrable hamiltonian systems on symplectic manifolds , one can deduce easily from theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] the following famous theorem about the existence of action - angle variables :    [ thm : aa - classical ] if @xmath33 is a liouville torus of a integrable hamiltonian system on a symplectic manifold @xmath27 given by a momentum map @xmath91 then in a neigborhood @xmath36 of @xmath33 there is a canonical system of coordinates @xmath92 , called * action - angle variables * in which the functions @xmath93 are functions of the action variables @xmath94 only and the symplectic structure @xmath95 has the canonical form @xmath96 .",
    "remark that the above action - angle variables theorem was first proved by henri mineur in 1935 @xcite , though it is oftren called arnold  liouville theorem",
    ". it would be more appropriate to call it * liouville ",
    "mineur theorem*.    according to theorem [ thm : toruspreservesstructureii ] , the symplectic structure is preserved by the liouville torus @xmath34-action , because it is preserved by the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath97 of the system .",
    "but since @xmath33 is a lagrangian torus , i.e. the pull - back of @xmath95 to @xmath33 is trivial , the cohomology class of @xmath95 in a tubular neighborhood @xmath36 of @xmath33 is trivial , and so this action is a hamiltonian action in @xmath36 , i.e. it is given by a momentum map @xmath98 .",
    "define periodic coordinates @xmath99 on @xmath36 in such a way that the zero section @xmath100 is a lagrangian submanifold and @xmath101 for all @xmath102 .",
    "then one verifies easily that @xmath96 on @xmath103 .",
    "but since both forms are @xmath34-invariant , it implies that they are equal everywhere in a neighborhood of @xmath33 .",

    "indeed , asssume that there is such an action . denote by @xmath850 the vectors associated to the curves @xmath851 respectively . since @xmath852 form the fan of @xmath537 , we must have : @xmath853 for some @xmath854 .",
    "similarly , looking at the fan of @xmath855 , we have : @xmath856 for some @xmath857 . but looking at the fan of @xmath538 , we have that either @xmath858 or @xmath859 is a positive linear combination of @xmath860 and @xmath466 .",
    "this is contradiction .",
    "similarly , the configuration in figure [ fig:3domain]b is also impossible .          as of this writing",
    ", we do nt know if there is any obstruction to the existence of a totally hyperbolic @xmath419-action on an @xmath19-manifold when @xmath861 .",
    "we do nt even know whether simple manifolds such as 3-dimensional lense spaces admit a totally hyperbolic @xmath419-action . nevertheless ,",
    "we have the following abstract classification theorem , whose proof is straightforward :    [ class - hyp - invariants ] nondegenerate totally hyperbolic actions of @xmath419 on a connected @xmath19-manifold @xmath417 ( possibly with boundary and corners ) are completely determined by their invariants i1 , i2 , i3 listed below :    i1 ) the singular set : smooth invariant hypersurfaces of @xmath417 which intersect transversally and which cut @xmath417 into a finite number of `` curved polytopes '' , which are hyperbolic domains of the action .        in other words , assume that @xmath862 and @xmath863 are totally hyperbolic actions , such that there is a homeomorphism @xmath864 which sends hyperbolic domains of @xmath862 to hyperbolic domains of @xmath863 , such that the monodromy and the associated fans are preserved by @xmath865 , then there is a diffeomorphism @xmath866 which sends @xmath591 to @xmath599 .",
    "remark that the family of fans in the above theorem must satisfy the following compatibility condition : all the fans of the domains with share the same boundary hypersurface must also share the same vector associated to that hypersurface .",
    "this additional condition is also sufficient for the set of invariants to be realizable .        in the elbolic case ,",
    "the singular set of the action is of codimension 2 , hence the regular part is connected , which implies that the action has just one regular orbit .",
    "the rest of the proof of the following proposition is also straightforward :          \\3 ) the monodromy of @xmath421 is trivial , and the quotient space @xmath869 of @xmath417 by the induced torus action @xmath526 is a contractible manifold with boundary and corners , on which the reduced action @xmath556 is nondegenerate totally hyperbolic and has only one regular orbit .",
    "the case of elbolic actions with a fixed point is of special interest in geometry , because of its connection to toric manifolds .",
    "recall that , a * toric manifold * in the sense of complex geometry is a complex manifold ( which is often equipped with a klerian structure , or equivalently , a compatible symplectic structure ) of complex dimension @xmath31 together with a holomorphic action of the complex torus @xmath870 which has an open dense orbit .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for an introduction to toric manifolds . from our point of view , a complex toric manifold has real dimension @xmath871 , and the action of @xmath872 is an elbolic nondegenerate @xmath873-action .",
    "complex toric manifolds are classfied by their associated fans .",
    "so our classification of hyperbolic domains ( and of the quotient spaces of elbolic actions ) are very similar to the classification of complex toric manifolds , except that , unlike the complex case , the vectors of our fans are not required to lie in an integral lattice .",
    "there have been many generalizations of the notion of toric manifolds to the case of real manifolds . in particular , davis and januskiewicz introduced quasi - toric manifolds in 1991 @xcite . a * quasi - toric manifold * is a @xmath874-dimensional manifold with a almost - everywhere - free action of @xmath875 such that the quotient space @xmath876 is homeomorphic to a simple convex polytope ( like in the case of complex toric manifolds ) , and such that near each fixed point the action is locally isomorphic to a standard action of @xmath875 on @xmath201 .",
    "hattori and masuda introduced torus manifolds in 2003 @xcite .",
    "a * torus manifold * is simply a closed connected orientable smooth manifold @xmath2 of dimension @xmath874 with an effective smooth action of @xmath875 having a fixed point .",
    "ishida , fukukawa and masuda recently introduced the notion of topological toric manifolds in 2010 @xcite .",
    "a * topological toric manifold * is a closed smooth manifold @xmath2 of dimension @xmath871 with an almost - everywhere - free smooth action of @xmath877 which is covered by finitely many invariant open subsets each equivariantly diffeomorphic to a direct sum of complex 1-dimensional linear representation of @xmath878 . according to the results of @xcite , topological toric manifolds are _ the _ right generalization of the notion of toric manifolds to the category of real manifolds",
    "; they have very nice homological properties similarly to toric manifolds ( see section 8 of @xcite ) , and they are also classified by a generalized notion of fans .",
    "it turns out that ishida ",
    "masuda s notion of topological toric manifolds is equivalent to our notion of manifolds admitting an elbolic action whose toric degree is half the dimension of the manifold .",
    "the proof of the following proposition is a simple verification that their conditions and our conditions are the same :    a closed manifold @xmath879 , together with a smooth action of @xmath880 , is a topological toric manifold if and only if the action ( when viewed as an action of @xmath873 ) is elbolic of toric degree @xmath31 .    in @xcite ,",
    "topological toric manifolds are are classified by the so - called * complete non - singular topological fans * , which encode the following data : the complete fan in @xmath419 associated to the reduced totally hyperbolic action @xmath556 on the quotient space @xmath881 , and the vector couples associated to corank-2 transversally elbolic orbits ( see definition [ def : associatedvector ] ) .",
    "these vector couples tell us how to build back @xmath882 from @xmath584 .",
    "so one can recover ishida ",
    "masuda s classification theorem for topological toric manifolds from our point of view of general nondegenerate @xmath419-actions on @xmath19-manfiolds : one can prove this theorem in the same way as the proof of theorem [ thm : classificationbyfan ] , by gluing together local pieces equipped with canonical coordinates and adapted bases .",
