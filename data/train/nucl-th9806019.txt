    "experimental and theoretical studies of exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values are active areas of current research in nuclear physics .",
    "the advent of radioactive beams and the creation of several facilities to produce them have provided the opportunities to study the structure and properties of very short - lived nuclei with extreme neutron - to - proton @xmath1 ratios @xcite .    on the neutron - rich side ,",
    "exotic phenomena include ( i ) the weak binding of the outermost neutrons , ( ii ) pronounced effects of the coupling between bound states and the particle continuum , and ( iii ) regions of neutron halos with very diffuse neutron densities and major modifications in the shell structures .",
    "the situation is different on the proton - rich side of the stability valley . here",
    ", nuclei are stabilized by the coulomb barrier , which tends to localize the proton density in the nuclear interior , thereby preventing the formation of nuclei with large spatial extensions .",
    "the opportunities provided by the radioactive beam facilities make the study of the structure and properties of nuclei close to the proton drip line a very interesting topic from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "experimentally , possibilities for studying new decay modes such as diproton emission have opened up .",
    "theoretical studies allow further tests of the various models .",
    "of special interest is the region of @xmath2@xmath3-shell proton - rich nuclei @xcite where two - proton ground - state radioactivity @xcite is expected to occur . in particular , the region around @xmath4ni",
    "is expected to contain nuclei which are two - proton emitters .    in certain cases",
    "the proton drip line has been reached or even crossed experimentally .",
    "systematic theoretical studies predicting the positions of the proton drip line are therefore important and timely @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory is used to study the ground - state properties of very proton - rich , even - even nuclei with @xmath0 and to predict the location of the two - proton drip line .",
    "the rmf theory @xcite has proven to be a powerful tool to describe and predict the properties of nuclei .",
    "this theory provides an elegant and economical framework , in which properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei , as well as the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , can be calculated ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . compared to conventional nonrelativistic approaches ,",
    "relativistic models explicitly include mesonic degrees of freedom and describe the nucleons as dirac particles .",
    "moreover , the spin - orbit interaction arises naturally from the dirac - lorenz structure of the effective lagrangian .    in this work ,",
    "the calculations are performed in the axially - deformed configuration and the pairing correlations are accounted in the bcs formalism .",
    "it is known that the bcs description of the scattering of nucleonic pairs from bound states to the positive - energy particle continuum produces an unphysical component in the nucleon density with the wrong asymptotic behavior  @xcite .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for neutron - rich nuclei , for which the coupling to the particle continuum is particularly important .",
    "for proton - rich nuclei , however , the coulomb barrier confines the protons in the interior of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the effect of the coupling to the continuum is weaker , and , for nuclei close to the proton drip line , the rmf+bcs approach can still be considered as a reasonable approximation providing sufficiently accurate solutions .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the total energy is not affected seriously by this coupling . of course",
    ", it is more desirable if pairing correlations are described in the unified framework of the relativistic - hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) scheme [ or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) in the nonrelativistic approach ] , in which the nucleon densities have the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , numerical codes for deformed rhb calculations are not yet generally available .",
    "those appearing in published rhb ( hfb ) studies use spherical configurations @xcite . on the other hand , a detailed study of proton - rich nuclei within the deformed hf+bcs approach with the skyrme",
    "effective force siii has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "the current paper is the first systematic study of the proton drip - line nuclei over a wide range of @xmath5 values within the rmf+bcs model . in sec .",
    "ii , a brief description of the rmf formalism is given , while in sec .",
    "iii , the results of our calculations are presented and discussed .",
    "ground - state properties such as binding energies , two - proton separation energies , proton root - mean - square ( rms ) radii , and deformation parameters that result from fully self - consistent rmf solutions have been calculated for very proton - rich nuclei near the proton drip line . finally the prediction of the rmf theory for the location of the two - proton drip line is compared with those obtained from other theoretical models .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the proton drip line is delineated in a @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 plot by nuclei with the smallest positive value of the proton separation energy @xmath7 . to derive the global drip line",
    ", it is necessary to perform calculations for all nuclei , especially the odd-@xmath5 and odd-@xmath6 ones .",
    "the rmf calculations for these nuclei are very involved and take prohibitively long computing times .",
    "therefore , this work deals only with even - even nuclei and with the two - proton drip line defined by nuclei with the smallest positive value of the two - proton separation energy @xmath8 .",
    "this restriction is not too severe because it can be shown that the drip lines defined by @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nearly parallel , except that nuclei specified by the @xmath7 line tends , on the average , to have one or two fewer nucleons than those specified by the @xmath8 line .",
    "in relativistic quantum hadrodynamics the nucleons , described as dirac particles , are coupled to exchange mesons and photon through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the model is based on the one - boson exchange description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the lagrangian density of the model is given by @xcite    @xmath9    the dirac spinor @xmath10 denotes the nucleon with mass @xmath11 .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the masses of the @xmath15 meson , the @xmath16 meson , and the @xmath17 meson , respectively , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the corresponding coupling constants for the mesons to the nucleon . @xmath21 denotes the nonlinear @xmath15 self - interaction @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are field tensors  @xcite .    assuming time - reversal symmetry and charge conservation , the coupled equations of motion are derived from the langrangian density ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",

    "more details on the rmf formalism can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in this work , the dirac equation for nucleons is solved using the method of oscillator expansion as described in ref . @xcite . because most of the nuclei considered here are open - shell nuclei , both proton and neutron pairing correlations have been included .",
    "the bcs formalism was used for the pairing with constant pairing gaps obtained from the prescription of ref .",
    "the number of oscillator shells taken into account is 12 for fermionic and 20 for bosonic wave functions .",
    "the effective force nl3 was adopted for the calulations using a new version of the `` axially - deformed '' code @xcite .",
    "the parameter set nl3 has been derived recently  @xcite by fitting ground - state properties of ten spherical nuclei .",
    "properties predicted with the nl3 effective interaction are found to be in good agreement with experimental data @xcite for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath30 stability .",
    "the calculations have been performed for several nuclei close to the proton drip line for the even - even isotopic chains . in table",
    "i the calculated total binding energies for the three most proton - rich isotopes close to the drip line are listed for each element with atomic numbers ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "the experimental values ( in parentheses ) , if available , are also shown for comparison . with the exception of the binding energies for @xmath33zr , @xmath34sn , @xmath35hg , and @xmath36pb , which are from refs .",
    "@xcite , all other values are from the 1995 atomic mass adjustment @xcite .",
    "the rms deviation between calculation and experiment is only 3.1  mev .",
    "the larger differences are observed for @xmath37 nuclei .",
    "this observation might indicate that for these nuclei additional correlations should be taken into account @xcite . in particular , proton - neutron pairing could have a strong influence on the masses .",
    "proton - neutron short - range correlations are not included in our model .    in fig .",
    "1 , the two - proton separation energies @xmath38 are shown as function of the atomic number @xmath5 . in the upper panel",
    "are shown the two - proton separation energies @xmath8 for nuclei with @xmath39 , while in the lower panel are shown the corresponding values for nuclei with @xmath40 .",
    "each curve corresponds to a given neutron number which changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( upper panel ) and @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( lower panel ) in going from the left to the right of the figures .    in table",
    "ii are listed ( first column ) the predictions of the rmf theory for the most proton rich even - even nuclei ( with @xmath0 ) that are stable with respect to the two - proton emission , i.e. , @xmath45 . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding predictions of the hf+bcs mean - field theory ( second column ) with the effective force skyrme siii @xcite and of the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) model @xcite ( third column ) are also given .",
    "finally in the fourth column the lightest experimentally known , proton - stable nuclei are listed for each even-@xmath5 element .",
    "it is seen that the predictions of the various theoretical models are in accordance in most of the cases .",
    "whether such close agreement exists in the neutron - rich region is an open question .    in table iii ,",
    "the predictions of the rmf theory for the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath46 are shown for all nuclei listed in the first column of table i. it is seen that most of the nuclei close to the proton drip line are deformed , apart from those with magic proton ( neutron ) number , which are spherical or almost spherical .",
    "it turns out that the magic numbers maintain their character close to the proton drip line . in fig .",
    "2 , the trend of the variation of the quadropole deformation parameter @xmath46 of the most proton - rich even - even nuclei that are stable to two - proton emission is shown as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "table iii also gives the rmf predictions for the proton radii @xmath47 . unlike the other calculated ground - state properties , these @xmath47 values",
    "must be treated with some caution because , near the proton drip line , the bcs approach may not be a sufficiently good approximation for estimating proton radii .    in conclusion ,",
    "a systematic study of the properties of very proton - rich nuclei close to the drip line has been carried out .",
    "the location of the two - nucleon proton drip line has been predicted , which is in agreement with the predictions of other theoretical models . in 14 of 37 cases ( of even-@xmath5 elements )",
    ", the proton drip line has apparently been reached in a variety of experiments .",
    "the existing calculations ( see table ii ) suggest that there are approximately 60 unknown isotopes of even-@xmath5 elements in the @xmath0 region that are proton stable .",
    "the smallness of this number reflects the increased activity in this research area in recent years .",
    "the number of undiscovered isotopes in the neutron - rich side is , of course , much larger .",
    "calculations similar to those reported here have been carried out by us for over 1300 even - even nuclei on either side of the valley of stability .",
    "these results will be reported separately .",
