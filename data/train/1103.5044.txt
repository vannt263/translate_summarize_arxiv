    "spam in domains such as emails , web - pages , blogs , social networking websites , online discussion forums , wikis and video sharing websites is prevalent and naturally has several negative impacts such as undesirable consumption of computing resources , lowering the reputation or value of the targeted legitimate web application , impacting search engine rankings , overwhelming moderators and administrators , and obstructs and misleads genuine usage of legitimate users and community @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "content - based methods analyze the text of the post or message ( such as checking the presence of pre - defined terms or links ) in a forum and infer the likelihood of a message being spam or legitimate .                while content - based methods have shown encouraging results , they are not perfect and there is a strong need to augment or complement the capabilities of existing anti - spam content - based methods to counter the spam problem . based on our analysis of related body of work and literature , the research area of analyzing the _ commenting behavior _ or _",

    "hasspamhint_. we carefully observed ( based on manual and visual inspection ) several forums of several videos across various categories and notice many comments correctly tagged as hasspamhint ( wherein the comments are still visible ) .",
    "however , we also notice many ( significant percentage ) spam comments which are not tagged as hasspamhint ( perhaps due to practical infeasibility of manually analyzing very large volumes of comments by administrators ) .",
    "furthermore , the tagging of hasspamhint is performed at the comment - level and not at the _ user - level_____.    the proposed approach consists of first retrieving comments marked with hasspamhint for a given video .",
    "we then extract userids behind the spam comments .",
    "youtube apis provide functions to retrieve the recent commenting activity ( a log of comments and the associated metadata ) of a given user .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : architecture ] , we extract several comment attributes from the discussion - forum usage - log : text of the comment , timestamp , videoid of video commented - on and the value of the binary variable hasspamhint .",
    "the next step consists of computing the values of variables indicating the spam intention of user ( as spammer ) .",
    "we define four indicators and describe our intuition ( and design justification ) behind the proposed indicators .",
    "the value of the following four indicators ( heuristics ) is then used to score a give user as comment spammer .",
    "average time difference between comments ( atdc ) : we extract all the recent comments ( the number of comments that can retrieved is limited by youtube api ) by a user and compute the time differences between all the comments ( comparing each comment with every other comment in the log ) .",
    "we compute the average time difference and record the value .",
    "we hypothesize that a low value of atdc signals spam .",
    "our conjuncture is based on the observation that spammers often employ automated scripts or spam robots for posting comment as a result of which the time difference between subsequent comments is so low that it is not manually feasible .",
    "we confirm the presence of the phenomenon ( in the evaluation dataset and also based on our manual inspection of several youtube forums ) wherein the time interval between sequences of comment is less than few seconds .",
    "percentage of comments with hasspamhint flag ( pchf ) : we compute the percentage of comments marked as hasspamhint .",
    "we hypothesize that a significant percentage of comments by a user marked as hasspamhint can be used as a signal for classifying the user as spammer .",
    "we confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon in youtube user comment logs .",
    "we notice several users who are spammers ( validated based on manual inspection ) exhibit a high pchf value .",
    "comment repeatability across videos ( crav ) : we observe a phenomenon ( which is exploited as an attribute and heuristic for spammer categorization task ) wherein a user posts exactly same comment across discussion forum accompanying several different videos .",
    "a visual inspection of this phenomenon clearly shows that users posting same message across several videos is a case of content promotion and is a reliable comment activity marker for identifying spammers .",
    "a high variability in terms of videoids and a high similarity of comments posted by a user is employed as an indicator in the proposed solution .",
    "comment repetition and redundancy ( crr ) : we observe the presence of a pattern wherein a user simply repeats and posts the same message on the same video ( sometimes within a small time interval and sometimes reasonable spread across the time dimension but still the same message ) . we hypothesize that a high value of crr signals spam .",
    "we compare the text of every comment with the text of all other comments in the log of recent comments posted by a user ( 1 for an exact match and 0 for a non - match ) and compute the average crr value .",
    "we extract comment activity log of 240 unique users consisting of 13000 comments from some of the top rated and most viewed videos on youtube .",

    "figure [ fig : spam ] reveals that there are several users with more than 20 comments having more than 50% of the comments tagged with hasspamhint flag .",
    "we observe several users with more than 60 comments and more than 70% of them were marked as hasspamhint .",
    "figure [ fig : percspam ] provides a different perspective that plots each user on the attribute of percentage spam and crr ( comment repetition and redundancy ) .",
    "figure [ fig : percspam ] clearly shows that users a , b , c and d have posted more than 30 comments ( a 35 , b 118 , c 36 and d 30 ) , have a crr value of more than 0.7 ( which means posting same comment multiple times ) and have 80% of the comments marked as spam by the moderator .",
    "users on top right corner of figures [ fig : spam ] and [ fig : percspam ] are potential spammers .",
