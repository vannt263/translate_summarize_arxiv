    "0.4 cm     cyg x-3 is an binary system possessing a number of unique and puzzling characteristics .",
    "it is the brightest radio source among x - ray binaries @xcite , showing extremely strong radio outbursts and resolved jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is the only x - ray binary that is certainly powered by accretion for which high - energy @xmath1-ray emission has been detected at a high statistical significance @xcite .",
    "it is the only known binary in the galaxy containing both a compact object and a wolf - rayet star @xcite .",
    "its orbital period of @xmath2 d is unusually short for a high - mass binary , which indicates a past spiral - in episode during a common - envelope evolutionary stage . given the value of @xmath3 and estimates of the masses and mass - loss rate , the compact object orbits within the donor photosphere .    in spite of its discovery as early as in 1966 @xcite ,",
    "the nature of its compact object remains uncertain , due to the lack of fully reliable determination of the mass functions and inclination .",
    "based on the currently available information , @xcite found the range of the compact - object mass of @xmath4 , allowing either a neutron star ( ns ) or a low - mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the nature of the compact object is of significant interest , in particular because cyg x-3 is a certain progenitor of a double compact system , after its wolf - rayet star explodes as a supernova @xcite .",
    "the presence of a bh over an ns is favoured by considering the x - ray and radio emission ( @xcite , hereafter szm08 ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the differences between the shape of the x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 in its hard spectral state from those of confirmed bh binaries could be accounted for by compton scattering in the strong stellar wind from the donor .",
    "that model also could account for the lack of high frequencies @xcite in the power spectra of cyg x-3 .",
    "the distance to cyg x-3 has been estimated as @xmath59 kpc @xcite : at this @xmath6 , its observed ( i.e. , not corrected for intrinsic absorption ) bolometric x - ray luminosity is @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "its x - ray spectra have been classified into six states by @xcite , based on _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) pointed observations . here , we adopt a simpler classification into three states , hard , intermediate and soft , based on the relationship between the 35 kev and 1450 kev fluxes . an unresolved issue is the value of the absorbing column within the stellar wind of the donor .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the hard - state spectral data from _ integral _ can be fitted with either a high or low absorbing column .",
    "the two resulting models then significantly differ in both the spectral slope of the soft x - rays and in the bolometric flux . in the former and latter models ,",
    "the intrinsic spectrum is soft , with the photon index of @xmath9 , and hard , with @xmath10 ( defined by the photon spectrum , @xmath11 ) .",
    "only the latter behaviour corresponds to the standard definition of the hard state , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "correlated radio x - ray behaviour of cyg x-3 was discovered in the soft ( 16 kev ) and hard ( 20100 kev ) x - rays by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the correlations were then studied by @xcite , @xcite and szm08 .",
    "curiously , the soft x - rays are positively correlated with the radio flux in the hard state whereas the hard x - rays are anticorrelated .",
    "this differs , e.g. , from another accreting high - mass binary , cyg x-1 , in which both the soft and hard x - rays are positively correlated with the radio emission in the hard state ( @xcite ; hereafter zspl11 ) .",
    "this raises the issue of how the bolometric flux ( dominated by the x - rays , emitted most likely by the accretion flow ) is correlated with the radio emission , originating in the jets of this system .",
    "theoretically , a positive correlation is expected @xcite in a steady accretion - flow  jet system .",
    "generally , this is because both the accretion luminosity and the jet power should be positively correlated with the accretion rate , and the radio flux is positively correlated with the jet power @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study in detail the relationship between the radio emission and x - rays .",
    "in particular , we estimate the bolometric flux of the system , its relation to the radio flux , and the radio spectra .",
    "we then consider implications of our findings for the nature of this accreting source , and compare cyg x-3 to other x - ray binaries .",
    "we study here radio monitoring data at 15 ghz from the ryle telescope , which cover mjd 4923153905 , and the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) , mjd 5461257211 .",
    "the combined data set contains 76776 measurements .",
    "the ami large array is the re - built and reconfigured ryle telescope .",
    "@xcite describe the normal operating mode for the ryle telescope in the monitoring observations ; the observing scheme for the ami large array is very similar .",
    "the new correlator has a useful bandwidth of about 4 ghz ( compared with 0.35 ghz for the ryle ) , but the effective centre frequency is similar .",
    "the data are subject to variations in the flux calibration of @xmath12 per cent from one day to another ; we hereafter assume a 10 per cent fractional error . also , we use the 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz monitoring data @xcite from the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) .",
    "the data are for mjd 5040951823 and contain 11022 measurements .",
    "we average all of the data used here over 1 day ( except for the batse , see below ) .",
    "we have found that 1 day is a time scale which both strongly reduces the measurement errors and averages over the orbital modulation ( with the orbital period of 1/5 d ) , see also @xcite . at the same time , it retains most of the correlated radio and x - ray variability .    for soft and medium x - rays , we use daily - averaged monitoring data from the all - sky monitor ( asm ; @xcite ) on board",

    "the data are given as photon fluxes in three channels , 24 , 410 and 1020kev .",

    "we convert the maxi data to the energy fluxes using the above . for other data sets used here",
    ", we use the above form of the crab spectrum except for taking into account a break to @xmath19 at @xmath20 kev .    for hard x - rays , we use daily - averaged data from the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) survey data .",
    "they were retrieved from the heasarc public archive and processed using the bat_imager software @xcite .",
    "they form a 14195 kev 8-channel count - rate light curve , similar to that used in @xcite , but covering now a substantially longer interval of mjd 5334857279 .",
    "the energy fluxes for the asm and bat data have been obtained by using scaling to the crab spectrum as given above .",
    "we note that @xcite have estimated that , if the photon index of the actual source differs from the crab index by 1 or the column density is up to 10 times larger , the asm energy - range flux differs by at most 30 per cent",
    ". we thus expect similarly minor effects on the scaling of the maxi and bat data .",

    "[ rx4 ] , the slope of the radio / x - ray correlation changes with the energy , becoming increasingly steep with increasing energy up to @xmath010 kev , and then changing its sign to negative in the 1450 and 2075 kev bands . the vertical dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ rx4](d , h ) show the lowest flux in those bands corresponding to the hard state .",
    "the change of the sign does happen between the asm and bat energy ranges , as we have checked by looking at the 1420 kev band , which already shows a negative correlation ( though with more scatter ) .",
    "since that dependence is similar to those in the 1450 and 2075 kev bands , we do not show it here .",

    "( for the asm / bat data , we have neglected here a minor contribution from the 12.214 kev band , not covered by either asm or bat . )",
    "we see that there is hardly any correlation , with the data just forming a long vertical strip .",
    "obviously , there is substantial absorption in cyg x-3 , which needs to be taken into account .",
    "its amount is , however , rather uncertain .",
    "@xcite found that their hard - state data , from _ integral _ , can be fitted by either weak absorption , with the resulting intrinsic slope below 10 kev of @xmath10 , or strong one , with @xmath9 .",

    "the correlation index for most bh low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the hard state for the 39 kev x - ray range is @xmath330.8 @xcite .",

    "we have then created average x - ray spectra in the three spectral states , defined as in fig .",

    "the corresponding slope for the maxi / bat data , shown in fig .  [ rx_bol](d ) , is somewhat higher , which appears to be due to the lower boundary of the maxi data being 2 kev compared to about 1.3 kev for the asm data and the steepening of the correlation with the increasing energy up to @xmath010 kev , found here .",
    "in order to get more insight into the nature of the hard state , we consider the radio spectra based on three measurements , at 2.25 , 8.3 and 15 ghz .",

    ", width=219 ]    thus , the hard state in cyg x-3 is characterized by hard radio spectra , similar to the case of bh binaries .",
    "such spectra are emitted by jets with the partially synchrotron self - absorbed emission @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the soft state shows a wide range of @xmath50 , with majority of them with @xmath50 between @xmath60 and 0 . the emission with @xmath61 is likely optically thin synchrotron .",
    "however , the presence of spectra with @xmath62 during the intermediate and soft states , see fig .",
    "[ alpha ] , indicates that synchrotron self - absorption is also taking place in those states .",
    "we have found , based on the asm , maxi , bat and ryle / ami data , that the cyg x-3 radio flux in the hard state is highly variable and completely uncorrelated with the measured bolometric flux , as shown in figs .",
    "[ rx_bol](a , c ) .",
    "however , a positive correlation is recovered when taking into account absorption of soft x - rays provided it is strong enough , as shown in figs .",
    "[ rx_bol](b , d ) .",
    "we have found that an absorber similar to that fitted to the _ rxte _ pointed data in @xcite gives a reasonable slope of the @xmath30-@xmath63 correlation , @xmath64 , similar to those found in the lower branch of the lxmb radio / x - ray correlation @xcite and in cyg x-1 in the hard state @xcite .",
    "however , this index can be reduced due to an effect following from the physics of a continuous jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) coupled with the free - free absorption in the stellar wind .",
    "namely , the height above the binary plane of a jet at which the bulk of partially synchrotron self - absorbed emission at a given @xmath65 emerges increases with the increasing @xmath66 .",
    "this owes to the associated increase of the density of the jet relativistic electrons , which in turn increases the synchrotron self - absorption optical depth within the jet . for the standard model of @xcite and assuming that the radio emission is partially synchrotron self - absorbed ( which leads to @xmath67 ) , the predicted correlation between the height and the flux was derived in @xcite , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 is the index of the power - law electron distribution in the jet , and @xmath71 is the emitted radio flux . as we have shown in section [ radio ] , the radio spectrum of cyg x-3 in the hard state has indeed @xmath67 , and the above formalism approximately applies .",
    "then , at a higher flux , and thus a greater height , the photon path through the wind becomes shorter , and the orbit - averaged optical depth , @xmath72 , for free - free absorption becomes lower .",
    "a further effect is an increase of the temperature of the wind in response to the increased x - ray flux , which also reduces @xmath72 .",
    "the presence of these effects leads to the intrinsic correlation index , @xmath73 , becoming lower than the one observed , @xmath74 where @xmath31 is the observed radio flux ( zspl11 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath42 can be estimated based on the dependence of the depth of an orbital modulation of the radio flux on @xmath65 . in the case of cyg x-1",
    ", @xcite estimated @xmath75 , leading to @xmath76 in that binary .    in the case of cyg x-3 , the orbital modulation of",
    "the hard - state radio emission is very weak , with the full depth of the modulation of 15 ghz emission of @xmath77 per cent ( zdziarski et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this is much weaker than that in the hard state of cyg x-1 , where it is @xmath78 per cent @xcite .",
    "this weakness is most likely due to two effects .",
    "first , the separation between the binary components in cyg x-3 is about an order of magnitude lower than that of cyg x-1 ( given the orbital period of the former is much shorter than of the latter ) .",
    "second , the height along the jet at which a given radio frequency is emitted is most likely higher in cyg x-3 than in cyg x-1 , due to the accretion rate in the former being much higher than in the latter .",
    "therefore , the asymmetry of the paths of 15-ghz photons through the wind between the superior and inferior conjunction in cyg x-3 is much lower than in cyg x-1 .",
    "this is then likely to lead to the value of @xmath72 at 15 ghz being much lower in cyg x-3 than in cyg x-1 , in spite of the wind mass loss rate being about an order of magnitude higher .    given that , we expect the value of @xmath42 in cyg x-3 to be much closer to unity than that in cyg x-1 .",
    "thus , the above effect of the intrinsic correlation index being lower than the observed one is probably minor in cyg x-3 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the value of @xmath49 , which we have estimated correcting for the x - ray absorption , is significantly higher than our value of @xmath531.5 .",
    "the anticorrelation between hard and soft x - rays within the hard state of cyg x-3 is a consequence of the soft spectrum becoming softer when brighter .",
    "this leads to a pivoting in the @xmath531020 kev energy range .",
    "then , a flux increase in soft x - rays corresponds to a decrease in hard x - rays , and vice versa .",
    "this pivoting pattern is seen , e.g. , in fig .  2 of szm08 ,",
    "see their spectra 1 and 2 .",
    "on the other hand , cyg x-1 has only moderate spectral variability in the hard state .",
    "based on the energy dependence of the fractional variability , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "12 in @xcite , the hard - state pivot is at @xmath0100 kev .",
    "consequently , there is no observed anticorrelation between the soft and hard x - rays in the hard state , as found by zspl11 .    as calculated in @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray variability patterns in the hard state are well explained by originating from thermal comptonization .",
    "if the dominant driver of the variability is in a changing flux of seed photons , the spectrum softens with the increase of the total flux , leading to a pivoting behaviour .",
    "the lower value of the pivot in cyg x-3 than in cyg x-1 is most likely related to the hard state in the former being in fact intermediate . in cyg x-1 , the transition from the hard to the intermediate state",
    "is indeed characterized by pivoting around @xmath01020 kev , see fig .  13 in @xcite",
    ".    given our results in section [ rx ] and the discussion in section [ intrinsic ] , the absorption in cyg x-3 has to be strong , and the intrinsic soft x - ray spectrum in the hard state has to be rather soft , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the hard state of cyg x-3 corresponds indeed to the intermediate state of bh binaries .",
    "as found by zspl11 ( see their figs .",
    "8a , b ) , the positive correlation between the radio and bolometric x - ray fluxes in cyg x-1 is present in both the hard and intermediate states , and breaks down only in the soft state .",
    "we thus expect a similar situation in cyg x-3 , which can explains the observed correlation even if its spectral state is intermediate .",
    "if the apparent hard state in cyg x-3 is intrinsically intermediate , this can explain the difference in its spectral shape with respect to bh binaries in the hard state without scattering in the stellar wind , invoked by @xcite .",
    "the apparent peak at @xmath010 kev in the hard - state @xmath46 spectrum is then an artefact of strong absorption , and the spectrum at higher energies is due to non - thermal , rather than thermal , comptonization @xcite .",
    "also , the hard state of cyg x-3 appears then to be similar to the hardest spectral state of the bh lmxb grs 1915 + 105 , see , e.g. , fig .  4 in @xcite , where the hardest spectra are similar to the intrinsic hard - state spectra of cyg x-3 shown in figs .",

    "we use the compilations of the data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for galactic bh and weakly - magnetized ns binaries .",
    "those authors used the soft and hard colours defined by the energy flux ratio of the bands 46.4 kev to 34 kev and 9.716 kev to 6.49.7 kev , and the bolometric luminosity in the eddington units .",
    "we have updated the values of the distances and bh masses according to the current best estimates , in particular those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculate the colours and eddington ratios , @xmath79 , for cyg x-3 assuming @xmath80 kpc , @xmath81 @xcite and using the asm - bat absorption - corrected spectra shown in fig .  [ spectra](b ) . here",
    "@xmath82 is the eddington luminosity , calculated for pure he ( @xmath83 ) for cyg x-3 , and for the cosmic composition ( @xmath84 ) for other binaries . to calculate the fluxes within a part of a bin , we assume the spectral shape within a bin to be flat in @xmath46 .",
    "the spectra at @xmath85 kev are most likely dominated by disc blackbody emission , and we thus add a contribution from those energies assuming @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain the bolometric fluxes of 2.3 , 5.5 and @xmath87 erg @xmath15 s@xmath8 in the hard , intermediate and soft state , respectively , which correspond to the bolometric ( isotropic ) luminosities of 1.8 , 4.2 , @xmath88 erg s@xmath8 , and the eddington ratios of 0.18 , 0.42 and @xmath89 , respectively .",

    "as we have shown above , cyg x-3 appears relatively similar spectrally in x - rays to grs 1915 + 105 . in order to them in the radio band",
    ", we use the intense ryle telescope monitoring of grs 1915 + 105 conducted during mjd 4985653898 , and the asm data , during mjd 5008855859 . given the fast variability of that object , we have tested the effect of various averaging methods .",
    "we have finally chosen to average the radio over observation periods containing gaps shorter than 0.2 d , which resulted in the average length of an averaged segment of 0.09 d ( usually one per day ) with @xmath106 d. we then correlated those data with the asm dwell data which were within @xmath107 d from the average time of a given radio segment .",
    "we have corrected the averaged asm data for line - of - sight absorption assuming @xmath108 @xmath15 @xcite and the intrinsic spectra with @xmath109 within each asm bin .",
    "we have further added the contribution from @xmath110 kev in the same way as for cyg x-3 , i.e. , assuming @xmath86 , see above .",
    "we have also considered the available batse data for this object .",
    "we have found that addition of the 20160 kev fluxes to those of the asm was possible only for about 40 per cent of the asm points , and an upper part of the correlation was not covered by the asm+batse points .",
    "the average 20160 kev to 1.312.2 kev flux ratio equals 0.11 .",
    "given that the @xmath27 spectra of grs 1915 + 105 in almost all states are decreasing above several kev @xcite , we estimate the flux contribution from 1220 kev to be similar to that from @xmath111 kev .",
    "we have thus applied an approximate bolometric correction of a factor of 1.2 to the fluxes from the asm .",
    "we show the results by the cyan error bars in fig .",
    "we see grs 1915 + 105 does not show a distinct radio / x - ray correlation . on the other hand , @xcite claimed a strong correlation within the plateau ( steady and hard ) state of grs 1915 + 105 . when using the same time intervals as those given in @xcite as used for their correlation , we have found a rather scattered diagram , with a steep positive slope at high radio fluxes and a negative one at low radio fluxes .",
    "when we used the same criteria as given in that paper , i.e. , the ratio of the count rates in the asm third to second channels of @xmath112 and the total asm rate of 3050 s@xmath8 , we found a similar discrepancy . we have recovered a correlation only after imposing an additional criterion of the radio flux of @xmath113 mjy ( which , however , implies that the x - ray state by itself does not set the radio behaviour , in contrast to cyg x-3 ) .",
    "those points are shown in fig .",
    "[ rbol ] by green crosses .",
    "we do see some correlation , with the slope of @xmath114 , somewhat steeper than @xmath115 given in @xcite .",
    "we see that grs 1915 + 105 occupies a similar range of @xmath79 as cyg x-3 ( as also seen in fig .",
    "[ lcd]b ) , but it is both less radio loud and with a much less clear radio / x - ray correlation . the likely reason for that is the difference in the jet environments .",
    "cyg x-3 is a binary with a high - mass donor , and interaction between its wind and the jet leads to presence of shocks , in particular of recollimation shocks @xcite .",
    "those shocks are likely to efficiently accelerate electrons , leading to enhanced radio emission",
    ". however , no such interaction takes place in grs 1915 + 105 , an lxmb .    on the other hand",
    ", cyg x-1 , which is also a high - mass x - ray binary , has the hard - state radio fluxes , shown by the red triangles in fig .",
    "[ rbol ] , an order of magnitude below those of the gx 3394 correlation .",
    "an explanation for that may be provided by the wind ram pressure around the jet in cyg x-1 being much lower than that in cyg x-3 , owing to both the lower mass - loss rate and the larger separation .",
    "the jet lateral pressure in cyg x-1 may then be always larger than that of the wind , provided the jet power is above some critical value @xcite . then no recollimation shock would form .    furthermore , as discussed in section [ intrinsic ] , the radio flux in cyg x-1 is significantly free - free absorbed in the wind from its donor , see zspl11 and @xcite . in the model of the latter ,",
    "the slope of the intrinsic hard - state correlation in cyg x-1 is close to that of the lower branch of the radio / x - ray correlation , first found for h1743322 @xcite .",
    "however , the correction for the wind absorption in cyg x-1 is relatively uncertain .",
    "more detailed knowledge of the wind structure in cyg x-1 is needed to determine the degree of free - free absorption .",
    "our results point out to the importance of taking into account an estimate of the bolometric flux when correlating x - rays with radio , reinforcing the similar conclusion of zspl11 . due to the pivoting spectral variability in x - rays the hard x - rays are often a very bad predictor of the bolometric flux , and can be either uncorrelated or negatively correlated with it .",
    "this effect appears to be present also in seyfert galaxies , in which a common variability pattern in soft x - rays is the steepening of their soft x - ray spectrum with the increasing flux .",
    "this then leads to a pivot in hard x - rays .",
    "this effect can explain the discrepancy between the result of @xcite , who found the radio and soft x - ray emission of their sample of seyferts to be strongly correlated , and the result of @xcite , who found a lack of such correlation for hard x - rays , using _",
    "swift_/bat data .",
    "the latter authors doubted then the reality of the soft x - ray correlation .",
    "however , this discrepancy can be resolved by a pivoting spectral variability of x - rays . in cyg x-3",
    ", it leads to the 1020 kev flux to be completely uncorrelated with radio , see fig .",
    "[ rx4](g ) , in spite of the correlation in soft x - rays , fig .",
    "[ rx4](e ) , being very strong .",
    "we have studied implications of the presence of the positive and negative correlation with the radio flux for the soft and hard x - ray fluxes , respectively , in the hard spectral state of cyg x-3 .",
    "we have found that the radio flux is then completely uncorrelated with the observed , absorbed , broad - band , 1.3100 kev x - ray flux , which appears to be a good approximation to the absorbed bolometric flux . an intrinsic lack of correlation is unlikely on theoretical grounds , as well as it is unlikely given the presence of the strong narrow x - ray band correlations .    however",
    ", we can recover a clear positive correlation if the absorption by the stellar wind of the donor in cyg x-3 is strong enough .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic soft x - ray spectrum in the hard state is relatively soft , similar to those of intermediate states of bh binaries .",
    "this nature of the apparent hard state of cyg x-3 is also consistent with the luminosity of the hard state being much higher in this object than in the hard state of the high - mass bh binary , cyg x-1 .",
    "we have found the radio spectra in the hard state to be hard on average , with @xmath67 .",
    "such spectra are characteristic to bh x - ray binaries in the hard state .",
    "we have compared cyg x-3 with other x - ray binaries . on the x - ray colour - colour and colour - eddington ratio diagrams , cyg x-3 , after correcting its spectra for absorption and for the bh mass of @xmath116 , appears similar to grs 1915 + 105 , with similar colours and @xmath1171 . on the other hand ,",
    "cyg x-3 , at @xmath118 is also similar on such diagrams to ns z - type binaries .",
    "however , the radio emission of those sources is much weaker than that of cyg x-3 , which is both the most radio - luminous and , in its hard state , the most radio - loud ( i.e. , with the highest ratio of the radio to bolometric luminosities ) source among all known x - ray binaries .",
    "still , its radio loudness is much closer to those of bh binaries than to those of ns ones .",
    "this represents a strong argument for the presence of a bh in cyg x-3 .",
    "we interpret the radio loudness and radio fluxes of cyg x-3 being much higher than those of grs 1915 + 105 as due to an enhancement of the jet emission in the former due to interaction of the jet with the very strong stellar wind from the donor .",
    "we have found ( appendix [ lc ] ) that the flux distributions of the radio emission and soft x - rays can be described by two log - normal functions , one corresponding to the hard state and one to soft state .",
    "this indicates a multiplicative and correlated character of variability of cyg x-3 in both the hard and soft state and in both the accretion flow and the jet .",
    "finally , we have presented ( appendix [ lc ] ) the long - time light curves of cyg x-3 using the available data , and compared them to the occurrences of high - energy @xmath1-ray detection .",
    "we have found that a low hard x - ray flux , @xmath119 , is both a necessary and sufficient criterion for detectable @xmath1-rays .",
    "we have found that this criterion has not been satisfied since mjd 55650 ( 2011 march 30 ) until now , mjd 57333 .",

    "the values of the mean and standard deviation for the hard / intermediate - state and soft - state log - normal distributions for the 15 ghz , asm and maxi data are @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , respectively ( in @xmath124 units ) .",
    "we see that the width of the flux distribution in each of the state in the asm data is twice as large as that of the maxi data .",
    "this is due to the maxi 10 - 20 kev channel containing the pivot of the spectral variability , see fig .",
    "[ rx4](g ) , which reduces the range of the flux variability . on the other hand ,",
    "the asm 512.2 kev channel is still below the pivot , see fig .",
    "[ rx4](c ) .",
    "all of the asm and maxi distributions are narrower than the corresponding 15-ghz ones , especially in the soft state .",
    "this reflects the dramatic variability of the radio emission observed in that state .",
    "the presence of a log - normal distribution shows that the underlying physical process has to be multiplicative , with variations coupled together on all time scales @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find the log - normal variability to be present in the both main states of cyg x-3 , hard and soft . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite have found it in the hard state of cyg x-1 on @xmath00.110 s ( for soft x - rays ) and @xmath125 d ( for soft x - rays and radio ) time scales , respectively .",
    "however , it appears that a log - normal flux distribution has not been found before in the soft state of an x - ray binary .",
    "[ lc901 ] shows the light curves .",
    "since the variability in all energy bands spans a large ratio and it is log - normal for some detectors , we normalize each light curve to its geometric unweighted average over the respective observation time span , i.e. , we calculate @xmath126 . for that",
    ", we have to select only points with the measured fluxes of @xmath127 .",
    "this will lead to a certain overestimate of the overall average , but the effect is minor for the light curves presented below . for notational simplicity , we denote @xmath128 . also ,",
    "in order to reduce a contribution from the measurements of poor quality , we include only data with the fractional error of @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the flux error .",
    "we show the 1-d average rates except for the batse , where we show the 3-d average . in the case of bat ,",
    "we use the public 1550 kev data @xcite .",
    "that light curve is very similar to our 1450 kev one . for the maxi",
    ", we show the 210 kev light curve instead of the full 220 kev one in order to have as much correspondence as possible to the asm 1.312.2 kev light curve .",
    "the average rates and standard deviations are given in table a1 .",
    "the standard deviations correspond to the excess variance , i.e. , the variance due to the measurement errors is subtracted , @xmath131 .",
    "\\label{sigma}\\ ] ] the lower value of @xmath132 for the batse data than that for the bat is probably due to the former data being averaged over 3-d rather than 1-d intervals .",
    "the large values of @xmath132 for all the radio data is the consequence of the dramatic radio variability in this object , showing both very bright flares and very weak states , see fig .",
    "[ lc901 ] . for the 15 ghz data",
    ", we have used the estimate of @xmath133 ( section [ data ] ) . for clarity",
    ", we do not show the gbi light curves , which are relatively similar to the ryle / ami one .",
    "we also mark the intervals corresponding to the detected high - energy @xmath1-ray emission in fig .",
    "[ lc901 ] .",
    "these are mjd 5456654647 , 5482154850 , 5532455326 @xcite , 5475054820 , 5499055045 @xcite , 5534355345 @xcite , 5558655610 , 55642 - 55644 @xcite and mjd 5739857412 @xcite .",
    "all those periods correspond to the soft state as defined in our paper , and , with exception for the last occurence , to periods with both the lowest 1550 kev flux detected , with @xmath134 , and occurrences of radio flares , with the 1-d averaged 15 ghz flux of @xmath135 ( as noted , e.g. , by @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the former of these conditions , i.e. , a low hard x - ray flux , appears to be both necessary and sufficient .",
    "we note that this condition has not been satisfied during mjd 5565057397 , see fig .",
