    "whether hadrons survive even in the deconfined quark - gluon plasma is one of the key questions in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this problem was first examined in @xcite and @xcite in different contexts .",
    "the fate of the heavy mesons such as @xmath3 in the deconfined plasma was also investigated in a phenomenological potential picture taking into account the debye screening @xcite . in general , there is no a priori reason to believe that dissociation of the bound states should take place exactly at the phase transition point @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , the spectral function ( spf ) at finite temperature @xmath0 , which has all the information of in - medium hadron properties , is a key quantity to be studied .",
    "recently , the present authors have shown @xcite that the first - principle lattice qcd simulation of spfs is possible by utilizing the maximum entropy method ( mem ) .",
    "we have also formulated the basic concepts and applications of mem on the lattice at @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xcite . to draw the conclusion with a firm ground , in the following we put special emphases on [ i ] the mem error analysis of the resultant spfs and [ ii ] the sensitivity of the spfs to @xmath11 ( the number of temporal data points adopted in mem ) .",
    "these tests are crucial to prevent fake generation and/or smearing of the peaks and must be always carried out as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the applications of mem to @xmath10 system have been known to be a big challenge @xcite .",
    "the difficulty originates from the fact that the temporal lattice size @xmath12 is restricted as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the temporal lattice spacing ( number of temporal lattice sites ) . because of this",
    ", it becomes more difficult to keep enough @xmath11 to obtain reliable spfs as @xmath0 increases .",
    "thus , simulations up to a few times @xmath8 with @xmath16 as large as 30 @xcite inevitably require an anisotropic lattice .    on the basis of the above observation , we have carried out quenched simulations with @xmath17 on @xmath18 anisotropic lattice with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the renormalized anisotropy is @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the spatial lattice spacing .",
    "we take the naive plaquette gauge action and the standard wilson quark action .",
    "corresponding bare anisotropy @xmath23 is determined from the data given in @xcite .",
    "the fermion anisotropy @xmath24 with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) being the the spatial ( temporal ) hopping parameter is determined by comparing the temporal and spatial effective masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons on a @xmath27 lattice .",
    "@xmath28 fm is determined from the @xmath29 meson mass in the chiral limit .",
    "the masses determined on @xmath9 ( @xmath27 ) lattice are @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 gev . if the temporal distance between the source and the sink is closer than @xmath32 , lattice artifact due to anisotropy would appear in the spfs for @xmath33 . to avoid this",
    ", we exclude the six points near the edge ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and adopt the points @xmath36 and @xmath37 until we reach the total number of points @xmath38 .",
    "shown in fig.[p - np ] are @xmath39s for @xmath4 and @xmath40 for @xmath3 . ] for @xmath3 at @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( fig.[p - np](a ) ) and those at @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( fig.[p - np](b ) ) ( corresponding @xmath11 used in these figures are @xmath45 and @xmath46 from low @xmath0 to high @xmath0 ) .",
    "if the deconfined plasma were composed of almost free quarks and gluons , spfs would show a smooth structure with no pronounced peaks above the @xmath47 threshold . to the contrary",
    ", we find a sharp peak near the zero temperature mass even up to @xmath48 as shown in fig.[p - np](a ) , while the peak disappears at @xmath49 as shown in fig.[p - np](b ) .",
    "the width of the first peak in fig.[p - np](a ) partly reflects the unphysical broadening due to the statistics of the lattice data and partly reflects possible physical broadening at finite @xmath0 . at the moment",
    ", the former width of a few hundred mev seems to dominate and we are not able to draw definite conclusions on the thermal mass shift and broadening .",
    "let us now evaluate the reliability of the existence ( absence ) of the sharp peak at @xmath50 by the two tests [ i ] and [ ii ] mentioned before . first test is the error analysis of the peak . shown in fig.[error ]",
    "are the spfs for @xmath3 at @xmath51 and 1.87 with mem error bars ( the frequency interval over which the spf is averaged is characterized by the horizontal position and extension of the bars , while the mean value and the 1@xmath52 uncertainty of the integrated strength within the interval are characterized by the heights of the bars ) .",
    "the sharp peak at @xmath53 is statistically significant , and the absence of the peak at the same position at @xmath54 is also statistically significant .",
    "the features found for @xmath3 in figs . [ p - np ] and [ error ] are also observed for @xmath4 .",
    "the second test is the @xmath11 dependence of the spfs . shown in fig.[n - dep](a ) is the comparison of spf obtained with @xmath55 and that of @xmath56 for the same temperature @xmath53 @xmath57 .",
    "the two curves are almost identical with each other .",
    "fig.[n - dep](b ) shows spfs obtained with @xmath58 and 33 for higher temperature @xmath54 @xmath59 .",
    "again the two curves are almost identical .",
    "therefore , the qualitative change of the spf between @xmath60 and 1.87@xmath8 is the real thermal effect and not caused by the artifact of the insufficient number of data points .    to conclude , we have studied the spectral functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the deconfined plasma using lattice monte carlo data and the maximum entropy method .",
    "the number of temporal sites @xmath15 is taken as large as 46 and 40 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "careful analyses of the mem errors and the @xmath11 dependence of the results are carried out .",
    "it is found that there are distinct resonances up to @xmath63 and they disappear between 1.6@xmath8 and @xmath7 .    * acknowledgement * m.a .",
