    "every closed orientable 3-dimensional manifold @xmath2 admits a _",
    "heegaard splitting _ ,",
    "i.e. a decomposition into two handlebodies @xmath3 and @xmath4 which meet along their boundary .",
    "this common boundary is called a _ heegaard surface _ in @xmath2 and is usually considered only up to isotopy in @xmath2 .",
    "heegaard splittings are a convenient way to define a @xmath0-manifold , but a priori it is difficult to get structural information about the manifold from them . in the last fifteen years a lot of progress was made in understanding the structural aspects of heegaard splittings .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved in the work of casson and gordon [ cg ] which ties heegaard splittings to the existence of incompressible surfaces . in particular , for non - haken 3-manifolds strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces are now considered as suitable analogues of essential surfaces in the haken case , thus establishing them as an important tool in the study of these manifolds .",
    "the main difficulty with heegaard splittings is that a heegaard splitting corresponds to a double coset @xmath5 of an element @xmath6 in the mapping class group @xmath7 of a closed surface @xmath8 of genus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the subgroup of surface homeomorphisms which extend to a handlebody @xmath11 via a properly chosen identifiction @xmath12 .",
    "this subgroup is not normal in @xmath7 , and it is not well understood at all .",
    "the geometric analogue of this problem is the absence of a canonical coordinate system \" , that is a preferred choice of disks which define the handle structure in each of the two handlebodies of the splitting .",
    "it is this problem that we wish to address .",
    "we choose a _ complete decomposing system _ @xmath13 , of @xmath1 , @xmath9 , disjoint non - parallel essential disks for each of the two handlebodies .",
    "these systems @xmath14 and @xmath15 decompose each of the handlebodies into @xmath16 solid pairs of pants .",
    "thus we obtain a _ heegaard diagram _ for @xmath2 , i.e. a finite set of combinatorial data which determine @xmath2 .",
    "there are infinitely many such distinct complete decomposing systems in each handlebody , so that the idea to recover characteristic data for @xmath2 from a heegaard diagram might seem hopeless .",
    "it is in this light that the following main result of this paper should be seen :    * theorem [ mainthm ] . * _ for any closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 and any heegaard splitting @xmath17 there are only finitely many pairs of complete decomposing systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 which satisfy the double rectangle condition .",
    "_    the double rectangle condition , defined precisely in section [ doreco ] below , is a slight strengthening of the rectangle condition introduced by casson and gordon in [ cg ] .",
    "the statement that casson - gordon s rectangle condition is generic , can be given a precise meaning using thurston s measure on the boundary of teichmller space .",
    "the question , whether the existence of complete decomposing systems which satisfy the double rectangle condition is a generic property for heegaard splittings , is at present open ( see remark [ yettobewritten ] ) .    as a corollary",
    "we obtain :    [ fmc ] let @xmath2 be an atoroidal closed @xmath0-manifold which admits a heegaard splitting with two complete decomposing systems that satisfy the double rectangle condition .",
    "then the mapping class group of @xmath2 is finite .",
    "it follows from a result of jaco and rubinstein [ jr ] that an atoroidal @xmath0-manifold has only finitely many heegaard splittings of any given genus .",
    "any self - homeomorphism of @xmath2 must take two complete decomposing systems @xmath20 that satisfy the double rectangle condition to two other such systems . and , by theorem [ mainthm ] , there are only finitely many of those . but every mapping class which fixes @xmath21 and @xmath22 is easily seen to be trivial .      in section [ doreco ]",
    "we define the basic terminology and state our main result .",
    "we give a counterexample to the conclusion of theorem [ mainthm ] if the double rectangle condition `` is replaced by the weaker casson - gordon rectangle condition '' .",
    "this shows that the rectangle condition is not sufficient to characterize a finite collection of preferred \" decomposing disk systems .    in section [ disktypes ]",
    "we investigate how the disks of a second complete decomposing system @xmath23 in @xmath3 intersect the complementary components @xmath24 of the fixed decomposing system @xmath25 in @xmath3 ( these are solid pairs of pants ) .",
    "any connected component @xmath26 of this intersection is a disk which has as boundary an alternating sequence of arcs from @xmath27 and from @xmath28 .",
    "the number of such arcs can be used as a measure of complexity for @xmath29 .",
    "a priory there is no bound on this complexity , which is one of the main reasons why homeomorphisms of 3-dimensional handlebodies remain a mysterious and little understood topic . in our context , however , one can exploit the rectangle condition to get an upper bound on this complexity which depends on @xmath25 and @xmath30 only .",
    "even better , we show in section [ disktypes ] that , up to proper isotopy , the disk @xmath29 must come from a finite collection which depends again only on @xmath25 and @xmath30 .    in section [ thickandthin ]",
    "we investigate the complementary components of @xmath23 in each solid pair @xmath24 .",
    "they are called _ parts _ , and we distinguish _ thin _ and _ thick _ parts . in the presence of the rectangle condition the possible nature and number of thick parts are both determined by @xmath25 and @xmath30 , while the number of thin parts depends in an essential way also on @xmath23 .    bounding",
    "the number of the thin parts is the main problem in the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] and is the only place where the double rectangle condition is used .",
    "this is accomplished in section 5 .",
    "[ similar ] the intersection pattern induced by the disks from @xmath23 on every solid pair of pants @xmath24 is strongly reminiscent of the intersection pattern on a @xmath0-simplex given by a surface @xmath31 in normal position , which is cut by @xmath31 into a bounded number of _ thick _ blocks and an arbitrary number of _ thin _ pieces that occur in parallel stacks \" ( compare e.g. [ sch ] ) .",
    "one important difference is that normal surface theory is done for closed surfaces , while we work with disks in handlebodies .",
    "* acknowledgments : * we would like to thank hyam rubinstein for pointing out corollary [ fmc ] to us , and saul schleimer for many inspiring discussions .",
    "we also thank the universit daix - marseille iii and the technion , where most of this work was done .",
    "finally , special thanks go to caf parisien in marseille for its hospitality .",
    "let @xmath2 be a closed @xmath0-dimensional manifold , and let @xmath32 be a closed orientable _ heegaard surface _ of genus @xmath9 cutting @xmath2 into two handlebodies @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be two complete decomposing disk systems , i.e. each handlebody is decomposed by the disk system into a union of solid pairs of pants .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath35 and @xmath36 have only essential intersections , that is , they intersect in transverse intersection points , and one can not decrease their number by a proper isotopy of @xmath25 in @xmath3 or of @xmath30 in @xmath4 .",
    "a _ wave _ @xmath37 with respect to @xmath38 is an arc that meets @xmath25 only in its boundary points @xmath39 , which lie on the same component @xmath40 , such that in @xmath3 the arc @xmath41 is isotopic relative endpoints to a subarc of @xmath42 , but not in @xmath43 .",
    "similarly we define waves for @xmath44 .",
    "we say that the closure of a connected component of @xmath45 is a _ rectangle _ @xmath46 if it is homeomorphic to a disk , whose boundary @xmath47 is a concatenation of precisely four arcs , two of which are subarcs on curves in @xmath35 and the other two are subarcs of curves in @xmath36 .",
    "it is possible that two of the curves from one system belong to the same component , and even that two opposite boundary vertices \" of the rectangle are itentified .",
    "an _ adjacent pair of curves _ in @xmath35 ( similarly in @xmath30 ) consists of two curves which can be joined by an essential arc in @xmath48 which does not meet other curves from @xmath35 , and which is not a wave .",
    "such an arc lies in one of the pair of pants of the decomposition defined by @xmath35 , and is unique up to isotopy in this pair of pants , so that we usually suppress its mentioning and only note the two curves in @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , an _ adjacent triple of curves _ in @xmath35 consist of three curves which can be connected by an arc that intersects the middle curve transversely , and the resulting two subarcs define two adjacent pairs of curves .",
    "note that the above two definitions include the situation where the inclusion of the pair of pants into the surface @xmath43 identifies two of its boundary curves .",
    "the same definitions hold for @xmath15 .",
    "a. casson and c. gordon have introduced the following [ cg ] :    [ rectangle condition ] the complete decomposing systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfy the _ rectangle condition _ if every pair of adjacent curves in @xmath35 and any pair of adjacent curves in @xmath36 form at least one rectangle which is contained in the intersection of the respective pairs of pants .",
    "the importance of this notion comes from casson - gordon s observation that a heegaard splitting @xmath49 which satisfies the rectangle condition is strongly irreducible : indeed , any essential disk @xmath50 must either be parallel to a curve of @xmath25 or contain a wave with respect to @xmath51 . in both cases there",
    "exist two adjacent curves of @xmath25 such that @xmath52 intersects all rectangles formed by these two curves with any adjacent pair of curves from @xmath36 .",
    "as the analogue is true for any essential disk @xmath53 , it follows from the rectangle condition that @xmath52 and @xmath54 must intersect in one of the rectangles , so that the heegaard splitting is strongly irreducible . in particular",
    "all waves with respect to @xmath25 must intersect all waves with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "the same idea is used in the proof of the next lemma .",
    "[ nowaves ] ( a ) if @xmath25 and @xmath30 satisfy the rectangle condition , then for any disk @xmath50 the boundary curve @xmath55 does not contain a wave with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "\\(b ) every wave on @xmath43 with respect to @xmath21 intersects every curve which bounds a disk in @xmath4 at least once .",
    "\\(a ) as @xmath25 is a complete decomposing system of @xmath3 , the curve @xmath56 must either be parallel to one of the @xmath57 , or it contains a wave with respect to @xmath35 . in both cases there",

    "if @xmath56 also contains a wave with respect to @xmath36 , then there exist two adjacent curves of @xmath30 with the same property .",
    "hence we could deduce from the rectangle condition at least one self - intersection of @xmath56 in one of the rectangles .",
    "\\(b ) the claim follows exactly from the same arguments .",
    "[ nonfinite]it is possible that a given heegaard splitting possesses infinitely many non - isotopic decomposing disk systems @xmath21 and @xmath58 all satisfying the rectangle condition .",
    "an example will be given at the end of this section .",
    "to get the desired finiteness result theorem [ mainthm ] , we have to strengthen the rectangle condition slightly : we call the union of two rectangles which have a side in common , a _",
    "double rectangle_. thus the boundary of a double rectangle formed by @xmath21 and @xmath44 consists of two subarcs from an adjacent pair of curves of , say , @xmath59 , and of two subarcs from the two outer curves of an adjacent triple of curves of @xmath60 .    [ drc ] the decomposing disk systems @xmath21 and @xmath58 satisfy the _",

    "otherwise , the curve @xmath56 has a wave with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that there is at least one adjacent pair of curves in some pair of pants in @xmath61 which is separated by this wave . since @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfies the double rectangle condition , the adjacent pair and hence the curve @xmath56 must intersect any adjacent triple of curves from @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that on an adjacent pair of pants we have the following intersection pattern as in fig . 1 .",
    "figure 1 .",
    "we can now state the main result of this paper :    [ mainthm ] for any closed orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 and any heegaard splitting @xmath49 there are only finitely many pairs of complete decomposing systems @xmath18 and @xmath19 which satisfy the double rectangle condition .",
    "we finish this section with a counterexample to the analogue of this result , if one replaces the double rectangle condition by the simple rectangle condition :    [ example1 ] consider the genus two heegaard diagram obtained from fig .",

    "note that our choice of the dehn twist exponent ensures that the two systems @xmath71 and @xmath73 satisfy the rectangle condition .",
    "now consider the annulus @xmath74 as in fig . 2 and change the system @xmath75 to a system @xmath76 by twisting @xmath77 times along @xmath78 .",
    "it is immediate to see that all systems @xmath76 together with the system @xmath73 satisfy the rectangle condition for all @xmath79 .",
    "we now concentrate on the handlebody @xmath3 which contains two complete decomposing disk systems @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "we think of @xmath25 as being the fixed reference system , and of @xmath23 as an alternative candidate : the goal of the paper is to show that , under the right conditions , there are only finitely many such @xmath23 .    in order to simplify the terminology we define :    [ uniformly ] we say that a constant defined by means of @xmath23 is _ uniformly bounded _ if it depends only on the fixed pair of decomposing systems of disks @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    as handlebodies",
    "are irreducible , we can assume that ( after a suitable isotopy ) @xmath25 and @xmath23 are _ tight _ : they intersect only in arcs which terminate in essential intersection points of their boundary curves .",
    "thus each disk of @xmath23 is cut by @xmath25 into _ disk pieces _ which have as boundary an alternating sequence of _ intersection arcs _ from @xmath80 and _ connecting arcs _ from @xmath81 .    every connecting arc is contained in a single pair of pants from the decomposition of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath25 , and it can not be boundary parallel on this pair of pants : this follows from our assumption that @xmath25 and @xmath23 are tight . for intersection arcs we prove the weaker fact that they can not be boundary parallel on @xmath83 :    [ lemma2 ] let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be complete decomposing systems , and assume that the pair @xmath86 satisfies the rectangle condition",
    ". then for any disk @xmath87 every intersection arc @xmath88 has its endpoints in two distinct connected components of @xmath89 .",

    "we now use the disks from @xmath30 to group the intersection and the connecting arcs , defined above , into equivalence classes : given a disk @xmath98 , two intersection arcs @xmath99 will be called _ parallel _ if the pair @xmath100 is isotopic to the pair @xmath101 in @xmath102 .",

    "hence its isotopy class relative endpoints is essentially determined by the choice of the boundary curves from @xmath113 which contain the endpoints of @xmath90 .",
    "more precisely , up to relative isotopy these arcs are determined by the intervals on such a boundary curve which in turn are determined by the intersections with the system @xmath30 , up to possible twists around these boundary curves .",
