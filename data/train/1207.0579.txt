    "recent cosmological observations  @xcite have demonstrated that our universe is undergoing the phase of an accelerating expansion .",
    "although general relativity ( gr ) developed in the last century has been successful in many ways of explaining various experimental results in gravity , the nature of the accelerating universe now rises as a small cloud shrouding it .",
    "we thereby look for a more general theory that comprises gr yet able to solve the accelerating problem referred to as dark energy  @xcite . by virtue of the local gauge principle ,",
    "one leads to incorporate poincar group as gauge group of a principal bundle , such that the local lorentz symmetry of the spacetime is preserved  @xcite .",
    "an attempt is to release torsion from a connection , rather than the levi - civita connection in the standard gr , which also acts as a dynamical field like metric tensor .",
    "such spacetime is usually called riemann - cartan manifold . the gauge theory based on this manifold ,",
    "is known as poincar gauge theory ( pgt )  @xcite",
    ".    it has been investigated in  @xcite that there are six modes by the decomposition of the connection according to torsion tensor in the linearlized theory , classified as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in terms of spins and parities . among them , the @xmath5 mode  @xcite , also called the _ scalar - torsion _ mode , does not directly interact with any known fundamental source  @xcite .",
    "along with the property induced by the nonlinear equation set , this @xmath5 mode is our main concern . in  @xcite ,",
    "shie , nester and yo ( sny ) have examined models with the spin @xmath5 mode in pgt to achieve the late time accelerating expansion of the universe . in other words , the geometric effect of torsion",
    "is treated as an effective dark energy . in particular , they have presented two cases with the solutions of a constant curvature and positive kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "the first case is an extremely simple solution existing inside the system of differential equations formed by the spin @xmath5 mode , which provides a modeling for the late time de sitter universe for dark energy .",
    "note that this simple solution violates the positivity argument  @xcite .",
    "the second one is referred to as the normal case , which conforms with the regular positivity condition , but it gives rise to no obvious analytic solution .",
    "torsion cosmology related to the scalar - torsion mode has been also explored in  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on these two cases and present numerical solutions of the late - time acceleration behavior corresponding to the equation of state ( eos ) , defined by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy density and pressure of the relevant component of the universe , respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the scalar - torsion of the spin @xmath5 mode in pgt and give equations of motion for cosmology . in sec .",
    "iii , we show our numerical results on the cosmological evolutions for the scalar - torsion mode .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "pgt of gravity starts with a lagrangian 4-form on @xmath9-spacetime : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a set of the orthonormal dual basis , @xmath12 is the connection 1-form with respect to @xmath11 , @xmath13 is the matter lagrangian , and @xmath14 is the gravitational lagrangian that can be made up by certain combinations . in  @xcite , sny studied the spin @xmath5 mode , given by  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hodge dual map , @xmath17 is the volume 4-form of the space - time and @xmath18 with @xmath19 are the irreducible pieces of the torsion 2-form @xmath20 , defined by  @xcite @xmath21 the coefficients of @xmath14 in ( [ e : sny ] ) are constrained by the positivity argument  @xcite such that @xmath22 the independent variation of ( [ e : lagrangian ] ) with respect to @xmath23 yields  @xcite @xmath24 where the gauge field momenta are given by @xmath25 and the source terms are defined by @xmath26 corresponding to the symmetric energy - momentum tensor - valued 4-form , asymmetric vector - valued 3-form usually called canonical energy - momentum tensor , and tensor - valued 3-form known as canonical spin angular momentum tensor , respectively",
    ". one can also write the decompositions into the basis of @xmath27  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the equations of motion are given symbolically as @xmath30      we shall describe our universe with the flrw cosmology , which is homogeneous and isotropic with the metric @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the constant curvature . for simplicity , we shall only consider the flat universe with @xmath33 .    for ( [ e : sny ] ) of the sny model in the frlw cosmology with no spin source @xmath34 ,",
    "the main field equation ( [ e : eom ] ) leads to  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , which is the time component of the torsion trace , defined by @xmath39 . here ,",
    "@xmath40 in ( [ e : main eq1])-([e : main eq3 ] ) denotes the affine curvature with respect to the curvature 2-form @xmath41 , given by @xmath42 hence , one obtains the relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the curvature of the levi - civita connection induced by ( [ e : frw ] ) .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath45 is defined as ( [ e : canonical em tensor ] ) and @xmath46 stands for the trace @xmath47 .",
    "explicitly , one has @xmath48 with the subscript @xmath49 representing the ordinary matter including both dust and radiation .    to see the geometric effect of torsion , we can write down the friedmann equations as @xmath50 with @xmath51 in gr , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the critical energy density and total pressure of the universe , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to the energy density and pressure of some effective field , respectively . by comparing the equation of motion of the scalar - torsion mode in pgt  ( [ e : rho_t ] ) to the friedmann equations  ( [ e : friedmanneq ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath56 which will be regarded as the effective torsion dark energy density and pressure , respectively . from  ( [ e : friedmanneq ] ) , we get the continuity equation , @xmath57 which can also be derived by applying the identity @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the covariant derivative with respect to the levi - civita connection and @xmath60 is the effective energy - momentum tensor of torsion dark energy .    in addition , from ( [ e : main eq1 ] ) - ( [ e : main eq3 ] ) , one can check that the continuity equation for the torsion field is also valid , @xmath61 @xmath62 consequently , we obtain the continuity equation for the ordinary matter to be @xmath63 by assuming no coupling between radiation and dust , the matter densities of radiation ( @xmath0 ) and dust ( @xmath64 ) in scalar - torsion cosmology share the same evolution behaviors as gr , @xmath61 @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . in order to investigate the cosmological evolution ,",
    "it is natural to define the total eos by  @xcite @xmath67 which leads to @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 , representing the energy density ratios and eoss of matter and torsion , respectively .",
    "note that the eos in ( [ e : w_t ] ) , which is commonly used in the literature , e.g.  @xcite , can be examined by cosmological observations in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can be used to distinguish the modified gravity theories from @xmath72cdm  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the evolution of the torsion dark energy can be described in terms of solely @xmath73 by @xmath74 in the following section , we shall focus on this important quantity .",
    "the evolution of torsion cosmology is determined by ( [ e : main eq1 ] ) - ( [ e : main eq3 ] ) . in general",
    ", one needs to solve the dynamics of @xmath40 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 by the system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , one easily sees that in ( [ e : main eq3 ] ) there exists a special case , in which the constant scalar affine curvature @xmath77 is a possible solution  @xcite . recall that in order to conform with the positive kinetic energy argument , the condition ( [ e : condition ] ) is needed .",
    "however , since the special case yields the negative curvature @xmath78 with a negative matter density @xmath79 , the condition of @xmath80 is required  @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we concentrate on the eos of the scalar - torsion mode in both special and normal cases .",
    "we also present the cosmological evolution of the density ratio , defined by @xmath81 , from a high redshift to the current stage .      in this special case",
    ", we take the assumptions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations ( [ e : main eq1 ] ) - ( [ e : main eq3 ] ) reduce to @xmath85    for the numerical calculation , we rescale the parameters as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the matter density at @xmath88 and the scalar affine curvature is a constant @xmath89 . from ( [ eq : sc01 ] ) , ( [ eq : sc02 ] ) and ( [ eq : sc03 ] ) , we obtain the following dimensionless equations , @xmath90 where the prime @xmath91 stands for @xmath92 and @xmath93 . using ( [ e : conservation_rho_t ] ) , ( [ e : w_t ] ) and ( [ eq : scrhot ] ) , we find that @xmath94    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fg:2]a , we show the evolution of the density ratio , @xmath95 , as a function of the redshift @xmath96 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the torsion density @xmath54 dominates the universe in the high redshift regime ( @xmath97 ) with the general parameter and initial condition selection , while the matter - dominated regime is reached only within a very short time interval . in fig .",
    "[ fg:2]b , we show that @xmath73 has an asymptotic behavior at the high redshift regime , @xmath61 @xmath98 . moreover ,",
    "in the low redshift regime , it may even have a phantom crossing behavior , @xmath61 , the torsion eos could cross the phantom divide line of @xmath99 . as a result ,",
    "the scalar - torsion mode is able to account for the late - time accelerating universe . finally , we remark that the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite only indicated an oscillating behavior without the asymptotic one above for the torsion density .",
    "we have studied the torsion eos of the two cases of the scalar - torsion mode in pgt of gravity , which are suitable for explaining the late - time accelerating universe but each of them possesses a quite different cosmological behavior in the high redshift regime . for the first case , which violates the positive kinetic energy and",
    "has a constant affine curvature @xmath40 , the torsion eos has asymptotic behaviors : @xmath100 in the radiation - dominated stage , @xmath101 in the matter - dominated stage , and finally a late - time de - sitter solution corresponding to @xmath99 .",
    "the torsion density ratio of @xmath102 in the high redshift regime is a `` negative '' constant . for the second one , which has the positive kinetic energy , under the general selection of parameters and initial conditions",
    ", the torsion eos still shows an asymptotic behavior , @xmath103 , in the high redshift regime , while it could cross the phantom divide line in the low redshift regime . the most confusing phenomenon in this spin",
    "@xmath5 scalar - torsion cosmology is that the universe is dominated by torsion in the high redshift regime even though there exists a narrow window for the matter - dominated epoch .",
