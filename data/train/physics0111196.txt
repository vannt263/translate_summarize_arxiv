    "<S> lattice effects on the kink families of two models for one - dimensional nonlinear klein - gordon systems with double - well on - site potentials are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expression of the generalized peierls - nabarro pinning potential is obtained and confronted with numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> many physical problems have greatly contributed to the interest on double - well potential(dwp ) models  @xcite . among the most important ones </S>",
    "<S> are the mechanism of protonic conductivity in molecular systems  @xcite , structural instabilities in one - dimensional(1d ) perovskyte - like systems  @xcite as well as hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics @xcite , and peierls transition in 1d conductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first problem ows its interest to the fundamental role of proton migrations among the surrounding(heavy ) ions of the 1d molecular system . </S>",
    "<S> the 1d character of these systems sits in the very high conductivity along the hydrogen - bond(hb)-about @xmath0 times greater - compared to the two other directions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strong anisotropic conductivity relies on structural defects , that is ionic and bonding defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> defects are consequent upon proton hopping and bond distortions across the energy barrier between the two most stretched proton positions along the hb . </S>",
    "<S> when evoking ferroelectricity and the peierls transition(an instability of the electronic structure of a 1d electron - phonon system ) , the most natural framework is that of the landau theory of second - order phase transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the `` dwp '' scheme in this theory is appropriate for such phenomena as the proton ordering transitions in the pseudo-1d ferroelectrics @xmath1  @xcite and structural instabilities in 1d organic and inorganic conductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all these systems , in an idealized context in the absence of external bias(electric or magnetic fields ) , defect nucleations(soliton lattice )  @xcite and the intrinsic discrete structure of the background substrate lattice  @xcite are the two main processes influencing conductivity . in general </S>",
    "<S> they give rise to an activated transport property that consists either in a conducting phase or in an insulating phase  @xcite . in concrete terms , by the kramers theory of diffusion it is easy to point out that the kink diffusion coefficient in a discrete medium will be weighted by an arhenius - like factor @xmath2 which accounts for the escape rate of kink from the lattice trapping . </S>",
    "<S> this factor depends on the vibration frequency @xmath3 of the kink in its attempts to jump across the pinning potential barrier , thereby determining its lifetime in the discrete medium . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the discrete kink diffusion coefficient is of the form @xmath4 @xmath5 in this formula is the lattice - induced trapping potential barrier , the kink pinning frequency @xmath3 is directly connected to this physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the activated diffusion coefficient given above is not only interesting in its own right , but also it furnishes relevant knowledge for capturing the essential features of all other transport parameters namely , the kink mobility and conductivity . + while dwp models have so become useful in the understanding of physical problems , insights gained from the earliest model i.e. the @xmath6 rapidly saturated owing to several shortcomings . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the rigidity prevents from getting further in the theory as to analytically account for the possibility of shifting the potential minima and hump to adjust the model to a desired context . </S>",
    "<S> this has been particularly dramatic for molecular solids which backbones are often so flexible that chemical bonds must continuously relax or contract to avoid bond breakings . </S>",
    "<S> to overcome these shortcomings , the morse and double - morse(dm ) potentials were considered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dm potential has been used in the recent studies of the protonic conductivity  @xcite and the proton ordering transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this last context , it has even been argued  @xcite that the dm model is to date the best candidate giving relatively good account of the so - called `` geometric effect '' . </S>",
    "<S> + in addition to the dm , several other parametrized dwp models are currently present in the literature  @xcite . by their essential virtues </S>",
    "<S> they allow theoretical manipulations at one wish . </S>",
    "<S> the present work deals with two versions among the most general ones . </S>",
    "<S> a main question in the theory of parametrized dwp ( pdwp ) is their analytical tractability . indeed , except the soliton solutions that are often easy to obtain , several other physical quantities are explicitely unaccessible . </S>",
    "<S> even their statistical mechanics are most often proceeded numerically  @xcite , or by transfer integral methods which however can open only very narrow paths in the rather wide range of thermodynamic parameters of the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the present two variants we will discuss the lattice discreteness properties to both analytical and numerical viewpoints . </S>",
    "<S> we start by deriving a generalized analytical expression of the peierls - nabarro potential(pnp )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we carry out a numerical analysis to get into the intimate discrete structure of each model . by this last way we also provide an adequate framework to check the exactness of our analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> + starting , consider a @xmath7 nonlinear klein - gordon system whose dynamics can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath8 \\label{a}\\ ] ] @xmath9 is the pdwp assumed of the form  @xcite : @xmath10 the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 can take different values , namely : @xmath13 for this value set , ( [ b ] ) is a dwp with variable positions of degenerate minima but fixed potential hump . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 for this second value set ( [ b ] ) is a dwp with fixed minima but variable potential hump . in the continuum limit(@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing ) </S>",
    "<S> , the pdwp admits single - kink solutions explicitly given by :    @xmath17 \\label{e}\\ ] ]    where we set @xmath18 and call @xmath19 the kink width : @xmath20 @xmath21 in this last relation is the kink `` bare '' width . at this step </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to remark that according to the two model parameters , only the first will give rise to kink family whose widths effectively vary(decrease ) as function of ( with increasing)@xmath22 , whereas all kinks of the second family have their widths bounded to the constant @xmath21 whatever @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> however , their `` kink shape '' is deeply affected by the deformability parameter as noticed elsewhere  @xcite . + as our primary goal is the kink - lattice interactions , proceeding with we appeal to the pnp approach which assumes the existence of an effective potential field provided by the lattice substrate and via which kinks get pinned due to lattice discreteness . </S>",
    "<S> several techniques are known for this problem . according to the recent  @xcite(the collective - coordinate method ) , </S>",
    "<S> lattice discreteness act on the kink in two different aspects namely on the kink trajectory(time dependence of the kink center - of - mass coordinate within the discrete pnp ) , and shape . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of the kink shape(discreteness effect - induced kink shape dressing ) is though to be manifest of radiations by the pinned kink , of discrete phonons as a shape response to the lattice discrete structure . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> there is yet a sound experimental evidence of such phenomenon , so we will not consider this aspect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we are interested in the kink static configuration which is a suitable approximation of the `` pinned - kink '' configuration so regular in structural transition processes . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are left with the sole problem of calculating the pnp . </S>",
    "<S> we start by writing the total energy of the discrete system considering the static part of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) : @xmath23 the discrete sum in ( [ h ] ) can be evaluated using the poisson sommation formula  @xcite , @xmath24 the integrand in this last equation is derived from the single - kink solution eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e ] ) , which gives : @xmath25 we take only the real part of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ i ] ) which is equivalent to restrict the sum over cosine harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , this is consistent with the fact that @xmath26 is an even function of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the coefficients of this series must be determined by the following class of integrals : @xmath28 ^ 2 } = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2 } } \\frac{\\sinh^{3/2}(x_o)\\gamma(2+iy_m)\\gamma(2-iy_m)}{\\gamma(2 ) } \\wp^{-3/2}_{-1/2+iy_m}[\\coth(x_o ) ] \\label{k}\\ ] ] @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the associate legendre function  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complex - argument gamma function @xmath31 appearing in this set of integrals is defined such that : @xmath32 } } \\label{n}\\ ] ] the product function is evaluated by the standard formula  @xcite : @xmath33 = \\cosh(y_m ) \\label{o}\\ ] ] rewriting ( [ i ] ) as a fourier series in @xmath34 , combinations of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j])-([o ] ) lead to the following expression of the fourier components : @xmath35 \\label{r}\\ ] ] the most indicated framework where to check the consistency of our analytical theory is the numerical treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we performed the integration in ( [ i ] ) following an extended midpoint scheme . </S>",
    "<S> results are displayed on figures 1 and 2 for arbitrary values of the deformability parameter @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the main variable here is the dimensionless kink bare width @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 corresponds to the asymptotic limit @xmath37 , where the two models reduce to the well - known @xmath38 model . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1a and 1b are the kink continuum energies at rest i.e. @xmath39 , while figures 2a and 2b represent the pnp barriers @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> curves are plotted in unit of @xmath41 . though the figures indicate rather complex behaviours of the pnp barrier with respect to @xmath22 , their most stricking feature is the drastic exponential fall - off of the pinning barrier with increasing @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> for the first model , this feature relates to the fact that the greater the deformability parameter the narrower the kink . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the kink width in the second model is independent on @xmath22 but however , one clearly sees that the corresponding pnp barriers show almost the same dependence on @xmath22 as in the first model . </S>",
    "<S> + the drastic fall - off of the pnp barriers can be interpreted in terms of the kinks the overcoming lattice pinning effect . </S>",
    "<S> such a behaviour suggests an enhancement of the conducting regime in the discrete system at relatively narrow kink widths . </S>",
    "<S> this sounds consistent with previous predictions  @xcite within the @xmath38 theory . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , by tuning the deformability parameter(which in the context of 1d molecular systems may correspond to adjust the equilibrium positions of ions , for instance ) , it is expected that the correct order of magnitude of transport parameters of dwp systems will be obtained with relatively best accuracy  @xcite .    </S>",
