    "recently , more and more observations of type ia supernovae suggest that the observable universe is presently undergoing an accelerating expansion,@xmath1 which is contrary to what has always been assumed that the expansion is slowing down due to gravity with a positive decelerating parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this , together with the recent high precision measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations,@xmath3 indicates the existence of dark energy characterized by a negative pressure , contributing with about @xmath4 of the totel energy density of the universe ( the others being essentially dark matter and baryons ) .",
    "the simplest model for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "however , because of the so - called cosmological constant problem,@xmath5 one wishes to have a dynamically decaying @xmath0 or an evolving large - scale scalar field known as quintessence@xmath6 to explain the acceleration of our universe .",
    "it is of great interest that our conventional universe is embedded in a higher - dimensional world as required in the kaluza - klein theories and the brane world theories . in this paper",
    ", we consider a five - dimensional cosmological model presented by liu and wesson.@xmath7 rather than the `` big bang '' singularity of the standard cosmology , this 5d model is characterized by a `` big bounce '' , at which the `` size '' of the universe is finite . before the bounce the universe contracts and after the bounce the universe expands .",
    "this model is 5d ricci - flat , implying that it is empty viewed from 5d .",
    "however , as is known from the induced matter theory,@xmath8 4d einstein equations with matter could be recovered from 5d kaluza - klein equations in apparent vacuum .",
    "this approach is guaranteed by campbell s theorem that any solution of the einstein equations in n- dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of ( n+1)- dimensions.@xmath9 an important result of the 5d bounce model is that a time variable cosmological `` constant '' can be isolated out , in a natural way , from the induced 4d energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the 5d bounce solution contains two arbitrary functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown in ref . [ 10 ] that by properly choosing @xmath10 and @xmath11 , one can obtain exact solutions suitable to describe both the radiation - dominated universe and the matter - dominated universe as in the standard frw models . in this paper",
    "we will show that by properly choosing @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we can also obtain exact solutions suitable to describe our present accelerating universe which is dominated by dark energy .",
    "the 5d cosmological solution reads@xmath7    @xmath14    here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions , @xmath17 is the three - dimensional curvature index @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a constant .",
    "this solution satisfies the 5d equations @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "so one has @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "[ 15 - 20 ] . this solution can also be used to construct exact brane cosmological models.@xmath25    the 4d part of the empty 5d metric ( [ 5dmetric ] ) gives an exact solution of the 4d einstein equations with an effective or induced energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it was shown in ref . [ 10 ] that this energy - momentum tensor could be modeled by a perfect fluid with density @xmath26 and pressure @xmath27 , plus a cosmological term @xmath0 :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the 4-velocity . furthermore , suppose the equation of state being of the form @xmath30 , then the solution gives    @xmath31 .",

    "from the metric ( [ 5dmetric ] ) we see that the form @xmath38 is invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath39 .",
    "this would enable us to fix one of the two arbitrary functions @xmath10 and @xmath13 , leaving another to account for the various content of the cosmic matter .",
    "since @xmath0  is a variable function , one can not simply set @xmath40 or @xmath41 constant without losing the generality of the solution .",
    "therefore , to compare the 5d solution with the @xmath40 frw models , a constraint was used in ref .",

    "the universe is dominated by dark energy .",
    "for @xmath67 we have @xmath113 in agreement approximately with observations of the present stage of our universe .",
    "the `` big bounce '' solution ( [ 5dmetric ] ) is characterized by having a `` bounce '' , rather than a `` bang '' , as the `` beginning '' of our expanding universe , and by having a evolving cosmological `` constant '' .",
    "mathematically , the general solution ( [ 5dmetric ] ) contains two arbitrary functions @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "different choices of these two functions may give different models to describe different stages of our universe .",
    "in this paper we find that a simple choice of them yields a simple exact solution ( [ exactab ] ) which can describe the present accelerating universe in a satisfactory manner .",
    "we should emphasize that although this simple exact solution exhibits many interesting features of the bounce model , it has to be generalized to meet more observations and to explain the bouncing from a physical point of view .",
    "for instance , the two arbitrary functions @xmath10 and @xmath13 might be not as simple as given in ( [ fixedfunctions ] ) for a real cosmological model .",
    "meanwhile , a variable cosmological `` constant '' might be also too simple to describe dark energy .",
    "it is known from literatures@xmath114 that a properly chosen scalar field might be more suitable to describe dark energy .",
    "be aware that our model ( [ 5dmetric ] ) is 5d empty and 4d sourceful with an induced 4d energy - momentum tensor which has been supposed to contain a cosmological term @xmath0 as shown in ( [ einsteintensor : ] ) .",
    "thus , instead of a @xmath0 term , we probably should consider the case where the induced matter contains a scalar field as a component .",
    "we wish this scalar field may provide us with a mechanics to explain the acceleration as well as the bouncing of the universe .",
    "we are going to do this in future studies ."
