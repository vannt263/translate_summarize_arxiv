    "recent x - ray spectra obtained by _",
    "asca _ have revealed the presence of ionized material along the cylinder  of  sight in a large fraction ( 5075% ) of seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1998a , hereafter g98 ) . to - date",
    ", this material has been detected primarily due to the bound - free absorption edges of ovii(739  ev ) and oviii(871  ev ) imprinted on the underlying x - ray continuum , although additional edges due to other ions have been detected in some objects .",
    "the depths of the absorption features ( and hence accuracy to which they can be determined ) vary from object - to - object , with sources having implied column densities covering a range @xmath10few@xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "both these limits on the column density most likely arise only as a result of the combination of the moderate spectral resolution of the _ asca _ detectors and the signal  to  ratio of most of the datasets currently available . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the optical depths ( at the respective threshold energies ) of both ovii and oviii are @xmath14 , making the unequivocal detection of such features extremely difficult . for @xmath15 , bound - free absorption edges due to other ionized elements ( most notably due to c , n , ne @xmath1-shell and fe @xmath16-shell transitions ) become increasingly important and finally dominate the opacity if the absorbing material has cosmic abundances , making the determination of the precise strength of the ovii and oviii edges difficult without detailed modelling .",
    "nevertheless , even the current limits show that the column density of ionized material along the cylinder  of  sight far exceeds that of neutral material in the majority of seyfert 1 galaxies . assuming a standard abundance ratio of oxygen ( o / h@xmath17 ) the observed range of @xmath18 implies total hydrogen column densities for seyfert 1 galaxies as a class covering the range @xmath19 .",
    "it should be stressed that these values of @xmath20 are _ lower _ limits since the column density of oxygen with ionization states @xmath21ovii and of fully stripped oxygen ions is unknown .    as first suggested by halpern ( 1984 ) , the material responsible for these features is generally considered to be photoionized by the intense radiation field of the nucleus .",
    "detailed photoionization models have been successfully applied to the existing x - ray data .",
    "the location and geometry of this highly ionized material is currently unclear .",
    "it is also unclear how the material responsible for the features observed in the x - ray band is related ( if at all ) to the associated absorbers ( primarily resonant absorption lines due to li",
    "- like species of c and n ) commonly seen in the uv band in these objects ( e.g. crenshaw 1997 ) and some attempts have been made to link the two ( eg .",
    "mathur 1994 ; shields & hamann 1997 ) . since the uv absorption features with cores very close to zero intensity ( eg .",
    "crenshaw , maran , mushotzky 1998 ) are seen imprinted on broad emission lines , this places the bulk of the uv - absorber outside the broad emission line region ( belr ) .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that a single screen of ionized gas in photoionization equilibrium may be too simple a model .",
    "first , the column density of the ionized gas has sometimes been seen to vary by large factors on relatively long timescales ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , fabian et al 1994 ; ngc  3783 george et al 1998b ) , in fact the first paper proposing the presence of absorption by ionized material in an active galaxy , the qso mr2251 - 178 , made this suggestion based on the variable column density ( halpern 1984 ) .",
    "second , differential variability between the depths of the ovii and oviii edges has been seen in some objects on timescales @xmath22  s ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , reynolds et al 1995 , otani et al 1996 ; ngc  4051 , guainazzi et al 1996 ) .",
    "third , a number of sources have revealed spectroscopic evidence for one or more screens of ionized gas ( e.g. ngc  3516 , kriss et al 1996 ; ngc  3783 , george et al 1998b , see also those objects with a 1  kev deficit in g98 ) . such observations are providing our first insights into the location , physical conditions and kinematics of the material in the vicinity of the x - ray source .",
    "the nucleus of the sb galaxy ngc  3227 ( @xmath23 ) is heavily reddened ( see komossa & fink 1997 , thereafter k97 , and references therein ) , which is at least partially responsible for its classification historically as both a seyfert 2 ( huchra & burg 1992 ) and seyfert 1.5 ( osterbrock & martel 1993 ) from spectroscopy of the optical emission lines .",
    "evidence for substantial amounts of neutral material within the galaxy is also provided by the detection of hi ( mundell et al 1995a ) and oh ( rickard , bania & turner 1982 ) absorption , along with co ( e.g. rigopoulou et al 1997 and references therein ) and h@xmath24co ( tentatively ; baan , haschick & uglesich 1993 ) emission . the host galaxy appears to be interacting with a nearby companion , ngc  3226 ( eg .",
    "arp 1966 ) .",
    "the radio , ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` and h@xmath25 emission reveal asymmetrical physical conditions on the opposing sides of the nucleus and a misalignment between the collimation of the radio emitting plasma and that of the photoionizing continuum ( e.g. mundell et al 1995b ; gonzlez delgado & prez 1997 ) .",
    "resolved spectroscopy of the circumnuclear regions have revealed evidence that the belr ( and hence perhaps the nucleus itself ) is off - set from the center of rotation by @xmath9250  pc ( mediavilla & arribas 1993 ; arribas & mediavilla 1994 ) .    in the x - ray band ,",
    "ngc  3227 was first detected in the _ ariel - v _ sky - survey and has been observed subsequently by all major x - ray instruments ( e.g. malizia et al 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "of particular note are the results from the _ exosat _   observations , which revealed differential variability between the soft and medium x - ray bands ( turner & pounds 1989 ) , and the _ ginga _  observations which suggested an asymmetric profile for the fe @xmath26 emission line ( pounds et al 1989 ; george , nandra & fabian 1990 ) and evidence for an fe @xmath1-shell absorption edge ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "_ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations of ngc  3227 in 1993 have revealed the presence of ionized material within the cylinder  of  sight ( e.g. ptak et al 1994 ; k97 ; reynolds 1997 ; g98 ) .",
    "the values derived from @xmath20 and @xmath27 are some of the lowest yet reliably measured in a seyfert galaxy , which may be related to the relatively low luminosity of the source ( @xmath28 in the 0.110  kev band ) .",
    "the @xmath20 is similar to that necessary to give rise to the reddening observed in the optical and uv bands if the ionized material contains embedded dust with a gas  to  dust ratio and composition similar to that seen in our galaxy ( k97 ; g98 ) .    here ,",
    "for the first time , we present the results from the analysis of an _ asca _  observation of ngc  3227 performed in 1995 may .",
    "we also describe the results from a re - analysis of an earlier _ asca _  observation carried out in 1993 may , along with those from a contemporaneous _ rosat _  observation .",
    "the observations are described in  [ sec : obs ] , and the preliminary data reduction and temporal analysis in  [ sec : screening ] .",
    "we show that ngc  3227 exhibits significant energy - dependent variations both within and between the two epochs . in  [ sec : mean - spectra ] we consider the time - averaged spectra at each epoch in order to parameterize the significant change in the observed continuum and between 1993 and 1995 , and to parameterize the fe @xmath1 emission evident during both epochs .",
    "we present a more detailed analysis of the energy - dependent variability within each observation in  [ sec : timeres ] using both an x - ray color analysis and time - resolved spectral analysis . in  [ sec : discuss ] we review our findings in the context of the previous results from this and similar objects and briefly discuss the prospects in the future , and in  [ sec : conc ] present our conclusions .",
    "the new _ asca _  observation of ngc  3227 reported here was carried out over the period 1995 may 1516 , we have also performed a re - analysis of the _ asca _  observation from 1993 may 0809 , described previously in ptak et al ( 1994 ) , reynolds ( 1997 ) , nandra et al ( 1997a , b ) , and g98 . here",
    "we utilize raw data from the rev2 processing , along with new screening criteria and the latest calibration files .",
    "these changes result in slightly different values for some parameters compared to the results published previously .",
    "details on the _ asca _  satellite , its instrumentation and performance can be found in makishima et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and references therein .",
    "the _ rosat _ observation of ngc  3227 reported here was performed over the period 1993 may 08 - 19 with the pspc in the focal plane .",
    "the results from this observation have been reported previously by k97 and are included again here to enable us to compare the results to the contemporaneous _ asca _ data .",
    "our analysis differs slightly from that used by k97 since we make use of a different analysis package ( ftools ) and include the latest spatial and temporal gain corrections for the data .",
    "details on the _ rosat _  satellite , its instrumentation and performance can be found in briel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and references therein .",
    "the full observing log is given in table  1 .",
    "[ sec : ros - screening ]    the unscreened _ asca _  event files containing data collected in faint and bright data modes were combined , as were data obtained during all three telemetry modes .",
    "these data were then screened using the ascascreen / xselect script ( v0.39 ) within the ftools package ( v4.0 ) .",
    "the screening criteria used were as given in nandra et al ( 1997a ) , with the exception that the elevation angle above the earth s limb was @xmath29 for the sis0 data obtained in 1993 , and that the ccd pixel threshold was @xmath2150 and @xmath21100 for the 1993 and 1995 data ( respectively ) .",
    "the original pulse - height assignment for each event was converted to a pulse - invariant ( pi ) scale using sispi ( v1.1 ) . in the case of the gis data ( only ) hard particle flares",
    "were rejected using the so - called ho2 count rate , and standard rise - time rejection criteria employed .",
    "these criteria resulted in effective exposure times of @xmath30  ks and @xmath939  ks in each sis and gis ( respectively ) during the 1993 observations , and @xmath31  ks and @xmath937  ks during the 1995 observations .",
    "the cleaned _ rosat _  event file , produced using the standard screening criteria provided by sass ( v7.9 ) , was extracted from the heasarc archive .",
    "the latest corrections were then applied for the spatial and temporal variations in the gain of the pspc ( see snowden et al 1995 ) using pcsasscor ( v1.1.0 ) , pctcor ( v1.1.0 ) and pcecor ( v1.2.0 ) .",
    "the effective exposure amounted to 19.5  ks spread over an 11 day period .",
    "[ sec : spatial ]    images were extracted for each instrument during each observation . in all cases , a bright source was detected with an x - ray centroid consistent with the optical position of ngc  3227 to within the uncertainty in the positional accuracy of the attitude reconstruction of the respective satellite .    as has been previously noted by radecke ( 1997 ) , a number of serendipitous sources are evident within the central 20  arcmin of the field - of - view of the _ rosat _  pspc .",
    "all are relatively weak ( with count rates in the 0.22.0  kev band a factor @xmath32% of that from ngc  3227 ) .",
    "only one of the serendipitous sources ( which we tentatively identify as ngc  3226 , with a count rate of @xmath33 in the 0.22.0  kev band ) lies close enough to affect the analysis of the pspc data from ngc  3227 , and this has been excluded from the regions used to extract the source and background data .",
    "no serendipitous sources were detected in the _ asca _ images . given the weakness of ngc  3226 and all other sources in the immediate vicinity , we consider it unlikely they contaminate significantly the analysis of the _ asca _  data from ngc  3227 .",
    "extraction cells were defined for the subsequent temporal and spectral analysis . in the case of the _ asca _",
    "sis data , a circular extraction cell of radius @xmath34  arcmin was centered on ngc  3227 . in the case of the 1995 observations , the image of ngc  3227",
    "was centered close to the standard position on the default ccd chip of each sis .",
    "the source region lies completely within the active region of the chip , and from the point - spread function ( psf ) of the xrt / sis instrument , contains @xmath35% of the total source counts .",
    "however , in the 1993 observation all four chips were active on each sis and ngc  3227 was centered on the default ccd chip , but within @xmath36  arcmin of the corner of the chip closest to the intersection of the @xmath37 ccd array . in principle , the data collected by all 4 chips can be combined . however , given the differences between the various ccds comprising each sis detector , here we choose to analyse only the photons falling on the nominal , better - calibrated ccd of each sis . thus the extraction cells used were circles , but excluding all regions beyond the active area of the nominal chip . from the psf",
    ", we estimate these cells included @xmath38% and @xmath39% of the total source counts for sis0 and sis1 respectively .",

    "an annulus , centered on the source and covering @xmath419.8  arcmin was used to provide an estimate of the background .",

    "( the correction for the relative fractions of the source counts falling outside the source regions is applied within the ancillary response files . )",
    "data from the sis below 0.6 kev were excluded from the spectral analysis as it is commonly accepted that there are significant uncertainties associated with the calibration of the xrt / sis system below this energy .",
    "whilst the sis calibration is suspect at these energies , we do make use of the fact that it is considered unlikely to be in error by @xmath52% ( see below ) .",
    "the individual spectra were grouped such as to contain a minimum of 20 counts per new bin , and hence allowing @xmath53 minimization techniques to be employed within the xspec ( v10.00 ) spectral analysis package .",
    "we have adopted spectral models consisting of an underlying power - law continuum ( of photon index @xmath54 ) absorbed by a screen of neutral material at zero redshift . in all cases the column density of this material , identified as being due to absorption within our galaxy , was fixed at @xmath55 as derived from 21  cm measurements towards ngc  3227 ( murphy et al .",
    "1996 ; these authors estimate an uncertainty @xmath56 ) .",

    "is unable to distinguish absorption at @xmath57 from that at the redshift of the source .",
    "nevertheless , here we assume that these additional screens are instrinsic to ngc  3227 .",
    "models including a photoionized absorber have been suggested previously to offer the most viable explanation for features observed in this and other seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the photoionization code ion ( version ion96 ) was used to calculate the physical state of a slab of gas when illuminated by an ionizing continuum ( netzer 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "as in g98 , below 200  ev we assume an illuminating continuum typical of agn of the luminosity of ngc  3227 ( the weak ir case of netzer 1996 ) , solar abundances and a density of @xmath58 .",
    "( models with densities as low as @xmath59 give indistinguishable results . ) at energies @xmath51200  ev the ionizing continuum was assumed to be a powerlaw , and series of models were calculated assuming different x - ray spectral indices .",
    "following netzer ( 1996 ) and g98 , the dimensionless x - ray ionization parameter , @xmath27 ( defined in g98 , eqn .",
    "1 ) , is used to parameterize the intensity of the ionizing continuum in the 0.110  kev band .",
    "the conversion factors between @xmath27 and ionization parameters defined over the entire photoionizing continuum ( @xmath5113.6  ev ) for various spectral forms can be found in g98 .",
    "despite the variability exhibited by ngc  3227 at both epochs ( figs .  [",
    "fig : lc128 ] &  [ fig : all_3227_xm512 ] ) , it is useful to first consider the time - averaged spectra observed during each observation .",
    "spectra were therefore extracted using the extraction cells described in  [ sec : spatial - xtractcells ] for the whole duration of each observation .",
    "a strong emission line is present in the spectrum of ngc  3227 during both observations as a result of iron @xmath1-shell fluorescence .",

    "the characteristics of the emission line and its possible effect on the properties of the continuum and absorption are then considered in  [ sec : mean - fe ] .",
    "we first consider a model ( hereafter model  a ) in which a single powerlaw continuum is absorbed by the galactic column density @xmath60 and an additional screen of neutral material ( @xmath61 at @xmath23 ) . a statistically acceptable fit for the 1993 _ asca _ data is obtained using model  a , with a @xmath53statistic , @xmath62 for 1126 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) and best - fitting parameters listed in table  3 ( fit  1 ) . however , the extrapolation of this model below 0.6  kev gives rise to an increase in the @xmath53statistic , @xmath63 for @xmath64 additional data points ( hence @xmath65 ) , and a mean data / model ratio in the 0.40.6  kev band of @xmath66 .",

    "as noted by mundell et al ( 1995a ) this emission may represent the structure that is responsible for collimating the ultraviolet radiation giving rise to the anisotropic ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` emission observed by mundell et al ( 1995b ) .",
    "our _ asca _ observations imply that the column density of neutral material within the narrow cylinder  of  sight to the central x - ray source ( with a diameter @xmath204  light - seconds ) is a factor @xmath92 smaller than the mean value of @xmath205 on scale - sizes a factor @xmath206 larger .",
    "we postpone the discussion of the large addition column density observed during the 1995 observations ( which as noted in  [ sec : mean-1995 ] is formally consistent with neutral material ) until  [ sec : disc - variable - abso ]      the 1993 data provide evidence for absorption by a screen of ionized material with column density @xmath2 and an x - ray ionization parameter @xmath207 .",
    "absorption by ionized material is believed to be a common feature in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies ( reynolds 1997 ; g98 ) and these values of @xmath20 and @xmath27 are some of the lowest yet observed .",
    "g98 found a range @xmath19 and @xmath208 for ionized absorbers in a sample of seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "ngc  3227 has a relatively low x - ray luminosity ( @xmath28 in the 210  kev band ) compared to other seyfert  1s in that sample ( @xmath209@xmath210 ) , and this may affect conditions in the absorber . also , as noted in  [ sec : intro ] , the optical depths of ovii and oviii are @xmath14 for @xmath211 making it difficult to detect with the signal - to - noise ratio of most _ asca _ observations .",
    "the column density appeared to increase between 1993 and 1995 , consistent with a cloud moving into the cylinder  of  sight .",
    "as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : mean-1995 ] , the _ asca _  data are only able to constrain the ionization parameter to be @xmath85 during this epoch ( i.e. consistent with neutral material ) .",
    "however , the 1993 data clearly show evidence that the absorber is ionized and in the context of this model the appearance of such a cloud increased the column of ionized material by an order of magnitude . these results are consistent with the suggestion of turner & pounds ( 1989 ) that the differential variability between the soft and medium x - ray bands seen in the _ exosat",
    "_  observations of ngc  3227 is most likely due to variations in the absorbing column .",
    "_ ginga _",
    "observations revealed evidence for an fe @xmath1-shell absorption edge , with a depth corresponding to @xmath212few@xmath213 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the current _ asca _  data do not allow any meaningful constraints to be placed on such a feature .",
    "dust is clearly present at some locations within the host galaxy , as revealed by the detection of molecular emission and absorption features ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) and implied by two thermal components observed in the 10300@xmath214 m band ( rodrguez espinosa et al 1996 ) . in common with many other seyfert galaxies , the component dominating the 1030@xmath214 m band ( with a temperature @xmath9160  k ) is likely to arise as a result of the heating of dust by radiation sources @xmath215  kpc from the nucleus ( e.g. rodrguez espinosa & prez garca 1997 ) .",
    "both the active nucleus and emission from any starburst activity provide such radiation sources .",
    "the question here is whether any dust exists within the immediate circumnuclear regions ( @xmath215  pc ) and , if so , whether it is in any way related to the ionized absorber .",
    "as reviewed by k97 , there are a number of indicators which can be used to probe the circumnuclear environment of ngc  3227 .",
    "first , the underlying continuum in the optical and uv bands is unusually red compared to other seyfert galaxies ( winge et al 1995 ) . using the ratio of the observed fluxes at 125  nm and 220  nm ( rest frame , which are relatively free of line emission ) and a standard galactic composition for the dust",
    ", g98 found a column density @xmath216 brought the intrinsic flux ratio into agreement with that observed in most other unobscured seyfert galaxies . making slightly different assumptions",
    "k97 obtained a similar result .",
    "second , from the observed ratio of the broad h@xmath25 and h@xmath217 lines and assuming a galactic dust / gas mass ratio , k97 calculate an effective hydrogen column density to the broad emission line region of @xmath218 .",
    "as noted by netzer ( 1990 ) the use of such line ratios in this way is potentially misleading as the intrinsic balmer decrement is uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the implied column density is similar to that required to produce the observed reddening of the optical / uv continuum .",
    "thus it seems likely that the same ( dusty ) material is responsible for these observational characteristics .",
    "the material must lie at a radius larger than of the belr ( @xmath91020 light - days , salamanca et al 1994 ; winge et al 1995 ) both in order to give rise to a depressed ratio of the intensity of broad h@xmath25 and h@xmath217 lines , and since dust is unable to survive for long in the intense radiation field of the central source at smaller radii ( e.g. laor & draine 1993 ) .",
    "interestingly the column density implied from such arguments ( @xmath9few@xmath219 ) is very similar to that of the ionized absorber implied by the _ rosat",
    "_ observations ( k97 ) and that derived from the _ asca _  observations in 1993 ( above ; g98 ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that this is purely coincidental . as suggested by k97 and g98 , it is more plausible that a substantial fraction of the ionized gas in ngc  3227 contains embedded dust , thus placing the ionized absorber _",
    "outside _ the belr .",
    "dusty ionized absorbers have also been suggested in the infrared - bright quasar iras  133349 + 2438 ( brandt , fabian & pounds 1996 ) and the seyfert mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ; g98 ) .",
    "as pointed out in k97 , the presence of dust can give rise to different model spectra , primarily as a result of the different depletion of the various elements in the gas - phase .",
    "we have not attempted a detailed treatment of such cases here as most of the differences occur at energies below the _ asca _  bandpass .",
    "if the dust is similar to that observed within the interstellar medium of the galaxy , the composition of the gas - phase will be depleted in c and o by factor of @xmath220 and @xmath221 ( respectively ) compared to `` cosmic composition '' , and n and ne suffering no significant depletion ( e.g. cowie & songaila 1986 ) . as can be from fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_ufmodelratio ] , the main features imprinted on the underlying continuum in the _ asca _  bandpass by the ionized absorber are due to ovii and oviii .",
    "thus if there is indeed embedded dust , and thus o is depleted in the gas - phase , one might expect the values of @xmath20 derived above to have been underestimated by a factor @xmath222 .",
    "the differential depletion of the various elements gives rise to a subtle changes in the form of the spectrum across the 0.61  kev band .",
    "given the interplay between @xmath20 and @xmath27 during the spectral fitting of _ asca _  data , the effect of including dust is more likely to increase the best - fitting value of @xmath27 ( by a factor @xmath202 compared to dust - free models ) rather than @xmath20 .",
    "future observations with the grating - spectrometers onboard _ axaf _ and _ xmm _ will allow a direct comparison between the depths of the edges from the highly - ionized , gas - phase ions and those of the neutral , dust - phase species .",
    "such observations will therefore provide stringent constraints on any dust embedded within the ionized gas .      in the absence of other sources of heating and cooling",
    ", the gas will be in photoionization equilibrium if the photoionization and recombination timescales of the dominant species ( @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively ) are shorter than the timescale ( @xmath225 ) for large - amplitude variations in the intensity of the illuminating continuum .",
    "to first order @xmath226 . thus substituting the mean values derived from the 1993 observations ( @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) , we have @xmath229 .",
    "the recombination time of oviii is longer than that for ovii and given by @xmath224(oviii ) @xmath230 for a gas at an equilibrium temperature @xmath231 ( e.g. verner & ferland 1996 ) .",
    "thus for plausible values of @xmath231 ( @xmath232  k ) , @xmath223 is more important than @xmath224(oviii ) when determining whether or not material illuminated by a variable ionizing continuum will be in equilibrium .",
    "thus the material will be equilibrium ( @xmath233 ) when @xmath234 .",
    "unfortunately the assignment of an appropriate value for @xmath225 is problematic since little is know about the detailed variability characteristics of ngc  3227 in the x - ray band and , as a class , seyfert 1 galaxies appear to exhibit a red - noise power - density spectrum ( e.g. lawrence & papadakis 1993 ; green , mchardy & lehto 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "however for illustration , here we assume @xmath235 ( the approximate timescale in which factor @xmath92 changes in flux are observed during the temporal period 1993(t3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc128 ] ) , leading to the requirement that @xmath236 for the ionized absorber to be in equilibrium .",
    "such a density is consistent with that assumed in our ion models for the ionized material . from the definition of @xmath27 and assuming @xmath237 , such values of @xmath238 require @xmath239 light - days .",
    "thus , if the ionized absorber contains embedded dust ( as suggested in ",
    "[ sec : dusty ] ) it must be at a larger radius and hence will _ not _ be in perfect equilibrium for some time after the temporal period 1993(t3 ) . unfortunately , however , it is impossible to quantify just how far out of equilibrium the ionized material may have become , or the time taken for equilibrium to be restored , without a detailed knowledge of the ionized material , and a complete knowledge of the variations in the ionizing continuum both before temporal period 1993(t1 ) and after temporal period 1993(t4 ) .",
    "in  [ sec : mean - cont ] we found the absorbing column density to have increased by a factor @xmath8 ( from @xmath152 to @xmath158 ) between the 1993 and 1995 observations .",
    "as noted in  [ sec : mean-1995 ] the _ asca _  data do not allow us to place stringent constraints on the ionization state of the material during the latter epoch , with value of @xmath240 ( neutral material ) to @xmath241 ( highly ionized ) being consistent with the observations . we suggest that the most likely explanation is that a cloud of material moved into the cylinder  of  sight .",
    "the location and kinematics of such a cloud clearly can not be determined with the current data . however within some radius keplarian motion ( alone ) is able to move material completely through the cylinder  of  sight ( of diameter equal to the size of the x - ray emitting region ) in the 2 years between the observations .",
    "the x - ray emitting region in ngc  3227 can be estimated to be @xmath242 light - seconds across from the variability behaviour observed during 1993 . from g98 ,",
    "the fiducial radius is @xmath243 light - days , where @xmath244 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath245 is the fraction of the eddington luminosity at which the object is emitting .",
    "thus , for ngc  3227 ( with @xmath246 ) and assuming @xmath247  few , it is feasible that tranverse motion of a cloud within the inner regions of the agn responsible for the change in column density . it would be interesting to see whether any of the other reddening indicators in ngc  3227 vary on a timescale of years , especially the reddening towards the belr .      during the 1995 observations we found spectroscopic evidence for @xmath199% of the observed continuum to be unattenuated by the absorber with @xmath248 .",
    "such a model is consistent with both the case where only a fraction of the cylinder  of  sight to ngc  3227 is covered by the absorbing material ( say in the form of clouds ) , and to the case where the whole cylinder  of  sight is covered by the material but in which a fraction of the continuum escapes by another light - path .",
    "we consider both explanations equally plausible .",
    "the latter , however , raises the question as to the location and conditions within the material responsible for scattering the unattenuated component back into our cylinder  of  sight .",
    "since we find no evidence for any strong emission or absorption features in the spectrum at energies @xmath249  kev , the material must be highly ionized .",
    "in particular we see no evidence for any emission lines due to the h - like and he - like species of the abundant elements which are commonly seen in the scattered x - ray spectra of seyfert  2 galaxies ( e.g. turner et al 1997 ) , with upper limits @xmath250  ev at 90% confidence .",
    "unfortunately any variations in the xm@xmath47 and xm@xmath48 bands during the 1995 observations ( which are dominated by the scattered and transmitted components respectively under this hypothesis ) are of insufficient amplitude to offer any insight into the location of the material responsible for scattering .",
    "finally , we note that the x - ray spectrum of ngc  3227 during this epoch is rather similar to that of ngc  4151 ( weaver et al 1994a , b ; g98 ) , although the latter source has @xmath251% and a somewhat larger value of @xmath20 at most epochs .",
    "our data confirm the presence of fe @xmath1-shell emission within ngc  3227 , with an equivalent width @xmath9100300  ev .",
    "we find evidence that the emission line is broad , most likely with an asymmetric profile .",
    "thus our findings confirm the suggestion from the earlier _ ginga _  observations ( e.g. george , nandra & fabian 1990 ) , and show that the fe @xmath1-shell emission within ngc  3227 is fairly typical of other seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. nandra et al 1997b , and references within ) and some seyfert 2 galaxies ( turner et al 1998 ) .",
    "we find no compelling evidence that the fe emission varied in either shape or equivalent width either within the individual observations or between the 1993 and 1995 epochs .",
    "thus we find no evidence for significant changes in the distribution of fe emissivity .",
    "observations of ngc  3227 performed during 1993 and 1995 show evidence for marked spectral variability both within and between the observations .",
    "the source shows evidence for a column @xmath2 of ionized material with an x - ray ionization parameter @xmath3 during 1993 , increasing by an order of magnitude by the 1995 epoch .",
    "the slope of the continuum steepened by @xmath6 during a flare within the 1993 observation .",
    "however , the data do not allow us to distinguish between a steepening of the primary continuum , or a change in the relative strengths of the power - law and a putative compton - reflection component .",

    "<S> we present the results from _ asca _  observations of ngc  3227 performed during 1993 and 1995 , along with those from a _ rosat _  observation performed pseudo - simultaneously with the former . </S>",
    "<S> we find the 0.610  kev continuum to be consistent with a powerlaw with a photon index @xmath0 , flatter than that typically observed in seyfert galaxies confirming previous results . </S>",
    "<S> significant fe @xmath1-shell emission is observed during both epochs , with an equivalent width and profile typical of seyfert 1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the _ asca _ observations in 1993 reveal absorption by a screen @xmath2 of ionized material with an x - ray ionization parameter @xmath3 . both the column and ionization - state of this material are at the low end of the distribution of parameters observed for seyfert  1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> joint analysis of the _ asca _  and _ rosat _ data at this epoch show an additional screen of neutral material instrinsic to ngc  3227 with @xmath4few@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find ngc  3227 to exhibit significant spectral variability both within and between the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation involves short - term variability in the continuum emission and longer - term variability in the column density of the ionized material . </S>",
    "<S> time - resolved spectroscopy and color  color analysis indicate that the slope of the continuum steepened by @xmath6 during a flare of duration @xmath7s , within the 1993 observation . </S>",
    "<S> however we were unable to distinguish between a steepening of the primary continuum and a change in the relative strengths of the power - law and a putative compton - reflection component . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing column increased by a factor of @xmath8 by the 1995 epoch , while the continuum is consistent with that observed in 1993 . the 1995 data also show evidence that the warm absorber allows @xmath910% of the nuclear emission to escape without attenuation .    </S>",
    "<S> we review our findings in the context of the previous results from this and similar objects and discuss the prospects of future observations . </S>"
