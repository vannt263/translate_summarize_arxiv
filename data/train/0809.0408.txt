    "the discovery by belle @xcite of the very narrow narrow @xmath1 resonance has revived the interest in heavy quarkonium , both experimentally and theoretically . the observation of @xmath1 has been confirmed by cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite and babar collaborations @xcite .",
    "other charmonium - like states , as for example @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite have been uncovered in b - factory experiments .",
    "a partial list is shown in table [ exotics ] .",
    "several review papers , as for example @xcite , discuss the difficulty of interpreting these resonances as charmonium states .",
    "seen as exotics , they can possibly be tetraquarks , meson - meson molecules , hybrids , glueballs , etc .",
    ".properties of newly discovered charmonium - like resonances [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     whatever picture is adopted , it is important to properly determine the charge conjugation number @xmath5 of the resonance . from table",
    "[ exotics ] one can see that @xmath5 is known in nearly all cases . here",
    "we shall discuss the tetraquark option , for example @xcite , and the molecular option , for example @xcite or @xcite , where we noticed that some difficulty has been encountered in defining it .",
    "we recall the definition of tetraquark basis states as given in refs . @xcite .",
    "this basis can provide a direct connection with the diquark - antidiquark states @xcite and also with the molecular states @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we suppose that the particle 1 is the charmed quark @xmath6 , the particle 2 a light quark @xmath7 , particle 3 the anticharmed quark @xmath8 and particle 4 a light antiquark @xmath9 .",
    "the total wave function of a tetraquark is a linear combination of products of orbital , spin , flavour and colour parts .",
    "we shall successively introduce the orbital , colour and spin parts of the wave function .",
    "the flavor part is fixed .",
    "there are at least three possible ways to define the relative coordinates .",
    "the three relevant possibilities for our problem are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the cases @xmath10 and @xmath11 the internal coordinates are @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 the first system of coordinates is convenient when the quarks or antiquarks are correlated to form diquarks , as in the diquark - antidiquark model . the coordinates ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) called direct and exchange meson - meson channels , are useful in describing strong decays or introduce a molecular picture @xcite , provided a quark structure is imposed at short separations .",
    "one should use the system which is more appropriate for a given problem .",
    "but in specific calculations one can pass from one coordinate system to the other by orthogonal transformations @xcite .      in the colour space",
    "one can construct a colour singlet tetraquark state using intermediate couplings associated to the three coordinate systems defined above . in this way one obtains three distinct bases",
    "@xcite @xmath15 ) the states 3 and @xmath16 are antisymmetric and 6 and @xmath17 are symmetric under interchange of quarks or antiquarks .",
    "this basis is convenient in a diquark - antidiquark picture . in ref .",
    "@xcite only the @xmath18 state has been considered which restricts the spectrum to half of the allowed states @xcite .",
    "the sets ( [ directcolour ] ) or ( [ exchangecolour ] ) , contain a singlet - singlet colour and an octet - octet colour state .",
    "the amplitude of the latter vanishes asymptotically when a tetraquark decays into two mesons .",
    "these are called _ hidden colour _ states , by analogy to states which appear in the nucleon - nucleon problem . when the amplitude of a _ hidden colour _ state is far the most dominant in the wave function , the corresponding open channel acquires , in exchange , a tiny value for its amplitude and in this way the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite explained the small width of @xmath1 , when interpreted as a @xmath19 tetraquark .",
    "as the quarks and antiquarks are spin 1/2 particles , the total spin of a tetraquark can be @xmath20 or 2 .",
    "this can be obtained by first coupling two particles to each other and then couple the two subsystems together .",
    "let us denote the intermediate coupling states between two quarks ( antiquarks ) by @xmath21 for spin 0 ( scalar ) and by @xmath22 for spin 1 ( axial ) .",
    "for a quark - antiquark pair we denote the states by @xmath23 for spin 0 ( pseudoscalar ) and by @xmath24 for spin 1 ( vector ) .",
    "we need their permutation symmetry properties under a given transposition @xmath25 . for quark ( antiquark ) pairs we have @xmath26 and @xmath27 for quark - antiquark pairs we have @xmath28 and @xmath29    for @xmath30 there are two independent basis states for each channel .",
    "the bases associated to ( [ diquark ] ) , ( [ directcolour ] ) and ( [ exchangecolour ] ) are @xmath31 there are three independent states in each channel , to be identified by three distinct young tableaux .",
    "as an example we give the basis for the direct meson - meson channel @xcite @xmath32 the lower index indicates the total spin 1 .",
    "the case @xmath33 is trivial .",
    "there is a single state    @xmath34    which is symmetric under any permutation of particles .",
    "we deal with the ground state , _",
    "we have @xmath35 . making the identification 1 = @xmath6 , 2 = @xmath36 , 3 = @xmath37 and 4 = @xmath38 , introduced above , it is convenient to first couple 1 to 3 and 2 to 4 and then the subsystem 13 to 24 , as in fig .",
    "the charge conjugation is equivalent to applying the permutation ( 13)(24 ) to the wave function .",
    "from the properties ( [ transp13 ] ) and ( [ transp24 ] ) one can see that the spin states ( [ directcolour0 ] ) and ( [ spin2 ] ) remain unchanged under the permutation ( 13)(24 ) .",
    "it follows that the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 have charge conjugation @xmath41 .    for @xmath42",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated .",
    "there are six linearly independent basis vectors built as products of colour ( [ directcolour ] ) and spin ( [ directcolour1 ] ) states .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 change sign thus have charge conjugation @xmath47 . on the other hand @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "do not change sign , thus have charge conjugation @xmath50 .",
    "also , by construction , they correspond to tetraquarks where the spin of the @xmath51 pair is @xmath52 .          @xmath56 one can express @xmath57 in terms of @xmath53 or vice - versa .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 from the properties of @xmath53 one can infer that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not have a definite charge conjugation .",
    "contrary , @xmath68 and @xmath69 have @xmath70 , because they are linear combinations of states with @xmath70 .",
    "inverting the above relations one can obtain @xmath53 in terms of @xmath57 .",
    "we have , for example @xmath71 section 3.1 implies that both @xmath72 and @xmath73 have @xmath41 . from the identification 1 = @xmath6 , 2 = @xmath36 , 3 = @xmath37 and 4 = @xmath38 and the definitions ( [ eq : betai ] ) it follows that @xmath74 thus one has @xmath75",
    "@xmath76 where the second component is a _ hidden colour _ state with the same spin structure as @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that a molecular structure with @xmath41 can be obtained only from the difference @xmath72 plus its _ hidden colour _ counterpart . except for this part ,",
    "our result is in agreement with the discussion given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in disagreement with the molecular interpretation of ref .",
    "the _ hidden colour _ component with @xmath41 can influence the energy of the system at short separations @xcite .",
    "such contributions have been ignored in the simple molecular picture , because the molecules are point - like particles @xcite .",
    "one can also find that @xmath78 which show that @xmath79 and @xmath80 have @xmath70 .",
    "thus the ( open channel ) molecular state with @xmath47 reads @xmath81 again in agreement with ref .",
    "interestingly , its hidden channel counterpart , @xmath80 is completely decoupled from the open channel ( [ open ] ) .",
