    "although there are a myriad of treatises dealing the velocity of an object passing trough a gravitational field , we can hardly find procedures or expressions in terms of independent and fundamental variables .",
    "the formulas are extracted from the keplerian and classical gravitation laws , and generally they contain a series of orbital parameters most of them achieved from experimental observations .",
    "so , it is not so easy to distinguish the exact role of each physical variable , even in the most rigorous procedures . in the present article , a series of calculations will be performed to express the orbital speed in terms of fundamental and physically observable variables .",
    "principally , the results of a previous report will be used @xcite . in that note ,",
    "the intensity field evolution was predicted at a given point moving at relative constant speed respect to an electromagnetic source .",
    "taking into account the source emission mechanism , fundamentally a decreasing potential with the distance growth , and pointing out the geometrical parameters of the physical environment , the dynamics of the system was analytically described . as shown ,",
    "the results agree with the solutions obtained by the classical physical treatises , for instance the retarded potential evaluation , despite the greater simplicity .",
    "synthetically , in the cited note , the space - time scalar parameter which determines the potential energy , the quantity @xmath0 ( there , @xmath1 called ) does not correspond simply to the real distance between the source and the observation point , but it is the sum of the real distance plus the distance between the same objects evaluated at the instant when the intensity field was null . in the present note , taking into account the analogy of the electromagnetic and gravitational field , the same criterion will be employed . in summary , in the next sections , the basic statements of the previous procedure will be highlighted , then the analytical formula will be used to calculate the orbital speed , adopting as orbital parameters the potential energy of the system and the initial momentum of the moving object .",
    "the specific case of a constant energy potential will reveal a natural and strong connection with the elliptical trajectory . in light of these statements , the trajectories and the orbital velocity of the solar system planets will be examined .",
    "let s consider a body with mass @xmath2 at the position @xmath3 at the instant @xmath4 , in a spatial reference system with origin into @xmath5 , as shown in fig[space1 ] .",
    "( note : from now on , only a two - dimensional space will be considered ) .",
    "initially , in absence of field , it moves at velocity @xmath6 .",
    "presuming the point @xmath7 as the center of the mass generating the gravitational field , the aim is to characterize the system at instant @xmath4 , from the physical point of view .",
    "as previously demonstrated @xcite , at that space - time coordinates , the intensity of a field propagating at light - speed @xmath8 , depends on @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is the real path covered during the time interval @xmath10 @xcite , being @xmath11 such that r = c(t - t_0 ) [ r0 ] and r= [ r_general ] where @xmath12 .    considering the time parameter as an independent and linear variable",
    ", @xmath4 and @xmath11 must belong to the same time reference line ( fig.[time ] ) .",
    "it is fundamental and useful to define an intermediate instant @xmath13 , on the same time line , in such a way t = t+  t_0=t- [ def_t ]    at same time , in terms of space coordinates , we find @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the relative length @xmath16 .",
    "being @xmath17 and @xmath18 the distances of the object from the center point @xmath7 respectively at time @xmath4 and @xmath11 , it results r = d_t+d_0 .",
    "[ r_sum ]    rotating the reference system of an angle @xmath19 so that @xmath20 ( fig.[space2 ] ) , the relation [ r_general ] becomes r=|x_t - x_0| [ r_beta ] and the same length @xmath0 can be expressed also in the following ways r=2 , [ r1 ]    r=2 .",
    "meaning the trajectory as just the set of the covered spatial positions , the four eqs.[r_sum]-[r2 ] are enough for defining it .",
    "also a reference system where @xmath21 is necessary , and it is essential to underline that it is always possible to perform such a choice , without invalidating the metric properties of the system .",
    "that is easily understandable looking at the eqs.[r_sum]-[r2 ] , and considering the spatial transformation invariance of the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "so , regarding that equations , they describe the physical and spatial properties of the body of mass @xmath2 , that runs into a gravitational field , just at instant @xmath4 .",
    "the relative potential energy is @xmath24 , and the momentum is @xmath25 , so considering invariant that two quantities , means keeping constant @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "+ in that conditions , for the body @xmath2 , the locus @xmath3 of the allowed positions is an ellipse + - with one focus centered into @xmath5 + - with @xmath27 , and + - with eccentricity @xmath28 , being @xmath29 the major semi axis .",
    "+ in a natural way , these statements reveal the geometrical properties of such a physical system . on the other hand ,",
    "corresponding with the first keplerian law , they disclose the intrinsic physical meaning of an orbital path . in that sense , trying to better understanding its physical properties , we can say that the eccentricity indicates the specific momentum of the orbiting body , coinciding to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 can be interpreted as the velocity of the body respect to the gravity center , before it is trapped into the gravitational field .",
    "in fact , it is natural to perceive an initial high speed object generating a strongly elliptical track , and obviously vice - versa .",
    "then , being @xmath0 expression of the potential energy , it can be invariant although it is the sum of the two variables ( eq.[r_sum ] ) , just like the ellipse outline is the locus which the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant .",
    "let s consider a practical example relative to a body having initial momentum @xmath32 that is @xmath33 , and @xmath34 in arbitrary units ( au ) .",
    "the relative elliptical trace is outlined in fig.[tra1 ] .",
    "it represents the set of possible solutions of the equation system [ r_sum]-[r2 ] . in the same figure , all the variables satisfying that equations are shown .",
    "in particular , the set of point @xmath35 corresponds to the crosshatched ellipse whose dimensions are exactly equal to the @xmath3 ellipse , with one focus anyway into @xmath36 .",
    "it is important noticing that also @xmath37 satisfies the eq.[r1 ] , as though @xmath38 satisfies [ r2 ] , making so evident the complete overlapping of the two curves for less than a space - time phase quantity , and reaffirming so the stationary configuration of the system . in the fig.[tra10 ] , there are ten closed orbits , each one with the same @xmath0 but different value for @xmath26 .",
    "the curves flatten oneself while the @xmath26 value grows .",
    "one of the two focal points is anyway steady in the origin of reference system , for each orbit .",
    "-[r2 ] are indicated for a body with momentum @xmath39 , that is @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the real orbit is described by the continuos line forming an ellipse mainly developing on the right side .",
    "it represents the only space locus @xmath3 , for the defined reference system . on the left ,",
    "the set of the points @xmath40 is crosshatched .",
    "both lines define two identical ellipses surrounding the focal points @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath7 in common , corresponding that to the origin of reference system , as well as to the center of the gravitational system .",
    "the semi axis length is @xmath43 , and the eccentricity is @xmath44 . a generic point on the trajectory",
    "is drawn with real distance @xmath22 , and the relative length @xmath23 .",
    "[ tra1 ] ]     solving the eqs.[r_sum]-[r2 ] , each one with the same length @xmath34 , and with different @xmath26 values included into the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the reference system is chosen in order to @xmath6 gets null contribute on the @xmath46 axis , i.e. @xmath47@xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the elliptical figures are easily recognizable , all of that with @xmath49 , but different eccentricities @xmath50 , each one corresponding to the fixed @xmath26 value .",
    "the curves flatten themselves while the @xmath26 value grows .",
    "[ tra10 ] ]",
    "the orbital speed expresses the dynamics of a body passing through a gravitational field , so it is characterized by the physical and spatial parameters , each time . trying to define @xmath51 ,",
    "the following hypotheses are considered : the gravity is the only force , the total mass @xmath52 of the system is concentrated into @xmath7 , so if @xmath53 is the mass at center , @xmath54 .",
    "then , taking into account the fundamental properties of the system , consecutive reasoning leads to following form + v_orb(t)== [ v_orbi1 ] where @xmath55 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath56 .    the formula [ v_orbi1 ] can be rewritten for the specific case of a stationary orbit , that is @xmath57 , and choosing a special reference system like in fig.[space2 ] where @xmath58 .",
    "so , taking into the account the relation @xmath59 , the eq.[v_orbi1 ] becomes v_orb(t)=. [ v_orbi2 ] + in fig.[speed1 ] , the orbital velocity is reported in terms of the geometrical parameters .",
    "it has been calculated by eq.[v_orbi2 ] , using the the same numerical values of fig.[tra1 ] .",
    "+    . [ speed1 ] ]    although that quantity is obviously depending on time , the last two expressions do not contain an explicit temporal term . effectively , tracing the trajectory , until now , the relative points have been considered as positions temporally independent each from the others , connecting each point to the real time @xmath4 . in spite of the presence of several time quantities , only @xmath4 defines a real position of the object , while the values @xmath13 and @xmath11 contribute to describe the physical state anyway concerning @xmath4 .",
    "thus , let s divide a body trajectory in @xmath60 points @xmath61 .",
    "each of them corresponds to the time @xmath62 , entailing so a different system configuration with own @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and the set related variables that satisfies all the previous equations .",
    "such a way , the @xmath65 value is univocally assigned to each point , by eq.[v_orbi1 ] .    with the aim to calculate the orbital time period ,",
    "let s consider an elliptical trajectory .",
    "coming after some logical steps , the following relation can be adopted t_orb= ( ^1/2_i=2^n |x_i - x_i-1|-^2/3 p_el ) [ perio ] where @xmath66 is the length of the orbit , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are consecutive abscissa coordinates related to the instants @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the perihelion length .",
    "the relation is probably to improve with further study , since in the present report the approximation level is not well defined .",
    "for performing the experimental test on the previous formulas , the solar system is considered , since it is well conformed to the physical cases debated in the previous sections . summarizing , that cases expect the trajectory that lies in a plane , a fixed center of mass @xmath7 , and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 equal to the solar mass , and @xmath2 corresponding to the single planet mass .",
    "referring to the planets ( including pluto ) of the solar system , let s trace the nine relative orbits trying to find as much as couple possible set @xmath74 of the object positions . essentially , two parameters are essential for each orbit , the major axis length @xmath75 and the eccentricity @xmath50 , two geometrical quantities to reveal from the data tables . assigning the physical meaning as seen ,",
    "that is @xmath49 and @xmath28 , these variables can be introduced into the eqs.[r_sum]-[r2 ] .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[solar1 ] and [ solar2 ] .",
    "as predicted in the previous section , the resulting trajectories are elliptical and coinciding with the true planet orbits , with the sun naturally centered in one focus , according to the keplerian law .",
    "-[r2 ] and consequently the statements contained in the section [ rif ] and [ traj ] .",
    "the experimental parameters @xmath75 and @xmath50 are been extracted from the data tables in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "[ solar1 ] ]     and [ traj ] , and from data tables in @xcite,@xcite regarding the ellipse dimensions .",
    "[ solar2 ] ]     is reported , the observational point is the sun . in the lower one ,",
    "the average distances @xmath76 are evaluated from earth .",
    "the crosshatched line is just the line of the upper graph , also there reported to improve the comparison . remembering that @xmath29 is also a physical variable being @xmath43 , while @xmath76 represents just a spatial distance , the discrepancy between the two curves is better interpreted .",
    "[ terra ] ]      the orbital speed is evaluated for each of the nine body belonging to the solar system .",
    "the eq.[v_orbi2 ] is applied along the whole trajectories , tabulating the average with the minimum and maximum values in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "that two values correspond to the object positions relatively at aphelion and perihelion .",
    "the agreement with the measurements is good especially for the minimum and maximum values that regard punctual body positions .",
    "the major discrepancy about the average value can be due to the different algorithms used for the average elaboration . in fig.[terra",
    "] , regarding the same system , the specific energy spectrum is reported .",
    "the upper graph describes the distribution of the objects in terms of major semi axis @xmath77 relative to each own orbit , meaning each average distance from sun .",
    "the lower one concerns the same data but reporting the average distance @xmath76 from earth , that is watching the same mass distribution but from another point of view .",
    "the comparison between the two curves ( the lower graph shows both ) is useful also from another perspective , considering that the variable @xmath29 is not simply a geometrical quantity but it contains an important physical significance being @xmath43 , while @xmath76 is just a spatial distance .",
    "so , not giving sufficient consideration to that difference , the interpretation of results might be ambiguous or even erroneous .",
    "the time period is calculated for each planet of the solar system and for pluto , using the eq.[perio ] . also here",
    ", there are some discrepancies with respect experimental values , as reported in the last column of the tab.[tab1 ] . anyway , the real errors can be hardly calculated since they can due to different kind of normalization with respect the experimental data .",
    "further , as said before , the eq.[perio ] probably must be better adapted , then the formula have been considered for a simplified system with just two bodies with @xmath72 , without considering other perturbations .",
    ".velocity values and orbital period for the planets of the solar system , including pluto . the formula [ v_orbi2 ] is applied .",
    "the orbital period @xmath78 is calculated by eq.[perio ] , while @xmath79 is extracted principally from the nasa tables . [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,<,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "the orbital parameters have been determined for an object traveling in a gravitational field .",
    "two scalar quantities are necessary , @xmath0 and @xmath80 . the first one , @xmath0 defines the gravitational potential , being that depending on the rate @xmath81 .",
    "it does nt represent simply the distance between the orbiting object and the gravity center , it is the sum of the same real distance plus the distance at the time when @xmath0 was null .",
    "that distance is virtual , in that sense it locates a precise instant but not an unique spatial point .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath82 , is the momentum value relative to the orbiting body .",
    "the applied formulae have been previously and more generally determined considering the intensity variation of an electromagnetic field , depending on the dynamic distance between the source and the observation point . in any case they have been derived from geometrical analysis of the physical environment , considering the space euclidean and the time linear . in the present article ,",
    "the simple case of a fixed center of mass has been treated .",
