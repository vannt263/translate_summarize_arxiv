    "the observation of a rather distinctive pattern of neutrino mixing , together with the available information on neutrino mass splitting , has triggered numerous theoretical proposals going beyond the standard electroweak model ( sm ) .",
    "seesaw models enjoy a fair share of these , along with additional assumptions to suit particular textures of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "type - ii seesaw models can generate majorana neutrino masses without any right - handed neutrino(s ) , with the help of one or more y=2 scalar triplets .",
    "the restriction of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of such a triplet , arising from the limits on the @xmath4-parameter ( with @xmath5 ) , is obeyed in a not so unnatural manner , where the constitution of the scalar potential can accommodate large triplet scalar masses vis - a - vis a small vev .",
    "in fact , this very feature earns such models classification as a type of ` seesaw ' .",
    "a lot of work has been done on the phenomenology of scalar triplets which , interestingly , also arise in left - right symmetric theories  @xcite .",
    "one can , however , still ask the question : is a single - triplet scenario self - sufficient , or does the replication of triplets ( together with , say , the single scalar doublet of the sm ) bring about any difference in phenomenology ?",
    "this question , otherwise a purely academic one , acquires special meaning in the context of some neutrino mass models which aim to connect the mass ordering with the values of the mixing angles , thereby achieving some additional predictiveness .",
    "one class of such models depend on texture zeros , where a number of zero entries ( usually restricted to two ) in the mass matrix enable one to establish the desired connection .",
    "the existence of such zero entries require the imposition of some additional symmetry ; it has , for example , been shown that a horizontal @xmath6 symmetry can serve the purpose .",
    "the simultaneous requirement of zero textures and the type - ii seesaw mechanism , however , turns out to be inconsistent , as has been discussed in earlier works  @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency is gone for two triplets .",
    "this resurrects the relevance of the phenomenology of two - triplet , one doublet scalar sectors , this time with practical implications .",
    "we have studied such phenomenology in reference  @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of this study was that , whereas the doubly charged scalar in the single triplet scenario would decay mostly in the @xmath7 or @xmath8 modes , the decay channel @xmath9 acquires primacy over a large region of the parameter space .",
    "some predictions on this in the context of the large hadron collider were also shown in reference  @xcite .",
    "however , an added possibility with two triplet is the possibility of at least one cp - violating phase being there .",
    "this in principle can affect the phenomenology of the model , which is worth studying .    with this in view",
    ", we have analyzed here the one - doublet , two - triplet framework , including cp - violating effects arising via a relative phase between the triplets .",
    "thus , the vev of one triplet has been made complex and consequently , the coefficient of the corresponding trilinear term in the scalar potential has also been rendered complex .",
    "indeed , the introduction of a phase results in some interesting findings that were not present when the relative phase was absent .",
    "first of all , as a result of mixing between two triplets and presence of a relative phase between them , something on which no phenomenological restrictions exits , the heavier doubly charged scalar can now decay frequently into the lighter doubly charged scalar plus the sm - like higgs boson , i.e @xmath1 , over a larger range of parameter space .",
    "this can give rise to a spectacular signal in the context of lhc .",
    "basically , as a final state , we obtain @xmath10 i.e a doubly charged scalar decaying into two same - sign leptons plus the sm - like higgs .",
    "this decay often dominates over all other decay channels .",
    "when this decay is not present due to insufficient mass - difference between respective scalars , the decay @xmath11 mostly dominates , and its consequence was discussed in some detail in our earlier work  @xcite on the cp - conserving scenario .    secondly , for some combination of parameters , the decays mentioned in the above paragraph are not possible with a vanishing or small phase , due to insufficient gap in masses between the respective scalars . however ,",
    "if we continuously increase the value of the phase , keeping all the other parameters fixed , the mass difference between the scalars start in increase , so that the aforementioned channel finally opens up .",
    "thirdly , we have noticed in  @xcite that the gauge coupling dominated decay @xmath12 dominates over the yukawa coupling dominated decay @xmath13 , even in those region of parameter space where we have chosen the yukawa coupling matrices to be sufficiently large ( @xmath14 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the cp - violating phase suppresses the neutrino mass matrix elements for the same value of the triplet vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "this in turn requires an increase in the corresponding yukawa coupling matrix elements , since the vev s and yukawa couplings are related by the expression for neutrino masses .",
    "the outcome of this whole process is that , for several bps , the decay @xmath15 competes with the decay into @xmath16 .    finally , the cp - conserving scenario marks out regions of the parameter space , where the branching ratios of the decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 are of comparable , though subdominant , rates . as the phase picks up , the same vev causes necessitates a hike in yukawa coupling , as discussed above . in such situations ,",
    "the decay @xmath15 mostly dominates over the @xmath19 mode .",
    "we present a summary of the scenario with a single triplet with complex vev on section  2 . in section  3 ,",
    "we outline the two - triplet scenario with a complex phase , including the corresponding scalar potential . the composition of physical states , the benchmark points for our numerical study and the results are presented in section  4 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section  5 .",
    "we first give the reader a glimpse of the scenario with a single triplet @xmath20 , over and above the usual higgs doublet @xmath21 , using the notation of  @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is equivalently denoted by the @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 the vev s of the doublet and the triplet are expressed as @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the only doublet - dominated physical state that survives after the generation of gauge boson masses is a neutral scalar @xmath26 .    the most general scalar potential including @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "all parameters in the higgs potential are real except @xmath29 which is complex in general . by performing a global @xmath30 transformation ,",
    "@xmath31 can always be chosen real and positive . because of the @xmath29-term in the potential there is no second global symmetry to make @xmath32 real .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 can also be complex and , therefore , it can be written as @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential with respect to the phase of @xmath32 i.e @xmath36 , gives the relation between the phases as @xmath37 .",
    "the choice @xmath38 , @xmath39 ensures that the dominant source of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the scalar doublet .",
    "it is further assumed , following  @xcite , that @xmath40 sufficiently small , as required by the @xmath4-parameter constraint , * to keep doublet - triplet mixing low in general , and * to ensure that all quartic couplings are perturbative .",
    "the mass terms for the singly - charged scalars can be expressed in a compact form as @xmath41 with @xmath42 keeping aside the charged goldstone boson , the mass - squared of the singly - charged physical scalar is obtained as @xmath43 while the doubly - charged scalar mass is expressed as @xmath44 thus , in the limit @xmath45 , @xmath46    thus a substantial mass splitting between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is in general difficult .",
    "this tends to disfavour the @xmath49 decay channel of @xmath47 , as compared to @xmath50 and @xmath19 .",
    "strong evidence has accumulated in favour of neutrino oscillation from the solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments over the last few years .",
    "it is now widely believed that neutrinos have non - degenerate masses and a very characteristic mixing pattern .",
    "a lot , however , is yet to be known , including the mass generation mechanism and the absolute values of the masses , as opposed to mass - squared differences which affect oscillation rates .",
    "also , a lot of effort is on to ascertain the nature of neutrino mass hierarchy , including the signs of the mass - squared differences .",
    "a gateway to information of the above kinds is the light neutrino mass matrix , in a basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal .    here ,",
    "too , in the absence of very clear guidelines , various ` textures ' for the neutrino mass matrix are often investigated .",
    "a possibility that frequently enters into such investigations is one where the mass matrix has some zero entries , perhaps as the consequence of some built - in symmetry of lepton flavours . at the same time , such ` zero textures ' lead to a higher degree of predictiveness and inter - relation between mass eigenvalues and mixing angles , by virtue of having fewer free paramaters , see for example  @xcite . in the context of majorana neutrinos which have a symmetric mass matrix ,",
    "various texture zeros have thus been studied from a number of angles . of them , two - zero textures have a rather wide acceptability .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that none of the seven possible two - zero - texture cases can be achieved by assuming only one scalar triplet .",
    "however , this is not the case with two triplets , where several of the seven possible two - zero textures are allowed .",
    "therefore , it is important to examine the phenomenological consequences of an augmented triplet sector , if type - ii seesaw has to be consistent with the texture - zero approach .    ",
    "one is thus encouraged to consider a scenario consisting of one complex doublet and two @xmath51 triplet scalars @xmath52 , @xmath53 , both written as 2@xmath542 matrices : @xmath55 the vev s of the scalar triplets are given by @xmath56 the vev of the higgs doublet is as usual given by equation  ( [ vev ] ) .",
    "the scalar potential in this model involving @xmath21 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be written as @xmath57 where summation over @xmath58 is understood .",
    "this potential is not the most general one , since we neglected some of the quartic terms .",
    "this is justified in view of the scope of this paper , as laid out in the introduction .    in  @xcite ,",
    "all the vev s as well the parameters in the potential were assumed to be real . as has already ben mentioned , this need not be the situation in general . to see the phenomenology including cp - violation , we make a minimal extension of the simplified scenario by postulating _",
    "one _ cp - violating phase to exist .",
    "this entails a complex vev for any one triplet ( in our case we have chosen it to be @xmath52 ) . at the same time",
    ", there is a complex phase in the coefficient @xmath59 of the trilinear term in the potential .",
    "thus one can write @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    using considerations very similar to those for the single - triplet model , we have taken @xmath62 , keeping in mind the constraint on the @xmath4-parameter .",
    "the mass eigenvalues , scalar mixing matrices etc.following from the potential  ( [ pot ] ) can only be obtained numerically in general .",
    "however , one can use the smallness of the triplet vev s @xmath63 , and drop the quartic terms in the scalar triplets during the diagonalisation of the mass matrices .",
    "this enables one to use approximate analytical expressions , which makes our broad conclusions somewhat transparent .",
    "however , the numerical results presented in section  [ results1 ] are obtained using the full potential  ( [ pot ] ) , including the effects of the triplet vev s .",
    "it is convenient to speak in terms of the following matrices and vectors :    @xmath64    @xmath65    in terms of them , the conditions for a stationary point of the potential are @xmath66 using the notation @xmath67 .",
    "these three equations are exact if one neglects all terms quartic in the triplet vev s in @xmath68 . in equation  ( [ vev2 ] )",
    "we have already divided by @xmath31 , assuming @xmath69 .",
    "the small vev s @xmath63 are thereafter obtained as @xmath70 and from equation  ( [ vev3 ] ) the phase of @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath71 this re - iterates the fact that the phases @xmath59 and @xmath72 are related to each other .",
    "it is also evident from  ( [ phase1 ] ) that the value of the angle @xmath73 has to be @xmath74 where @xmath75 when the phase @xmath76 is absent .",
    "we next discuss the mass matrices of charged scalars .",
    "the mass matrix of the doubly - charged scalars is obtained as @xmath77 it is interesting to note that if we drop those quartic terms for simplification from our scalar potential , then our doubly charged mass matrix remains the same as in  @xcite .",
    "this gives the impression that the relative phase between triplets does not affect the doubly charged mass matrix if we drop the quartic terms in the potential .",
    "but in our numerical calculation , where we have taken the full scalar potential including the quartic terms , we find such a dependence , arising obviously from the quartic terms .",
    "this will be discussed further in the next section .    as for the singly - charged fields @xmath78 ,",
    "one has consider their mixing with @xmath79 of the higgs doublet . and",
    "this introduces the cp - violating phase into the singly charged mass matrix .",
    "we write the mass term as @xmath80 equation  ( [ pot ] ) leads to @xmath81 now , this mass matrix must have a zero eigenvalue , corresponding to the would - be - goldstone boson . indeed , on substituting the minimization equations  ( [ vev1 ] ) , ( [ vev2 ] ) and  ( [ vev3 ] ) , we see that @xmath82 which ensures a consistency check .",
    "the mass matrices  ( [ m++ ] ) and  ( [ m+ ] ) are diagonalized by @xmath83 respectively , with @xmath84 we have denoted the fields with definite mass by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the charged would - be - goldstone boson .",
    "we also outline the neutral sector of the model , which can not now be separated into cp - even and cp - odd sectors .",
    "thus the mass matrix for the neutral sector of the present scenario turns out to be a @xmath88 matrix , including mixing between real and imaginary parts of the complex neutral fields . the symmetric neutral mass matrix is denoted by @xmath89 , whose elements are listed in the appendix .",
    "so , the mass term for the neutral part can be written as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 s are the neutral states in flavor basis .",
    "this mass matrix is diagonalized by @xmath92 with @xmath93 where @xmath26 is identified with the standard model higgs boson and @xmath94 is the neutral goldstone boson .",
    "it is interesting to note that once we remove the phases of coefficient of trilinear term in scalar potential and the vev of triplet @xmath95 by setting @xmath96 , then the mixing between the cp - even and cp - odd scalars vanishes and we get back the usual separate @xmath97 matrices for these two sectors .",
    "this also serves as a consistency check for the model . and",
    "ofcourse the lightest neutral scalar of this sector can be identified with sm higgs .",
    "the @xmath98 yukawa interactions of the triplets are @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the charge conjugation matrix , the @xmath101 are the symmetric yukawa coupling matrices of the triplets @xmath102 , and the @xmath103 are the summation indices over the three neutrino flavours .",
    "the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal in this basis .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is generated from @xmath104 as @xmath105 this relates the yukawa coupling constants @xmath106 , @xmath107 and the real part of the triplet vev s , namely , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenvalues are fixed according to a particular type of mass spectrum . in this work",
    "we illustrate our points , without any loss of generality , in the context of normal hierarchy , setting the lowest neutrino mass eigenvalue to zero .",
    "next , using the observed central values of the various lepton mixing angles , the elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath110 can be found by using @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the pmns matrix given by  @xcite @xmath113 and @xmath114 is the diagonal matrix of the neutrino masses . we have neglected possible majorana phases , and the recent global analysis of neutrino data are used to compute the elements of @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "also , the phase @xmath115 has been set to zero . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the results from the daya bay and reno experiments  @xcite have been used .",
    "after all this , all terms of the left - hand side of equation  ( [ ll ] ) are approximately known , which is sufficient for predicting phenomenology in the 100 gev - 1 tev scale .. the actual mass matrix thus constructed , on numerical evaluation , approximately reflects a two - zero texture which is one of the motivations of this study .    for each benchmark point used in the next section , @xmath72 and @xmath109 get determined by values of the other parameters in the scalar potential . of course , the coupling matrices @xmath117 and @xmath118 are still indeterminate .",
    "we fix the matrix @xmath118 by choosing a single suitable value for all elements of the @xmath119@xmath120 block and a smaller value for the rest of the matrix .",
    "as has already been mentioned in  @xcite , our broad conclusions do not depend on this ` working rule ' .",
    "the trademark signal of higgs triplets is contained in the doubly charged components . in the current scenario , too , one would like to see the signatures of the two doubly charged scalars , especially the heavier one , namely @xmath121 whose decays have already been shown to contain a rather rich phenomenology .",
    "the @xmath121 , produced at the lhc via the drell - yan process , can in general have two - body decays in the following channels :    @xmath122    with @xmath26 is the sm - like higgs and @xmath123 .",
    "the decay modes ( [ h50])and  ( [ hhw ] ) are absent in the single - triplet model . on the other hand , mixing between two triplets opens up situations where the mass separation between @xmath124 and @xmath125 is sufficient to kinematically allow the transitions  ( [ h50 ] ) and  ( [ hhw ] ) .",
    "the decay  ( [ h50 ] ) opens up a spectacular signal , especially when @xmath126 mostly decays into two same sign leptons , leading to @xmath127 let us denote the mass of sm higgs by @xmath128 , that of @xmath129 by @xmath130 and that of @xmath131 by @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "then , in the convention @xmath134 , @xmath135 , the decays  ( [ h50])and  ( [ hhw ] ) are possible only if @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that this can naturally happen , by considering three distinct regions of the parameter space and selecting four benchmark points ( bps ) for each region .",
    "the relative phase between two triplets also a plays an important roll in these cases . in order to emphasise this ,",
    "we have also chosen three different values of the phase , namely @xmath138 and @xmath139 for each benchmark point .",
    "thus we have considered 36 bps alltogether , comprising three distinct regions of the parameter space and relative phases between triplets to justify our findings .",
    "we have seen that , in a single - triplet model , the doubly - charged higgs decays into either @xmath140 or @xmath141 .",
    "the former is controlled by the @xmath142 yukawa couplings @xmath143 , while the latter is driven by @xmath144 , the triplet vev .",
    "neutrino masses are given by  ( [ numas ] ) , implying large values of @xmath143 for small @xmath144 , and vice versa .",
    "interestingly , the presence of triplet phase through the @xmath145 term in this equation actually suppresses the vev @xmath72 of the first triplet .",
    "this in turn implies that we get higher values for yukawa coupling matrix entries @xmath146 compared to the case where cp - violating effects are absent .",
    "accordingly , we have identified , for the chosen values of triplet phase , three regions in the parameter space , corresponding to    1 .",
    "@xmath147 , 2 .",
    "@xmath148 , 3 .",
    "@xmath149 .",
    "these are referred to as scenarios 1 , 2 and 3 respectively in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the masses of the various physical state scalars are shown in tables .",
    "although our study involves mainly the phenomenology of charged scalars , we have also listed the masses of neutral scalars .",
    "it should be noted that the lightest neutral scalar , dominated by the doublet component , has mass @xmath150 gev for each bp , identifying it with the observed higgs particle .",
    "one also notices a rather interesting effect of the triplet phase , shown in figures  ( [ fig : fig_f ] ) and  ( [ fig : fig_g ] ) . in figure  ( [ fig : fig_f ] ) we have plotted the variation of mass difference between @xmath95 and @xmath151 with respect to variation of the phase @xmath73 .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath95 and @xmath152 is similarly presented in figure  ( [ fig : fig_g ] ) . if the mass differences do not allow the decays  ( [ h50 ] ) and  ( [ hhw ] ) for @xmath153 , they open up with increase in the phase of the triplet , when all other parameters are at fixed values .    earlier , we neglected contributions from the quartic terms in our scalar potential in the approximate forms of the doubly - and singly - charged mass matrices .",
    "however , the import of the phase is not properly captured unless one retains these terms .",
    "thus it is only via a full numerical analysis of the potential retaining all terms that the above effect of the phase of the trilinear term becomes apparent .",
    "it should also be noted that the cosine of the complex phase suppresses the contribution to neutrino masses .",
    "consequently , for the same triplet vev , one requires larger values of the yukawa interaction strengths .",
    "this makes the @xmath154 decay mode of a doubly charged scalar more competitive with @xmath155 , as compared to the results in  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the branching ratios for a given scalar in different channels are of course dependent on the various parameters that characterise a bp .",
    "we list all the charged scalar masses in tables  [ charged1 ] , [ charged2 ] and  [ charged3 ] .",
    "moreover , the neutral scalar masses are shown in tables  [ neutral1 ] , [ neutral2 ] and  [ neutral3 ] for three different values of triplet phase @xmath73 .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath121 and @xmath126 for different triplet phases are listed in tables  [ branching1],[branching2 ] and  [ branching3 ] , together with their pair - production cross sections at the lhc with @xmath156tev .",
    "the cross sections and branching ratios have been calculated with the help of the package feynrules ( version 1.6.0 ) @xcite , thus creating a new ufo model file in madgraph5-amc@nlo ( version 2.3.3 )  @xcite .",
    "using the full machinery of scalar mixing in this model , the decay widths into various channels have been obtained .",
    "the presence of the phase @xmath73 also affects phenomenology in the following way .",
    "suppose , in the absence of any additional symmetry in hierarchy , the matrices @xmath157 and @xmath158 are such that the resulting elements of each charged mass matrix are of similar order .",
    "this would normally result in rather low mass - splitting between @xmath95 and @xmath151 , so long as the cp - violating phase is vanishing or small . for large @xmath73",
    ", however , the degree of doublet - triplet mixing will be different for the two triplets .",
    "the splitting between @xmath95 and @xmath151 consequently goes up and the decay @xmath1 tends to dominate .",
    "drell - yan pair production of @xmath159 is @xmath160 , i.e an invariant mass peakin same - sign dileptons , together with an sm - like higgs , that can be identified in the usual search channels at the lhc .    from tables",
    "[ branching1 ] , [ branching2 ] and  [ branching3 ] , we see that decay  ( [ hll2 ] ) dominates , when the masses of @xmath95 and @xmath151 are sufficiently separated .",
    "also , when the phase space needed for this decay  ( [ hll2 ] ) is not available , the process  ( [ hhw ] ) dominates over all other remaining decays .",
    "benchmark points when decay  ( [ hhw ] ) mostly dominates for @xmath161 have been discussed in detail in reference  @xcite . here",
    "we supplement those observations with some results for the case when decay  ( [ hll2 ] ) has an interesting consequence , as exemplitied by figures  2 and  3 .",
    "figure  2 specifically shows the effect of cp - violating phase going up .",
    "we have seen in figure  1 that the mass difference between @xmath95 and @xmath151 undergoes significant enhancement if , with other parameters unchanged , once the phase @xmath73 is increased beyond @xmath139 , the decay @xmath1 not only opens up but also becomes dominant .",
    "this point is accumulated in figure  2 , for which the choice of parameters is detailed in the caption .",
    "we simulated the same - sign dilepton final states and notice that there are two invariant mass peaks for @xmath162 in bp 4 of scenario 2 , as shown in figure  ( [ fig : fig_h ] ) .",

    "<S> we consider a scenario where , along with the usual higgs doublet , two scalar triplets are present . </S>",
