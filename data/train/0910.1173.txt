    "how is it possible to define _ and _ to detect large variations or fluctuations of a sequence ( with possible applications to the [ discrete ] time evolution of biological , financial , musical phenomena and so on ) .",
    "the usual approach is based on computing the distance of the associated _ piecewise affine function _ to the corresponding linear regression line , i.e. , on computing the _",
    "residual variance_. but this quantity somehow describes total distance to `` regularity '' , and says nothing about possibly large local fluctuations : for example , it may not discriminate between an exponentially growing function and a fractal - like `` chaotic '' ( disordered ) curve .",
    "in particular one should remember that dictionaries defining `` fluctuation '' use words with a similar meaning among which `` wavering '' , `` unsteadiness '' , `` vacillation '' , `` erraticness '' , `` variability '' , etc .",
    "we suggest here to bring to light  especially for applications to sequences  a paper of crofton dated 1868 @xcite ( see also the papers of cauchy @xcite and the papers of steinhaus @xcite and of dupain , kamae and mends france @xcite ) .",
    "crofton studies the average number of intersection points of a curve with random straight lines .",
    "but this average number can be thought of as a measure of the fluctuations of the curve .",
    "namely , for a straight line or a curve `` looking like a straight line '' , this average number is equal to @xmath0 , while it has a very large value for a `` very complicated '' curve .",
    "following this idea , we propose a measure of large variations of a sequence and we compare it with the residual variance .",
    "conversely , this measure will allow us to _ decide _ whether a sequence is `` more complicated '' than another in cases where the visual aspect does not suffice to suggest an intuitive answer .",
    "we will also show that this measure can be applied to _",
    "infinite sequences _ satisfying some technical condition ( in particular certain _ automatic sequences _ as well as _ sturmian sequences _ ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) to describe their `` complexity '' .",
    "as will be recalled , the ideas of cauchy and crofton were already used in various contexts : one of our purposes is _ to insist on their usefulness for measuring the complexity of discrete phenomena _ , as a compromise between measuring intensity , time and consecutive repetitions .",
    "these ideas will be applied in a subsequent paper ( see @xcite ) to fluctuations of biological parameters , e.g. , the weight , or the _ quetelet index _ for children ( see p. 5253 , and",
    "p. 61 ) , while the `` simplified '' definition of the bmi is the ratio of the weight by the height squared .",
    "] , often called the _",
    "( body mass index ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) for children : are `` large fluctuations '' of the bmi risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in relation with the _ metabolic syndrome _ ?",
    "this question was addressed with other tools in @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",
    "we also aim to try to apply this measure of fluctuations to other questions , e.g. , analyzing fluctuations of the stockmarket , and quantifying the `` smoothness '' of musical themes .",
    "a possible approach for describing large variations or large fluctuations of a curve is to `` compare '' it with a straight line .",
    "more precisely we can count the number of intersection points of random straight lines with the given curve : if this number is small on average , the curve behaves roughly as a straight line ; if this number is large , the curve is `` complicated '' .",
    "is there an `` easy '' way to compute this number ?",
    "the cauchy - crofton theorem answers the question .",
    "consider a plane curve @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the length of @xmath1 and let @xmath3 denote the perimeter of the closed curve forming the edge of the convex hull of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of straight lines which intersect @xmath1 .",
    "any line can be defined as the set of @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 belongs to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a positive real number .",
    "a straight line is therefore completely determined by @xmath10 . letting @xmath11 denote the lebesgue measure on the set @xmath12 , the _ average _ number of intersection points between the curve @xmath1 and a line in @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 the following result can be found in @xcite ; see also the papers of cauchy @xcite .",
    "[ crofton ] the average number of intersection points between the curve @xmath1 and the straight lines in @xmath13 satisfies @xmath15    in his paper , crofton speaks of `` local or geometrical probability '' ; he writes about probabilities , `` the rigorous precision , as well as the extreme beauty of the methods and results ... the subtlety and delicacy of the reasoning ... '' , and he quotes laplace : `` ce calcul dlicat '' .",
    "crofton s result is explained in steinhaus paper @xcite .",
    "it is presented in an illuminating way with several examples in the paper of dupain , kamae , and mends france @xcite : these authors studied the notion of _ entropy of a curve _ and of _ temperature of a curve _ introduced by mends france in @xcite .",
    "note that the occurrence of the number @xmath16 in the numerator can be understood by considering the case where @xmath1 is a segment : the average number of intersection points is equal to @xmath0 , while the perimeter of the convex hull of the segment is twice the length of the segment ( why twice ?",
    "go back to the definition [ `` closed curve ... '' ] or think of the case where the segment is replaced by a thin rectangle whose width tends to zero ) .",
    "the reader will have noted that crofton s approach has much to do with the famous buffon needle problem @xcite also known as the buffon - laplace needle problem ; see @xcite .",
    "the area of this type of result is known as `` integral geometry '' .",
    "this terminology seems to have been introduced by blaschke in his `` vorlesungen ber integralgeometrie '' @xcite .",
    "more recent references are the book of santal @xcite , and the forthcoming book of langevin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting review of the books of blaschke and of the 1936 edition of the book of santal is @xcite .",
    "a nice exposition of the ( proof of the ) theorem of cauchy - crofton , where the curve is only supposed to be rectifiable , can be found in the paper of ayari and dubuc @xcite .",
    "we also recommend for a first approach the texts of mends france @xcite and of teissier @xcite .",
    "note that the crofton theorem is also ( and more correctly ) called the cauchy - crofton theorem in the literature .    using the theorem of cauchy - crofton to define a measure of complexity of a curve",
    "was first suggested by mends france @xcite ; also see @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed later , e.g. , in @xcite where the name `` folding index '' is used .",
    "also note that the crofton formulas in @xcite are used frequently in many fields .",
    "these include complex motor behaviour in human movements @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , study of human blood and transfusion @xcite , simulation of gravitational evolution @xcite , anisotropies of the secondary cosmic microwave background @xcite , grain size distribution analysis for polycrystalline thin films @xcite , image analysis of crystalline agglomerates @xcite , measurement of convolution in cotton fibers @xcite , all applications of lis ( line - intercept sampling ) , e.g. , to the statistical analysis of vegetation or wildlife , see for example @xcite and the references therein ( in particular @xcite in the references below ) , spatial analysis of urban maps @xcite , in a discussion about examples of information processing coming from neurophysiology , cognitive psychology , and perception @xcite , and even relations between art and complexity @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the theorem of cauchy - crofton suggests the following definition .",
    "let @xmath1 be a plane curve of length @xmath2 and such that the perimeter of its convex hull is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the _ inconstancy _ of the curve @xmath1 , denoted @xmath17 , is defined by @xmath18    the above definition and the cauchy - crofton theorem show that the inconstancy of the union of two curves is at most the sum of the inconstancies of these curves , that the inconstancy of a curve is equal to the inconstancy of its translated , rotated or homothetic curve , etc .",
    "other criteria for measuring fluctuations of a discrete curve can be found in the literature for real ( e.g. , biological ) phenomena : qualitative classification with predetermined cut - off points , maximal values , residual variance , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite for weight fluctuations ) . by oversimplifying most of the various definitions",
    ", one could say that they aim to measure the `` distance '' between the considered curve and a straight line , but this distance can be computed globally or locally .",
    "we recall the definition of _ regression line _ , of _ residual variance _ , and of _ mean square error_.    [ def ] let @xmath19 be a family of @xmath20 points .",
    "their _ regression line _ is the straight line that minimizes the sum of squares of distances from the @xmath21 s to it . letting @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the averages of the @xmath24 s and of the @xmath25 s , the equation of the regression line is @xmath26 the _ mse _",
    "( i.e. , _ mean square error _ ) and the _ rmse _ ( i.e. , _ root mean square error _ ) of the @xmath21 s are defined by @xmath27 the mean square error is sometimes called _",
    "residual variance_.    we also introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath28 be a positive integer .",
    "we define @xmath29 to be the union of the @xmath28 segments @xmath30@xmath31 , @xmath31@xmath32 , @xmath33 @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "( note that we have @xmath36 points , and that , without loss of generality , we suppose that the curve begins at the origin . )      in this section we show two curves having same length : one is `` fluctuating '' , the other increases quickly , but their residual variances are both equal to @xmath37 ; see figure  [ same - mse ] .",
    "note that when we say that the first curve is more `` fluctuating '' than the second one , it means for example that for a variation of weight or of bmi , the first curve is really fluctuating , while the second one just shows some ( possibly quick ) growth ( also see remarks  [ growth ] and the beginning of section  [ nonintuitive ] below ) .",
    "are residual variance and inconstancy of a curve comparable ?",
    "we will prove that this is not the case , even for very simple curves , thanks to two easy lemmas .",
    "[ res ] let @xmath38 be the residual variance of the curve @xmath39 . then @xmath40    the computation is straightforward .",
    "the linear regression straight line is parallel to @xmath30@xmath32 , and it contains the center of gravity of the triangle @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . or simply compute from definition  [ def ] : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , hence @xmath45 .    [ inc ] let @xmath39 be the curve defined as the union of the two straight line segments @xmath30@xmath31 and @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "then , @xmath46 , the inconstancy of @xmath39 , is given by @xmath47    the proof is again straightforward .",
    "the length of @xmath39 and the perimeter of the convex hull of @xmath39 are given respectively by @xmath48    we can now state the non - comparability of residual variance and inconstancy .    [",
    "compare ] residual variance and inconstancy of a curve are not comparable .",
    "more precisely , there exist four curves @xmath49 , @xmath50 , ( see figure  [ proposition ] and the proof below ) such that , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are their residual variances and inconstancies , then the following inequalities hold : @xmath53    using lemmas  [ res ] and [ inc ] above , we get the residual variances @xmath51 and inconstancies @xmath52 of the following curves @xmath49 @xmath54    [ growth ] comparing @xmath55 and @xmath56 shows again that `` fluctuating '' is not the same as `` growing '' . more generally , with the notation of lemma  [ inc ] above , looking at @xmath57 , shows that @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath59 varies from @xmath60 to @xmath61 the quantity @xmath57 increases from @xmath0 to a small value @xmath62 then it decreases back to @xmath0 .",
    "there are other quantities that also `` measure '' the fluctuations of a curve .",
    "for example , keeping the notations of definition  [ def ] : the _ total variation _ is defined as the mean of @xmath63 , i.e. , as @xmath64 ; the _ maximal distance _ is defined as @xmath65 .",
    "the reader can easily compute these quantities for the curve @xmath39 and check that they are not comparable to the inconstancy of @xmath39 .",
    "total variation : @xmath66   maximal distance : @xmath67",
    "taking again the example in the previous section of a curve consisting of two straight line segments , let us vary the value @xmath68 , say @xmath69 , and fix @xmath70 ( see figure  [ 3varyingpoints ] ) .",
    "the inconstancy @xmath71 is thus given by @xmath72 this map @xmath73 is increasing for @xmath74 , which is in agreement with what a `` fluctuation '' should be .",
    "it is clear that @xmath75 , which shows that the line @xmath76 is a symmetry axis . in other words , `` exchanging '' the two segments , more precisely replacing ( @xmath30@xmath77 ) , ( @xmath77@xmath78 ) by ( @xmath30@xmath79 ) , ( @xmath79@xmath78 ) , does not change the inconstancy ( see figure  [ symmetry ] ) .",
    "of course this is a necessary condition for a fluctuation criterion .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath80 ( no fluctuation ) and @xmath81 ( when @xmath59 is large , the value of @xmath59 is not really important , the inconstancy is close to @xmath16 ) .",
    "we also have that @xmath82 if and only if @xmath76 .",
    "in particular the graph of the function @xmath71 has the aspect shown in figures  [ inconstancygraph ] and [ varying - a ] .",
    "we note that the curve is `` flat '' in the neighborhood of @xmath83 , or even for @xmath84 ; see figure  [ inconstancygraph ] .",
    "this means that the inconstancy @xmath85 , which is equal to @xmath0 for @xmath86 , remains close to @xmath0 when the two slopes of the curve have the same sign , while it is larger when the signs of the slopes are opposite , which correctly describes what a fluctuation should be ( the mse does not have this property ) ; see figure  [ slopes ] .",
    "also the inconstancy @xmath85 tends quickly to @xmath16 when @xmath87 is small : see figure  [ varying - a ] .",
    "if we look more generally at the inconstancy of @xmath29 , what will clearly matter for its size is the sequence of slopes : growth and signs of consecutive terms are crucial characteristics of the sequence , which corresponds to the intuitive idea of `` fluctuation '' .",
    "of course we always have the straightforward bounds @xmath88 ( count the possible number of intersection points of @xmath29 with a random straight line and apply theorem  [ crofton ] ) .    conversely the inconstancy may be used to discriminate between curves , i.e. , to decide whether a curve fluctuates more than another , when the `` visual aspect '' does not suffice to assert an intuitive answer .",
    "we give two examples .      in figure  [ deciding ] inconstancies permit to discriminate between `` less fluctuating '' and `` more fluctuating '' curves , though there is no visual evidence of which curve fluctuates more .",
    "it is interesting to note that the maximum of the function is not really taken into account , only the variations count ( look , e.g. , at the two examples with inconstancy @xmath89 in figure  [ deciding ] ) .",
    "the lengths and inconstancies of the two curves @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( see figure  [ sameinco ] ) are the same .",
    "inconstancy of ( finite or infinite ) sequences can be defined in a straightforward way from what precedes .",

    "several algorithms are available , their complexity is in @xmath230 ( see , e.g. , the graham scan studied in @xcite , the jarvis march studied in @xcite ; see also , e.g. , the papers @xcite in particular @xcite gives an optimal real - time algorithm for planar convex hulls ) .    implementations of these algorithms are classical in usual softwares : for example the command convhull in maple ( with the package convex ) , the command convexhull in mathematica , the command convex@xmath231hull in scilab , or the command convhull ( see also convhulln ) in matlab . also note that qhull computes convex hulls , delaunay triangulations , voronoi diagrams , halfspace intersections about a point , furthest - site delaunay triangulations , and furthest - site voronoi diagrams ( see http://www.qhull.org/ ) .",
    "demonstrations of computations can be found on several sites ; see e.g. ,    http://www.piler.com/convexhull/    http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos226/demo/ah/grahamscan.html    http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall08/cos226/demo/ah/convexhull.html    http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/@xmath232lambert/java/3d/hull.html",
    "inspired by the theorem of cauchy - crofton , the inconstancy of a curve could be a way of detecting large fluctuations of a curve , different from ( and hopefully better than ) usual indexes such as the residual variance .",
    "we intend to test this idea in three domains : fluctuations of biological parameters @xcite , fluctuations of the stockmarket @xcite and smoothness of musical themes @xcite .",
    "two other directions could be the following .",
    "first , a way of discriminating between models that describe a given phenomenon with the same error bound ( e.g. , prediction of electric load and consumption ) could be to choose the model for which the difference between data and predictions has maximal inconstancy ( when the inconstancy is close to @xmath0 , this difference is `` quasi - affine '' ; this means that there is a `` quasi - affine '' bias in the model that can / should be corrected _ a priori _ ) .",
    "second , we alluded to fractal - like `` chaotic '' ( disordered ) curves in the introduction ; coming across , e.g. , the paper @xcite we recall that measuring the `` complexity '' of geographic objects classically involves their fractal dimension and , e.g. , their `` length '' ; we could also think of looking at their inconstancy ( typically how complicated a river can be , i.e. , how far from straight it looks , can be measured by the number of intersection points with a random straight line ) .",
    "a natural question then occurs : to what extent fractal dimension and inconstancy are related ? or what can be said of the intersection with straight lines of a set with given fractal dimension ?",
    "such questions also make sense for ( in)finite sequences , in particular in view of remark  [ folding ] .",
    "of course the length of such curves is usually infinite while the length of the convex hull is finite ( think of the von koch curve ) .",
    "what could be looked at for fractals obtained by `` iteration '' is the inconstancy at each finite step of the iteration : it is conceivable that the fractal dimension shows up , though this is not the case for the von koch curve .",
    "some ideas about these questions can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , in particular in relation with the _ entropy _ of a curve , as discussed in several papers of mends france .",
    "we will conclude this paper with that notion of _ entropy _ for a plane curve .",
    "let @xmath233 be the probability that a straight line cuts the plane curve @xmath1 in exactly @xmath28 points , then the theorem of cauchy - crofton says that @xmath234 it is natural to define the _ entropy _ of @xmath1 by @xmath235 now how large can this expression be ?",
    "define the set of sequences @xmath236 by @xmath237 it can be proven ( see @xcite for details , also see @xcite ) that @xmath238 where @xmath239 ( the quantity @xmath107 can be seen as the inverse of the _ temperature _ of the curve ) .    a modified definition is thus proposed in @xcite , namely @xmath240 this definition was used in several papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . with our terminology , it reads , as noted by mends france , `` the entropy is the logarithm of the inconstancy '' .",
    "the reader might think of comparing this statement with the classical weber - fechner law in psychophysics according to which `` sensation is proportional to the logarithm of excitation '' ( @xcite ; see also http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/fechner/ ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank several readers of this preprint , in particular the referees and p. duchet .",
    "they also wish to thank very warmly m. mends france for interesting discussions and for several suggestions after he read a previous version of the paper .",
