    "with a lack of deeper understanding of strong interactions , search for signal events in hadron collisions is somewhat ambiguous due to the uncertainties in the prediction of the cross section of background processes . in case of large number of background events the theoretical uncertainties in qcd predictions can result in swamping the signal .",
    "thus at hadron colliders among various channels of the same signal significance the most favorable are those with large signal - to - background ratio .",
    "in this paper we study the lhc prospects in searches for standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , radion and sgoldstino in @xmath0 channel . in comparison with inclusive @xmath1 channel , which has almost the same signal significance , @xmath0 channel exhibits larger signal - to - background ratio and , consequently , stronger possibility to have control over qcd background . though the signal cross section is smaller in the channel with a high energy jet than in the inclusive channel , rich 3-body kinematics in the final state affords an opportunity to reduce the background significantly .",
    "the @xmath0 channel has been extensively investigated as a channel where sm higgs boson with mass in the range @xmath7  gev should be discovered at lhc . at the leading order in perturbation theory the signal significance was estimated in ref .",
    "the obtained results suggested that @xmath0 channel is comparable with @xmath1 channel in searches for sm higgs boson : the signal significances differ slightly , while the signal - to - background ratio is several times larger for @xmath0 channel .",
    "this observation aroused the interest in phenomenology of this channel and several thorough investigations have been performed . in particular , the nlo corrections to the cross sections of the dominant signal subprocesses have been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of the infinite mass of @xmath8-quark , @xmath9 .",
    "similar to the inclusive channel , qcd corrections double the higgs production .",
    "the next natural step was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where cross sections of main qcd background subprocesses were calculated at nlo and their variations with cuts have been studied .",
    "finally , the photon smooth isolation procedure  @xcite , which is required to get rid of photons from fragmentation , was included in the analysis of the nlo qcd background .    in this work",
    "we accumulate all relevant nlo results to calculate selfconsistently the nlo signal significance for sm higgs boson production in @xmath10 channel . along with light @xmath11 quarks contribution",
    "we take into account also antiquark and heavy quark contribution missed in paper @xcite that raise the signal cross section by @xmath12% while background  by about 25% .",
    "we have found that for cuts selected as in ref .",
    "@xcite the signal significance remains almost intact with increasing order of perturbation theory .",
    "thus lo results for signal significance are stable with respect to qcd corrections .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of our results for the signal significance to be not larger than 10% , if unknown higher order qcd corrections are disregarded .",
    "let us stress that our estimates are performed in a selfconsistent way with respect to qcd perturbative calculus .",
    "then we play with varying cuts and observe that their refinement allows as much as 30% rise in the signal significance , provided that at lhc the very forward hadron calorimeters will operate properly .",
    "the discovery of sm higgs boson is a major goal of lhc . to this end",
    "many channels have been scrutinized closely .",
    "one can exploit these results to get for free accurate estimates of lhc sensitivity to new physics which manifestation mimics sm higgs boson production .",
    "indeed , any scalar uncharged under sm gauge group couples to the sm fields exactly in the same way as sm higgs boson .",
    "the only distinguishing features are values of the corresponding coupling constants , hence the production rate of the new scalar in the same channel as sm higgs boson production can be estimated by making use of a simple rescaling procedure . since the background is the same , this yields the accurate estimate of the signal significance for the production of this new scalar particle .",
    "this method is applicable to many models , in particular , to any models with extended higgs sector . in this paper",
    "we consider two examples of the appropriate models .",
    "the first example is provided by models with warped extra spatial dimensions , where new scalar particle @xmath13 , radion , emerges in the low - energy spectrum .",
    "it is associated with moduli , which vacuum expectation value @xmath14 suppresses radion coupling to the sm fields .",
    "we estimate the lhc sensitivity to @xmath14 in @xmath0 channel for the models with radion mass of @xmath7  gev .",
    "the second example is given by supersymmetric extensions of the sm with low - energy spontaneous supersymmetry breaking , where sgoldstinos gain masses of the order of electroweak scale .",
    "their couplings to the sm fields are determined by the scale @xmath15 of the supersymmetry breaking and corresponding soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "we estimate the lhc sensitivity to @xmath15 in @xmath0 channel for models with sgoldstino mass of @xmath16  gev and soft supersymmetry breaking terms within @xmath17  gev .",
    "both examples suggest that discovery potential of @xmath0 channel in searches for new physics is comparable to prospects of the inclusive channel .",
    "note in passing that radion production and sgoldstino production in inclusive channel have been estimated for the first time  @xcite by making use of the rescaling procedure similar to the one we apply in this work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we evaluate at nlo in perturbation theory the signal significance for sm higgs boson production at lhc in @xmath2 channel .",
    "there we study the dependence of the significance on variations of the selected cuts and outline the optimal set of cuts .",
    "section iii is devoted to estimates of lhc prospects in searches for new physics in this channel .",
    "namely , we consider multidimensional models with radion of @xmath7  gev and supersymmetric models with sgoldstinos of @xmath16  gev .",
    "section iv contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "we begin with studying lhc prospects in searches for sm higgs boson in @xmath0 channel .",
    "since nlo @xmath18-factors for main signal and background processes have been calculated recently  @xcite , we embrace them to improve the estimate  @xcite of the signal significance by taking into account all relevant nlo corrections . in the next sections we extend this result and estimate the lhc potential in searches for radion and sgoldstino in this channel .    in calculations of the sm higgs boson production at lhc",
    "we use the comphep package  @xcite with implemented @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 effective point - like couplings .",
    "the coupling constants entering these vertices have been obtained by matching the corresponding partial widths , evaluated by means of comphep package , with nlo results of hdecay  @xcite .",
    "this method is justified because the analysis  @xcite reveals that nlo corrections to qcd subprocesses of @xmath10 can be reproduced by almost the same @xmath18-factor as for the inclusive channel .",
    "subprocesses with @xmath22 and @xmath23 vertices are considered only at tree level of perturbation theory .",
    "although they give a substantial contribution ( about 20% ) to the signal cross section , we do not expect any considerable deviation of total nlo results for signal significance , since qcd corrections to sm higgs boson production via @xmath24-fusion are rather modest , @xmath25%  @xcite .    evaluating the rates of both signal and background processes , we adopt cteq6 m approximation to nlo parton distribution functions , and for main qcd subprocesses we set renormalization scale to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is invariant mass of the photon pair and @xmath28 is transverse momentum of the hadronic jet .",
    "for the subprocesses with @xmath29- or @xmath30-bosons we set @xmath31 .",
    "the nlo result for the background cross section was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , so to obtain the nlo approximation to the signal significance we use almost the same set of cuts : @xmath32  gev , @xmath33 for both photons and jet with @xmath34 being pseudorapidity , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( here @xmath37 is a separation between two particles @xmath38 and @xmath39 in azimuth - angle  rapidity plane ) ; the isolation parameters are taken to be @xmath40 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite for details .",
    "the nlo results for the cross sections of the main signal subprocesses and the background are presented in table  [ main ]   quarks contribution we take into account also antiquark and heavy quark contribution missed in paper @xcite that raise the signal cross section by @xmath12% while background  by about 25% . ] .",
    ".[main ] summary of main signal and background cross sections .",
    "the background photons have been collected within @xmath41 interval , where @xmath42 is the mass resolution of atlas detector  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for sm higgs boson @xmath1 decay mode is out of interest for @xmath43  gev , since higgs width starts to grow rapidly with its mass , thereby diminishing @xmath44 .",
    "the similar situation takes place in models with radion .",
    "quite the contrary , sgoldstino width is generally saturated by decay into gluons , so two - photon branching ratio remains intact for @xmath45  gev , and @xmath2 channel ( as well as inclusive one ) may be employed for searches for sgoldstino not only in the mass range relevant for sm higgs boson , @xmath46  gev , but also in a wider region .",
    "while in models with @xmath47  gev one can apply the rescaling procedure to obtain the lhc sensitivity to sgoldstino couplings , the opposite case , @xmath48  gev , requires a special study . indeed , nlo background and @xmath1-invariant mass resolution as well as photon isolation procedure",
    "have not been thoroughly analyzed for this mass interval . to estimate the lhc prospects in searches for sgoldstino with @xmath48  gev",
    ", we adopt the photon energy resolution of atlas electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite for @xmath1-invariant mass resolution .",
    "both cross section of sgoldstino production and background cross section are calculated at lo by making use of comphep - sgoldstino package  @xcite .",

    ", we have found that the ratio of signal significances of these channels is about @xmath62 , while the signal - to - background ratio is larger by a factor of @xmath63 for the channel with a high energy jet .",
    "the uncertainties of the obtained results are expected to be less than 10% , neglecting unknown higher order qcd corrections .",
    "it was shown that tuning of cuts on @xmath64 and @xmath65 in this channel could yield @xmath66% enhancement of the signal significance .",

    "moreover , with account of larger signal - to - background ratio @xmath0 channel seems even more favorable .",

    "starting from the results for sm higgs boson and adopting the rescaling procedure we have estimated the lhc prospects in searches for new physics in the channel with a high energy jet . for models with warped extra dimensions",

    "the proposed rescaling procedure can be applied for estimates of lhc sensitivity to various extensions of the sm with new ( pseudo)scalars uncharged under the sm gauge group : supersymmetric models , models with extra higgs bosons , etc .",
    "exhaustive studies of sm higgs boson production at lhc in various channels afford an opportunity of getting for free very accurate estimates of lhc sensitivities to new physics , and new scalar in @xmath0 channel is not the only example .",
    "generally , an appropriate channel can be useful in searches for new physics in a wider kinematical window , than the window viable for sm higgs boson .",
    "this occurs in models with sgoldstinos : @xmath1-decay mode survives for masses larger than 140  gev , contrary to the case of sm higgs boson . to obtain the approximation to the lhc sensitivity ,",
