    "in the pioneering work by bogoliubov @xcite , it was shown that the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of weakly interacting bosons has a phonon - type excitation mode .",
    "it is now called the bogoliubov mode , which is a nambu - goldstone mode associated with a spontaneous broken u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "this collective mode dominates low - energy properties of bec , so that it is an important key to understand physical properties of bec @xcite .",
    "in particular , the existence of bogoliubov phonon is essential for the bose - condensed phase to acquire superfluidity @xcite .",
    "since the realization of becs in ultracold atomic gases @xcite , the study of bogoliubov mode has been one of the main issues in cold atom physics @xcite . because of the high degree of controllability , the becs of cold atomic gases offer good opportunities to explore novel properties of bogoliubov excitations .",
    "recently , kovrizhin and co - workers @xcite predicted that the bogoliubov mode exhibits striking tunneling properties .",
    "they showed that the transmission probability of bogoliubov phonon through a potential barrier increases in the low energy region with decreasing the incident energy . in the low - energy limit",
    ", the perfect transmission is realized irrespective of the height of the barrier .",
    "this interesting tunneling property of bogoliubov mode is referred to as the _ anomalous tunneling _ @xcite . since their prediction @xcite ,",
    "the anomalous tunneling has attracted much attention , and has been addressed by many papers @xcite .    as the origin of the anomalous tunneling effect ,",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed , such as quasiresonance scattering @xcite , localized components of bogoliubov mode appearing near the barrier @xcite , and anomalous enhancement of quasiparticle current @xcite . for the perfect transmission in the low - energy limit , the importance of the coincidence of the condensate and excitation wave functions @xcite , as well as supercurrent behavior of low - energy bogoliubov phonons @xcite , has been pointed out .",
    "the anomalous tunneling phenomenon was shown to occur even in the supercurrent state @xcite , as well as at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "it has been also studied in the presence of a periodic potential @xcite , as well as a random potential @xcite .",
    "it has been also pointed out that similar phenomena to this can be seen in the scattering of bogoliubov phonon by a spherical potential in three dimensions d@xcite , as well as the refraction of bogoliubov phonons @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate tunneling properties of bogoliubov phonon in a bec at @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have considered the case when the incident and transmitted bogoliubov phonons feel the same condensate densities on both the right and left of the barrier . in this paper , we extend this previous paper to the case when the condensate density is different between the right and the left of the barrier . as an extreme case",
    ", we also deal with the case when the condensate density is absent on one side of the barrier . applying the finite element method to the bogoliubov coupled equations",
    ", we numerically calculate the transmission probability and phase shift of bogoliubov phonons .",
    "we find that bogoliubov phonons twist the phase of the bec order parameter ( condensate wave function ) due to a back - reaction effect , which leads to the induction of josephson supercurrent .",
    "the induced supercurrent is shown to satisfy the josephson relation with respect to the twisted phase when the condensate density is the same on both sides of the barrier .",
    "the supercurrent is induced only in the region near the barrier when the condensate has the same densities across the potential barrier . in the case",
    "when the condensate density is different between the right and left of the barrier , the supercurrent is also induced in the region far away from the barrier .",
    "in addition , the excess quasiparticle current is supplied from the condensate to conserve the total current , so that one obtains the enhancement of the transmission probability of quasiparticle current in the low - energy region .",
    "we also show that the supercurrent is induced when one injects free atoms from the outside of condensate .",
    "in addition , atoms are shown to evaporate from the surface of superfluid region when bogoliubov excitation propagates toward the superfluid - normal phase boundary .",
