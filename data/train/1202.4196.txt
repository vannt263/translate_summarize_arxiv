    "we deal with the problem of maximizing @xmath12 given @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "more formally , let @xmath14 denote the set of all @xmath0-graphs @xmath4 such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; moreover let @xmath17 and @xmath18 let us describe two kinds of @xmath0-graphs from @xmath14 which are natural candidates for members of @xmath19 .",

    "furthermore , we define @xmath28 as the family of all @xmath0-graphs @xmath29 which consists of a  complete subgraph on @xmath30 and some isolated vertices , i.e. if for some subset @xmath31 , @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 again , we have @xmath34 . in 1965",
    "erds  @xcite conjectured that , indeed , the function @xmath35 is fully determined by @xmath0-graphs of these two types , namely that for every @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath36 , the following holds @xmath37    although the conjecture remains widely open a few results have been proved in this direction ( cf .",
    "frankl  @xcite ) .",
    "most of them are dealing with the case when @xmath1 is large compared to @xmath2 , proving that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is some function of @xmath0 .",
    "the best published bound for @xmath39 for general @xmath0 is due to bollobs , daykin and erds  @xcite who showed that  ( [ eq : bde1 ] ) holds whenever @xmath40 ; recently , huang , loh , and  sudakov  @xcite announced that  ( [ eq : bde1 ] ) remains true for @xmath41 .",
    "as for the special case of @xmath3 the current record belongs to frankl , rdl and ruciski  @xcite who verifed ( [ eq : bde1 ] ) for @xmath3 and @xmath42 .",
    "the main result of this paper states that for @xmath3 and @xmath1 large enough ( [ eq : erdos_conj ] ) holds for every @xmath2 and , moreover , the only extremal @xmath43-graphs belong to either @xmath20 or @xmath28 .",

    "note however that the second part of the statement does not hold when @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( or , for general @xmath0-graphs , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath50 ) .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath53 while @xmath54    the structure of the paper goes as follows .",
    "first we show that if the structure of a large graph from @xmath55 is ` close ' to a graph from @xmath20 , then it belongs to @xmath20 , and the same remains true for @xmath28 .",
    "thus , an ` asymptotic version ' of theorem  [ thm : main ] implies that it holds in its exact form , provided @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "then , we recall the definition and basic properties of the shift operation which is another important ingredient of our argument . finally ,",

    "the aim of this section is to show that if a @xmath0-graph @xmath58 is , in such a way , similar to graphs from @xmath20 [ or @xmath28 ] , then in fact it belongs to this family . in order to make it precise let us introduce families of graphs @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "2 , then @xmath320 .",
    "thus , let assume that for each of these pairs at least one edge is not in @xmath343 and @xmath360 .",
    "hence @xmath346 and @xmath352 .",
    "now consider @xmath361 , @xmath362 , @xmath363 .",
    "it is easy to check that if at most one of them is in @xmath343 , then @xmath364 .",
    "thus , we split our further argument into two cases .",
    "then , @xmath365 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 , @xmath352 . therefore , as @xmath368 ,",
    "at least two pairs of edges shown on fig .",
    "are in  @xmath343 .",
    "let say these are @xmath369 and @xmath370 . since @xmath115 is good ,",
    "edges @xmath371 , @xmath372 , @xmath373 , @xmath374 are not in @xmath292 , and because @xmath292 is shifted , the edges of @xmath292 contained in @xmath264 are contained in the set @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 , @xmath379 , @xmath380 , @xmath381 .",
    "hence , @xmath332 .",
    "it is also easy to observe that in that case @xmath331 .      without loss of generality",
    "let @xmath361 , @xmath382 .",
    "then , @xmath363 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 , @xmath352 . therefore , if @xmath383 , then all other edges are in @xmath343 , and so two pairs of edges shown on fig .",
    "are in @xmath343 .",
    "thus , as we have shown in the proof of case 1 , @xmath332 .",
    "let now consider the case when @xmath384 .",
    "if both pairs of edges @xmath385 and @xmath386 , @xmath361 are in @xmath343 , then again @xmath332 .",
    "let now assume that only one of these pairs is in @xmath343 , let say @xmath387 . then also a pair @xmath388 is in @xmath343 .",
    "thus , @xmath376 , @xmath379 , @xmath374 , @xmath389 , and therefore , @xmath332 .",
    "in that case we also have @xmath331 .",
    "now we bound the number of edges in @xmath223 .",
    "first of all let us remove from @xmath87 six edges so that in the remaining matching @xmath390 we have only good triples ( see claim  [ cl : bad ] ) .",
    "in this way we omit at most @xmath391 edges of @xmath223 .",
    "let us recall also that the number of untraceable edges of @xmath223 is at most @xmath392 . finally , observe that for each edge @xmath393 there are at most @xmath394 edges @xmath395 such that @xmath396 .",
    "thus , the number of edges in @xmath223 is bounded from above by @xmath397 to bound @xmath398 , let us sum @xmath309 over all @xmath399 . observe that in such a  sum each edge from @xmath310 is cour nted exactly @xmath400 times .",
    "thus , @xmath401 now we divide good triples into @xmath402 groups , depending on @xmath318 .",
    "if @xmath403 for @xmath404 , then @xmath405 let now denote @xmath406 , @xmath407 , @xmath408 , @xmath409 , @xmath410 . by claim  [ cl33 ] , we get the following bound . @xmath411 now it is sufficient to maximize the above function under the conditions @xmath412 and @xmath413 for every @xmath414 .",
    "then , we are to maximize a function @xmath415 where @xmath416 over domain @xmath417 , @xmath418 for @xmath419 .",
    "this is a linear function of @xmath420 s , so in order to maximize it it is enough to check which of the coefficients @xmath421 is the largest one and set the variable @xmath420 which corresponds to this coefficient to be maximum , while the rest of the variables should be equal to zero .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath422 and @xmath423 , where @xmath424 , then @xmath425 dominates , and so for @xmath422 , @xmath423 , we have @xmath426 what nicely matches the lower bound for @xmath427 given by @xmath428 furthermore , in order to achieve this bound for all but @xmath429 triples @xmath115 we must have @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 , which is possible only if all edges of such triple intersect @xmath246 ( see claim  [ cl33](iii ) ) . consequently , for this range of @xmath2 , in @xmath223 there is a subset @xmath246 , @xmath430 , which covers all but at most @xmath429 edges of @xmath223 .",
    "for @xmath431 the dominating coefficient is @xmath432 , which gives @xmath433 matched by the lower bound @xmath434 again to achieve this bound for all but @xmath429 triples we must have @xmath435 .",
    "but then the largest independent set contained in @xmath436 has at most @xmath437 vertices and so , because of shifting , @xmath436 contains a clique of size at least @xmath438 .    in order to complete the proof we need to consider the remaining case when @xmath439 . since @xmath440 for @xmath441",
    ", we infer that in @xmath223 all triples , except of at most @xmath429 , must be of one of two types : either for such a triple @xmath115 we have @xmath435 , @xmath442 , or @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath443 and all edges of @xmath142 contained in @xmath264 intersect @xmath246 .",
    "it is easy to see that it is possible only when one of these two types of triples dominate .",
    "indeed , let @xmath444 denote the set of edges of@xmath87 which contain a singleton edge form @xmath296 . since the number of triples which are contained neither in @xmath124 , nor in @xmath445 is @xmath446 ,",
    "so @xmath447 is bounded and , consequently , all but @xmath448 triples must be of one of our two types .",
