    "dynamical responses to experimental probes from the high - temperature superconductors are an important subject in condensed matter physics , since they may hold key information to resolve the origin of the superconductivity@xcite .",

    "perhaps it is due to the belief that although the physics at high energy may play a role in the pairing mechanism at low energy , it is unlikely affected by the superconductivity , given that the superconducting gap is only around the order of 10 - 50 mev .    in this regard ,",
    "the observation of significant changes in optical conductivity due to the superconductivity up to energy as high as the order of 1 ev in cuprates@xcite and iron - based superconductors@xcite is a shocking result .",
    "these experiments found significant differences in the optical conductivity between the normal and superconducting states in a wide range of frequencies . according to the bcs theory , regardless of the origin of the pairing mechanism ,",

    ", the dynamical responses should remain unchanged at frequency much higher than the superconducting gap , as shown in the seminal papers of anderson on the theory of plasmon excitation in superconductors@xcite .",
    "therefore , these unusual changes at high energy are naively attributed to the strong local interaction such as hubbard @xmath4 or heisenberg @xmath5 , but a detailed theory is still lacking .    a even more fundamental question raised by turlakov and leggett@xcite places more constraints on the study of the superconductivity - induced changes in the optical conductivity . based on a rigorous consideration of the three sum rules j_n=-1,1,3 ( )",

    "while in the semiconductors the umklapp processes have been included in the first - principle calculations , known as the local field effect@xcite , the role of umklapp processes in the correlated materials as well as in the superconducting states is still not understood . in this paper , we investigate the effects due to umklapp processes on the density - density correlation function in both normal and superconducting states .",
