    "despite more than 40 years of observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the radiation mechanism during the prompt emission phase is still being debated .",
    "observationally the time - resolved spectra are usually characterized by a smoothly - joint broken power law , known as the `` band '' function @xcite .",
    "the typical value of the low - energy photon spectral index @xmath9 ( the one below the peak energy @xmath10 ) is around -1 @xcite value in the time resolved spectra at the beginning or around the peak of the light curve @xcite . in some other cases ,",
    "a blackbody component can play a dominant role @xcite . ] .",
    "this value is not straightwardly predicted in available models . in general",
    "there are two broad categories of grb prompt emission models , one invoking a comptonized quasi - thermal emission from the photosphere of the outflow @xcite , the other invoking a non - thermal ( synchrotron or synchrotron - self - compton ) mechanism in the optically thin region @xcite .",
    "recent observations with fermi @xcite confirmed the pre - fermi suggestion @xcite that the observed grb spectra sometimes include superposition of a quasi - thermal component with a non - thermal component , suggesting that the photosphere emission indeed contributes to the observed grb spectra of at least some grbs .",
    "the question is how much the photosphere emission contributes to the observed spectra .",
    "there are two different opinions .",
    "according to the first opinion , only the quasi - thermal component identified in some grbs is of the photosphere origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the main `` band '' component is non - thermal emission from an optically thin region .",
    "the second , more optimistic opinion suggests that the main band component is of a photosphere origin , and the observed @xmath10 is defined by the photosphere temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    within this second scenario",
    ", one needs to broaden the quasi - thermal spectrum to a mimic the observed `` band '' function .",
    "the high - energy photon index can be easily interpreted by introducing dissipation of energy near photosphere so that non - thermal electrons are accelerated to upscatter the seed quasi - thermal photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the main difficulty is to account for the observed low - energy photon index @xmath0 , since the predicted value is much harder than this value ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has been speculated that geometric smearing and temporal smearing may soften the spectrum to make @xmath9 closer to -1 , but no thorough study has been carried out .    another interesting observational feature is the @xmath10 evolution in grbs .",
    "observtionally two patterns are identified : hard - to - soft evolution or @xmath10-intensity tracking @xcite across a broad grb pulse ( or the  slow  variability component , * ? ? ?",
    "various data analyses suggest that both patterns co - exist , sometimes in a same burst . for short grbs ,",
    "the tracking behavior is most common , while for long grbs , especially for the first broad pulse , the hard - to - soft evolution is relatively more common ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "simulations show that in long grbs , tracking pulses after the first pulse could be due to a superposition of multiple hard - to - soft pulses @xcite , and it has been argued that the hard - to - soft evolution pattern may be ubiquitous among long grbs @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to see what @xmath10 evolution pattern the photosphere model predicts .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the predictions of @xmath9 values and @xmath10 evolutions within the simplest photosphere model ( a co - moving blackbody spectrum and a uniform jet ) by fully treating the geometrical and temporal smearing effects . in sect.2",
    ", we describe our methodology , in particular , improvements upon previous work .",
    "we then present calculations of photosphere spectra and @xmath10 evolution patterns in progressively more complicated models in sect.3 .",
    "the conclusions are drawns in sect.4 .",
    "photosphere may be roughly defined as a radius at which the thomson scattering optical depth for a photon is @xmath11 . from the microscopic view ,",
    "an individual photon in the outflow can be in principle last scattered by an electron at any position with a certain probability .",
    "one should introduce a probability function to describe photosphere emission @xcite .",
    "in general , for a group of photons emerging from deep inside the photosphere , they can undergo last scattering at any location ( @xmath12 ) inside the outflow , where @xmath13 is the radius from the explosion center , and @xmath14 defines the angular coordinates .",
    "a probability function @xmath15 is introduced to describe the chance of last scattering at any location .",
    "so far , a most detailed treatment of the probability function was presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . by making some simplifications in modeling ,",
    "their model caught the essence of the photospheric physics .",
    "the basic physical picture of @xcite can be summarized as follows ( see the cartoon picture figure [ model_peer]a ) : the central engine remains active for a while and forms a conical outflow . after some time the central engine is shut down .",
    "they assumed that the wind luminosity @xmath1 , the initial mass loss rate @xmath16 , and hence , the initial bulk lorentz factor @xmath17 , are all constant .",
    "this means that a continuous wind with a time - independent density profile is established . for simplicity",
    ", they also assumed that such a wind extends to an infinite distance . as a result",
    ", the optical depth could be directly calculated by an analytical formula , which is time - independent @xcite .",
    "another simplification of @xcite is that they only considered an instantaneous deposition of photons in one thin layer at the center of an expanding outflow plasma . in reality , photons are continuously deposited into a series of layers ejected by a long - lasting central engine .",
    "this would make calculations more complicated .",
    "a third simplification in their analytical approach is that they assumed a mono - energetic photon field , while in reality the photons have a distribution ( e.g. blackbody in the co - moving frame ) .",
    "this assumption was removed in their numerical approach through monte carlo simulations . in any case ,",
    "an analytical approach to handle the blackbody spectrum is welcome .    ",
    "in order to give a more precise treatment on more realistic situations , in this paper we make several critical improvements on the previous work to establish a more sophisticated photosphere model to study the instantaneous and time - integrated spectra and @xmath2 evolution by allowing a time - varying central engine wind , and hence , the optical depth .",
    "our improvements on the previous work include the following : 1 .",
    "we introduce a blackbody distribution of the photons in the comoving frame , to replace the mono - energetic photon distribution in the analytical treatment of @xcite and @xcite ; 2 . for a wind lasting for a certain duration , at any instant , photons from different layers and latitudes , which were emitted at different epochs , are received . instead of the traditional `` equal - arrival - time - surface '' effect commonly considered in an afterglow model , one needs to consider `` equal - arrival - time - volume '' for a more precise treatment of the photosphere emission .",
    "we separate the outflow into many thin layers , follow the last scattering of electrons from each layer individually , and calculate the sum of flux from all the layers from different latitudes and emission times , but at a same observer time ; 3 .",
    "we introduce a finite , dynamically evolving front of the outflow based on the assumed injection history of the outflow .",
    "this would affect the calculation of the thomson scattering optical depth of the photons , which leads to a more precise derivation of the photosphere radius in different directions .",
    "the effect is especially important in the early phase of the outflow ; 4 .",
    "since grb lightcurves show an erratic behavior , we introduce time - dependent wind luminosity and baryon loading to allow a more realistic treatment of time - variable photosphere emission .    a cartoon picture of our improved model is shown is fig.[model_peer]b , as compared with fig.[model_peer]a .",
    "due to the finite central engine activity time , the outflow has a finite thickness .",
    "we separate the outflow into many thin layers , each characterized by an initial wind luminosity @xmath1 and an initial mass loading rate @xmath18 . to treat the equal - arrival - time volume effect , we consider two levels of integration .",
    "the first level handles the equal - arrival - time surface of each layer : photons emitted from different latitudes at different times arrive the observer at the same time ; the second level handles superposition of emission from different layers : high - latitude emission from an earlier layer would arrive at the same time with low - latitude emission from a later layer .    in order to analytically treat the problem",
    ", some assumptions still need to be made .",
    "one important parameter is the lorentz factor @xmath17 of each layer . according to the standard fireball model @xcite",
    ", @xmath17 should initially increase with radius before coasting to a certain value .",
    "the coasting @xmath17 depends on a comparison between the dimensionless entropy of the fireball @xmath8 and a critical value @xmath19 @xcite . if @xmath20 , the photosphere radius @xmath21 is above the saturation radius @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the radius of the central engine ) , and the lorentz factor coasts to a constant value @xmath24 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the photosphere occurs during the fireball acceleration phase ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath17 would vary significantly across @xmath21 , which is difficult to handle analytically . in our treatment , we have made the assumption of a constant @xmath27 throughout the shell evolution ( i.e. the acceleration phase is neglected ) . in our model , for a certain layer",
    "although all the positions have a certain probability to release the last - scattered photon , the maximum probability is concentrated around the photosphere radius @xmath21 .",
    "so our calculation of the emerging photosphere spectrum based on the assumption of a constant @xmath27 is accurate enough as long as @xmath28 , but would become progressively inaccurate as @xmath21 becomes progressively smaller . in our calculations ,",
    "this constraint is considered in care , so that the presented spectra are all in the regime where this assumption is valid .",
    "in this section , we calculate the photosphere spectra by progressively including the four new physical ingredients as discussed above . in  [ sec : bb ] we introduce a blackbody spectrum in the comoving frame , while still keeping the basic assumptions of @xcite such as a constant wind luminosity , infinity outer boundary and single layer emission . in  [ sec : wind ] we introduce multiple layers to study the superposed spectrum . in  [ sec : variable_boundary ] , keeping the wind luminosity constant , we introduce a time - evolving outer boundary of the outflow . in  [ sec : variable_luminosity ] we introduce a time - dependent wind luminosity and time - evolving outer boundary of the outflow at the same time .",
    "a discussion on @xmath10 evolution patterns are presented in  [ sec : ep - patterns ] .      in this section",
    "we still keep most simplifications made by @xcite , including instantaneous injection of photons and an outer boundary at infinity .",
    "one modification is that we relax the @xmath29-function assumption of photon energy @xcite , but introduce a more realistic co - moving blackbody spectrum .",
    "we start with the formula of @xcite that calculates the specific flux : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the impulsively injected number of photons at @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the probability density function for the last scattering to occur at the radius @xmath13 and to an angle @xmath34 , respectively , and the parameter @xmath35 contains the angular information .    for the probability density function @xmath33 ,",
    "@xcite used two independent functions @xmath36 ( for the radial dimension ) and @xmath37 ( for the angular dimension ) to decompose @xmath33 into @xmath38 , where @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the classical photosphere radius ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 on the other hand , the simulation result in @xcite indicated that @xmath36 depends on angle and @xmath37 also depends on radius .",
    "@xcite later introduced a two dimensional @xmath33 function based on the assumption of outer boundary at infinity : @xmath44\\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\exp\\left[-\\frac{r_{\\rm ph}}{6r } \\left(3+\\frac{1-\\mu'}{1+\\mu'}\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq : pru_bel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is in the outflow comoving frame , @xmath46 is in the observer frame , and the doppler factor is @xmath47^{-1 } = ( \\gamma u)^{-1}.\\ ] ] in this section and  [ sec : wind ] , we will use eq.[eq : pru_bel ] as @xmath33 in eq.[eq : peer ] .    the last @xmath29 function in eq.[eq : peer ]",
    "made the mono - energetic simplification for the photosphere photons .",
    "we consider a blackbody distribution of the photon energy and replace eq.[eq : peer ] by a new equation @xmath48 where we have defined a new parameter @xmath49 which is the probability function of a photon with frequence @xmath50 in a plank distribution with a temperature @xmath51 at the coordinate @xmath52 as observed by an observer located at @xmath42 , and @xmath53 is the specific photon number density at frequency @xmath50 for an observed temperature @xmath51 . here",
    "the mathematical relation @xmath54 has been applied when calculating the integration @xmath55 .",
    "notice that here we have also adopted a blackbody function for the observed spectrum at any spatial point @xmath56 .",
    "this is justified , since for any spatial point , the spectral shape is not modified from that in the co - moving frame , except that the entire spectrum is doppler boosted by the local doppler factor @xcite .",
    "the global observed spectrum deviates from a blackbody due to different doppler factors at different points .",
    "this effect is fully incorporated in our calculations .",
    "the observer frame temperature at point @xmath56 @xmath57 depends on the angle through the doppler factor and on the co - moving temperature .",
    "the co - moving frame temperature @xmath58 is more intrinsic , which depends on the radius @xmath13 only .",
    "its expression depends on the radius range @xcite , and can be calculated using the on - axis observed temperature divided by the on - axis dopper factor @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the temperature at the central engine , @xmath62 is the initial luminosity deposited at the central engine , and @xmath63 is the central engine radius .",

    "since we mostly care about the shape of the spectrum , the normalization parameter @xmath31 is approximately taken as @xmath65 which denotes the rough total number of photons released at the central engine ( assuming mono - energetic photon energy ) . by doing so , we have assumed that no additional emission or absorption processes occur as the photon - mediated outflow travels from the central engine to the photosphere , and that photons only undergo thomson scattering with the total number conserved .",
    "we integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : fnu1 ] to calculate the instantaneous spectra at different times .",

    "as studied in this subsection , we calculate @xmath68 by taking @xmath69 , while adopt the impulsively injected total wind energy @xmath70 erg .",
    "this is to keep consistency with the continuous - wind calculations in the later subsections .",

    "different colors represent different observational times .",
    "the spectra become progressively high - latitude dominated . ]    from fig.[fig : bb ] , we can see that under the assumptions adopted in this subsection , the on - axis , instantaneous photosphere spectrum evolves from a pure blackbody ( early on ) to a gradually flattened shape as the high - latitude emission becomes progressively dominant .",

    "figure [ fig : wind ] presents the observed instantaneous photosphere spectra of a continuous wind with a constant luminosity and lorentz factor .",
    "one can see several interesting features .",
    "the instantaneous spectrum is initially ( @xmath97 s ) blackbody - like with @xmath94 below the peak ( rayleigh - jeans regime ) .",
    "soon after , the spectrum below the peak starts to flatten , and a new segment with @xmath95 starts to merge below the peak .",
    "the reason for this softening can be understood from the results presented in fig.[fig : bb ] , which delineates the time evolution of instantaneous spectra of each layer .",
    "an old layer is high - latitude dominated , so that a more extended plateau with @xmath98 spectral segment shows up .",
    "a relatively newer layer has a shorter plateau , and the newest layer has no plateau .",
    "the superposition of emission from all these layers give rise to relatively softer spectral segment .",
    "the spectral index of this new segment ( @xmath95 ) is consistent with the result of @xcite , who obtained a similar spectral index using a different method .",
    "notice that in fig.[fig : wind ] the absolute flux increases with time .",
    "this is because at early epochs , the outmost layer only reaches a certain @xmath13 above which no photons are released .",
    "given a simplistic probability function defined in eq.[pr ] or eq.[eq : pru_bel ] , a good fraction of photons do not contribute to the observed flux . in the following (  [ sec : variable_boundary ] ) , we will give a more accurate treatment on this effect .",
    "figure [ fig : wind_shut_down ] presents the instantaneous photosphere spectral evolution with the assumption that central engine shuts down after a certain duration .",
    "we calculate three different central engine durations : 0.1s ( red group curves ) , 1s ( green group curves ) and 10s ( blue group curves ) . for each case",
    ", we calculate four instantaneous spectra with different observational times : solid line ( end of constant luminosity injection ) , dashed line ( one order of magntitude in time after the injection phase ) , dotted line ( two orders of magnitude after ) and dash - dotted line ( three orders of magnitude after ) .",
    "the results show that the shape of the spectrum become high - latitude dominated at later times , but early on there is a rapid falling phase . in order to fully reveal this feature",
    ", we calculate the photosphere luminosity evolution with time ( light curve ) as shown in fig.[fig : wind_lph ] .",
    "our results show that the luminosity evolution depends on the duration of the central engine .",
    "even though at late times the decaying slope of @xmath99 is @xmath96 , shortly after wind terminates , @xmath99 decays rapidly like free - fall .",
    "this is caused by the inaccurate estimate of the normalization parameter @xmath100 ( eq.([eq : ndot ] ) . ] .",
    "the longer of the central engine duration , the more significant the initial rapid drop it is .",
    "only when the duration becomes as short as a characteristic duration @xmath101@xcite @xmath102s , does the rapid falling phase disappear ( black curve in fig.[fig : wind_lph ] .",

    "previously @xcite analyzed the data from 56 long grbs .",
    "they found that the light curves decay rate is universally around @xmath96 .",
    "they considered this as consistent with the prediction of the high latitude emission of the photosphere model .",
    "our results in fig.[fig : wind_lph ] suggest that this interpretation is unlikely , since there is no steep decay phase ( 4 orders of magnitude drop in flux for a 1 s wind ) observed .",
    "so far we have assumed that the outer boundary of the outflow is at infinity . for a constant luminosity wind ,",
    "the optical depth at a certain position in the outflow is time independent .",
    "however , in real situations invoking a short , variable wind from a grb , the outer boundary is time variable . as a result ,",
    "the optical depth at a certain position in the outflow is time dependent and changes rapidly with time at early epochs due to the relativistic motion of the outflow , especially during the early phase of wind injection .",
    "since the optical depth is one of the key factors to decide the photosphere probability function , the probability function also becomes time dependent .",

    "<S> a softer ( @xmath5 ) or flat ( @xmath6 ) spectrum can be obtained during the @xmath1 decreasing phase or high - latitude - emission - dominated phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the evolution of @xmath2 as a function of wind and photosphere luminosity in this photosphere model . an @xmath7 tracking pattern can be reproduced if a certain positive dependence between the dimensionless entropy @xmath8 and @xmath1 is introduced </S>",
    "<S> . however , the hard - to - soft evolution pattern can not be reproduced unless a contrived condition is invoked . in order to interpret the band spectrum , a more complicated photosphere model or a different energy dissipation and radiation mechanism are needed .    </S>"
