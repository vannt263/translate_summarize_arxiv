    "although we expect the clustering of galaxies in real space to have no preferred direction , galaxy maps produced by estimating distances from redshifts obtained in spectroscopic surveys reveal an anisotropic galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy arises because the recession velocities of galaxies , from which distances are inferred , include components from both the hubble flow and from peculiar velocities driven by the clustering of matter ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "despite the fact that galaxy light does not faithfully trace the mass , even on large scales , galaxies are expected to act nearly as test particles within the cosmological matter flow .",

    "rsd and ap tests rely on the measurements of anisotropy in the statistical properties of the galaxy distribution and are partially degenerate with each other , so that constraints on the growth of structure from rsd depend on the assumptions about the background geometry and vice versa @xcite .",
    "however , given high precision clustering measurements over a wide range of scales , this degeneracy can be broken since rsd and ap have different scale - dependences .",

    "the halo model of large - scale structure and variants thereof assume that galaxies form and evolve in the potential wells of dark matter halos , and provides a successful means of parametrizing the relation between the galaxy and halo density and velocity fields .",
    "our modeling approach , based on @xcite , uses perturbation theory to account for the nonlinear redshift space clustering of halos in the quasilinear regime as a function of cosmological parameters , and then uses the halo model framework to motivate our choice of nuisance parameters describing the galaxy - halo relation .",

    "the galaxies are selected from the multi - color sdss imaging to probe large - scale structure at intermediate redshift ; they trace a large cosmological volume while having high enough number density to ensure that shot - noise is not a dominant contributor to the clustering variance @xcite .",
    "the resulting clustering measurements provide strong constraints on the parameters of standard cosmological models .",
    "we use the cmass sample of boss galaxies that will be included in sdss data release 9 ( dr9 ) to constrain the growth of structure and geometry of the universe .",
    "we apply rsd and ap tests to the data to measure the growth rate , the hubble expansion rate , and the comoving angular diameter distance at @xmath20 .",
    "we improve on previous , similar analyses in a number of ways .",
    "first , we use a model for the nonlinear anisotropic correlation function that is accurate to well below our statistical errors over the wide range of scales between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which we validate using 68(@xmath23gpc)@xmath24 of @xmath18-body simulations populated with mock cmass galaxies .",
    "next , rather than assuming a fixed underlying linear matter power spectrum , we use a prior on @xmath25 based on the wmap7 cosmic microwave background constraints @xcite and marginalize over the remaining uncertainties for all fits .",
    "in addition to joint constraints on the geometric ( bao and ap ) and peculiar velocity ( rsd ) parameters , we present three `` null '' tests of the @xmath8cdm model . to begin , we simply ask whether any points in the @xmath8cdm parameter space allowed by wmap7 provide a good fit to the cmass clustering ; in this case , the only free parameters are those describing how galaxies trace matter . in the other two tests , we fit for the amplitude of peculiar velocities using wmap7 priors on geometric quantities , or we fit for the geometric parameters with wmap7 priors on rsd .",
    "thus we can present the statistical precision with which our data measure either peculiar velocities or the ap effect in the @xmath8cdm model . finally , given the strong detection of the bao feature in the monopole of the correlation function",

    "however , we have verified that for variations of @xmath287 per cent in @xmath137 and/or @xmath288 per cent in @xmath139 ( i.e. , much larger than the final uncertainties ) , the theoretical error induces @xmath289 shifts in all parameters compared with the unmarginalized uncertainties .    finally , we point out that unlike in linear theory , our model depends on @xmath90 , @xmath171 , and @xmath145 separately , rather than the only the combinations @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "however , at the particular @xmath102 and @xmath103 values of our sample , we find that changes in the predicted @xmath122 with @xmath145 can be absorbed by changes in the value of @xmath102 .",
    "quantitatively , for a @xmath140 per cent change in away from our fiducial @xmath290 and at fixed @xmath25 , ap parameters , and @xmath291 mpc@xmath128 , @xmath102 shifts by @xmath292 with no measurable shift in the central value of @xmath103 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : theoryfits ] , our model with @xmath293 fits the @xmath104 of our mock galaxy catalogs , based on the best - fitting hod in @xcite . in this section",
    "we quantify how uncertainties in both the theoretical modeling and data analysis cause uncertainty in the expected value of @xmath121 for the cmass sample .",
    "we address several aspects of this problem separately .",
    "* _ one - halo vs two - halo contributions to @xmath122 and fiber collision corrections _ : the formalism of the halo model distinguishes between `` one - halo '' and `` two - halo '' pairs depending on whether the two galaxies occupy the same or different halos . in figure [ fig:1hvs2h ]",
    "we show the total change in @xmath122 due to satellite galaxy intrahalo velocities ( ihv ) by the dashed ( dotted ) curves in our mock catalogs .",
    "the dash - dot and solid curves show the contributions to this change in @xmath122 from one - halo pairs , which are localized to along the los with @xmath294 .",
    "because the one - halo pairs contribute to such a small @xmath295 , they can be neglected on the scales used in our cosmological parameter fits , @xmath296 .",
    "this fact is important to establish since our method for fiber collision corrections will correctly recover the distribution of pair separations for pairs of galaxies with separations larger than the fiber collision scale , but suppresses the contribution of pairs of galaxies at the fiber collision scale ( @xmath297 ) . * _ uncertainty in the hod at fixed cosmology _ : uncertainties in the hod parameters will introduce an uncertainty in @xmath121 .",
    "while @xmath121 is roughly proportional to the satellite fraction , it also depends on the distribution of host halo mass  increasing @xmath298 and @xmath299 increases host halo mass at fixed satellite fraction , which increases @xmath121 .",
    "we use mcmc chains from @xcite to estimate our uncertainty on @xmath121 at fixed cosmology to be 6 mpc@xmath300 . *",
    "_ breakdown of the `` central '' galaxy assumption _ : the analysis of @xcite suggests that the brightest galaxy in a halo is not always the `` central '' one .",
    "we test the impact of relaxing our assumption that the velocity of mock central galaxies have no intrahalo velocities by assigning them the intrahalo velocity of a random dark matter particle halo member in our simulations some fraction @xmath184 of the time .",
    "when we have more than one galaxy in a halo , we assume that the chance of not including the `` central '' galaxy in our sample is lower , @xmath301 . for @xmath302 , we find @xmath121 at our fiducial hod is increased by 9 mpc@xmath128 . * _ variations in the halo mass function with cosmological parameters _ :",
    "a broad range of observations shows good agreement between the concordance @xmath8cdm halo mass function and the multiplicity of galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so this uncertainty is subdominant : even if our fiducial hod masses were scaled by a factor of 2 , @xmath303 would change by 11 mpc@xmath128 .",
    "given the above considerations , we adopted a generous hard prior on @xmath121 between 0 and 40 mpc@xmath128 .",
    "we adopt a hybrid mcmc / importance resampling approach to explore the boss likelihood surface with various priors imposed from the wmap7 likelihood in models 1 - 4 .",
    "this approach is necessary in our case because our model evaluation is slow , and we must marginalize over @xmath102 and @xmath121 at each point in parameter space that we consider .",
    "this section describes our methods in each case .",
    "wmap7 mcmc chains are publicly available .",
    "these chains provide a fair sample of the wmap7 likelihood surface .",
    "importance resampling @xcite allows us to compute how constraints on the model parameters change given an additional constraint by evaluating the new likelihood at a subsample of the original mcmc chain , multiplying the original weight of each element by the new likelihood , and then recomputing confidence intervals .",
    "for this model we marginalize only over two parameters , so it is feasible to directly compute a marginalized cmass likelihood : @xmath304 we then use importance resampling of the wmap7 chain parameters .",
    "[ [ model-2-wmap7cmass - lambdacdm - geometry - free - growth - model-3-wmap7cmass - lambdacdm - growth - free - geometry ] ] model 2 wmap7+cmass @xmath8cdm geometry , free growth ; model 3 wmap7+cmass @xmath8cdm growth , free geometry ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in models 2 and 3 , for each linear matter power spectrum , we must vary three or four extra parameters describing the galaxy clustering observations .",
    "we therefore explore the likelihood surface at each point in the wmap7 chain by mcmc , and thereby sample the cmass likelihood distribution @xmath305 . in model 2 , @xmath306 , and in model 3 ,",
    "mcmc chains at a fixed @xmath308 sample parameter space proportional to @xmath309 , but in order to compute the marginalized likelihood of @xmath103 in model 2 or @xmath310 in model 3 , we must determine the relative likelihood of the mcmc chains evaluated at different @xmath311 .",
    "since @xmath312 where @xmath18 is an overall normalization , we can combine the @xmath313 computed at any point with the probability density estimated by our mcmc to determine the relative normalization of @xmath314 . in practice , we first normalize each mcmc distribution so that @xmath315 , find @xmath316 with the minimum value of @xmath313 in each chain , and integrate @xmath317 in a small , fixed size region of parameter space around @xmath318 , which we call @xmath319 . , we restrict @xmath320 to be sufficiently far from the hard prior boundary of @xmath121 , so that the volume element @xmath321 does not intersect the hard boundary . the difference between @xmath322 and the global @xmath313 minimum is small , since @xmath121 is poorly constrained by our measurements . ] the relative weight of each point in the wmap - only mcmc chain is then determined by the cmass - only likelihood value and @xmath323 : @xmath324 we find that our constraints are the same if we neglect this volume weighting factor @xmath325 , indicating that the effective volume of parameter space allowed by the cmass measurements does not strongly depend on the underlying cosmological parameters @xmath326 when exploring the region of this parameter space allowed by wmap7 .",
    "in this case , we use wmap data to provide a prior on the shape of the linear matter power spectrum , which is well approximated by a multivariate gaussian in the parameters @xmath327 , @xmath227 , @xmath151 .",
    "wmap7 constraints on these parameters primarily come from ratios of peak heights and the overall shape , rather than the locations of the peaks ( which are sensitive to the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface ) .",
    "therefore , marginalized likelihood for these parameters is nearly independent of the adopted model for the low redshift expansion history ( i.e. , whether @xmath158 , or @xmath157 are freely varied ) .",
    "thus we are able to make use of the cmb information on the underlying linear matter power spectrum that is independent of the model for the low redshift expansion history , and does not contain information on the distance to the last scattering surface . by using the linear matter power spectrum as a `` standard ruler '' , we are able to infer information about the geometric parameters @xmath193 and @xmath139 . in this case",
    "we run an mcmc chain with the following 8 parameters , adding an additional multivariate gaussian likelihood representing the cmb prior on the three linear matter power spectrum parameters : @xmath328 ."
