    "the history of galactic bulges remains a key issue in studies of the origin of the hubble sequence . originally thought to form at high redshift through dissipationless collapse ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) , their continued growth , as predicted in hierarchical models ( baugh et  al .",

    "the different physical scales involved in these local scaling relations represent a major theoretical challenge ( miralda - escud & kollmeier 2005 ) . as ambiguities remain even if fairly precise observations are available for local samples , an important route to understanding this puzzle lies with undertaking observations at intermediate redshift .",

    "the authors found a remarkable diversity in bulge colors over the redshift range 0.3@xmath0@xmath10@xmath01 ( using both spectroscopic and photometrically determined redshifts ) , with few as red as a passively - evolving track which matches the integrated colors of luminous spheroidal galaxies observed in the hdfs .",
    "ead concluded that bulges have suffered recent periodic episodes of rejuvenation consistent with 1530% growth in stellar mass since @xmath10@xmath121 .",

    "the first part is motivated by the arrival of superior resolution multi - color acs imaging data in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields ; this represents a significant improvement over the wfpc2 data used by ead and koo05 .",
    "the goods acs dataset offers the potential of securing improved photometric parameters . in particular , ead chose not to undertake bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) decomposition , arguing by example with local data ( de  jong 1996 ) that aperture colors were adequate . in the present paper",
    ", we revisit this discussion using a larger sample with equivalently - deep but higher spatial resolution , broader wavelength coverage , spectroscopic redshifts , and employing photometric decompositions of bulge and disk parameters .",
    "the second component is concerned with securing dynamical estimates of the bulge stellar masses from resolved spectroscopy . at intermediate redshifts ,",

    "2003 ) on the keck ii telescope .",
    "following recent progress in interpreting the mass assembly history of field spheroidals ( e.g.  t05 ) , mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath16 ) determined from fp analyses are much superior to interpretations based solely on optical colors .",

    "[ sec : spec_results ] we compare the fp of bulges with the trends now well - established for more massive e / s0 galaxies .",

    "we note that both diagnostics considered in this study  colors and evolution of mass - to - light ratios  are independent of the hubble constant .",

    "the primary dataset for this study is the goods public v1.0 data release ( giavalisco et  al .",
    "2004 ) which provides deep imaging in four acs passbands : f435w ( @xmath21 ) , f606w ( @xmath22 ) , f775w ( @xmath23 ) , and f850lp ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the depth and high resolution ( 003/pix sampling ) of the goods acs photometry , allow for an examination of the structure and luminosity parameters of spheroidal galaxies and , in particular , spiral galaxy bulges can be isolated from their surrounding disk .",
    "spectroscopic data is essential both for the photometric analysis where redshifts are required to create rest - frame properties , and for the fp analysis where precise bulge stellar velocity dispersions are required .",
    "spectroscopic data is drawn from two independent campaigns .",
    "the first is that of t05 , who secured high signal / noise spectra of a magnitude - limited sample of isolated spheroid - dominated galaxies in the northern goods field with @xmath24@xmath022.5 spanning the redshift range 0.1@xmath0@xmath10@xmath01.2 ( see figs .  1 & 2 of t05 for a mosaic of this sample ) .",
    "precision central stellar velocity dispersions were secured for 181 of these galaxies via 12 night exposures undertaken with deimos during 2003 april 15 at the keck observatory .",
    "the second component of our bulge sample arises from later keck campaigns during 2004 and 2005 dedicated to increasing the spiral sample for this project . here",
    ", we selected isolated spirals from the northern and southern goods fields according to visual classifications presented by bundy et  al .",
    "this sample was also limited at @xmath24@xmath022.5 with the additional criterion of a known spectroscopic redshift from the keck team redshift survey ( wirth et  al .",
    "this yielded a further target sample of 45 spirals within 0.1@xmath0@xmath10@xmath00.7 . a mosaic of 3-color acs images for this second subset is shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] .",
    "the two spectroscopic subsets are naturally somewhat different .",
    "the first , from t05 , is skewed to spheroid - dominated systems considered to be e / s0s in the originally - released v0.5 images .",
    "regardless of the original t - type classification ( see t05 for details ) , all galaxies in the combined sample were independently visually examined as part of this analysis , in order to determine whether they were better described by 1 ( pure spheroidal ) or 2-component ( spheroid plus disk ) systems .",
    "occasionally , particularly at high redshift , the visual inspection was not definitive .",
    "in such cases , the shape of the light profile was used as an additional guide by comparing one - component srsic  fits to b / d decompositions ( see  [ sec : bddecomps ] ) . the different fits and their residuals",
    "were compared to single versus two - component fits of the bona - fide spirals . since we only consider the radial component of the light profiles , the 25 high - inclination ( @xmath23@xmath870@xmath25 ) spirals in both samples",
    "are excluded from further analysis .",
    "furthermore , a kinematic decomposition into separate components for the observed central velocity dispersion is not feasible . we thus restrict ourselves to galaxies with bulge - to - total ratio ( @xmath2 ) greater than 0.2 for the fp analysis to ensure that the effects of disk contamination is minimal ( see   [ sec : sigmacor ] ) .",
    "this excludes a further 21 galaxies from the recent campaign , and 25 from t05 .    in summary , therefore , the _ photometric sample _ for this study comprises 193 galaxies in the redshift range 0.1@xmath0@xmath10@xmath01.2 of which 56 were modeled as single - component srsic  profiles and 137 were decomposed into two components : exponential disk plus srsic  bulge .",
    "the _ spectroscopic sample _ , from which the fp will be constructed , comprises 147 galaxies , 56 pure ( single - component ) spheroidals and the spheroidal component of 91 two - component galaxies .",
    "eight bulges are common to both spectroscopic sub - samples , thereby offering a check on systematic errors ( see   [ subsec : veldisp ] )",
    ". figure  [ fig : redshift ] shows a histogram of the redshift distributions for both the photometric and spectroscopic samples . finally ,",
    "table  [ tab : galpars ] lists positions , redshifts , t - type , number of fit components , @xmath2 , and total observed magnitudes ( see   [ sec : totmagcol ] ) for all of our sample galaxies .",
    "we begin with an examination of the deep acs images in the goods v1.0 data release to derive the structural and luminosity parameters of the spheroidal components ( defined here as the entire galaxy for single - component galaxies , or the isolated bulge for the two - component galaxies ) of the full photometric sample . a key goal is the comparison of the photometric properties of our bulges with the spheroidals analyzed by t05 .",
    "azimuthally - averaged surface brightness ( sb ) profiles are extracted from the @xmath10-band images using the xvista package .",
    "galaxy centers are determined interactively and fixed for the isophotal fit , but variable position angles ( pa ) and ellipticities ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the semi - major and semi - minor axes ) are permitted at each isophote .",
    "sb profiles are traced to @xmath92426 , corresponding to a systematic sb error of @xmath290.1 .",
    "profiles were extracted in at least @xmath10 & @xmath23 for each galaxy in our sample , and most @xmath10@xmath290.5 also have adequate @xmath22 & @xmath21 profiles .",
    "surface brightness profiles are modeled using techniques described in detail in macarthur , courteau , & holtzman ( 2003 , hereafter mac03 ) .",
    "a brief description is provided here .",
    "our profile modeling algorithm reduces one - dimensional ( 1d ) projected galaxy luminosity profiles into either a single component srsicprofile , or decomposes bulge and disk components simultaneously using a nonlinear levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit to the logarithmic intensities ( i.e.  magnitude units ) .",
    "random sb errors are accounted for in the ( data@xmath30model ) minimization , whereas systematic errors such as uncertainties in the sky background and point spread function measurements are accounted for separately by performing decompositions with the nominal values as well as @xmath14 their respective errors ( see   [ subsec : skysing ] ) .",
    "a fundamental aspect of the profile decompositions is the choice of fitting functions .",
    "the exponential nature of disk profiles has been established observationally both locally ( freeman 1970 ; kormendy 1977 ; de  jong 1996 ; mac03 ) , and at high-@xmath10 ( elmegreen et  al .",
    "hence , here we model the disk light , in magnitudes , as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 are the disk central surface brightness ( csb ) and scale length respectively , and @xmath34 is the galactocentric radius measured along the major axis .",
    "the appropriate form for spiral bulges and spheroidal galaxies is , however , less clear .",
    "historically , all spheroids were modeled with the de  vaucouleurs @xmath35 profile which has proven to be a good description for the shape of luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , higher resolution studies have revealed a range of profile shapes for both e / s0s and spiral bulges , which generally correlates with the luminosity ( caon et  al .",
    "1993 ; andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ; courteau et  al .",
    "1996 ; graham 2001 ; mac03 ) .",
    "such a range is also supported by numerical simulations of two component ( halo plus stars ) dissipationless collapse ( nipoti et  al .  2006 ) when mergers and secular evolution of disk material are accounted for ( scannapieco & tissera 2003 ; debattista et  al .",
    "2005 ) .    to ensure the most general form for the bulge sb profile , we adopt the formulation of srsic , which , in magnitudes , becomes : @xmath36},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the sb at the effective radius , @xmath38 , enclosing half the total extrapolated luminosity . ] , and @xmath39 is chosen to ensure that @xmath40    we use the approximation for @xmath39 given in appendix a of mac03 which is good to one part in 10@xmath41 for @xmath42@xmath30.36 and two parts in 10@xmath43 for @xmath42@xmath440.36 .",
    "it has become customary to express the disk parameters in terms of scale length and csb ( @xmath33 and @xmath45 ) , while the spheroid is described in terms of _ effective _ parameters ( @xmath38 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "we adopt this formalism , thus parameters with subscript `` @xmath47 '' refer to the bulge or spheroid .",
    "we will use a capital @xmath48 to indicate radii expressed in physical units ( usually kpc ) .    for the fundamental plane analysis in the following sections , we also need to compute the average sb within the effective radius . for the srsic  profile",
    "this is computed as : @xmath49 where @xmath50    the best - fit parameters of the ( data@xmath30model ) comparison are then those which minimize the reduced chi - square merit function , @xmath51 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where n is the number of radial data points used , m is the number free parameters ( i.e.  n  @xmath30  m = @xmath52 degrees of freedom ) , and @xmath53 is the statistical error at each sb level . from here on the @xmath54 subscript will be omitted and the @xmath55 variable refers to a @xmath55 per degree of freedom .",
    "constraining the five structural parameters of spiral galaxies is a challenge even at low - redshift . at higher-@xmath10 ,",
    "the lower ( relative ) resolution and depth limitations of the images renders the challenge even greater . in order to avoid discrepant fits between different passbands ,",
    "some workers have opted to perform fits simultaneously in all bands .",
    "the scale parameters are held fixed for the decompositions in all passbands , and only the flux levels are allowed to vary to obtain colors ( e.g.  koo05 ) .",
    "this procedure implies there are no significant color gradients and that the bulge shapes are identical at all wavelengths .",
    "however , just as any morphological description of galaxies ( e.g.  hubble types ) depends on the wave band , intrinsic structural parameters have also been shown to vary with wavelength as a result of stellar population and dust extinction effects ( e.g.  macarthur et  al .",
    "2004 , hereafter mac04 ) .",
    "thus , multi - wavelength information and independent fits at each wavelength are required for any accurate description of galactic structural parameters .",
    "an additional narrowing of the parameter space is often accomplished by fixing the bulge shape to be that of a de  vaucouleurs profile ( srsic  @xmath42=4 ) .",
    "while this may be justified for luminous spheroidal galaxies and earliest - type spiral bulges , our sample contains a range in spheroidal galaxy luminosity and extends to late - type spirals which have been shown to have bulge profiles closer to that of an exponential ( e.g.  mac03 ) , thus such a constraint would be inappropriate .",
    "physical differences in the shape and size of spheroids among galaxies are also expected depending on how they were formed .",
    "formation by dissipationless collapse ( nipoti et  al .",
    "2006 ) or accretion processes ( e.g. major / minor mergers ) can account for steeply rising ( high-@xmath42 ) light profiles in the central parts of galaxies ( e.g. aguerri et  al .",
    "2001 ) , while secular evolution of disk material ( possibly triggered by a satellite ) would yield shallower distributions ( @xmath42@xmath1212 ) of the central light ( scannapieco & tissera 2003 ; eliche - moral et  al .",
    "the formation of small bulges is indeed largely attributed to secular processes and redistribution of disk material ( see kormendy & kennicutt 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "an important constraint in analyzing our present dataset is the need to compare the evolutionary characteristics of our new bulge sample with a similar sample of e / s0s ( from t05 ) .",
    "ideally , the analysis techniques should be identical . in t05 ,",
    "structural homology was assumed and all profiles were modeled with a fixed @xmath42=4 profile , to conform with the standard practice for traditional studies of the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. dressler et  al .  1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; jrgensen et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "however , the goal of this paper is to extend the study to bulges , which are typically best modeled as lower @xmath42 srsicprofiles .",
    "thus , to ensure homogeneity between the analysis of bulges and spheroidals , we have re - modeled the light profiles of the t05 galaxies using srsic  profile for the spheroid component and adding a disk component when necessary .",
    "we find a range of best fit srsic  parameters for these early - type galaxies spanning @xmath90.9@xmath0@xmath42@xmath03.4 ( i.e.  it does not extend as high as the de  vaucouleurs @xmath42=4 shape , see panel ( d ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : corr_local ] ) .    the following sections detail the fitting techniques which are specific to our intermediate redshift sample and",
    "are based exclusively on results from 1d b / d decompositions .",
    "the fact that we do not attempt to model non - axisymmetric shapes ( bars , rings , oval distortions ) lessens the need for more computationally intensive 2d b / d decompositions ( extensive simulations in mac03 showed no improvements using the 2d over the 1d decomposition method when modeling axisymmetric structures . ) the measured parameters and correlations among them are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : corr ] .      in order to determine the range of best - fitted bulge and disk parameters , we need to assist the minimization program in finding the lowest possible ( data@xmath30model ) @xmath55  ( c.f .",
    "we base our initial estimates for the disk parameters @xmath33 and @xmath45 on a `` marking the disk '' technique , where the linear portion of a luminosity profile is `` marked '' and the selected range is fit using standard least squares techniques to determine its slope . the baseline adopted for these fits is 0.25@xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the inner boundary is chosen to exclude the major contribution of a putative bulge or a freeman ( 1970 ) type - ii profile dip , and @xmath57 is the radius at which the surface brightness error is greater than 0.1 .",
    "flexibility in the _ bulge _ initial parameters is , however , limited by point spread function and sampling effects ; thus the srsic  @xmath42 exponent can not be fit as a free parameter .",
    "we therefore hold @xmath42 fixed in the decompositions and explore the full range of 0.1@xmath0@xmath42@xmath06.0 in steps of @xmath42@xmath580.1 .",
    "a grid search is performed to select the best fit .",
    "as in mac03 , for each decomposition ( at fixed @xmath42 ) we explore four different sets of initial bulge parameter estimates to protect against local minima in the parameter space .",
    "bulges of late - type spirals are small and their luminosity profiles can be severely affected by the point spread function ( psf ) . the psf is accounted for by convolving the model light profiles with a radially - symmetric gaussian psf prior to comparison with the observed profile .",
    "the psfs in the goods acs images were estimated using a modified version of the tiny tim _ hst _ psf modeling software ( rhodes et  al.2007 ) .",
    "for each of the 4 goods filters , 2500 artificial stars were inserted across the acs wfc field with a telescope focus value of @xmath59 m",
    "( i.e.  a primary / secondary spacing 2@xmath60 m smaller than nominal ) .",

    "table  [ tab : acs ] lists the mean and standard deviation of the 2500 psf measurements for each of the 4 acs filters . to account for the spread in these psf distributions ,",
    "each profile is modeled with three different values of the psf fwhm : the nominal mean value and @xmath145% of that value .",
    "the goods acs images are already sky subtracted , so no further attempt at measuring a residual sky was made .",
    "however , we do allow for sky subtraction errors in the decompositions , in a similar manner as the psf errors , by using three different sky levels : the measured profile as is and at @xmath140.5% of a nominal space - based value for each band .",
    "the adopted sky levels are listed in table  [ tab : acs ] .",
    "the final step is to determine the best fit from the resulting 2160 decompositions .",
    "we follow mac03 ( @xmath614.3 ) and undertake a grid search for the minimum of two @xmath55   merit function distributions ; the global @xmath55 ( eq .  [ [ eq : chi ] ] ) which is dominated by the contribution from the disk , and a separate _ inner _ @xmath55 statistic computed to twice the radius where the bulge and disk contribute equally to the total luminosity ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we label this statistic as @xmath63 . for cases where the bulges are so small that they never truly dominate the light profile ( i.e.  @xmath64 is undefined ) ,",
    "we compute @xmath63  out to the radius at which @xmath54=1 . only the global @xmath55  is considered for single component",

    "constraints were placed based on the @xmath23 and @xmath10-band fits ( where the sb profiles are closest to rest - frame @xmath65-band ) .",
    "these physical constraints are rather generous and do not contribute any subjective bias .",
    "figure  [ fig : bddecomps ] shows an example of the best fit profiles and the fit residuals derived for all four bands of the @xmath10=0.512 spiral galaxy g928 .",
    "the five structural fit parameters are shown in the upper right corner , the bottom two panels show the run of ellipticity and position angle from the isophotal fits .",
    "note that these are the same for all four bands as the @xmath10-band fits are used for the profile extraction of the other 3 bands .",
    "a key goal of our study is construction of the color - redshift relation for bulges in our sample .",
    "we will thus explore in detail the relationship between the colors of the spheroidal component and those determined using apertures .",
    "we likewise wish to derive integrated magnitudes so that we can more accurately determine the bulge / total ratios implied by our photometric analysis .",
    "magnitudes computed involving extrapolations will be highly sensitive to the actual profile shape . for example , outer disk ( anti-)truncations which are often observed in spiral galaxies would not be accounted for with a single exponential disk fit .",
    "we thus compute total galaxy magnitudes from the photometry to the maximum observed radius with the addition of the extrapolation of a linear fit to the outer 20% of the profile .",
    "the extrapolation typically increases the magnitude by @xmath120.1 mag , except when the profile is very shallow . in cases where the extrapolation adds more than 0.5 mag ,",
    "the galaxy is tagged and the tabulated error is increased accordingly .",
    "we correct total magnitudes for ( small ) galactic foreground extinction using the reddening values , @xmath66 , of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and interpolating to the effective wavelength of the goods - acs filters .",
    "the adopted values for both the northern and southern fields are listed in table  [ tab : acs ] .",
    "similarly , the contribution to the total light at large radii ( i.e.   extrapolated to infinity ) in the srsic  profile changes significantly as a function of @xmath42 ( see fig .  2 of mac03 ) , thus a small error on the fitted @xmath42 could lead to an error in the total magnitude . while this error will typically not be significant for the total spheroid magnitude",
    ", the relative differences between passbands can propagate to large errors on the colors whose dynamical ranges are small ( of order @xmath91.5  mag for rest - frame @xmath67 and smaller for shorter wavelength baselines ) . to minimize the potentially large errors due to extrapolation , while still allowing for color gradients , we compute the colors of our fitted spheroids using the best fit model parameters , but only integrating out to the radius corresponding to the best fit @xmath38 in the @xmath10-band",
    ". these colors should be equivalent to aperture colors within 1@xmath68 for the single component galaxies , but can differ significantly from aperture colors for spiral bulges as they account for the ( differential ) contamination from disk light .",
    "bulge - to - total ( @xmath2 ) luminosity ratios can be computed either from the fits alone , or as a combination of the bulge fit and the ( nearly ) non - parametrically measured galaxy magnitude discussed above .",

    "this also complies with the observation that both des and small bulges are more supported by rotation than their larger counterparts .",
    "the temptation to interpret the kormendy relation as an evolutionary diagram or an indication of different formation mechanisms , however , has been disregarded due to the mixture between different types , and the changes in the profile shapes discussed above .",
    "prior to our photometric analysis below , we summarize in table  [ tab : photpars ] our derived photometric parameters for the spheroidal components of our sample galaxies .",
    "we now turn to the first component of the analysis of our dataset which is concerned with addressing the photometric evolution of our intermediate redshift bulges .",
    "both ead and koo05 presented color - redshift diagrams but using different analysis methods and different sample selection criteria . perhaps as a result of this , they arrived at rather different conclusions .",
    "our goal is to understand the source of any discrepancy as well as to intercompare the various approaches .",
    "the dispersion in color at a given redshift is an important indicator of the diversity of the bulge population and hence the likelihood of continued star formation and mass assembly .",
    "moreover , a comparison with similar data for low luminosity spheroidal galaxies will give an indication of the extent to which growth is primarily driven by processes internal to spiral galaxies .",
    "ead based their analysis on aperture colors ( within a fixed size of 5% relative to the isophotal radius ) and found that their bulges displayed a large scatter toward the blue in observed @xmath80 , with few being as red as e / s0 counterparts at a given redshift .",
    "they concluded that bulges underwent recent periods of growth and associated rejuvenation .",
    "however , it is possible that the blueward scatter arises , in part , from disk contamination .",
    "as we have undertaken careful decomposition of the light profiles with the improved acs data , here we examine the equivalent color trends with redshift for our sample .",
    "bulge colors computed from b / d decompositions are extremely sensitive to the fits themselves . to understand some of these effects , and to calibrate some of the contamination that might have affected the ead analysis , in figure  [ fig : apmag ] we compare our fitted bulge @xmath81 colors ( measured out to 1@xmath38 ) to the central 03 aperture colors [ _ left panel _ ] and those of the total galaxy [ _ right panel _ ] .",
    "the acs psf is @xmath29009 , so the 03 aperture colors should not be seriously affected by psf mismatch between bands ( which are @xmath82(psf ) @xmath290008 ) .",
    "bulge fits are not shown if the fit magnitudes in either band were fainter than 30mags ( as these galaxies are fundamentally bulgeless ) .",
    "the fit and aperture @xmath81 colors are very similar , but there is some scatter such that the model fit colors are often somewhat redder than the aperture colors , particularly for galaxies that have a disk component ( squares , stars , and asterisks ) .",
    "this probably arises from ( bluer ) disk contamination within the aperture .",
    "the fit colors are also often redder than the total galaxy , consistent with negative ( bluing outward ) gradients .",
    "nonetheless , the above comparison confirms that our photometric decomposition is stable and yields reasonably - consistent bulge colors .",
    "we now return to the redshift dependence of our observed spheroidal component colors .",
    "figure  [ fig : imzz ] plots the observed @xmath81 colors as a function of redshift .",
    "the black lines represent model tracks of a passively - evolving single burst population for three formation redshifts ( @xmath7=@xmath83 ) and three metallicities ( @xmath84=@xmath85 ) .",
    "all stellar population models considered are those of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) .",
    "the dash - dotted cyan line is a @xmath7=3 model with solar metallicity that has extinction included using the dust models of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) with @xmath86=2 ( corresponding to an @xmath87@xmath91.5 ) .    as observed by many authors ( e.g.  t05 ) , most of the elliptical ( i.e.  single component ) galaxies ( circles ) are consistent with a single burst model with @xmath7@xmath123 .",
    "those es which deviate from this trend , indicating a more recent formation / activity , tend to be the lower - luminosity systems ( as indicated by the point size ) .",
    "many of the two - component galaxies ( squares , stars , and asterisks ) also follow this trend , but a more significant number scatter strongly to the blue and a few lie redwards of the dust - free models ( even if a very high metallicity is assumed ) .",
    "the latter may arise from dust extinction , but the large scatter to the blue is consistent with the observations of ead ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . however , unlike ead we do see a number of bulges that are just as red as the e / s0s .",
    "these could represent the red bulges observed by koo05 and , indeed , if a similar cut is made on the observed @xmath23-band bulge magnitude as that of koo05 , the remaining spheroids in the same redshift range ( @xmath10@xmath90.8 ) are red and consistent with old single - burst populations .",
    "thus it seems that there is no real disagreement between the studies of ead and koo05 .",
    "while there are differences in their analysis techniques , our own internal tests suggest these are unlikely to be significant to a level that could cause such a discrepancy (   [ sec : apmags ] ) .",
    "the fundamental difference is in the respective bulge samples : ead sampled bulges drawn from a full range of hubble types with the morphologically - classed spirals likely skewed towards later - type bulges .",
    "koo05 selected bulges only from the bright end of the bulge luminosity function which , according to figure  [ fig : imzz ] , are predominantly red and passively - evolving .",
    "spheroid color ( measured to @xmath88 from the light profile modeling ) versus redshift .",
    "point types and colors are indicated in upper left and the point size is proportional to the rest - frame @xmath21 magnitude of the spheroidal component .",
    "the black lines represent bc03 models of single burst stellar populations ( ssps ) formed at three redshifts ( @xmath7=0.5,1,3 ) that evolve passively .",
    "ssps for three metallicities are shown ( @xmath84=0.0004 , 0.02 , & 0.05 , where @xmath89=0.02 ) .",
    "the cyan dashed - dotted line is a @xmath7=3 model with solar metallicity that has extinction included using the dust models of charlot & fall ( 2000 ) and @xmath86=2 .",
    "the average error is shown as the error bar [ _ bottom left corner _ ] .",
    "[ fig : imzz],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in summary , therefore , our results confirm the diversity of bulge colors at intermediate redshift originally identified by ead , although the bulk of the more luminous systems more closely track the relationship defined by the larger spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the question thus arises whether we are looking at two different populations each following a distinct formation path , or rather a more continuous mode of assembly for the spheroidal components where , for example , additional growth is occurring but it has proportionally less effect for the more massive systems .",
    "phrased another way , we can ask whether the spheroidal components of all galaxies ( spirals , s0s , and es ) _ at a given mass _ are consistent in terms of their evolutionary paths .",
    "it is hard to address such a question from colors alone as the bulge luminosity or @xmath2 ratio represent poor proxies for the mass of the system . to address this more fundamental question we now turn to considering the combined set of dynamical and photometric information for our sample . by constructing the fundamental plane for a subset of our bulge components and comparing the relation to that",
    "now well - mapped for spheroidal galaxies of various masses ( t05 ) , we can more accurately determine the mass growth rate of luminous bulges .",

    "[ sec : photom ] , enable us to construct the fp for the spheroidal components of e , s0 , and spiral galaxies and to compare their recent stellar mass growth rates .",
    "as discussed earlier , the spectroscopic data were taken in two distinct campaigns .",
    "the first is that described in detail in t05 , relating to both e / s0s and bulge - dominated spirals .",

    "we detail below our methodology for deriving these dispersions .",
    "the velocity dispersion and rotation profiles of our spectra were measured using the well - tested gauss - hermite pixel fitting algorithm provided by van  der  marel ( 1994)marel / software/ ] .",
    "prior to analysis , the 1d galaxy and template spectra are matched in rest - frame wavelength range and re - binned onto a logarithmic wavelength scale .",
    "after convolving a suitable template spectrum with gaussian velocity profiles of various dispersions , the best - fitting dispersion for each template is found ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kinem ] [ _ middle panels _ ] ) .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is measured via the @xmath55  statistic , weighted by the observational errors .",
    "the parameters determined for a given spectrum include the model - to - galaxy relative line strength ( @xmath98 ) , the mean velocity ( @xmath99 ) , the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath100 ) , and their respective errors .",
    "an advantage of the pixel fitting technique is the ability to mask , via zero weighting , undesirable regions of the spectrum , for example those containing emission lines , gaps between ccds , and atmospheric features .",
    "ideally , the template spectra should be an excellent match to the spheroid stellar population ( gonzlez 1993 ) . from our previous analysis of goods",
    "e / s0s ( t05 ) , we have an appropriate set of high - resolution stellar templates that range from spectral types g0iii to k5iii . recognizing that one of the goals of this study is to address the conjecture that bulges contain younger stellar populations , potentially spanning a range of metallicities , in addition to the observed red giant templates , we also include a selection of 36 templates from the high - resolution synthetic spectra of coelho et  al .",

    "the best - fit template is selected primarily on the @xmath55  figure of merit , but some weight is given to the line - strength parameter @xmath98 ( which should equal unity for a perfect spectral match between galaxy and template ) and the formal error of the fit parameters .",
    "indeed , in many cases , the bulge spectra are best matched by the `` younger '' model template spectra .    out of 45 spiral bulges observed in this",
    "second observing campaign , successful central dispersions were obtained for 23 galaxies .",
    "7 had marginal measurements , 13 failed to yield dispersions , and 2 had corrupt spectra .",
    "of the 23 galaxies with successful @xmath97 measurements , only 8 had @xmath2@xmath30.2 and thus could be included in our fp sample .",
    "the velocity dispersion fits for these 8 galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : kinem ] [ _ middle panels _ ] .    finally , of the 8 galaxies observed in common in both campaigns , 5 had successful @xmath100 measurements in both and",
    "can be compared as a consistency check .",
    "four of the galaxies had @xmath104@xmath00.08 with no systematic trend . the fifth galaxy ( g928 ) had @xmath104=0.54 , but this is not surprising nor worrisome , given that the spectrum is dominated by young stellar populations and emission lines , while the measurement procedure in t05 was only appropriate for older stellar populations , starting with the choice of red giant stellar templates .",
    "we thus conclude that the measurements are consistent within the error bars , when they are comparable .",
    "disk contamination could potentially present a source of uncertainty when interpreting the central velocity dispersions for these spiral galaxies as representative of the bulge component .",
    "in addition to template mismatch biases , even a modest systematic rotation might lead to an overestimated value for the smaller bulges .",
    "the spatial resolution of the observations are limited by the pixel scale ( 01185 per pixel ) , the physical size of the slit width ( 1 ) and the typical seeing fwhm during the time of the observations ( @xmath90.81 ) . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we have limited our bulge sample to those with @xmath2@xmath30.2 to ensure that the bulge light dominates in the center .",
    "however , the presence of a disk could still influence the measurement and interpretation of @xmath97 .    a proper kinematic decomposition of our data into contributions from the bulge , disk , and dark halo components would require full dynamical modeling ( see widrow & dubinsky 2005 ) .",
    "conceivably this could be possible for a few galaxies where we have adequately sampled kinematic profiles , but is beyond the scope of the current analysis .",
    "our main goal is therefore to estimate the likely degree to which disk light is influencing our measurements .    for those spectra where resolved kinematic data can be extracted ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kinem ] [ _ right panels _ ] ) , we can attempt to estimate the disk contribution to the true bulge dispersion , @xmath105 from the rotation measured across the bulge ( assuming this arises entirely from disk component ) .",
    "we model this as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the velocity at 1@xmath38 or at a radius of 2 pixels ( at 0.1185/pix ) , whichever was larger .",
    "the velocity was typically very small , with the correction factor @xmath108 ranging from 0.71 , with a mean value of 0.95 .",
    "we can also monitor the possible effects of disk contamination in the bulge spectra by considering the inner dispersion gradients .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : kinem ] [ _ right panels _ ] reveals that the @xmath109 profiles are largely flat within the central regions ( @xmath291@xmath38 ) .",
    "although we do not have kinematic profiles for all galaxies , given the bulk have near face - on inclinations , we conclude contamination by a rotating disk component is not significant .    finally , we need to standardize the aperture within which the dispersion measurement refers .",
    "several studies have considered @xmath100 gradients in early - type galaxies and find @xmath110 with @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( e.g.  jrgensen , franx , & kjaergaard 1996 , cappellari et  al .",
    "2006 ) . for our observations",
    ", we have a fixed slit - width of 1 , the deimos scale is 0.1185  per pixel , and the effective radii of our galaxies range from 01 , with an average value of 03 . as a result , although our extracted central spectrum will be dominated by the highest sb central portion , there will be some contribution from beyond 12@xmath38 . adopting an observed effective aperture of 035 , the average correction to an @xmath113 aperture using @xmath114 is @xmath115 , where we have chosen the standard correction to an aperture of @xmath116 for comparison of our results with other studies .",
    "adopting @xmath117 would reduce the correction factor to 1.10 .",
    "our correction takes into account the measured @xmath38 , which has the drawback of correlating @xmath100 and @xmath38 , but is important given the wide range of spheroid sizes in our sample relative to the constant effective aperture of our observations .",
    "we now use the derived photometric and kinematic parameters to construct the fundamental plane ( fp ) for our intermediate-@xmath10 sample of the spheroidal components of galaxies with @xmath118 .",
    "the fp is traditionally expressed in terms of galaxy effective radius , @xmath48 , the average surface brightness within the effective radius , sbe , and the central velocity dispersion , @xmath97 ( e.g.  dressler et  al.1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , related via : @xmath119 with @xmath48 in units of kpc , sbe in , and @xmath97 in km  s@xmath20 .    in order to address the evolutionary history of mass build - up in galaxies ,",
    "it is necessary to convert these measured parameters into masses and mass - to - light ( @xmath16 ) ratios .",

    "however , in the case of varying @xmath42 , the profile shape does affect the measured @xmath16 through a variation in the velocity dispersion profile ( even though these changes in profile shape do not significantly alter the fp or its tilt , see fig .",

    "[ fig : fpev5 ] we show the location of our spheroids in the face - on projection of the fp plane according to the j96 local relation for coma .",
    "we divide the sample into five redshift bins ( with constant @xmath128 , thus some additional scatter is expected due to the different age ranges in the different bins ) .",
    "the most notable trend is that with redshift . as redshift increases , bulges and spheroids alike move further away from the local relation .",
    "this is consistent with the trend noted previously for spheroids and can be qualitatively understood in terms of the reduced age of the stellar populations . as cosmic time goes by , stars are on average older , and thus for a given size and velocity dispersion the surface brightness is lower .",
    "it is important to keep in mind when comparing with previous studies of spheroids ( such as t05 ) that we have isolated the spheroidal component from the surrounding disk , when present . as a result",
    ", galaxies in common with t05 have generally moved downwards in size ( and in luminosity ) . as expected , the scatter for the spiral bulges is reduced with respect to t05 , because we have taken care of separating the pressure supported component from the rotation supported disk .    looking at the trends inside each bin , the overall effect seems to imply a continuation in the fp space from the higher mass ( e / s0 ) to the lower mass ( bulge ) spheroids .",
    "also , the fp at intermediate redshift appears to be tilted with respect to the local relation .",
    "the evolution of the tilt seems to be less pronounced than that observed for spheroids considered as a single component .",
    "a confirmation and quantification of this trend awaits a larger sample .",
    "finally , we note that many of the smallest bulges appear to lie too far to the right of the relation defined by the bigger spheroids .",
    "while this effect could be real , we speculate that this is due to the fact that , in the case of two - component galaxies , our central velocity dispersions are sensitive to the potential from the total galaxy ( bulge / disk / halo ) and thus are overestimates of the `` bulge - only '' dispersions .",
    "this could be a partial explanation for the above mentioned apparent weaker fp tilt evolution in comparison with the pure spheroids .",
    "-1.5 in       we now use equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) to derive masses for our spheroids and test some of the conjectures above of a correlation between evolutionary state with spheroid mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : mlm ] we plot the rest - frame @xmath21-band mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath129 ; note the inverted scale on the y - axis ) as a function of mass ( both expressed in solar units ) , separated into the same redshift bins as in figure  [ fig : fpev5 ] .",

    "the shaded areas indicate the selection limits due to our total galaxy magnitude limit of @xmath24@xmath022.5 mag .",
    "the more densely hatched regions correspond to the lower limit of the redshift bin , while the sparsely hatched regions are for the upper redshift limit .",
    "the gray hatches apply to the pure spheroidal galaxies and the black hatches regions are the corresponding @xmath24@xmath024.25 limit for the two - component galaxy sample ( i.e.  according to our @xmath2@xmath30.2 limit ) .",
    "this selection limit imposes some restrictions on our interpretation of evolution , particularly at the highest - redshift and low - mass ends .",
    "several trends are noticeable upon examination of figure  [ fig : mlm ] .",
    "first , the slope of our relation is somewhat steeper than the local relation slope , and there is some indication that the steepening increases with redshift ( although the latter is not conclusive due to our selection limits ) . broadly speaking",
    ", it appears that the bulges follow a similar relation to that defined by the pure spheroidal galaxies .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence of an offset to lower @xmath16 ratios ( due to increased @xmath21-band luminosity ) which may be expected if the bulges are undergoing a more continuous mode of sf , as is expected in the secular formation scenario ( e.g.  kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "if anything , some bulges are offset to higher @xmath16 . however , as mentioned above we believe this could be due to the fact that our central velocity dispersions are sensitive to the total galaxy potential , but our derived masses are based on a formulation for the total mass of a single srsic  profile .",
    "we may , therefore , be overestimating the mass of the spheroid for multiple - component systems .",
    "the effect does appear to be stronger for the lower @xmath2 bulges , thus strengthening the support for this hypothesis .",
    "-1.5 in     also evident in figure  [ fig : mlm ] is that the deviation from the local relation increases as the spheroid mass decreases .",
    "we can represent this offset directly using equation  ( [ eq : dml ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : dml ] which plots @xmath130 as a function of redshift and divided into three spheroid mass bins .",
    "this representation can be easily interpreted in terms of star formation histories in an analogous procedure to that presented in t05 ( their fig .",
    "overplotted on figure  [ fig : dml ] are @xmath16 evolution models from bc03 .",
    "the gray lines represent a single burst of star formation at @xmath7=5 that evolves passively .",
    "the most massive spheroids ( including e / s0s and bulges ) in the @xmath13111.5 bin are well described by this old population formed in a single burst . in the lower mass bins , however ,",
    "many galaxies deviate significantly from this relation .",
    "these deviations can be explained in the context of more recent spheroid building in the form of subsequent bursts of star formation on top of an underlying old population , where the old population dominates the total stellar mass .",
    "the black lines in the two lower mass bins represent the @xmath16 evolution for such models . for the intermediate mass range ( 11.5@xmath73@xmath132@xmath011.0 ) , the data are consistent with a more recent burst of sf that represents @xmath95% of the total stellar mass , and in the lowest mass bin , recent bursts involving @xmath910% of the total mass are required . due to the short timescales of the initial @xmath16 decline after a burst of sf ,",
    "these mass fractions are likely underestimates .",
    "these results echo those found in t05 for e / s0s .    of particular note here",
    "is that the distribution of bulges in the representation shown in figure  [ fig : dml ] is largely indistinguishable from that of the pure spheroidal galaxies .",
    "thus , we conclude that , for host systems with @xmath2@xmath30.2 , all spheroids _ at a given mass _ appear to follow the same evolutionary path .",
    "the smaller mass spheroids  whether isolated or embedded in a disk  must have more recent stellar mass growth , so the recent observations of galaxy `` downsizing '' in spheroidal galaxies , both empirically ( e.g.  bundy et  al .",
    "2005 ; t05 ; di serego alighieri et  al .   2005 ;",
    "van  der  wel et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and in cosmological n - body + semi - analytical simulations ( de  lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ) , extends to the bulges of spiral galaxies .          before proceeding to a comparison of our results with other studies in the literature and to a physical interpretation of our spectroscopic and photometric results in the next section ,",
    "it is important to list a number of caveats that should be kept in mind throughout the discussion .",
    "* most local fp comparisons are not measured in quite the same way as our distant sample .",
    "for example , @xmath38 is typically not computed from srsic  fits , nor are two component fits generally applied to lenticular galaxies .",
    "this may introduce some systematic bias in our determination of the evolution of the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "for example , if the slope is steeper locally than we estimate , the deviations in figure  [ fig : dml ] will be tempered , and vice versa .",
    "we partially addressed this issue by compiling the fp of virgo galaxies based on srsic  fits ( ferrarese et  al .",
    "2006 ) . however , the virgo sample is small ( smaller in number than the intermediate redshift sample ! ) and lenticular galaxies are not decomposed into their spheroidal and disk constituents .",
    "our ongoing palomar program will hopefully provide us with a more suitable local comparison sample in the near future . * our @xmath133 ( or @xmath134 ) measurement is going to be sensitive to the total galaxy potential ( bulge + disk + halo ) , so the bulge mass may be systematically over - estimated the less prominent the bulge becomes .",
    "this could help explain the high @xmath16 ratios measured for our bulges , which appears to be more pronounced for the low @xmath2 systems , as expected .",
    "although this is beyond the scope of the present observational work , multicomponent dynamical models are needed to determine a more accurate mapping between measured @xmath97 effective radius , and _ bulge _ stellar mass for low-@xmath2 systems .",
    "* significant amounts of dust could also bias high our @xmath16 ratios .",
    "if present , one would expect it to be more of an issue the later the hubble type , and therefore dust could also explain in part the high @xmath16 ratios found for low-@xmath2 systems .",
    "a simple way to check for the presence of dust is to study evolutionary trends as a function of inclination .",
    "unfortunately the present sample is too small to be divided up in bins of the relevant controlling parameters , hubble type , redshift , inclination and mass . *",
    "the main limiting factor of our study is sample size .",
    "while collecting data for hundreds of spheroids has been a major effort and represents significant progress with respect to earlier work , in order to detect conclusive trends and address the caveats listed in this section , larger samples are needed at each redshift bin , covering wider  and overlapping across bins  ranges in mass ( and luminosity ) and hubble type .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend the samples to smaller bulges to verify how far down the mass function the downsizing trend extends .",
    "having discussed our photometric and spectroscopic results separately in sections 4 & 5 , we are now in a position to combine the inferences from the two diagnostics , compare them with previous studies in the literature , and discuss the physical interpretation .",
    "colors and mass - to - light ratios provide a consistent picture .",
    "the stellar populations of the most massive bulges are homogeneously old ( formed at @xmath10@xmath323 ) , while an increasingly larger fraction of younger stars ( formed below @xmath10@xmath91 ) is required as one moves down the mass function .",
    "this `` downsizing '' trend is consistent within the errors with that observed for the pure spheroidals and for the spheroidal component of lenticular galaxies . as discussed earlier , this finding allows us to reconcile the results of previous studies of intermediate redshift bulges based on wfpc2 data ( ead and koo05 ) .",
    "the results of our study are also consistent with recent studies of the `` fossil record '' from local samples .",
    "recently  based on the analysis of absorption features  thomas & davies ( 2006 ) found that , at a given velocity dispersion , local bulges are indistinguishable from elliptical galaxies in terms of their correlations with age and alpha - element enhancement ratios ( as a proxy for star formation timescales ) .",
    "their sample is similarly limited to large @xmath2 spirals .",
    "what does this all imply about bulge formation ?",
    "it is important to emphasize that different scenarios could lead to the same star formation history .",
    "for example , for the most massive spheroids analyzed in t05 , one can not distinguish based on stellar populations alone whether the mass assembly happened at high redshift , perhaps concurrent with the major episode of star formation , or whether they were assembled at a later time via dry mergers ( e.g.  van  dokkum 2005 ; bell et  al .",
    "independent data , such as those on the evolution of the stellar and dynamical mass functions ( e.g.  bundy , treu & ellis 2007 ) , are needed to break the degeneracy and conclude that the _ assembly _ happened at high redshift as well . for the less massive spheroids ,",
    "a larger amount of recent star formation is required , but understanding whether this happened in situ or via the accretion of gas reach satellites of mass of order a few @xmath135@xmath6 ( e.g.  t05 ) , again requires external information .",
    "the study by bundy treu & ellis ( 2007 ) , points toward minor mergers or internal / secular process as being important alongside major mergers .",
    "as far as bulges are concerned then , the similarity in star formation need not necessarily reflect a similarity in mechanisms / timing of assembly . at the high mass end ,",
    "the homogeneously old stellar populations of bulges seem hard to reconcile with recent formation from existing disk stars or gas .",
    "therefore it appears that we can safely conclude that massive bulges have been _ in place _",
    "well before the redshift range probed by this study , all but ruling out significant secular evolution ( see also thomas & davies 2006 ) . hence the similarity with spheroids for the most massive bulges appears to be both in the star formation history and in the mass assembly history .    at lower masses , secular process may become more important and it is difficult to disentangle recent in situ star formation , mass transfer from the disk to the bulge , and merging with satellites .",
    "external evidence suggests that at this redshift and mass scale , bulges are growing significantly via mergers ( woo et  al .",
    "2006 ; treu et  al .",
    "2007 ) , although this may not be the only evolutionary mechanism .",
    "if bulges at masses below @xmath5@xmath6 grow by mergers , than the rightmost plot in figure  [ fig : dml ] must be interpreted with caution : galaxies of a given mass at one redshift are not the progenitors of objects with the same mass at a lower redshift . perhaps a way to identify the spheroid progenitors is to study bulges at fixed central black hole mass , assuming that growth by accretion is mostly negligible .",
    "this is difficult to do in practice and is limited at intermediate redshifts to samples of spheroids hosting active nuclei .",
    "however  albeit with large uncertainties  such an exercise ( treu et  al .  2007 ) suggests that spheroids of a few @xmath136@xmath6 may grow in stellar mass by @xmath137dex in the past four billion years , while keeping the stellar mass - to - light ratio approximately constant as a result of adding young stars to an aging resident population .",
    "the uncertainties are currently too large and the samples too small to perform a quantitative test of this scenario , but it is clear that the evolution of spheroids in this mass range is not purely passive ( see also hopkins et  al .",
    "2006 ) and that complementary information from stellar populations studies , spheroid demographics , and scaling relations between host galaxy and central black hole are needed to disentangle star formation , assembly history and black hole growth and feedback .",
    "the line of studies presented in this work is crucial to accurately pinpoint the star formation history and could in future provide additional independent information if extended to include tracers of chemical enrichment .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of field galactic bulges , and of a comparison sample of lenticular and elliptical galaxies , in the redshift range @xmath10=0.11.2 .",
    "the galaxies are selected from the goods survey based on visual classification and luminosity ( @xmath24@xmath022.5 ) .",
    "we measure accurate colors and structural parameters for 193 galaxies , fitting two components ( bulge and disk ) for 137 galaxies and a single srsic  profile for the remaining 56 , classified as pure spheroids .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions are measured from deep spectroscopic observations using deimos on the keck - ii telescope . by combining new observations with the measurements derived in t05",
    ", we compile a spectroscopic subsample of 147 galaxies suitable for fundamental plane analysis , i.e.  reliable stellar velocity dispersion and bulge to total luminosity ratio greater than 20% , to minimize disk contamination .",
    "the spectroscopic subsample includes 56 one component galaxies ( pure spheroids ) and 91 two component ( bulge + disk ) galaxies .",
    "we use the two complementary diagnostics  colors and mass - to - light ratios as determined from the evolution of the fundamental plane  to derive the star formation history of bulges and compare it to that of the spheroidal component of lenticular galaxies and of elliptical galaxies .",
    "although the uncertainties are larger for bulges than for pure spheroids (   [ ssec : cavecanem ] )  and more data both at intermediate redshift and in the local universe are needed to confirm the trends , the two diagnostics give consistent results that can be summarized as follows :    * the stellar populations of the more massive bulges ( @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5@xmath6 ) are homogeneously old , consistent with a single major burst of star formation at redshift @xmath92 or higher , and only minor episodes of star formation below @xmath10@xmath91 ( @xmath295% in mass ) . * the colors and mass - to - light ratios of smaller bulges ( @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5@xmath6 ) span a wider range , consistent with an increasing fraction of younger stars going to smaller masses ( @xmath910% in mass ) .",
    "* the assembly history of bulges is consistent within the error with that of the spheroidal component of lenticular and elliptical galaxies of comparable mass .",
    "our detection of a mass dependent star formation history allows us to reconcile the findings of two earlier studies of intermediate redshift bulges based on wfpc2 data ( ead and koo05 ) .",
    "the more massive bulges are as old and red as massive spheroids , but smaller bulges have quite diverse star formation histories , with significant star formation below @xmath10@xmath91 .    the similarity between the mass assembly history of massive bulges and that of spheroids appears quite naturally explained in a scenario where the former are assembled at high redshift , rather than recently via secular process within spiral galaxies . at the lower mass end of our sample ( @xmath4@xmath9@xmath136@xmath6 ) ,",
    "the evolution of bulges below @xmath10@xmath91 becomes much more diverse , requiring perhaps a combination of merging and secular processes as observed for spheroids of similar mass ( bundy , treu , & ellis 2007 ) .",

    "the j96 relation is thus not appropriate as a local comparison relation here .",

    "<S> we report on the first results of a new study aimed at understanding the diversity and evolutionary history of distant galactic bulges in the context of now well - established trends for pure spheroidal galaxies . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , bulges have been isolated for a sample of 137 spiral galaxies within the redshift range 0.1@xmath0z@xmath11.2 in the goods fields . </S>",
    "<S> using proven photometric techniques we determine the characteristic parameters ( size , surface brightness , profile shape ) of both the disk and bulge components in our sample . in agreement with earlier work which utilized aperture colors , </S>",
    "<S> distant bulges show a broader range of optical colors than would be the case for passively - evolving populations . </S>",
    "<S> to quantify the amount of recent star formation necessary to explain this result , we used the deimos spectrograph to secure stellar velocity dispersions for a sizeable fraction of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> this has enabled us to compare the fundamental plane of our distant bulges with that for spheroidal galaxies in a similar redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> bulges of spiral galaxies with a bulge - to - total luminosity ratio ( @xmath2)@xmath30.2 show very similar patterns of evolution to those seen for pure spheroidals such that the stellar populations of all spheroids with @xmath4@xmath3@xmath5@xmath6 are homogeneously old , consistent with a single major burst of star formation at high redshift ( @xmath7@xmath82 ) , while bulges with @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5@xmath6 must have had more recent stellar mass growth ( @xmath910% in mass since @xmath10@xmath91 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although further data spanning a wider range of redshift and mass is desirable , the striking similarity between the assembly histories of bulges and low mass spheroidals is difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby the majority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiral galaxies . </S>"
