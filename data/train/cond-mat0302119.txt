    "it is well known that the integer values taken by the hall conductivity can be explained and understood by using some topological arguments @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the kubo formula used to compute this hall conductivity can be written into an explicit form in which the integral of the first chern class of a certain line vector bundle appears @xcite .",
    "these topological arguments are relevant because one can introduce or recognize two extra parameters into the quantum mechanical description of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , which are subject to a specific periodic condition .",
    "recall that the first indication in this direction was presented by laughlin @xcite where however only one parameter ( in the cylindrical geometry of @xcite ) was involved .",
    "while the above topological based results are esthetically appealing , all the models presented so far have not been able to really predict the value of the hall conductivity starting from some basic ingredients stemming from quantum mechanic .",
    "one reason for this may be due to the fact that the line vector bundle underlying those approaches did not take sufficiently into account the physical parameters of the experiment , that is the perpendicular applied magnetic field , the number of electrons involved in the phenomena , the shape of the sample , the nature of the threads ,     besides , many of the models for the qhe proposed so far have been based on some assumptions concerning the characteristics of the experiment which sometime do not fit quite well with the actual experimental situation . for instance , some of these models consider torus @xcite or annular @xcite geometries for the two - dimensional sample .",
    "let us note that these models consider the sample as well as the threads as quantum objects , if not simply ignoring the existence of the latter .",
    "experimentally , such an assumption is certainly questionable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to revisit a standard quantum mechanical model for the qhe while trying to incorporate as much as possible the specific geometrical and experimental constraints , and to derive from the resulting framework the hall conductivity .",
    "the particular geometry of the qhe , already used in the literature @xcite , and its physical consequences on the quantum mechanics of a two - dimensional interacting electrons gas , will be used as a guide to introduce the mathematical aspects of the model proposed here .",
    "our computation of the hall conductivity relies on the usual hypothesis on the validity of the kubo formula .    in section  [ physicalmathematicalfeatures ] , we recall the physical constraints of the experiment , and relate them to some mathematical properties of certain operators . in section",
    "[ mathematicalmodel ] , we introduce the mathematical formalism of our model . some comments about this model are made in section  [ comments ] .",
    "section  [ computation ] is devoted to the explicit computation of the hall conductivity . in section  [ commentsandconclusion ] ,",
    "we conclude .",
    "recall that the qhe takes place in a very specific physical situation where the electrons , maintained at extremely low temperature can be viewed as being confined to a two - dimensional finite domain on which a perpendicular magnetic field is applied .",
    "the electrons are injected and collected by wires at the four edges of the sample ( see fig .  [ fig - general ] ) .",
    "these wires are classical objects , connected to macroscopic devices ( at room temperature ) which , for instance , measure the intensity of the current . quantum mechanics is required for the description of the electrons confined inside the sample , a rectangular planar domain as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] , while the electrons circulating in the wires must be regarded as classical objects .    keeping this in mind , the only two assumptions concerning the classical properties related to the wires we will make through this paper are : + i ) the conservation of the currents circulating in the wires and + ii ) the fact that the total charge located in one edge of the sample equals the one located in the opposited edge , so that the presence of the wires reflects itself as boundary conditions constraining the quantum mechanics ruling the electrons located inside the rectangular sample domain .    denoting by @xmath2 , @xmath3",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] ) the outgoing signed current for the edge @xmath4 , assumption i ) can be written as @xmath5        these constraints can be reexpressed in term of integrals over each edge of the usual density current which appears in quantum mechanics in the schrdinger representation .",
    "note that these constraints are somehow different from some usual ( _ i.e. _ neumann or dirichlet ) boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , we will see in the following that they give rise naturally to specific mathematical properties for some operators on the hilbert space of the problem .",
    "a typical quantum hall experiment relies on two controlable ( external ) parameters , namely the applied perpendicular ( strong ) magnetic field @xmath6 and the number of electrons @xmath7 ( number of charge carriers ) inside the sample ( which can be experimentally modified for instance by varying an applied gate voltage ) .",
    "most of the experimental data obtained from qhe experiments are measured in term of collective motions of the electrons , as are for example the currents in the wires and the hall conductivity .",
    "accordingly , we will be mainly interested into observables that can be expressed in terms of collective variables ( _ i.e. _ center of mass variables ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the individual position and momentum variables of each electron .",
    "then the currents @xmath11 ( in the absence of any magnetic field ) depend only on the components of the total momentum @xmath12 and @xmath13 through the relation    [ currentdefinition ] @xmath14 where , as usual , @xmath15    together with similar relations for the @xmath16 other currents .    in the following , without lost of generality , we will consider a physical sample defined by the square @xmath17 ^ 2 = [ 0,1 ] \\times [ 0,1]$ ] in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "this slight assumption about the sample geometry will considerably simplify the discussion and most of the formulas involved in the ensuing discussion without altering the conclusions .",
    "we further assume from now on @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 : electron charge ) .",
    "consider the ordinary hamiltonian @xmath22 for @xmath7 identical spinless electrons of mass @xmath23 with mutual interactions in the @xmath24-dimensional square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] , submitted to a constant perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath22 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the interaction potential and the symmetric gauge for the vector potential has been used . note that we could have chosen any linear gauge as we will point out in a while .",
    "this hamiltonian must be a self - adjoint operator in a hilbert space @xmath27 , which looks like the @xmath7-fold tensor product of the hilbert space @xmath28 ^ 2)$ ] of square integrable functions on @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "keeping in mind the remark about collective variables given above , we choose to split the hamiltonian into two parts , one part corresponding to the collective variables defined by @xmath29 and the other part involving `` internal '' variables defined by @xmath30 for @xmath31 and satisfying the relations @xmath32 we then obtain    @xmath33    where @xmath34    and @xmath35 , the internal hamiltonian , depends only of the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is then a tensor product @xmath39 where the collective operators acts only on @xmath40 and the internal ones on @xmath41 .",
    "recall that this splitting is a standard procedure .",
    "most of the ensuing analysis will be focused on the @xmath42 part of the hamiltonian together with the corresponding hilbert space @xmath40 , since the observables we are interested in are operators acting only on @xmath40 .",
    "this hilbert space looks at first sight like @xmath28 ^ 2)$ ] for the variables @xmath43 but we will point out in the next section that this identification is not quite correct and must be considered more carefully .",
    "operators ( especially unbounded ones ) on some hilbert space are not completely defined by their `` formal '' expressions .",
    "we have to specify the domain on which they are defined .",
    "this domain plays a central role in the operator theory , and it is known that in quantum mechanics a choice for such a domain in the case of an unbounded operator can be related to different physical situations .",
    "consider as an example the ordinary quantum mechanics on the interval @xmath17 $ ] . in this case",
    ", it is known that the self - adjointness of the unbounded momentum operator @xmath44 is obtained by a choice of boundary conditions on the wave functions .",
    "these mathematical boundary conditions define a particular ( dense ) domain for @xmath45 , and they can be interpreted as some particular physical restrictions on the boundaries .",
    "more precisely , one can show that there is a one parameter family of self - adjoint operators @xmath46 for @xmath47",
    "whose dense domain of definition is @xmath48 ) /\\",
    "\\phi \\text { absolutely continuous},\\ \\phi '   \\in l^2([0,1]),\\",
    "\\phi(1 ) = e^{i\\theta}\\phi(0 )   \\}.\\ ] ] these operators are not unitary ( and hence not physically ) equivalent for different values of @xmath49 .",
    "we now show that the boundary conditions that have been selected for the qhe at the beginning of this section can be used to choose a dense domain for the operators @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 let us pick the wave functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 belonging to a sufficient regular class .",
    "then , the following simple relations hold :    [ pxrelation ] @xmath54_{x=0}^{x=1 } dy\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath55_{x=0}^{x=1 } dy\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    together with similar relations for @xmath56 . in ( [ pxrelation ] )",
    "we use the notation @xmath57_{x=0}^{x=1 } = f(1,y)-f(0,y)$ ] .",
    "the left hand side of these relations can be more compactly written using the usual scalar product on the hilbert space of square integrable functions .",
    "namely , one obtains    @xmath58_{x=0}^{x=1 } dy\\ ] ]    @xmath59_{x=0}^{x=1 } dy\\ .\\ ] ]    now , the assumption ii ) stating that there is no difference between the total charge located in one edge and in its opposite implies that the right hand side of ( [ pxrelation1b ] ) vanishes for @xmath60 . besides , assumption i )",
    "tells us that the currents associated with opposite side of the sample must satisfy relation ( [ currentconservation ] ) .",
    "then , when @xmath60 , the rhs of ( [ pxrelation2b ] ) can be written as @xmath61_{x=0}^{x=1 } dy$ ] where @xmath62 is the usual expression for the current in the @xmath63-direction for an applied magnetic field @xmath6 so that assumption i ) implies that the rhs of ( [ pxrelation2b ] ) vanishes . summarizing the above considerations , any ( sufficiently regular ) wave function @xmath53 satisfying the boundary conditions i ) and ii ) obeys the following relations    @xmath64    let us denote by @xmath65 the linear space of states compatible with the two boundary conditions . in other words , if @xmath66 , then any linear combinaison of @xmath52 and @xmath53 belongs to @xmath65 . using polarization formulas , it is easy to show that the relations    [ pxyp2xyselfadjoint ] @xmath67    hold also for any @xmath66 .",
    "so , @xmath65 is the linear space of functions on @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] stable by the operators @xmath68 and @xmath56 , and on which ( [ pxyp2xyselfadjoint ] ) are satisfied .",
    "these relations clearly imply that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are self - adjoint operators on @xmath65 .",
    "so we have translated our physical boundary conditions imposed by the geometry and the physics of the qhe into a mathematical formulation of self - adjointness about operators on the hilbert space involved in the problem .",
    "now we are going to take these mathematical conditions as the starting point for the construction of the mathematical framework that will permit us to calculate the hall conductivity .",
    "let us introduce the operator algebra for the operators whose action must be represented on the hilbert space @xmath40 .",
    "these latter are the two coordinates operators associated with the variables @xmath18 , that we denote by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the operators @xmath68 and @xmath56 are the `` differential expressions '' for the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , where the curl of the potential vector @xmath75 is @xmath7 times the applied magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the appearance of the quantity @xmath76 is related to the fact that we work with the center of mass variables @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 and @xmath78 these operators .",
    "the four operators @xmath79 must obey the following constraints .",
    "they obey to the commutations relations : @xmath80 & = 0 & [ p_x , p_y ] & = i nb\\nonumber \\\\ [ p_x , x ] & = -i & [ p_x , y ] & = 0   \\label{algebra}\\\\ [ p_y , x ] & = 0 & [ p_y , y ] & = -i\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] besides , the spectrum of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the unit interval @xmath17 $ ] . finally , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are self - adjoint .    the commutations relations can be obtained using the ordinary commutation relations between the operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the presence of the constant magnetic field while the spectrum of the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 is just related to the finite size of the physical sample .",
    "note that the self - adjointness of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a consequence of the discussion about boundary conditions .",
    "consider now the hamiltonian @xmath42 which can be expressed as @xmath85    contrary to the one dimensional situation , there is no general method for representing @xmath77 and @xmath78 as self - adjoint operators .",
    "here , we will make an ansatz , inspired by the one dimensional situation recalled above .",
    "indeed , one knows that @xmath77 and @xmath78 must behave like the first order differential operators @xmath68 and @xmath56 . keeping this in mind",
    ", we shall take the following ansatz for the representation of the algebra ( [ algebra ] ) :    1 .",
    "the domain on which @xmath77 and @xmath78 are defined is the linear space of functions @xmath86",
    "^ 2)$ ] , absolutely continuous in the two variables , whose first derivatives belong to @xmath28 ^ 2)$ ] .",
    "the boundary conditions are of the form @xmath87 for any real functions @xmath88 .",
    "these relations can be viewed as a generalization of the one dimensional case ( see the definition of @xmath89 ) .",
    "2 .   the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 are first order differential operators acting on these functions , whose expression are @xmath90 for two functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the commutation relations between @xmath77 and @xmath78 then imply @xmath93 one easily observes that the right ( resp . left ) hand side of this latter expression depends only on @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath94 ) , so that it must be a real constant @xmath95 .",
    "the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are then of the form @xmath96 for two real constants @xmath97 . from this",
    ", it follows that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . further performing a gauge transformation given by @xmath100",
    ", one can get rid of the constants @xmath97 appearing in the explicit expressions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these constants will however reappear as arbitrary constants in the definitions of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see ( [ ansatzboundary ] ) ) .",
    "let us define @xmath103 and @xmath104 , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 satisfying the relation @xmath107 the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 then take the form @xmath108 at this level , one comment is in order .",
    "the arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) is related to a gauge fixing for the vector potential whose curl is @xmath76 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath109 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 coincide with @xmath68 and @xmath56 . in the following",
    ", we will not fix any particular value for @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , it can be easily shown , by gauge transformation , that taking more general dependence of the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 on the variables @xmath63 and @xmath94 would simply means considering a unitary equivalent representation of our algebra ( [ algebra ] ) .",
    "one observes now that the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 have a form similar to the one for some covariant derivatives on a line vector bundle over a two dimensional torus @xmath111 .",
    "note however that it is not the case for arbitrary value of @xmath76 , as we will point out in a while . from ( [ pxandpy ] ) , it is easy to deduce the possible boundary conditions of the form ( [ ansatzboundary ] ) .",
    "they are given by @xmath112 the two real parameters @xmath97 are arbitrary and they label inequivalent representations of @xmath113 for different values ( modulo @xmath114 ) .",
    "we will denote by @xmath115 the domain on which are defined the @xmath77 and @xmath78 that we have constructed just above for specific values of @xmath116 .",
    "it appears as we will see in the sequel that it is very convenient to keep the same notation @xmath113 for the different representations of these operators , so that the @xmath116 dependence will not be explicitely indicated .",
    "as already mentionned , for different values of @xmath116 which are equal modulo @xmath114 , the representations are equivalent .",
    "so we take as fondamental domain for @xmath116 the square @xmath117 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , we keep in mind that it will be very convenient for further considerations to allow for all possible real values for @xmath116 .",
    "the general structure in the @xmath116-plane will be explored in a while .",
    "we emphasize that there is neither physical nor mathematical constraints on the parameters @xmath118 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "actually , from a physical viewpoint , it is very natural to consider all their possible values .",
    "this reflects the fact that considering at once a large number of possible mathematical boundary conditions corresponds to a unique physical state for the classical current through the threads .",
    "this can be translated on a more mathematical footing by considering the relevant hilbert space appearing in the problem equal to the direct sum of the hilbert spaces associated to each individual values of the couple @xmath116 .",
    "this direct sum takes the form of a direct hilbertian integral over @xmath117 ^ 2 $ ] of isomorphic hilbert spaces ( each representation being defined in the same hilbert space @xmath28 ^ 2)$ ] ) .",
    "a general wave function is then an element of @xmath28 ^ 2\\times [ 0 , 2\\pi]^2)$ ] .",
    "let us introduce in this hilbert space the linear subspace @xmath119 of functions @xmath120 which are continuous in @xmath116 , and such that for any pair @xmath116 , @xmath120 is an element of @xmath115 .",
    "these functions then satisfy the following boundary relations @xmath121 when @xmath76 is different from @xmath122 for any integer @xmath123 , we further impose that these functions vanish at the four points @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which is dictated by ( [ boundarypsi ] ) . the space @xmath119 is chosen to be the domain on which @xmath77 and @xmath78 are defined .    we choose a partial normalization on the functions @xmath52 of the form @xmath128 ^ 2 } dx dy ( \\psi^\\ast \\psi)(x , y,\\gamma,\\eta ) = 1\\ ] ] for all @xmath129 so that @xmath52 is normalized to unity , namely @xmath130 ^ 2 } d\\gamma d\\eta \\int_{[0,1]^2 } dx dy ( \\psi^\\ast \\psi)(x , y,\\gamma,\\eta ) = 1\\ .\\ ] ] this integral completely defines the scalar product on our hilbert space .",
    "consider now the operators @xmath131 .",
    "we can represent them as multiplicative operators by the coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath94 respectively on a dense domain of functions which vanish on the edges of the square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the spectrums of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are then @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "if one needs to work with @xmath132 at the same time , one must consider the intersections of the domain @xmath119 and the domain on which @xmath131 are defined .",
    "this reduces considerably the interesting structure for @xmath119 , because functions in @xmath119 must then vanish at the boundary of the square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] , eliminating any dependence on @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "fortunately , we will not have to deal with all these operators at the same time .",
    "actually , only the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 will be used .",
    "in particular , we have seen that the hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "so in the following , we will focalize ourselves on the structure of @xmath119 .",
    "one can now consider a dense domain @xmath135 ^ 2\\times [ 0 , 2\\pi]^2)$ ] for the operators @xmath136 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is the restriction of the domain @xmath119 defined by the condition that @xmath52 belongs to @xmath65 if @xmath52 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are in @xmath119 . in particular , the functions in this domain",
    "satisfy the relations ( [ boundarypsi ] ) and the hamiltonian @xmath42 ( [ hamiltonian0 ] ) is well defined on @xmath65 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( resp .",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath82 ) are self - adjoint operators on the dense domain @xmath119 ( resp .",
    "@xmath65 ) , so that all wave functions in @xmath65 satisfy our physical boundary conditions ( [ pxyp2xyselfadjoint ] ) . in the rest of this paper ,",
    "the dense domain relevant for the problem will be identified with @xmath65 .",
    "we now make some comments about the mathematical framework we have constructed in the previous section .",
    "first , notice that we did not prove the uniqueness of this representation .",
    "however , the ansatz we have chosen gives us enough generality to obtain this rich structure .",
    "moreover , this representation is not irreducible .",
    "this is an important feature , which is related to the full generality of the boundary conditions we have imposed .",
    "as already mentionned , this is actually necessary in order to take into account the largest possible number of mathematical boundary conditions compatible with our physical conditions .",
    "besides , performing an arbitrary gauge transformation on this representation does not alter its corresponding main structures .",
    "note that the arbitrariness on the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 already take into account a large class of gauge choices .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ boundarypsi ] ) are very similar to some relations that the sections of a line vector bundle must satisfy .",
    "indeed , we could be tempted to consider the space @xmath139 ^ 2 $ ] as a two dimensional torus , and the functions @xmath140 as sections of a line vector bundle over it . but this is _ not possible _ for all values of @xmath76 , as it can be easily verified by considering the variations of the functions along a path on the edge of the square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] . as already briefly noticed , the particular values @xmath141 ( for an integer @xmath123 ) are singled out in this respect . only when @xmath141 is it possible to consider the functions @xmath140 as sections of a line vector bundle over a two dimensional torus .",
    "the condition @xmath141 reflects the known fact that the first chern class of such a bundle must be an integer .",
    "notice that this underlying torus does not actually exist . in the following",
    ", we will study the structure of @xmath65 assuming that @xmath141 .",
    "if one performs the gauge transformation @xmath142 then the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 become @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath145 simplify to @xmath146 as a counterpart , the @xmath116 dependence is completely transfered into the operators @xmath147 and @xmath148 . obviously , both representations give rise to the same physics , and we will make use of this second representation in the next section to compute the kubo formula .",
    "we have already noticed that the indices @xmath116 of these different inequivalent representations need not to vary in @xmath149 but only in @xmath117 $ ] because if , for instance , @xmath150 we get a represention which is equivalent to the one for @xmath151 .",
    "even when the representations are equivalent , the functions @xmath152 and @xmath153 are not the same .",
    "actually , the space of the latter is unitarily equivalent to the space @xmath65 of the former .",
    "we will not use explicitely this unitary correspondence . in the next section",
    ", we will use the functions @xmath120 _ as if _ they were defined for @xmath154 .",
    "this will be a convenient way to write some relations between them , and it will have to be understood modulo unitary correspondences .    if one applies a small electric field for instance in the @xmath63 direction , this electric field contributes only in @xmath42 , because each electron undergoes the same influence . indeed , in the total hamiltonian , one adds the sum @xmath155 to @xmath22 .",
    "this term depends only on @xmath63 , and so must be a part of @xmath42 .",
    "one alternative way to implement such an electric field is to create an increasing magnetic flux in one of the loops that the wires form in the experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] ) .",
    "this ( very slowly ) increasing flux @xmath156 will then comes out as an extra additional contribution to one of the operators @xmath77 or @xmath78 . the resulting currents induced by this electric field can then be computed by the linear response formula of kubo @xcite , for the total hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , the hall conductivity can be obtained in this way . notice",
    "that because this electric field appears only in @xmath42 , the kubo formula will factor out the contribution from @xmath35 .",
    "now , it is known that this kubo formula can be expressed in term of the first chern class of a line vector bundle @xcite .",
    "the key procedure to do this is to express the velocity operators in terms of some derivatives of the hamiltonian operator with respect to some variables .",
    "these variables define the base space of the line vector bundle mentioned before .",
    "we refer to the literature for the exact expressions , and to appendix  [ kuboformula ] for the actual formula we have to compute in our framework . in the present case ,",
    "the natural variables are the pair @xmath116 when one takes the new representation ( [ gaugetransformation ] ) .",
    "indeed , as already noticed , the @xmath116 counterparts appear as additional terms in the momentum operators .",
    "the derivatives of the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath157 with respect to @xmath133 and @xmath134 gives then the velocities in the @xmath63 and @xmath94 directions .",
    "we assume in what follows that the kubo formula can be applied in the present situation .",
    "in particular , this requires the occurrence of some properties concerning the fermi gap and some extra conditions about the degeneracy of the ground - state which will appear later ( see appendix  [ kuboformula ] ) .",
    "these conditions apply to the total hamiltonian @xmath22 ( [ totalhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "clearly , the approach to the qhe we propose here bears some similarities with others approaches that have been reported in the past , in particular the appearance of two extra parameters defined on a torus , a square or a rectangle ( @xmath116 in our case ) .",
    "we would like to mention some of them .",
    "the first one can be found in thouless _",
    "_ @xcite and kohmoto @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the two extra parameters are related to the underlying crystallographic structure of the sample .",
    "they are generalized crystal momenta , which parameterize the bloch waves functions , and are restricted in a magnetic brillouin zone , which is a finite rectangle .",
    "the kubo formula is then related to the first chern class of a line vector bundle over this brillouin zone . in this approach",
    ", the underlying torus is connected to some microscopic periodicity .",
    "this kind of model has the drawback that one has to assume an infinite sample .",
    "however , these pionneering investigations have been a starting point for further developpements . in particular , all the essential features coming from the presence of these two extra parameters have been exposed .",
    "the second kind of approach we would like to comment can be found in niu and thouless @xcite and avron and seiler @xcite . in this approach , the global geometry of the qhe of fig .",
    "[ fig - general ] is used to introduce the extra parameters .",
    "they are connected to the two fluxes through the loops of the wires .",
    "one of them is used to impose an electric field in the sample ( as already mentioned ) , and the other is used to measure the response of the system . by a gauge transformation , it is easy to see that these fluxes have periodic effects on the system , and are therefore restricted to the two dimensional torus @xmath158 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the salient feature of this approach is that it does not suppose any specific microscopic properties such as a crystallographic periodicity .",
    "notice that the use of some periodic flux of a magnetic field ( not connected to the magnetic field in the sample ) goes back to the laughlin s argument @xcite , in which a cylindrical geometry was considered .",
    "finally , our model bears some similarity to the one proposed by niu , thouless and wu @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the extra parameters are some phases in the boundary conditions of the wave functions over a rectangular sample .",
    "although they mention the hermiticity of the hamiltonian as a requirement for their choice of these boundary conditions , they do not strongly relate them to some physical experimental origins as we did .",
    "however , except for instance the separation of the variables into the global and the `` internal '' ones , some of the essential features of our model are already involved in @xcite .",
    "we must stress that our approach involves the representation of an abstract algebra by operators ( with specific adjointness properties ) on a hilbert space .",
    "some other propositions has been made in this direction previously .",
    "one of them has been performed by grmm , narnhofer and thirring @xcite and grmm @xcite .",
    "these authors consider an abstract algebra generated by the position and momentum operators similar to the one we introduce , and represent it on a hilbert space for different underlying geometries .",
    "unfortunately , these geometries are not enough realistic to produce a pertinent model for integral and _ fractional _ qhe .",
    "all the models mentionned in the previous section give rise to a hall conductivity that takes integer or fractional values ( in units @xmath159 ) . as far as we know",
    ", no one has permitted to _ compute _ it , and to relate it to the filling factor @xmath160 . in this section ,",
    "we show that when the product @xmath76 satisfy the integrity condition @xmath161 , this computation can be performed entirely .",
    "recall that when @xmath161 for an integer @xmath123 , one can take advantage of the properties of a line vector bundle over the two dimensional torus with periodicity @xmath162 in the variables @xmath18 .",
    "this permits us to write @xmath120 for values of @xmath63 and @xmath94 greater than @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath163 besides , as previously discussed , we consider the variables @xmath133 and @xmath134 belonging to @xmath149 . in order to compute the kubo formula",
    ", one has to compute the first chern class of the line vector bundle over @xmath164 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "let us characterize this line vector bundle .",
    "one way to do that is to look for the possible symmetries of the system .",
    "such a symmetry has to commute with @xmath42 , to act only on the collective variables ( so is a symmetry of @xmath40 ) and to leave globally invariant the dense domain @xmath65 .",
    "it appears that there exists two commuting unitary operators having these properties .",
    "indeed , if one looks for some unitary operator of the form @xmath165 which commutes with @xmath42 and leaves @xmath65 invariant ( which is equivalent to leave invariant the relations ( [ boundarypsitorus1 ] ) and ( [ boundarypsitorus2 ] ) ) , then one obtains a two parameters family of unitary operators @xmath166 defined by @xmath167 actually , a straightforward computation shows that these operators commute not only with @xmath42 , but also with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "so , one has @xmath168 , and @xmath169 = [ p_y , \\cu_{\\theta , \\sigma } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "but for different couples of the parameters @xmath170 these operators do not commute .",
    "actually , one has @xmath171 note that these unitary operators could be considered as some generalization of the usual magnetic translation operators .",
    "as explained previously and further developed in appendix  [ kuboformula ] , the hall conductivity can be computed using the gauge transformed functions @xmath145 defined by ( [ gaugetransformation ] ) in the kubo formula . in the following , we will work with these functions .",
    "the @xmath24-parameter family of unitary operators ( [ twoparametersfamily ] ) takes then the form @xmath172 we take the two special values corresponding to the @xmath173 translation in the variables @xmath133 and @xmath134 : @xmath174 these operators satisfy to the commutation relations @xmath175 so that the two operators @xmath176 and @xmath177 commute with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "one knows that unitary operators satisfying ( [ commutationrelations ] ) can be represented as @xmath180 matrices of the form @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 and @xmath184 are real parameters .",
    "the operators @xmath185 and @xmath186 therefore represent multiplication by respectively @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "our hilbert space can then be decomposed into direct sums of such representations ( sectors ) , labelled by @xmath189 up to some extra parameters ( extra degeneracy ) .",
    "so , one can introduce @xmath123-uplets of orthogonal functions and @xmath186 . here , we do nt use explicitely this formalism , but we nevertheless keep it in mind in order to make meaningfull some expression appearing in the text . ] @xmath190 which satisfy , if one uses the explicit expression for @xmath178 and @xmath179 @xmath191 the relation ( [ uaction ] ) tells us that the function @xmath192 restricted to @xmath193 $ ] , for @xmath194 , is completely determined by its restriction on @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "similarly , relation ( [ vaction ] ) means that the function @xmath196 restricted to @xmath197 $ ] can be obtained by the restriction of @xmath198 on @xmath199 $ ] for @xmath200 .",
    "globally , the functions @xmath192 are completely characterized either by their @xmath123 restrictions to the elementary cell @xmath201 ^ 2 $ ] or by only one of them restricted to @xmath202\\times [ 0 , 2\\pi]$ ] . applying the operators @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and using the boundary relations ( [ boundarypsitorus1 ] ) and ( [ boundarypsitorus2 ] ) , one can show that each function @xmath198 satisfies the periodic relations @xmath203 if one considers @xmath204 as parameters , then @xmath205 is a section of a line vector bundles over @xmath116 with periodicity @xmath122 , which we denote by @xmath206 .",

    ", one obtains again ( [ sigmaxynb ] ) .    in our units , the elementary flux @xmath220 is @xmath173 and @xmath159 is @xmath221 , so that the number of magnetic fluxes though the sample is @xmath222 .",
    "then , @xmath223 has finally the expression @xmath224    in this computation , we used only the dependence of the wave functions in the global variables @xmath63 and @xmath94 . as noticed previously in the text and in appendix  [ kuboformula ] , the structure of the kubo formula permits one to avoid explicit reference to the @xmath41 part of the hilbert space , and only general properties on the part of the wave functions in this hilbert space are used , for instance their orthonormalisations .",
    "we now make some comments about the different geometrical structures appearing in this framework .",
    "the first line vector bundle which is involved has @xmath139 ^ 2 $ ] as base space .",
    "its first chern class is @xmath225 .",
    "notice that the magnetic field , taken alone , does not need to be of the form @xmath122 , which appears to be different from other mathematical models that already appeared in the literature .",
    "this reflects the fact that we used global variables .",
    "this line vector bundle has no physical existence , and it is only a mathematical tool used to compute the conductivity .",
    "the second line vector bundle has @xmath226 ^ 2 $ ] for base space .",
    "its first chern class is @xmath227 .",
    "its appearance and its structure are strongly related to the first line vector bundle through the unitary symmetry present in the model .",
    "indeed , this symmetry connects directly some translations in the first base space with some in the second base space .",
    "as seen in the computation , the degeneracy associated to each sector of the representation of the unitary symmetries @xmath178 and @xmath179 is related to the line vector bundle over @xmath226 ^ 2 $ ] when one assembles these functions into a global section of this bundle .",
    "similar geometrical structures have been considered previously in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "notice finally that our computation fails when @xmath228 . in this case , the first line vector bundle does not exist , and the family of unitary symmetries can not be implemented easily .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new formalism which permits one to deal with some quantum mechanical aspects of the qhe . this formalism has permitted us to compute the hall conductivity , provided some physical assumptions are made about the applicability of the kubo formula and its variant in presence of degeneracy .",
    "this formalism has been introduced using physical motivations .",
    "its main caracteristic is that it take into account all the possible boundary conditions compatible with the experimental situation .",
    "this is mathematically translated into the fact that the representation of the algebra ( [ algebra ] ) is _",
    "reducible_. this reducibility is the key ingredient for the computation of the hall conductivity , where this representation space is decomposed ( continuously ) into representations of some unitary symmetries .",
    "these symmetries help us to characterize the line vector bundle whose first chern class appears in the kubo formula , because they connect a line vector bundle over the space @xmath18 and the latter line vector bundle over the space @xmath116 .",
    "let us comment now the results of the computation .",
    "the experiment predicts a value for the hall conductivity which is @xmath159 times a fraction . this fraction is usually identified with the theoretical filling factor defined by @xmath229 .",
    "actually , this definition of the filling factor makes explicit reference to the landau model on the whole plane @xmath230 , in which the number of states that the system can occupy is known .",
    "here it is not the case .",
    "our result agrees however with the experiment , since it predicts a hall conductivity @xmath159 times a fraction , and the dependence of this fraction with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the expected one . at present time",
    ", we do not have any satisfactory explanation for the factor @xmath24 appearing here in the square shaped sample case .",
    "notice that in our formalism and computation , and actually in any model based on topological considerations , a possible difference between the odd and even denominators of the filling factor has nowhere emerged .",
    "this implies that in order to explain all the experimental observations , one has to make some refinements to the model .",
    "a plausible situation is that the term of the hamiltonian for the `` internal '' variables may play a crucial part here .",
    "our model does not explain , as well , the observed stability of the plateaus . in order to get some information in this direction",
    ", one would have to compute the hall conductivity for @xmath6 such that @xmath228 , but with @xmath76 _ near _ @xmath122 . in this case , as already noticed , our computation fails , because we do not have a line vector bundle on the space @xmath18 anymore .",
    "the kubo formula gives us the hall conductivity in the form @xmath231 where @xmath232 denotes the ground state and @xmath233 the excited states of the hamiltonian for the @xmath7 electrons in the absence of electric field , @xmath234 is defined with the total velocity operator @xmath235 as @xmath236 , and the values @xmath20 and @xmath19 have been assumed . the usual procedure to compute the mean value of the velocity is to derive the hamiltonian by parameters which appear as an additional terms in the momentum operators , and take the mean value of these derivatives @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "notice that this computation concerns only the global variables of the hamiltonian .",
    "it can be easily done if one performs the gauge transformation ( [ gaugetransformation ] ) and uses the parameters @xmath129 to derive the new hamiltonian @xmath157 obtained by this gauge transformation .",
    "we assume that the remaining part of the wave function which depends only on the internal variables is normalized to @xmath162 .",

    "as explained in the text , in some cases , the computation of this integral can be done using a geometric identification of that kind .",
