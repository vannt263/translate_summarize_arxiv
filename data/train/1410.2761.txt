    "it is well known that the formal integrals near stable periodic orbits are not convergent .",
    "nevertheless , their finite truncations represent with remarkable accuracy the quasi - periodic motions near the stable periodic orbits(for a review see contopoulos @xmath1)@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is less well known that the formal integrals are convergent near * unstable * periodic orbits .    in order to explain this difference ,",
    "let us consider the case of two coupled oscillators with hamiltonian    @xmath2    where the frequencies @xmath3 are real the ratio @xmath4 is irrational .",
    "a particular formal integral near the origin @xmath5 is of the form    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and its higher order terms are of the form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the divisors @xmath11 can become arbitrarily small for particular _",
    "m _ and _ n _ , and this leads to the nonconvergence of the series@xmath12 .    on the other hand",
    "if one frequency , say @xmath13 , is imaginary @xmath14 the divisors never approach zero and the series @xmath12 is convergent in a certain domain around the origin . near the origin",
    ", in this case , we have chaos .",
    "but we can use these convergent series to study the chaotic motions analytically .",
    "the convergence of the integrals near unstable periodic orbits was first demonstrated by moser ( @xmath15@xcite,@xmath16 @xcite ) and the proof was completed by giorgilli ( @xmath17)@xcite . da silva ritter et al .",
    "( @xmath18@xcite demonstrated that in simple 2d mappings the domain of convergence extends to infinity along the asymptotic curves emanating from the unstable points .",
    "these asymptotic curves intersect at an infinity of homoclinic points ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the curves form elongated oscillations and cover the neighborhood of the unstable point _",
    "o _ where chaos is dominant .",
    "thus the formal series can be used to describe the chaotic domain close to the unstable point _ o _ .    on the other hand in the case of hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom some numerical results up to now vieira et al.(@xmath19)@xcite ) , and bongini et al .",
    "( @xmath17)@xcite ) indicate that the domain of convergence extends at most up to the central homoclinic point @xmath20(opposite to _ o _ in fig.1 ) .",
    "in the present paper we briefly summarize our results of efthymiopoulos et al.(@xmath21)@xciteregarding : i)the problem of the convergence both in the case of mappings and in the case of hamiltonian systems , and ii ) a new method for extending the calculation of the invariant curves arbitrarily beyond the central homoclinic point in the hamiltonian case .",
    "for details see efthymiopoulos et al.(@xmath21)@xcite",
    "we consider a real analytic 2d mapping of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23    then we find a canonical transformation to new variables @xmath24 such that the mapping takes the normal form @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 the asymptotic curves from the origin are @xmath28 and @xmath29 as particular examples we consider ( a ) the standard map @xmath30 which is of the form @xmath31 after a linear diagonaling transformation , and ( b ) the hnon map @xmath32\\\\ x_2^{'}&=&e^{-a}[x_2+\\frac{1}{4}(x_1+x_2)^2]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  in both cases we truncate the series @xmath33 , giving @xmath34 and @xmath35 , at a particular order n and then we transform back to the original variables @xmath36 in order to find the invariant curves @xmath28 and @xmath37 in the variables @xmath38    in the case of the standard map we start the unstable invariant curve at the point @xmath39 ) and the stable invariant curve at the point @xmath40 . in fig.2",
    "we draw the numerical results by thin lines and the analytical results by thick lines .",
    "if we truncate the series at order @xmath41 we find the thick curves of fig.2a .",
    "we see that the analytic curves agree with the numerical results up to one homoclinic point @xmath42 beyond ( and before @xmath43 ) ) the central homoclinic point @xmath44 . but beyond that point the analytical curves @xmath45 and @xmath46 deviate from the numerical curves @xmath47 and @xmath48    when the truncation takes place at order @xmath49 ( fig.@xmath50 ) the analytic curves agree with the numerical curves up to the second homoclinic point @xmath51 beyond @xmath20 or before it @xmath52",
    ".    in the case of the hnon map both unstable and stable asymptotic curves start at @xmath53 . in this case if we truncate the series at order @xmath41 we find agreement between the analytical and numerical curves ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) up to the second homoclinic point beyond @xmath20 ( fig.@xmath56 ) .",
    "if we truncate the series at the order @xmath57 we find agreement even beyond the fourth homoclinic point @xmath58 beyond @xmath20 ( fig.@xmath59 ) . in this latter case we find that the analytic asymptotic curves come quite close to the original unstable point _",
    "o _ , thus they enter in the chaotic region near _ o_.    it can be shown that in both the standard map and the hnon map the radii of convergence of the series along the asymptotic curves are infinite @xcite .",
    "this can be demonstrated numerically by using the d alembert criterion.i.e . by calculating the absolute value of the ratio of the successive terms of the series @xmath60 .",
    "we find that this increases with n. however the approach to infinity is quite different in the standard map and in the hnon map .",
    "namely @xmath61 increases linearly in @xmath62 in the standard map , while it increases like @xmath63 in the hnon map .",
    "thus the increase is much slower in the case of the standard map than in the case of the hnon map .",
    "this explains why in fig.2 the series at order @xmath49 represent the true ( numerical ) results only up to the second homoclinic point beyond @xmath20 in the first case , while the series at order @xmath57 reach the fourth homoclinic point in the second case .",
    "however the convergence radius is infinite only if the mapping is analytic over the whole domain covered by the invariant manifolds .",
    "otherwise the convergence radius is finite . as an example we consider the mapping    @xmath64    which has the same unstable point ( the origin)and the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the standard map .",
    "however if we develop the formula for @xmath65 as a taylor series we find that it has a singular points for @xmath66 , i.e. for imaginary values of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore it converges only if @xmath68 . for",
    "larger @xmath69 the hyperbolic normal form fails to represent the numerical invariant curves.in fact it does not even reach the central homoclinic point ( fig.4 ) .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian ( efthymiopoulos @xmath70 @xcite )    @xmath71\\cos\\psi\\ ] ]    which is @xmath72 degrees of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 11 ) represents a perturbed pendulum .",

    "however there are two large islands of stability around two stable orbits on the @xmath83 axis .",
    "furthermore there are invariant curves from @xmath84 to @xmath85 above and below the chaotic zone , and small secondary islands .",

    "a first application is in the case @xmath73 ( the case of the pendulum ) .",
    "the exact ( numerical ) asymptotic curves u an s from @xmath115 and @xmath117 join smoothly at the point @xmath118 where @xmath83 ( fig.@xmath119 ) .",
    "however the analytic expansions at order @xmath120 and @xmath121 do not reach the point @xmath20 , although they approach it better for larger @xmath109 . for much larger @xmath109",
    "the theoretical curves come even closer to @xmath20 , but without reaching it .",
    "thus the convergence of the analytic series is only up to the point @xmath20 .",
    "it is remarkable that even in this simple case ( the pendulum ) the analytic series apply only up to the middle point @xmath122    similar results are found for @xmath123 ( fig.@xmath124 ) .",
    "the analytic curves apply only to parts of the real ( numerical ) asymptotic curves and do not even reach the central homoclinic point @xmath20 .",
    "similar indications that the convergence of the analytic ( normal form ) series reach only the central homoclinic point @xmath20 have been found by vieria et al.(@xmath19)@xcite and by bongini et al .",
    "( @xmath17)@xcite .",
    "in order to find series applicable beyond the central homoclinic point @xmath20 we use action angle variables and not cartesian coordinates as in the previous sections . in particular , in eq.(@xmath125)we do not expand @xmath98 in taylor series .      if we consider @xmath126 as a complex variable",
    "the domain of analyticity covers the whole real interval @xmath127 but it has a limited imaginary extent @xmath128 ( where , @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus we can not have a large radius of convergence for @xmath126 .",
    "however , if we split the interval @xmath130 of the angle @xmath131 in parts where the convergence is guaranteed , by separating the corresponding times @xmath132 into intervals @xmath133 such that @xmath134= _ t _ , then , the composition of the series produced by analytically continuing from one interval to the other are convergent .",
    "the asymptotic curves are the axes @xmath113 ( unstable ) and @xmath112 ( stable ) in the new variables ( fig.@xmath135 ) , while the corresponding curves in the original variables @xmath136 are the curves u and s of fig.@xmath135 . in order to find the mapping of any point @xmath137 of the axis @xmath113 to the corresponding point ( a ) in fig.@xmath135 we proceed as follows : @xmath138 we calculate the @xmath139 pre - image ( at time @xmath140 ) along the axis @xmath113 and reach a point @xmath141 , at sufficiently small distance from o , so that the mapping to the old variables ( to the point @xmath142 ) is convergent .",
    "@xmath12 we calculate the @xmath143 image of the point @xmath142,(separating every interval _ t _ into pieces , as indicated above ) and find the point a , which is the image of the point @xmath137 .",
    "we repeat the same process along the stable manifold @xmath112 to find the image b of the point @xmath144 .",
    "these processes are exact if the original segments @xmath145 and @xmath146 are not very long .     applying this method to the hamiltonian @xmath147 we found an appropriate separation of t in @xmath148 pieces @xmath149 then by taking @xmath150",
    "we found the bold curves of fig.@xmath151 .",
    "namely we calculated the unstable asymptotic curve u from the periodic orbit @xmath115 and the stable asymptotic curve s from @xmath116 , and found that the theoretical curves u and s agree with the exact ( numerical ) curves up to beyond the homoclinic points @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( fig.@xmath151 ) .    doing the same calculations with @xmath154 , we found agreement between the analytical and numerical results up to beyond the homoclinic points @xmath155 ( fig.@xmath156 ) .",
    "we can then find the homoclinic points to a high accuracy by using a newton - raphson method .",
    "in fig.@xmath156 we see that the analytical asymptotic curves make large oscillations close to the unstable invariant points .",
    "thus they enter in the chaotic regions around these points . by extending the asymptotic curves ( u and s )",
    "even further we find that their oscillations reach also the chaotic regions near the homoclinic points .    in a similar way we find the intersections of the asymptotic curves @xmath157 from @xmath158 and @xmath89 from @xmath159 ( figs.@xmath160 ) .",
    "however in this case the oscillations of the curves @xmath157 and @xmath89 are very small .",
    "the hamiltonian cases that we considered in sections @xmath161 and @xmath148 are very similar to the mappings of section @xmath162 .",
    "in fact in the hamiltonian case we calculate the mappings along the asymptotic curves starting with points on the axes of the new variables @xmath163 and we find the corresponding points on the asymptotic curves u , s ( or @xmath164 ) in the old variables",
    ".    however there is an important difference between the simple mappings , like the standard map and the hnon map , and the mappings generated by the hamiltonians . in the simple mappings of section 2 the series transformations have an infinite radius of convergence , while in the hamiltonian case the radius of convergence of the series is finite .",
    "this is why , by using taylor series , as in section 3 , we can not even find the central homoclinic point @xmath122 on the other hand , by the method exposed above we obtain a representation of the        by using our extended method with large _",
    "m _ we can find very accurately the details of the asymptotic curves in the chaotic regions around the periodic orbits . by a similar method we can find the structure of the regions between the oscillating asymptotic curves ( efthymiopoulos et al .",
    "@xmath21@xcite ) by considering cases where the integral @xmath167 is different from zero .",
    "thus the details of the chaotic regions around the unstable periodic orbits ( and around their homoclinic points ) can be obtained analytically .",
    "this shows that chaos is not at all random , but can be represented by accurate analytical formulae if we apply our new method .",
    "this finding opens new possibilities for the study of chaos in dynamical systems .",
    "a final figure ( fig.10 ) shows an analytic calculation of heteroclinic intersections .",
    "these are the intersections of the unstable manifold of the unstable periodic orbit @xmath53 with the stable manifold of the unstable periodic orbit @xmath168 in the standard map for @xmath169 . for this value of _",
    "k _ the periodic orbit @xmath168 is unstable , thus it has a stable and an unstable manifold .",
    "the stable manifold is long enough and intersects the unstable manifold of the orbit @xmath53 at many heteroclinic points . in fig.@xmath170",
    "we see also homoclinic points between the unstable manifold from the periodic orbit @xmath53 and the stable manifold from @xmath40 , which is the same periodic orbit as @xmath53 because of the modulo @xmath81 in the standard map @xmath171 .",
    "the heteroclinic points are the most important manifestation of chaos .",
    "in fact an orbit starting at an heteroclinic point of fig.10 , tends asymptotically to the periodic orbit @xmath168 as @xmath172 , while in the past it tended to the periodic orbit @xmath53 as @xmath173 .",
    "thus this orbit produces a very obvious mixing of different regions of the phase space .",
    "the orbits shown in fig.10 are calculated both numerically and analytically , using the method described above , with series truncated at order @xmath41 .",
