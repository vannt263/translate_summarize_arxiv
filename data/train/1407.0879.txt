    "in the absence of a reliable theory for quantum gravity , the influence of the gravitational field on quantum matter is investigated within the framework of semiclassical theory . in the latter , the gravitational field",
    "is considered as the classical background and the back reaction of quantum effects is described by quasiclassical einstein equations with the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor for quantum fields in the right - hand side ( for reviews see @xcite-@xcite ) . among the most interesting effects in this field",
    "are the particle production and the vacuum polarization by strong gravitational fields .",
    "a well known example is the thermal radiation emitted by black holes .",
    "the investigation of quantum effects in curved backgrounds is motivated by several reasons . during the cosmological expansion of the universe , the back reaction of the particles created by a time dependent gravitational field at early stages leads to a rapid isotropization of the expansion . according to the inflationary scenario ,",
    "the quantum vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field , amplified by the gravitational field during the quasi - de sitter like expansion , serve as seeds for the large scale structure formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "the information on the properties of these fluctuations are encoded in the thermal anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background which are measured with high accuracy by a number of recent cosmological projects .",
    "an important feature of quantum field theory in curved backgrounds is a possible breakdown of the energy conditions in the formulations of hawking - penrose singularity theorems , by the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor of quantum fields .",
    "this opens a possibility to solve the singularity problem within the framework of classical general relativity .",
    "an additional motivation for the study of quantum field theoretical effects in curved backgrounds appeared recently in condensed matter physics related to various analog models .",
    "in particular , the long wavelength properties of the electronic subsystem in a graphene sheet are well described by the dirac - like model with the speed of light replaced by the fermi velocity . in curved graphene structures ( for example",
    ", in fullerenes ) the corresponding field theory is formulated on curved geometry and the curvature effects should be taken into account in the calculations of physical properties of these structures @xcite .",
    "a large number of problems , in addition to the curvature of the background spacetime , involve boundaries on which the operator of a quantum field obeys prescribed boundary conditions",
    ". the physical nature of the boundaries can be different .",
    "the examples are macroscopic bodies in qed , edges of graphene sheets in nanoribbons , interfaces separating different phases of a physical system , horizons in gravitational physics , the branes in higher - dimensional field - theoretical models . among the most interesting macroscopic manifestations of the influence of boundaries on the properties of a quantum field",
    "is the casimir effect ( see refs .",
    "it arises as a consequence of the modification of the quantum fluctuations spectrum by the boundary conditions imposed on the field . as a result of this ,",
    "the expectation values of physical observables are changed and forces arise acting on the constraining boundaries . the effect for scalar , fermionic and vector fields is investigated in various bulk and boundary geometries and for various types of boundary conditions .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect is the dependence of the physical characteristics of the vacuum , like the energy density and stresses , on the geometry of the background spacetime .",
    "the evaluation of these characteristics requires the knowledge of a complete set of modes for a quantum field and exact results can be provided for highly symmetric bulk and boundary geometries only .",
    "in particular , motivated by the problems of the radion stabilization and the cosmological constant generation in braneworld models , the casimir effect for planar boundaries in anti - de sitter space has been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "higher - dimensional generalizations of the anti - de sitter background having compact internal spaces have been considered as well @xcite",
    ". another class of exactly solvable casimir problems corresponds to de sitter spacetime .",
    "various geometries of boundaries in this background have been considered @xcite . in inflationary",
    "coordinates the corresponding metric is time - dependent and , in general , in addition to the diagonal component , the vacuum energy - momentum tensor has a nonzero off - diagonal component that describes an energy flux along the direction normal to the boundary .",
    "the casimir effect for the electromagnetic field in the geometry of parallel conducting plates in friedmann - robertson - walker cosmologies with flat spatial sections and with power - law scale factors is discussed in bell13 .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the change in the properties of the scalar vacuum induced by a spherical shell with robin boundary condition on the background of a negatively curved constant curvature space .",
    "historically , the investigation of the casimir effect with a spherical boundary was motivated by the semiclassical model of an electron @xcite , where the vacuum quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are responsible for poincar stress stabilizing the charged particle .",
    "currently the configurations involving spherical boundaries are among the most popular ones in both the theoretical and experimental investigations of the casimir effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here , we are interested in combined effects of the gravitational field and spherical boundary on the local characteristics of the scalar vacuum",
    ". we shall consider a free field theory and in this case all the properties of the vacuum state are obtained from two - point functions .",
    "our choice of the positive - frequency wightman function is motivated by the fact that this function will also determine the response of a unruh  de witt detector ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . as local characteristics of the vacuum state",
    "we shall investigate the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the latter serves as a source in the right - hand side of semiclassical einstein equations and plays an important role in considerations of the back - reaction from quantum effects on the background geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : wf ] , we describe the bulk and boundary geometries .",
    "the positive - frequency wightman function is evaluated for the boundary - free space , inside and outside a spherical boundary . by making use of this function , in section [ sec : phi2 ] , the sphere - induced contribution in the vev of the field squared is evaluated and its properties are investigated in asymptotic regions of the parameters .",
