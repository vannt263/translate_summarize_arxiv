    "the observations in the section iv - b and iv - c indicate that the ivf and sd models fits some of the trends of the wavelength dependence on experimentally accessible parameters",

    "8(c ) and 8(d ) confirm that ion incidence at 25@xmath75 only produces surface features at the larger scale .",
    "furthermore , ion sputtering at normal incidence does not roughen the surface at all from the onset of irradiation , which is confirmed by a real - time gisaxs study .",
    "this is in contrast to the theoretical behavior which predicts that the ripple wavelength only increases slightly as normal incidence is approached . if the nonlinear terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 are introduced into the continuum equation describing the surface motion , kinetic roughening  @xcite is expected in the region i of the phase diagram ( when @xmath120 ) , but such roughening is not observed .",
    "these unusual effects lead us to propose that there is an additional smoothing mechanism that dominates the behavior near normal incidence .",
    "we have considered the fact that the theoretical ripple wavelength is very sensitive to the ion range @xmath21 , so that a small ( factor of two ) uncertainty in @xmath21 would have a large ( order of magnitude ) effect on the calculated wavelength for certain models .",
    "a factor that is not taken into account in srim simulations is the ion - channeling effect .",
    "@xcite ion channeling in crystalline surface layers would be strongest near low - index crystallographic directions , and could potentially lead to an increase in ion range @xmath21 near the [ 0001 ] axis , and a corresponding increase in ripple wavelength . based on rheed analysis of sapphire surfaces after ion bombardment at different temperatures , there is a striking increase in surface order at higher substrate temperatures , and we would expect a stronger channeling effect for the experiments at high temperatures than at low temperatures . however , fig .",
    "10 does not show any effect of temperature at the lowest angles of incidence , effectively refuting this idea .",
    "furthermore , the cutoff of ion - channeling by a low energy threshold in the range between 0.1 - 1 kev may weaken its possible influence on the formation of erosion patterns .",
    "@xcite    another important factor that is not taken into consideration by current models to explain surface morphology created by ion sputtering is ion impact induced lateral mass redistribution .",
    "@xcite it can induce a form of surface smoothing process that is different from the sd , ses or ivf relaxation mechanisms previously discussed .",
    "impact - induced downhill currents have been identified as the driving force underlying the ultra - smoothness of surfaces resulting from ion assisted film deposition .",
    "@xcite the ion induced lateral currents gives rise to curvature dependent ( @xmath121 ) smoothing terms , which can weaken or even cancel the curvature dependent roughening term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) [ see eq .",
    "( 6 ) in ref . 4 ] .",
    "no ripples can form under conditions where this type of smoothing term is dominant , since the wavelength dependence exactly matches that of the prevailing roughening mechanism .",
    "thus , the idea that this additional smoothing mechanism plays a role at low angles of incidence provides a route which may explain the anomalous wavelength - angle phase diagram in figs . 7 and 10 .",
    "we also note that the lateral current term is expected to be strongest at low angles of incidence .",
    "@xcite    the behavior of the ripple formation at high temperature can be explained reasonably by the sd model .",
    "however , another important fact observed in our experiments , but not discussed above , is that thermal annealing at 1000 k without ion irradiation does not produce any distinguishable decay of the amplitude of as - prepared ripples , in contrast with previous studies on si and ag surfaces .",
    "@xcite this indicates that the surface smoothing at high temperature is not by a type of surface diffusion that is purely thermally activated .",
    "rather , it is likely to involve to the creation of mobile species on the surface during ion bombardment",
    ". further work on the flux dependence of the @xmath13 at high temperature will assist us in clarifying the dominant creation process for mobile species underlying the ion - enhanced surface diffusion .",
    "in summary , the formation and characteristics of ripple morphologies on sapphire surfaces produced by ion sputtering are systematically investigated by _ in - situ _ gisaxs and _ ex - situ _ afm .",
    "the ripple wavelength can be modulated effectively in a wide range of 20 to 2000 nm by changing the ion incidence angle , ion energy and temperature .",
    "this phenomenon provides an easy route to fabricate nanostructured surfaces for exploring novel nanoscale phenomenon .",
    "the ivf and sd smoothing mechanisms are shown to play an important role in the formation of the sapphire ripple structure .",
    "the possible importance of impact - induced lateral currents as a smoothing mechanism should also be investigated further .",
