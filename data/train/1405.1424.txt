    "chern - simons - matter ( cs - matter or csm ) theories consist of a chern - simons gauge field coupled to a matter sector .",
    "it has been proposed that the large @xmath0 limit of certain field theories of this type is holographically dual to a class of exotic gravity theories with a tower of light higher - spin particles ( vasiliev theories of gravity ) .",
    "the duality has been proposed for both asymptotically ads@xmath2 @xcite and asymptotically ds@xmath2 backgrounds @xcite .",
    "it is of note that such conjectured boundary duals of de sitter space contain ghosts  matter fields with `` wrong '' statistics such as commuting fermions or anticommuting bosons .",
    "such cs - ghost theories violate the spin - statistics connection and are non - unitary in the euclidean sense : they are not reflection - positive .",
    "though the study of non - unitary statistical field theories may sound unusual , it is worth recalling that in statistical field theories the unitarity condition need not be a physical condition .",
    "indeed @xcite , furthermore , if de sitter space is to have a global holographic description as envisioned in @xcite , the dual theories living on late - time euclidean surfaces will be non - unitary . guided by these ideas , in this paper we perform a detailed study of certain properties of non - unitary cs - ghost models that may shed further light on the ds / cft correspondence .      in the remainder of this introduction",
    "we further motivate our study by discussing general aspects of ds / cft and some features of cs - matter theories . in sec .",
    "[ sec csg ] , we discuss the realm of possible cs - ghost models and introduce the actions of all the models that we will be studying in greater detail . in sec .",
    "[ sec t0 ] , we study the chosen models on @xmath5 . using two different approaches  perturbative computations in landau gauge and path - integral methods in the light - cone gauge  we demonstrate that the @xmath8 map works and that , by proxy , all correlators of relevant fermionic ghost theories can be `` bosonized '' into correlators of corresponding bosonic ghost theories .",
    "these results fit into a web of dualities encapsulated by fig .",

    "we find that both @xmath8 and bosonization are broken , but along the way we extend the previously available small-@xmath7 analysis to find new saddle points and small-@xmath7 bardeen - moshe - bander phase transitions @xcite for theories with both ordinary and ghost matter .",

    "it should be noted that the bosonization maps hold along the rg flow and not just at the endpoints where the arrows are displayed .",
    "similarly , for the bulk theories one can get from type a with mixed boundary conditions to type b with mixed boundary conditions by changing the parity - violating phase ( although not in the simple way stated in the legend ) . an analogous set of dualities exists for the even - spin vasiliev theories.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      gauge fields play a very important role in our understanding of the ads / cft correspondence . in the simplest examples we know of , where the cft is given by an ir fixed point of the world - volume theory on a stack of @xmath0",
    "d - branes , the gauge fields are nothing more than the order @xmath10 massless modes of the strings interconnecting the d - branes .    as a first example , consider the four - dimensional @xmath11 sym with gauge group @xmath12 . at strong ",
    "t hooft coupling , this theory is dual to ads@xmath13 in type iib string theory .",
    "the matter content of the theory consists of a vector multiplet containing the gauge field @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , six real scalars @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and the fermionic partners .",
    "all the fields transform in the adjoint .",
    "the bosonic part of the action is given schematically by @xmath18 ^ 2 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the @xmath12 field strength and @xmath20 is the gauge - covariant derivative .",
    "the theory contains a vast collection of single - trace ( gauge - invariant ) operators , the large majority of which have a conformal weight that is not protected by supersymmetry as the dimensionless t hooft coupling @xmath21 is taken to be large . , where terms are added to make @xmath22 traceless and symmetric and @xmath23 .",
    "these are dual to kaluza - klein modes on the @xmath24 in the bulk . ]",
    "this collection of operators manifests itself in the bulk as a collection of heavy closed string states whose mass @xmath25 in ads units goes as some power of @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the conformal weight of an operator dual to a bulk string state is @xmath26 . at weak coupling however ,",
    "when @xmath1 is small , the dependence on @xmath1 becomes a perturbative effect and the collection of operators no longer decouples from the light part of the spectrum .",
    "in three boundary dimensions , the yang - mills gauge coupling acquires dimensions and grows large in the deep ir .",
    "fixed points have been identified for ordinary gauge theories coupled to an @xmath0-component field in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "however , one can also construct ( super)-conformal field theories containing a cs gauge field ( with no ordinary two - derivative kinetic term for the gauge field ) coupled to matter .",
    "a simple example is given by the abjm model @xcite , a @xmath27 cs theory with levels @xmath28 and @xmath29 for each gauge group , and with @xmath30 supersymmetry .",
    "in addition to the vector multiplet , the theory contains a bifundamental chiral multiplet @xmath31 , where the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are fundamental ( anti - fundamental ) indices for each @xmath34 gauge group . at infinite @xmath28 ,",
    "the theory is dual to ads@xmath35 in type iia string theory . by turning on a magnetic @xmath36-flux on the @xmath37 ,",
    "the gauge group can be generalized to a @xmath38 group , and the resulting theory is known as the abj theory @xcite .",
    "notice that since the gauge field is no longer dynamical , there are no local single - trace operators of the form @xmath39 .",
    "there is , however , a large collection of local gauge - invariant single - trace operators of the form @xmath40 , where by the trace symbol we simply mean a sum over all repeated bifundamental indices .",
    "again , the conformal weight of a vast collection of such operators is not protected and can grow with an increasing t hooft coupling .",
    "these are dual again to heavy bulk string states .    in the limit where @xmath41 , the structure of single - trace operators changes significantly @xcite . the above strings of operators are better understood as multitrace operators of a single @xmath42 gauge theory , and the single - trace operators become simple bilinear pairs of the @xmath31 with the @xmath34 index summed over .",
    "this is the vector limit of the theory , which has been argued extensively to be dual to a higher - spin , parity - violating , bulk theory @xcite .",
    "gauge fields in these theories play a rather different ( perhaps somewhat more innocent ) role than they did in the four - dimensional case discussed above",
    ". they do not give rise to a large collection of single - trace local operators dual to bulk fields .",
    "instead they are there to guarantee the gauge invariance of the theory and constrain the structure of the actual set of local operators .    finally , it is important to point out that unlike the above two examples of theories with bulk duals , there are many cases where the cft has no weakly - coupled lagrangian description nor a marginal coupling that can be continuously taken to zero .",
    "in fact , the very intuition of the @xmath10 gauge fields being the light string modes on the stack of @xmath0 d - branes breaks down in ads@xmath43 vacua of m - theory appearing in the near horizon of a stack of m5-branes . indeed , eleven - dimensional m - theory does not have strings as fundamental degrees of freedom , and it is most likely that we can not understand such cfts as conventional gauge theories in any sense .",
    "the goal of ds / cft is to understand whether there exist cfts that describe ( globally ) an asymptotically de sitter universe ( see @xcite for an overview of issues regarding quantum de sitter space ) . though little is known about such cfts , there are some hints coming from simple bulk computations .",
    "for instance , the conformal weight of an operator dual to a bulk scalar field of mass @xmath44 in four dimensions is given by @xmath45 , and so a tachyonic field with @xmath46 would be dual to an operator with large real conformal weight .",
    "thus , in constructing ( meta-)stable de sitter spacetimes out of cfts that contain weakly - coupled dynamical gauge fields , one has to confront the fact that the tower of single - trace operators @xmath39 with increasing number of @xmath47 s ( and thus increasingly large real conformal weights ) will be dual to a tower of increasingly tachyonic bulk fields .",
    "though such a `` tachyonic catastrophe '' most clearly occurs for weakly coupled gauge theories , it is reasonable that it will occur at strong coupling as well .",
    "this suggests that the cfts related to asymptotically stable de sitter universes are of a different kind than standard gauge theories ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) , and one is lead to consider : ( i ) cfts that contain non - dynamical gauge fields , such as the three - dimensional csm theories with ghost matter , or ( ii ) more generally cfts that do not have a canonical weakly - coupled lagrangian description .",
    "the first case has led to some progress in the study of a class of cfts which are dual to four - dimensional asymptotically de sitter universes containing an infinite tower of higher - spin fields . in order to avoid the `` tachyonic catastrophe '' in the bulk , one has to further go to the deep abj limit in the boundary , where the theories are vector - like rather than matrix - like and the single - trace operators are simply bilinear in the matter fields .",
    "( this field - theoretic limit was analyzed in some detail in @xcite . )",
    "the cfts of interest in this context contain ghost - like matter fields transforming in the fundamental or antifundamental representation of a particular group , such as anticommuting scalar fields or commuting fermions .",
    "it has further been argued that they can be coupled to an _ ordinary _",
    "@xcite cs gauge theory , thereby giving rise to a family of cfts that are dual to a parity - violating family of bulk higher - spin ds theories .",
    "these cs - ghost theories will be the main focus of the present work .    in the second case , the task may amount to understanding how to extend the bootstrap problem to the non - unitary cfts dual to asymptotically de sitter bulk theories .",
    "the main challenge , as compared to the original bootstrap program , is the abandonment of unitarity as a requirement .",
    "( for two - dimensional cfts , however , one also has additional constraints due to modular invariance . ) instead , what comes into play is the condition of bulk unitarity , which at tree level is simply the requirement that the bulk lagrangian give rise to a hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "consider for instance the action of a massless scalar field with a quartic interaction about a fixed planar four - dimensional de sitter background ( with metric @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) : @xmath50 the index @xmath51 ranges over the spatial indices in the bulk .",
    "a hermitian hamiltonian for @xmath52 requires @xmath53 and stability requires @xmath54 .",
    "the late - time tree - level bunch - davies wavefunctional of the scalar as a function of the late - time profile @xmath55 to @xmath56 is given by : @xmath57 | = - \\ell^2\\_{ds}\\ !",
    "\\int \\d^3 { \\vec{x}}\\ , \\d^3 { \\vec{y } } \\left ( \\frac{6}{\\pi^2 } \\ , \\frac { \\varphi(\\vec{x } ) \\varphi(\\vec{y})}{|\\vec{x}-\\vec{y}|^6 } + \\lambda_4 \\ , \\ell\\_{ds}^2 \\ !",

    "( the calculation can also be viewed as an analytic continuation from euclidean ads@xmath2 @xcite . ) according to the ds / cft correspondence , @xmath63 $ ] is given by the partition function of a putative dual cft as a function of the source @xmath64 for the operator @xmath65 dual to @xmath52 : @xmath66 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{1}{n ! } \\int   \\d^3 { \\vec{x}}_1 \\ldots \\int \\d^3 { \\vec{x}}_n   \\ ; \\varphi(\\vec{x}_1 ) \\ldots \\varphi(\\vec{x}_n ) \\ ; \\langle \\mathcal{o}_\\phi(\\vec{x}_1 ) \\ldots   \\mathcal{o}_\\phi(\\vec{x}_n ) \\rangle\\_{cft}.\\label{pertds}\\ ] ] from the cft point of view , hermiticity of the bulk hamiltonian is thus related to reality properties in the correlation functions of the cft . for",
    "the field theory , odd terms in the sum will vanish by a @xmath67 symmetry . in this case , knowing the precise bulk action gives us the precise boundary correlators .",
    "one might imagine constructing a machine which takes as input complete cft data and outputs whether the cft can be dual to a bulk de sitter theory .",
    "a minimal task for this machine is to construct the bulk late - time correlation functions and check that they are consistent with a late - time bulk hamiltonian which is hermitian .",
    "we have illustrated how bulk unitarity constrains the boundary field theory in the simple case of a scalar field with quartic self - coupling , but the connection holds generally .",
    "an interesting example is a bulk theory admitting einstein - like gravitational interactions , such that tree - level correlators between other fields and the graviton are suppressed .",
    "boundary correlators involving the tree - level graviton correspond to tree - level correlators involving only the stress tensor .",
    "these will be real ( up to local terms ) for a four - dimensional bulk , so long as the coefficient of the two - point function is normalized to be negative definite .",
    "thus , even at the basic tree level we are confronted with the challenge of extracting from the cft the reality properties of the bulk couplings .",
    "we will leave a discussion of this approach to other work .",
    "finally , we would like to remark on the idea of defining the cft via an analytic continuation of some known cft dual to an ads theory .",
    "the typical issue that arises from the bulk theory , particularly in the case of supergravity , is that many couplings depend on the bulk cosmological constant and the continuation can lead to ghosts and tachyons .",
    "more abstractly , a cft is defined by the collection of conformal weights , spins , and ope coefficients @xmath68 obeying the ope associativity at the level of four - point functions .",
    "assume now that we have a consistent set of data @xmath68 defining some ads theory .",
    "it is unclear whether there exists an unambiguous procedure to analytically continue this data to some ds theory .",

    "it might seem natural the continued theory have an operator @xmath72 such that @xmath73 due to the continuation @xmath74 . however , this is not what occurs in higher - spin examples of de sitter holography , where we must also continue @xmath75 , thus leaving the conformal weights unchanged . ]",
    "the interest in csm holography  both ads and ds  has sparked a renewed interest in csm theories in their own right .",
    "early investigations of such models have been largely fueled by the novel understanding of ubiquitous properties of cs theory @xcite and by the interest in the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . among these early advances ,",
    "the one of greatest relevance for our work is the discovery that @xmath76 cs coupled to external bosonic sources ( i.e. level-@xmath28 cs theory with bosonic wilson lines in the fundamental representation of @xmath12 ) is dual via level - rank duality to the @xmath77 cs coupled to external fermionic sources ( i.e.  to cs theory with fermionic wilson lines , also in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "recent years have seen the emergence of the analogous `` bosonization '' statement for cs theories coupled to quantum matter @xcite .",

    "rich phase diagrams and duality structures have been discovered , and with this machinery at hand , it is natural to ask how the models conjectured to be dual to ds spaces fit into this intricate framework .",
    "as stressed in the previous subsection , the cfts of interest are theories in which a cs sector is coupled to a large number @xmath0 of `` ghost '' fields , i.e.  fields which violate the spin - statistics connection .",
    "these cs - ghost theories can be realized either via anticommuting bosons or via commuting dirac fermions . in this note",
    "we initiate a systematic taxonomy of these theories .",
    "we identify four cs - ghost models which , on an @xmath5 manifold , can be _ mapped _ to models of cs coupled to ordinary matter :    * the @xmath78 cs theory coupled to @xmath79 anticommuting bosons , mapped by @xmath4 to the ordinary @xmath80 cs - boson theory . *",

    "we expand on this in greater detail in appendix [ appendix spn ] , where we consider the  restricted @xmath82 \" cs theory with a compact gauge group .",
    "these mappings between field theories were originally conjectured in @xcite , with evidence for @xmath34 at infinite @xmath0 provided in @xcite .",
    "the case of a pure maxwell gauge theory case was proven in @xcite .",
    "we will present detailed computations and arguments supporting the general case for the four models listed above to _ all _ orders in @xmath0 and at all values of couplings .",
    "we will also show that the @xmath81 dualities in the two @xmath34 models break on nontrivial topology ( on @xmath6 in the limit of small @xmath7 ) at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "another natural duality to investigate is the bosonization map between bosonic and fermionic cs - ghost models .",
    "this duality is particularly interesting because there exists bulk evidence that it should hold , as the ds higher - spin gravities dual to the bosonic and the fermionic theory have been shown to be dual to each other @xcite . using the @xmath8 map and the fact that this bosonization was demonstrated for ordinary cs - matter theories @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that bosonization holds for @xmath34 and @xmath78 cs - ghost theories on @xmath5 .",
    "this is a novel example of bosonization for non - unitary theories .",
    "we then study the @xmath34 cs - ghost theories on @xmath6 in the limit of small @xmath7 , where we may no longer use the @xmath4 map , and we carefully examine the large-@xmath0 saddle - point structure .",
    "we find that bosonization fails to hold , with the dominant saddle in the bosonic theory being mapped to a sub - dominant saddle which is not expected to lie on the steepest descent contour in the fermion theory .",
    "we begin overviewing the family of theories that can be obtained by gauging a global symmetry of a vectorlike ghost model and coupling it to a a cs gauge sector .",
    "we are particularly interested in theories whose spectra of conserved currents correspond to even - spin ( minimal ) and all - spin ( non - minimal ) spectra of vasiliev fields in four dimensions .",
    "ungauged vector models with @xmath0 anticommuting bosons are highly constrained by the grassmannian nature of the fields .",

    ", the singlet content of the @xmath82 ghost model contains currents of odd spin , making it ineligible to be dual to the minimal ( even - spin ) vasiliev gravity . by restricting this model to just the `` real '' fields , a theory with a single conserved current of each even spin",
    "is obtained .",
    "on @xmath5 , this restricted @xmath82 ghost model can be viewed as an analytic continuation of the @xmath85 model ; they have the same conserved current content , and we call the resulting theory on @xmath3 the @xmath78 ghost model .    vector models with @xmath0 commuting fermions behave similarly .",
    "the @xmath34 commuting fermion theory has a single conserved current of each integer spin , while the @xmath78 commuting fermion has a single current of each even spin .    for each global symmetry group and choice of ghost spin ,",

    "for bosonic ghosts , these are the regular theory ( the free theory deformed by a marginal sextic term ) and the critical theory ( the wilson - fisher fixed point , or the ir limit of the free theory deformed by a relevant quartic term ) . for fermionic ghosts , we again have a regular theory ( free fermions , no marginal deformations ) and a critical theory ( the gross - neveu fixed point with a marginal cubic term , or the theory whose deformation by a quartic term flows to the free theory in the ir ) .",

    "we take both routes : first we perturbatively calculate the @xmath9-functions and demonstrate the conformality properties of the theories in question , and then we calculate the generating functional by directly integrating out matter . in both cases",

    "we closely follow and extend the analysis of @xcite to dynamical ( varying ) clumping points of eigenvalues ; this is a natural and ( as it turns out ) necessary move , if our goal is to study the wider perspective of the saddle point structure of cs - matter theories .",

    "this free energy can be written as this is rather suggestive ; in fact , we _ conjecture _ that the above expression could have been obtained as a partition function of worldlines of particles with thermal mass @xmath209 , minimized w.r.t .  this thermal mass , with the nontrivial @xmath209-dependence entering through the sum of all knots of the worldlines .",
    "in this picture , the sum over @xmath44 is a `` sum over instantons , '' each instanton being a worldline that wraps the thermal circle @xmath44 times ; the factor @xmath401 is presumably related to the value of the polyakov loop with @xmath44 windings .",
    "the differences from the commuting model are transparent in this framework : there is an overall minus factor due to the different sign of the functional determinant , and there is an additional phase factor for each new winding of the worldline around the @xmath7 due to the antiperiodic boundary conditions and the gauge holonomy . we leave the developing of this framework to future work .",
    "we now turn to the commuting fermion models . just as in the bosonic case , there are two models of interest : the regular fermion and the critical ( gross - neveu ) fermion with an added marginal deformation .",

    "the log term , upon integration and renormalization , gives in complete analogy with the bosonic case .",
    "the second term can not be evaluated using as simple an analogy . upon doing the matsubara sum and averaging over the gauge holonomy",
    ", this term is found to be we may drop all the absolute values .",
    "this is going to be self - consistent once @xmath194 is put on - shell , and at this point it is a necessary step ; after it is done , using the second schwinger - dyson equation , the integrand can be shown to equal @xcite in other words , this integrand is a total derivative , and with this valuable insight it is possible to regulate the integral above and retain only the cutoff - independent terms ( taking into account that @xmath410 ) , getting the final answer for the free energy to be again , the commuting case differs from the original , anticommuting case only by an overall minus sign and by a minus sign in the dilogarithm .",
    "in addition , the equation for the thermal mass , @xmath410 , turns out to be equivalent to @xmath411 , as it should be .",
    "both of these observations fit into our conjecture about the possible alternative derivation of these free energies by summing over particle worldlines and minimizing the sum w.r.t .  the particles self - energy .      as an example , let us examine the regular fermionic theory . in this case we set @xmath95 and the @xmath413-dependence drops out . for the gap equation to have solutions , the sign of @xmath414 must be chosen to be equal to the @xmath193 sign in the free energy .",
    "once this is done , there are only two saddle points left , and the dominant one must be chosen . in the case of the free regular fermion ( @xmath397 ) , the thermal mass goes to zero as @xmath415 at the dominant saddle point ( the one with @xmath416 ) , where the free energy is it is of note that , just like in the ordinary matter case , the free energy of free fermions at high temperatures remains distinct from the free energy of free bosons .",
