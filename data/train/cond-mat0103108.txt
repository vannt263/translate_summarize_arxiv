    "a number of phenomena in nature are characterized by a coexistence of different scales , usually described by power law distributions .",
    "this is the case of most phase transitions where at the critical point the correlation functions are scale invariant , as well as most fluid phases in highly developed turbulence where the velocity fluctuations are sensitive to a variety of eddies .",
    "power law distributions are also encountered in a number of biophysical settings as well as financial markets  @xcite .",
    "stable random phenomena with power law behaviors are usually described by lvy distributions , a consequence of the central limit theorem for scale - free processes .",
    "the simplest example is a random walk with a power law distribution for single independent steps , where the relative probabilities at different times are scale free .",
    "these phenomena lead to anomalous diffusion and intermittency as encountered in charge transport in amorphous semiconductors , moving interfaces in porous media , spin glasses , turbulence  @xcite and phase changes in chiral qcd  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that current market covariances are gaussian noise driven with possible consequences for the assessment of correlations in portfolio evolution and optimization  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the lower part of eigenvalue distribution of the sp500 covariance matrix constructed from the daily returns normalized by the local volatility , is gaussian noise dominated . in this paper",
    "we confirm some of these observations , but suggest that an alternative covariance constructed from the daily returns normalized to the initial price displays lvy noise throughout the spectrum .",
    "the latter is more robust against reshuffling and certainly requires a random lvy matrix description .",
    "this observation is overall consistent with a recent observation we made in the context of free random lvy matrices  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the concept of financial correlation matrices , and empirically analyze their statistical content .",
    "we show that all covariances display power law tails , albeit with different indices . in section 3",
    "we discuss the issue of inter - stock correlations and we define reshuffling of the price series and investigate its effects on the covariance matrices .",
    "we find that the covariance with the largest tails is the least sensitive to this process .",
    "this is discussed in section 4 , where we analyze the corresponding spectral densities and show that the results of random lvy matrices apply remarkably well to the covariance that is stable under reshuffling . in section 5",
    ", we analyze the bulk eigenvector content of the all covariances and parallel them with the results of reshuffling and lvy random matrix theory .",
    "the larger the tails , the stronger the localization seen in the participation ratios and the stock scattering . in section 6 , we formulate a simple model of price fluctuations , which reproduces most of the experimentally observed features of the sp500 covariances .",
    "our conclusions are in section 7 .",
    "one of the central problems in financial investment is the assessment of risk .",
    "standard lore suggests that risk can be reduced through assets diversification , with markowitz s portfolio analysis as one of the corner - stones in assets allocation and diversification  @xcite .",

    "the choice of the normalization @xmath9 to the initial price preserves the nature of the tails and is scale invariant .",

    "this is expected , since the fluctuations are roughly normalized to the typical fluctuation .",
    "this is not the case in @xmath10 , where the raw tail is retained .",
    "let us introduce yet another covariance matrix which will be convenient in the further analysis .",

    "this order , in particular preserves inter - stock correlations .",
    "we can suppress the inter - stock correlations in the data , by introducing a random time ordering to the time history for each asset .",
    "more precisely , for each asset , @xmath3 , we can generate a random permutation of @xmath5-indices @xmath55 . and instead of the historical ordered rows of returns we can use : @xmath56 , to define : @xmath57 and the corresponding covariance matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xmath60 , and @xmath61",
    ". the permutations for different rows , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , are random and mutually independent .",
    "such a reshuffling does not change the information content of the individual asset rows , because successive entries in the historical ordered row , @xmath54 and @xmath64 , are uncorrelated for typical time intervals on a market .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we see that the large eigenvalues disappear : the largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 was 41.95 , and for @xmath60 after reshuffling 2.77 . moreover , the * g * and @xmath61 spectra fit very well to the curve : ( ) ~1 [ fitgauss ] with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , predicted by random gaussian matrices ( rgm ) in the large @xmath4 limit  @xcite . in general for the asymmetry parameter @xmath76 , the formula predicts @xmath77 , which in particular for @xmath78 , yields the values given above .",
    "these values are used in the curve plotted in fig .",
    "this agreement clearly indicates that the normalization to the volatility @xmath15 used in @xmath11 brings the signal to the gaussian universality .",
    "it is worth noting that if one attempts to fit the rgm result to the eigenvalue histograms for a correlated data set one generally obtains values for @xmath79 , @xmath80 which deviate from the predicted ones .",
    "for example , for @xmath11 and @xmath51 for the historically ordered we get @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , respectively , this deviation comes as a compensation for the appearance of large eigenvalues which lie far away and corresponds to asymmetry parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the large eigenvalues survive reshuffling in @xmath10 covariances .",
    "moreover , the position of the larger eigenvalues is relatively stable under reshuffling .",
