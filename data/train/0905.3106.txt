    "entanglement , one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics @xcite , is undoubtedly an indispensable ingredient as a resource to any quantum computation or quantum communication scheme  @xcite .",
    "the ability to ( sometimes drastically ) outperform classical computations using multipartite quantum correlations has been demonstrated in various theoretical proposals which by now have become well known standard examples @xcite . due to the rapid progress in the fields of quantum computation , communication , and cryptography , both on the theoretical and the experimental side , it has become a necessity to quantify and study the production , manipulation and evolution of entangled states theoretically .",
    "however , this has turned out to be a rather difficult task , as the dimension of the state space of a quantum system grows exponentially with the number of qudits and thus permits the existence of highly nontrivial quantum correlations between parties . while bipartite entanglement is rather well understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the study of multipartite states ( with three or more qudits ) is an active field of research .",
    "several different approaches towards the study of entanglement exist .",
    "bell s original idea @xcite that certain quantum states can exceed classically strict upper bounds on expressions of correlators between measurement outcomes of different parties sharing the same state has been widely extended and improved to detect entanglement in a great variety of states .",
    "entanglement between photons persisting over large distances has been demonstrated with the use of bell - type inequalities ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another more recent approach is the concept of entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "these are observables whose expectation value is non - negative for separable states and negative for some entangled states .",
    "thirdly , the concept of entanglement measures is focussing more on the quantification of entanglement : if state @xmath1 has lower entanglement than state @xmath2 , then @xmath1 can not be converted into @xmath2 by means of local operations and classical communication .",
    "remarkably , there exist interesting relations between entanglement measures and bell inequalities @xcite on the one hand , and entanglement witnesses @xcite on the other hand . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the direct evaluation of entanglement measures .    among the many features one can demand of such a measure",
    ", monotonicity is arguably the most important one : an entanglement measure should be non - increasing under local operations and classical communication ( reflecting the fact that it is impossible to create entanglement in a separable state by these means ) .",
    "a measure exhibiting this property is called an entanglement monotone , with prominent examples being , e.g. , the entanglement of formation @xcite , the tangle @xcite , the concurrence @xcite or the measure by meyer and wallach @xcite . while one measure captures certain features of some states especially well",
    ", other measures focus on different aspects of different states .",
    "often , entanglement monotones are defined only for pure states and are given as analytical expressions of the state s components in a standard basis .",
    "unfortunately , quantifying mixed - state entanglement is more involved .",
    "this is somewhat intuitive , since the measure needs to be capable of distinguishing quantum from classical correlations . a manifestation of this difficulty is the fact that the problem of determining whether a given density matrix is separable or not is apparently very hard and has no known general solution for an arbitrary number of subsystems with arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the ability to study mixed - state entanglement is , however , highly desirable since mixed - states appear naturally due to various coupling mechanisms of the system under examination to its environment .",
    "there exists a standard way to construct a mixed - state entanglement monotone from a pure - state monotone , the so - called convex - roof construction @xcite , but the evaluation of functions obtained in this way requires the solution of a rather involved constrained optimization problem ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : convex - roof em ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present two algorithms targeted at solving this optimization problem numerically for any given convex - roof entanglement measure . in principle , these algorithms can also be applied to any optimization problem subjected to the same kind of constraints .",
    "the first algorithm is an extension of a procedure originally used to calculate the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "it is a conjugate gradient method exploiting the geometric structure of the nonlinear search space emerging from the optimization constraint .",
    "the second algorithm is based on a real parametrization of the search space , which allows one to carry out the optimization problem in the more familiar euclidean space using standard techniques .    in the second part of the paper , we use these algorithms in order to study the entanglement properties of a certain type of spin rings .",
    "these systems form a generalization to @xmath3 qubits of our previous study , where we had only considered the case @xmath4 @xcite . in the presence of an isotropic and ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction and local in - plane magnetic fields obeying a radial symmetry ,",
    "it can be argued ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : spin system ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the ground state becomes a local unitary equivalent of an almost perfect n - partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite @xmath5 we review how the evaluation of a convex - roof entanglement measure is related to a constrained optimization problem .",
    "we then develop and describe the numerical algorithms capable of tackling this problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : algorithms ] .",
    "we also present some benchmark tests , comparing our methods to another known algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin system ] , we describe the spin rings mentioned earlier and study their entanglement properties in terms of a convex - roof entanglement measure evaluated using our algorithms .",
    "we conclude our work in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "given a pure - state entanglement monotone @xmath6 , the most reasonable properties one can demand of a generalization of @xmath6 to mixed states are that this generalization is itself an entanglement monotone , and that it properly reduces to @xmath6 for pure states . a standard procedure which achieves this is the so - called convex - roof construction @xcite . given a mixed state @xmath7 acting on a hilbert space @xmath8 of finite dimension @xmath9 , it is defined as @xmath10 is the set of all pure - state decompositions of @xmath7 . note that the pure states @xmath11 are understood to be normalized .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath12 is hence defined as an optimization problem over the set @xmath13 .    in order to apply numerical algorithms to this problem",
    ", @xmath13 must be accessible in a parametric way .",
    "this parametrization is well - known and is often referred to as the schrdinger - hjw theorem @xcite , which we briefly outline here for the sake of completeness .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the set of all @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 with the property @xmath17 , i.e. , matrices with orthonormal column vectors ( hence we have @xmath18 ) .",
    "the first part of the schrdinger - hjw theorem states that every @xmath19 yields a pure - state decomposition latexmath:[$\\{p_i ,    matrix @xmath7 by the following construction .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 denote the eigenvalues and corresponding normalized eigenvectors of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath24 note that we have @xmath25 since @xmath7 is a density matrix and as such a positive semi - definite operator . given a matrix @xmath26 ,",
    "define the auxiliary states @xmath27 it is then readily checked that latexmath:[\\[\\begin{gathered } p_i = \\langle\\tilde\\psi_i|\\tilde\\psi_i\\rangle , \\\\    indeed a valid decomposition of @xmath7 into a convex sum of @xmath29 projectors .",
    "the second part of the theorem states that for any given pure - state decomposition @xmath30 of @xmath7 , there exists a @xmath19 realizing the decomposition by the above construction .",
    "this guarantees that by searching over the set @xmath31 and obtaining the decompositions according to the schrdinger - hjw theorem , we do not ` miss out ' on any part of the subset of @xmath13 with a fixed number of states @xmath29 .",
    "the parameterization is thus complete , i.e. , searching the infimum over @xmath14 is equivalent to searching over all decompositions with fixed so - called cardinality @xmath29 .",
    "this allows us to reformulate the optimization problem eq . as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the sum on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "obtained via the matrix @xmath34 from @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath35 note that we have dropped the @xmath7-dependence in the above expressions , since @xmath7 is fixed within a particular calculation and only the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath34 is of relevance in the following .",
    "it is clear that in a numerical calculation only a finite number of different values for @xmath29 can be investigated .",
    "however , it is also intuitive to expect that for some large enough value of @xmath29 , increasing the latter even further has only marginal effects .",
    "in fact , we have observed numerically that already @xmath37 yields very accurate results in all tests we have performed ( also in the ones presented in sec .  [ sec : test cases ] ) , and we have used this choice throughout all numerical calculations within this work .",
    "note that for a fixed value of @xmath29 , also all other decompositions with cardinality smaller than @xmath29 are considered as well , since the probabilities @xmath38 in the elements of @xmath13 are allowed to go to zero ( with the convention that the corresponding states @xmath11 are then discarded ) .",
    "since the algorithms presented in the next section will both be gradient - based , the derivatives of eq . with respect to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath34 evaluated at @xmath34 will be required at some point .",
    "we state them here for the convenience of the reader .",
    "they are given by    @xmath39,\\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial { \\mathop\\mathrm{im}}u_{kl } } & = \\label{partial h 2 } 2\\lambda_l{\\mathop\\mathrm{im}}(u_{kl})m(|\\psi_k(u)\\rangle ) + \\sum_{i = 1}^d\\left[{\\mathop\\mathrm{re}}\\phi^{(i)}_{i , kl } \\left.\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial { \\mathop\\mathrm{re}}\\psi^{(i)}}\\right|_{|\\psi_k(u)\\rangle } + { \\mathop\\mathrm{im}}\\phi^{(i)}_{i , kl } \\left.\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial { \\mathop\\mathrm{im}}\\psi^{(i)}}\\right|_{|\\psi_k(u)\\rangle}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40,\\\\    \\left[\\mathfrak{i}\\sqrt{p_k(u)\\lambda_l}|\\chi_l\\rangle - \\lambda_l{\\mathop\\mathrm{im}}(u_{kl})|\\psi_k(u)\\rangle\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and superscripts such as in @xmath41 denote the @xmath42th component of the state @xmath43 in an arbitrary but fixed basis .",
    "as a last remark , we would like to point out that the constraint set @xmath14 is , in fact , a closed embedded submanifold of @xmath44 , called the complex stiefel manifold @xcite .",
    "the geometric structure emerging thereof is exploited in one of the two algorithms following shortly .",
    "the dimension of the stiefel mainfold is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "since we have @xmath46 , we can set @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the number of free parameters @xmath3 in the optimization is thus @xmath49 .",
    "hence , @xmath3 grows linearly with @xmath50 , but quadratically with @xmath51 .",
    "numerical evaluation in larger systems will thus be restricted to low - rank density matrices .",
    "the flexibility of choosing @xmath50 is however less restricted . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath52 already yields satisfying results .",
    "the study of optimization problems on matrix manifolds is a rather new and still active field of research ( see @xcite and references therein ) . only recently ,",
    "two ready - to - use algorithms for minimization over the complex stiefel manifold have been presented @xcite . to our knowledge , these are the only general purpose algorithms applicable to generic target functions over @xmath14 found in the literature .",
    "one is a steepest descent - type method , the other one is of newton - type .",
    "we will compare the performance of the modified steepest descent algorithm , as it is referred to in the original work , with the methods presented in this section .",
    "we have found that our algorithms generally show better convergence properties in the cases we have examined .",
    "we will , however , not make use of the modified newton algorithm for the following reasons .",
    "the second derivatives ( as required by any newton - type algorithm ) of the function @xmath33 [ eq . ] are in general quite involved and their number grows quadratically with the size of @xmath34 .",
    "hence , they are very expensive to evaluate , even if one resorts to numerical finite differences .",
    "moreover , the good convergence properties of newton - type methods may only be expected in the very proximity of a local minimum .",
    "one therefore first typically employs gradient - based techniques to approach a minimum sufficiently enough .",
    "however , what ` sufficiently enough ' means in a particular case is often not known beforehand .",
    "we will later make use of a quasi - newton algorithm , which approaches local minima satisfyingly and shows strong convergence similar to newton methods automatically when being close enough to a minimum .      in ref .",
    "@xcite a conjugate - gradient algorithm on the unitary group @xmath53 was presented .",
    "the goal there was to calculate the entanglement of formation also for systems with dimensions different from @xmath54 @xcite . here",
    ", we extend this result by noting that the method is applicable to any optimization problem on @xmath55 , particularly to the evaluation of entanglement measures other than the entanglement of formation , and we calculate the required general expression of the gradient of @xmath33 .",
    "optimizing over @xmath55 instead of @xmath14 comes at the cost of over - parameterizing the search space .",
    "when using this algorithm to calculate convex - roof entanglement measures , we simply took into account only the first @xmath51 columns of the matrix obtained at every iteration .",
    "this is certainly an aspect one could improve upon in future research .",
    "the algorithm presented here is a conjugate gradient - type method , meaning that instead of simply going downhill , i.e. , in the direction of steepest descent , previous search directions are taken into account at the current iteration step .",
    "once the search direction @xmath56 at iteration step  @xmath42 , a skew - hermitian @xmath57 matrix , is known , a line search along the geodesic @xmath58 is performed , where @xmath59 is the current iteration point . in particular ,",

    "here we present an alternative approach to optimization problems over the stiefel manifold @xmath14 .",
    "we will obtain a parametrization of @xmath14 in terms of a set of real numbers which we will call euler - hurwitz angles , therefore unconstraining the optimization problem and mapping it to euclidean space , where optimization problems have been investigated for much longer .",
    "we will therefore be able to employ a standard algorithm to tackle the transformed problem eq . @xcite .",
    "the idea of parameterizing @xmath14 is somewhat motivated by a theorem known in classical mechanics , where it is stated that any rotation in three - dimensional euclidean space can be written as a sequence of three elementary rotations described by three angles , the euler angles .",

    "the success probability for the other three values of @xmath166 are between @xmath181 and @xmath182 , whereas they are between @xmath183 and @xmath184 for the parameterized quasi - newton algorithm .",
    "one can see , with the help of looking more detailed into the behavior of single runs ( see insets ) , that the averaged convergence plots are slightly flattened out due to some rather rare occurrences of slow convergence .",
    "still , one can observe that the parameterized quasi - newton method converges faster to good local minima .",
    "we would like to remark here that the parameterized quasi - newton method is also capable of determining whether two arbitrary mixed states are equivalent up to local unitary transformations . while this problem has an operational solution in some special cases ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) , there is no generally applicable operational criterion known capable of making this decision . using the parametrization developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : parameterization method ] , one can express each local unitary transformation @xmath59 in the matrix @xmath185 by its euler - hurwitz angles and optimize over the whole set of all angles simultaneously . furthermore , on can study in this way how ` close ' two mixed state are with respect to local unitary equivalence .",
    "note that such kind of analyses are not possible with the modified steepest descent or the generalized conjugate gradient methods , since , as there is no parametrization , one can optimize over only one unitary matrix at a time .",
    "in this section , we use the algorithms developed and described above to evaluate a multipartite mixed - state entanglement measure of a concrete physical system .      in the following , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath186 where @xmath187 , @xmath188 with @xmath189 being the standard pauli matrices acting on the @xmath42th spin , @xmath190 and the angles @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "equation describes a closed ring of @xmath193 equidistant exchange - coupled spin qubits with local in - plane magnetic fields @xmath194 which are chosen such that the system is invariant under rotations by multiples of @xmath195 about the center of the ring .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath196 is throughout assumed to be ferromagnetic ( i.e. , @xmath197 ) .",
    "the fields in eq . are chosen to point radially outwards , but the following discussion and results also hold for any other local in - plane field configuration possessing the same rotational symmetry , since all these systems are local unitary equivalents . the system is depicted schematically in fig .  [ fig : radial system 3 ]  ( a ) for three spins .",
    "in fact , we are considering here a generalization of one of the @xmath198 cases studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the particular field configuration resulted from semiclassical considerations with the goal of obtaining a state which is close to a ghz state [ see eq . ] as the ground state of the system . in that case ,",
    "entanglement can be created by merely cooling the system to low enough temperatures . in principle , the argumentation for the occurrence of a ghz ground state presented in ref .",
    "@xcite can be extended to a number of qubits @xmath199 .",
    "however , it can be expected that for @xmath200 , the lowest - lying multiplet becomes a continuous spectrum .",
    "hence , the question arises up to which numbers of spins @xmath3 this setup still allows generating ghz - type entanglement . before further investigating this question",
    ", we briefly restate the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite for the convenience of the reader .",
    "we start from the fact that in the ground state of the classical analog of the hamiltonian , all spins are aligned for @xmath201 .",
    "however , no direction of alignment is favored , reflecting the full rotational symmetry of the system in spin space .",
    "small local magnetic fields ( @xmath202 ) , applied in the way described above , break this symmetry and one is left with the two degenerate ground states @xmath203 and @xmath204 where the representation ( quantization ) axis is the usual @xmath205-direction .",
    "in fact , each spin is slightly tilted against its local magnetic field , but there is no _ globally _ favored direction of orientation , such as with , e.g. , a global spatially uniform magnetic field .",
    "note that this effect of tilting vanishes as @xmath206 . due to the zeeman term in eq .",
    "there is an energy barrier between any path connecting the two degenerate minima . in the quantum case ,",
    "tunneling through this barrier lifts the degeneracy between the ground states and one obtains a tunnel doublet .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath207 , the two lowest lying states are the generalized ghz states given in eq . .",
    "three spins @xmath208 are situated at the corners of an equilateral triangle and are ferromagnetically exchange - coupled with coupling strength @xmath196 .",
    "local radial in - plane magnetic fields @xmath209 ( shown as green arrows in the @xmath210-plane ) point radially outwards .",
    "as discussed in the text , any other in - plane field geometry obeying the same radial symmetry ( such as , e.g. , a ` chiral ' field looping around the triangle ) leads to equivalent results .",
    "( b ) classical energy surface @xmath211 of the system shown in the top panel .",
    "the ` mean ' angles @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( introduced in the top panel ) are well suited to characterize the state of the system since fluctuations around these angles are small for @xmath202 and sum to zero .",
    "the superimposed white line shows the perturbatively calculated energy barrier at @xmath214 [ see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , whereas the crosses are due to a corresponding numerical minimization of the energy . ]    as an illustration , we plot the energy surface of the classical three - spin system corresponding to eq . in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial system 3 ]  ( b ) .",
    "we have previously argued [ see ref .",
    "@xcite , especially the discussion leading to eq .",
    "( 2 ) therein ] that this energy can be expressed in terms of two ` mean ' spherical angles @xmath213 and @xmath212 [ cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : radial system 3 ]  ( a ) ] , since all spins will basically align in the present limit @xmath202 , up to small fluctuations which sum to zero and are chosen to minimize the total energy .",
    "one can nicely see how the out - of - plane configurations at @xmath215 and @xmath216 are energetically favored . for any value of @xmath213 , a path connecting the two minima has to overcome an energy barrier which scales as @xmath217 . in the figure , this barrier is displayed by the superimposed white line for the specific value @xmath214 .    independently of @xmath3 , we are generally confronted with the following problem if we want to achieve the systems considered here to be in a highly entangled state at non - zero temperature .",
    "on the one hand , the energy splitting between the ground state and the first excited state vanishes as @xmath218 goes to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "a perfect ghz state is obtained exactly in this limit . for increasing magnetic field ,",
    "the states continuously deviate from the maximally entangled ghz state , as can be imagined with the help of the classical picture , where the spins start to tilt .",
    "one therefore has to choose the strength of @xmath218 as a tradeoff between having a highly entangled ground state and separating this state in energy from the next higher state .    in order to find this optimal magnetic field strength at a given temperature @xmath219",
    "we evaluate a suited mixed - state entanglement measure on the system s canonical density matrix @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 is boltzmann s constant . when we studied the case @xmath4 in ref .",
    "@xcite we used the tangle [ see eq . ] as our pure - state measure of choice , since it is an entanglement measure for three qubits .",
    "the generalization to mixed states was done via the convex - roof construction eq . . here",
    ", however , we need a pure - state entanglement measure which is defined for any @xmath223 .      in principle",
    ", an exponentially increasing number of distinct entanglement measures is required to capture all possible quantum correlations in a general pure state of @xmath3 qudits .",
    "this may be viewed as the reason for the rather large number of proposals for multipartite entanglement measures that have been put forward over the last years .",
    "various insights about the structure and characterization of multipartite entanglement have been gained by studying such measures . for our purpose , we want to have a measure that is easy ( and fast ) to compute ( in particular , that is an analytic function whose complexity grows at most polynomially with @xmath3 ) , that captures the type of entanglement present in our system well , and that possibly has a nice ( physical ) interpretation .",
    "we found that the meyer - wallach measure @xcite , defined for an arbitrary number of qubits , fulfills all these criteria . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be written in the compact form @xmath224,\\ ] ] where @xmath225 is the density matrix obtained by tracing out all but the @xmath29th qubit out of @xmath226 .",
    "this is simply the subsystem linear entropy averaged over all bipartite partitions involving one qubit and the rest @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that this entanglement measure is experimentally observable by determining a set of parameters that grows linearly with @xmath3 , in contrast to the exponentially increasing complexity of quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "we note at this point that the meyer - wallach entanglement has been generalized to a broader family of entanglement measures @xcite that might give deeper insight into the structure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "however , we stick to the simple form for our numerical calculations , as this measure turns out to describe our type of entanglement well .        the meyer - wallach measure is an entanglement monotone ( and can thus be extended to mixed states via the convex - roof construction ) , lies between zero and one , vanishes only for full product states ( i.e. , states of the form @xmath227 ) , and is maximal for generalized ghz states eq . .",
    "the upper bound is however also reached by other states , for instance by the so - called cluster states @xcite .",
    "a drawback of the meyer - wallach measure is that it can also be maximized by partially separable states .",
    "for example , the state @xmath228 although it is clearly not globally entangled @xcite .",
    "this is however not a problem in our study for two reasons .",
    "first of all , we can check by numerical diagonalization that the ground state of our systems indeed converges to a multiparite ghz state ( at least for the first few @xmath229 ) .",
    "secondly , comparing the data for @xmath4 with our earlier study in ref .",
    "@xcite where we had employed the tangle , we find the same qualitative behavior of both entanglement measures .",
    "moreover , the optimal values of @xmath218 for which the measures reach their maxima at a given temperature coincide almost perfectly .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the meyer - wallach entanglement measure is well suited for quantifying entanglement in our systems .    the numerical evaluation of the meyer - wallach measure extended to mixed states via the convex - roof construction requires the derivatives of @xmath230 with respect to the real and imaginary components of @xmath43",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ partial h 1 ] , [ partial h 2 ] ) ] .",
    "due to the partial traces , these expressions are a bit cumbersome .",
    "however , exploiting the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian studied here , they can be considerably simplified ( see appendix ) .",
    "before we present and discuss our numerical results , we would like to mention that studying the system eq .",
    "analytically for arbitrary @xmath3 is rather difficult .",
    "an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian is not known for arbitrary @xmath3 , and perturbation theory to constant order in @xmath218 ( independent of @xmath3 ) is not suitable to study the ground - state properties of the system , since the ground - state splitting is lifted only in @xmath3-th order .",
    "one can can thus generally expect that the ground - state splitting scales with the number of spins as @xmath231 .",
    "since we must always have @xmath232 , this goes to zero for large @xmath3 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin rings ] above . obtaining highly entangled states at finite temperature with this approach will thus be increasingly difficult for an increasing number of spins @xmath3 .",

    "figure  [ fig : radial entanglement ] shows the meyer - wallach measure for @xmath233 , and @xmath234 spins at four different temperatures ( see caption of the figure ) . each data point is the result of whichever of the two algorithms described in sec .",
    "[ sec : algorithms ] performed better in a few trials with random initial conditions .    for a fixed number of spins , the entanglement as a function of the magnetic field strength @xmath218 assumes a maximum .",
    "this maximal entanglement @xmath235 is increased and its position is shifted to smaller magnetic field values as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this is due to the fact that at low temperatures , only a small magnetic field is required in order to make the ground - state splitting sufficiently large compared with temperature . since these small field values only slightly disturb the ideal ghz configuration , almost maximal values of the entanglement measure ( corresponding to almost perfect ghz - states ) are observed .",
    "with higher temperature , larger field values are required to protect the ground state .",
    "consistent with the semiclassical picture , this perturbs the desired spin configuration and leads to a lower amount of entanglement .",
    "for large magnetic fields , all curves coincide eventually , as the system is always found in the ground state in that case .",
    "figure  [ fig : maximal entanglement ] gives more insight into the dependence of maximal entanglement @xmath235 on temperature and the number of particles .",
    "the plot was obtained by maximizing the meyer - wallach measure over the magnetic field strength @xmath218 while holding the temperature fixed .",
    "displayed is the difference between the resulting data to the zero - temperature maximum ( being equal to @xmath164 ) as a function of temperature for different numbers of particles ( see caption of the figure ) .",
    "clearly , the maximally achievable entanglement @xmath235 decreases for both increasing temperature and increasing number of particles .",
    "the qualitative dependence on the temperature was discussed already above . here",
    "we additionally see an almost linear behavior on a log - log scale at low temperatures , suggesting a power - law decay of the maximal entanglement of the form @xmath236 with an exponent @xmath237 depending on the number of particles @xmath3 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath235 with the number of spins @xmath3 at fixed temperature is due to the fact that the energy splitting between the ground and first excited state scales as @xmath231 . with a larger number of particles , a higher magnetic field is required to achieve a sufficiently large splitting .",
    "this in turn lowers the entanglement in the ground state , due to its @xmath218-dependence , resulting in a lowered maximum of the meyer - wallach measure .",
    "as an additional obstacle , the ground - state entanglement as a function of @xmath218 decays even more rapidly as the number of particles is increased .",
    "this can be seen from the inset of figure  [ fig : maximal entanglement ] , where , at @xmath238 , the @xmath218-values yielding the meyer - wallach measure @xmath239 ( full width at half maximum , since the maximum at @xmath238 is always @xmath164 ) are shown as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we have presented two ready - to - use numerical algorithms to evaluate any generic convex - roof entanglement measure .",
    "while one is based on a conjugate gradient algorithm operating directly on the search space , the other one is a quasi - newton procedure performing the search in the transformed unconstrained euclidean space .",
    "all required formulas to implement either of the two algorithms have been stated explicitly , which , in order to calculate different convex - roof extended pure - state measures , merely leaves the user with the task of calculating its derivatives with respect to the real and imaginary components of the pure - state argument .",

    "we have confirmed this argumentation by evaluating the mixed - state meyer - wallach entanglement measure , defined for an arbitrary number of qubits , and found indeed high values of entanglement at low temperatures and specific magnetic field strengths .",
