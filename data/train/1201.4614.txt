    "understanding the nature of dark matter ( dm ) and the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) are two of the most important questions in both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the standard model ( _ sm _ ) of the electroweak and strong interactions , fails in providing an explanation to these puzzles , which motivates for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "further excitement came from the recent signal reported by cogent , which favors a light dark matter ( ldm ) with mass in the range of @xmath4 gev and nucleon scattering cross - section around @xmath5 pb @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    with few exceptions ,",
    "most of the sm extensions make no attempt to address these two puzzles within the same framework .",
    "one of the exceptions is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in which the neutral lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a candidate for dm whereas the the bau can , in principle , be generated via the sphaleron processes when the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is strongly first order .",
    "however , systematic studies of the effective potential show that in order to have a strongly first order ewpt , the light stop and the lightest cp even higgs must have masses smaller than @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 gev , respectively @xcite . on top of that , all the other squarks and sleptons are heavier than a few tev , putting the original naturalness motivation under pressure .",
    "thus , the electroweak baryogenesis in the mssm is severely constrained .",
    "also , the lsp with a mass around @xmath8 gev and an elastic scattering cross - section off a nuclei larger than @xmath9 pb requires a very large @xmath10 and a relatively light cp - odd higgs .",
    "this choice of parameters leads to a sizable contribution to the branching ratios of some rare decays , which then disfavors the scenario of light neutralinos @xcite .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , with @xmath11 input parameters , can enhance the strength of the ewpt without the need for a light stop @xcite .",
    "however , to have a ldm with an elastic scattering cross - section , that is capable to generate the cogent signal , is only in a finely tuned region of the parameters where the neutralino is mostly singlino and the light cp even higgs is singlet - like with mass below few gev @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is very difficult to detect such a light higgs at the lhc .",
    "on the other hand , if the lightest higgs is sm - like , it was shown that the nmssm is incompatible with the cogent data @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a simple and conservative extension of the sm with two real singlet scalar fields that possess a dark matter candidate lighter than 20 gev and a strongly first order ewpt .",
    "in addition , it has the following interesting features :    * 1 ) * there is a parameter space that can accommodate the cogent signal .    * 2 ) * the dm masses in the range of @xmath12 gev , have a relatively large dm elastic scattering cross - section , which makes them within the reach of near future direct detection experiments .    *",
    "3 ) * the light cp even scalar has mass in the range of @xmath13 gev , and still consistent with the lep data . whereas the heavy one has mass in the range of @xmath14 gev , while compatible with the electroweak precision tests .    *",
    "4 ) * for dm mass in the range of 1.8 to 2.1 gev , the predicted decay rate of @xmath3 is greater than the sm background , and can be accessible to super b - factories .",
    "we extend the sm by adding two real , spinless and @xmath15-symmetric fields : the dark matter field @xmath16 for which the @xmath15 symmetry is unbroken and another scalar field @xmath17 for which its @xmath15 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "both fields are sm gauge singlets and hence can interact with ` visible ' particles only via the higgs doublet @xmath18 .",
    "the tree - level scalar potential that respects @xmath15-symmetries is given by @xcite@xmath19@xmath20 the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and @xmath15 symmetries introduces the two vacuum expectation values @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . can still be generated by quantum correction @xcite ] with the value of @xmath21 being fixed experimentally to 246 gev , the model will have eight independent parameters .",
    "however , the dm self - coupling constant @xmath23 does not enter the calculations of the lowest - order processes of this work , so effectively , we are left with seven input parameters .",
    "the minimization condition of the one - loop effective potential allows one to eliminate @xmath24 and @xmath25  in favor of @xmath26 .",
    "the physical cp even scalars ( @xmath27 ) with eigenmasses ( @xmath28 ) , are related to the excitations of the neutral component of the sm higgs doublet field , * *  * * @xmath29 * , * and the field @xmath30 ; through the mixing angle @xmath31 . in our analysis",
    "we require that ( i ) all the dimensionless quartic couplings to be @xmath32 for the theory remains perturbative , ( ii ) and chosen in such a way that the ground state stability is insured , and ( iii ) the dm mass to be lighter than 20 gev .",
    "in order to investigate the nature of the ewpt , we calculate the one - loop corrections to the tree - level potential coming from the loops of the top quark , the gauge fields , the higgs doublet , the goldstone bosons , and the extra singlet scalars .",
    "the one - loop effective potential at zero temperature is given in the @xmath33 scheme by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a renormalization scale which we take to be at the top quark mass , @xmath36 are the field dependent squared masses , and @xmath37 are the fields multiplicities : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the finite temperature part of the effective potential @xcite , including the so called daisy diagrams @xcite , is given by@xmath43^{3/2}-m_{i}% ^{3}(\\tilde{h},\\tilde{\\chi}_{1})\\right\\ }   , \\label{vt}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the thermal masses . in the daisy contribution , the summation is only performed over the scalar and longitudinal gauge fields degrees of freedom .    in order to preserve the generated net baryon asymmetry from being erased by the @xmath46 violating sphaleron processes below the critical temperature @xmath47 , requires that the ewpt has to be strongly first order @xcite @xmath48 this criterion must hold in all extensions of the sm and in particular the ones with extra singlet fields @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ vac ] the dependance of the vevs on the temperature around @xmath47 .",
    "unlike the sm , the position of the wrong vacuum @xmath49 evolves with the temperature in such a way that the value the effective potential is shifted up with respect its value at @xmath50 .",
    "this will result , compared to the sm , in a decrease in the critical temperature , which makes the ratio ( [ v / t ] ) larger , and therefore the ewpt stronger . in fig .",

    "if the recent experimental hint of a @xmath108 from the lhc @xcite and tevatron @xcite measurements is confirmed , it implies that the electroweak phase transition in our model is not first order .",

    "the lep put strong constraints on the scale factor @xmath110 , which relates the production cross - section for @xmath61 to the sm one , and the reduction factor @xmath111 here , @xmath112 is the branching fraction of the light cp even scalar decaying into any kinematically allowed sm particles , and @xmath113 is its sm total decay rate . in our model ,",

    "it may still be possible for the atlas and cms detectors to discover such a heavy higgs .",
    "clearly , this deserve a detailed study @xcite .    before closing this section",
