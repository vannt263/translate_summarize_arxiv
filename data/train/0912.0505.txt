    "we investigate the extent to which these invariants determine the dynamics of the polynomial @xmath9 on its basin of infinity .    this study is partly motivated by a desire to understand the _ shift locus _ in the moduli space , the set of polynomials @xmath9 where all critical points lie in @xmath10 . in the shift locus , the conformal conjugacy class of a polynomial is uniquely determined by its restriction to the basin of infinity , and all such polynomials",
    "are topologically conjugate on their julia sets .",
    "the shift locus has complicated topology , which can be seen in the rich variation of the global dynamics of these polynomials @xcite , and there is currently no known invariant which classifies its topological conjugacy classes . in a sequel , we provide a combinatorial method to complete the classification of polynomial dynamical systems restricted to their basins of infinity . here",
    "we concentrate on the general topological features of conjugacy classes and how they fit together in the moduli space .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the space of conformal conjugacy classes of polynomials @xmath5 of degree @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the _ critical heights map _ @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the escape - rate function of @xmath9 , and @xmath15 are the critical points of @xmath9 , ordered so that @xmath16 .",
    "note that the connectedness locus @xmath17 , consisting of all polynomials with connected julia set , is the fiber of @xmath2 over the origin in @xmath18 .",
    "consider the subset @xmath19 of @xmath18 .",
    "we begin with the following observation :    [ thm : surjective ] the critical heights map @xmath20 is continuous , proper and surjective .",
    "the continuity and properness of @xmath2 are well - known , following easily from @xcite .",
    "surjectivity follows from basic properties of analytic maps , as @xmath2 is pluriharmonic where the critical points @xmath21 can be consistently labeled and have positive heights .",
    "details are given in  [ polynomials ] .",
    "we study the decomposition of @xmath0 into connected components of the fibers of @xmath22 .",
    "this critical - heights decomposition is related to twisting deformations on the basin of infinity :    [ generic fibers ] for generic values of @xmath23 , the fiber of @xmath2 is a finite , disjoint union of smooth @xmath24-dimensional tori ; each connected component coincides with a twist - deformation orbit .",
    "in particular , the connected components of a generic fiber are precisely the topological conjugacy classes of polynomials within that fiber .",
    "the generic values of theorem [ generic fibers ] have a precise characterization : we show that a value @xmath25 of @xmath2 satisfies the conclusion of theorem [ generic fibers ] if and only if @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "dynamically , these generic critical heights correspond to polynomials in the shift locus with all critical points in distinct foliated equivalence classes .",
    "the _ twist deformation _ , introduced in @xcite , is a quasiconformal deformation of the basin of infinity of a polynomial which twists its fundamental annuli and preserves its critical heights ; the turning curves of @xcite are a special case .",

    "map ( one whose fibers are totally disconnected ) ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem i.4.3 ) .",
    "below , we apply this to the critical heights map .",
    "the critical heights map factors as a composition of continuous , proper , and surjective maps @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the space of conformal conjugacy classes of polynomials restricted to their basins of infinity , introduced in @xcite , and @xmath6 is the space of polynomial trees introduced in @xcite .",
    "we remark that this space @xmath6 differs somewhat from its original definition , in that we have included the unique _ trivial tree _ associated to polynomials with connected julia set .",
    "[ sec : trees ] for details",
    ".    the main result of @xcite states that the projection @xmath33 is monotone , meaning that its fibers are connected . on the other hand , the critical heights map on the space of trees @xmath34 is light ( lemma [ thfibers ] ) .",
    "the fibers of the projection @xmath35 can be disconnected , and the reason is not too surprising . in forming the tree @xmath4 of a polynomial @xmath9 , connected components of the level sets of @xmath36",
    "are collapsed to points , thus `` forgetting '' the complicated planar graph structure of the singular components .",
    "we give explicit examples in the sequel @xcite , but we remark here that even for generic height values in degree @xmath37 , there are distinct topological conjugacy classes of polynomials with the same tree .",
    "we define @xmath38 to be the quotient space of @xmath0 obtained by collapsing connected components of the fibers of @xmath2 to points ; it is a parameter - space analog of the tree for a single polynomial . the fact that @xmath34 is light implies that we obtain a new sequence of continuous , proper , surjective maps @xmath39 through which the critical heights map @xmath2 must factor . by construction",
    ", the quotient space @xmath3 is the unique monotone - light factor for @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the fibers of @xmath40 are connected ( and , in fact , always contain a non - degenerate continuum ) , while the fibers of @xmath41 are totally disconnected .",
    "moreover :    [ thm : tstartfibers ] the fibers of the projection @xmath42 are totally disconnected ; the fibers are finite over the shift locus in @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , for each @xmath43 , the fiber over the unique tree with uniform critical heights @xmath44 is a single point .    from the definitions we deduce :",
    "the space @xmath3 is the unique monotone - light factor for the tree projection map @xmath45 .",
    "the objects of the space @xmath38 are at present somewhat mysterious ; the notation @xmath3 has been chosen because elements should represent polynomial trees , augmented by a certain amount of combinatorial information which is finite ( though unbounded ) over the shift locus .",
    "the extra information needed to specify an element of @xmath38 from the corresponding element of @xmath6 is the subject of @xcite . in particular , we provide examples which show that the projection @xmath42 is a bijection if and only if @xmath46 . theorem [ generic fibers ] shows that @xmath3 is generically the orbit space for the twisting deformation ; in @xcite we showed that the full space @xmath3 can be interpreted as the _ hausdorffization _ of the twist - orbit space .",
    "the branner - hubbard stretching operation , while not continuous on all of @xmath0 , nevertheless descends to a well - defined , continuous action of @xmath47 on each of the quotient spaces in ( [ space sequence ] ) , which is free and proper on the complement of the connectedness locus ( lemma [ lemma : stretching_continuous ] ) . the @xmath47-actions are equivariant with respect to the projection maps in ( [ space sequence ] ) .",
    "the heights map @xmath2 satisfies @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "the connectedness locus of each quotient space is the unique fixed point of the stretching action , and it is the limit of every orbit as @xmath50 decreases to @xmath51 . we obtain :    [ thm : cone ] the stretching operation induces a cone structure on each of the spaces @xmath32 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath52 .",
    "specifically , they are cones over the compact sets @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , consisting of points with maximal critical escape rate equal to @xmath57 , with origin at the connectedness locus .",
    "because of the cone structure , there is a natural _ projectivization _ of each quotient space of @xmath0 in ( [ space sequence ] ) , identified with the slice with maximal critical height 1 . for the space of trees",
    "@xmath6 , this projectivization is the space @xmath58 of @xcite .    in @xcite , we introduced a deformation of polynomials which  flows \" critical points upward along external rays until they reach the height of the fastest escaping critical point .",
    "while this can not be canonically defined on @xmath59 or @xmath53 ( even in the shift locus , due to the collision of external rays ) , the ambiguity is avoided when passing to the quotient space @xmath3 . using this upward flow ,",
    "we deduce :    [ thm : contractible ] the projectivization @xmath7 is compact and contractible .    the corresponding statement for the projectivized space of trees @xmath58 was proved in @xcite .",
    "the shift locus in each of the spaces of ( [ space sequence ] ) is the subset of points with all critical heights positive .",
    "it forms a dense open subset of each of these quotient spaces of @xmath0 .",
    "restricting to the shift locus yields a sequence of surjective proper maps @xmath60 the first map is a homeomorphism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , and @xmath61 is the subset of @xmath52 with all coordinates positive .",
    "each of the spaces in ( [ eqn : shift_chain ] ) is stratified by the maximal number of independent critical heights , where positive real numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 are _ independent in degree @xmath64 _ if there is no integer @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",

    "in this section we define the moduli space @xmath0 and present some basic properties of the critical heights map @xmath23 .",
    "we prove theorem [ thm : surjective ] , showing that @xmath2 is surjective .",
    "every polynomial @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , is conjugate by an affine transformation @xmath89 to a polynomial which is monic ( @xmath90 ) and centered ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the monic and centered representative is not unique , as the space of such polynomials is invariant under conjugation by @xmath92 where @xmath93 . in this way",

    "it is sometimes convenient to work in a space with marked critical points .",
