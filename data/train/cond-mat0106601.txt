    "in mesoscopic samples there is a competition between a triangle configuration of the vortex lattice as being the lowest energy configuration in bulk material ( and films ) and the boundary which tries to impose its geometry on the vortex lattice .",
    "for example a circular geometry will favour vortices situated on a ring near the boundary and only far away from the boundary its influence diminishes and the triangular lattice may reappear .",
    "therefore , it is expected that different geometries will favour different arrangements of vortices and will make certain vortex configurations more stable than others",
    ". in small systems vortices may overlap so strongly that it is more favourable to form one big giant vortex .",
    "the latter will preferably have a circular geometry . as a consequence",
    "it is expected that the giant to multivortex transition will be strongly influenced by the geometry of the boundary as will be also the stability of the giant vortex configuration .",
    "these issues , the dependence of the stability of the giant vortex configuration and of the different multivortex configurations on the geometry of the sample will be investigated in the present paper . as an example",

    "multivortex states in disks @xcite and rings @xcite were predicted .",
    "it was found that if the disk or the ring is large enough , the giant vortex nucleates into a multivortex state in which the vortices are situated on a ring . in a ring geometry , we found that breaking the circular symmetry through a non - central location of the hole favors the multivortex state @xcite .",

    "recently , bona and kabanov @xcite studied thin superconducting squares using the nonlinear ginzburg - landau theory in the @xmath1 limit . within this non - linear theory",

    "we consider superconductors of finite thickness and study also the vortex configurations deep inside the superconducting state , i.e. far from the superconducting / normal boundary .",

    "not only the stability region of the multivortex states with respect to the giant vortex states depends on the sample geometry , but also the stability of each individual superconducting state is sensitive to the geometry . in fig .",
