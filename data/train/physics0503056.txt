    "calculated essentially in the same way , these analyses receive different names : waiting time distribution , interocurrence time statistics , distribution of interspike intervals , distribution of laminar phases , etc . through a unified perspective , we discuss the main properties of these statistical methods , which allows us to reinterpret and specify many previous results . by a careful discussion of the relevance of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the time series data we can easily understand and , in a particular case , reject results on earthquake statistics ( sec .",

    "[ sec.iii ] ) . before reporting these results",
    "we start with a proper definition of time series recurrence times , we compare it to the poincar recurrences and we discuss briefly some important recent applications of the recurrence time analysis .",

    "the recurrence time statistics ( rts ) is obtained as the distribution @xmath8 of the sequence of recurrence times  @xmath5 .",
    "evidently , the sequence of recurrence times generated this way depends sensitively on the choice of @xmath3 , which in fact will be one prominent issue of this paper .",

    ", the famous poincar recurrence theorem asserts that almost all trajectories ( except for a set of zero measure ) started inside some subset @xmath17 of the phase space @xmath18 will return to it infinitely many times . in the limit of vanishing volume of this subset ,",
    "the time between consecutive recurrences is the poincar recurrence time . despite the well known debates about the foundations of statistical mechanics ( zermello paradox ) these ideas motivated throughout the years also mathematical studies  @xcite and , more recently , applications of recurrence analysis to many different dynamical systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "surprisingly , as far as we know , no connection between the two recurrence approaches described above were made until now .",
    "the most evident way to establish this relationship is to define an observable @xmath19 , when @xmath20 is the trajectory in phase space of the hamiltonian system .",
    "the recurrence volume @xmath17 is mapped to an interval @xmath21 on the real axis by the observation function @xmath22 .",
    "however , the sequence of recurrence times of the series @xmath23 with respect to @xmath21 is generally _ not _ identical to the sequence of poincar recurrences of @xmath24 with respect of @xmath17 , since there is usually a large set @xmath25 which also maps to @xmath21 due to the non - invertibility of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , generally @xmath21 will be of the kind of @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 .",
    "however , as we will show in this paper , the analogy with poincar recurrences motivates issues related to the recurrence times of extreme events which will reveal fundamental insight into their properties .",
    "two main results will be the lack of invariance of the rts under change of the observable and the fact that long - term correlations are _ not _ fully characterized by the autocorrelation function .",
    "the recurrence time between extreme events was recently used in the analysis of different experimental time series  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important examples of this analysis , which is going to be discussed later in this paper , is the study of the waiting time between earthquakes or avalanches in models exhibiting self - organized criticality ( soc ) .",
    "the idea of studying recurrences in soc started with the first connections between soc and earthquakes  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the investigation of seismic catalogs of different regions of the globe indicate the existence of a universal distribution of recurrence times between big earthquakes  @xcite , which may be roughly described as a power - law distribution @xmath29 followed by a faster decay .",
    "simple soc models have a poisson ( exponential ) distribution of recurrence times , what was used as argument against the use of soc to model not only earthquakes  @xcite but also ( and originally ) solar flares  @xcite .",
    "however , non - poissonian distributions are obtained in more sophisticated soc models  @xcite , what keeps open the debate over the use of soc in these fields , with the rts as one of its central ingredients .      if time series data @xmath30 are exponentially ( short range ) correlated , the rts is well known to be poissonian , i.e. , exponential for all  @xmath1 , independent of the choice of @xmath3 ( in the limit of small interval  @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "the same result applies to poincar recurrences ( including independence of @xmath17 ) if the underlying dynamics is hyperbolic , i.e. , in well defined mathematical way fully chaotic  @xcite .",
    "also in this case , correlations decay fast .",
    "hence , for systems with an exponential decay of correlations , details of defining recurrence times and further details of the system are irrelevant ; instead there exists a unique rts .",
    "many time series data have been found to be long - term correlated , i.e. , their mean autocorrelation time diverges  @xcite .",
    "typically , this situation is characterized in the time series @xmath30 ( assuming @xmath32 ) by the exponent  @xmath33 of the power - law decay of the autocorrelation function as a function of the time  @xmath34 @xmath35 in a recent paper  @xcite , bunde et al .",
    "analyzed the effect of long - term correlations on the return periods of extreme events , i.e. , of recurrence times obtained using recurrence intervals of type ( [ eq.q ] ) .",
    "the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite for long - term correlated time series can be summarized by the following three points . while the first was obtained considering statistical arguments , the two others were based on numerical simulations . + _ ( i ) _ the mean recurrence time is equal to the inverse of the fraction of extreme points in the series @xmath36 _ ( ii ) _ the statistics of  @xmath1 follows a stretched exponential @xmath37 where @xmath38 is identical to the correlation exponent in eq .",

    "( [ eq.bunde ] ) is established only for the class of the model data chosen there , the reproduction of these findings for empirical data  @xcite suggests some generality of the stretched exponential distribution . here , the link to poincar recurrences shows the opposite : hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space are long - term correlated and show power - law tails in the statistics of poincar recurrence times  @xcite . in this case , the long - term correlations are originated by the stickiness of chaotic trajectories near the border of integrable islands .",
    "they cause a kind of intermittent dynamics and manifest themselves in complicated higher - order temporal correlations .",
    "in fact , the temporal properties of typical data are _ not _ fully specified by the autocorrelation function , eq .",
    "( [ eq.correlation ] ) , what explains why there can not be a unique rts for long - term correlated data .",
    "connections between the long - term correlation exponent  @xmath40 and the rts have to be established independently in every class of long - term correlated dynamical systems , as was done for hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space  @xcite and fractal renewal point processes  @xcite .",
    "we argue in sec .  [",
    "ssec.numerical ] that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite described above are valid for long - term correlated _ linear _ time series  @xcite . in this paper we propose a closed expression for the rts of time series of this class , which is valid for recurrence intervals of both types  ( [ eq.q ] ) and  ( [ eq.xc ] ) .",
    "the mean recurrence time @xmath41 is a direct result of the choice of the recurrence interval . in area preserving dynamical systems kac s lemma  @xcite states that the inverse of @xmath42 is equal to the ergodic measure of the recurrence interval  @xmath43 . in the case of stationary time",

    "this measure is estimated as the fraction of valid events ( points inside the recurrence interval )  @xmath47 .",
    "intuitively , relation  ( [ eq.kac ] ) states simply that the total observation time  @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 besides the rts @xmath8 the pdf @xmath44 of the series of points itself is typically used to characterize the time series .",
    "contrary to other time series analyses ( as the detrended fluctuation analysis discussed below ) , the rts is independent of the pdf .",
    "in particular , it is irrelevant whether the second moment of the pdf is finite .",
    "a time series with a well behaved ( gaussian ) pdf can have either exponential or power - law rts   which will give the desirable rts if we choose  @xmath50 or  @xmath51 respectively . ] .",

    "the reason for this is simple : the rts depends on the sequence of the time series points and changes under their temporal rearrangement , which does not change the pdf of the data . while the rts is independent of the pdf of the series , the opposite happens to the mean recurrence time  @xmath42 .",
    "once the recurrence interval is defined , whether by relation  ( [ eq.q ] ) ,  ( [ eq.xc ] ) or by any other possible definition , the pdf  @xmath44 provides  @xmath54 through relation  ( [ eq.kac ] ) .    these two apparently trivial observations , i.e. , independence of the rts and dependence of @xmath42 on the pdf , shed new light on previous results .",
    "in what follows , we exemplify these points in the analysis of recurrence times between earthquakes , already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ ssec.soc ] . despite ( or because of )",

    "( [ eq.q ] ) is usually considerably smaller than  @xmath62 and the influence of the unknown asymptotic of the pdf becomes negligible . ] .",
    "the mean recurrence time between earthquakes of a given magnitude  @xmath57 is obtained inserting the pdf given by  ( [ eq.gr ] ) in relation  ( [ eq.kac ] ) , and using the interval of the type  ( [ eq.xc ] ) with  @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",

    "so far , the relation between  @xmath42 and the pdf was used to show that the mean waiting time between earthquakes is directly related to the gutenberg - richter law , but has nothing to do with temporal correlations between earthquakes . on the other hand , the rts obtained from earthquakes records",
    "@xcite is an independent result that can be used as a test for the dynamical models of earthquakes .",
    "recently , it was suggested that in soc models the sequence of avalanches is uncorrelated  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a counterexample ) and should thus be discarded .",
    "the solution of this debate is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we note that , as a consequence of the unrelatedness of  @xmath44 and @xmath8 , shuffling data of whatever distribution randomly ( as was done for the time series of seismic activity in ref .",

    "all of the empirical data exhibiting long - term correlations mentioned before represent systems which involve a huge number of degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , there is a similarly huge arbitrariness in choosing a given observation function @xmath26 , and the natural question is what to expect when we change this observation function .",

    "a similar situation is observed in financial market data . while the fluctuation of prices are typically uncorrelated",
    "the volatility is long - term correlated  @xcite .",
    "this gives already a clue that correlations measured on a given time series do in fact characterize the fluctuations of the given observable but do not characterize the underlying system in a more abstract way .",
    "here we want to study the dependence of correlations and rts on the chosen observable in more detail by comparing the properties of different observables .",
    "generally , both observables  @xmath82 and  @xmath105 are functions of the @xmath106dimensional phase space vectors  @xmath107 , and no simple function connecting @xmath82 and @xmath105 exists .",
    "since we are starting from time series data without underlying multi - dimensional phase space , we will restrict the analysis to a subclass of changes of observables , where in fact @xmath105 is given by a nonlinear ( potentially non - invertible ) function of @xmath82 .",
    "hence , we construct time series of different observables  @xmath105 as functions of the original long - term correlated time series of the variable  @xmath82 . having in mind a recurrence interval defined through  ( @xmath108 ) by relation  ( [ eq.xc ] ) , consider the following reversible transformation @xmath109 which is essentially the inverse of the original series  @xmath30 . if the @xmath82-series is gaussian distributed as considered previously , the pdf of the new series  @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 which is illustrated in fig .",

    "is also obtained using the transformed intervals in the @xmath105-series , the rts remains invariant under simultaneous transformation of variables and recurrence intervals .",
    "therefore , the previous observation that the change of the recurrence interval in the @xmath82-series does not affect the functional form of the stretched exponential distribution  ( [ eq.stretched ] ) , but does affect the exponent @xmath0 , carries over to transformations of the form  ( [ eq.y ] ) .",
    "for instance , the rts of a series obtained from transformation  ( [ eq.y ] ) applied to a time series  @xmath82 with  @xmath115 , is well described by the stretched exponential distribution  ( [ eq.stretched ] ) with ( see fig .",

    "[ sec.ii ] , to the series of recurrence times @xmath130 itself  @xcite . in this case",
    "this means that the pdf , which is the rts of the original time series , is independent of its correlation and shows that the results  _ ( ii ) _ and  _ ( iii ) _ stated in sec .",
    "[ ssec.bunde ] are independent .",

    "well established regimes of decay of the rts are exponentials and power - laws , and , only recently observed , stretched exponentials . we have obtained a closed expression for the stretched exponential distribution of recurrence times uniquely defined by the exponent  @xmath0 . as limits @xmath75 and @xmath133 , respectively , we recover the exponential and the power - law decay from these ( with the restriction that the power is fixed to 3/2 ) , suggesting that stretched exponentials describe recurrences in systems that have neither exponential nor power - law rts but that lie in between these two cases .",
    "we have verified numerically that the stretched exponential distribution is in good agreement with the numerical results obtained for long - term correlated linear time series , similarly to what was done in ref .",

    "( [ eq.y ] ) ) on the original long - term correlated linear time series  @xmath30 , we have shown that the stretched exponential distribution characterizes also the rts of extreme events in time series that are not long - term correlated .",
    "the presence and absence of long - term correlations in the series of the original observable  @xmath82 and of the transformed observable  @xmath105 , respectively , is similar to the one reported above for climatic records ( temperature and precipitation ) and stock - market indexes ( volatility and fluctuation of price ) .",
    "it is remarkable that this interesting behavior is obtained already through the simplest possible approach , i.e. , two different observables that depend directly and exclusively on each other .",
    "these considerations emphasize that the temporal characterization of the system through the autocorrelation or rts depend crucially on the chosen observable . by analyzing both the dependence of the exponent  @xmath0 of the stretched exponential distribution with the center of the recurrence interval ( relation  ( [ eq.limits ] ) ) and the multi - fractal spectrum of the @xmath105-series ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mf.gammas ] ) we conclude that , in long - term correlated linear time series , the correlations are concentrated in the extreme events .",
    "many interesting questions arise if one supposes that the measurements in a given experiment lead to the time series of the observable  @xmath105 , introduced in sec .",

    "the @xmath105-series has a complex multi - fractal spectrum ( fig .",
