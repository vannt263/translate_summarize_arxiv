    "the existence of gravitationally bound pairs of star clusters is important for the understanding of formation and evolution of star clusters .",
    "since the probability of tidal capture of one cluster by another one is very small ( bhatia et al . 1991 ) , we can assume that the components of a true binary star cluster have a common origin .",
    "star clusters form in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( e.g. elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ) , but the details of cluster formation are not yet well understood . if the components of a cluster pair or multiple cluster formed simultaneously or sequentially in the same fragmenting gmc they should have similar properties like age , metallicity and stellar content .    in the milky way only a few binary clusters are known , though lyng & wramdemark ( 1984 ) suggest the common origin of a group of six galactic open clusters .",
    "later pavloskaya & filippova ( 1989 ) , and more recently subramaniam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , propose the existence of more possible galactic binary clusters and cluster complexes",
    ".    the apparent lack of binary clusters in our own galaxy may be explained in different ways .",
    "subramaniam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) argue that since we are looking at the galaxy from inside , double clusters may be harder to detect than in the distant magellanic clouds , where binary clusters can easily be detected due to the closeness of their projected positions on the sky .",
    "the distance to the galactic clusters must also be taken into account , but only approximately 400 of 1400 open clusters have known distances ( lyng  1987 ) .",
    "subramaniam et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found 16 galactic binary cluster candidates on the base of the lyng catalogue , which corresponds to 8 % of the investigated number of clusters . from this",
    "they conclude that binary clusters in the milky way may not be uncommon .",
    "the evolution of a gravitationally bound pair of star clusters depends on the interaction between the components as well as on the tidal forces of the parent galaxy .",
    "if the tidal field is strong , the binary system will not survive for long but soon will get disrupted . from some preliminary considerations",
    "innanen et al .",
    "( 1972 ) conclude that due to stronger tidal forces in the milky way a binary cluster will execute only a fraction of a single orbit around the barycentre before its components are detached , but it will survive for several orbits in the less dense , less massive magellanic clouds . surdin ( 1991 ) came to the same conclusion , especially for massive clusters .",
    "the investigation of binary clusters may help to evaluate the tidal field of the parent galaxy .",
    "fujimoto & kumai ( 1997 ) suggest that globular and populous star clusters form through strong collisions between massive gas clouds in high - velocity random motion .",
    "shear and momentum of oblique cloud - cloud collisions lead to break - up into compressed sub - clouds revolving around each other , which may form binary or multiple clusters .",
    "binary star clusters are expected to form more easily in galaxies like the magellanic clouds with high - velocity random gas motions , whereas in the milky way such large - scale high - velocity random motions are lacking .",
    "bhatia & hatzidimitriou ( 1988 ) , hatzidimitriou & bhatia ( 1990 ) , and bhatia et al . (",
    "1991 ) , have surveyed the magellanic clouds in order to catalogue the binary cluster candidates .",
    "the maximum projected centre - to - centre separation of the components of a pair was chosen to be 18 pc , which corresponds to @xmath4 in the lmc .",
    "a binary cluster with larger separation may become detached by the external tidal forces while shorter separations may lead to mergers ( sugimoto & makino 1989 , and bhatia 1990 ) . in these studies",
    "69 pairs in the lmc and 9 pairs in the smc were identified .",
    "two clusters may appear to be a binary cluster due to chance line - up while in fact being at different distances within the magellanic clouds and not gravitationally bound to each other .",
    "the number of chance - pairs of objects uniformly distributed in space can be estimated with a formula presented by page ( 1975 ) . taking into account also a non - uniform distribution of star clusters ( at least for the lmc ) , bhatia & hatzidimitriou ( 1988 ) and hatzidimitriou & bhatia ( 1990 ) found that statistically 31 pairs in the lmc and 3 pairs in the smc could be explained due to mere chance line - up .",
    "as considerably more pairs have been found , this strongly suggests that at least a certain amount of them must be true binary clusters .",
    "while it is difficult to measure true distances between apparent binary clusters an analysis of their age and stellar content can give clues to a possible common origin .",
    "the star cluster pair ngc2006 ( also known as sl537 ) and sl538 is located in the northwestern part of the ob association lh77 in supergiant shell lmc4 , and has a projected centre - to - centre separation of @xmath5 corresponding to 13.3 pc .",
    "this double cluster has already been the subject of investigations concerning its binarity .",
    "bhatia ( 1992 ) and bica et al . (",
    "1996 ) found from integrated photometry that both clusters have the same age .",
    "kontizas et al .",
    "( 1993 ) analyzed the stellar content and the cores of the components using low resolution objective prism spectra and integrated iue spectra .",
    "they suggested this cluster pair constitutes a true binary cluster , which moreover may merge in some @xmath6 years .",
    "this raises another question , which has also been discussed in bhatia & macgillivray ( 1988 ) : could mergers of former binary star clusters be responsible for at least some of the blue populous clusters in the lmc ?",
    "we investigated the double cluster ngc2006 and sl538 in an attempt to find further affirmation  or disaffirmation  of the binarity of the two clusters .",
    "we analyze the star density in the clusters and the surrounding field ( section 3 ) . for the first time we derive ages for these clusters from isochrone",
    "fits to colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ( section 4 ) , which is a much more reliable age determination than using integrated photometry . in section 5 we investigate the content of be stars in the clusters as well as in the surrounding field .",
    "in section 6 we give a summary and conclusions .",
    "an image of sl538 and ngc2006 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sl538 ] . to the south - east of the cluster pair a third star cluster",
    "is located : kmhk1019 .",
    "the data have been obtained on 15 december 1992 with efosc 2 at the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope at la silla .",
    "a @xmath7 coated thomson thx31156 chip ( eso # 19 ) was used with a pixel scale of @xmath8 resulting in a field of view of @xmath9 .",
    "all data were obtained with the standard bessell @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , gunn @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters used at the 2.2 m telescope ( see table [ obs ] for an observing log ) .",
    "after standard image reduction with midas , profile fitting photometry was carried out with daophot  ii ( stetson 1991 ) running under midas .",
    "the photometry was transformed using the landolt standard fields around pg0218 + 029 , rubin149 , and sa98 ( landolt 1992 ) observed in the same night .",
    "we applied the following transformation relations :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mean airmass during observation , capital letters represent standard magnitudes and colours , and lower - case letters denote instrumental magnitudes after normalizing to an exposure time of 1 sec .",
    "the resulting colour terms @xmath17 , zero points @xmath18 and atmospheric extinction coefficients @xmath19 are :    @xmath20    .[obs]observing log [ cols=\"<,^,>,^ \" , ]     the errors are corresponding to @xmath21 gaussian errors and are calculated using the confidence limits for small number statistics from gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "the components of the double cluster show the same fraction of be stars , and the sixfold amount found in the surrounding field .",
    "the difference between the ratios @xmath22 of sl538 and the field is @xmath23 which is more than a @xmath21-effect .",
    "the difference between sl538 and kmhk1019 is @xmath24 which is less than a @xmath25-effect according to the upper confidence limit for kmhk1019 .",
    "thus , the be star content of kmhk1019 may be comparable to the cluster pair .",
    "investigating the stellar density around the clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ sl538dens ] , right ) we see no signs of increased star density reaching from kmhk1019 towards the cluster pair , but we see an enhanced star density between sl538 and ngc2006 .",
    "this may indicate a stellar bridge and thus gravitational interaction between sl538 and ngc2006 .",
    "the stars in the bridge are main sequence stars and thus they may either belong to the cluster  system  or to the young field star populations",
    ". however , artificial star experiments showed that a stellar bridge may also be explained ( 24% probability for a  small  but only 6% probability for a more pronounced bridge ) by statistical fluctuations in the field star density .",
    "fitting geneva isochrones ( schaerer et al . 1993 ) to the cmds we find the following ages : sl538 : @xmath1 myr , ngc2006 : @xmath2 myr , kmhk1019 : 16 myr , youngest field : 16 myr . the three clusters might have formed sequentially as part of the same gmc that formed lh77 .",
    "be stars are concentrated in sl538 and ngc2006 , and both clusters show the same ratio of @xmath22 .",
    "this is in agreement with kontizas et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who investigated integrated iue spectra and the distribution of spectral types of stars and found that both clusters have similar stellar content . since be stars are usually rapid rotators this may indicate intrinsically higher rotational velocities in the components of the cluster pair .",
    "the amount of be stars detected in the surrounding field is considerably lower .",
    "an investigation of the imf of the binary cluster candidate showed that the imf slopes agree with each other within the errors and are compatible with the salpeter value ( @xmath26 , salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "our results for the imf slopes are @xmath27 for sl538 and @xmath28 for ngc2006 . with these values",
    "we estimate the upper limits for the total cluster masses to be @xmath29 ( sl538 ) and @xmath30 ( ngc2006 ) .",
    "the similarity of the cluster masses is in agreement with the findings from kontizas et al .",
    "let us assume that the cluster pair indeed is a binary system : following kepler s third law and assuming @xmath31 for the total mass of the binary system and 13.3 pc for the distance between the clusters we get an orbit period of @xmath32 myr .",
    "this would mean that the clusters so far have moved less than half of an orbit since their formation .",
    "the similarity of properties ( ages , be star content , slope of the imf and masses ) indicates possible joint formation and suggests small spatial separation .",
    "our results suggest that sl538 and ngc2006 are a true binary cluster , but a final proof is still missing . radial velocity measurements would help to understand the kinematics of the clusters and may prove or disprove its possible binary nature , but such data are not yet available . if the stellar bridge is real this may imply that the merger process has begun .",
    "however , our artificial star experiments showed that we can not state whether this bridge is real or not .",
