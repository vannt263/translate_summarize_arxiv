    "the primary goal of heavy - ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl and large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is to establish the existence of a transient phase consisting of quarks , anti - quarks and gluons known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "since such a phase lasts for a few @xmath5 , it is impossible to observe it directly .",
    "thus , various indirect probes have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic probes is one of them .",
    "the advantage of such probe is that once these are produced they can escape the interaction zone without much distortion in their energy and momentum .",
    "they , thus carry the information of the collision dynamics very effectively .",
    "photons and dileptons are produced throughout the evaluation process of the collisions . in the low and intermediate mass region ,",
    "lepton pair are produced from the @xmath6 process ( thermal ) and from various hadronic reactions and decay . in the high mass region , there is the contribution from drell - yan process , which can be calculated from pqcd .",
    "another important contribution in this invariant mass region is the jet - dilepton conversion in the qgp .",
    "several authors  @xcite have estimated this contribution where a jet quark ( anti - quark ) interact with a thermal anti - quark ( quark ) to produce a large mass lepton pair .",
    "it is to be noted that before annihilation of a @xmath7 jet with a thermal @xmath8 , the @xmath7 jet may lose energy .",
    "such possibility has also been considered in refs  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in all those calculation that the magnitude of this mechanism is order of magnitude larger than the thermal processes and is of the same order of the drell - yan processes  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that in all those calculations an isotropic plasma has been assumed to be formed .",
    "but the most difficult problem lies in the determination of isotropization and thermalization time scales ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) of the qgp .",
    "studies on elliptic flow ( upto about @xmath11 gev ) using ideal hydrodynamics indicate that the matter produced in such collisions becomes isotropic with @xmath12 fm / c  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "perturbative estimates yield much slower thermalization of qgp  @xcite .",
    "however , recent hydrodynamical studies  @xcite have shown that due to the poor knowledge of the initial conditions , there is a sizable amount of uncertainty in the estimation of thermalization or isotropization time .",
    "the other uncertain parameters are the transition temperature @xmath13 , the spatial profile , and the effects of flow .",
    "thus it is necessary to find suitable probes which are sensitive to these parameters . as mentioned earlier electromagnetic probes",
    "have long been considered to be one of the most promising tools to characterize the initial state of the collisions  @xcite .",
    "dileptons ( photon as well ) can be one such observables . in the early stages of heavy ion collisions , due to the rapid longitudinal expansion",
    "the plasma after formation in isotropic phase , may become anisotropic  @xcite . as a result",
    "the momentum distribution of the plasma particles become anisotropic in momentum space . the author in ref  @xcite",
    "have calculated the `` medium '' dilepton yield for various isotropization times and compared it with drell - yan and jet - thermal processes .",
    "it is shown that the effect of the anisotropy can not be neglected while calculating @xmath14 distribution and @xmath15 distribution .",
    "in fact in certain kinematic region this contribution is comparable to drell - yan as well as jet - thermal process .",
    "jet - photon conversion in the aqgp has been calculated in ref  @xcite with @xmath1 up to @xmath16 gev to extract the isotropization time . also in intermediate and low @xmath1 the photon transverse momentum distribution has been calculated to infer about the isotropization time scale  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the extracted values of @xmath9 from the above two cases are consistent . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the contribution of the jet - dilepton conversion in aqgp has not been done so far .",
    "it is , thus , our purpose to estimate the dilepton yield from jet - plasma interaction in the present work . to keep the things simple in this work",
    ", we shall not include the energy loss of the jet in the aqgp .",
    "it should be noted that in absence of any precise knowledge about the dynamics at early time of the collision , one can introduce phenomenological models to describe the evolution of the pre - equilibrium phase . in this work",
    ", we will use one such model , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the time dependence of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath17 , and hard momentum scale , @xmath18 .",
    "this model introduces four parameters to parameterize the ignorance of pre - equilibrium dynamics : the parton formation time ( @xmath19 ) , the isotropization time ( @xmath9 ) , which is the time when the system starts to undergo ideal hydrodynamical expansion and @xmath20 sets the sharpness of the transition to hydrodynamical behavior . the fourth parameter @xmath21 is introduced to characterize the nature of pre - equilibrium anisotropy i.e. whether the pre - equilibrium phase is non - interacting or collisionally broadened .",
    "the plane of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we describe the formalism of jet - conversion dilepton production in aqgp .",
    "jet - production and drell - yan process will be discussed in section iii .",
    "we present a brief discussion on space - time evolution of aqgp in section iv .",
    "section v will be devoted to present the results .",
    "finally , we summarize in section vi .",
    "according to the relativistic kinetic theory , the dilepton production rate at leading order in the coupling @xmath22 , is given by  @xcite : = f_q/|q(*p*_1)f_jet(*p*_2)v_12^l^+l^-_q|q ^(4)(p - p_1-p_2)[dirate ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the phase space distribution of the jet quarks / anti - quarks and medium quarks / anti - quarks respectively .",
