    "<S> we consider the general discrete memoryless two - way relay channel , where two users exchange messages via a relay , and propose two functional - decode - forward coding strategies for this channel . </S>",
    "<S> functional - decode - forward involves the relay decoding a function of the users messages rather than the individual messages themselves . </S>",
    "<S> this function is then broadcast back to the users , which can be used in conjunction with the user s own message to decode the other user s message . via a numerical example </S>",
    "<S> , we show that functional - decode - forward with linear codes is capable of achieving strictly larger sum rates than those achievable by other strategies . </S>"
