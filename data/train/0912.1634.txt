    "for polymer translocation through narrow pores in membranes , the scaling behavior of pore - blockade times with the length of linear polymers has been a topic of intense research in recent times .",
    "such interest in polymer translocation has been fueled by its obvious biological context ; i.e. , molecular transport through cell membranes , which is an essential mechanism in living organisms . often , the molecules are too long , and the pores in the membranes too narrow , to allow the molecules to pass through as a single collapsed unit . in such circumstances ,",
    "the molecules have to deform themselves in order to squeeze  i.e. , translocate  through the pores .",
    "parallely , the urge to understand the dynamics of translocation also stems from the fact that new developments in design and fabrication of nanometer - sized pores and etching methods , in recent times , have put translocation at the forefront of single - molecule experiments , with the hope that translocation may lead to cheaper and faster technology for the analysis of biomolecules .    although significant progress has been made in the last few years in the field of both theory and simulations of polymer translocation , consensus among different research groups on the scaling behavior of the characteristic time @xmath8 that the polymer spends in the pore , with the length @xmath0 of a linear polymer , characterized by an exponent @xmath9 , has generally remained elusive .",
    "of the three main translocation situations studied theoretically or by computer simulations , namely ( i ) unbiased translocation , wherein the polymer translocates purely due to thermal fluctuations , ( ii ) field - driven translocation , wherein translocation is driven by a potential difference across the pore , and ( iii ) pulled translocation , wherein translocation is facilitated by a pulling force at the head of the polymer , unbiased translocation is by far the most fiercely debated topic .    from a statistical physics perspective",
    ", the translocation problem can be seen as a kind of a tunneling process over an entropic barrier .",
    "this entropic barrier arises because the number of states available to the polymer is significantly decreased by the presence of the membrane . for a polymer of length @xmath0 ,",
    "the number of states in the bulk scales as @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is a universal exponent  @xmath12 and @xmath13 in two and three dimensions , respectively  while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not universal .",
    "the corresponding number of states for the same polymer , but whose end is tethered to the membrane , is approximated by @xmath16 in which the parameter @xmath15 is not affected by the introduction of the membrane , @xmath17 is a different universal exponent  @xmath18 and @xmath19 in two and three dimensions , respectively  while @xmath20 is again not universal .",
    "consider the translocating polymer , for which there are @xmath21 monomers on one side and @xmath22 monomers on the other .",
    "since this situation can be seen as two strands of polymers with one end ( of each strand ) tethered on the membrane , the number of states for this polymer is given by @xmath23 , which attains a minimum when @xmath24 . the effective entropic barrier faced by a translocating polymer is thus @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in 2001 ,",
    "chuang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite established that the then existing mean - field type descriptions based on the fokker - planck equation for first - passage over this entropic barrier @xcite are unsuitable for describing unbiased translocation . in the absence of explicit hydrodynamics , i.e. , for a rouse polymer , chuang _",
    "_ @xcite argued that the pore - blockade time ( or the dwell time ) @xmath8 can not be less than the the rouse time , which scales as @xmath28 .",
    "based on simulations in 2d using the bfm , with @xmath29 or less , they further concluded that the ratio of the dwell and rouse times is approximately constant , suggesting that @xmath2 as well . as it later turned out , the paper by chuang _",
    "_ initiated a flurry of theoretical and simulation works on unbiased translocation .",

    "in refs . @xcite we presented the theory of translocation , based on the polymer s memory effects .",
    "we now demonstrate that once these finite - size effects are taken into account , the polymer s memory effects for the bfm are consistent with that theory .    the theory we presented in refs .",
    "@xcite is as follows .",
    "translocation takes place via the exchange of monomers through the pore .",
    "this exchange responds to @xmath30 , the difference in chain tension perpendicular to the membrane ; simultaneously , @xmath30 adjusts to @xmath31 , the transport velocity of monomers across the pore , as well . in the presence of memory effects , @xmath30 and @xmath32",
    "are related to each other by @xmath33 via the memory kernel @xmath34 .",
    "this relation can be inverted to obtain @xmath35 .",
    "the uniqueness of the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath32 implies that in the laplace transform language , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the laplace variable representing inverse time . additionally , via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are expressed as @xmath40            in refs .",
    "@xcite we showed that the polymer s memory kernel is given by @xmath41 , in which @xmath42 is the rouse time ; this result , together with eq .",
    "( [ eqnew ] ) yields @xmath43 .",
    "the derivation for the exponent @xmath44 of the power - law relies on three scaling relations for an equilibrated polymer of length @xmath21 with one end tethered to a membrane : ( i ) the real - space distance between the free and the tethered end scales as @xmath45 , ( ii ) its entropic spring constant scales as @xmath46 , and ( iii ) its longest correlation time scales as @xmath47 . for",
    "the bfm , ( i ) holds for @xmath21 not so large , but since the scalings ( ii ) and ( iii ) suffer from severe finite - size effects ( as reported in secs .",
    "[ sec3a ] and [ sec3b ] ) , we expect the @xmath48 behavior of the power - law in @xmath34 to only manifest itself at long times",
    ". note that `` long times '' here refers to times long compared to unity , but short in comparison to the longest relaxation time of the polymer ; this implies that @xmath49 can only be observed when the polymer is long .",
    "indeed , we demonstrate this below in fig .",
    "[ fignew1 ] , by measuring @xmath50 for the bfm for a polymer with length @xmath51 , where we used the perpendicular - to - the - membrane distance @xmath52 of the center - of - mass of the first four monomers ( counting from the pore ) as a proxy for the chain tension @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we tether the middle monomer of the polymer in the pore ( this corresponds to @xmath53 ) , and obtain good statistics for @xmath54 over a total simulation time of @xmath55 attempted moves per monomer . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fignew1](a ) , @xmath56 does not show a memory exponent @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , given that we expect a behavior @xmath58 @xcite for the bfm in 2d , fig .",
    "[ fignew1](b ) shows that @xmath34 can be fitted with a combination of power - laws @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( see figure caption for details ) .",
    "the fact that the data can be fitted with this combination of power - laws does not constitute compelling evidence for @xmath61 ; other exponents within a range of @xmath62 can be fitted as well , with suitably chosen power - law corrections .",
    "the main point is , however , that our theoretically expected behavior @xmath61 can not be ruled out from these numerical data .",
    "so far we have discussed the finite - size effects in several basic equilibrium quantities for the bfm , and that the polymer s memory effects in the bfm do not rule out our theory of translocation that originally yielded @xmath43 by relating the polymer s anomalous dynamics to its memory kernel ; yet the asymptotic scaling behavior of @xmath8 with @xmath0 for the bfm is unknown at present .",
    "( it is the severity of the finite - size effects that makes scaling conclusions in relation to unbiased translocation for @xmath63 particularly meaningless ) .",
    "the answer to this conundrum lies in the dynamical peculiarity of the bfm , in particular how the bfm behaves dynamically ( i.e. , when @xmath64 ) to the introduction of an obstacle , which , in the case at hand is the membrane with a narrow pore . to this end , we sample many polymer states ( drawn from the equilibrium distribution ) , in which the polymer is tethered halfway through the pore with a width of two lattice spacings . for each of these states , for each monomer , we determine the individual monomeric mobilities . since the orientation of the membrane breaks rotational symmetry ,",
    "we separately keep track of the moves parallel and perpendicular to the membrane .",
    "the mobility of a monomer , parallel or perpendicular to the membrane , is defined by the acceptance probability of the corresponding mc move .     as a function of the monomer number .",
    "the polymer is tethered halfway through the pore , i.e. , monomer number 50 is tethered in the pore .",
    "the mobility of each monomer is separately presented in terms of the moves parallel ( blue ) or perpendicular ( black ) to the membrane.[fig4 ] ]    the individual monomeric mobilities for the bfm are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for @xmath65 ( with the 50th monomer tethered in the pore ) . on the one hand",
    ", the monomer located in the pore shows no mobility in the direction parallel to the membrane ; this is to be expected , since sideways mobility of this monomer is forbidden due to the steric hindrance of the membrane .",
    "however , immediately outside the pore , the mobility of the monomers parallel to the membrane is strongly enhanced before it settles to a value @xmath66 further away from the pore . on the other hand , the perpendicular - to - the - membrane mobilities of the threaded monomer and a few ( two or three ) of its",
    "nearest monomers are strongly hindered .",
    "such anomalous behavior of the near - the - pore mobilities arises in the bfm since the presence of the membrane results in the stretching of the polymer around the pore , introducing an enhanced likelihood of maximally stretched bonds , which reduce the perpendicular - to - the - membrane mobilities of the threaded monomer and a few of its nearest monomers .",
    "the tendency of frozen mobility perpendicular to the membrane is peculiar for the specific types of moves allowed in the bfm ( we have also checked that this continues to hold for longer polymers in the bfm , data not shown here ) .",
    "for instance , we verified that if a collective move of two neighboring monomers in the same direction is added to the dynamics , this tendency of frozen mobility is removed to a large extent .",
    "note that in other models , as well as in experiment , reduced mobility ( `` friction '' ) in the pore can have various natural causes ; although this can postpone the onset of scaling , it is not expected to change scaling exponents in the thermodynamic ( long - chain ) limit .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention here that in our lattice polymer model , in the neighborhood of the pore , the monomeric mobilities parallel to the membrane are reduced , while the perpendicular - to - the - membrane mobilities are marginally enhanced ( not shown here ) .    from a theoretical point of view , in the limit of long polymers , either enhanced or reduced dynamics in the near vicinity of the pore",
    " especially if there are only two or three monomers around the pore that suffer from anomalous mobility problems ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] )  should not change scaling exponents .",
    "however , such a statement is clearly not true for the bfm , as we demonstrate below that by enhancing the monomeric mobilities within a radius of 5 lattice sites around the pore ( roughly twice the average bond length ) , one can significantly change the apparent exponent @xmath67 , towards our predicted theoretical value @xmath68 .",
    "it is indeed remarkable that enhancing the mobilities of typically two or three monomers around the pore changes the apparent exponent @xmath67 significantly for the bfm , even for fairly long polymers .      to investigate how much the anomalous mobility of the monomers around the pore in the bfm influences the dynamics of translocation",
    ", we perform simulations of the bfm in which all moves within a radius of 5 lattice sites around the pore are boosted by a ( more or less arbitrary ) factor 4 . more precisely ,",
    "all moves for all monomers located within a distance of 5 lattice sites from the pore , either before or after the move , are attempted four times more often than the other moves .",
    "note that this does not violate detailed balance : for every move that is oversampled , the reverse move is also oversampled . the choice for these values in this modified bfm are both motivated by the data of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; i.e. , ( i ) in the original bfm model , typically only two or three monomers around the monomer that resides in the pore at any time suffer from reduced mobility and ( ii ) the factor of 4 is certainly enough to overcome even the reduced mobility of the monomer in the pore in the perpendicular - to - the - membrane direction , which for @xmath65 is approximately a factor 2.5 smaller than that of the monomer far away from the pore , and increases only slightly with polymer length .",
    "the unit of time in this modified model is still defined by one attempted mc moves per monomer far away from the membrane .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the anomalous dynamics of translocation  analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  in this modified bfm : as can be seen therein , the apparent exponent @xmath67 has significantly decreased ( from @xmath69 in fig . [ fig3 ] to @xmath70 in fig . [ fig5 ] ) , towards the theoretical prediction @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding apparent exponent @xmath71 up to @xmath72 ( data not shown ) , larger than @xmath73 , but smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "additionally , for this modified bfm , we confirm that the memory kernel @xmath50 exhibits @xmath48 behaviour as well .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fignew2 ] for a polymer with length @xmath51 , where we also compare the data of fig .",
    "[ fignew1 ] . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fignew2 ] , the onset of the @xmath75 takes place at @xmath76 for both models .     for a polymer with length @xmath51 for the bfm and the modified bfm .",
    "the data for the models are averaged over @xmath77 and @xmath78 independent realizations , over simulation times of @xmath79 and @xmath80 attempted moves per monomer per realization for the bfm and modified bfm , respectively .",
    "[ fignew2 ] ]    note that the modification we made for mobilities of the monomers in the modified bfm is by no means what we can claim to be an exact compensation for the around - the - pore anomalous monomeric mobilities in the bfm , as seen in fig .",
    "rather , the introduction of this modified model should be seen as an attempt to understand whether such anomalous mobilities can account for the deviations from the expected values of @xmath7 , namely @xmath74 , albeit the polymer s memory effects in the bfm confirm our theory of translocation that originally yielded @xmath43 by relating the polymer s anomalous dynamics to its memory kernel .",
    "the remarkable fact that for the bfm , enhancing the mobilities of typically two monomers around the pore changes the apparent exponent @xmath67 , even for fairly long polymers , combined with the fact that the memory kernel equals @xmath81 at long times , leads us to conclude that the anomalous mobilities of the monomers around the pore  peculiarities of the bfm  are indeed responsible for the deviations from our expected value of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath82 . we thus conclude that the bfm is _ not _ a convenient model for cases where the polymer is constrained to pass through a narrow pore .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we study unbiased polymer translocation in two - dimensions , with the bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) , in the absence of external forces on the polymer ( i.e. , unbiased translocation ) and hydrodynamical interactions ( i.e. , the polymer is a rouse polymer ) . while it has long been established that the pore - blockade time @xmath8 , the characteristic time the polymer spends in the pore , asymptotically scales with the polymer length as @xmath83 for some @xmath7 , earlier studies of unbiased polymer translocation , using the bfm , concluded that @xmath2 , whereas a variety of other models produce results consistent with @xmath84 , originally predicted by us . here",
    "@xmath4 is the flory exponent of the polymer ; @xmath5 in 2d .",
    "we find that for the bfm the quantity @xmath85 is a monotonically decreasing quantity with increasing @xmath0 , such that the rate of decrease for @xmath86 increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "having noted that with the bfm , the conclusion that @xmath2 has been based on simulation data for @xmath63 , we further show in this paper that ( i ) the bfm suffers from strong finite - size effects for @xmath63 , and that ( ii ) @xmath86 decreases steeply for @xmath87 , the conclusion that @xmath2  in the usual sense of critical phenomena for polymers in the limit @xmath88  is meaningless .",
    "we trace the peculiarities of the bfm to the anomalously low mobility of two or three monomers in the near vicinity of the pore , in the direction perpendicular to the membrane .",
    "we find that if the mobility of these monomers is enhanced , the exponent for the pore - blockade time increases towards @xmath82 .",
    "we conclude that , although the bfm is a fine model for polymer dynamics in general , it is not in situations where the polymer is constrained to pass through a narrow pore .",
    "our analysis also implies that for those polymer models that assert @xmath2 , one needs to thoroughly investigate their finite - size effects and dynamical peculiarities , if such an assertion is to be proved meaningful .",
    "a related issue regarding the use of the bfm for translocating polymers does still remain , and that is the case of field - driven translocation in two dimensions .",
    "for this situation , translocation is driven by a potential difference across the pore .",
    "( all results quoted below are for rouse polymers . )",
    "first of all , using the same memory effects as in unbiased translocation , in ref .",
    "@xcite we argued that in 3d , the pore - blockade time exponent is @xmath89 , and corroborated this result with extensive simulations ; this result has now been verified with completely different polymer models @xcite .",
    "further , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argued that for field - driven translocation in 2d , because of energy conservation , the pore - blockade time exponent has a lower bound @xmath90 : for any field strength , a polymer length exists above which the rouse friction prevents the transport of monomers from keeping up with the speed of translocation dictated by the memory effects .",
    "the exponent @xmath91 is therefore not observed for field - driven translocation in 2d .",
    "we also showed , numerically , using our lattice polymer model that in 2d the pore - blockade time exponent indeed turns out to be the same as its lower bound @xmath92 @xcite , which is in agreement with those obtained by the use of the bfm by two separate research groups @xcite , who used @xmath0 up to @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "however , a third group which also used the bfm claimed the pore - blockade time exponent for field - driven translocation in 2d to be consistent with @xmath92 for @xmath0 up to @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 @xcite , which is clearly at odds with the results of refs .",
    "if indeed the bfm finds the pore - blockade time exponent to be @xmath96 , then the anomalous mobilities of the monomers around the pore , together with the finite - size effects , may explain why the exponent @xmath90 is not observed in the bfm for field - driven translocation in two dimensions .",
    "since chain tension is not a directly measurable observable in the bfm , we considered the perpendicular - to - the - membrane distance @xmath98 of the center - of - mass of the first @xmath99 monomers as a proxy for the chain tension [ see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , where we used @xmath100 . to verify that the local extension is indeed proportional to the chain tension at the pore , we performed separate simulations ( not reported ) , in which we pulled on the free end of a tethered chain with a known ( small ) force @xmath101 , and recorded @xmath102 .",
    "it turned out that for @xmath103 or 2 , @xmath104 shows slightly non - linear behavior as a function of @xmath101 for small forces , while for @xmath105 or higher , @xmath104 is linear in @xmath101 for small and medium - strength forces ."
