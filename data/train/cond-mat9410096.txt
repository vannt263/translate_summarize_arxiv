    "<S> +    it is an important object to disclose the structure of the phase diagram of models with strong electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , one has to have a clear picture which phases are likely to be realised and second , for these phases it must be possible to calculate the free energy . in case of the hubbard model for example </S>",
    "<S> both problems can hardly be surmounted . </S>",
    "<S> even if one restricts oneself to a small number of phases and to the dynamic mean field theory resulting from the limit of high dimensions @xcite , the problem still requires massive computational effort ( e.g.  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different for the model of interacting spinless fermions @xcite on an infinite dimensional hypercubic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> although the diagrammatic theory is simple , the physics is far from trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the spinless fermion model in second quantisation is @xmath2 scaling with the inverse dimension @xmath3 is performed to ensure the continuity of the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite .    in a previous work </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the homogeneous phase was investigated in the limit @xmath4 @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> limit hartree- and random phase approximation become exact @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides the occurrence of an ab - charge density wave ( cdw ) characterised by the wave vector @xmath5 it was found that the density - density susceptibility @xmath6 diverges at incommensurate values of the wave vector @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the inverse bare susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> commensurate values of @xmath7 which belong to a value of @xmath11 are of measure zero . </S>",
    "<S> the complete stability analysis is possible in @xmath12 because @xmath13 depends on @xmath7 only via @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is sufficient to examine @xmath14 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of @xmath14 indicates a second order transition from the homogeneous phase at high doping and/or low interaction into an incommensurate cdw . the structure of the new incommensurate phase has not yet been investigated . in finite dimensions and for related models such as </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard model and the @xmath15-@xmath16 model there exist many works which treat different variational or approximative approaches to incommensurate phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the perturbation theory of the model ( 1 ) becomes exactly tractable in @xmath4 it is the natural candidate to examine the energetic effects of different spatial structures of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations are self - consistent and include infinitely many parameters in the thermodynamic limit so that no systematic approach to their solution exists @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we give results for the following ansatz for the spatial structure of the order parameter @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average particle density : @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the index @xmath20 counts the directions ; @xmath21 is the @xmath20th component of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the overall amplitude and the new defined functions @xmath24 take the values @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> . the product form of this ansatz allows to profit best from the simplifications of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> yet it is still very general since it allows any sequence of @xmath26 and @xmath27 independently for the @xmath28 directions without assuming translational invariance .    a close inspection of the free energy shows that it depends on @xmath29 only via the amplitude @xmath23 and the relative frequency @xmath30 that @xmath29 has the same sign on adjacent sites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are the only parameters which are relevant for the influence of the spatial structure on the energy . in order to find an explicit functional for the energy we exploit the freedom in choosing the @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath31 we set @xmath32 and for @xmath33 we set @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is special since the order parameter can be characterised by the wave vector @xmath35 but does not restrict the freedom contained in the ansatz for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a general relationship @xmath36 , although only for special realisations @xmath8 can be defined . </S>",
    "<S> the easy structure of the cdw with wave vector @xmath37 helps to resum the perturbation series for the grand canonical potential since the green function is a @xmath38 matrix in @xmath39-space .    in infinite dimensions </S>",
    "<S> the diagram for the free energy is simple . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the free fermion system the grand potential gains a term @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the green function and @xmath42 the self - energy . at @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> this yields the ground state energy @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the doping @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 and the equations which define the energetic minimum are @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> for a particular value of the interaction @xmath51 it is possible to determine for each doping the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath8 which describe the physical state . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , one has to be on the watch for first order phase transitions .    as example we look at the case @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we plotted ground state energy as function of doping in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> for large doping and at half - filling the situation is clear . for the former </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the homogeneous phase whereas for the latter the system is in the commensurate cdw characterised by @xmath54 ( ab - phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> inbetween four special points at @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 can be identified .    </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the situation with fixed @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the system is forced to choose between the homogeneous phase and the ab - phase . </S>",
    "<S> the response of the system towards fluctuations with wave vector @xmath59 becomes infinite at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy in indicated by a dotted and a dotted - dashed curve , respectively in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> for smaller doping the ground state energy is concave so that a first order phase transition will occur . </S>",
    "<S> the maxwell construction gives rise to the value @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is phase separation between the homogeneous phase and the ab phase for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this situation turns out to be generic for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> inbetween  and thus for the case @xmath53  a different scenario is realised .    </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of @xmath14 is at @xmath58 for general values of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath63 holds @xmath64 . by minimizing @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the solid curve in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the curve is concave for low dopings so that a maxwell construction must be made . </S>",
    "<S> the doping where the phase separation sets in is @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realise that @xmath66 . for dopings @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> the pure incommensurate phase is the absolute energy minimum .    </S>",
    "<S> the overall result is depicted in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> at half - filling the system is in the ab - phase for all @xmath68 . for large doping </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the homogeneous phase . for @xmath69 and @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> there is phase separation between the ab - phase and a hole - enriched homogeneous phase . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath63 there exists a region where an incommensurate phase is present , and a region of phase separation between the ab - phase and the hole - enriched incommensurate phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath8 is close to @xmath27 in the incommensurate phase . to give an impression we plotted those values of @xmath8 in fig .  3 which arise at the borders of the incommensurate phase in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath71 at constant @xmath51 is monotonic so that the figure gives a good impression of the deviation of @xmath8 from @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the values for @xmath8 belonging to the left border ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , given by the solid curve in fig .  3 , are important for the whole region of phase separation .    in summary , we demonstrated the complexity of the ground state phase diagram of the model of interacting spinless fermions in infinite dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> most important is the existence of an incommensurate phase and of the phase separation between the ab - phase and the incommensurate or homogeneous phase .    </S>",
