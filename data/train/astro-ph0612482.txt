    "the launching of jets from young stars is one of the most enigmatic and intriguing phenomena in astrophysics .",
    "one fundamental problem to which jets are believed to provide a solution is the removal of angular momentum from the central accreting system , which is required to permit low angular momentum material to fall onto the star .",
    "recent optical observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that atomic jets from evolved t - tauri stars may indeed transport angular momentum away from the inner regions of the accretion disk .",
    "is the same mechanism at the origin of the molecular jet counterparts observed when the protostar is still deeply embedded in its natal high - density core ? to address this question , we have investigate hh212 in orion ( @xmath8 = 460 pc ) , a highly symmetric bipolar h@xmath2 jet @xcite , associated with a collimated co outflow @xcite , and driven by a low - luminosity class 0 protostar , iras054130104 .",
    "hh212 provides an optimal situation in which to study jet kinematics , since it lies close to the plane of the sky ( 4@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows hints of rotation in one h@xmath2 knot @xcite , and is surrounded by a compact ammonia core rotating about an axis aligned with the jet @xcite . as a tracer",
    ", we used sio , which is associated with shocks and generally suffers minimal contamination from infalling envelopes or swept - up cavities @xcite .",
    "the sio observations of hh212 were obtained in january - march 2006 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) in france .",
    "two 6-element configurations were used : the new extended a configuration , which includes baselines from 136  m up to 760  m , and the new b configuration , with baselines from 88  m to 452  m. the dual - channel receivers and the correlator were tuned to simultaneously observe the sio @xmath9 = 21 line at 86.847 ghz ( resolution : @xmath3 0.13 km s@xmath7 ; bandwidth : @xmath3 70 km s@xmath7 ) and the @xmath9 = 54 line at 217.105 ghz ( 0.11 and 55 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "continuum emission at both frequencies was also measured .",
    "amplitude and phase were calibrated by observing 0528 + 134 and 0605@xmath10085 .",
    "the weather conditions were excellent ( phase noise rms of 30@xmath11 at 86  ghz on the 760  m baselines ) , leading to a radio seeing of 0@xmath135 .",
    "the flux density scale was derived by observing 3c84 and 3c279 , with an uncertainty of @xmath3 25% .",
    "images were produced using natural weighting , and restored with clean beams of @xmath12 ( pa=22@xmath11 ) at 3.5 mm , and of @xmath13 ( pa=21@xmath11 ) at 1.4 mm , using the gildas software .",
    "the high degree of elongation of the beam is due to the zero declination of the source .",
    "however , the spatial resolution is highest perpendicular to the jet direction , making the present observations ideal for the study of the jet collimation and kinematics .",
    "a new , deeper , and higher spatial resolution nir image of hh212 was obtained using isaac on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) , paranal , chile on november  12 , 2005 under good conditions .",
    "although the knots have proper motions of 100200 km s@xmath7 @xcite , the small epoch difference to the sio data ensures that the knots have moved only @xmath3 0@xmath1025 , thus facilitating an comparison between the two data sets .",
    "a series of images were taken through a 1% wide filter centred on the v=10 s(1 ) line of h@xmath2 at 2.122@xmath14 m . with a total integration time of 32 minutes per pixel after mosaicing .",
    "the image scale was 0@xmath1147 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "and the spatial resolution is 0@xmath135 fwhm , similar to our sio(54 ) map .",
    "accurate astrometry ( 0@xmath114 rms ) was derived via 21 stars in common with the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the images have not been continuum - subtracted and thus stellar sources are visible . however , the hh212 jet itself consists almost exclusively of shocked h@xmath2 line emission and thus there is no confusion along the jet axis .",
    "emission maps of sio @xmath9 = 21 and 54 are shown in fig .",
    "1a - b , superimposed onto the nearly contemporaneous h@xmath2 image .",
    "the sio emission is confined to a highly collimated bipolar jet , located along the main outflow axis .",
    "the red- and blue - shifted lobes consist of two symmetric pairs of bullets : an outer pair ( blue 1 and red 1 ) that follows the h@xmath2 intensity distribution beyond 10@xmath15 from the driving source , and a new inner pair within @xmath16 of the source ( blue 2 and red 2 ) , with no h@xmath2 counterpart .",
    "figure  1c shows the inner 5@xmath15 of the 1.4 mm continuum map , with the sio(54 ) emission superimposed .      the 1.4 mm continuum map ( fig .",
    "1c ) shows a bright source ( hereafter called mm1 ) at position @xmath17= 05@xmath18 43@xmath19 51@xmath2041 , @xmath21= 01@xmath5 02@xmath22 53@xmath1160 , in excellent agreement with the vla position at 3.5 cm reported by @xcite . comparison with the sio(54 ) map clearly indicates that mm1 is the driving source of the molecular jet .",
    "in addition , we have a tentative detection at s / n @xmath23 6 ( @xmath3 4 mjy ) of a secondary peak ( hereafter mm2 ) at @xmath24=+1@xmath16 , @xmath25=0@xmath15 , which could trace an embedded companion .",
    "only mm1 is bright enough to be detected at 3.5 mm , with a flux of 6 mjy .",
    "gaussian fitting in the uv plane at 1.4 mm shows that mm1 is associated with an unresolved peak ( @xmath26 0@xmath126 ) with a faint extension towards se . the integrated flux at 1.4 mm is 33 mjy , significantly lower than the 110 mjy reported by @xcite in a 2@xmath15 beam , indicating that most of the envelope emission has been resolved out by the pdbi .",
    "contamination by free - free emission from the jet is negligible : if we extrapolate the flux measured by the vla at 3.5 cm @xcite with a typical @xmath27 slope , the expected contribution is only 0.16 mjy at 3.5 mm .",
    "hence we are dominated by dust continuum .",
    "the 1.4 mm flux corresponds to a mean surface brightness of 3.4  k in our beam .",
    "since envelopes and disks are not elongated along the jet axis , the source size is less than 0@xmath126 @xmath28 0@xmath126 and thus the true brightness temperature is quite high : @xmath29 13  k. the spectral slope between 1.4 mm and 3.5 mm , derived from uv data , is @xmath3 2 .",
    "both facts seem to indicate that dust emission is close to optically thick at 1.4 mm .",
    "this would suggest that the unresolved mm peak is not tracing the inner parts of the envelope , but a circumstellar disk viewed close to edge - on",
    ". the disk diameter would be @xmath26 0@xmath126 = 117  au .",
    "our high resolution maps reveal a small - scale pair of sio emission knots emerging from mm1 and extending out to 1@xmath152@xmath15 = 5001000 au ( fig .",
    "no h@xmath2 counterpart is visible , as the whole structure lies entirely in the high extinction region around the source .",
    "the beam - deconvolved transversal size of the two lobes ( blue 2/red 2 ) is @xmath3 0@xmath135 , and are thus much more collimated than the hourglass - shaped bipolar cavity seen in @xmath30co on similar scales by @xcite .",
    "position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams along the jet axis ( fig .",
    "2 ) further show that the sio emission extends to high velocities of @xmath3110 km s@xmath7 from the ambient velocity ( + 1.6 km s@xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , compared to only @xmath31 1.7 km s@xmath7 for @xmath30co @xcite . hence the sio lobes include a narrower and faster jet - like component distinct from the swept - up cavity .",
    "the maximum radial velocity is similar to the typical centroid velocity of h@xmath2 knots further out ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , arguing that the high - velocity sio is probably tracing the base of the large - scale ( @xmath3 0.5 pc ) molecular jet .",
    "correction for inclination ( 4@xmath5 to the plane of the sky ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives a full jet speed @xmath3 140 km s@xmath7 , comparable to the proper motion of h@xmath2 knots @xcite .",
    "inner sio knots were also recently imaged in hh211 down to @xmath32 from the protostar @xcite .",
    "hence sio appears to be a powerful tracer of the jet base in class 0 sources .",
    "@xcite found broad sio linewidths in the protostar in hh211 , which they attributed to a wide angle wind .",
    "such an interpretation is not supported in hh212 , however : sio profiles show little blue / red overlap in each lobe ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , despite the almost edge - on inclination . assuming a conical wind of constant speed , a half - opening angle @xmath26 6  is inferred , ruling out a wide - angle wind . the fact that sio emission stops _",
    "precisely _ near zero velocity , with an overlap of at most 2 km s@xmath7 , would actually suggest that the wind half - opening angle coincides to within 2  with the angle from the plane of the sky , is related to the angle to the plane of the sky , @xmath33 , by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ratio ( in algebraic value ) of maximum to minimum radial velocities in a given lobe . in hh212 , @xmath36 km s@xmath7 , @xmath37 km s@xmath7 , and @xmath33=4  yield @xmath38 and @xmath39 = 4 - 6 . ] .",
    "since such a coincidence is statistically unlikely , it appears more probable that high - velocity sio is confined to _ less _ than @xmath40  from the jet axis ( thus producing no emission at zero velocity ) and that sio emission near systemic velocity is tracing _ intrinsically slower _ , possibly less collimated material .",
    "this slow material may trace unresolved bowshock wings .",
    "indeed , water maser spots observed via vlbi reveal curved bowshocks at @xmath31 0@xmath11 from the protostar , covering a range of radial velocities ( black arrows in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the restrictive excitation and coherence conditions for maser amplification , the observed velocity range is less than the full range in the bow .",
    "hence , internal bowshocks could contribute significantly to the broad sio line widths .",
    "intrinsic gradients in jet speed ( due e.g. to time variability , or to a range of launch radii ) may also be present .      at distances of 10@xmath15 and beyond",
    ", the spatial correspondence between sio and h@xmath2 is very good",
    ". the two symmetric elongated sio bullets ( blue 1/red 1 ) peak towards h@xmath2 knots sk2-sk4 and nk2-nk4 ( note that the sio(54 ) image is affected by primary beam attenuation at large distances from the centre ( fwhm = 22@xmath15 ) .",
    "sio emission is also seen between and beyond these knots , with a morphology similar to that in h@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "the correspondence between sio and h@xmath2 in the outer bullets is also excellent in radial velocity , as shown in the pv diagram in fig . 2 ( left panel ) .",
    "the sio(2 - 1 ) profiles peak within 2 km s@xmath7 of the h@xmath2 centroid .",
    "hence sio appears to trace the same jet as h@xmath2 , confirming the conclusion of @xcite based on sio(87 ) profiles at much lower angular resolution ( 22@xmath15 ) .",
    "the sio line profiles are broader than towards the inner knots , but they show the same extension down to zero velocity and small degree of red / blue overlap , suggestive of internal bowshocks .",
    "line profile asymmetries between the two lobes indicate slight differences in shock structure despite the highly symmetric knot spacings .",
    "in contrast to the excellent agreement between sio and h@xmath2 beyond 10@xmath15 , we find a striking lack of sio emission towards the brightest h@xmath2 knots ( sk1 , nk1 ) . a similar effect was observed towards the hh211 jet , where the brightest",
    ", bow - shaped h@xmath2 knots also lack an sio counterpart @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation would be that sk1 and nk1 trace more powerful shocks where sio does not form / survive or where the sio excitation is extremely high and consequently the low - j transitions are very weak . the detection of [ fe  ii ] emission in sk1 and nk1 @xcite , their clear bow - shock geometry ( see fig .  1 ) , and their 3 - 4 times broader linewidth compared to other h@xmath2 knots in hh212 ( fig .",
    "2 ) support this hypothesis .",
    "estimates of sio excitation and abundances will be presented in a separate forthcoming paper .",
    "@xcite reported a centroid velocity shift of + 2.3 km s@xmath7 from nw to se across knot sk1 which they attributed to jet rotation , based on its agreement with the rotation sense of the ammonia protostellar core @xcite .",
    "although sk1 is not detected in sio ( see 3.3 ) , we can test this interpretation in the other knots , as rotation speeds should remain roughly constant once the jet has achieved cylindrical collimation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "figure  3a presents pv diagrams across the jet in sio(5 - 4 ) for each emitting region .",
    "no shift of the intensity peak is seen across blue 1 on the scales @xmath31 0@xmath15 investigated by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a clear gradient is observed across the red 1 bullet ( fig .",
    "3 , bottom panel ) , with a shift of 6 km s@xmath7 over @xmath3 1@xmath15 from nw to se .",
    "however , the gradient goes in opposite sense to the rotation pattern of the nh@xmath41 core , ruling out that we are observing rotation of a centrifugally - driven mhd jet .",
    "the fact that the centroid of red 1 is slightly displaced from the jet axis , i.e. that outer sio bullets are slightly misaligned with respect to the inner sio jet , suggests that this effect is due instead to a kinematical asymmetry in the shocked material , possibly related to the h@xmath2 jet wiggling apparent in fig .",
    "3b . since sk1 traces a much wider bowshock than the sk2-sk4 knots in red 1 ( see fig .  1 ) , its transverse gradient measured in h@xmath2 could easily be affected by similar asymmetries , and should be interpreted with great caution .",
    "the innermost sio knots ( blue 2/red 2 ) do not show signs of transverse velocity shifts above 1 km s@xmath7 , consistent with the high - velocity sio jet being practically unresolved transversally .",
    "higher angular resolution would be needed to constrain the level of jet rotation .",
