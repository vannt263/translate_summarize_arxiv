    "the gauge transformation of the free theory takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gauge parameter .",
    "the action of the free theory which is invariant under this gauge transformation is written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an appropriate inner product for a pair of string fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in the interacting theory ,",
    "this gauge transformation is nonlinearly extended by introducing products of string fields .",

    "furthermore , the quantization of the theory based on the batalin - vilkovisky formalism  @xcite is straightforward when the action has this @xmath0 structure .",
    "the cubic theory based on the star product is a special case where the @xmath0 relations are satisfied without @xmath17-string products for @xmath22 because of the associativity of the star product , and we can think of @xmath0 as the structure underlying gauge invariance for open string field theory .",
    "actually , the @xmath0 structure is closely related to the integration over the moduli space of disks with punctures on the boundary .",
    "we can construct a set of string products satisfying the @xmath0 relations for the open bosonic string based on the decomposition of the moduli space of disks with punctures on the boundary .",
    "for closed string field theory , the corresponding structure is called @xmath23  @xcite , and gauge - invariant actions with the @xmath23 structure for the closed bosonic string can be constructed based on the decomposition of the moduli space of spheres with punctures .",
    "we could therefore say that the integration of the moduli space of disks or spheres with punctures is encoded through the @xmath0 structure or the @xmath23 structure , respectively , in bosonic string field theory .",
    "in superstring field theory , the structure underlying the gauge invariance should be related to the decomposition of the supermoduli space of super - riemann surfaces , but the understanding in this perspective has not been fully developed .",
    "while we are seeing exciting breakthroughs in the construction of superstring field theory over the last few years , we consider that it is important to explore the relation of the gauge invariance to the supermoduli space for further developments .",
    "below let us describe the current status of the relation to the supermoduli space from three aspects .",
    "first , consider the berkovits formulation of open superstring field theory in the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) sector  @xcite based on the large hilbert space of the superconformal ghost sector  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most successful formulations of superstring field theory , and the action is beautifully written in a wess - zumino - witten - like ( wzw - like ) form .",
    "however , the relation to the supermoduli space is obscure because the gauge invariance is based on the large hilbert space .",
    "the quantization of this theory based on the batalin - vilkovisky formalism has turned out to be formidably complicated  @xcite , and this might be coming from our insufficient understanding of the relation to the supermoduli space . in  @xcite ,",
    "the four - point amplitude in the berkovits formulation was calculated in a class of gauges where the relation to the world - sheet calculation can be manifestly seen .",
    "it was found that the assignment of picture - changing operators is different in the @xmath24 channel and in the @xmath25 channel of feynman diagrams with two vertices and one propagator , and this different behavior is adjusted by the contribution from the quartic interaction . in other words , we found that the quartic interaction of the berkovits formulation precisely implements the _ vertical integration _  @xcite .",
    "this different behavior persists in the limit where the picture - changing operator localizes at the open - string midpoint .",
    "this way the difficulty in the attempt of formulating the cubic theory with a local insertion of a picture - changing operator at the open - string midpoint can be understood in the context of the covering of the supermoduli space of super - riemann surfaces . to summarize ,",
    "we have obtained preliminary insight into the understanding of why the berkovits formulation based on the large hilbert space is successful from the context of the supermoduli space of super - riemann surfaces , and we consider that it is important to explore this direction further .",
    "second , consider formulating the ns sector of open superstring filed theory based on the small hilbert space .",
    "it had long been thought that a regular formulation based on the small hilbert space would be difficult because of singularities coming from local picture - changing operators .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in  @xcite that a regular formulation of open superstring field theory based on the small hilbert space can be obtained from the berkovits formulation by partial gauge fixing . in the process of the partial gauge fixing",
    ", a line integral of the superconformal ghost @xmath26 of  @xcite in the large hilbert space is used .",
    "its brst transformation yields a line integral of the picture - changing operator , and insertions of local picture - changing operators are avoided in this approach . while a line integral of @xmath26 does not have simple transformation properties under conformal transformations , the partial gauge fixing guarantees that the resulting theory is gauge invariant .",
    "it turned out , however , that the resulting theory does not exhibit an @xmath0 structure .",
    "once we recognize that a line integral of @xmath26 can be used in constructing a gauge - invariant action , we do not have to start from the berkovits formulation . using a line integral of @xmath26 as a new ingredient ,",
    "an action with an @xmath0 structure based on the small hilbert space was constructed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the equivalence of the theory with an @xmath0 structure for the open superstring in  @xcite to the berkovits formulation is shown  @xcite .",
    "we can now extract an @xmath0 structure hidden in the berkovits formulation by field redefinition . while our understanding of the ns sector of open superstring field theory has significantly developed , the relation to the supermoduli space has not be seen explicitly .",
    "this is partly because the large hilbert space is used in a fairly essential way during the construction of the theory with an @xmath0 structure in  @xcite , although the dynamical string field is in the small hilbert space .",
    "third , consider the ramond sector of open superstring field theory . while construction of an action including the ramond sector had been a major obstacle to formulating superstring field theory for many years , gauge - invariant actions for open superstring field theory including both the ns sector and the ramond sector were recently constructed  @xcite .",
    "sen also developed a remarkable approach to covariant actions including ramond sectors by allowing spurious free fields  @xcite .",
    "while sen described the approach in the context of heterotic string field theory and type ii superstring field theory , the idea can be applied to open superstring field theory , and in that case we can explicitly construct interactions based on the star product as explained in subsection  3.5 of  @xcite .",
    "the action in  @xcite is based on the wzw - like formulation .",
    "the interactions are written in a closed form to all orders , but the action does not exhibit an @xmath0 structure . the action in  @xcite is based on the approach developed in  @xcite .",
    "it has a cyclic @xmath0 structure , but the form of the interactions is complicated and is not written in a closed form .",
    "the equivalence of the two actions is also shown in  @xcite . in the construction of these actions",
    ", there were two key ingredients .",
    "the first ingredient is to impose a constraint on the state space of the ramond sector and to characterize the constraint using a projector which is obtained by integrating an odd modulus of propagator strips in the ramond sector  @xcite .",
    "this characterization was technically convenient , but it was conceptually important as well and the treatment of the ramond sector in the construction of one - particle irreducible effective superstring field theory  @xcite indicated that interactions can be compatible with the constraint characterized this way .",
    "the second ingredient is an analog in the ramond sector of the line integral of @xmath26 used in the ns sector .",
    "therefore , understanding the relation to the supermoduli space of super - riemann surfaces has indeed played a crucial role in this breakthrough regarding the ramond sector , but it is a hybrid between the ingredient based on the supermoduli space and the ingredient based on the large hilbert space . we expect to acquire more fundamental formulations when we understand the relation between the supermoduli space and the large hilbert space",
    ".    since all the formulations described above use the large hilbert space to some extent , the first step to improve our understanding on the relation of gauge invariance to the supermoduli space would be to construct superstring field theory directly based on the supermoduli space without using the large hilbert space at all . in this paper , we present a new approach to formulating open superstring field theory based on the covering of the supermoduli space of super - riemann surfaces .",
    "system developed in  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the covering of the supermoduli space should not be understood as the covering of integration regions in ordinary integrals .",
    "one way to describe the covering of the supermoduli space is to use a partition of unity .",
    "see section  7 of  @xcite for details .",
    "we will also develop related discussions in subsection  [ sec : supermoduli ] .",
    "] we explicitly construct a gauge - invariant action in the ns sector up to quartic interactions .",
    "the cubic interaction takes a form of an integral over an odd modulus of disks with three punctures and the associated ghost is inserted .",
    "the quartic interaction takes a form of an integral over one even modulus and two odd moduli , and it can be interpreted as the integral over the region of the supermoduli space of disks with four punctures which is not covered by feynman diagrams with two cubic vertices and one propagator . as our approach",
    "is based on the covering of the supermoduli space , the resulting theory naturally realizes an @xmath0 structure , and the two - string product and the three - string product used in defining the cubic and quartic interactions are constructed to satisfy the @xmath0 relations to this order .",
