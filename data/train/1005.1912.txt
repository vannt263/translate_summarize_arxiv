    "in general , open clusters ( ocs ) are formed and evolve in - or close to - the galactic disk . as a consequence of their orbits",
    ", they are constantly suffering tidal stress from galactic substructures and undergoing different degrees of mass loss that , in most cases , might lead to cluster dissolution .",
    "indeed , the vast majority of the ocs do not survive even the embedded phase ( e.g. @xcite ) , and few reach ages older than @xmath9yr ( e.g. @xcite ) .    as systems in which the balance between velocity dispersion and escape velocity plays a vital role , oc stellar distributions change continually as a function of time because of mass segregation and evaporation , tidal interactions with the disk and/or bulge , encounters with giant molecular clouds , as well as mass loss associated with stellar evolution . on average , these processes tend to accelerate the cluster dynamical evolution and change the internal structure in varying degrees . indeed , near the solar circle , theoretical and observational evidence ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) suggest a mass dependent disruption time scale of a few @xmath10yr . as a consequence , most ocs end up completely dissolved in the galactic stellar field ( e.g. @xcite ) or leave only poorly - populated remnants ( @xcite and references therein ) , long before reaching @xmath11gyr of age .    reflecting the above age / dissolution effect , only @xmath12 of the @xmath13 ocs with known age listed in webda are older than 1gyr , while @xmath14 have an age between 100myr and 1gyr , and @xmath15 are younger than 100myr .",
    "so , besides the obvious importance of deriving reliable astrophysical parameters for as yet unstudied clusters , the unambiguous characterisation of ocs older than several @xmath10yr will increase the statistics of objects undergoing the dissolution phase .",
    "this , in turn , can be used for better determining the time scale for cluster dissolution in the galaxy .",
    "cluster databases such as webda still contain many unstudied objects that , over the years , have been identified as star cluster candidates , usually based on the appearance in optical images .",
    "not surprisingly , close investigations of some of these overlooked objects have uncovered a number of actual ocs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "besides , since young ocs are relatively easy to identify ( because of the presence of bright stars ) even at relatively large distances , the overlooked clusters , in general , are as old as several @xmath10yr , sometimes reaching a few gyr ( e.g. the @xmath16gyr old oc berkeley56 - @xcite ) .",
    "based on the optical _ catalogue of star clusters and associations _ of @xcite , webda lists the coordinates of 171 oc candidates originally found by j. ruprecht ( classified as ruprecht clusters ; hereafter ru ) .",
    "however , only 79 have been so far confirmed as ocs , having determinations of fundamental parameters , such as the age , reddening , and distance from the sun . in the present paper",

    "to preserve spatial resolution along the full radial range and , at the same time keeping moderate error bars , the rdps are built in rings of increasing width with distance from the cluster centre .",
    "the set of ring widths used is @xmath151 , respectively for @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 . obviously ,",
    "for any magnitude range , field stars with the same colour as the cluster s will not be excluded by the above filtering process .",
    "this gives rise to a residual background level , which can be measured as the average number density of stars away from the cluster .",
    "the @xmath157 coordinate ( and uncertainty ) of each ring corresponds to the average position ( and standard deviation ) of the stars inside the ring .",
    "the resulting rdps ( and residual background ) are shown in fig .",
    "note that ru152 is located at @xmath158 to the northwest of ngc2477 , which causes a conspicuous bump in the rdp .",
    "we also estimate the cluster radius ( ) by measuring the distance from the centre where the cluster rdp and residual background are statistically indistinguishable . in this sense ,  can be considered as an observational truncation radius , whose value depends both on the radial distribution of member stars and the field density .",
    "the above rdps are fitted with the function @xmath159 , where @xmath17 and @xmath160 are the central and residual background stellar densities , and  is the core radius . when applied to star counts",
    ", this function is similar to that used by @xcite to the surface - brightness profiles in the central parts of globular clusters .",
    "degrees of freedom are minimised by allowing only @xmath17 and  to vary in the fits , while @xmath160 is previously measured in the surrounding field and kept fixed .",
    "the best - fit solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , and the corresponding structural parameters are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "within uncertainties , the adopted king - like function provides a reasonable description along the full radial range of the rdps for most of the sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the exceptions are ru27 , ru41 , and ru174 , which present a pronounced cusp ( density excess over the king - like fit ) in the innermost rdp bin .",
    "the same appears to apply to ru23 and ru63 , although only at the @xmath161 level .",
    "this feature has been attributed to a post - core collapse structure in some globular clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a dynamical evolution - related feature has also been detected in the rdp of some gyr - old ocs , e.g. ngc3960 ( @xcite ) and lk10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , clusters that form dynamically cool and with significant substructure will probably develop an irregular central region , unless such a region collapses and smooths - out the initial substructure ( @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the distribution of core radii derived for a sample of relatively nearby ocs by @xcite - their fig .  3",
    ", the present clusters occupy the small-   tail .",
    "however , we find significant differences , especially in , for the 3 clusters in common with @xcite . while they find angular values of  about twice those we derive , their angular values of  are @xmath162 ( ru27 ) and @xmath163 ( ru1 and ru26 ) times larger .",
    "this , in turn , would imply core radii of the order of @xmath164pc to @xmath165pc , bigger than most of the galactic globular clusters ( see , e.g. fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ) .",
    "these discrepancies probably arise from the fact that they do not field - decontaminate their photometry . because of the low - contrast rdps that result when",
    "field stars are not eliminated , structural radii derived from rdp fits may not be robust .    finally , according to @xcite , the depth - limited 2mass photometry has only a small effect on the core radius determination ( by means of the king - like fit ) , but may be somewhat more important for , especially in ru37 , for which stars fainter than the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) are not detected .",
    "in the previous sections we derived a set of fundamental and structural parameters for a sample of 15 overlooked ruprecht clusters .",
    "now we use these parameters for comparison with the previously analysed ruprecht clusters listed in webda , as well as to investigate relations among parameters .",
    "webda contains 171 such clusters with coordinates , but only 79 have age , reddening and distance from the sun been determined so far .",
    "the @xmath166 and @xmath167 distribution of the ruprecht clusters in webda is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . by far , most of them are located in the @xmath168 and @xmath169 quadrants , and within @xmath170 .",
    "our sample shares the same @xmath167 distribution but is restricted essentially to the @xmath168 quadrant . with respect to the age and",
    "reddening distributions , our sample basically maps those of the webda clusters . however , our sample is biased towards larger values of the distance from the sun , which is consistent with the fact that they still havent been studied in detail .",
    "the positions of the sample clusters , projected onto the galactic plane , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , which contains the spiral arm structure of the milky way based on @xcite and @xcite , derived from hii regions and molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic bar is shown with an orientation of 14and 6kpc of total length ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for comparison we also include the ocs with age and distance from the sun given in webda , separated in two age groups , clusters younger or older than 1gyr .",
    "the main features that emerge from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] are summarised as follows .",
    "with respect to the sun , all directions show a depletion in the number of detected ocs for distances farther than @xmath171kpc .",
    "this occurs because completeness effects ( due to crowding and high background levels ) together with enhanced disruption rates begin to affect critically regions more distant than @xmath171kpc , especially towards the bulge ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the high dissolution rates in the inner galaxy associated with dynamical interactions with the disk , the tidal pull of the bulge , and collisions with giant molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , old ocs are found preferentially outside the solar circle , a region with relatively low tidal stress . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of bright stars in young ocs allows them to be detected farther than the old ones , especially towards the central galaxy .",
    "it should be noted that webda contains essentially optically - selected ocs , and when surveys in the near - infrared are conducted - like the present one , an increasing number of ( basically old ) ocs at large distances from the sun are being found .",
    "near - infrared searches , in turn , might minimise the oc incompleteness around the sun , but the problem for large distances would still remain ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of the present sample is located between the perseus and sagittarius - carina arms , except for ru37 and especially ru152 that are beyond the perseus arm . given their age range ( @xmath172 ) , it is quite possible that some of them may have suffered tidal stress from the arms , by means of encounters with giant molecular clouds .",
    "collision with such clouds is another potential dissolution mechanism , especially for low - mass clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such events might have accelerated the dynamical evolution and produced changes in the cluster structure .",
    "however , we note that there is no difference in the projected positions of the clusters that display the central cusp in the rdp ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) with respect to the king - like ones . in any case",
    ", it would be necessary to re - construct their orbits through the galaxy for a deeper analysis on this issue .",
    "despite the considerable scatter , a first - order dependence of cluster size on galactocentric distance is suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( panel a ) .",
    "incidentally , the discordant cluster is ru37 ( @xmath173pc ) , the oldest one ( @xmath0gyr ) of our sample .",
    "given the age and distance from the sun ( @xmath174kpc ) of ru37 , stars fainter than the msto are not detected by 2mass , which may have underestimated its size . such a relation has already been observed ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and may reflect the low dissolution rates associated with large galactocentric distances . the rather weak correlation may be partly due to the fact that our sample clusters are located essentially outside the solar circle .",
    "this point can be further investigated by examining the dependence of cluster size on the vertical distance to the galactic plane @xmath3 , since our clusters are located within @xmath175kpc . with the exception of ru37",
    ", a somewhat tight correlation shows up between  and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , excluding ru37 , the remaining points are roughly described by the relation @xmath176 .",
    "again , this relation is consistent with a lower - frequency of encounters with giant molecular clouds and the disk for ocs at high @xmath3 with respect to those orbiting closer to the plane .",
    "however , we note that part of this effect may be related to completeness .",
    "given that the average background@xmath177foreground contamination decreases with increasing @xmath3 , the external parts of an oc ( where the surface brightness is intrinsically low ) can be detected at larger distances for high-@xmath3 objects than for those near the plane ( @xcite ) . on average , clusters at high-@xmath3 will tend to seem bigger than near the plane .      having decontaminated the photometry ( sect .",
    "[ 2mass ] ) and derived structural parameters ( sect .",
    "[ struc ] ) , we now proceed to compute the integrated ( apparent and absolute ) magnitudes and reddening - corrected colours for the 2mass bands . since the decontamination efficiency is lower than 100% ( sect .",
    "[ 2mass ] ) , we start by applying the colour - magnitude filter to the decontaminated photometry",
    ". then we sum the flux ( for a given band ) of all stars within @xmath150 ( table  [ tab2 ] ) to compute the cluster@xmath177residual field  stars flux ( @xmath178 ) . the same is done for all the comparison field stars , to estimate the residual contamination flux ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "thus , the integrated magnitude is given by @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the ratio between the projected areas of the cluster and the comparison field .",
    "this procedure is applied to the , , and  bands , and should minimise decontamination efficiency effects .    since all clusters contain giant and msto stars ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] - [ fig5 ] ) - which by far dominate the luminosity , the integrated magnitudes should not be significantly affected by the non - detection of the lower - ms stars associated with the depth - limited 2mass photometry . reddening and distance from the sun ( for the absolute magnitude and reddening - corrected colours ) are those computed in sect .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab3 ] and discussed below .",
    "the integrated and reddening - corrected @xmath20  and @xmath19  colours are tightly related by @xmath182 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , panel c ) , and redder clusters also tend to be brighter in  ( e ) .",
    "panels ( d ) and ( f ) seem to show a slight tendency of old clusters to be redder and brighter than the young ones .",
    "this is consistent with most of the stellar luminosity ( especially for the more massive stars ) being transferred from the optical to the near - ir , as star clusters become older . as a caveat",
    ", the latter relation hinges essentially on a single cluster with @xmath0gyr of age .",
    "thus , with the present data we can not quantify the role of age in driving the near - infrared colours ( panels c and d ) , since the age for most of the present ocs are restricted to the range @xmath183 .",
    "as far as we are aware , there is no study of oc integrated colours or magnitudes linking the near - ir to the optical .",
    "however , if we assume that ocs and globular clusters follow similar scaling relations - at least with respect to integrated colours and magnitudes , we can use the galactic globular clusters ( mwgcs ) both for comparison and to search for such a link . for this purpose , we use the integrated and reddening - corrected @xmath184 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 colours computed for a large set of mwgcs on 2mass images ( @xcite ) , coupled to the respective absolute @xmath6 magnitudes from harris ( 1996 , together with the 2003 revision ) .",
    "the results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( top panels ) .",
    "consistent with their old ages , the mwgcs @xmath20 and @xmath19 colours ( panel a ) are restricted to a narrow range ( the spread is essentially due to the different metallicities and partly to unaccounted for reddening ) , when compared to the set of ( younger ) ruprecht ocs ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , panel c ) . besides",
    ", the near - ir mwgc colours follow a similar - although somewhat flatter ( @xmath185 ) - relation than our ruprecht ocs ( @xmath186 ) . finally , with respect to the absolute magnitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( panel b ) , the mwgcs",
    "are tightly related by @xmath187 , over the relatively wide ranges @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "note that the few discordant points can be accounted for by a reddening under - correction .",
    "the apparent  magnitude distribution of our sample clusters is clearly biased towards fainter objects ( panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) , with about half of the sample having @xmath190 , while the absolute  magnitude ( e ) is roughly uniformly distributed around @xmath191 , with a @xmath192mag spread .",
    "the observed ( d ) and reddening - corrected ( f )  colours are roughly distributed around the average value @xmath193 , with a @xmath194mag spread .",
    "now , extrapolating the mwgc @xmath195 relation to the @xmath7 values derived for our ruprecht clusters , we find @xmath6 values in the range @xmath8 ( panel g of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "note that the integrated colour @xmath196 is similar in all cases , with an average value @xmath197 .",
    "we now compare the ruprecht @xmath6 values with those measured for 140 galactic ocs ( mwocs ) by @xcite together with 106 ocs of @xcite distributions . for the ocs in common we have used the more recent values of @xcite . ] .",
    "most ( @xmath198 ) of the mwocs have @xmath6 within @xmath199 , but the remaining ones can be as luminous as @xmath200 . clearly , our ruprecht clusters , in general , appear to be intrinsically faint in the optical , with an @xmath6 distribution similar to - but still somewhat biased to lower luminosities than - the mwocs .",
    "given the rather efficient and numerous dissolution mechanisms operating in the galaxy , the majority of the open clusters do not survive beyond a few @xmath10yr . in this context , it is important to investigate the structural and photometric properties of ocs that are undergoing this evolved phase .",
    "the present paper focuses on 15 overlooked ruprecht clusters , 12 of them never before studied . with the exception of a single object at @xmath201 , the remaining clusters are located in the @xmath168 galactic quadrant , which minimises the field - star contamination .",
    "we work with 2mass photometry ( with errors @xmath202mag ) , on which we apply field - star decontamination to enhance cmd evolutionary sequences and stellar rdps , thus yielding more constrained fundamental and structural parameters .    as typical optically discovered clusters , the reddening values are relatively low , within @xmath203 ; on the other hand , they are distant from the sun , within @xmath1 .",
    "the integrated apparent  magnitudes are rather faint , within @xmath4 , but given the distances , the absolute magnitudes are relatively bright @xmath5 .",
    "the ages are in the range 400myr - 1gyr , except for the significantly older ru37 , with @xmath0gyr .",
    "the rdps are well contrasted with respect to the background and follow the king - like profile for most of the radial range .",
    "exceptions are ru23 , ru27 , ru41 , ru63 , and ru174 , which present a pronounced stellar density excess in the innermost rdp bin .",
    "the core radii of the present sample are small , when compared to those of nearby ocs ( e.g. @xcite ) . by extrapolating the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , derived for globular clusters , we estimate @xmath8 , which suggests that they are low - luminosity optically - selected clusters .",
    "the sample clusters are located between ( or close to ) the perseus and sagittarius - carina arms , and we present evidence that the cluster size increases both with galactocentric distance and distance to the plane .",
    "the latter relation , in particular , is consistent with a low frequency of tidal stress associated with high-@xmath3 regions .",
    "it is clear from the above analysis that searches for star clusters in catalogues of candidates - even in the optical - are far from complete .",
    "detailed investigations will certainly add more members to the present - day open cluster census .",
    "besides , since young clusters are rather easy to identify even at large distances , the overlooked clusters are expected to be of the evolved / old age range . thus , works like the present one are important not only because reliable astrophysical parameters are derived for a sample of unstudied clusters .",
    "perhaps the main importance lies in the unambiguous characterisation of open clusters with ages beyond several @xmath10yr .",
    "a better statistics on the population of these - and older - clusters can be used to investigate cluster formation rates and to constrain the time scale of cluster dissolution in the galaxy .",
