    "one of the unexpected results reported by phenix and star during the first year rhic run at @xmath10  gev was that in contrast to the strong @xmath11 quenching for @xmath12 , the corresponding charged hadrons were found to be suppressed by only a factor @xmath13 .",
    "even more surprisingly , the identified particle spectra analysis at phenix suggests that @xmath14 for @xmath15  gev .",
    "thus , baryon and antibaryon production may in fact dominate the moderate- to high-@xmath1 hadron flavor yields  @xcite .",
    "these and other data point to novel baryon transport dynamics playing role in nucleus - nucleus reactions . an important indicator of this is the high valence proton rapidity density at midrapidity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "more recent results corroborate the non - perturbative baryon production hypothesis through equally abundant @xmath17 and @xmath18 production  @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the mean transverse momentum @xmath19 for various baryon and antibaryon species is approximately constant and deviates from the common hydrodynamic flow systematics of soft hadron production in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "this provides strong motivation to explore alternative physical mechanisms that may give insight into the anomalous anti+baryon behavior at rhic .",
    "identified particle analyses from the recent @xmath20  gev rhic run find similar puzzling features of moderate-@xmath1 baryon spectra that have to be understood in the context of even stronger quenching of neutral pions  .",
    "a topological non - perturbative baryon production and transport mechanism was originally proposed by veneziano and rossi in elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been successfully generalized and implemented for the case of nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "its phenomenological applications are currently based on regge theory , where a regge trajectory @xmath21 is specified by its intercept @xmath22 and slope @xmath23 .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "regge theory gives exponential rapidity correlations , which in the presence of two sources ( at @xmath26 ) lead to net baryon rapidity density in central @xmath0 collisions of the form : @xmath27 it is evident from eq.([btrans ] ) that the net baryon distribution integrates to @xmath28 and in going to peripheral reactions scales as @xmath29 . at rhic energies of @xmath30  gev , corresponding to @xmath31 , in central reactions @xmath32 .",
    "the relative contribution of each baryon species can be evaluated from isospin symmetry and strangeness conservation ( via comparison to midrapidity kaon production ) .",
    "hadronic transport in small - to - moderate @xmath1 is effectively controlled by the slope of the regge trajectory .",
    "this would suggest that the baryon / meson mean inverse slopes in a phenomenological @xmath1-exponential ( @xmath33 ) soft particle production model are related as @xmath34 .",
    "soft pion production , however , is largely dominated by resonance decays , where the cumulative effect from the random walk in @xmath1 due to string braking is destroyed .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath35 ( 220  mev : 275 mev : 380 mev )  @xcite .",
    "one also notes that in the limit of pair production dominated by junction - antijunction loops ( which we consider here ) the transverse momentum distribution of antibaryons closely resembles that of baryons ( with @xmath36 ) .",
    "the high-@xmath1 part of the hadron spectra is computed from leading order pqcd augmented by the effects of initial multiple scattering ( cronin ) , nuclear shadowing , and parton energy loss .",
    "the most important modification to the perturbative scheme comes from the final state gluon bremsstrahlung computed here via the gyulassy - levai - vitev ( glv ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "its centrality dependence determines to a large extent ( especially for pions ) the centrality dependence of the baryon / meson ratios .",
    "similar technique has been used to estimate the @xmath37-induced initial parton broadening  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the interplay between a novel baryon production and transport mechanism  @xcite ( in rapidity @xmath38 and moderate @xmath1 ) and the suppression of particle spectra as a result of the medium induced non - abelian energy loss of jets  @xcite in @xmath8 reactions at @xmath10  gev .",
    "we find an enhanced baryon / meson ratio @xmath39 that decreases with centrality in a finite @xmath1 window as illustrated in figs .  1 and 3 . for @xmath40  gev the ratios reduce below unity and follow the perturbative calculation",
    "we have extended recent studies of the @xmath1-differential @xmath2 , @xmath3 ratios  @xcite ( fig .  1 ) to @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "similar enhancement pattern if found at moderate @xmath41  gev .",
    "its centrality dependence is predicted to be weak .",
    "figs .  2 and  4",
    "show that in central reactions the predicted @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios are @xmath1-independent up to @xmath42  gev . at larger transverse momenta they decrease and approach perturbative estimates  @xcite .",
    "we propose that the non - perturbative baryon dynamics may extend to @xmath43  gev .",
    "the enhanced baryon and antibaryon production at moderate transverse momenta accounts for the difference in the suppression factor @xmath44 of inclusive charged hadrons and neutral pions  @xcite ( see fig .  5 ) . we have demonstrated that when the non - perturbative baryon contribution becomes small @xmath44 is approximately equal for all hadron species .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  6 for @xmath45",
    "the first rhic run at @xmath10  gev up to @xmath46  gev the suppression factor is found to have a value @xmath47 and is almost independent of the transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "we have performed pqcd calculations at the highest rhic energy of @xmath20  gev that also predict a constant suppression factor @xmath44 .",
    "the detailed @xmath44 behavior is shown to be a consequence of the combination of cronin effect , shadowing , energy loss , and the computable shape of the underlying jet distributions .",
