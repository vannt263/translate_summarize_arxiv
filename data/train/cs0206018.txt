    "the areas of graph drawing and information visualization have seen significant growth in recent years .",
    "often the visualization problems involve taking information in the form of graphs and displaying them in a manner that both is aesthetically pleasing and conveys some meaning .",
    "the aesthetic criteria by itself are the topic of much debate and research , but some generally accepted and tested standards include preferences for straight - line edges or those with only a few bends , a limited number of crossings , good separation of vertices and edges , as well as a small overall area .",
    "some graphs change over the course of time and in such cases it is often important to preserve the `` mental map '' .",
    "that is , slight changes in the graph structure should not yield large changes in the actual drawing of the graph .",
    "vertices should remain roughly near their previous locations and edges should be routed in roughly the same manner as before .    due to the complexity of the problem with general types of graphs , a great deal of the current theoretical research",
    "has dealt with planar graphs . in this area , much progress has been made ; see  @xcite for an overview .",
    "on the other hand , since the problem is np - hard in the general case , many of the more practical applications using general graphs have been studied with heuristic implementations demonstrating their effectiveness .    from a theoretical point - of - view",
    ", one recent trend in research has been to address the topic of thickness of graphs  @xcite .",
    "the thickness of a graph is the minimum number of planar subgraphs into which the graph can be partitioned .",
    "similar to a common technique in vlsi design , the graph is embedded in _ layers_. any two edges drawn in the same layer can only intersect at a common vertex , and vertices are placed are placed in the same location across all layers .",
    "thus , the property of _ graph thickness _ formalizes the notion of layered drawing of graphs .",
    "the thickness of a graph is defined as the minimum number of layers for which a drawing of @xmath3 exists , in which edges can be drawn as jordan curves  @xcite .",
    "a related graph property is _ geometric thickness _ and defined as the minimum number of layers for which a drawing of @xmath3 exists , in which all edges are drawn as straight - line segments  @xcite . finally , _",
    "book thickness _ of a graph is the minimum number of layers for which a drawing of @xmath3 exists , in which edges are drawn as straight - line segments and vertices are in convex position  @xcite .",
    "we look at this problem almost in reverse .",
    "assume we are given the layered subgraphs and now wish to embed the various layers so that the vertices coincide and so that no edges cross .",
    "we wish to simultaneously draw the layered subgraphs , that is , we wish to display several graphs using the same set of vertices but different sets of edges .",
    "take , for example , two graphs from the 1998 worldcup ; see fig .  [ figure - soccer ] .",
    "one of the graphs is a tree illustrating the games played .",
    "the other is a graph showing the major exporters and importers of players on the club level . in displaying the information",
    ", one could certainly look at the two graphs separately , but then there would be little correspondence between the two layouts if they were created independently , since the viewer has no `` mental map '' between the two graphs . using a simultaneous embedding ,",
    "the vertices could be placed in the exact same locations for both graphs and the relationships become more clear .",
    "this is different than simply merging the two graphs together and displaying the information as one large graph .         in simultaneous embeddings , we are concerned with crossings but not between edges belonging to different layers ( and thus different graphs ) . in the merged version",
    ", the graph drawing algorithm used loses all information about the separation of the two graphs and so must also avoid such non - essential crossings .",
    "the techniques for displaying simultaneous embeddings are also quite varied .",
    "one may choose to draw all graphs simultaneously , employing different edge styles , colors , and thickness for each edge set .",
    "one may choose a more three - dimensional approach to giving a visual difference between layers .",
    "one may also choose to show only one graph at a time and allow the users to choose which graph they wish to see ; however , the vertices would not move , only the edge sets would change .",
    "finally , one may highlight one set of edges over another giving the effect of bolding certain graphs .",
    "the subject of simultaneous embeddings has many different variants , several of which we address here .",
    "the two main classifications we consider are embeddings with ( and without ) predefined vertex mappings .",
    "* * simultaneous ( geometric ) embeddings with mapping : * given @xmath4 planar graphs @xmath5 for @xmath6 , find plane straight - line drawings @xmath7 of @xmath8 such that for every @xmath9 and any two drawings @xmath7 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is mapped to the same point on the plane in both drawings . *",
    "* simultaneous ( geometric ) embeddings without mapping : * given @xmath4 planar graphs @xmath12 for @xmath6 , find a one - to - one mapping among all pairs of vertices in @xmath13 such that a simultaneous ( geometric ) embedding with this mapping exists .    the problem of simultaneous embedding of @xmath4 graphs with given mapping can be seen as testing whether the combined graph ( in which the edges set is the union of the edge sets of the given graphs ) has geometric thickness @xmath4 .",
    "that is , if the @xmath4 graphs can be embedded simultaneously , then the thickness of the combined graph is at most @xmath4 , while the opposite direction is not necessarily true .",
    "a similar relationship exists between the problem of simultaneous embedding of a graph when the mapping is not given and testing for the geometric thickness of the combined graph .",
    "note that in the final drawing a crossing between two edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 is allowed _ only if _ there does not exist an edge set @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "the following table summarizes our current results regarding the two versions under various constraints on the type of graphs given .",
    "each column indicates the size of the integer grid required , with the expression `` not possible '' indicating that there exist graphs of this category that do not have embeddings .",
    "computing straight - line embeddings of planar graphs on the integer grid is a well - studied graph drawing problem .",
    "the first solution to this problem is given by de fraysseix , pach and pollack  @xcite using a canonical labeling of the vertices in an algorithm that embeds a planar graph on @xmath18 vertices on the @xmath19 integer grid .",
    "schnyder  @xcite presents a barycentric coordinates method that reduces the grid size to @xmath20 .",
    "the algorithm of chrobak and kant  @xcite embeds a 3-connected planar graph on a @xmath20 grid so that each face is convex .",
    "miura , nakano , and nishizeki  @xcite further restrict the graphs under consideration to 4-connected planar graphs and present an algorithm for straight - line embeddings of such graphs on a @xmath21 grid .",
    "another related problem is that of simultaneously embedding more than one planar graph , not necessarily on the same point set . in a paper dating back to 1963 , tutte  @xcite shows that there exists a simultaneous straight - line representation of a planar graph and its dual in which the only intersections are between corresponding primal - dual edges .",
    "bern and gilbert  @xcite address a variation of the problem : finding suitable locations for dual vertices , given a straight - line planar embedding of a planar graph , so that the edges of the dual graph are also straight - line segments and cross only their corresponding primal edges .",
    "they present a linear time algorithm for the problem in the case of convex 4-sided faces and show that the problem is np - hard for the case of convex 5-sided faces .",
    "erten and kobourov  @xcite present an algorithm for embedding a planar graph and its dual on the @xmath0 grid so that both graphs are drawn with straight lines , every dual vertex is inside its corresponding face , and the only crossings are between primal - dual edge pairs .",
    "let @xmath5 for @xmath22 be @xmath4 graphs with the same vertex set but different edge sets .",
    "a @xmath4-layer geometric embedding of @xmath23 is a straight line drawing of @xmath24 such that two edges intersect only at a common vertex or if they belong to different edge sets .",
    "this broad description of the problem has many different variants and many questions still unanswered .",
    "we first address the simplest problem : embedding paths .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be 2 paths on the same vertex set of size @xmath18",
    ". then a @xmath27-layer geometric embedding of @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be found in linear time and on an @xmath2 grid .",
    "[ the - two - path - theorem ]    observe that if a path is placed with neighboring vertices in increasing @xmath28-order , then the embedding will always be a straight - line drawing with no crossings regardless of the value of @xmath29 .",
    "that is , if @xmath11 and @xmath30 are two vertices on path @xmath31 such that @xmath11 comes before @xmath30 in the path then @xmath32 .",
    "the same relationship holds if we interchange @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : two - paths ] . for",
    "a vertex @xmath11 let @xmath33 be the vertex s position in the path @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ". then the vertex @xmath11 is placed at grid position @xmath36 .",
    "thus , vertices in the first path are positioned in increasing @xmath28-order , and vertices in the second path are positioned in increasing @xmath29-order . from the above observation , we know that neither path is self - intersecting .    insert figure : 2-paths    this simple algorithm does not seem to extend to more than two paths .",
    "moreover , we can prove that five paths can not be simultaneously embedded ( using a given vertex mapping ) .",
    "there exist five paths @xmath37 on the same vertex set @xmath38 such that at least one of the layers _ must _ have a crossing .",
    "a path of @xmath18 vertices is simply on ordered sequence of @xmath18 numbers .",
    "this makes identifying paths a bit easier .",
    "the five paths are quite simple : 12345 , 13542 , 25134 , 32415 , 35214 . for example , the sequence @xmath39 represents the path @xmath40 .",
    "we first point out that any five - vertex path is a subset of the complete graph of 5 vertices , @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the union of the five five - vertex paths is a subset of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , any @xmath42-layer embedding will be a subset of some drawing of @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath41 can not be drawn without a crossing , at least two edges , say @xmath14 and @xmath15 , must cross .",
    "this does not immediately imply that a path crosses itself , only that two paths could cross each other . since the paths are subsets of @xmath41 they would only self - intersect if edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 were both present in the same path .    however , the choice of edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 is up to the embedder .",
    "therefore , we must construct a set of paths such that any pairing of edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 occurs in at least one path .",
    "for example , let us assume that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and that the five vertices are placed such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 cross . for notation , this pairing is labeled as @xmath45 .",
    "then , we must guarantee that there is at least one path in our set such that the sequence @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) both appear .",
    "since two edges can not intersect if they share a vertex in common , all four vertices in the pairing must be distinct , so , there are 15 possible edge pairings for @xmath41 .",
    "any path of length five can `` eliminate '' at most three pairings .",
    "for example , the path @xmath50 eliminates three pairings , @xmath51 , @xmath45 , and @xmath52 , and no others .",
    "thus , we need a _",
    "minimum _ of five paths to guarantee a crossing .",
    "a careful study of the five paths above reveals that all such edge pairings are present in at least one path .",
    "therefore , these five paths can not simultaneously be embedded without at least one path self - crossing .",
    "a simple consequence of this proof is that any four paths of five vertices _ can _ be embedded .",
    "thus , if were to show that three or four paths can not always be simultaneously embedded we must use paths with more than five vertices .",
    "we , therefore , must leave the question open for three and four paths .",
    "we now look at a few more variants of the problem .",
    "a caterpillar graph is a simple tree consisting of a path of vertices and a set of zero or more legs .",
    "let us first define the specific notion of a caterpillar graph .",
    "is drawn with solid edges .",
    "the vertices on the top row form the spine and the vertices on the bottom row form the legs of the caterpillar .",
    "the caterpillar can be traversed in the order indicated by the dashed curve , thus creating the path @xmath53 .",
    ", width=226 ]    a caterpillar graph @xmath54 is a tree consisting of two sets of vertices @xmath55 and @xmath56 and two sets of edges @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ( unique ) parent of @xmath60 in @xmath61 .",
    "we denote @xmath61 as the set of _ parent _ vertices and @xmath62 as the set of leg vertices .",
    "furthermore , for notation we let @xmath63 be the @xmath64-th vertex with parent @xmath65 .",
    "we shall often refer to the path formed by @xmath66 as the * spine * of @xmath67 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure - caterpillar ] .",
    "[ lemma - general - position ] let @xmath68 be a set of @xmath18 points located on an @xmath0 integer grid .",
    "we can refine the grid into an @xmath1 grid so that no three points are collinear .",
    "we start by making a square @xmath69 of unit side length , centered around each point @xmath33 .",
    "now we decompose each square @xmath69 into an @xmath70 grid , so that the overall grid size is @xmath1 . we will now proceed to relocate each point @xmath33 inside @xmath69 incrementally so that @xmath33 is not collinear with any two ( previously placed ) points @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "we can do this for the first two points , leaving them in their original positions .",
    "thus , let us assume we have placed the first @xmath73 points and wish to place @xmath33 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath74 lines defined by the previously placed points .",
    "let @xmath75 be the number of horizontal lines passing through @xmath76 .",
    "each horizontal line through @xmath76 kills @xmath77 grid points and every other line kills @xmath78 .",
    "then collectively @xmath79 pairs kill @xmath80 points . since @xmath75 is at most @xmath81 , in total @xmath82 grid points of @xmath76",
    "get killed which leaves us with an option to displace @xmath33 so that it is not collinear with two other displaced vertices , and by induction we are done .",
    "any two caterpillar graphs have a 2-layer geometric embedding with grid size @xmath83 .",
    "we first transform each caterpillar graph @xmath84 and @xmath85 into a path .",
    "let @xmath86 be a caterpillar and let @xmath87 represent the `` degree '' of @xmath88 as the number of children in @xmath62 with parent @xmath33 .. we connect the path with the following vertex ordering @xmath89 .",
    "that is , we start with the first parent , then its children in order , then the next parent , and its children , until we have the entire path constructed .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the converted path graph .",
    "let @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the two paths formed from the caterpillar graphs .",
    "we use the technique from theorem  [ the - two - path - theorem ] to embed the two paths on an @xmath2 grid .",
    "we now increase the grid resolution to @xmath83 by taking each unit grid location in the original embedding and refining it into an @xmath92 grid .",
    "notice that the paths are still embedded properly as the only condition is that each point in a path be in increasing @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) order .",
    "we now apply lemma  [ lemma - general - position ] to yield a new embedding of the paths such that the points are guaranteed to be in general position .",
    "it is easy to see that the paths are still properly placed since each point is placed inside a square of unit length centered around the original point location so that the relative @xmath28 ( and @xmath29)order of the points remain the same .",
    "now , we construct the caterpillar embedding by using the same points and removing all edges replacing them with the edges from the caterpillar . to see that the graph is properly embedded we simply need to look at any parent vertex @xmath33 and prove none of its edges intersect any other edges .",
    "this is where the ordering of the path becomes significant . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us look at the caterpillar @xmath67 whose path was formed along the @xmath28 direction .",
    "since no three points are collinear , we can connect all `` leg '' edges between @xmath33 and its children as well as connecting @xmath33 with @xmath93 ( and symmetrically @xmath94 without introducing any crossing among these edges .",
    "let @xmath95 be any parent vertex such that @xmath96 ; i.e , @xmath95 came before @xmath33 .",
    "from the embedding technique , we know that the x - coordinate of @xmath95 is less than @xmath33 s .",
    "if we look at the edge from @xmath95 to @xmath97 either @xmath98 or else the edge from @xmath95 to @xmath97 must lie complete to the left of @xmath33 and its edges and thus not intersect .",
    "similarly , if we look at the edge from @xmath95 to any of its children , which also come before @xmath33 in the path ordering , we see that that edge must also lie completely to the left of @xmath33 and its edges .",
    "therefore , the caterpillar graph is properly embedded and we are done .",
    "we believe that this space constraint can be reduced . as a first step in this direction",
    "we argue that a path and a caterpillar can be embedded in a much smaller area as the following theorem shows .",
    "given a path @xmath99 and a caterpillar graph @xmath67 , we can simultaneously embed them on an @xmath100 grid .",
    "we embed these using much the same method as embedding two paths with one exception , that we allow some vertices to share the same @xmath28-coordinate . for a vertex @xmath11 let @xmath101 denote @xmath11 s position in @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath11 is in @xmath61 , i.e. a parent vertex in @xmath67 , then let @xmath102 be its position among the parent path , disregarding the legs , and @xmath11 is initially embedded at the location @xmath103 . otherwise , @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 be its parent s position and initially embed @xmath11 at the location @xmath106 .",
    "we now proceed to attach the edges .",
    "clearly the path works properly if we preserve the @xmath29-ordering of the points . in our embedding , we may need to shift , but we shall only perform right shifts .",
    "that is , we shall push points to the right of a vertex @xmath11 by one unit right , in essence inserting one extra grid location when necessary .",
    "notice this step will preserve the @xmath29-ordering . to attach the caterpillar edges ,",
    "let us march along the spine .",
    "we shall guarantee that for any parent vertex @xmath33 that no edges extending from a vertex @xmath95 with @xmath96 intersect with any other placed vertices .",
    "that is , none of the edges up to @xmath33 intersect .",
    "clearly , this works for @xmath107 as there are no edges yet placed .",
    "let us then assume it holds for @xmath33 . to show it hold for @xmath93 we must properly place @xmath33 so that none of its edges intersect any others .",
    "since all of the legs of @xmath33 lie on the same @xmath28-coordinate but with differing @xmath29-coordinates and one unit to the right of @xmath33 , we can connect @xmath33 to its legs without any crossings .",
    "also notice that all other previously placed edges lied to the left of @xmath33 and again there could be no crossings .",
    "we must now connect @xmath33 to @xmath93 .",
    "however , it is possible that at most one leg is collinear with @xmath33 and @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", we simply shift @xmath93 and all succeeding points by one unit to the right .",
    "we continue the right shift until none of the legs is collinear with @xmath33 and @xmath93 .",
    "now , the edge @xmath33 to @xmath93 does not intersect another vertex .",
    "the number of shifts we made is bounded by @xmath108 , where @xmath108 is the number of legs of parent vertex @xmath33 .",
    "we continue in this manner until we have attached all edges .",
    "let @xmath4 be the total number of legs of the caterpillar .",
    "then the total number of shifts made is @xmath4 .",
    "since we initially start with @xmath109 columns in our grid , the total number of columns necessary is @xmath110 .",
    "thus , in the worst case the grid size is less than @xmath111 .",
    "there exists a set of three caterpillar graphs that can not be simultaneously embedded .",
    "the result is a direct interpretation of theorem 2 from  @xcite along with its proof .",
    "the author proves that there exists a graph of ( graph ) thickness three with geometric thickness greater than three .",
    "the graph , defined as @xmath112 is defined on @xmath113 vertices representing all possible singleton and tripleton subsets of an @xmath18-element set .",
    "edges are formed between each tripleton vertex and the three singleton vertices forming the subset . since this is a bipartite graph and the tripleton vertices have degree exactly three , we can partition this graph into three subgraphs such that each subgraph is a forest of stars , the centers being the singleton vertices and the three edges from a tripleton vertex belonging to different subgraphs .",
    "the authors then prove that there exist values of @xmath18 such that @xmath112 has geometric thickness greater than three .",
    "this implies that the three subgraphs of stars can not be simultaneously embedded using straight - line edges without crossings . in order that each subgraph be a tree instead of a forest",
    ", we can readily add edges to connect the components while not changing the graph thickness or the geometric thickness .",
    "therefore , the three caterpillar graphs do not have geometric thickness three .    the theorem , although disappointing , still leaves open the question of whether two general trees can be simultaneously embedded even if they have bounded ( not necessarily constant ) degree .     and",
    "@xmath114 can not be embedded simultaneously . if a simultaneous embedding were possible that embedding would force three vertices on the outer face .",

    "as figure  [ general ] illustrates , regardless of the embedding chosen there must exist at least one external triangular face shared by both , but the graphs do not have any faces in common .",
    "in the following subsections we present methods to embed different classes of graphs simultaneously when no mapping between the vertices are provided . for the remainder of this section , when we say simultaneous embeddings we always mean without vertex mappings .",
    "the following theorem summarizes our results on simultaneously embedding an outerplanar graph and a general planar graph .",
    "[ general - outerplanar ] two planar graphs @xmath115 and @xmath114 each with @xmath18 vertices can be simultaneously embedded ( without mapping ) on an @xmath1 grid if one of the graphs is outerplanar .",
    "we start by showing how to find a straight - line embedding of a planar graph @xmath3 on the grid with the _ general position requirement _ , i.e. , no three vertices of @xmath3 lie on a line .",
    "we first present an algorithm that requires @xmath116 size grid .",
    "then we improve the grid size to be @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by drawing the given graph @xmath3 in an @xmath0 integer grid , @xmath117 .",
    "this step can be done using one of the grid - drawing algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the resulting drawing has potentially many collinearities among the vertices .",
    "however , any vertex @xmath30 that is _ not _ collinear with a line through vertices @xmath118 and @xmath11 must be at least @xmath119 away from the line @xmath120 .",
    "we leave the details of this claim out of the abstract .    next , we center an axis - aligned square , @xmath121 , of side length @xmath119 on each vertex @xmath122 . by the property above , if vertices @xmath118 , @xmath11 , and @xmath30 are _ not _ collinear in the embedding of @xmath3 , then @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are also not collinear , for any choice of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . now ,",

    "thus , an @xmath116 grid is sufficient for a general position embedding of a planar graph on @xmath18 vertices .      in order to improve the grid size",
    "we make the following observation : in the preceding argument the necessary condition was that given @xmath118 , @xmath11 , @xmath30 that are not collinear , for any choice of @xmath126 , @xmath129 , and @xmath128 then @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are also not collinear",

    "we use the algorithm of  @xcite to initially draw the graph to guarantee this new property .",

    "take any prime number @xmath31 slightly larger than @xmath18 then take the points @xmath142 for @xmath143 .",
    "these points are in general position .",
    "the following extensions of this work remains open :    * can general planar graphs be simultaneously embedded without mapping ? * can 3 or 4 paths be embedded simultaneous with mapping ?",
    "we would like to thank anna lubiw for introducing us to the problem of simultaneous graph embedding .",
    "we would also like to thank ed scheinerman , carola wenk , peter brass , and dean starrett for stimulating discussions about different variations of the problem ."
