    "two - phase heterogeneous media ( textures ) abound in nature and synthetic situations .",
    "examples include manufactured heterogeneous materials ( e.g. , composites , porous media and colloids ) @xcite , geologic media ( e.g. , rock formations ) @xcite , cellular materials @xcite , ecological structures ( e.g. , tree patterns in forests ) @xcite , cosmological structures ( e.g. , galaxy distributions ) @xcite , and biological media ( e.g. , animal and plant tissue ) @xcite . in general , the complex microstructures of random media can only be characterized via certain statistical descriptors , such as an infinite set of @xmath0-point correlation functions @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the effective physical properties of heterogeneous media , such as the conductivity @xcite , elastic moduli @xcite , fluid permeability @xcite , trapping constant @xcite and electromagnetic wave characteristics @xcite , can be expressed in terms of weighted functionals of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 gives the probability of finding @xmath0 points positioned at @xmath5 all in the phase of interest @xcite .",
    "for statistically homogeneous media which are the focus of this paper , @xmath1 is translationally invariant and hence depends only on the relative displacements of the positions with respect to some arbitrarily chosen origin , say @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 with @xmath8 . in such cases , the one - point correlation function @xmath9 is just equal to the volume fraction of the phase of interest .",
    "if the medium is also statistically isotropic , the two - point correlation function @xmath2 is a radial function , i.e. , @xmath10 , providing information about the distribution of pair - separation distances .",
    "@xmath11{fig1a.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=4.5cm , keepaspectratio]{fig1b.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    although the @xmath1 can be represented analytically for certain models @xcite and bounded for general media @xcite , it is usually not possible to compute all of the @xmath1 in the infinite set .",
    "thus , it is desirable to understand the extent to which one can characterize the structure and properties of heterogeneous media using lower - order correlation functions , such as the two - point correlation function @xmath2 .",
    "a powerful means to study this problem and related questions is to employ inverse techniques @xcite whereby one attempts to reconstruct ( or construct ) realizations of heterogeneous media that match limited structural information of those media in the form of lower - order correlation functions , obtained either experimentally or from theoretical considerations @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the reconstruction of digitized representations of heterogeneous materials from a prescribed two - point correlation function @xmath2 has been receiving considerable attention @xcite .",
    "an effective reconstruction procedure enables one to generate accurate renditions of the medium at will and subsequent analysis can be performed on the reconstruction to obtain desired macroscopic properties of the medium non - destructively .",
    "it has been well established @xcite that @xmath2 is generally devoid of crucial information to uniquely determine the structure of the medium . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we employed inverse `` reconstruction '' techniques to probe the information content of the widest class of different types of two - point functions .",
    "this set of functions includes the standard two - point correlation function @xmath2 , surface - void @xmath12 and surface - surface @xmath13 correlation functions @xcite , lineal - path function @xmath14 @xcite , chord - length probability density function @xmath15 @xcite , the pore - size function @xmath16 @xcite , and the two - point cluster function @xmath17 @xcite . by numerically reconstructing two - phase heterogeneous media from these correlation functions",
    ", we unambiguously showed that @xmath2 does not suffice for a unique reconstruction and that incorporating @xmath17 , which is sensitive to topological connectedness information , can lead to a much more accurate rendition of the target medium .",
    "it is worth noting that in most numerical reconstructions , @xmath2 of the reconstructed medium only matches that of the target medium within certain numerical accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that the idea that @xmath2 is generally devoid of crucial structural information still has not been widely appreciated and claims of uniqueness of reconstructions using @xmath2 have been made based on numerical studies @xcite .",
    "thus , our work has implications for the fundamental problem of determining the necessary conditions that realizable two - point functions must possess @xcite .    in the first part of this series of two papers @xcite ( henceforth referred to as part i ) , we have shown via concrete examples the existence of distinct point configurations possessing identical sets of pair - separation distances . by appropriately decorating the point configurations , distinct two - phase media with identical @xmath2",
    "can be constructed ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in general",
    ", there are many ways to decorate a point configuration , which enables one to obtain a wide spectrum of distinct heterogeneous media . in this paper",
    ", we focus on characterizing the structural ambiguity of pair statistics as embodied in the two - point correlation function @xmath2 associated with individual realizations of statistically homogeneous two - phase heterogeneous media in a _ mathematically precise _ way , which complements previous numerical studies .",
    "in other words , we provide a mathematical formulation for heterogeneous - media reconstructions and rigorously show that distinct media exist that possess exactly identical two - point correlation functions .",
    "this objective is quite different from the approximate matching of @xmath2 that one encounters in numerical simulations , which are also discussed .",
    "the reconstruction of random textures also has a wide spectrum of applications in vision research @xcite .",
    "it is important to distinguish a popular two - point statistics used in vision research , called the `` dipole histogram '' , from the two - point correlation function of statistically homogeneous media .",
    "the dipole histogram is a particular statistics of the vector pair displacements in a _",
    "texture @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the distinguishable vector pair displacement with the largest length can always be identified together with the positions of the two points that give rise to the displacement .",
    "similarly , one can then identify the second largest displacement and the positions of points possessing this displacement , and so on .",
    "finally , the texture can be completely reconstructed from the dipole histogram .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is possible because the information contained in the dipole histogram of a finite texture is not averaged out as that contained in the two - point correlation function of a statistically homogeneous medium . in particular , due to the requirement of translational invariance ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are always imposed for realizations of statistically homogeneous media .",
    "thus , only the probabilities of the occurrence of displacements are given by @xmath2 , obtained by averaging over all available positions in the medium , instead of the indication of the actual occurrence of particular displacements at certain positions provided by the dipole histogram .",
    "it is such additional information contained in the dipole histogram that enables a unique reconstruction .",
    "we will see in the following sections that the position average ( i.e. , volume average ) necessarily leads to the structural ambiguity of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath18{fig2.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    to provide a quantitative characterization of the structural ambiguity of @xmath2 , we first give the relevant definitions here .",
    "two heterogeneous media are identical if they possess identical sets of @xmath0-point correlation functions @xmath1 for @xmath19 .",
    "two heterogeneous media are @xmath20-distinct if they process distinct @xmath0-point correlation functions for all @xmath21 .",
    "a heterogeneous medium is @xmath22-fold degenerate if there exist additional @xmath23 media such that all the @xmath22 media are mutually @xmath24-distinct but possess the same two - point correlation function @xmath2 .",
    "for statistically homogeneous media , the above definition of structural degeneracy rules out the possibility that two degenerate media are trivially connected by a translation , rotation , mirror reflection or any of these combinations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our definition of degeneracy for point configuration in the first part of this series two papers @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider that two media do not form a degenerate pair if they possess phase - inversion symmetry at phase volume fractions 0.5 , i.e. , the morphology of one phase is statistically identical to that of the other phase when the two phases are interchanged @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in part i , given pair statistics in the form of @xmath2 that are associated with degenerate media , it is impossible even in principle to uniquely reconstruct a medium from such @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it is important to determine under what conditions the media possess degenerate counterparts . in this paper",
    ", we provide a systematic approach to characterize the structural degeneracies associated with the two - point correlation function for both continuous two - phase heterogeneous media and their digitized representations .",
    "in particular , we derive the exact conditions for the existence of degeneracy in terms of integral equations for continuous media and algebraic equations for the digitized representations .",
    "we show by examining the derived equations that for statistically homogeneous and isotropic media , structural degeneracies generally exist .",
    "this explains the long observed non - uniqueness of reconstructions using radial averaged @xmath2 in many studies @xcite .",
    "we also provide a variety of concrete examples of degenerate two - phase media , including both analytical constructions and numerical simulations , which respectively are exact and approximate solutions of the degeneracy equations .",
    "these examples include analytically constructed patterns composed of building blocks bearing the letter `` t '' and the word `` water '' , degenerate barlow films ( i.e. , stacking variants of the densest sphere packing in three dimensions ) as well as numerical reconstructions of polycrystal microstructures , laser - speckle patterns and sphere packings .",
    "moreover , we discuss the degeneracy of multiphase media and additional structural information that can be incorporated to significantly reduce structural degeneracy of heterogeneous media @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the mathematical model of two - phase heterogeneous media and derive the conditions of degeneracy . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide the examples of degeneracies for both continuous media and their digitized representations . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the degeneracy of multiphase media and additional structural information that would be used to reduce degeneracy . in sec .",
    "v , we make concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we derive the exact mathematical conditions under which a statistically homogeneous medium possesses degenerate counterparts . for a continuous medium , these conditions take the form of a set of integral equations of the indicator function ( defined below ) of the phase of interest . for the digitized representations of the medium , which have been extensively investigated in various numerical reconstruction studies , the integral equations reduce to algebraic equations .",

    "if the medium is also ergodic the ensemble average is equivalent to the volume average , i.e. ,    @xmath50    if the medium is also statistically isotropic , @xmath47 is a radial function , depending on the separation distances of point pairs only , i.e. ,    @xmath51    readers are referred to ref .",

    "now consider a change in the geometry of the region of the phase of interest , say phase 1 , that keeps the volume fraction @xmath31 invariant .",
    "the medium after the change is denoted by @xmath53 and recall that the original medium is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the indicator function @xmath54 of phase 1 in @xmath53 is then given by    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the region where phase 1 is found in @xmath53 .",

    "( [ eq00201 ] ) with @xmath59 .",
    "it is obviously that @xmath60 can only take the value of 0 , -1 and 1 . and the requirement that @xmath25 and @xmath53 form a degenerate pair with the same two - point correlation function as well as the same phase volume fractions will lead to constraining equations on @xmath60 , which are the degeneracy conditions we are seeking .    for simplicity , we introduce a short notation for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq00206 ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath61    the requirement that @xmath2 is invariant under the change @xmath62 leads to    @xmath63    substituting ( [ eq203 ] ) into ( [ eq01201 ] ) yields    @xmath64    from eq .",

    "for such isotropic media , it is highly probable to obtain degeneracies of the original medium in a reconstruction .",

    "ii.a , the two - point correlation function @xmath105 contains information on the relative displacements ( vector distances ) between any two points in the phase of interest .",
    "consider a two - phase medium , in which one of the phases is composed of replications of certain substructures .",
    "if the substructures do not possess central inversion symmetry , they can be rotated in a way such that all the relative displacements of point pairs within and among the substructures remain the same yet the overall structure ( the replication of the rotated substructures ) is different from the original one .",
    "a simple example originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the substructure , i.e. , the letter `` t '' , has been arranged into a `` pyramid '' . by rotating each `` t '' about an axis perpendicular to the plane by 180 degrees , a distinct structure can be produced .",
    "since the relative orientation of the position of any pair of letters `` t '' has not changed , the relative displacements of the point pairs , one from each of different `` t '' also remain the same .",
    "it is obvious that the relative displacements of point pairs within any single `` t '' are not affected .",
    "thus , the two distinct structures possess identical statistics of relative displacements of point pairs , i.e. , identical two - point correlation functions @xmath105 , so they form a degenerate pair .",
    "@xmath107{fig4a.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a)}\\\\\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=9.5cm , keepaspectratio]{fig4b.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    fig .",

    "in the best case , the complete set of pair - separation distances can be inferred from @xmath108 .",
    "such distance sets have been studied in detail in part i of this series of two papers , where we have shown that a variety of classes of degeneracies can be identified that are compatible with the given distance set of a point configuration . in particular ,",
    "we pointed out in part i that by decorating the degenerate point configurations properly , degenerate two - phase media can be constructed .",
    "one such example is to decorate the 30 degenerate tetrahedra discussed in part i , e.g. , one can place the centroids of congruent spheres at the vertices of the tetrahedra and choose the `` sphere '' phase as the phase of interest and the space exterior to spheres as `` void '' phase . then the 30 heterogeneous media associated these tetrahedra are degenerate .",
    "another example constructed by decorating a point configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the two circular - disk packings form a degenerate pair .",
    "the packings contain three types of particles : a large number of the circular disks ( shown in black ) form a cluster with central symmetry .",
    "three particles ( shown in blue ) arranged on a straight line form a substructure possessing mirror reflection symmetry , i.e. , the two most separated particles are located symmetrically about the one in the middle .",
    "the remaining two ( shown in red ) are placed along a line parallel to that of the three blue particles and going through the center of the symmetric cluster , such that the set of relative distances between any two points in the `` particle '' phase in the two packings are identical while the two resulting structures are distinct .",

    "for example , applying the construction rule for the degenerate circular - disk packings in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] to a two - dimensional square - lattice of pixels results in the degenerate digitized media shown in fig .",
    "the only difference is an additional requirement that for digitized media the values of the distances must be square roots of integers and the symmetry groups of the structures are discrete , which reduces the total number of possible degeneracies .",
    "another class of interesting degeneracy examples associated with radially averaged @xmath2 involves the barlow packings , i.e. , random stackings of infinite triangular - lattice layers of spheres . in a barlow packing , for a particular layer",
    "( i.e. , layer `` a '' ) there are only two possible positions for the next layer , which we denote by the usual code as `` b '' and `` c '' , respectively .",
    "thus , a barlow packing can be represented by a sequence of `` a '' , `` b '' and `` c '' , e.g. , `` @xmath109abcbca@xmath109 '' .",
    "a barlow film is a barlow packing consisting of a finite number of layers .",
    "the distribution of pair distances in such a geometry depends not only on how many layers are present , but also upon whether any chosen pair of layers is the same species ( `` aa '' , `` bb '' , or `` cc '' ) , or different species ( `` ab '' , `` ac '' , or `` bc '' ) .",
    "this motivates counting `` same '' versus `` different '' species for each separation distance between layer pairs . the distance distribution ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) is completely determined by the number of same species at all separation distances between layer pairs .    for an @xmath0-layer barlow film ,",
    "there are nominally @xmath110 possible configurations . however , not all of these @xmath110 configurations are distinct .",
    "a basic property of barlow films is that the distance distribution is invariant under a `` renaming '' operation .",
    "for example , the sequences `` abcabc '' , `` bcabca '' and `` cabcab '' possess the same structure . in light of this `` renaming '' invariance , we can require that the first two layers for all barlow films to be `` ab@xmath109 '' without loss of generality . thus , the number of distinct configurations associated with an @xmath0-layer barlow film that possess the same vertical distances between identical layers ( i.e. , the same distance distributions ) is reduced to @xmath111 . as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , reflection ( mirror image ) symmetry should also be excluded for degenerate pairs .",
    ".the number of the same species ( `` aa '' , `` bb '' or `` cc '' ) at different layer - separation distances for the 6-layer degenerate barlow pair `` ababac '' and `` ababcb '' .",
    "@xmath112 is the layer separation distance . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    the numbers of degenerate configurations for @xmath113 $ ] are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we note that the first degenerate triplet occurs at @xmath114 , which includes the configurations `` ababcbacac '' , `` ababcbcbac '' and `` abacbcbcac '' .",
    "we do nt find any four - fold degenerate barlow films for the @xmath0 values we examined .",
    "it can be seen from the table that except for the trivial cases with @xmath115 and @xmath116 the numbers of degeneracies possess the following trends : i ) for both the even - layer and the odd - layer films , the number and complexity of degeneracies increase monotonically as the number of layers increases ; ( ii ) the number of degeneracies associated with an even layer is larger than that of the next odd layer .",
    "the latter trend is probably due to the odd layers having relatively fewer degrees of freedom to exclude the `` renaming '' and reflection symmetry .",
    "it is also worth noting that if a honeycomb crystal packing of spheres are used for the layers instead of triangular - lattice packings , one can construct degenerate low - density jammed sphere packings @xcite .",
    "in particular , a honeycomb crystal layer can be obtained by removing one third of the spheres from the triangular - lattice layer .",
    "these removed spheres are also arranged on a triangular lattice , but with lattice vectors that are twice in magnitude of those of the original triangular lattice . to obtain honeycomb crystal films from two degenerate barlow films ,",
    "exactly the same pair distances are removed associated with the removing of the spheres .",
    "thus , the two constructed honeycomb crystal films also form a degenerate pair .",
    "so far , we have not found any degeneracy in the periodic barlow films .      in many practical applications ,",

    "the two - point quantities are superior to @xmath24 in that their determination requires less effort and they are sensitive to nontrivial structural information that is not explicitly contained in @xmath24 , such as the topologically connectedness information .",

    "if we increase the size of the circular disks while keeping their centers fixed , there exists a critical disk diameter at which the three disks in the medium bearing the `` kite '' structure form a connected `` triangle '' , which is separated from the remaining disk ; while in the medium bearing the `` trapezoid '' structure all the disks belong to a single linear cluster . because the connected `` triangle '' of disks only exists in the medium bearing the `` kite '' structure , the degenerate pair",
    "now can be distinguished , i.e. , the degeneracy is reduced by using the connectedness ( i.e. , clustering ) information .",
    "it is clear that in this case the clustering information reflects nontrivial triangle information in the system , which is contained in @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper , we discussed various aspects of the structural degeneracy associated with the two - point correlation function @xmath2 of heterogeneous media .",
    "complementary to previous studies , here we provide precise mathematical formulations for structural degeneracy and rigorously show that distinct media with exactly identical @xmath2 do exist . in particular , we derived the exact conditions for the existence of degeneracy in terms of integral equations for continuous media and algebraic equations for their digitized representations . by examining the equations and constructing their solutions for specific examples ,",
