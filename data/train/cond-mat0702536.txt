    "layered high - temperature superconducting materials , such as bi@xmath0sr@xmath1cacu@xmath0o@xmath2 ( bscco ) , are composed of superconducting cuprate layers coupled by josephson interaction . this system possesses the josephson effects at the atomic scale ( `` intrinsic josephson effect '' ) . a rich spectrum of classical _ dc _ and _ ac _ josephson phenomena have been observed in this system , see reviews .    in a bulky superconductor",
    "the magnetic field applied along the layers generates a triangular lattice of josephson vortices .",
    "the anisotropy factor @xmath3 and the interlayer periodicity @xmath4 set the important field scale , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 0.5 tesla for bscco ) .",
    "when the magnetic field exceeds @xmath7 the josephson vortices homogeneously fill all layers.@xcite strong coupling between the vortex arrays in neighboring layers mediated by the in - plane supercurrents @xcite determines the static and dynamic properties of the lattice .",
    "dynamic properties of the josephson - vortex lattice in bscco have been extensively studied by several experimental groups ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "when an external transport current flowing across the layers exceeds the _ critical current _ , the josephson vortex lattice starts to move . in a homogeneous junction",
    "the critical current is determined by interaction with the boundaries .",
    "the simplest and most known case is a single small junction without inhomogeneities , where the field dependence of the critical current is given by the fraunhofer dependence , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the magnetic flux through the junction .",
    "observation of this dependence has been considered as an important confirmation of the _ dc _ josephson effect.@xcite the same dependence is also expected for the junction stack with the lateral size smaller than the josephson length.@xcite in a single long junction the critical current has the rather complicated field dependence due to multiple coexistent states of the lattice.@xcite    in the previous paper we considered the behavior of the critical current for the dense josephson - vortex lattice in a homogeneous wide stack for which the critical current is caused by interaction with the boundaries .",
    "we found that the boundary induces an alternating deformation of the lattice . averaging out the rapid phase oscillations",
    ", we obtained that the lattice deformation obeys the sine - gordon equation and decays inside superconductor at the typical length @xmath10 , which is larger than the josephson length , @xmath11 , and increases proportional to the magnetic field , @xmath12 .@xcite the stack is in the wide - stack regime if its lateral width @xmath13 is larger than this typical length .",
    "in this situation the surface deformation and the total current flowing along the surface is uniquely determined by the lattice position far away from the boundaries .",
    "the surface current has oscillating dependence on the lattice displacement and , due to the triangular - lattice ground state , the period of this dependence is half the lattice spacing .",
    "the total current flowing through the stack is given by the sum of two independent surface currents flowing at the sample edges .",
    "the magnetic field determines the magnitude of the maximum surface current ( it is inversely proportional to the field ) and sets the phase shift between the oscillating dependences of the two surface currents on the lattice position .",
    "one can trace that , due to the half - lattice - spacing periodicity of the surface current , a full period change of this phase shift corresponds to the change of the magnetic flux through one junction , @xmath9 , equal to the half flux quantum , @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximum current through the stack has oscillating field dependence , which resembles the fraunhofer dependence : it has strong oscillations and overall @xmath15 dependence .",
    "however , the period of these oscillations is two times smaller : it corresponds to adding one flux quantum per two junctions and the critical current has local maxima at @xmath16 .",
    "oscillations of the flux - flow voltage in bscco mesas at slow lattice motion have been observed by ooi _",
    "_ the oscillations have the period of @xmath14 per junctions and are caused the size - matching effect described in the previous paragraph .",
    "these oscillations have been reproduced by numerical simulations.@xcite more recently the flux - flow oscillations in bscco mesas have been reproduced and studied in more details by several experimental groups.@xcite similar oscillations also have been observed in underdoped yba@xmath0ca@xmath17o@xmath18.@xcite size dependence of oscillations has been systematically studied in refs .. it was found that at smaller lateral sizes and/or higher magnetic fields the crossover to the new oscillation regime takes place , in which the period becomes @xmath19 per junction , as in a single junction .",
    "being motivated by recent experiments , in this paper we extend our consideration to the regime when the junction size @xmath13 is comparable with the length @xmath20 and the system crosses over from the wide - stack to narrow - stack regime .",
    "as the length scale @xmath20 increases with the magnetic field , it also sets the field scale @xmath21 , at which this length becomes of the order of the junction length @xmath13 .",
    "therefore for a junction of a given size the crossover to the narrow - stack regime can be driven by the magnetic field , as it was observed experimentally.@xcite @xmath14-periodicity of the critical - current oscillations holds until interactions between surface deformations can be neglected .",
    "this interaction becomes progressively stronger with decreasing the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "surface deformations at @xmath23 can be described as partial sine - gordon solitons.@xcite the relative sign of two solitons at the opposite edges is determined by the magnetic field and the lattice positions . at the integer - flux - quanta points",
    "@xmath24 the surface solitons always have the same sign and repel each other . as a consequence , the amplitude of surface deformations drops and the critical current decreases . at the half - integer - flux - quanta points @xmath25",
    "situation is the opposite : the surface solitons always have opposite signs and attract each other leading to enhancement of the surface deformations and increase of the critical current .",
    "therefore the interaction between the surface solitons leads to the crossover between the @xmath14-periodic oscillations of the critical current and @xmath19-periodic oscillations .",
    "this crossover occurs via suppression of the current peaks at the points @xmath24 and enhancement of the current peaks at the points @xmath25 .",
    "such behavior is consistent with recent studies of the oscillations of the flux - flow voltage in mesas with small lateral sizes.@xcite the crossover in the voltage oscillations also has been studied numerically.@xcite    in the region @xmath26 the lattice structure is determined by competition between two energies : the interaction with boundaries and the bulk shearing interaction between the josephson - vortex planar arrays in neighboring layers .",
    "the interaction with the boundaries favors the aligned rectangular arrangement of the josephson vortices while the local shearing interaction favors the triangular lattice .",
    "the boundary interactions decay slower with increasing field then the shearing interaction and become dominating at large fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary interaction energy has oscillating field dependence and vanishes at the points @xmath24 . at these points",
    "the shearing interaction is relevant at any magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the interaction with the boundaries is suppressed by the external current .    in the region",
    "@xmath27 the rectangular arrangement of vortices is realized in most part of the phase space and the field dependence of the critical current approaches the classical fraunhofer dependence .",
    "two important deviations persist at all fields and sizes : ( i ) near the points @xmath28 the phase transitions to the triangular lattice always take place .",
    "critical current at these points never drops to zero and actually always has a small local maximum ; ( ii ) away from the points @xmath24 the critical current is reached at the instability point of the rectangular vortex lattice and it is always somewhat smaller than the `` fraunhofer '' value , @xmath29 ( left ) the ground - state phase diagram of the junction stack in the field - size plane , where @xmath30 is the reduced magnetic field .",
    "solid lines mark the magnetic fields corresponding to integer values of the magnetic flux per junction and dotted lines show boundaries of the rectangular - lattice regions for zero current through the stack . as one can see , these regions appear above the line @xmath31 and they are always bounded by the integer - flux quanta lines . in the right plot",
