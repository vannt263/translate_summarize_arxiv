    "in the past decade revolutionary progress has been made in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "many baryons with single heavy quark have been observed experimentally @xcite . at the same time",
    "many new charmonium and bottomonium like states have also been discovered @xcite .",
    "these states have more complicated structure compared to the ones predicted by the quark model .",
    "these experimental achievements have carried the studies to a new level , namely , the study of the decays of these baryons . in this work",
    "we concentrate our attention on the heavy baryons with single heavy quark , and investigate their electromagnetic decays .    according to @xmath4 classification , the heavy baryons ground states with spin1/2 belong to the sextet representation ; and with spin3/2 to the sextet and spin1/2 to the anti  triplet representations .",
    "it is customary to denote these representations as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "in this section we derive the light cone qcd sum rules for the radiative @xmath0 and @xmath13 decay form factors . for this purpose",
