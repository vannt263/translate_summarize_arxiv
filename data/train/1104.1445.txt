    "ever since the discovery of the high temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetically ordered phase @xcite , the strength of electronic correlations in iron based superconductors has been a central issue of debate .",
    "significant efforts based on both weak and strong coupling pictures have been made to explain the @xmath8 magnetic order in the parent compounds , and the emergence of superconductivity upon carrier doping .",
    "on one hand , the @xmath8 collinear antiferromagnetic order arises in a weak coupling picture that relies on the presence of quasi - nested electron and hole pockets respectively at @xmath9 and @xmath10 points of the extended brillouin zone @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally observed large electrical resistivity (  bad metal \" with @xmath11 ) , a strong suppression of drude weight @xcite , and the temperature - induced spectral weight transfer @xcite have suggested sizable strength of electronic correlations .",
    "these experimental evidences have suggested the placement of the iron pnictides in close proximity of a putative mott transition @xcite . in a metallic system close to a mott transition",
    ", quasi - local moments are expected to arise , which for the iron pnictides are described in terms of @xmath2 couplings @xcite ; here @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor spin exchange interactions on the iron square lattice .",
    "hence in the strong coupling scenario , the @xmath8 collinear antiferromagnetic order in these materials can be described in terms of such a @xmath2 model .",
    "this picture is further supported by the experimental observation of zone boundary spin wave excitations in the magnetically ordered state at low temperatures @xcite . when protected by the broken symmetry",
    ", many low energy properties of the ordered state have been addressed using either strong or weak coupling approaches , and this has contributed to the dilemma over the strength of electronic correlations .    for 11-iron chalcogenides",
    "@xmath14 @xcite , a nesting based approach fails to describe the magnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "these materials have been shown to exhibit both commensurate and incommensurate antiferromagnetic state with a large magnetic moment @xmath15 .",
    "however it should be noted that in spite of the stronger correlations in 11-chalcogenides in comparison to pnictides , the parent compound @xmath16 is still metallic .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in the new 122 iron - chalcogenides @xmath17 @xcite , in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic state with a @xmath18 , promises to shed new light on both the role of electronic correlations and nature of magnetism and superconductivity . in these 122 iron - chalcogenides , there are parent compounds which are antiferromagnetically ordered and insulating @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both the angle resolved photoemission experiments @xcite and band structure calculations @xcite reveal unique fermiology . unlike the pnictides , there are no hole fermi pockets ; the fermi surface is entirely made up of electron fermi pockets , with the dominant pieces located near the m points of the extended brillouin zone .",
    "the bare magnetic susceptibility @xmath19 for these new materials , as determined from the band structure , is weakly peaked around @xmath20 , and can not explain the origin of the observed complex magnetic order with a large magnetic moment ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 which is intertwined with iron vacancy order @xcite .",
    "the observation of an insulating state and the emergence of antiferromagnetic order with large moment in the absence of quasi - nested electron and hole pockets certainly point towards stronger electronic correlation effects .",
    "the possible band narrowing effects due to vacancy ordering , and a resulting mott insulating phase for the parent materials has been discussed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the magnetic order and dynamics of an extended @xmath2 model on modulated square lattices . for a lattice ( called @xmath23 below ) appropriate @xcite for the vacancy ordering of a @xmath24 , our analysis builds on the important insights introduced by cao and dai @xcite that vacancy ordering may modulate the exchange interactions .",
    "we show that the experimentally observed block - spin state @xcite occupies a significant portion of the phase diagram , and we discuss the spin dynamics of this phase using a linear spin - wave analysis .",
    "the large unit cell with multiple iron ions leads to both acoustic spin wave and gapped optical spin wave modes . based on our spin wave calculations in different parameter regimes corresponding to the block spin antiferromagnetic phase",
    ", we show how the measurements of spin gaps and degeneracy along the high symmetry directions of the magnetic brillouin zone provide valuable information regarding the signs of the underlying exchange couplings .",
    "we have also analyzed the magnetic phase diagram of a @xmath2 model on two different modulated square lattices ( called @xmath25 and @xmath26 below ) potentially relevant @xcite to @xmath4 , which respectively exhibit @xmath5-depleted @xmath6 and @xmath7 vacancy ordering .",
    "we note that we have not considered the further - neighbor coupling @xmath27 , since the @xmath2 couplings appear to be adequate for @xmath28 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce an extended @xmath2 model , as appropriate for the modulated square lattice @xmath23 with @xmath29 vacancy order ( fig .",

    "the modulated lattice @xmath23 with @xmath0 vacancy order is shown in fig .  [ fig:1a ] . shown here is the structural unit cell comprising four @xmath30 sites and a larger unit cell consisting of eight @xmath30 sites .",
    "the eight site unit cell is the magnetic unit cell of the experimentally relevant block - spin antiferromagnetic state and this also turns out to be convenient to describe other anitiferromagnetic phases to be specified below . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] we show the structural brillouin zone ( sbz ) corresponding to the four - site unit cell and the magnetic brillouin zone of the block - spin antiferromagnetic state ( mbz1 ) corresponding to the eight site unit cell .",
    "a recent dft calculation  @xcite shows that the fe vacancy order induces a tetramer lattice distortion which may strongly influence the superexchange couplings .",
    "this distortion makes the intra - block and inter - block exchange couplings different , and leads to the following modulated @xmath2 hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath31 where the latin indices @xmath32 correspond to the unit cells , each enclosing a single vacancy and comprising four @xmath30 sites .",
    "the greek indices @xmath33 correspond to the four @xmath30 sites of the unit cell .",
    "we have respectively denoted the nearest and next nearest neighbors by @xmath34 and @xmath35 . within the same unit cell , the exchange couplings between the nearest and next nearest neighbor iron sites",
    "are respectively denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 . between the neighboring unit cells , the couplings between the nearest and next nearest neighbor iron sites are respectively @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in order to incorporate the modulations of the exchange couplings by the vacancy order",
    ", we will allow the exchange couplings to take both antiferromagnetic ( @xmath38 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath39 ) signs .",
    "[ fig:1 ]      to determine the phase diagram of the extended @xmath40-@xmath41 model defined by eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , we apply classical monte carlo technique .",
    "we treat the spins as classical @xmath42 vectors , and adapt the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "the monte carlo simulations have been performed on finite lattices with linear dimension up to @xmath43 , and at temperatures as low as @xmath44 . by checking both the static spin structure factor and the monte carlo snapshots of spins in real space",
    ", we identify the ordering wave vectors and corresponding real - space spin pattern of various phases stabilized at low temperatures .",
    "we have found seven possible magnetic phases .",
    "one of these is an incommensurate magnetic phase ( no higher order commensuration ) , with very broad structure factor in the entire ebz , sbz and mbz1 .",
    "this phase occupies a small sliver of the parameter space in the phase diagram and will not be discussed in detail . in the magnetic phase diagram we denote this incommensurate phase as ic .",
    "the other six magnetically ordered phases have commensurate ordering vectors in the mbz1 .",
    "these phases are denoted as af1 , af2 , af3 , af4 , af5 and fm in the following discussions , and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2a ] through fig .",
    "[ fig:2f ] .",
    "the af1 phase corresponds to the experimentally relevant block - spin antiferromagnetic state .",

    "2 can be described by the following single - mode spiral : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the position vector in the 8-site unit cell , and the ordering wave vector in the mbz1 .",
    "the canting angle at site @xmath48 is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the fact that these six states are the lowest energy states , has also been confirmed by minimizing the ground - state energy with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the magnetic phase diagram of an extended @xmath2 model on several modulated square lattices . for a @xmath3-depleted square lattice with @xmath0 vacancy order",
    "we have shown that a block - spin antiferromagnetic state , of the type observed in @xmath24 , arises over a significant region of the phase diagram .",
    "this region comprises three parts : a ) all the intra - block exchange couplings ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) and inter - block couplings ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) are antiferromagnetic ; b ) @xmath13 , @xmath36,@xmath37 are antiferromagnetic , while @xmath12 is ferromagnetic ; c ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 are antiferromagnetic , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are ferromagnetic .",
