    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) in globular clusters ( gcs ) represents the helium core burning phase of stellar evolution .",
    "hb morphology varies from cluster to cluster ; some clusters show a red hb ( rhb ) , others a blue hb ( bhb ) , and some even a bimodal hb with both a rhb and bhb . some bhbs exhibit a long , vertically extended tail in optical colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , which is formed by particularly hot objects .",
    "bhb stars hotter than @xmath0 k are usually referred to as extreme hb ( ehb ) stars and are thought to have undergone severe mass loss during their rgb phase ( e.g. momany et al .",
    "they evolve into agb manqu stars or post - early agb stars , but do not return to the agb ( e.g. dorman et al .",
    "in a few gcs , the hottest  and optically faintest ",
    "end of the ehb at @xmath1 k is populated by a peculiar class of objects which was first detected in @xmath2 cen and ngc2808 .",
    "they form a blue hook ( bhk ) at the hot end of the hb in far - uv ( fuv ) cmds and were consequently called `` blue hook stars '' ( whitney et al .  1998 ,",
    "dcruz et al .",
    "2000 , brown et al .",
    "2001 ) .    the physical mechanism that produces bhk populations is still uncertain .",
    "at least two scenarios have been proposed .    in the _",
    "late he flasher scenario _ these stars are explained as a consequence of extreme mass - loss during the rgb phase and late he - flashing while descending the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling sequence ( e.g.  brown et al .",
    "2001 ) . due to the thin residual h - envelope",
    ", he is mixed into the envelope and h is mixed into the core during the late he - flash . as a result , the stars are hotter and uv - fainter than canonical ehb stars .",
    "by contrast , in the _ he self - enrichment scenario _ the ehb and bhk stars are produced via the normal evolution of he - enriched sub - populations in gcs .",
    "for example , lee et al .  (",
    "2005 ) were able to explain the peculiar hb morphology and the presence of bhk stars in ngc2808 and @xmath2 cen with several he - enhanced sub - populations within these clusters .",
    "these sub - populations might have formed from the ejecta of intermediate - mass agb stars of the first generation of stars ( see also dantona et al .",
    "for the same age and metallicity , he - enriched hb stars have smaller masses than normal hb stars , resulting in bluer zahb locations ( lee et al .",
    "they are also brighter in the fuv , but this effect is reversed for very hot he - enriched hb stars with @xmath3 k. lee et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also predicted a narrow split in ngc2808 s main sequence ( ms ) , which was indeed found by dantona et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and piotto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "one way to make progress in understanding the nature of bhk stars and their progenitors is to test if the presence of bhk populations is associated with particular cluster properties .",
    "for example , if he - enriched populations are needed to produce bhk stars , these stars would then only be expected in gcs that exceed some critical mass threshold needed to keep the stellar ejecta from the first generation of stars within the cluster potential . alternatively",
    ", if he enrichment is not important in the production of bhk stars , the mass loss required by the late - he flash could be due to dynamical processes , such as binary interactions . in this case",
    ", one might expect that only clusters with high encounter rates host bhk populations .    in order to address these questions ,",
    "we have constructed a sample of gcs in which the presence or absence of bhk populations can be established with a high degree of confidence .",
    "more specifically , since bhk stars can ( only ) be easily recognized in uv cmds , we restrict our sample to gcs for which sufficiently deep ( spacebased ) fuv or near - uv ( nuv ) observations are available . using this sample",
    ", we are able to search for any correlations between the existence of bhk populations and the properties of their host clusters ( e.g. metallicity , mass , relaxation times etc . ) .",
    "our results do confirm suggestions in the literature that bhk stars are preferentially found in massive clusters ( e.g.  rosenberg et al .",
    "2004 , rood et al .",
    "however , we also show that this preference may actually just be a selection effect , associated with the fact that bhk stars are intrinsically rare and thus can only be found in sufficiently large samples of stars .",
    ", @xmath4 ) , agb manqu stars in red ( @xmath5 ) , bhk candidates in magenta ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and bhk progeny stars in violet ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) . ehb and bhk stars and their progeny that have an optical counterpart are marked in a darker shade .",
    "right : optical cmd of ngc2808 ( data taken from piotto et al .",
    "counterparts to fuv sources are marked with the same colour as in the left cmd .",
    "[ cmd2808],width=328,height=215 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  2 shows that only very few statistically significant correlations exist between the occurrence of bhk stars and the parameters of the clusters . as can be seen , the most significant difference between bhk and non - bhk clusters is associated with their mass distributions .",
    "more specifically , the ks test indicates at greater than 99% confidence that ( high ) mass is associated with the presence of bhk stars in a cluster . in fig .",
    "[ mass ] we plot the mass distribution and the cumulative mass distribution for the bhk clusters ( blue line ) , all clusters in our sample ( red line ) , and all clusters from the harris ( 1996 ) catalogue . as can be seen , all clusters in which bhk candidates have been found are amongst the most massive in the galaxy .",
    "the apparent preference for bhk populations to be found in abnormally massive clusters has been remarked upon before in the literature ( see e.g. rosenberg et al .",
    "2004 , mhler et al .",
    "2004 , rood et al .",
    "2008 ) . at first sight",
    ", this result would seem to support the self - enrichment scenario for bhk star production .",
    "however , although bhk stars appear to be found more frequently in massive star clusters , this does not reveal much about their origin .",
    "in particular , there is an obvious selection bias resulting from the fact that massive clusters contain more stars . since studies of massive clusters thus typically also inspect more stars , such studies are more likely to turn up intrinsically rare populations , such as bhk stars .",
    "if , for example , only 1 in every 100,000 stars becomes a bhk object , individual low - mass clusters will not contain any bhk populations , even if there is no physical lower mass limit associated with bhk production .",
    "the way to test for the existence of a critical mass limit in this type of analysis is to consider the location of bhk clusters in the sorted , _ cumulative _ mass distribution of the parent sample .",
    "if there is no critical mass limit , bhk clusters should be uniformly distributed within this cumulative mass distribution .",
    "if there is a mass limit , they should be significantly concentrated at the high mass end . by doing so",
    ", we are effectively combining many low - mass clusters to form aggregate high - mass clusters .",
    ", width=328,height=52 ]    in fig .",
    "[ uniform ] we plot the positions of the bhk clusters within the cumulative mass distribution of the available parent sample . using a ks test",
    ", we then checked whether the positions of the bhk clusters is different from a uniform distribution .",
    "the returned probability that the bhk clusters are randomly selected from the parent population is 36.9% .",
    "this is not statistically significant at even the @xmath10 level of confidence .",
    "thus , the available sample does _ not _ provide evidence for a lower mass limit for clusters capable of producing bhk stars .",
    "our main result is that bhk populations have so far been detected only in the most massive gcs , but this does not ( yet ) imply that low - mass clusters can not form bhk stars .",
    "in particular , we can not rule out that the apparent preference for massive gcs arises simply because these clusters contain more stars .",
    "however , regardless of whether the sizes of bhk populations simply scale with total cluster mass or whether a lower - mass cut - off for clusters capable of producing bhk stars exists , cluster mass is clearly a key parameter .",
    "that said , it is puzzling that there _ are _ gcs as massive as the bhk clusters that do _ not _ harbour a population of bhk stars . for example , 47tuc is also one of the most massive clusters , but does not contain any bhk stars ( or bhb or ehb stars ) . similarly , ngc6441 , an hb twin to ngc6388 and more massive than ngc2808 , also does not show a population of bhk stars .",
    "therefore mass can not be the only parameter that is associated with the production of bhk stars .    other parameters for which the ks test suggested marginally significant differences between the bhk and the non - bhk clusters are the concentration parameter , the core and halfmass radius , the core and halfmass relaxation time , and the halfmass escape velocity .",
    "it is difficult to know whether these secondary correlations are physical , since most of the relevant cluster parameters also correlate with total cluster mass within our parent sample .",
    "if one is nevertheless willing to take these secondary correlations at face value , they might indicate that binarity may be a key ingredient in bhk star formation . more specifically",
    ", the long relaxation times , large core radii , small concentration parameters and large escape velocities of the bhk clusters might indicate that cluster core collapse was / is decelerated or prevented , most likely by the presence of binaries ( e.g.  elson et al .",
    "1987 , hut et al .",
    "1992 , fregeau 2008 ) .",
    "although ehb stars seem to be rarely found in binaries ( e.g. moni bidin et al .",
    "2008 ) they still might have formed in binary systems and could be the result of binary evolution , much like their field counterparts , the subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars ( e.g. han et al .",
    "2007 ) . binary interaction might then enhance mass - loss during the rgb phase of a star , finally leading to the evolution into a late he - flasher / bhk star ( e.g. bailyn et al . 1992 ) .",
    "on the other hand , short relaxation times might imply that the hardening of binaries through binary interactions ( heggie 1975 ) occurs so rapidly that all of the stellar envelope is stripped while the star is still on the rgb , leaving behind a he wd rather than an ehb or bhk star .",
    "interestingly , most bhk clusters show multiple stellar populations ( @xmath2 cen , ngc2808 , m54 ) and/or unusual and tilted hbs ( ngc6388 ) that indicate he self - enrichment ( see e.g.  lee et al .  1999 ,",
    "bedin et al .",
    "2004 , dantona et al .",
    "2005 , piotto et al .",
    "2005 , siegel et al .",
    "2007 , piotto et al .  2007 ) .",
    "this may be linked to the high masses of the bhk clusters , as only clusters massive enough should be able to retain the ejecta of their agb stars .",
    "however , so far no evidence for multiple , he - enriched stellar populations has been found in ngc2419 ( sandquist & hess 2008 ) .",
    "the primary result of our analysis is that from the available data one can not conclude that a low mass cutoff to bhk populations exists . however , absence of evidence does not constitute evidence of absence .",
    "such a low - mass cut - off may exist , and given that 4 of the 5 bhk clusters are the most massive in our sample , the bhk sub - sample could hardly be more biased towards high mass than it is .",
    "thus the real problem is that the available sample is too small , and too deficient in lower mass clusters , to permit a more definitive test of the critical mass hypothesis .",
    "the available sample is itself strongly biased towards massive clusters ( see the comparison of the parent sample to the total galactic population in table  2 ) , but a larger more unbiased sample does not exist today .",
    "this is because massive clusters usually make more promising observational targets , for a variety of technical and physical reasons .",
    "however , this type of selection bias severely limits our ability to carry out sufficiently powerful statistical tests .",
    "bhk stars seem to be a rare phenomenon that occurs in only a few gcs .",
    "we have constructed a carefully selected parent sample of gcs in which the presence or absence of bhk populations can be established with confidence .",
    "bhk stars have so far been found in only the most massive gcs .",
    "however , we also find that this does not ( yet ) imply the existence of a lower limit on the mass of a cluster capable of producing bhk stars . instead",
    ", the preference for massive clusters could just be a selection effect , associated with the fact that bhk stars are intrinsically rare and thus it is more likely to observe these stars in high mass clusters rather than low mass clusters . in order to resolve this issue",
    ", we need additional data on many more low - mass clusters .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to make progress by studying how the _ numbers _ of bhk stars scale with cluster properties .",
    "however , given the non - uniformity of the existing dataset , we can only estimate lower limits based on the published data ( see table  1 ) . in any case , the identification of _ high _ cluster mass as a necessary ingredient for the production of bhk populations appears to be premature .",
    "we also note that not _ all _ massive clusters , or all clusters with multiple populations , also contain bhk stars .",
    "counter examples are the massive gcs 47tuc and ngc6441 . on the other hand",
    ", ngc2419 contains bhk stars , but apparently no multiple populations ( see sandquist & hess , 2008 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that mass might be the main , but not the only parameter relevant to establishing bhk populations in gcs . with this in mind",
    ", we have sketched a scenario for bhk formation involving dynamical interactions between binary systems that would also be consistent with the fact that bhk clusters tend to have long relaxation times , large core radii , and large escape velocities .",
