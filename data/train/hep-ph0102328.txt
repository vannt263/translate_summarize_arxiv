    "presently , the basic spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor hadro- , photo- and electroproduction are known exactly up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "two main results of the exact pqcd calculations can be formulated as follows .",
    "first , the nlo corrections are large ; they increase the leading order ( lo ) predictions for both charm and bottom production cross sections approximately by a factor of 2 . for this reason",
    ", one could expect that the higher order corrections as well as the nonperturbative contributions can be essential in these processes , especially for the @xmath6-quark case .",
    "second , the fixed order predictions are very sensitive to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters .",
    "in fact , the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy quark mass , @xmath1 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , @xmath7 and the parton distribution functions are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the nlo predictions for total cross sections @xcite . for this reason , it is very difficult to compare directly , without additional assumptions , the fixed order predictions for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data and thereby to test the pqcd applicability to the heavy quark production .",
    "since the spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor production are not well defined quantitatively in pqcd it is of special interest to study those spin - dependent observables which are stable under variations of input parameters of the theory @xcite . in this report",
    "we analyze the charm and bottom production by linearly polarized photons , namely the reactions @xmath8 we consider the single spin asymmetry parameter , @xmath9 , which measures the parallel - perpendicular asymmetry in the quark azimuthal distribution : @xmath10 here d@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the degree of linear polarization of the incident photon beam , @xmath13 is the centre of mass energy of the process ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath14 is the angle between the beam polarization direction and the observed quark transverse momentum .",
    "the properties of the single spin asymmetry at born level as well as the contributions of nonperturbative effects ( such as the gluon transverse motion in the target and the heavy quark fragmentation ) have been considered in @xcite . using the methods of refs.@xcite for the threshold resummation of soft gluons , we have also calculated the next - to - leading order corrections to @xmath9 at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) level @xcite .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be formulated as follows :    * at fixed target energies , the lo predictions for azimuthal asymmetry ( [ 2 ] ) are not small and can be tested experimentally .",
    "for instance , @xmath15 * radiative corrections practically do not affect the born predictions for @xmath9 at fixed target energies .",
    "* at energies sufficiently above the production threshold , both leading and next - to - leading order predictions for @xmath9 are insensitive ( to within few percent ) to uncertainties in the qcd parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath7 and in the gluon distribution function .",
    "this implies that theoretical uncertainties in the spin - dependent and spin - averaged cross sections ( the numerator and denominator of the fraction ( [ 2 ] ) , respectively ) cancel each other with a good accuracy . * nonperturbative corrections to the @xmath17-quark azimuthal asymmetry @xmath9 due to the gluon transverse motion in the target",
    "are negligible .",
    "because of the smallness of the @xmath18-quark mass , the @xmath19-kick corrections to @xmath9 in the charm case are larger ; they are of order of 20% .",
    "we conclude that the single spin asymmetry is an observable quantitatively well defined , rapidly convergent in pqcd and insensitive to nonperturbative contributions .",
    "measurements of asymmetry parameters would provide a good test of the fixed order qcd applicability to heavy flavor production .",
    "at leading order , @xmath20 , the only partonic subprocess which is responsible for heavy quark photoproduction is the two - body photon - gluon fusion : @xmath21 the cross section corresponding to the born diagrams is @xcite : @xmath22 ,   \\label{4}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the degree of the photon beam polarization ; @xmath23 is the angle between the observed quark transverse momentum , @xmath24 , and the beam polarization direction . in ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath25 is the color factor , @xmath26tr@xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the quark charge in units of electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "we use the following definition of partonic kinematical variables : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the heavy quark mass .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the cteq5 @xcite parametrization of the gluon distribution function is used .",
    "the default values of the charm and bottom mass are @xmath31 1.5 gev and @xmath32 4.75 gev ; @xmath33 300 mev and @xmath34 200 mev .",
    "the default values of the factorization scale @xmath16 chosen for the @xmath9 asymmetry calculation are @xmath35 for the case of charm production and @xmath36 for the bottom case @xcite . for the renormalization scale , @xmath2",
    ", we use @xmath37 .",
    "let us discuss the pqcd predictions for the asymmetry parameter defined by ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "our calculations of @xmath9 at lo for the @xmath18- and @xmath17-quark are presented by solid lines in fig.1 .",
    "one can see that at energies sufficiently above the production threshold the single spin asymmetry @xmath38 depends weekly on @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     one can see from fig.2 that the nlo nll and born predictions for @xmath9 coincide with each other with accuracy better than 2% .",
    "we have verified that the azimuthal asymmetry is independent ( to within few percent ) of theoretical uncertainties in the qcd input parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) at nlo too .",
    "our analysis shows that the nlo corrections practically do not affect the born predictions for the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor production by linearly polarized photons at fixed target energies .",
    "so , the quantity @xmath9 is an observable quantitatively well defined , rapidly convergent and insensitive to nonperturbative contributions .",
    "measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry in bottom production would be a good test of the conventional parton model based on pqcd .",
