    "<S> the behavior of the engine depends decisively on the relationship between heating time @xmath5 and quantum time @xmath66 , that is , on the one hand , on the internal dynamics of the machine , as dictated by thermodynamics , and , on the other hand , on the decoherence process induced by the coupling to the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the otto motor is nonclassical only if the quantum time is larger than the heating time , @xmath75 , so that the lgi may be violated . as seen from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , the heating time @xmath5 depends on the two temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath9 and on the internal friction coefficient @xmath24 ; we will use in the following the reduced quantity @xmath76 .     and @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> our main results are summarized in the phase diagram shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , we identify three distinct regimes : i ) @xmath78 : for @xmath67 smaller than a critical value @xmath79 , the behavior of the engine is quantum for temperatures @xmath80 ; owing to the almost vertical shape of @xmath66 , the threshold temperature @xmath81 is mostly independent of @xmath67 in that domain ; ii ) @xmath82 : for intermediate values of @xmath67 , the engine appears quantum in some temperature intervals and classical in some others . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a transition regime where the boundary between classical and quantum worlds is blurry ; iii ) @xmath83 : for @xmath67 larger than a second critical value @xmath84 , the dynamics of the otto engine is classical for all temperatures @xmath4 . note that the tendency of @xmath5 to diverge for larger values of @xmath67 is clearly visible in the upper left corner of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> 3 reveals some subtle interplay between thermodynamics and quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> we first remark that in the low @xmath67 phase , the threshold temperature @xmath81 is equivalent to the condition @xmath60 for a two - level system coupled to a single reservoir at temperature @xmath85 . here </S>",
    "<S> the internal dynamics of the engine which is set by thermodynamics does not play any role , and the quantumness of the otto cycle is solely controlled by the decoherence process generated by the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the situation changes dramatically in the two other phases as the heating time @xmath5 increases significantly with increasing @xmath67 . in the high @xmath67 regime , thermodynamics thus imposes a purely classical behavior , although decoherence alone would predict the existence of a quantum sector for low enough temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the classical or quantum nature of the engine is not just governed by the coupling to the reservoirs . a second , nonintuitive </S>",
    "<S> , observation is that trying to operate the engine faster in order to keep it coherent is bound to fail : shortening the compression / expansion steps indeed results in increased nonadiabatic excitations induced by a finite @xmath67 @xcite , and , in turn , to longer thermalization times . </S>",
    "<S> the latter eventually lead to stronger decoherence and , consequently , to incoherent dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the rule the faster , the better which might be true for most quantum applications , hence does not apply to quantum heat engines .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 finally presents the influence of the cold reservoir temperature @xmath9 ( for fixed @xmath67 ) on the quantumness of the otto engine . </S>",
    "<S> we note that it is largely similar to that of the internal friction @xmath86 displayed in fig .  3 , as both parameters have an equivalent role in exciting the system . for @xmath9 below the critical value @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> , it does not affect the behavior of the engine which is controlled by the same threshold temperature @xmath81 given above ( the discussion in the previous section was based in this @xmath9 regime ) . in an intermediate domain </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics of the engine alternates between quantum and classical as @xmath4 is increased . ultimately , for @xmath9 larger that the critical value @xmath88 , the lgi is never violated and the engine is purely classical .    _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have used the leggett - garg inequality to completely characterize the quantum properties of a two - level otto engine . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a phase diagram that allows to identify the parameter regimes where the engine behaves nonclassically , and where , therefore , quantum resources in the form of coherence or correlations , might be successfully exploited . </S>",
    "<S> we have further shown that trying to run a thermal machine faster , with the hope of beating decoherence , is not a winning strategy , as thermodynamics will make the dynamics classical .    _ acknowledgments . _ </S>",
