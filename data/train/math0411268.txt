    "a _ multary quasigroup _ is a set @xmath2 with a multary operation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , such that the equation @xmath5 is uniquely solvable for any one variable @xmath6 given the values of the remaining variables .",
    "multary quasigroups were introduced by belousov and sandik @xcite . a _ dowling geometry of a group _ ,",
    "@xmath7 , is a certain matroid of rank @xmath8 associated with a group @xmath9 ; it was invented by dowling @xcite and shown by kahn and kung @xcite to have a central role in matroid theory .",
    "these two structures are both equivalent to particular kinds of the same general object , something i call a _ biased expansion graph_. associativity in multary quasigroups , and quasigroup generalizations of dowling geometries , both depend on and can be analyzed through the structure of biased expansions .",
    "the customary view of the associative law is that it describes a relationship between two different ways of carrying out a binary operation on three arguments : @xmath10 we look at it differently : we regard associativity as a property of factorizability or reducibility of a multary product .",
    "for instance , letting @xmath11 denote a ternary or binary product , we think of ordinary associativity as the combination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 the two factorizations and constitute associativity in the usual sense ( if all the binary multiplications are the same ) , but to us this is a secondary phenomenon .",
    "we are more interested in association as factorization .",
    "our approach is based on representing the product by a kind of graph called a biased expansion ; it treats multary operations but only of a certain kind : the equation @xmath14 must be uniquely solvable for any variable given all the others .",
    "sets with such operations , which were introduced by belousov and sandik @xcite , are known as _",
    "multary _ or _ polyadic _ _ quasigroups_.-ary '' , where @xmath0 is left unspecified , which is unsatisfactory . since `` polyadic '' has not become popular , i propose `` multary '' as a generic adjective .",
    "one occasionally sees `` multiary '' , but etymologically this seems less correct . we should mention that ternary quasigroups had previously been defined by rado @xcite .",
    "] we are investigating associativity in multary quasigroups by means of biased expansion graphs .    formally , a _",
    "multary quasigroup _",
    "( of _ type _ or",
    "@xmath15 ) is a set @xmath2 with a multary operation @xmath16 such that the equation @xmath17 is uniquely solvable for any one @xmath6 if the other @xmath15 @xmath18 s are given .",
    "( we assume @xmath19 , except that infinite arity is allowed in section [ group ] . )",
    "our generalized associativity is ( consecutive ) factorization of @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are multary quasigroups of suitable arity .",
    "such a factorization is sometimes called an _ @xmath25-reduction _ of @xmath20 . as an associativity property",
    "we call it _ reductive associativity_. one of our main results ( theorem [ t:3connq ] ) is that , if the graph of factorizations of @xmath20 is 3-connected , @xmath20 is essentially an _ iterated group _ : a multary quasigroup whose operation has the form @xmath26 computed in a group .",
    "( that was known in the case that the graph is complete ; see section [ group ] . )",
    "this is one of the two extreme kinds of multary quasigroup . at the other extreme",
    "is an _ irreducible _ multary quasigroup , whose operation has no factorizations at all .",
    "( any binary quasigroup is irreducible .",
    "it is an iterated group just when it is a group . )    by `` essentially ''",
    "we mean up to _ isotopy_. multary operations @xmath27 and @xmath28 are called _ isotopic _ if there exist bijections @xmath29 such that @xmath30 from our graph - theoretic standpoint we can not distinguish isotopic operations .",
    "nor can we distinguish between operations that are circularly parastrophic , where _ circular parastrophy _",
    "means circular permutation of the @xmath31 variables , i.e. , replacing the operation @xmath32 by any operation @xmath23 defined by @xmath33 or @xmath34 @xmath35 for some @xmath36 , where the subscripts are taken modulo @xmath31 .",
    "( this must not be confused with arbitrary permutation of the operands , which is _",
    "general parastrophy_. ) since there is no name for the combination of isotopy and circular parastrophy , we shall call it _",
    "circular allotopy _ : multary operations are _ circularly allotopic _ if one can be obtained from the other by a combination of isotopy and circular parastrophy .",
    "we reiterate : our method does not distinguish multary quasigroups that are circularly allotopic .",
    "belousov treated equation as representing a binary operation on functions , written @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting algebra led to many theorems .",
    "a simple example is the property belousov called _ @xmath38-associativity _ : @xmath39 belousov solved this equation in @xcite by axiomatizing the algebra of multary quasigroups with composition operations @xmath40 .",
    "( see corollary [ c : qfactor ] . )",
    "however , he left outstanding an important question : whether , whenever the factorization graph of a multary quasigroup is 3-connected , the operation is isotopic to an iterated group operation .",
    "we prove this , as well as reproducing the solution of , as corollaries of our structure theorem for biased expansions .",
    "another problem left incomplete by belousov is that of small multary quasigroups .",
    "if the order @xmath41 is very small , @xmath2 may have no room to fail to factor , i.e. , to be other than an iterated group isotope .",
    "for example , it is well known that a binary quasigroup of order at most 4 is a group isotope . according to information provided by dudek @xcite ,",
    "belousov and collaborator(s ) proved that @xmath2 of any arity is isotopic to an iterated group when @xmath42 and stated that the same holds true when @xmath43 but that their proof of the latter was too long to be published .",
    "these facts are a simple consequence of our second main criterion for a multary quasigroup to be an iterated group isotope . a multary quasigroup obtained by fixing the values of some set of independent variables in @xmath2",
    "is called a _",
    "residual _ multary quasigroup of @xmath2 .",
    "we show in section [ 4minors ] , as interpreted in theorem [ t : qinduced3 ] , that @xmath2 is isotopic to an iterated group if its arity is at least three and every residual ternary quasigroup is an iterated group isotope .",
    "the traditional multary generalization of associativity , due to drnte @xcite and extensively studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is a stronger form of @xmath38-associativity , is a special case of our general picture . a @xmath15-ary operation @xmath16 is called _ associative _ if it satisfies all the @xmath15 identities @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is defined by any one of the identities .",
    "( that is , consists of @xmath47 identities and one definition . )",
    "we might call this _ substitutive associativity _ by way of contrast with reductive associativity .",
    "a multary quasigroup with substitutive associativity for all @xmath36 is called a _ @xmath15-group _ ( or _ multary _ or _ polyadic group _ ) , a @xmath48-group being an ordinary group .",
    "evidently , @xmath46 is an example of a multary quasigroup operation that is reducible in a multiplicity of ways . by our general theorem",
    "just mentioned , @xmath20 is isotopic to an iterated group .",
    "hossz @xcite and gluskin @xcite have a far more complete result : an explicit construction of all multary groups in terms of groups , which was later much generalized .",
    "it should be possible to supplement our method so as to obtain their theorem , but we do not explore that question here .",
    "biased expansions of circles are cryptomorphic to circular allotopy classes of multary quasigroups . but first we must define biased expansions .    a _ biased graph _ @xmath49 consists of a graph @xmath50 , which may be finite or infinite , and a _ linear class _ @xmath51 of circles ( circuits , cycles ) of @xmath50 , meaning that in each theta subgraph the number of circles that belong to @xmath51 is different from two .",
    "the circles in @xmath51 are called the _ balanced circles _ of @xmath52 .    a _ biased expansion _ of a graph",
    "@xmath53 is a biased graph @xmath52 together with a _ projection _ mapping @xmath54 that is surjective , is the identity on nodes , maps no balanced digon to a single edge , and has the _ circle lifting property _ : for each circle @xmath55 in @xmath53 and each @xmath56 , ",
    ", @xmath57 , there is a unique @xmath58 for which @xmath59 is balanced .",
    "in addition , no edge fiber @xmath60 may contain a balanced digon ; but this is implied by the other properties if @xmath61 is not an isthmus .",
    "one can think of @xmath52 as a kind of branched covering of @xmath53 .",
    "we write @xmath62 to mean that @xmath52 is a biased expansion of @xmath53 with projection @xmath63 ; though usually we omit @xmath63 from the notation .",
    "we call @xmath52 a _ regular _ or",
    "_ @xmath64-fold _ biased expansion if each @xmath60 has the same cardinality @xmath64 ; then @xmath64 is the _ multiplicity _ of the expansion .",
    "@xmath65 denotes a @xmath64-fold biased expansion of @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , a biased expansion of an inseparable graph must be regular .",
    "a biased expansion is _ trivial _ if it is regular with multiplicity @xmath66 . in defining a biased expansion of a circle",
    "it is not necessary to require @xmath52 to be a biased graph ; that follows from the rest of the definition because a theta graph exists only by containing a digon .",
    "a simple kind of biased expansion is a _ group expansion _",
    "* example i.6.7 ) .",
    "the expansion of a graph @xmath53 by a group @xmath9 , in brief the _ @xmath9-expansion _ of @xmath53 , is the gain graph , denoted by @xmath67 , whose node set is @xmath68 and whose edge set is @xmath69 , the endpoints of an edge @xmath70 ( this is shorthand for @xmath71 ) being the same as those of @xmath61 .",
    "the projection @xmath72 maps @xmath70 to @xmath61 .",
    "we associate with @xmath70 the group element @xmath23 , called the _",
    "gain _ of @xmath70 ; in order to define gains in a technically correct manner we orient @xmath53 arbitrarily and orient @xmath70 similarly to @xmath61 , so the gain of @xmath70 in the chosen direction is @xmath23 and in the opposite direction @xmath73 .",
    "a circle in @xmath67 is balanced if the product of the gains of its edges , taken in a consistent direction around the circle , equals @xmath66 , the group identity .",
    "this defines a biased graph , which we write @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath53 is simple with @xmath0 nodes , then @xmath67 is contained in @xmath75 ; thus group expansions of complete graphs are basic .",
    "a very different kind of biased expansion is the expansion of a circle @xmath76 of length @xmath31 by a @xmath15-ary quasigroup @xmath2 . in the _ quasigroup expansion _",
    "@xmath77 , the nodes are @xmath78 .",
    "there is an edge @xmath79 for every @xmath80 and @xmath81 as well as an edge @xmath82 .",
    "the balanced circles are the circles @xmath83 such that @xmath84 in @xmath2 .",
    "a quasigroup expansion need not be contained in an expansion of a complete graph ; see theorem [ l : q ] .",
    "conversely , from a biased expansion @xmath85 we obtain a circular allotopy class of @xmath15-ary quasigroups .",
    "let @xmath76 have nodes @xmath86 and edges @xmath87 .",
    "set @xmath88 and fix bijections @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath2 is a set that will be the set of elements of the @xmath15-ary quasigroup .",
    "the multary operation is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the unique edge in @xmath94 that forms a balanced circle with @xmath95 .",
    "the arbitrary choice of the bijections is what makes @xmath2 defined only up to isotopy .",
    "the arbitrariness of the distinguished edge @xmath96 and the direction of reading the circle is what leaves @xmath2 well defined only up to circular parastrophy .",
    "thus we have the first two parts of proposition [ p : qgroup ] .",
    "the third part is proved at theorem [ l : q ] .",
    "we say @xmath77 _ extends _ to @xmath97 if there is a biased expansion @xmath98 such that @xmath99 .",
    "( section [ extension ] has a fuller treatment . )",
    "[ p : qgroup ] a @xmath15-ary quasigroup expansion @xmath77 is a biased expansion of @xmath76 .",
    "conversely , every biased expansion of @xmath76 has the form @xmath77 for a @xmath15-ary quasigroup @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , two @xmath15-ary quasigroup expansions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are isomorphic if and only if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are circularly allotopic .",
    "moreover , @xmath77 extends to a chord @xmath97 of @xmath76 if and only if the operation @xmath20 of @xmath2 factors as in .",
    "taking @xmath104 , we see that biased expansions of a triangle are ( as dowling knew implicitly ; see @xcite ) graph - theoretic realizations of circular allotopy classes of binary quasigroups and , therefore , of latin squares and 3-nets .",

    "defined up to isotopy and parastrophy .",
    "as far as i know , no analog of the quadrangle criterion has been formulated for such objects and therefore for biased expansions of larger graphs such as @xmath76 for @xmath115 .    in a sense indicated by proposition [ p : qgroup ] ,",
    "biased expansion graphs are a graphical generalization of groups and multary quasigroups .",
    "that they truly are a generalization is shown by the fact that a biased expansion need not have a hamiltonian circle .",
    "if the base graph is hamiltonian , then we have a multary operation  which in general depends on the choice of hamiltonian circle  from proposition [ p : qgroup ] , but if it is not , then we have something that , from an algebraic standpoint , is more complicated ; it might be thought of as a combinatorial complex of multary quasigroups .",
    "if biased expansion graphs generalize groups , it is natural to ask how far a given biased expansion is from being a group .",
    "biased expansions of complete graphs are group expansions , essentially because @xmath116 , as the base of a biased expansion , encodes the associative law ( see section [ group ] ) . thus , a more precise version of the question is : how far is the base graph from being complete ? but this is still not quite right , because it might be possible to extend the expansion to new edges between nonadjacent nodes .",
    "if the expansion extends to a complete graph , then it is contained in a group expansion so it itself is a group expansion and any corresponding multary quasigroup is an iterated group isotope . in general , there is always a maximal extension of the given biased expansion graph , that has the most pairs of adjacent nodes ( see section [ extension ] ) ; it is of this extended expansion that we should ask the refined question , and indeed it makes sense to think of the number of nonadjacent node pairs in the base graph as a measure of how much a biased expansion fails to represent a group .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that nongroup expansions of large incomplete graphs , and in particular irreducible multary quasigroups , exist at all .",
    "however , all examples are 2-separable , for , as we prove in sections [ extension ] and [ group ] , every biased expansion of a 3-connected simple graph having more than three nodes is a group expansion . from this and other work",
    "we can deduce the complete structure of a biased expansion ( section [ bx ] ) and answer the question raised in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example iii.3.8 ) of exactly which graphs have a nongroup biased expansion ( corollary [ c : basenongroup ] ) .",
    "biased expansion graphs were inspired by dowling s matroids of a group  though no matroids were used in the preparation of this article .",
    "one way to construct the rank-@xmath0 dowling matroid ( or `` geometry '' ) @xmath7 of a group @xmath9 is to take the group expansion @xmath75 , adjoin a half edge to each node , and take the bias matroid ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii.2 ) .",
    "i sketch this construction ( from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example iii.5.7 or part v ) ) to suggest how biased expansions of simple graphs , especially those that are maximal on the given node set , are a natural generalization of dowling geometries .",
    "the unexplained terms can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part iii or v ) .    given any biased expansion @xmath117 ,",
    "one can add an unbalanced loop at each node and take the bias matroid ; call this matroid @xmath118 .",
    "the operator @xmath119 , applied to maximal biased expansions , generalizes the construction of dowling geometries .",
    "the dowling geometries are the only examples derived from groups because the only maximal group expansions are those of the complete graphs @xmath120 . given that nongroup biased expansions exist , one asks what other matroids can be obtained from maximal biased expansions ; they are natural candidates for generalized dowling geometries .",
    "that question motivated this work .",
    "we will see ( via theorem [ l : q ] ) that an expansion @xmath121 of @xmath122 by an irreducible @xmath0-ary quasigroup @xmath2 is maximal , since it can have no chords ; thus these are part of the answer . the question is completely answered if we can classify all maximal biased expansions .",
    "that is our theorem [ t : structuremax]the solution of a problem that had puzzled me since 1976 .",
    "a final way to look upon a multary quasigroup , or a biased expansion of a circle , is as a kind of transversal design .",
    "transversal @xmath123-design _ consists of a set of points partitioned into @xmath124 _",
    "point classes _ @xmath125 ( usually called `` groups '' , but they have nothing to do with algebra ) of @xmath15 points each , and a class of _ blocks _ , which are subsets of points satisfying    1 .   no two points in a class are contained in a common block , and 2 .",
    "any @xmath123 points , no two in a class together , are contained in exactly @xmath126 common blocks ,    where @xmath126 , the _ index _ , is a fixed positive integer . as @xmath123 is called the _ strength _ , we refer to an @xmath127-design as having _",
    "high strength_. a @xmath15-fold biased expansion @xmath52 of @xmath128 is equivalent to a transversal design @xmath129 of high strength with @xmath130 .",
    "the points of @xmath129 are the edges of @xmath52 , the class @xmath125 consists of all edges with endpoints @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and the blocks are the balanced circles .",
    "a group expansion thus generates a design based on the group .",
    "the construction of the design is easy to describe directly .",
    "the classes are copies of the group and a block is any set @xmath133 , composed of one element of each class @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 . here we need to assume the classes are ordered ; we let the first class be @xmath136 , the second @xmath137 , etc .",
    "the analog of factorization is consecutive composition : supposing @xmath138 and @xmath139 are two transversal designs of high strength with index 1 , we form their _ @xmath36-composition _ @xmath129 by identifying @xmath140 with @xmath141 and then defining the classes of @xmath129 to be those of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , with the exception of @xmath140 ( @xmath142 ) , and the blocks to be the sets of the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are overlapping blocks of @xmath138 and @xmath139 . the inverse operation to @xmath36-composition is _",
    "@xmath36-decomposition_. the analog of the factorization graph is defined by the existence of @xmath36-decompositions of @xmath129 .",
