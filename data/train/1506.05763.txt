    "the first - order liquid - gas phase transition is a well known phenomenon that takes place in atomic and/or molecular systems , in the system of interacting nucleons ( nuclear matter ) , and most probably between hadrons and quark - gluon plasma at large baryonic densities . in all these cases the phase transition line in the plane of temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1",
    "has an end point .",
    "it is called the critical point ( cp ) , and it demonstrates some universal features typical for the second - order phase transitions , in particular , anomalously large fluctuations .",
    "the particle number fluctuations are characterized by the central moments , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , etc . , where @xmath5 denotes the event - by - event averaging and @xmath6 .",

    "in this work we use the van der waals ( vdw ) equation of state to study the measures ( [ osk ] ) of particle number fluctuations near the cp of the nuclear matter .",
    "the vdw model contains the first - order liquid - gas phase transition which ends at the cp . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the classical vdw equation of state has a simple and transparent form ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the system volume , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the vdw parameters that describe attractive and repulsive interactions , respectively , and @xmath24 is the particle number density .",
    "the cp corresponds to the temperature @xmath25 and particle number density @xmath26 , where @xmath27 in order to apply the vdw equation of state to systems with a variable number of particles the gce formulation is needed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following we consider the vdw equation of state for the system of interacting nucleons .",
    "we restrict our consideration to temperatures @xmath28  mev , thus , the production of new particles ( like pions ) is neglected .",
    "in addition , both the nucleon clusters ( i.e. , ordinary nuclei ) and the baryonic resonances ( like @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) are neglected . within these approximations",
    ", the number of nucleons , @xmath31 , becomes a conserved number , and the chemical potential @xmath1 of the gce regulates the number density of nucleons .    at low temperatures and/or high particle number densities",
    "the boltzmann approximation becomes inadequate and leads to unphysical negative values of the system entropy .",
    "the generalization of the vdw equation which includes effects of the quantum statistics was recently proposed in ref .",
    "the pressure and the particle density are then defined by the following system of two equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 functions : @xmath34 where @xmath35 the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the expressions for the quantum ideal gas pressure and particle density , respectively : @xmath38^{-1 } , \\label{p - id } \\\\ n^{\\rm id}(t,\\mu ) & = \\frac{g}{2\\pi^2 } \\int_0^{\\infty } k^2 dk \\nonumber \\\\ & \\quad \\times \\left [ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{m^2 + k^2}-\\mu}{t}\\right ) + \\eta\\right]^{-1 } , \\label{n - id}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the degeneracy factor ( the number of spin and isospin states ) and @xmath40 is the particle mass . in eqs .",
    "( [ p - id ] ) and ( [ n - id ] ) , @xmath41 for fermi statistics , @xmath42 for bose statistics , and @xmath43 for the boltzmann approximation .",
    "the vdw equation of state with fermi statistics was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the properties of symmetric nuclear matter . in this case ,",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  mev in eqs .   and .",
    "parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are fixed to reproduce the properties of nuclear matter in its ground state , i.e. , at @xmath49 it should be @xmath50 , @xmath51  @xmath19 , and the binding energy per nucleon @xmath52  mev .",
    "these conditions give @xmath53  mev@xmath54@xmath55 and @xmath56  @xmath55 .",
    "note that particle volume parameter @xmath48 is connected to its hard - core radius @xmath57^{1/3}\\cong 0.59 $ ]  fm . in the gce , at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , equations and may have more than one solution .",
    "in such a case a solution with the largest pressure is selected in accordance with the gibbs criteria ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the phase transition line , @xmath58 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tmu - n ]  ( a ) , starts from the normal nuclear matter state with @xmath49 , @xmath59  mev and ends at the cp with @xmath60  mev , @xmath61  mev ( this gives @xmath62  @xmath19 ) . leads to @xmath63  @xmath19 and @xmath64  mev .",
    "] at each point of the phase transition line , two solutions with different particle densities ( the liquid and gas states ) and equal pressures exist , i.e. , this is a line of the first - order phase transition . at @xmath65 only a single solution @xmath33 exists .",
    "nevertheless , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - tmu - n ] ( a ) , a rapid although continuous change of particle number density takes place in a narrow @xmath0-@xmath1 region ( the so - called crossover region ) even at @xmath65 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ osk ] ) one calculates the scaled variance @xmath7 $ ] as @xmath10 & = \\frac{k_2}{k_1 } = \\frac{t}{n } \\ , \\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_t \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\omega_{\\rm i d } ( t , \\mu^ * ) \\ , \\left [ \\frac{1}{(1-bn)^2 } - \\frac{2an}{t } \\ , \\omega_{\\rm i d } ( t , \\mu^ * ) \\right]^{-1 } , \\label{omegan }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath66^{-2 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 corresponds to the scaled variance of particle number fluctuations in the ideal fermi gas ( in the boltzmann approximation , @xmath67 , it is reduced to @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ omegan ] ) that the repulsive interactions suppress the particle number fluctuations , whereas the attractive interactions lead to their enhancement . the scaled variance ( [ omegan ] )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - tmu - n ] ( b ) . at any fixed value of temperature , @xmath7\\rightarrow 1 $ ] as @xmath1 decreases . in this case ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , thus , the boltzmann ideal gas results are recovered .",
    "the scaled variance becomes small , @xmath7\\ll 1 $ ] , as @xmath1 increases . in this case",
    ", the particle number density goes to its limiting value , @xmath71 .",
    "the scaled variance ( [ omegan ] ) diverges at the cp ( note that the thermodynamic limit @xmath72 is assumed ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig - tmu - n ] ( b ) the large values of @xmath7\\gg 1 $ ] take place along the crossover region , even far away from the cp .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ osk ] ) one also calculates the skewness @xmath73 + \\frac{t}{\\omega[n ] } \\ , \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\omega[n]}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_{t } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the kurtosis @xmath74}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)_{t } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shown in figs .",
    "[ tmu - skewness ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "similarly to the scaled variance , the skewness and kurtosis diverge at the cp .",
    "however , these higher moments of the particle number distribution show much richer structures : the behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath9 crucially depend on the path of approach to the cp .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ tmu - skewness ] ( a ) the liquid phase corresponds to @xmath75 , whereas the gas phase corresponds to @xmath76 .",
    "the line of @xmath77 goes from the critical point along the crossover region , and the @xmath0-@xmath1 regions with @xmath78 and @xmath79 are placed just under and above this line , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ tmu - skewness ] ( b ) it is also seen that the crossover region of the phase diagram is characterized by the significantly negative kurtosis , @xmath80",
    ". however , outside this crossover region one observes large positive values of the kurtosis , @xmath81 , in a rather wide @xmath0-@xmath1 area around the cp of nuclear matter .",
    "qualitatively , our findings with regards to the fluctuation patterns near the cp are consistent with previous results based on effective qcd models  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or on model - independent universality arguments with regards to critical behavior in the vicinity of the qcd critical point  @xcite .",
    "in summary , the fluctuation signatures of the nuclear matter cp  scaled variance , skewness , and kurtosis  are calculated within the quantum formulation of the vdw equation of state .",
    "the scaled variance diverges , @xmath7\\rightarrow \\infty$ ] , at the cp , and the large values of @xmath7\\gg 1 $ ] take place along the crossover region even far away from the cp .",
    "the behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the cp is more complicated .",
    "the limiting singular values of these quantities depend on the path of approach to the cp .",
    "the rich structures of the skewness and kurtosis are observed in the wide @xmath0-@xmath1 area around the cp of nuclear matter .",
    "we hope that results obtained in this paper can be useful for the identification of the cp signatures of nuclear matter in heavy - ion collision experiments .",
