    "collisions of nuclei at very high energies have been studied at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in recent years , in order to explore the formation and the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "one striking discovery was the fact that ideal hydrodynamics could describe many salient features of the expansion and cooling of the fireball @xcite .",
    "in particular the azimuthal asymmetry in collisions with nonzero impact parameter requires an onset of the hydrodynamic expansion at rather early times , between 0.5 and 1 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "this represents a puzzle since the application of ideal hydrodynamics mandates complete thermalization of the system .",
    "scenarios based on the picture of a dilute system of perturbatively interacting partons and minijets fail to describe early thermalization @xcite and the formation of anisotropic transverse flow @xcite .",
    "multi - parton interactions , either involving ternary collisions @xcite or collective effects mediated by plasma instabilities @xcite have been proposed as solutions to this problem . however , both mechanisms require a large initial entropy production before they can become effective .",
    "the color glass condensate model @xcite seemingly offers a viable explanation of the conundrum .",
    "it introduces the saturation scale @xmath1 which sets the scale for all dynamical processes . for rhic @xcite the magnitude of @xmath2",
    "is estimated to be approximately 2 gev@xmath3 , and thus thermalization times of order @xmath4 do not seem impossible . however , the production of entropy is a nontrivial problem in any model that is based on the assumption of the dominance of classical fields in the initial state , like the color glass condensate model @xcite .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that it is not clear how close quark - gluon matter must be to complete thermalization for hydrodynamics to be successful .",
    "it is also conceivable that a hydrodynamic evolution starting at a later time and supplemented by other mechanisms of transverse dynamics during the long _ off - equilibrium _ phase , can give an equally good or even better description of the data .",
    "for example , the anisotropic collective transverse flow may be generated , in part , by interactions of minijets with the bulk medium @xcite or by anisotropies in the initial gluon field @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations with viscous corrections describing small deviations from equilibrium start to become available @xcite and may soon help to test this possibility quantitatively .",
    "one necessary ingredient for thermalization is the decoherence of the initial gluon field .",
    "coherent fields can lead to large anisotropies in pressure and even negative pressure , which are symptoms of a state very far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus the decoherence time @xmath5 should be even smaller than the equilibration time @xmath6 .",
    "we argue that the fundamental process at work is somewhat analogous to coulomb explosion imaging , see @xcite , used routinely in molecular physics .",
    "if a molecule transverses a very thin metal foil all bonds are broken , the ions decohere and fly apart . from the momentum distribution of the fragments one can then extract information on the original wavefunction . in heavy ion collisions each lorentz contracted ion acts like such a foil for the other .    that the loss of information due to decoherence can generate a rapid increase in entropy in early phases of heavy ion collisions",
    "was realized already early on , e.g. by elze @xcite .",
    "the fact that the hydrodynamic evolution is known to be very close to the ideal one and thus isentropic in heavy ion collisions , further stresses the need for massive entropy production in very early phases .",
    "indeed , two of us have argued in @xcite , that decoherence can easily generate a large fraction of the total produced entropy .",
    "however , the question of the appropriate time scale of entropy production remained open .",
    "a computation of the decoherence time in leading order in perturbation theory was recently presented by two of us in @xcite . here , we want to strengthen this argument by presenting a calculation of the decoherence time as a function of the gluon 2-point function in the nucleus .",
    "we then proceed to evaluate our general result within the framework of the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by new results for the effects of the running of the coupling constant on the color glass condensate @xcite , which solve a hitherto unresolved uv problem .",
    "our result agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite within theoretical uncertainties and suggests that , indeed , @xmath7 , and that @xmath8 is numerically smaller than 1 fm/@xmath0 at rhic . in sec .  v we can then revisit some of our previous arguments @xcite about entropy production in the framework of the short decoherence times at rhic .",
    "we describe the gluons in a nucleus by a density operator @xmath9 . this nucleus is subjected to the incident gluon field of a second , large and very fast nucleus scattering off it .",
    "we compute the time evolution of the density operator @xmath9 under the influence of the perturbation presented by the second nucleus . in the following",
    "we denote the initial unperturbed gluon field of the first nucleus with @xmath10 , the final gluon field with @xmath11 and the field of the second nucleus with @xmath12 .",
    "the decoherence time of the gluon field @xmath11 is defined as the inverse decay time of the ratio @xmath13 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    let us introduce some useful notations .",
    "we deal with matrix elements @xmath14 of the density matrix .",
    "we can treat the final gluon field as almost on - shell for long times after the collision . in practice that means that we can decompose it in free modes @xmath15 characterized by momentum @xmath16 , polarization @xmath17 and color @xmath18 .",
    "we can use the same technique for the field @xmath12 of the fast moving nucleus 2 which is weizscker - williams - like . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial - state gluons @xmath10 in nucleus 1 are in a bound state and generally off - shell .",
    "we do not attempt to describe this field in detail .",
    "it turns out that the only two ingredients needed are an ansatz for the matrix elements @xmath19 of the density matrix of the bound fields , and the matrix elements @xmath20 of the hamiltonian coupling the fields @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in processes in which gluon modes @xmath10 of the nucleus at rest ( which are centered around rapidity @xmath21 ) are scattered into modes @xmath11 with large longitudinal momenta ( @xmath22 ) so that the overlap with the initial state is very small . in that case",
    "the leading contribution in the time evolution comes from second - order perturbation theory @xmath23 note that we have suppressed the field @xmath12 in the notation of the matrix elements .",
    "we treat the field @xmath12 rather as an external parameter given by the second nucleus .",
    "the interpretation of this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the initial and final gluons are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .     is close to zero .",
    "the weizscker - williams gluon with momentum @xmath24 has a nearly boost - invariant rapidity distribution .",
    "the distribution of the final gluon momentum @xmath25 is , therefore , also nearly boost - invariant . ]",
    "we have to specify the relevant part of the hamiltonian matrix element @xmath20 which is the three - gluon vertex with fields @xmath11 , @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is given by @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{eq : vertex}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 are the adjoint @xmath28 generators , @xmath29 are the structure constants of @xmath28 and @xmath30 is the coupling constant .",
    "note that we have used fourier transformations of the operators of the initial gluon field and the field of the second nucleus @xmath31 with operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is similar to the usual expansion of free fields , which we apply in our case to the final gluon field @xmath11 .",
    "[ eq : vertex ] is then analogous to the familiar case of three interacting fields that are asymptotically free .",
    "however , in order to respect the unknown dynamics of the initial field we do not specify the result of the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 acting on the initial states .",
    "rather , we use the matrix elements @xmath34 for given initial states @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ eq : vertex ] .",
    "we now consider measurements made at times much larger than the time it takes for the field @xmath10 to interact with the lorentz - contracted fast nucleus , i.e. @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the full integral @xmath38 over each three gluon vertex can be easily carried out .",
    "we define the evolution matrix for the time evolution of the density matrix elements as    @xmath39      \\left[(\\hat k+\\hat k')^{\\hat\\mu } g^{\\hat\\nu\\hat\\sigma }      - ( 2\\hat k-\\hat k')^{\\hat\\nu } g^{\\hat\\sigma\\hat\\mu }     + ( \\hat k-2\\hat k')^{\\hat \\sigma } g^{\\hat\\mu\\hat\\nu } \\right ]       \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    since the second nucleus is moving extremely fast and we are not interested the time evolution of its gluon fields @xmath12 , we have averaged over the fields in the second nucleus @xmath40 , leaving us with an expression that only depends on the initial and final fields in nucleus 1 .    arguing with translational and rotational invariance in the transverse plane @xcite and using that it is moving along the light cone",
    ", we can decompose the two - point correlation function of the gluon field of nucleus 2 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the scalar correlation function for the gluon field in the fast moving nucleus , and @xmath43 denote the transverse directions .",
    "thus far we have not made use of the fact that nucleus 1 is at rest and the results are valid in general as long as the phase space of initial and final gluons is sufficiently different .",
    "now we note that the final gluon momenta have large @xmath44 components , much larger than the original ones , i.e. @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the dominant terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) are those with the maximum number of factors @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "these are @xmath49 hence , the leading order contribution to the evolution operator for the gluon density matrix in our specific kinematic situation is @xmath50 where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath51 note that @xmath52 is essentially the product of the projections of the two polarization vectors onto the transverse direction given by the vector @xmath53 .",
    "the evolution of the gluon density matrix of nucleus 1 can now be computed through @xmath54 for our calculation , we do not need the nuclear density matrix itself , but just the expectation value of @xmath55 in the ground state of nucleus 1 . as in @xcite",
    "we use an _ ansatz _ for this expectation value which is diagonal and exhibits a gaussian momentum distribution with width @xmath56 : @xmath57    in order to determine the normalization constant @xmath58 we could calculate the energy density of gluons in the nucleus , @xmath59 $ ] , but we will see later that our final result does not depend on @xmath60",
    ".    returning to the expression ( [ eq : dfinal ] ) for the final - state density matrix , we obtain @xmath61 the @xmath62-function enforces @xmath63 . furthermore , we can use @xmath64 to argue that @xmath65 because the projections in @xmath52 are maximal if @xmath66 and the average value upon integration over the directions of @xmath67 should be @xmath68 . the same argument also allows us to use the approximation @xmath69 , allowing for three polarization states of the off - shell gluons in nucleus 1 .",
    "we can thus write @xmath70 we now introduce the convolution of the gluon two - point function with the gaussian profile @xmath71 and thus obtain our final expression for the final - state gluon density matrix ( [ eq : dfinal ] ) : @xmath72 where the three - dimensional delta function refers to the `` @xmath73 '' and `` @xmath74 '' components of the momenta .",
    "we note that the density matrix resulting from the interaction with the external gluon field for large times is diagonal in all quantum numbers except for the longitudinal momentum , in accordance with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we proceed to calculate the traces .",
    "@xmath75 the integral over @xmath47 should be regulated by a phase space projection , because the gluons are ( almost ) on the mass - shell , but there is no need to specify the details here .",
    "we have also assumed that the final - state gluons can carry only transverse polarizations , because they are nearly on mass - shell .",

    "this fact is in line with our intuitive picture in analogy to coulomb - explosion : decoherence occurs due to the fact that lorentz contracted nucleus 2 , which acts as if consisting of incoherent color - charges , passes through nucleus 1 .    the result we obtained coincides with that of our previous calculation in predicting a decoherence behavior @xmath85 at leading order @xcite .",

    "the correct implementation of the running coupling is a topic of intense investigations .",
    "we follow the prescription by kovchegov and weigert @xcite and substitute @xmath101    for @xmath88 we obtain @xmath102 where we used the 1-loop running coupling with @xmath103 obviously this is a well defined expression , while @xmath88 without the running coupling would have led to a logarithmic uv divergence .    on the other hand , after two gaussian integrations we see that @xmath104 ^ 2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the scale @xmath96 should be chosen such that for typical transverse momenta @xmath105 ideally fulfills @xcite @xmath106 for @xmath107 between 0 and @xmath108 the ratio of the logarithms should hence obey @xmath109 we conclude that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is given by the last expression in eq .",

    "the number of significantly contributing elements is given by the width , @xmath157 , of the poisson distribution .",
    "that the decoherence entropy is controlled by @xmath158 , rather than by @xmath159 , can be seen by considering more general pure quantum states , for which the average occupation number @xmath159 and the occupation number uncertainty @xmath158 are not related . for a pure state with @xmath160 and in the gaussian approximation , it is straightforward to show that the decoherence entropy is given by @xmath161 confirming our assertion . for a classical coherent state ( [ eq3 ] ) ,",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the decoherence and equilibrium entropies as a function of the average occupation number @xmath159 . for not too large values of @xmath159 , the decoherence process generates a large fraction of the equilibrium entropy , and any subsequent equilibration process adds only a small amount of entropy to it .",
    "what does this imply for quantum field theory , where the field is a system of infinitely many coupled oscillators ?",

    "<S> short thermalization times of less than 1 fm/@xmath0 for quark and gluon matter have been suggested by recent experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been difficult to justify this rapid thermalization in first - principle calculations based on perturbation theory or the color glass condensate picture . here , </S>",
    "<S> we address the related question of the decoherence of the gluon field , which is a necessary component of thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simplified leading - order computation of the decoherence time of a gluon ensemble subject to an incoming flux of weizscker - williams gluons . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the entropy produced during the decoherence process and its relation to the entropy in the final state which has been measured experimentally . </S>"
