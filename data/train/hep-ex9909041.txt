    "the nutev experiment ran at fermilab using the refurbished lab e detector   @xcite and @xmath31 and @xmath32 beams provided by the newly installed sign - selected quadrupole train ( ssqt )  @xcite .",
    "the ssqt has the capability of selecting either muon neutrino or muon anti - neutrino beams while leaving @xmath33 of the anti - selected type .",
    "the lab e detector , located 1.5 km downstream of the primary target , consists of a target / calorimeter followed by a toroid spectrometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : labe ] ) .",
    "the calorimeter is composed of 42 segments of four steel plates , two liquid scintillator counters ( sc ) and one drift chamber ( dc ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calseg ] ) .",
    "the steel provides mass for the neutrino target ,    the sc measure the longitudinal vertex and energy deposition ( @xmath34 ) , and the dc are used to find the transverse vertex    and reconstruct downstream tracks . because of the high density of the target , only muons deeply penetrate the calorimeter , and all other particles create a hadronic or electromagnetic shower near the interaction vertex .",
    "the toroid spectrometer , located immediately downstream of the calorimeter , focuses muons from the primary charged - current vertex given the type of beam ( @xmath35  or @xmath36 ) , measuring both charge and momentum ( @xmath15 ) of muons with @xmath37 gev / c which enter the spectrometer .",
    "it is also possible to measure the momentum of a subset of muons with @xmath38 gev / c which range out in the calorimeter , and to place a lower bound on the momentum of muons which exit the side of the calorimeter .",
    "the nutev detector was calibrated with a separate beam of hadrons , muons , or electrons throughout the running period of the experiment .",
    "hadronic and muon energy scales for the calorimeter were determined to 0.43@xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively over the energy range @xmath41 gev  @xcite .",
    "muon momentum measurement in the spectrometer is limited by multiple coulomb scattering to @xmath42 , and the sampling - dominated hadronic resolution was approximately @xmath43 .",
    "analyses presented here use the full nutev data sample from the 1996 - 1997 fixed - target run corresponding to @xmath44 protons on target ( pot ) for neutrino running and @xmath45 protons on target for anti - neutrino running .",
    "the size of various event samples from nutev are listed in table  [ tab : nevents ] .",
    "events were selected for the low-@xmath7 two - muon analysis based on the following criteria :    * the event vertex was required to be at least 25 cm from any side , 40 cm steel - equivalent from the upstream end and 1.4 m steel - equivalent from the downstream end of the calorimeter . *",
    "at least two muons were required to be found and fitted by the tracking code .",
    "at least one of these had to be reconstructed in the toroid spectrometer with a momentum greater than 9 gev / c .",
    ".nutev event samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     cdhs measurement as diffractive production is contradicted by our limit ; however , the cdhs  @xmath7 cut of @xmath46 gev compared to a mean neutrino energy of 70 gev could have accepted dis production of @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis was repeated with a higher e@xmath47 cut ( e@xmath47 @xmath48 10 gev ) which matches the cdhs selection .",
    "the results are also included in table  [ tab : diffjpsi ] .",
    "the limit as a function of @xmath49 is shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsicompare ] .",
    "while this limit is near the cdhs measurement , the diffractive @xmath30 monte carlo shows the lower e@xmath47 ( @xmath483 gev ) is appropriate for coherent diffractive production .",
    "one possible explanation is that the higher cut allows a contribution from dis @xmath30 production .    for completeness ,",
    "the @xmath7 cut was changed to @xmath50 gev to allow a search for inclusive dis @xmath4 production .",
    "figure  [ fig : disjpsilim ] shows the resulting @xmath51 distribution .",
    "a fit was performed with the background modelled by an asymmetric gaussian function and the data binned in 0.5 gev / c@xmath52 intervals .",
    "no statistically significant @xmath4 signal was found , and 90@xmath39 confidence level limits for the ( dis @xmath30)/(dis cc charm ) rates were found to be @xmath53 @xmath54 when averaged over the nutev beam spectra . assuming a similar energy dependence to dis cc charm production , this corresponds to cross - section limits evaluated at @xmath55 gev , @xmath56 @xmath57 at an average dis cc charm production energy of @xmath49 = 125 gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : disjpsilim ] shows the 90@xmath39 cl curve for the inclusive ( e@xmath47 @xmath58 10 gev ) dis two - muon sample .",
    "we have performed an inclusive analysis of the low - e@xmath47 two - muon data sample available from nutev .",
    "all known standard model processes have been considered , and four significant sources were found to contribute : dis , neutrino trident , diffractive @xmath28 , and diffractive @xmath29 .",
    "we have measured diffractive @xmath28 and @xmath29 cross - sections to be @xmath59 fb / nucleon and @xmath60 fb / nucleon , respectively , for @xmath61 scattering at @xmath62 gev , in agreement with previous results assuming a vmd energy dependence of the cross - section .",
    "we observe a statistically weak neutrino trident signal consistent with standard model predictions . finally , we see no evidence for either diffractive or dis production of @xmath4 in nc @xmath31 and @xmath32 scattering on iron .",
    "we would like to thank the staffs of the fermilab particle physics and beams divisions for their contributions to the construction and operation of the nutev beamlines .",
    "we would also like to thank the staffs of our home institutions for their help throughout the running and analysis of nutev .",
