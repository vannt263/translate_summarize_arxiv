    "in 1995 , the karmen experiment at the rutherford appleton laboratory reported an anomaly in the time distribution of the charged and neutral current events induced by neutrinos from @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays at rest @xcite .",
    "this was ascribed to the production of a new particle , denoted @xmath6 , in the anomalous pion decay @xmath7 with a small branching ratio in the range @xmath8 depending on the lifetime of @xmath6 .",
    "the particle must be neutral since it passes through over 7  m of steel shielding .",
    "the time - of - flight to the detector is @xmath9 , implying that the particle moves non - relativistically with velocity @xmath10  ms@xmath11 .",

    "the observed energy in the detector is @xmath13  mev , which must therefore come from the decay of @xmath6 . since",
    "1995 the karmen experiment has been upgraded to significantly reduce the cosmic ray background .",
    "it has recently been reported that the time anomaly persists in the new data @xcite . a time - of - flight likelihood analysis adopting the hypothesis that it is due to a decaying particle as described above has a negative natural log - likelihood ratio of 9 , i.e. less than 1 in @xmath14 chance of being a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the significance is thus sufficiently high that we are motivated to reexamine its physical origin .",
    "there have already been several proposals to explain the karmen anomaly @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the authors considered in detail the possibility that @xmath6 is a neutrino and concluded that a @xmath15 doublet neutrino was excluded by existing data .",
    "this was further reinforced by the subsequent improvement @xcite in the experimental upper limit on the branching ratio , @xmath16 versus the minimum value of @xmath17 required in the doublet neutrino interpretation .",
    "however a sterile neutrino interpretation was found to be consistent , within strict limits on the mixing parameters ( see also ref.@xcite ) , although this may still be in conflict with astrophysical and cosmological constraints @xcite .    in ref.@xcite",
    "a solution was proposed based on the anomalous muon decay @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is taken to be a scalar boson of mass 103.9  mev .",
    "however this implies too large a value for the energy released in the @xmath6 decay and the required branching ratio is also constrained by the recent bound br@xmath19 ( 90%  c.l . )",
    "thus it is necessary to add to the model 2 other scalar bosons into which @xmath6 can cascade decay in order to dilute the energy @xcite .",
    "this model appears viable but is somewhat baroque .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", a supersymmetric solution was considered .",
    "the @xmath6 particle was interpreted as a photino ( or zino ) and the anomalous pion decay @xmath20 was assumed to proceed via the r - parity violating operator @xmath21 .",
    "the same operator then enables the photino to decay radiatively as @xmath22 via a one - loop diagram with a @xmath23 quark and @xmath24 squark in the loop .",
    "however the expected peak at 17  mev has not been reported in the new data @xcite on the energy spectrum of the anomalous events , so a 2-body decay for the @xmath6 particle seems disfavoured",
    ". therefore this model @xcite may not be viable in its present form .",
    "we present below the necessary extension to produce a 3-body decay for such a light neutralino . in the superpotential to be unnaturally small , @xmath25  mev .",
    "moreover this scenario implies a mev mass @xmath26 which is definitively ruled out by cosmological and astrophysical arguments @xcite . ]",
    "we consider the lightest neutralino in supersymmetry , @xmath27 , to be the hypothetical @xmath6 particle , with mass @xmath28  mev .",
    "this will also be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in our model .",
    "since @xmath6 is effectively stable on collider time - scales ( this is quantified below ) our model will experimentally look very similar to the mssm .",
    "now in a gut - inspired mssm , @xmath29 , and assuming this relation requires @xmath30  gev from current lep data @xcite .",
    "thus in order to obtain a very light neutralino we must consider @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be independent parameters .",
    "a small @xmath1 implies at least one light chargino which is excluded by experiment , while a small @xmath0 implies that the lsp will be dominantly bino .",
    "we will quantify this below and determine regions in the @xmath31 parameter space consistent with all experimental limits .",
    "the solutions indeed turn out to be dominantly bino with a small higgsino contribution .",

    "the calculation of these parameters is based on an expansion in @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the momentum scale of the gauge boson propagator , typically @xmath89 or smaller and @xmath90 is the scale of the new physics , assumed to be well above @xmath89 .",
    "if however there are new _ light _ particles in the spectrum , as in the present case , these approximations are typically insufficient and one must in general also calculate the box or vertex corrections @xcite .",

    "massive particles are expected to come into thermal equilibrium in the early universe and their relic abundance is essentially the equilibrium value at ` freeze - out ' when their self - annihilation rate drops below the hubble expansion rate . for the neutralino under consideration ,",
    "the self - annihilation cross - section is ( s - wave ) suppressed @xcite so the surviving abundance is rather high : @xmath103 this energy density will be subsequently released when the neutralinos decay and this has the potential to disrupt standard cosmology , in particular primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "specifically , since the neutralinos will be non - relativistic during nucleosynthesis , the hubble expansion rate will be speeded up , while the electromagnetic energy generated through the subsequent decays will dilute the nucleon - to - photon ratio , resulting in an increased helium-4 abundance @xcite .",
    "the decay electrons will also compton scatter the thermal background photons to energies high enough to directly alter the abundance of e.g. deuterium through photodissociation @xcite .",
    "the observationally inferred primordial abundances thus enable stringent bounds to be placed on the relic abundance of the decaying particle as a function of its lifetime . for the above abundance ( [ cosmoabund ] ) , the decay lifetime is required to be less than a few thousand seconds in order that the primordial d / h ratio is not reduced below its conservative lower limit of @xmath104 , and further required to be less than a few hundred seconds in order that the primordial @xmath105he mass fraction not exceed its conservative upper limit of 25% @xcite .",
    "thus the cosmological lifetime bound is essentially the same as the one derived earlier ( [ psi4 ] ) from experimental considerations .",
    "very light neutralinos can also be produced through nucleon bremsstrahlung and @xmath106 annihilation in supernovae such as sn  1987a . since the squark /",
    "selectron masses are now restricted to be above @xmath107 @xcite , the neutralinos can not be trapped in the supernova core by scatterings on nuclei or electrons , so will escape freely . the energy lost through this process can be comparable to the neutrino luminosity so may result in significant shortening of the @xmath108 burst . the neutralino luminosity can be decreased by increasing the sfermion mass but it has been shown that consistency with observations of sn  1987a is not possible for any sfermion mass less than @xmath109  tev @xcite .",
    "this constraint is evaded if the neutralino is unstable due to r - parity violation , as in the present case .",
    "however there are then further constraints on the energy released in the decays . given the experimental upper bound ( [ psi4 ] ) as well as the cosmological upper bound on the lifetime",
    ", the decays would have occurred _ within _ the progenitor star .",
    "moreover the lower bound ( [ bounds ] ) on the lifetime implies that the neutralinos can not have decayed within the supernova core .",
    "the electromagnetic energy released in the decays would have been thermalised leading to distortions of the lightcurve .",
    "however the neutralinos under consideration here have a mass which is of the same order as the core temperature @xcite so one must reconsider their production rate in order to quantify this potentially important constraint .",
    "in 1997 , the hera collaborations reported an anomaly in their high @xmath110 data @xcite whose most likely explanation was in terms of r - parity violation @xcite .",
    "however , this required a significant @xmath111 operator .",
    "while this is not excluded by our model it is a completely distinct possibility .",
    "together the two operators might contribute to the decay @xmath112 .",
    "however this does not lead to a significant new bound since the bound on the coupling @xmath39 is already so strict @xcite .",
    "the trilinear r - parity violating couplings we have introduced also generate majorana masses for neutrinos through one - loop self - energy diagrams @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a colour factor , and @xmath115 is the left - right mixing term in the sfermion sector . the question then arises whether our model can account also for the superkamiokande data suggesting oscillation of atmospheric @xmath116 into @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the neutrinos mix almost maximally and that they are nearly mass - degenerate , @xmath118  ev@xmath119 .",
    "if neutrino masses are hierarchical then the natural interpretation is that one of the neutrinos ( presumably the @xmath117 ) has a mass of @xmath120  ev ( although the possibility of a close mass - degeneracy for a heavier @xmath116@xmath117 pair is not excluded ) . now",
    "the sfermion left - right mixing is not well determined , however within a given framework , e.g. supergravity - inspired models , approximate relations such as @xmath121 arise .",
    "thus @xmath39 , the coupling responsible in our model for the pion decaying to the neutralino , generates a mass @xmath122 which is too small to be of phenomenological interest .",
    "the couplings @xmath40 responsible for neutralino decay also generate rather small masses : @xmath123 thus the absolute scale of the masses seems too low to explain the data on atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "however if other r - parity violating couplings are also present , it may well be possible to generate a neutrino mass pattern consistent with the observations , both of atmospheric and solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "experimentally , our model largely looks like the mssm with non - universal gaugino masses and with a very light lsp .",
    "thus most future tests of the mssm also apply to our model , e.g. chargino pair production",
    ". a specific test would be to identify a very light lsp for example via neutralino pair production @xcite . at an @xmath106 collider",
    "one can study the process @xmath124 where @xmath74 subsequently decays visibly @xcite . in fig .",

    "the value of @xmath130 is too small for the observation of resonant slepton production at hadron colliders @xcite .",

    "one can also test for the first generation via the mechanism described in ref.@xcite .",
    "a further upgrade of the karmen detector may allow a better resolution of the decay of the @xmath6 particle , in particular the angular distribution of the decay products . for reference",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : angledist ] the differential decay rate of the lsp in our model as a function of the angle between the two final state electrons .",
    "the karmen time anomaly is particularly intriguing because contrary to several other reported @xmath133 effects in the literature , its significance has not diminished with improved statistics , nor has it been explained away as a systematic effect .",
    "in fact the anomaly persists in the karmen-2 data , which has a much reduced background @xcite , with the same characteristics as in the karmen-1 data @xcite .",
    "it would appear that there is no independent experiment which has the sensitivity to reproduce this result .",
    "in particular although the lsnd experiment also studies pions and muons decaying at rest , it lacks the distinctive time - structure of the beam in the karmen experiment necessary to isolate the anomaly .",
    "since karmen-2 acquires only of @xmath134 anomaly events per year of running , it is clear that a definitive resolution of the problem will have to await an upgraded detector with tracking capability .",
    "phenomenological models for the anomaly as due to the production and decay of a new particle are very tightly constrained .",
    "the only viable proposals at present are a singlet neutrino decaying through its large mixing with the @xmath117 @xcite , or a neutralino decaying through violation of r - parity @xcite which we have extended and investigated in detail .",
    "an important lesson from our investigation is that contrary to popular belief a neutralino lighter than even the pion is _ not _ excluded by present accelerator data unless a gut relation between gaugino masses is assumed . whether the karmen anomaly is indeed the first evidence for such a particle is a matter for future experiments to decide .",
    "* note added : * while this manuscript was under review , the e815 ( nutev ) experiment at fermilab reported a search for a 33.9 mev neutral particle produced in pion decay decaying to a partially electomagnetic state such as @xmath135 or @xmath136 ( j.a .",
