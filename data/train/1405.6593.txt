    "we will now derive bounds upon the secret key rate for the 8 members of the gaussian family of cvqkd protocols . in the prepare and measure setting ( p&m ) protocols correspond to alice sending either squeezed @xcite or coherent states @xcite and bob measuring with either homodyne or heterodyne @xcite detection .",
    "each permutation can in turn be used to have bob try and guess alice s encoding , called direct reconciliation @xcite ( dr ) , or alice trying to guess bob s measurement @xcite , called reverse reconciliation ( rr ) .",
    "one can also consider entanglement based ( eb ) schemes in which alice distributes one arm of a two - mode squeezed vacuum to bob @xcite . in fact these methods can be seen as equivalent since if alice heterodyne detects one arm of a squeezed vacuum this corresponds to sending coherent states , while a homodyne detection corresponds to squeezed state protocols @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will calculate the key rates assuming all parties have chosen to measure in the @xmath26 basis . in general",
    "the total key rate will be the average of the this quantity and the analogous expression with @xmath26 and @xmath54 labels permuted .",
    "first we turn to the protocols where both alice and bob homodyne detect . here",
    "alice and bob randomly choose whether they measure the @xmath26 of @xmath54 basis and only keep those times where they agree .",
    "we work in the asymptotic regime @xmath55 where the optimal attacks are known to be the collective attacks . considering the case where bob makes an @xmath26 measurement ,",
    "we can write the secret key rate for the dr protocol as @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the classical mutual information between alice and bob , with @xmath58 being the continuous shannon entropy of the measurement strings and @xmath59 is the holevo bound .    substituting ( [ iab ] ) and ( [ ie ] ) in ( [ k ] ) and comparing with the continuous conditional von neumann entropy @xmath60 we have , @xmath61    which is what one would expect from the devetak - winter relations @xcite . using the entropic style uncertainty relations allows us to bound the eavesdroppers information on the relevant observable . substituting ( [ uc2 ] ) from the main text and recalling that @xmath62 we can write , @xmath63    thus we have bounded the secret key by an expression that depends only upon the conditional shannon entropies and the complementarity of the measurements , both of which are directly accessible to alice and bob .",
    "furthermore one can show via a differential calculation that for any probability distribution @xmath35 the corresponding shannon entropy is maximised for a gaussian distribution of the same variance .",
    "in other words , alice and bob can bound their secret key rate for this protocol by measuring bob s conditional variance . substituting the shannon entropy for a gaussian distribution @xmath64 and @xmath65 we arrive at a final expression for the key rate of @xmath66 the rr expression",
    "is obtained by simply permuting the labels of alice and bob .",
    "the fact that this result can be pessimistic is immediately apparent if we consider the predictions for a perfect channel . under the security proofs presented in @xcite",
    "if alice and bob share an pure epr state ( real or effective ) with variance @xmath67 then the key rate is always positive provided the squeezing parameter is non - zero ( @xmath68 ) . on the other hand",
    "the above result is only positive for @xmath69 which implies a squeezing parameter of @xmath70 or about 1.3 db .",
    "this result was also calculated in @xcite , however as mentioned before the proof relies on the assumption of the applicability of the entropic uncertainty relation to infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "furthermore ferenczi argues that since for coherent states the directly measured conditional variances are always greater than 1 the above procedure would never predict a positive key rate for coherent state protocols .",
    "however this conclusion comes from a mistaken application of the key rate formulae as we now demonstrate .",
    "consider a dr coherent state protocol , which in the entanglement based picture involves alice making a heterodyne detection upon her arm of an epr pair .",
    "thus she first mixes her mode with vacuum resulting in two modes @xmath71 and @xmath72 upon which she measured @xmath26 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "bob is still making a homodyne detection , randomly switching between the quadratures .",
    "we will consider the case where bob measures @xmath26 , with the other case following straightforwardly .",
    "the dr key rate is then given by , @xmath73 after alice s projective measurement upon @xmath72 the state @xmath74 is pure and we can again apply the entropic uncertainty relation to write , @xmath75    now this formula might pose a problem , in that we do not measure @xmath54 upon mode @xmath71 , but this can be circumvented if we trust the devices , specifically the beamsplitter , in alice s station for we then have @xmath76 which is measured .",
    "we therefore have , @xmath77 for reverse reconciliation the key rate is given by , @xmath78    once again , the quantity @xmath79 is not measured directly , but provided we trust alice s beamsplitter we have @xmath80 allowing us to evaluate the bound .",
    "these protocols are essentially mirror images coherent state homodyne schemes since , in the eb picture , we now have alice making homodyne measurements and bob making heterodyne measurements .",
    "we now have alice swapping between @xmath26 and @xmath54 measurements while bob splits up his mode measuring @xmath26 upon @xmath81 and @xmath54 upon @xmath82 .",
    "the dr key rate is given by ,    @xmath83 where we will need to trust the beamsplitter in bob s station to obtain @xmath84 from the directly measured conditional variance .",
    "the rr key rate is given by ,    @xmath85 where we have again used the form of bob s beamsplitter to write @xmath86 .",
    "the final protocols involve bob making a heterodyne measurement upon coherent states , or alternatively both parties making heterodyne measurements upon an two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "thus there are now four modes involved @xmath71 and @xmath81 upon which @xmath26 is measured and @xmath72 and @xmath82 upon which @xmath54 is measured",
    ". we can consider the @xmath26 and @xmath54 channels separately .",
    "note that this is actually an underestimation of the key rate as it essentially allowing eve to devote all her resources to estimating the @xmath26 and @xmath54 measurements separately whereas she must in fact estimate both simultaneously .",
    "the dr key rate for @xmath26 is given by , @xmath87 provided we trust the beamsplitter in bob s station we can calculate @xmath88 .",
    "the rr key rate is given by , @xmath89 provided we trust the beamsplitter in alice and bob s station we can calculate @xmath90 .",
    "another important benefit of utilising entropic uncertainty relations in qkd proofs is that they lend themselves towards one - sided device independent ( 1sdi ) protocols @xcite . for 1sdi - qkd protocols only one of alice or bob",
    "is untrusted and the security is now related to the recently classified steering inequalities @xcite .",
    "the 1sdi nature of entropic proofs is manifest in expressions like ( [ kh ] ) in that one can immediately see it depends only upon measuring a known observable upon one side .",
    "more precisely , for a term like @xmath91 we must be sure that the observable upon alice s side is indeed an @xmath26 measurement but we need make no assumptions about what bob is actually measuring , we simply evaluate the conditional variance .",
    "we note that the proof provided in @xcite is also 1sdi , being independent of alice s devices .",
    "however this device independence does not necessarily extend to the protocols involving heterodyne detection or coherent states ( recall that this is alternatively a heterodyne detection on alice s side in the entanglement based picture ) .",
    "this is essentially because the proof to derive rates such as ( [ kcoh ] ) depends upon characterising the beamsplitter on the supposedly untrusted side thereby invalidating the device independence .",
    "nonetheless the remaining protocols , with the heterodyne detection taking place in the trusted station , are still implementable with high efficiency sources and detection opening the way to long range 1sdi - cvqkd protocols with current technology .",
    "this means that for real epr states both dr and rr are secure provided all parties are homodyning , while bob may safely heterodyne for an rr protocol and alice may heterodyne for a dr protocol .",
    "finally , for dr protocols where alice , who controls the source , is trusted we may also safely make the equivalence between p&m and eb schemes . remarkably , this means that for direct reconciliation is is possible to generate 1sdi key using only coherent states .",
    "we summarise which of the 16 possible protocols are 1sdi in table 1 in the main text ."

    "<S> by considering entropic versions of these uncertainty relations @xcite an intimate connection between entanglement and uncertainty has recently been derived @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this has been know since the seminal work of einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite but was only recently quantified to derive an entropic uncertainty relation including the possibility of quantum correlations @xcite .    beyond fundamental interest , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated the usefulness of such relations by compactly re - deriving the secret key rate for the bb84 discrete variable quantum key distribution ( dvqkd ) protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of similar relations for the smooth min- and max- entropies @xcite , which are appropriate in the non - asymptotic setting , eventually resulted in finite - size bounds for dvqkd that are both general and tight @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , security proofs of device independent ( di ) qkd protocols , in which stronger subsets of quantum correlations are used to remove the requirement for the experimental devices themselves to be trusted @xcite , have also proved amenable to these entropic relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , entropic relations also naturally lend themselves to situations where only one party s devices are untrusted . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility , first noted in @xcite was subsequently used to prove the security of an experimentally challenging , but feasible , proposal for one - sided device independent ( 1sdi ) dvqkd protocols which are strongly related to the concept of epr steering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an extension ref.@xcite to the infinite dimensional hilbert spaces relevant for cv - qkd @xcite has also been applied to propose a discretised 1sdi - cvqkd protocol that accounted for finite - size effects @xcite and a demonstration of scheme independent of bob s devices only , has recently been carried out @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we pursue the study of device independence for cvqkd and show that the hardware advantages that drastically improve the ease of detection - loophole free steering tests @xcite , also render 1sdi - cvqkd practical in the near term . </S>",
    "<S> firstly we briefly review progress in entropic uncertainty relations and find culminating in a recently derived uncertainty relation for continuously valued measurements on infinite - dimensional systems , e.g. position and momentum measurements of a harmonic oscillator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this relation was independently found by @xcite although the latter derivation is incomplete . applying this relation to the entire family of gaussian cvqkd protocols </S>",
    "<S> we find that the consequent bounds are quite loose with respect to existing results . </S>",
    "<S> however , analysing these bounds from the perspective of one - sided device independence , we find that several of the protocols considered are in fact inherently 1sdi , with the key rate displaying an elegant connection to the relevant steering parameter . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of their performance over realistic channels shows that 1sdi - cvqkd protocols are feasible , reasonably robust to losses , and hence more practical than their discrete variable counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the surprising result that 1sdi - cvqkd is possible , albeit over a more limited range , using only coherent states .    _ entropic uncertainty relations for continuous variable systems. _ originally , entropic uncertainty relations were derived assuming one starts without any additional information or with only classical information describing the system in question , i.e. the density matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the more general case , allowing for quantum side information , was derived in @xcite though only for finite dimensional hilbert spaces and observables with a discrete spectrum , and proceeds as follows . consider a pair of observables @xmath0 with a complementarity @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the eigenvectors of the observables . </S>",
    "<S> these are to be measured on a state @xmath3 which is potentially entangled with another state , @xmath4 , leading to the the following relation for the uncertainty in the pair of observables including access to @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 here @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the conditional von neumann entropy of the state @xmath8 whereas @xmath9 is the conditional von neumann entropy of the _ observable _ @xmath10 measured on @xmath3 given by , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the classical shannon entropy .    preempting applications to qkd </S>",

    "<S> using the purity of the overall state ( i.e. @xmath14 ) one can recast ( [ uc1 ] ) to find @xcite , @xmath15 these results have since seen several generalisations both to different entropies and to positive - operator values measurements ( povm s ) @xmath16 @xcite for which @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the infinity or operator norm . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite although the former proof is incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative derivation was also provided by frank and lieb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the final result is the following relation for homodyne detection upon infinite dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite , @xmath25 _ application to cvqkd. _ the most common cvqkd protocols are the gaussian state protocols which encode information in the quadratures of the optical field which are described exactly by operators like @xmath26 and @xmath27 described above . </S>",
    "<S> one can use squeezed @xcite or coherent @xcite states , and measure with either homodyne detection , switching between quadratures , or heterodyne detection @xcite where both are measured simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> one could also use gaussian entangled states @xcite and these approaches have been shown to be equivalent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the communicating parties , called alice and bob in this context , can also use either a direct reconciliation ( dr ) scheme where alice sends corrections to bob or a reverse reconciliation ( rr ) @xcite which allows for losses above 50% . </S>",
    "<S> one can also achieve this loss - tolerance via a post - selection protocol which discards some of the key in order to retain a more correlated subset @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , however the proof there was incomplete as it relied on the assumption of the applicability of the entropic uncertainty relation . </S>",

    "<S> for example the key rate for the dr protocol with coherent states and homodyne detection is given by @xmath39    unfortunately these bounds are actually more pessimistic than previous results @xcite as the uncertainty relation becomes quite loose in the relevant case of large losses . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , in the derivation of ( [ kh ] ) we only need to know that bob is measuring either @xmath40 or @xmath41 in order to apply the entropic uncertainty relation . </S>",
    "<S> although we write expressions @xmath42 , as this is what will be measured in most experiments , alice could be making any measurement and the security would still hold provided the conditional variance was sufficiently small .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> 1sdi - dvqkd protocols are analysed and although within reach of present technology are very challenging , significantly more so than standard dvqkd as one must perform a detection - loophole - free steering test . </S>",
    "<S> this is difficult because on the untrusted side one can not post - select away events where there is no single - photon detection , which necessitates high detection efficiencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to the cv case , where steering is demonstrated via homodyne measurements which are unconditional and thus immune to detection loopholes . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it has since been shown @xcite that cv steering is equivalent to the so - called einstein - podolsky - rosen violation @xcite which has been experimentally feasible for over 20 years @xcite and now sees very strong violations @xcite . for the gaussian cv states relevant to qkd , steering is demonstrated by a violation of the condition on the conditional variances , @xmath43 for alice steering bob @xcite . comparison with eq .  </S>",

    "<S> however this device independence does not necessarily extend to the protocols involving heterodyne detection this is essentially because the proof to derive rates such as ( [ kcoh ] ) depends upon characterising the beamsplitter on the supposedly untrusted side thereby invalidating the device - independence . </S>",

    "<S> the noise parameter can be thought of as the noise input to the channel in the sense that a pure state with variance of unity would have a variance @xmath50 after the channel . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting imperfections such as detector and reconciliation efficiency this is the chief factor limiting range . in fig.[kcohrr ] we plot the secure regions for all 4 distinct 1sdi protocols ( there are two redundancies between p&m and eb schemes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best performing scheme is the rr epr scheme where both parties homodyne . in the limit of low excess noise </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is secure for up to 73% loss . </S>",
    "<S> for very low noises the next best scheme is the rr protocol where bob heterodyne detects but for higher noises the dr protocol with both parties homodyning ( or alternatively where alice sends squeezed states ) performs better . finally , although the dr coherent state scheme performs the poorest it is still secure up to around 33% loss . </S>",

    "<S> we choose a low , but achievable excess noise of @xmath53 as measured in @xcite and find that for this kind of channel the homodyne - homodyne rr epr protocol is by far the best performing allowing for 1sdi security out to almost 30 km .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions. _ we have applied an entropic uncertainty relation that is valid for continuous measurements and infinite dimensional hilbert spaces to the gaussian cvqkd protocols and demonstrated that in the limit of infinitely long key one can derive bounds for several protocols that are one - sided device independent . remarkably we find that even protocols based on sending coherent states can be made independent of bob s detectors ( usually the target of side channel attacks ) for low - loss and low - noise channels . </S>",
    "<S> the protocols involving epr states and homodyne detection were substantially more robust allowing independence from alice s devices for up to 42% pure loss and independence of bob s devices for up to 73% loss pure loss . </S>",

    "<S> an extension to rr homodyne protocols , for both the asymptotic and finite - size regimes , secure up to 15 km has also appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears very promising then , that these techniques could be adapted to prove the finite - size security of all the other protocols presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> a second avenue would be to revisit the restrictions , or lack thereof , made about the eavesdropper including physical assumptions about the quantum memory available to eve @xcite , which has already seen application in di - dvqkd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another candidate to further extend the range of these protocols would be the noiseless linear amplifier @xcite which has already been proposed for application to fully di - dvqkd @xcite as well as bell tests @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more appealing may be the measurement based versions of these amplification schemes @xcite that have recently been experimentally demonstrated @xcite in light of these results it appears that several 1sdi - cvqkd protocols are within the reach of current technology and multiple possibilities exist to extend the secure range of such schemes to long distances .    _ </S>",
