    "currently there are several proposals to use phosphine gas ( ph@xmath0 ) to create atomic - scale devices by positioning p atoms on a surface using h - lithography .",
    "@xcite one such idea  @xcite involves the fabrication of a 2-dimensional array of p atoms in si for the realization of a silicon based quantum computer .",
    "@xcite a requirement of each of these schemes is that the p atoms , relinquished from the ph@xmath0 molecules , are incorporated into substitutional lattice sites .",
    "since ph@xmath0 is used for doping si in the semiconductor industry , the interaction of ph@xmath4 with the si(001 ) surface has been studied for over two decades using a wide variety of surface sensitive techniques ( e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "it is well established that the adsorption of ph@xmath4 on the si(001 ) surface is partially dissociative , resulting in the adsorption of both ph@xmath4 and ph@xmath5  @xcite moreover , it is known that annealing ph@xmath4 dosed surfaces causes the complete dissociation of the adsorbed ph@xmath4 and ph@xmath6 molecules ( estimates of the temperature at which this occurs vary within the range 300@xmath7c - 425@xmath7c  @xcite ) resulting in the incorporation of p into the surface to form si - p heterodimers .",
    "@xcite the majority of the investigations mentioned above have studied the interaction of phosphine with the si(001 ) surface at high surface coverages . however , at low coverages there are only two papers reporting detailed atomic - resolution scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) investigations of the si(001):ph@xmath4 system , the first by wang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and the second by kipp  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite while the experimental results presented in these two papers are in good agreement , their interpretations are contradictory .    the experimental results from wang  _ et al .",
    "@xcite and kipp  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that after the si(001 ) surface was exposed to a low dose of ph@xmath0 , two types of bright features appeared on the surface .",
    "both features were centered on top of the si dimer rows , with one feature larger than the other .",
    "wang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also observed an increase in the number of dimer vacancies on the surface after ph@xmath0 dosing . in both studies , after the dosed surfaces were annealed ( to 230@xmath7c , ref  ; and to 350@xmath7c ,  ref  ) , the two types of bright feature disappeared from the surface and were replaced by 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) chains running perpendicular to the underlying si dimer rows and a few small 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) islands .",
    "the above data was interpreted by wang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the following way : the larger bright feature was a single si atom ( a monomer ) ejected from the surface and the smaller bright feature was a ph@xmath0 molecule adsorbed on top of a si dimer .",
    "upon heating the surface to 230@xmath3c the si monomers combined to form 1-d rows and small 2-d islands .",
    "this annealing also induced complete ph@xmath0 dissociation , with the p atoms being incorporated into the surface and the h adsorbed onto the surface to form monohydride dimers .",
    "kipp  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a different interpretation of the above data .",
    "they concluded that the large bright features were ph@xmath8 ( n=1 - 3 ) molecules adsorbed at defects and the small bright features were p - p dimers , resulting from the pairing and subsequent dissociation of two ph@xmath0 molecules ( with the dissociated hydrogen atoms also bonding to the surface ) . upon heating the surface to 350@xmath3c kipp  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite concluded that the p - p dimers coalesce to form small chains and islands .",
    "they suggested that the formation of large islands was hindered by the presence of adsorbed h on the surface .",
    "in contrast to the results of wang  _ et al . _ and kipp  _ et al .",
    "_ , separate fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies  @xcite and a combined electron energy loss spectroscopy and thermal programmed desorption study  @xcite have indicated that molecular ph@xmath0 adsorption is accompanied by a partial dissociation of ph@xmath0 to form adsorbed ph@xmath9 and h , during phosphine adsorption at room temperature . therefore , further study of this system is required to consolidate the different interpretations .",
    "we have used high resolution stm and auger electron spectroscopy to study the evolution of a ph@xmath0 dosed si(001 ) surface , as a function of temperature and coverage .",
    "particular emphasis was placed on the process of p incorporation into the si(001 ) surface and the formation of the si - p heterodimer . to this end",
    "we have also performed a study of surface segregated p from a si encapsulated @xmath10-doped layer .",
    "pivotal to these experiments is the ability to resolve the presence of a single p atom in the si(001 ) surface using stm .",
    "we show that the isolated si - p heterodimer appears as a zig - zag feature in filled state stm images , but that the heterodimer is not visible if there is a moderate coverage of monohydrides on the surface .",
    "however , empty state imaging can be used to identify the heterodimers at all coverages .",
    "experiments were performed in ultra - high vacuum ( base pressure @xmath11  mbar ) using an omicron variable temperature stm and electrochemically etched tungsten tips .",
    "the n - type si(001 ) sample had a resistivity of @xmath1 1 @xmath12 cm and was prepared in vacuum by out - gassing overnight at 575@xmath3c using a resistive heater element , followed by flashing to 1175@xmath3c by passing a direct current through the sample .",
    "after flashing , the samples were cooled slowly ( @xmath13@xmath3c / s ) from 900@xmath3c to room temperature . for all anneal steps",
    "the sample temperature was maintained at the stated anneal temperature for 10 seconds unless stated otherwise .",
    "the ph@xmath0 dosing was performed by opening a precision leak valve , which faced the sample , between the uhv chamber and a ph@xmath0 micro - dosing system .",
    "all doses were performed by back - filling the chamber with a 1 @xmath13 10@xmath14 torr pressure of ph@xmath0 and controlling the dose in langmuirs ( 1 l = 10@xmath15 @xmath13 pressure ( torr ) @xmath13 dose ( seconds ) ) via the dose time .",

    "@xcite we assign the fourth feature to be a si ad - dimer , centered on the dimer rows with a height / diameter of 1.3  /13    in the filled state image and a height / diameter of 1.9    /13    in the empty state , in agreement with the observation of si ad - dimers by swartzentruber  @xcite and shown in fig .",

    "@xcite that the feature is a si monomer , since si monomers are not observed in filled state images .",

    "@xcite we therefore conclude , following wang  _ et al .",
    "_ , that the processes that occur as a result of the 350@xmath3c anneal are as follows ; the ph@xmath2 ( x=2,3 ) molecules firstly undergo complete dissociation .",
    "each p atom then undergoes a substitution reaction with one atom of the si surface dimer to form a si - p heterodimer in the plane of the surface , thereby ejecting the displaced si atom onto the surface . at 350@xmath3c",
    "the displaced si atoms are mobile enough to diffuse short distances  @xcite and subsequently form 1-d dimer chains on the surface .",
    "the h atoms liberated from ph@xmath2 dissociation are highly mobile at 350@xmath3c and pair - up to form the energetically favorable monohydride dimers .",
    "@xcite      we have found that the appearance of the si - p heterodimer varies greatly as a function of initial ph@xmath0 coverage . figure  [ doseandheat ] shows a si(001 ) surface after exposure to 2 different doses ( 0.002  l and 0.01  l ) of ph@xmath0 and subsequent annealing of the dosed surfaces to 350@xmath3c and then 500@xmath3c .",

    "after both the lower and higher dosed surfaces have been subject to a further anneal of 500@xmath3c the si chains have now disappeared , see fig .",
    "[ doseandheat](c ) and ( d ) .",

    "[ doseandheat](c ) and 3(d ) , which show the lower and higher dosed surfaces after annealing to 500@xmath3c , the data fits our explanation of the evolution of the ph@xmath0 dosed si(001 ) surface i.e. the more ph@xmath2 ( x=2,3 ) initially adsorbed on the surface , the more si - p heterodimers are observed on the surface after the 500@xmath3c anneal . however , the 350@xmath3c anneals of the lower and higher dosed surfaces are not so easy to understand .",
    "we repeatedly observe that lower dosed , 350@xmath3c annealed surfaces such as that of fig .",
    "[ doseandheat](a ) show moderate densities of si - p heterodimers and monohydrides , as expected .",
    "conversely , the higher dosed , 350@xmath3c annealed surfaces such as that of fig .",
    "[ doseandheat](b ) appear to show a high density of monohydrides and no si - p heterodimers . we know from the 500@xmath3c anneal of the higher dosed surfaces that si - p heterodimers are abundant , so we can conclude that a high density of monohydrides inhibits the observation of si - p heterodimers with the stm .",
    "it is known that monohydride dimers exhibit very little buckling  @xcite and thus pin neighboring si dimers in an unbuckled geometry .",
    "hence , if the density of monohydrides is sufficiently high it is reasonable to assume that almost all the surface si dimers are pinned , even those in the vicinity of si - p heterodimers . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic zig - zag appearance of the si - p heterodimer will be suppressed .",
    "it is now interesting to look again at fig .  [",
    "350a](d ) which was obtained by annealing a buried p layer ( with no h present ) to 600@xmath3c .",
    "whilst a sufficient number of p atoms have diffused to the surface to yield a high density of si - p heterodimers , the surface is free of h. in this image the si - p heterodimers are clearly visible , which is consistent with the observation that it is a high density of monohydrides on the surface that inhibits the stm observation of si - p heterodimers .",
    "our final anneal of the ph@xmath0/si(001 ) low dosed surface ( not shown ) was performed at 700@xmath3c and resulted in the disappearance of the si - p heterodimers . by comparing our results with that from the annealing of",

    "figure  [ dualbias ] shows ( a ) filled- and ( b ) empty - state images of the same area of a si(001 ) sample after a 0.002 l ph@xmath0 dose and a 500@xmath3c anneal .",
    "we have chosen a low ph@xmath0 dose and an anneal temperature sufficiently high that ejected si dimer chains and monohydrides have been completely removed from the surface , so that we can image si - p heterodimers in isolation from other features .",
