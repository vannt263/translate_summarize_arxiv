    "the polytropic model of stellar structure is often introduced in studies of the different stages of stellar evolution . the equation governing the static equilibrium of a polytropic gas sphere",
    "is called the endem equation , whose solution representing the structure of star is known as the endem solution @xcite .",
    "quasi - statical change of stellar structure expressed by the endem solution is believed to describe the evolution of star when the endem solution is dynamically stable .",
    "the dynamical stability is not guaranteed unless the polytropic index @xmath0 is less than 3 @xcite .",
    "a gas sphere of @xmath1 is borderline to the dynamical stability and is also interesting since the polytropic index @xmath2 corresponding to the adiabatic constant @xmath3 .",
    "there are some interesting stellar gases with @xmath3 , such as a radiation pressure dominant gas , an extremely relativistic gas and a gas with degenerate electrons @xcite .",
    "in order to extend the static endem solution to dynamical states , munier and feix derived an explicit self - similar solution which describes a decelerating expansion of a gas sphere of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , another explicit self - similar solution has been obtained to describe a non accelerating nor decelerating expansion ( or contraction ) of a gas sphere of @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper , we present a new dynamical solution for a gas sphere of @xmath1 , which is not self similar in general but includes the three known endem - type solutions described above as special cases .",
    "the new dynamical solution describes such interesting phenomena as a development of a gas sphere from a motion - less state to a state of expansion with a constant speed and a reflection phenomenon in the dynamics of the surface of a sphere .",
    "the equations governing the spherically symmetrical flow of a polytropic gas of adiabatic index @xmath4 under the influence of its own gravitation are    @xmath5    where the pressure @xmath6 , density @xmath7 , radial velocity @xmath8 , gravitational potential @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 are normalized by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 = @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , respectively ; @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and @xmath18 .",
    "the acoustic time scale @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , is set to equal to the time scale of free fall @xmath21 .",
    "the system of eqs .",
    "( [ cont ] ) , ( [ motion ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) admits a following lie point symmetry    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) is derived through the standard procedure .",
    "solving the lie equation associated with the infinitesimal generator ( [ symmetry ] ) , we introduce a new independent variable @xmath25 defined as    @xmath26    and scaled variables    @xmath27    let us make the following ansatz    @xmath28    this ansatz ensures that eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) is satisfied automatically . for @xmath3 , eqs .",
    "( [ motion ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) lead to    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "( [ remotion ] ) and ( [ repoisson ] ) give a modified endem equation for the density profile @xmath31    @xmath32    according to numerical integration of eq.([theta ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath33 , the density profile has the first zero at finite @xmath34 for @xmath35 as shown in figure .",
    "1 . the value of @xmath36 determines the radius of a gas sphere . for @xmath37",
    ", @xmath36 takes the endem s static value @xmath38 .",
    "since the term @xmath39 comes from the inertia term and represents acceleration effect for @xmath40 , we call @xmath30 as the acceleration parameter in this paper . in the acceleration case",
    ", the surface of a gas sphere feels inward inertia force and shrinks from the endem s static value . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the surface feels outward inertia force and expands . at @xmath42",
    ", @xmath36 diverges to infinity and a localized gas sphere disappears .",
    "it is easy to see that eq.([u_relation ] ) takes the following integrable form @xmath43 where @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ u_relation1 ] ) can be integrated once and yields    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is an integration constant . in terms of @xmath47 , the solution ( [ invariant ] )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath48 where @xmath31 is expressed by a localized solution of eq.([theta ] ) while eq.([remotion ] ) gives @xmath49 in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "it is confirmed that the solution ( [ solution ] ) satisfies the boundary condition at the moving surface of sphere .",
    "while the surface is moving with a speed @xmath50 , the flow speed at the surface is given by the same one , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "+ when @xmath52 and @xmath41 , eq.([f_relation ] ) yields    @xmath53    and the solution ( [ solution ] ) becomes identical with the known self - similar solution @xcite . in the absence of the inertia term ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , eq.([theta ] ) reduces to the endem equation . for @xmath52 and @xmath37",
    ", @xmath47 is constant and eq.([solution ] ) gives the static endem solution . for @xmath54 and @xmath37 , eq.([f_relation ] ) gives @xmath55 and eq.([solution ] ) reproduces the expanding endem solution which is expanding with the constant acoustic speed @xcite . for the other values of @xmath30 and @xmath46 , a new class of expanding solution with positive or negative acceleration",
    "is obtained .",
    "since @xmath56 , the acceleration rate of the surface is given by @xmath57 , of which sign is the same as the @xmath30 s sign .    to demonstrate the evolution of the solution ( [ solution ] )",
    ", we consider an initial value problem for eq.([f_relation ] ) such that @xmath58 in order that @xmath59 .",
    "first of all , let us consider the case in which @xmath60 and the acceleration rate of the surface is radially positive .",
    "since @xmath61 as @xmath62 , @xmath63 asymptotically and the surface eventually expands with a constant speed @xmath64 . in this case , we can take a motionless initial condition so that @xmath65 or @xmath66 by choosing the arbitrary ( positive ) constant @xmath46 as @xmath67 .",
    "the expansion speed of the surface ( @xmath68 ) is depicted for @xmath69 in fig.2 .",
    "next , we consider the radially decelerating case ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , where we take @xmath71 as an initial condition so that the initial velocity of the surface is positive",
    ". then , the initially expanding surface gradually decelerates due to the negative inertia term . in this case ,",
    "eq.([f_relation ] ) reads    @xmath72    for @xmath73 , there are no reflection points and the expanding speed of the surface decreases to a constant speed , that is ,    @xmath74    we illustrate the velocity of the surface for @xmath75 and @xmath76 in fig .",
    "+ when @xmath77 , a reflection point appears at @xmath78 .",
    "the deceleration of the surface stops at the reflection point and then the gas sphere began to shrinks .",
    "the reflection time @xmath79 is given as when @xmath70 and @xmath80 , the equation ( [ f_relation ] ) yields    @xmath81    in this reflection case , the velocity of the surface is depicted for @xmath75 and @xmath82 in fig.4 , where @xmath83 .",
    "we present a new dynamical solution for a gas sphere under self - gravity , which not only unifies the three endem - type solutions for the polytropic index @xmath1 but also describes the following interesting phenomena . + for positive values of acceleration parameter @xmath30 , the radius of the gas sphere decreases from the endem s radius due to inward inertia force , while the gas sphere expands for the negative @xmath30 and the distinct surface disappears when @xmath84 .",
    "the new solution also describes acceleration of the surface of a gas sphere from a motion - less state to a state of expansion with a constant speed for the positive @xmath30 and a reflection phenomenon in the dynamics of the surface of a sphere for the negative @xmath30 .",
