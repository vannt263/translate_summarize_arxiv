    "empirical observations of freeway traffic made in various countries show that the onset of congestion in an initial free flow is associated with an abrupt decrease in vehicle speed .",
    "this traffic breakdown called the @xmath0breakdown phenomenon \" occurs mostly at freeway bottlenecks , in particular on - ramp bottlenecks .",
    "the traffic breakdown is accompanied by a hysteresis effect ( see references in the reviews  @xcite , the book  @xcite , and the conference proceedings  @xcite ) .",
    "the breakdown phenomenon has a probabilistic nature  @xcite : at the same on - ramp bottleneck , traffic breakdown is observed at different flow rates in different realizations ( days ) .",
    "the probability of the breakdown is a strong increasing function of flow rate downstream of the bottleneck  @xcite .",
    "most microscopic , macroscopic , probabilistic , and other models of freeway traffic explain the onset of congestion in free flow by moving jam emergence ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references in the reviews  @xcite , as well as the conference proceedings  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in models of an on - ramp bottleneck moving jam(s ) occurs spontaneously in free flow at the bottleneck when the flow rate upstream of the bottleneck is high enough and the flow rate to the on - ramp increases gradually beginning from zero  @xcite .",
    "however , the fundamental model result that the onset of congestion in free flow on a homogeneous road and at freeway bottlenecks is associated with spontaneous moving jam emergence  @xcite is in a serious conflict with empirical evidence  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in 19961999 kerner introduced three - phase traffic theory ( see  @xcite for a review ) . in this theory , there are three traffic phases : free flow , synchronized flow , and wide moving jams . in accordance with empirical investigations of phase transitions , in this theory moving jams do _ not _ emerge spontaneously in free flow .",
    "rather than moving jam emergence , a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow ( f@xmath1s transition for short ) governs the onset of congestion in free flow  @xcite .",

    "given flow rates to the on - ramp @xmath4 and on the main road upstream of the on - ramp @xmath5 random vehicle cluster occurrence and evolution that can lead to traffic breakdown are realized _ only _ after a vehicle precluster consisting of one vehicle randomly appears at the bottleneck .",
    "the rate of precluster emergence is equal to the flow rate to the on - ramp  @xcite : @xmath6 .",
    "this idea about foregoing precluster emergence is associated with a basic model assumption that at @xmath7 no vehicle cluster can randomly appear , specifically no traffic breakdown is possible  @xcite . probably , this basic model assumption leads to the nucleation rate for traffic breakdown that is proportional to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , in real traffic flow both flow rates @xmath4 _ and _ @xmath5 exhibit random fluctuations that can cause cluster emergence .    moreover ,",
    "whereas the basic assumption about the necessity of precluster emergence is physically justified for a homogeneous road  @xcite , this is not the case for for traffic breakdown at the bottleneck .",
    "this is because in contrast with the model of a homogeneous road  @xcite , an initial state of free flow at the bottleneck at @xmath8 and @xmath9 is _ non - homogeneous regardless of fluctuations _  @xcite .",
    "this means that even there were no fluctuations in free flow at the bottleneck , nevertheless free flow is non - homogeneous in a neighborhood of the bottleneck .",
    "this is because two different flows permanent merge within the merging region of the on - ramp  the flow with the rate @xmath4 and the flow with the rate @xmath5 .",
    "it has been shown in three - phase traffic theory  @xcite that due to the merging of these flows a steady state of free flow at the bottleneck is non - homogeneous : a permanent and motionless local perturbation ( deterministic perturbation ) occurs at the bottleneck . within this perturbation that can be considered a deterministic vehicle cluster",
    "the speed is lower and density is greater than downstream of the cluster .",
    "this deterministic cluster can lead to traffic breakdown even if there were _ no _ random fluctuations at the bottleneck  @xcite .",
    "however , in the nucleation model  @xcite the master equation is formulated for probability of a vehicle cluster , which can occur due to fluctuations _",
    "only_. we see that for an initially non - homogeneous traffic flow , which occurs at the bottleneck , another physical approach should be applied .",
    "this is due to at least two reasons mentioned above : ( i ) regardless of fluctuations , there is already a vehicle cluster at the bottleneck that growth can lead to traffic breakdown : no vehicle precluster emerging from fluctuations is necessary for traffic breakdown .",
    "( ii ) when influence of fluctuations on traffic breakdown is considered , fluctuations caused by both flow rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 should be taken into account .    thus , in contrast with the nucleation model at the bottleneck of ref .",
    "@xcite a nucleation model that is adequate with empirical results for traffic breakdown at the bottleneck should consider vehicle cluster evolution in an initially non - homogeneous free traffic .",
    "this random vehicle cluster should include _ both _ the total vehicle number within an initial deterministic cluster _ and _ addition vehicles within the cluster , which occur due to fluctuations .",
    "however , there are no nucleation models and associated probabilistic theories for an initially spatially non - homogeneous free flow . moreover , structure non - homogeneities play also a very important role for phase transitions in many other multiple - particle systems of statistical physics like granular flow , biological physics , reaction - diffusion systems , etc .",
    "( see references , e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it seems important to derive a probabilistic theory for traffic breakdown in non - homogeneous traffic flow .    in this paper , a nucleation model for the probabilistic breakdown phenomenon in an initially spatially non - homogeneous traffic flow at an on - ramp bottleneck",

    "this deceleration leads to a local decrease in speed and consequently to a local increase in density in the vicinity of the bottleneck . as a result , a local perturbation ,",
    "i.e. , non - homogeneity in free flow appears .",
    "if no fluctuations in free flow are considered , as mentioned above the non - homogeneity in free flow in the form of a deterministic local perturbation occurs at the bottleneck .",

    "<S> a nucleation model for the breakdown phenomenon in an initial non - homogeneous free traffic flow that occurs at an on - ramp bottleneck is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this model is in the context of three - phase traffic theory . in this theory , </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown phenomenon is associated with a first - order phase transition from the @xmath0free flow `` phase to the @xmath0synchronized flow '' phase . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with many other nucleation models for phase transitions in different system of statistical physics in which random precluster emergence from fluctuations in an initial homogeneous system foregoes subsequent cluster evolution towards a critical cluster ( critical nuclei ) , random precluster occurrence in free flow at the bottleneck is not necessary for traffic breakdown . in the model , </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown phenomenon can also occur if there were no fluctuations in free flow . </S>",
    "<S> this is because there is a permanent and motionless non - homogeneity that can be considered a deterministic vehicle cluster localized in a neighborhood of the bottleneck . the presented nucleation model and a nucleation rate of traffic breakdown that follows from the model exhibit qualitatively different features in comparison with previous results . in the nucleation model </S>",
    "<S> , traffic breakdown nucleation occurs through a random increase in vehicle number within the deterministic vehicle cluster , if the amplitude of the resulting random vehicle cluster exceeds some critical amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the mean time delay and the associated nucleation rate of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck are found and investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleation rate of traffic breakdown as a function of the flow rates to the on - ramp and upstream of the bottleneck is studied . </S>",
    "<S> boundaries for traffic breakdown in the diagram of congested patterns at the bottleneck are found . </S>",
    "<S> these boundaries are qualitatively correlated with numerical results of simulation of microscopic traffic flow models in the context of three - phase traffic theory .    and </S>"
