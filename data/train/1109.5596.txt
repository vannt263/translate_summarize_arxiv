    "moreover , denote the set of spanning cycles contained in a triangulation @xmath23 by @xmath45 , so @xmath46 .",
    "any spanning cycle ( or , for that matter , any plane graph ) is contained in at least one triangulation .",
    "therefore , we can upper bound the number of spanning cycles of a set @xmath7 of @xmath0 points in the plane by going over every triangulation @xmath47 and counting the number of spanning cycles contained in @xmath23 .",
    "this implies the bound @xmath48 . applying the bounds",
    "@xmath49 from @xcite and @xmath50 from @xcite , we obtain @xmath51 .",
    "this bounding method seems rather weak since it potentially counts some spanning cycles many times .",

    "garca , noy , and tejel @xcite show that such a spanning cycle is contained in @xmath52 triangulations of its point set .",
    "therefore , the above method will count this spanning cycle @xmath52 times .",
    "however , as stated in @xcite , this point set has only @xmath53 spanning cycles .    in order to deal with this inefficiency ,",
    "we define the notion of _ support _ ( the same notion was also used in @xcite ) . given a plane edge graph @xmath39 embedded over a set @xmath7 of points in the plane , we say that @xmath39 has a support of @xmath54 if @xmath39 is contained in ( exactly ) @xmath54 triangulations of @xmath7 ; we write @xmath55 . notice that @xmath56 because every spanning cycle @xmath57 contributes exactly one to the right side of the equation ( it appears in @xmath58 terms of the first sum , and contributes @xmath59 in every appearance ) .",

    "such an operation is depicted in figure [ fi : flip](a ) , where the edge @xmath61 can be flipped to the edge @xmath60 .    in @xcite , we present the concept of _ pseudo simultaneously flippable edges _ ( or _ ps - flippable edges _ , for short ) . given a triangulation @xmath23 , we say that a subset @xmath62 of its edges is a set of ps - flippable edges if the edges of @xmath62 are diagonals of interior - disjoint convex polygons ( whose boundaries are also parts of @xmath23 ) . for example , in figure [ fi : flip](b ) , the three dashed edges form a set of ps - flippable edges , since they are diagonals of interior - disjoint convex quadrilateral and convex pentagon ( another set of ps - flippable edges , in a different triangulation , is depicted in figure [ fi : flip](c ) ) .",
    "ps - flippable edges are related to _",
    "convex decompositions_. a convex decomposition of a point set @xmath7 is a crossing - free straight - edge graph @xmath63 on @xmath7 such that ( i ) @xmath63 includes all the hull edges , ( ii ) each bounded face of @xmath63 is a convex polygon , and ( iii ) no point of @xmath7 is isolated in @xmath63 .",

    "thus , finding a large set of ps - flippable edges in a triangulation @xmath23 is equivalent to finding a convex decomposition with a small number of faces ( or edges ) in @xmath23 .    in @xcite",

    "[ le : psflip ] every triangulation @xmath23 over a set of @xmath0 points in the plane contains a set @xmath62 of @xmath65 ps - flippbale edges . also , there are triangulations with no larger sets of ps - flippable edges .",

    "sketch consider the set @xmath69 of @xmath67 ps - flippable edges .",

    ", we refer to vertices with valid triples as _ valid _ ( with respect to @xmath39 ) , and to the other interior vertices as _ non - valid_.    [ le : validtri ] let @xmath7 be a set of points in the plane and let @xmath39 be a crossing - free straight - edge graph over @xmath7 that contains all the edges of the convex hull of @xmath7 .",

    "an interior vertex @xmath80 is a reflex vertex of some face of @xmath39 if and only if @xmath80 is non - valid ( an example is depicted in figure [ fi : valid](a ) ) .",
    "the lemma follows by observing that @xmath39 is a convex decomposition if and only if no bounded face of @xmath39 has a reflex vertex .      our analysis ,",
    "as most of the previous works dealing with the number spanning cycles , heavily relies on the number of plane perfect matchings on @xmath7 ( for example , see @xcite ) . to see the connection between the two problems ,",
    "notice that if @xmath81 is even , every spanning cycle @xmath57 is the union of two edge - disjoint perfect matchings on @xmath7 ; namely , the matching consisting of the even - indexed edges of @xmath57 , and the matching consisting of the odd - indexed edges .",

    "we also set @xmath84 .",
    "hence , a simple upper bound on @xmath85 is @xmath86 . in general , the union of two edge - disjoint perfect matchings is not always a spanning cycle , but it is a cover of @xmath7 by vertex - disjoint even - sized cycles .    to deal with point sets of odd size",
    ", we use the following lemma :    [ le : even ] let @xmath87 be a constant such that every set @xmath7 of an even number of points in the plane satisfies @xmath88",
    ". then @xmath88 also holds for sets @xmath7 of an odd number of points .",
    "consider a set @xmath7 of @xmath0 points in the plane , where @xmath0 is odd .",

    "then there exists an edge @xmath90 of @xmath57 such that @xmath75 can be connected to the two endpoints @xmath91 of @xmath92 without crossing @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , this is a projective variant of the property , noted in @xcite , that every finite collection of non - crossing straight segments in the plane contains a segment @xmath92 such that no other segment lies vertically above any point of @xmath92 ( see also ( * ? ? ? * section 8.7 ) ) . by replacing @xmath92 with the edges @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ", we obtain a crossing - free spanning cycle of @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that we can map every spanning cycle of @xmath7 to a distinct spanning cycle of @xmath95 , and thus , @xmath96 .",
    "the lemma then follows since @xmath97 .    bounding the number of perfect matchings on @xmath7 within a fixed triangulation @xmath23",

    "we start with @xmath107 and add all the missing hull edges ; let us denote the resulting graph as @xmath109 . by lemma [ le : validtri ] , it suffices to ensure that every interior point @xmath73 is connected in @xmath63 to ( at least ) three points @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 is inside the convex hull of @xmath76 .",
    "every interior vertex @xmath75 of @xmath7 has degree 1 in @xmath109 , so we start by setting @xmath110 , and then , for each interior point @xmath111 , we add to @xmath63 two additional edges of @xmath23 adjacent to @xmath75 , so as to create a valid triple .",
    "to do so , let @xmath92 be the edge of @xmath109 ( that is , of @xmath107 ) incident to @xmath75 , and let @xmath112 be the ray emanating from @xmath75 in the opposite direction .",

    "the triangulation @xmath23 contains @xmath117 interior edges , and @xmath63 contains at most @xmath118 interior edges ( at most @xmath119 edges of @xmath107 and @xmath120 added edges to form @xmath121 valid triples ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath122 * remark .",
    "* note the strength of this bound : lemma [ le : psflip ] has a rather involved proof , given in @xcite , and it yields a set of @xmath65 ps - flippable edges in the entire triangulation .",
    "in contrast , here we get the same number ( minus 1 ) after we remove from @xmath23 an arbitrary perfect matching , with a considerably simpler analysis .",
    "thus the significance of the analysis in @xcite ( involving lemma [ le : psflip ] ) is only for triangulations which contain no perfect matching on @xmath7 .",

    "we now proceed to bound the number of ways to choose the second matching @xmath124 while taking the supports of the resulting graphs @xmath125 into account .",

    "<S> we derive improved upper bounds on the number of crossing - free straight - edge spanning cycles ( also known as hamiltonian tours and simple polygonizations ) that can be embedded over any specific set of @xmath0 points in the plane . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we bound the ratio between the number of spanning cycles ( or perfect matchings ) that can be embedded over a point set and the number of triangulations that can be embedded over it . </S>",
    "<S> the respective bounds are @xmath1 for cycles and @xmath2 for matchings . </S>",
    "<S> these imply a new upper bound of @xmath3 on the number of crossing - free straight - edge spanning cycles that can be embedded over any specific set of @xmath0 points in the plane ( improving upon the previous best upper bound @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on kasteleyn s linear algebra technique . </S>"
