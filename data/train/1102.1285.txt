    "the rapid progress over the past two decades in the area of ultrafast optics has led to the production , manipulation and control of pulses with durations down to a few optical cycles ( see , e.g. , the comprehensive review @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical and experimental studies of few - cycle pulses ( fcps ) have opened the door to a series of applications in various fields such as light matter interaction , high - order harmonic generation , extreme nonlinear optics @xcite , and attosecond physics @xcite . on the theoretical arena",
    "three classes of main dynamical models for fcps have been put forward : ( i ) the quantum approach @xcite , ( ii ) the refinements within the framework of the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) of the nonlinear schrdinger - type envelope equations @xcite , and non - svea models @xcite . in media with cubic ( kerr - type ) optical nonlinearity the physics of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional fcps can be adequately described beyond the svea by using different dynamical models , such as the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) @xcite , sine - gordon ( sg ) @xcite , or mkdv - sg equations @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to notice that the physics of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional fcps is well described by the generic mkdv - sg equation @xcite ; this quite general model was also derived and studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another class of conceptually important optical problems for which the svea approach does not apply in the femtosecond regime includes multidimensional spatiotemporal optical solitons ( alias  light bullets \" ) , formed by the competing diffraction , dispersion , and quadratic @xcite or cubic @xcite nonlinearity .",
    "thus for the adequate description of multidimensional fcps , a non - integrable generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation @xcite ( a two - dimensional version of the mkdv model ) was introduced for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional few - optical - cycle spatiotemporal soliton propagation in _",
    "cubic _ nonlinear media beyond the svea  @xcite .",
    "recently , by using a powerful reductive perturbation technique @xcite , or a multiscale analysis , a generic kp evolution equation governing the propagation of femtosecond spatiotemporal optical solitons in _",
    "quadratic _ nonlinear media beyond the svea was also put forward @xcite .",
    "transparency of the medium is obviously required by soliton propagation .",
    "it implies that all transition frequencies of the medium are far from the typical frequency of the wave",
    ". they can be either well above or well below the latter .",
    "as shown in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite , a wave frequency much lower than the resonance frequency corresponds to a long wave approximation and to a mkdv model , while a wave frequency much higher than it corresponds to a short wave approximation and a sg model .",
    "later , a generic mkdv - sg model has been derived for the case of two transition lines , one well above , and the other one well below the wave frequency @xcite , and is the most general non - svea model proposed to describe fcp propagation in kerr media @xcite .",
    "it is expected to remain valid in the general case , where two sets of resonance lines are present instead of two single transitions .",
    "our ultimate goal is to generalize the generic mkdv - sg model to ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "however , both long- and short wave approximations for a simple two - level model have not yet been rigorously derived .",
    "it might be relevant to consider the full set of atomic levels , and it would be necessary in order to compute the nonlinear coefficients in a quantitative way .",
    "however , as a preliminary approach and for the sake of tractability , we need to consider a simplified model , but a natural question arises , why we consider a two - level model and not , e.g. , a four - level one ? as written above , it has been previously shown @xcite that if we consider only two separate transitions , one with resonance frequency below the optical range , and the second one above it , the fcp propagation is considerably affected .",
    "the most relevant refinement of the two - level model is thus a @xmath0 level one .",
    "our preliminary computations for the model of two sets of two levels show that in the long wave approximation considered in the present work , both the dispersive and the nonlinear coefficients merely sum up .",
    "in fact , we expect that the model equation obtained for the complete model with arbitrary number of levels , when all resonance lines are well above the wave frequency , has the same form as the one derived for the two - level model , only with modified values of nonlinear coefficients . however , this is not the case when the resonance line is well below the wave frequency , since the pulse evolution involves the difference of populations between the levels in a nonlinear way .",
    "in this situation , we expect a more complicated evolution equation for fcps when more than two levels are involved .",
    "this general model , which might be , in our opinion , the most relevant correction to the two - level model , is left for further investigation . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - level system has many interesting features by itself : it is in some sense equivalent to a classical oscillator , as can be shown from the computation of the nonlinear susceptibilities @xcite , or from the derivation of the kdv model for fcps propagation in quadratic nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "moreover , estimations of the value of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath1 drawn from the classical model have shown a very good agreement with experimental data , as , e.g. , in the case of the model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus there are three main issues which deserve to be investigated : the first one , which constitutes the aim of the present manuscript , is the long - wave approximation leading to the cubic generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili ( cgkp ) equation , which yields collapse .",
    "the second and the third worth studying open problems are , respectively , the short wave approximation and the investigation of the full model with both mkdv and sg terms . on this ground , we consider that the study of the cgkp model , including the derivation of the cgkp equation from a two - level model , is an important step in the adequate description of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional fcps .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive and to study a cubic generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili partial differential equation , which describes the dynamics of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spatiotemporal pulses in cubic nonlinear media beyond the svea model equations , starting from the maxwell - bloch equations for a set of two - level atoms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the generic cgkp equation and we study by adequate numerical methods the propagation dynamics , the nonlinear difraction and , in the case of anomalous dispersion , the collapse of ultrashort spatiotemporal pulses .",
    "we calculate in sec .",
    "iii the collapse threshold for the propagation of ultrashort spatiotemporal pulses described by the cgkp equation by both a direct numerical method and by an analytical method , which is based on a rigorous virial theorem . in sec .",
    "iv , the evolution of the spectrum ( integrated over the transverse coordinate ) is given and a strongly asymmetric spectral broadening of ultrashort pulses during collapse is put into evidence .",
    "section v presents our conclusions .",
    "for a kerr ( cubic ) medium a cgkp equation can be derived from maxwell - bloch equations using the powerful reductive perturbation method @xcite . as said in the introduction",
    ", we consider a set of two - level atoms with the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the frequency of the transition .",
    "the evolution of the electric field @xmath4 is described by the wave equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the polarization density .",
    "the light propagation is coupled with the medium by means of a dipolar electric momentum @xmath7 directed along the same direction @xmath8 as the electric field , according to @xmath9 and the polarization density @xmath6 along the @xmath8-direction is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volume density of atoms and @xmath12 the density matrix .",

    "this motivates the introduction of the slow variables @xmath16 @xmath17 being a small parameter .",
    "the delayed time @xmath18 involves propagation at some speed @xmath19 to be determined .",
    "it is assumed to vary slowly in time according to the assumption @xmath20 .",
    "the pulse shape described by the variable @xmath18 evolves even more slowly in time , the corresponding scale being that of variable @xmath21 .",
    "the transverse spatial variable @xmath22 has an intermediate scale as usual in kp - type expansions @xcite .",
    "next we use the reductive perturbation method as developed in ref . @xcite . to this aim",
    "we expand the electric field @xmath4 as power series of a small parameter @xmath17 : @xmath23 as in the standard mkdv - type expansions  @xcite .",
    "a weak amplitude assumption is needed in order that the nonlinear effects arise at the same propagation distance scale as the dispersion does , which justifies that the expansion of @xmath4 begins at order @xmath17 .",

    "the coefficients of the rk4etd scheme are computed by means of series expansions , to avoid catastrophic consequences of limited numerical accuracy .",

    "the threshold @xmath80 found numerically is about half of this value @xmath77 , found using the assumptions of the above mentioned virial theorem , which is consistent with the well - known fact that the conditions of the theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite , especially @xmath72 , yield only a sufficient condition .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 will be referred to below as the ` analytical threshold for collapse ' for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , it is likely that this condition is optimal for an input which has a shape adapted to the collapse process .",
    "on the basis of this idea and of the numerical results , the discrepancy can be physically interpreted as follows .",
    "figure [ momy ] presents the evolution of the width @xmath81 of the pulse against propagation distance @xmath82 , for a few initial values of input amplitude @xmath26 ( see eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) ) . the width @xmath81 is numerically computed according to : @xmath83 it is seen that self - focusing occurs in every case presented in fig .",
    "4 . however , for initial amplitude below threshold @xmath55 , the self - focusing stops after a while and the collapse is inhibited .",
    "this feature is due to the dispersion ( both linear and nonlinear ) , which tends to increase the temporal length of the pulse at the same time as it self - focuses . below the threshold ,",
    "the dispersion dominates and collapse is prevented , while above the threshold , self - focusing dominates and collapse occurs .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the arrest of collapse due to dispersion was already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this observation may justify qualitatively the discrepancy between the analytic and numerical thresholds for collapse found above",
    ". between the two values for threshold ( @xmath84 ) , at the beginning of the process , the amplitude is not properly speaking sufficient to initiate collapse but , due to the shape of the pulse , a nonlinear lens effect induces a transverse self - focusing of the pulse , which increases the maximal pulse amplitude . at the same time , dispersion ( linear and nonlinear ) occurs , which tends to decrease the amplitude .",
    "if dispersion dominates , the growth of the amplitude stops and collapse does not occur . if , on the contrary , self - focusing dominates , the peak amplitude reaches a value which is sufficient to induce the collapse as such .",
    "notice that in fig .",
    "[ maxu ] , the collapsing curves show two distinct parts , the first one ( oscillating ) corresponds rather to self - focusing and the second one corresponds rather to collapse _",
    "stricto sensu_. the value of the amplitude at the boundary between the two regions is close to the threshold value for collapse ( @xmath85 ) found from the mathematical condition @xmath72 , see eqs .",

    "[ spec_g ] and [ specl_g ] . at the beginning of the evolution process",

    "then the spectrum presents the oscilatory structure typical of the modulation instability ( fig .",
    "[ specl_g]b ) .",
    "however it is strongly asymmetric , in contrast with the case of the ` long ' pulses described within the svea .",
    "finally , a strong broadening of the spectrum is seen as the collapse itself occurs ( fig .",
    "[ specl_g]c ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a model beyond the slowly varying envelope approximation of the comonly used nonlinear schrdinger - type evolution equations , for describing the propagation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spatiotemporal ultrashort optical solitons in kerr ( cubic ) nonlinear media .",
    "our approach is based on the maxwell - bloch equations for an ensemble of two level atoms and on the multiscale approach , and as a result of using the powerful reductive perturbation method @xcite , a generic cubic generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili partial differential evolution equation was put forward .",

    "collapse is evidenced .",
    "the collapse threshold for the propagation of ultrashort spatiotemporal pulses described by the cubic generalized kadomtsev - petviashvili equation was calculated numerically , and compared to the analytical results drawn from a theorem based on a virial method , which proves that collapse occurs .",
    "the discrepancy between the value of the collapse treshold obtained numerically and the corresponding analytical threshold for collapse is qualitatively explained .",
