    "one of the fundamental challenges in realizing optical quantum computation and similar applications of quantum information encoded in photonic qubits is the relative weakness of nonlinear interactions that could couple individual photons . among the many proposals made to overcome this limitation ,",
    "some of the most impressive results have been obtained in cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in particular , the experimental observation of a nonlinear phase shift of 10 degrees reported by turchette et al .",
    "has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which this phase shift is obtained is the saturation of a single two level atom confined in a single mode cavity .",
    "therefore , the phase shift depends on a non - vanishing excitation of the atom and the results obtained for the magnitude of the phase shift should increase as the pump light approaches resonance .",
    "the main limitation of this resonant improvement of the nonlinear phase shift is set by the sensitivity of the cavity transmission and the transversal losses to the atomic resonance .",
    "we therefore propose a reflection geometry with negligible transversal losses as an optimized device for obtaining a nonlinear phase shift sensitive to individual photons @xcite .",
    "with such a device , it should be possible to achieve nonlinear phase shifts of 180 degrees .",
    "the source of the strong nonlinearity observed in cavity quantum electrodynamics is the two level atom that changes its optical properties drastically in its transition from ground state to excited state . in principle , this nonlinear change of the optical response is found in any individual two level system .",
    "however , it is difficult to isolate a single two level atom in such a way that the optical input and output fields can be focussed efficiently on this individual atomic system . for this purpose",
    ", it is convenient to use a resonant cavity with a length equal to half a wavelength . in such a cavity",
    ", it is possible to suppress the coupling of the atom with any mode other than the single resonant cavity mode . as a result ,",
    "all of the light entering the cavity will interact with the atom , and most of the light radiated by the atom will be emitted through the cavity mode .",
    "effectively , it is the purpose of the cavity to focus all the input light on the atom and to guide all the output light to the detectors .",
    "the longitudinal confinement given by the cavity lifetime is not relevant for this purpose .",
    "it is therefore possible to achieve very good results in the bad cavity regime , where the cavity decay rate @xmath0 is much faster than the coupling rate @xmath1 of the field - atom interaction .",
    "figure [ geometry ] illustrates a one sided cavity setup with negligible transversal losses ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "these fields , represented by the input @xmath9 and the output @xmath8 , have a transversal profile defined by the cavity mode .",
    "if the input light and the detectors match this mode profile , maximal interaction with the two level atom is obtained .",
    "the conventional cavity parameters characterizing the field - atom interaction are the cavity damping rate @xmath0 , the atom - field coupling rate @xmath1 , and the loss rate @xmath10 describing the spontaneous emission into non - cavity modes .",
    "however , in the bad cavity regime , the field dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the cavity damping rate and the atom - field coupling then define the rate of emission through the cavity as @xmath11 .",
    "a bad cavity therefore divides the total spontaneous emission of the atom into two parts , one guided by the cavity into a well focussed beam , the other spread out over all directions in three dimensional space .    this situation is also reflected by the equations of motion for the atomic system obtained from the standard equations of cavity quantum electrodynamics by adiabatic elimination of the cavity field . due to the adiabatic elimination ,",
    "these equations are now equivalent to the bloch equations of a single two level atom , @xmath12 in this formulation , the atom dynamics itself depends only on the dipole relaxation rate @xmath13 given by @xmath14 since this dipole relaxation rate is entirely due to spontaneous emission , the total spontaneous emission rate is equal to @xmath15 and the two contributions to @xmath13 can be identified with spontaneous emission through the cavity ( @xmath16 ) and with emission into non - cavity modes ( @xmath17 ) , respectively .",

    "the phase shift reaches its maximum value of 180 degrees at @xmath41 .",
    "the increase from @xmath26 to @xmath28 only increases the off - resonant phase shifts .",
    "the nonlinear change from the weak field response described by equation ( [ eq : weak ] ) to the strong field response given by equation ( [ eq : strong ] ) also includes an increase of the reflected amplitude . for weak fields ,",
    "only a fraction @xmath42 of the input intensity is reflected .",
    "this fraction is given by @xmath43 for strong fields , all of the input light is reflected .",
    "the amplitude nonlinearity is therefore characterized by a change of reflectivity from @xmath42 to one . in order to realize a loss free phase nonlinearity , it is desireable to improve the efficiency @xmath42 to be close to one .",
    "this can be achieved by varying the frequency or by varying the spontaneous emission factor @xmath18 .",
    "however , the previous discussion has shown that high phase shifts can only be achieved close to resonance at high @xmath18 .",
    "the only way to improve efficiency in this regime is to improve the value of @xmath18 by avoiding spontaneous emission into non - cavity modes .    at resonance ,",
    "the efficiency is given by @xmath44 .",
    "for the values of @xmath18 shown in figure [ beta ] , the efficiencies at resonance are therefore equal to @xmath45 for @xmath26 , and equal to @xmath46 for @xmath28 .",
    "the suppression of spontaneous emission to non - cavity modes is therefore important for the realization of a maximally sensitive optical phase switch .",
    "in order to realize a nonlinear phase shift of 180 degrees using the optical properties of a single atom in a cavity , it is necessary to reduce the fraction of spontaneous emission emitted into non - cavity modes below @xmath47 . it is then possible to obtain the desired phase shift at resonance with the atom .",
    "however , losses make a further improvement towards @xmath48 desireable . in principle , a completely loss free nonlinear phase flip of 180 degrees can be achieved if all the light emitted from the atom is confined by the cavity at @xmath48 @xcite .",
