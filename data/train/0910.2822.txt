    "a three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator ( ti ) is a time - reversal invariant system with bulk gap but support massless dirac fermions with coupled spin and momentum on the surface.@xcite the existence and the ( odd ) number of dirac cones of the massless dispersion are protected by the @xmath4 topology of the bulk band structure.@xcite recent first principle calculation reveals that sb@xmath2te@xmath3 , bi@xmath2te@xmath3 and bi@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals are potential topological insulators.@xcite quite excitingly angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments have confirmed many of the proposed topological insulators.@xcite before harvesting the novel properties of tis,@xcite an interesting question is how robust the surface dirac fermions are against imperfections , such as local and extended impurities .",

    "therefore the upper terrace effectively experience a hard wall on the left . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower terrace can be obtained by coupling a surface to an isolated upper - right layer through @xmath80 .",
    "thus the lower terrace effectively experiences a soft boundary on the right .",
    "the asymmetry clearly follows from the difference in the effective scattering mechanism , and makes it more sensible to define the origin of @xmath44 as the boundary of such scattering in figs.[figldoslinecut](a ) and ( b ) .",

    "the long thick arrow indicates a scattering process that conserves @xmath74 in the case of a domainwall with its normal direction along the @xmath130-axis , and @xmath126 is the incident angle .",
    "[ figscatter ] , width=321 ]    clearly the factor of @xmath131 in @xmath132 follows from the requirement of spin overlap @xmath133 during elastic scattering , as illustrated in fig.([figscatter ] ) .",

    "more importantly , @xmath135 in the unitary limit @xmath105 ( a hard wall ) for all values of @xmath74 , and consequently in the real space @xmath136 as long as @xmath137 .",

    "this surprising result indicates that the klein paradox also works in 2d but only for a hard wall .    for general strength of @xmath140 ( or soft walls ) , the asymptotic behavior in the limit of @xmath141 ( where a saddle point approximation is valid ) is given by g(x ) & & = g_q(x ) + & & ~e^-2|_nx|,where @xmath127 is used . upon analytical continuation @xmath142 ,",

    "qualitatively this is due to the fact that surface dirac fermions are not completely confined on the surface .",
    "depending on the planar momentum the wave function has varying extent of amplitude on the surface .",
    "therefore the impurity is only partially seen by the surface dirac fermions .",
    "moreover , they exist only in a limited regime in the momentum space .",

    "so the ldos oscillation decays as @xmath159 near a local impurity in a 2d metal.@xcite    similar analysis could be proceeded for 3d dirac fermions in the presence of 2- , 1- and 0-dimensional impurities . as the impurity states would not be easily probed by stm",
    ", we do not go into detailed analysis .",
    "some interesting behaviors are as follows .",
    "first , a 2d hard wall does not lead to any oscillation in ldos away from the wall .",
    "for lower - dimension or general scalar impurities the oscillation is present , and decays faster than that for normal metals by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "we analyze the behavior of surface states of topological insulators against local and extended impurities . using an effective 3d lattice model",
    "we first obtain the spectral function of the surface states .",

    "we then study the effects of a local impurity and a terrace on the surface .",
    "away from a local impurity , the spatial oscillation in ldos below the bulk gap @xmath5 is much weaker than that above @xmath5 .",
    "the ldos oscillation is globally weak on the lower terrace . while on the upper terrace , the ldos oscillation is barely visible below @xmath5 , in perfect agreement with the stm measurement , but it is significant above @xmath5 .",
    "the asymmetry of the ldos oscillation on the lower and upper terraces is attributed to the difference in the effective scattering mechanism . from the ldos oscillations we extract the modulation wave number @xmath7 as a function of energy @xmath6 .",
    "the dispersion ( @xmath6 vs. @xmath9 ) follows that of dirac fermions for @xmath8 , but it follows the border of the bulk continuum for @xmath10 .",
    "the numerical results combine to reveal that the surface dirac fermions are rather immune to the imperfections .",
    "we discuss such a behavior analytically by pure dirac models . because of a cancellation due to the alignment of momentum and spin polarization ,",
    "the @xmath7 oscillation in ldos , if present , decays asymptotically faster by a factor of @xmath11 than that for usual fermions .",
    "specifically , the oscillation is absent for a hard domain wall .",
    "such behaviors are consistent with the 3d lattice model .",
    "we also find and discuss differences between surface and pure dirac fermions .    before closing , some remarks are in order .",
    "first , our simple model does not yield wavy energy shells ( in the momentum space ) for surface dirac fermions due to warping terms , which would arise if longer - range hopping are considered .",
    "the warping term produces partial nesting and is responsible for fine features in bi@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "however , the merit of our simple model is it uncovers material - independent qualitative difference between surface dirac fermions and bulk continuum .",
    "a material - dependent calculation will be provided elsewhere .",
    "second , we notice that a real terrace edge is not likely a straight line .",
    "this may be mapped to a straight edge but with excess impurities nearby .",
    "according to our results of both local impurity and terrace , a wiggling terrace edge should also lead to visible oscillations below the bulk gap , consistent with experiments.@xcite finally , in a model with multiple dirac cones for the surface states , elastic scattering between cones is not suppressed by the chirality , and is therefore expected to induce visible ldos oscillations even below the bulk gap .",
