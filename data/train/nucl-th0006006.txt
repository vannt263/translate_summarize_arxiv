    "the advances made at radioactive nuclear beam facilities provide us with an increasing amount of information on nuclei far away from the stability line .",
    "we now have access to experimental measurements of the masses , radii and deformations of unstable nuclei in a wider region of the nuclear chart than ever before .",
    "studies of exotic nuclei have revealed new features , such as neutron halos@xcite and neutron skins@xcite and bring new perspectives to nuclear physics@xcite . planned facilities around the world plan to study unstable nuclei up to the r - process region or even beyond .",
    "this will enable us to investigate where and how exotic phenomena of nuclear structure appear in the region far from the stability line@xcite .",
    "in recent years relativistic many - body theories have been applied to nuclei and nuclear matter with remarkable success@xcite .",
    "the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) theory has been shown capable of reproducing the saturation properties of nuclear matter using interaction parameters that describe the two - nucleon bound state and scattering@xcite . its phenomenological version , the relativistic mean field model ( rmf ) , has been successfully applied to the description of many of the ground - state properties of stable and unstable nuclei and has been shown capable of simultaneously reproducing the properties of stable and unstable nuclei over a wide mass range of the periodic table@xcite .",
    "the relativistic mean field approach has also been applied to describe the structure of very exotic nuclei . in these calculations ,",
    "the pairing interaction has been neglected or simply treated by a nonrelativistic bcs type of approximation@xcite . for nuclei on or near the stability line",
    ", the bcs approach provides a reasonably good description of pairing properties .",
    "however , for drip - line nuclei , the fermi level is close to the continuum and the coupling between bound and continuum states should be taken into account explicitly .",
    "the pairing correlations and the mean fields should be calculated simultaneously in order to obtain an accurate description of the ground state properties of drip - line nuclei .    a more precise relativistic description of pairing correlations , a dirac - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( dhfb ) approximation ,",
    "was developed some time ago@xcite and , more recently , applied to nuclear matter calculations@xcite .",
    "the first calculations in nuclear matter furnished pairing gaps much larger than those obtained in nonrelativistic calculations using realistic interactions.@xcite the results suggested that the meson - exchange interactions adjusted to describe nuclear matter saturation might not be adequate for the particle - particle pairing channel .",
    "however , these calculations did not perform a complete self - consistent dhfb calculation . rather , they combined a relativistic hartree mean field calculation with a nonrelativistic calculation of the pairing field using the nonrelativistic reduction of the meson - exchange potential .",
    "self - consistent calculations including the full dirac structure of the self - energy and pairing fields resulted in more reasonable values for the pairing gap.@xcite yet these dhfb calculations , using various sets of meson - exchange parameters that furnish similar good descriptions of nuclear saturation , still resulted in values of the pairing gap that were not consistent with nonrelativistic calculations nor consistent among themselves . in ref .",
    ", these discrepancies were resolved by associating the pairing gap of each set of meson - exchange parameters with the set s description of low - energy two - nucleon scattering in the @xmath1s@xmath2 channel . when each of the parameter sets was supplemented with a momentum cutoff , so that they each described the two - nucleon @xmath1s@xmath2 virtual state correctly , they all provided consistent values for the pairing gap that very close to the nonrelativistic ones , at low densities .",
    "thus , the conclusion of ref .   was found to be correct afterall .",
    "the meson - exchange interactions adjusted to describe nuclear matter saturation are indeed inadequate for the pairing channel , when they do not describe the two - nucleon @xmath1s@xmath2 channel well . in the case of nuclear matter , however , we have found that this inadequacy can be easily remedied .    even after the different sets of meson - exchange parameters have been augmented so as to describe the two - nucleon @xmath1s@xmath2 channel , they still differ slightly among themselves at densities greater than about one - eight of the saturation density , where mean field effects begin to play a role .",
    "most importantly , they all differ in a consistent manner from the gap functions obtained using realistic nonrelativistic two - nucleon interactions .",
    "the relativistic pairing gap consistently falls to zero at lower density ( by about one - half ) of that for which it disappears in nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "much as the dirac structure of the nuclear mean field weakens the effective interaction as the density increases , leading to saturation , so the dirac structure of the pairing field weakens the effective pairing interaction with density , leading to the suppression of the pairing field relative to the nonrelativistic one .",
    "an estimate of the relativistic effects on quasi - deuteron pairing shows that the same effects also suppress quasi - deuteron pairing at the saturation density@xcite .",
    "we thus expect a density - dependent suppression of the pairing field to be a general feature when we take the dirac structure of the field into account .",
    "the relativistic hartree mean field + nonrelativistic pairing field approximation of ref .",
    "can and has been extended to finite nuclei .",
    "this hybrid relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) approximation , using a non - relativistic finite - range gogny interaction in the pairing channel , has been applied extensively , and quite successfully , to the calculation of the ground state properties of spherical@xcite and deformed nuclei@xcite .",
    "we would expect reasonable results from such a model as long as the mean field is well described by the meson exchange interaction and the @xmath1s@xmath2 two - nucleon channel is well described by the effective pairing interaction .",
    "this is indeed the case in the references cited here .",
    "however , we might expect its pairing interaction to be less reliable than a meson - exchange one when extrapolated far beyond the stability valley , the condition for which its parameters have been adjusted .    aside from simply being more pleasing aesthetically ,",
    "we are motivated to retain the dirac structure of the pairing interaction in our calculations by the success of our studies of @xmath1s@xmath2 pairing in nuclear matter and by their differences from the nonrelativistic results .",
    "the success of our nuclear matter calculations lead us to believe that a good description of nuclei can be obtained using a dirac pairing interaction based on a meson - exchange one .",
    "such a description would be of general interest , since the dirac structure of a meson - exchange interaction could be extended beyond the valley of stability with better reliability than could a nonrelativistic interaction .",
    "a nonrelativistic effective interaction must incorporate the density dependence furnished by the dirac structure of a meson - exchange interaction into its effective parameters .",
    "this density dependence changes as we consider nuclei further and further from the stability valley , thus limiting the range of application of a effective interaction adjusted to describe the conditions in the valley .",
    "the differences between our results and nonrelativistic ones in nuclear matter suggest that interesting effects of the dirac structure of the pairing interaction might appear even in nuclei within the stability valley .",
    "the suppression of pairing in the saturated interior region , in dhfb calculations , similar to that observed in nuclear matter , would result in greater localization of the pairing field on the nuclear surface than is the case in nonrelativistic or rhb calculations .",
    "this , in turn , would tend to make the nucleus more rigid and tend to diminish its deformation .",
    "we then would expect to observe a smaller pairing field in dhb calculations that furnish the same deformation as nonrelativistic or rhb ones , or a smaller deformation in dhb calculations that furnish the same value of the pairing field as nonrelativistic or rhb ones .    here",
    "we present a fully relativistic dirac - hartree - bogoliubov ( dhb ) approximation for axially deformed nuclei .",
    "we use a direct extension of the dhfb approximation developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we neglect the exchange term in the self - energy but retain the dirac structure of the pairing interaction and pairing field .",
    "the neglect of the exchange term seems a reasonable approximation here , as we restrict our calculations to the exchange of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , for which the exchange effects can be fairly well accomodated by adjustments in the coupling constants .",
    "the characteristics of the pairing field and of its dirac structure will form the center of our study . our goal is to extend our successful dhfb description of nuclear matter to a dhb description of finite nuclei .",
    "we use a local ( zero - range ) approximation to the meson - exchange interaction in the pairing channel . a zero - range approximation to the pairing interaction",
    "can be justified by an analysis of the length scales in a typical dhb calculation .",
    "taking oscillator wave functions as a guide , we can estimate the wavelength in one dimension of a wave function of quantum number @xmath6 ( in that dimension ) as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the oscillator length , @xmath9 fm , and @xmath10 is the mass number of the nucleus . in the fairly extreme case of the n=16 shell of @xmath11o",
    ", we find a wavelength of @xmath12 fm . the wavelength is larger in heavier nuclei or in lower shells .",
    "on the other hand , the range of a typical meson - exchange interaction is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the meson mass .",
    "for the lightest of the mesons that we include , the @xmath3 meson , we find a range of @xmath15 fm , substantially smaller than the wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "even the term of longest range of the gogny interaction has @xmath17 fm only .",
    "thus we find that the interaction range is typically smaller than the length scale of the most energetic level , making the effects due to the finite range of the interaction small .",
    "this analysis has , in fact , been confirmed numerically by meng@xcite , who found zero - range and finite - range gogny rhb calculations to yield almost identical results .    in section",

    "the rhb calculations of ref .",

    "if we were to increase the magnitude of the pairing field in our calculations , the resulting deformations would be smaller than those of the rhb ( and other ) calculations .",
    "this discrepancy is an indication of the relativistic effects of the dirac pairing field that were discussed in the introduction .",
    "there , we suggested that the dirac structure of the pairing field should result in its being more localized on the nuclear surface and , thus , more effective in limiting the deformation .",
    "as the dirac structure of the pairing field is the principal difference between our calculations and the rhb ones , our results lend support to this argument .",
    "nuclei in the region of the @xmath244 subshell closure present interesting variations in deformation as they deviate from the neutron magic number @xmath290 on either side of the stability line .",
    "studies of their level schemes and lifetimes have shown that the ground - state properties of these nuclei are very sensitive to small changes in the proton and neutron number@xcite .",
    "strontium isotopes present two regions ( @xmath291 and @xmath292 ) of very strong deformations , as large as @xmath293 .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the e2 + measurements as well as in the isotope shifts .",
    "the rapid transition from a spherical shape near the @xmath0=50 shell closure to a strongly deformed one can be explained by the reinforcement of the shell gaps in the single - particle levels for protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "for krypton isotopes , on the other hand , the expected change in shape at @xmath294 , which occurs for most elements in the @xmath295 region , does not appear .",
    "instead , the isotope shifts show a pronounced slope change at @xmath290 .",
    "the fact that a strongly deformed ground state does not appear at @xmath294 has been attributed to a reduced proton - neutron interaction at @xmath296 .",
    "theoretical studies of these nuclei have been carried out using both relativistic and non - relativistic frameworks .",
    "bonche et al.@xcite studied these isotopes extensively including triaxial deformations in the non - relativistic hartree - fock with a skyrme siii force , which resulted in a linear trend for the isotope shifts .",
    "they also used the method of generator coordinates for sr isotopes and predicted a transition from a spherical to a deformed shape .",
    "however , the isotope shifts could not be reproduced in any of those calculations .",
    "many studies using the relativistic mean field approach have been performed in this region .",
    "early calculations employed the parameter set nl1 , which has a very large asymmetry energy and does not describe the isotope shifts well @xcite . in ref .",
    ", however , lalazissis and sharma successfully described the ground state properties of the sr and kr isotopes , by applying the rmf approach with the nlsh parameter set for the mean field lagrangian and the bcs formalism for the pairing correlations .",
    "the deviations of the binding energies from the experimental data were the on order of 0.5% and the deformation parameters @xmath278 were in good agreement with the @xmath297 values extracted from b(e2 ) measurements .",
    "it is therefore of interest to perform calculations of the sr and kr isotopes using the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov approach in those regions and compare the results with the experimental data .",
    "we begin by studying the dependence of the binding energy on the quadrupole deformation parameter , @xmath278 , using the method described in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , we present the total binding energy as a function of the deformation @xmath278 of the nucleus @xmath245sr , for three values of the parameter @xmath193 . the most singular difference between the three curves",
    "is the change of the absolute minimum , from a prolate shape in the case of @xmath298 to an oblate one for @xmath299 , remaining oblate for @xmath300 .",
    "the energy difference between the two minima is quite small and the oblate minimum becomes deeper relative to the prolate one as @xmath193 increases . for @xmath298 , the prolate",

    "if we take the oblate solution as the absolute minimum , the value of the deformation parameter agrees well with the experimental value of @xmath301 .",
    "we performed calculations for possible minima of both prolate and oblate shapes of most of the known even nuclei in the kr and sr isotopic chains .",
    "we found many nuclei for which the two minima have very similar binding energies , an indication of shape coexistence or of a triaxial ground state deformation .",

    "[ fig17 ] , for three values of @xmath193 . to prepare this figure ,",
    "we have selected the solution , among the multiple minima of each isotope , that has the deepest ( absolute ) minimum .",
    "we compare our results with the mller - nix systematics and the audi - wapstra compilation .",
    "we find the calculations to agree quite well with both of these . as in the previous cases , the calculated two - neutron separation energies are fairly insensitive to the parameter @xmath193 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] , we display the mean value of the neutron gap parameter @xmath302 of the even mass kr and sr isotopes , as a function of the mass number , for the same three values of @xmath193 .",
    "we find the best agreement with the mller - nix and audi - wapstra values to be given by the calculations using @xmath300 .",
    "the shell closure at @xmath290 is clearly visible as a zero in the calculated pairing gap of both isotopoic chains .    in table",
    "ii , we present the results for the total binding energy and the deformation parameter @xmath278 obtained in the present calculations , for @xmath193=0.58 , together with the experimental data .",
    "the value @xmath193=0.58 furnishes the best description of the total binding energies and of the mean value of the neutron pairing gap .",
    "the cases in which the difference between two minima is less than 200 kev are marked with a star and the results for the two deformations are presented . in general , the calculated binding energies agree quite well with the experimental values , although the proton - rich isotopes are slightly underbound in the calculations .",
    "our calculations , with one exception , predict that the non - spherical even nuclei in the two isotopic chains will have an oblate ground state deformation .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the mller - nix systematics which , with two exceptions , predicts prolate deformations for the ground states of the non - spherical nuclei of the two chains .",
    "such disagreement is not too surprising , given the sensitivity to the interaction parameters of the binding energy versus deformation curve of many of these nuclei .",
    "an example of this sensitivity was displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , in which the ground state of @xmath245sr was seen to be prolate for @xmath298 but oblate for @xmath299 and 0.58 .",
    "we note that , of the the five nuclei for which we found a second minimum within 200 kev of the ground state one , the deformation of the second minimum of four of these nuclei is in agreement with the mller - nix prediction .",
    "experimentally , large ground state deformations of @xmath303 have been found in @xmath304sr , @xmath305kr , and @xmath304kr@xcite .",
    "these values are in agreement with the mller - nix ones and with our result for @xmath304sr .",
    "they are not consistent with our results for the kr isotopes .",
    "the calculated isotope shifts of the even - even kr and sr isotopes , with respect to the reference nuclei @xmath306kr and @xmath307sr , respectively , are compared to the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] .",
    "we display only the results for the deepest energy minimum of each isotope in the figure . in the cases in which a second minimum is close in energy to the deepest one , their isotopic shifts are also very similar .",
    "we find the agreement with the data for the neutron rich side to be very good .",
    "in addition , the positions of the kink due to the shell effect for the kr and sr isotopes are also well reproduced . however , the calculations underestimate the isotope shift on the proton rich side of the stability line .",
    "we have used an extension of the gorkov formalism for the description of pairing to develop a dirac - hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation to the ground state wave function and energy of finite nuclei .",
    "we have applied it to spin - zero proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing within the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov approximation ( we neglected the fock term ) .",
    "we have retained the full dirac structure of the pairing field that is permitted by the symmetries of the problem .",
    "we find the dirac pairing structure to be dominated by a scalar term and the zero component of a vector term , as has also been found to be the case for @xmath1s@xmath2 pairing in symmetric nuclear matter .    in our calculations",
    ", we use a zero - range approximation to the pairing interaction , which results in a local pairing field .",
    "we justified the zero - range approximation by arguing that the effective length for spatial variations of the wavefunctions , in the calculations performed at present , is larger than the range of the nonlocality of the pairing interaction , rendering the effects of the nonlocality close to negligible .",
    "we studied the effects of the dirac pairing field on the properties of the even - even nuclei of the isotopic chains of ca , ni and sn ( spherical ) and kr and sr ( deformed ) , as well as the @xmath0=28 isotonic chain .",
    "we first studied the isotopic chains of the spherical nuclei in order to determine the sensitivity of various nuclear observables to the interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "we found the two - neutron separation energies , root - mean - square radii and isotopic shifts of the spherical nuclei to be fairly independent of the strength of the pairing interaction .",
    "the binding energy , on the contrary , is quite sensitive to the pairing interaction strength ( at least when the pairing is not identically zero due to a shell closure ) .",
    "quite obviously , the average pairing gap also displays a strong dependence on the strength of the pairing interaction .",
    "we observed that an adequate choice of this strength simultaneously yields reasonable values for the binding energy , near the stability line , and rough agreement between the average pairing gap and the experimental gap , defined in terms of even - odd mass differences .",
    "far from the stability line , our calculated binding energies showed increasing discrepancies with the experimental data , suggesting that the nl3 parameter set might require further adustment , at least when used in a dhb formalism .",
    "all in all , however , our results show good agreement with the data and with previous calculations .",
    "to study the deformed kr and sr nuclei and the deformed nuclei of the @xmath0=28 isotonic chain , we performed a sequence of constrained dirac - hartree - bogoliubov calculations , as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath278 , for each of the nuclei in question .",
    "each sequence of calculations provided us with a curve of binding energy versus deformation that permitted the localization of the equilibrium configurations of the nucleus .",
    "most of the nuclei in these three chains present both a prolate and an oblate minimum ( and , at times , a slight spherical minimum as well ) . in agreement with other calculations , we found nuclei in each of the chains for which the energies of the oblate and prolate minima were very similar , raising the possibility of shape coexistence or triaxial ground state deformations . for the most part , our results present reasonable agreement with the data and with previous calculations .",
    "we did , however , observe a discrepancy between our average pairing gaps and those of the rhb calculations of ref.@xcite , which we took as an indication of the relativistic suppression of the pairing field due to its dirac structure .",
    "our dhb calculations furnished quadrupole deformations similar to the rhb ones for average values of the pairing gap that are about 30% smaller than theirs .",
    "based on the nuclei we have studied here , we conclude that the dhb approximation can provide a description of the binding energies , rms radii and ground state deformations of finite nuclei that is at least as good as that provided by the nonrelativistic hfb approximation or by the rhb approximation .",
    "our claim that the dhb approximation can provide a more reliable description than the others , however , has not been demonstrated here .",
    "this will require further study of the parameters that enter the pairing interaction , in order to better fix their values .    in the future ,",
    "we plan to extend our calculations to a larger set of isotopic chains and to analyze in detail their proton- and neutron - rich tails , in order to obtain a set of parameters that describes these better .",
    "we plan to extend our calculations to odd nuclei by including a blocking term .",
    "as the blocking term varies , along with the other states , during the search for the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov stationary point , this does not seem to be a trivial task . in order to facilitate it",
    ", we plan to first develop an extended bcs approximation , based on the self - consistent hartree eigenstates of the mean field in conjunction with the relativistic pairing field .",
    "such an approximation could also serve as a faster first stage to the dirac - hartree - bogoliubov calculations , which are quite time - consuming at the present .",
    "eventually , we also intend to include the nonlocality of the pairing interaction , in order to use more realistic interactions containing the relatively long - range effects of pion exchange .",

    ", we see that @xmath309 the self - energy term , in turn , can be put into the form @xmath310            for the photon : @xmath317 @xmath318 in short , the products of the pairs of vertices remain unchanged by the transformation .",
    "we thus have for the transformed self energy , @xmath319 in which the only differences from the original expression for the self energy are the propagator contributions , written in terms of the solutions of the dirac - gorkov equation , that enter the expression .",
    "in which the only difference between the original expression and the transformed one is again the propagator s contribution to the expression .",

    "each is a solution of an equation with the same energy eigenvalue but with orbital quantum numbers and mean fields that have the time - reversed dirac structure of the other .",
    "if each member of these pairs of states possessing time - reversed dirac structure are equally occupied , the sums over states that enter into the definition of the self - energy and pairing fields will be invariant under the transformation that temporally inverts the dirac structure .",
    "that is , we then have that      and @xmath326 in this case , both of the wavevectors @xmath324 and @xmath142 satisfy the same dirac - gorkov equation with the same energy eigenvalue",
    ". then either both or neither of them will enter the propagator s contributions to the self - consistency equations and these contributions will indeed be invariant under time - inversion of their dirac structure .",
    "we assume this to be the case ."
