    "for systems of differential equations that are piecewise - smooth  smooth except for discontinuities on isolated surfaces  orbits may cross discontinuity surfaces or slide along them . sliding motion models frictional sticking in mechanics @xcite , for example , and is used to achieve robust control via switched feedback mechanisms in electronics @xcite .",
    "the definition of sliding involves certain rules and assumptions that are not part of the standard theory of dynamical systems , and which remain incompletely understood .",
    "filippov @xcite showed that sliding motion can be defined by taking a convex combination of the vector field across its discontinuities . for a single discontinuity surface",
    "this gives a unique solution , but along the intersection of two or more discontinuity surfaces this gives a family of solutions .",
    "alternatively , sliding motion can be defined by perturbing the system in a manner that generates a classical solution , and then taking the limit as the size of the perturbation goes to zero . for a single discontinuity surface",
    "this gives a unique solution ( equivalent to filippov s solution ) for many types of perturbation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of sliding motion defined in this way for intersecting discontinuity surfaces .",
    "our main result is that the sliding motion may be uniquely defined but highly sensitive to variations in the vector field , causing ` jitter ' in the sliding solutions .",
    "consider an @xmath0-dimensional system @xmath1 whose right - hand side @xmath2 is smooth except on discontinuity surfaces @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that each @xmath4 divides @xmath5 into two pieces , hence @xmath6 divides @xmath5 into @xmath7 open regions @xmath8 , some of which may be empty or disconnected .",
    "we then write @xmath9 where @xmath10 are independent smooth vector fields .",
    "sliding solutions to ( [ eq : ns ] ) are those that evolve on at least one discontinuity surface @xmath4 for a sustained interval of time .",
    "about a single discontinuity surface , say @xmath11 bounding @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the convex combination @xmath14 \\ ; , \\label{eq : convexcombination}\\ ] ] describes the convex hull of values that @xmath15 can explore by evolving in arbitrarily small increments of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the switching multiplier @xmath18 can be interpreted as the proportion of time spent following @xmath19 , and @xmath20 as the proportion of time spent following @xmath21 ( this relates to the _ duty cycle _ in electronics ) .",
    "filippov s solution is found by solving for the value of @xmath18 that gives @xmath22 tangent to @xmath11 . letting @xmath23 represent @xmath11 , where @xmath24 is a continuous function , the tangency condition is @xmath25 .",
    "filippov s solution therefore satisfies @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "recent generalizations have extended filippov s method to permit non - convex combinations @xcite .",
    "such solution methods assume an ideal model of switching .",
    "we may choose to add more complexity to the formulation of the discontinuity for two main reasons .",
    "first , in numerical simulations or from a theoretical viewpoint we may seek to ` regularise ' ( [ eq : ns ] ) on @xmath28 to resolve ambiguities in evolution resulting from the discontinuity .",
    "second , we may use alternate switching formulations in order to model complex physical processes , such as an electronic switch @xcite , a change in the direction of coulomb friction @xcite , a discontinuous change of the surface reflectivity of the earth @xcite , predator switching between prey sources @xcite , phase transition of a superconductor at its critical temperature @xcite , and so on .",
    "a major challenge for the theory of piecewise - smooth systems is to understand the robustness of ( [ eq : ns ] ) to different kinds of regularisation .",
    "there are a handful of regularisations that are obvious to consider . here",
    "we describe these for a single discontinuity surface @xmath11 between regions @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; the extension to multiple switches follows naturally .",
    "we suppose @xmath11 is defined by @xmath23 , with @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the regularisations we consider are :    1 .   _ smoothing _ : the switch between @xmath19 and @xmath21 is modulated by a continuous function @xmath33 with @xmath34 for @xmath35 ; specifically we consider @xmath36 ; 2 .   _",
    "hysteresis _ : a switch from @xmath19 to @xmath21 as @xmath37 decreases occurs when @xmath38 , while a switch from @xmath21 to @xmath19 as @xmath37 increases occurs when @xmath39 ; 3 .   _ time - delay _ : a switch occurs at a time @xmath40 after crossing @xmath11 ; 4 .",
    "_ discretization _ : the system is discretized , say via the forward euler numerical scheme : @xmath41 .",
    "_ noise _ : the ordinary differential equation @xmath42 is converted to a stochastic differential equation via the addition of order @xmath40 noise , or the switching function @xmath37 is perturbed to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a stochastic process .    the effect of smoothing a discontinuity is largely understood and is in the main rather simple . typically ( if the system is non - degenerate and absent of certain singularities ) the smooth system @xmath45 is equivalent to the discontinuous system up to order @xmath40 ( or order @xmath46 where @xmath47 for some singularities ) @xcite .    for an attracting section of a single discontinuity surface ,",
    "the effects of the remaining types of perturbation are also straight - forward .",
    "with hysteresis , time - delay , or discretization by forward euler , one obtains ` chattering ' solutions that tend to filippov s solution in the zero - perturbation limit ( @xmath48 ) @xcite .",
    "similarly additive white noise perturbations yield stochastic solutions that tend to filippov s solution as @xmath48 @xcite . near singularities",
    "the situation can be more involved  discretizing near grazing points in the presence of a limit cycle leads to micro - chaos @xcite , and regularisations of two - fold singularities leads to a probabilistic notion of forward evolution @xcite .",
    "in general , away from bifurcation points and determinacy - breaking singularities , the dynamics about a single discontinuity surface is robust to perturbations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .  [",
