    "survival analysis is a class of statistical methods for studying the occurrence and timing of events with the ability to incorporate censored observations .",
    "our research is a follow up study of the paper _ a recurrent - events survival analysis on the duration of olympic records _ by gutirrez , gonzlez , and lozano ( 2011 ) , in which survival analysis methods were used to examine the duration of track and field olympic records .",
    "we expand on this previous research by elaborating on censoring as it pertains to this olympic data , adding many more covariates , and extending our analysis to canoeing , cycling , and swimming . in terms of modeling , we reproduce previous models estimated , as well as introduce a logistic model that has not yet been applied to olympic data .",
    "+ as this is a study of time to event data , we defined an event to be a new olympic record being set .",
    "our main goal was to gain insight about what determines how long olympic records last .",
    "censoring of a record occurred when we had incomplete information about when a record would have been or will be broken , and these are the two cases of censoring we worked with in this study .",
    "the first case is a result of any record that is currently standing .",
    "the information about these records is incomplete in the sense that we do not know when current records will be broken .",
    "another case of censoring comes from any record that spanned over the years in which the olympics were cancelled due to world war i ( wwi ) or world war ii ( wwii ) .",
    "the information concerning these records is also incomplete because we do not know if the standing record at that time would have been broken if those particular olympic games had not been cancelled .",
    "data for this study was collected from _",
    "www.olympic.org _ and _ www.databaseolympics.com_. given that absolute , as opposed to relative , record times , distances , heights , etc .",
    "are necessary for tracking the olympic record progression of a particular event , the olympic events analyzed were limited to individual events contained in track & field , canoeing , cycling , and swimming categories .",
    "record durations span from the first modern olympic games held in athens , greece in 1896 to the most recent games held in beijing , china in 2008 . in the total of 27 olympic games that have occurred ,",
    "there have been 690 distinct records in the 63 different olympic events that were considered .",
    "note that the way in which the event time data was collected did not allow for a record to be both set and broken within the same olympic games .",
    "only the time , distance , or height achieved by gold medalists were defined to be the record , if in fact it was better than all prior gold medal performances .",
    "this was done to avoid potentially including records which lasted only a very short time ( perhaps a few days ) , which would be assigned a duration of 0 in a discrete model where records can only last a multiple of 4 years .",
    "a _ covariate _ is a factor that has an effect on the length of time that a record lasts .",
    "a wide variety of covariates were taken into account in order to characterize a record .",
    "we considered many characteristics of specific records and specific olympic games .",
    "here is a detailed explanation of the covariates that were considered :    * * gender * - 1 for males and 0 for females .",
    "+ * * category * - 1 for track , 2 for field , 3 for canoeing , 4 for cycling , and 5 for swimming . + * * sameathlete * - 1 if the previous record was set by the same person , 0 otherwise . + * * samecountry * - 1 if the previous record was set by a person from the same country , 0 otherwise . + * * hostcountry * - 1 if the record setter is from the same country that the olympics are being held , 0 otherwise . + * * medal * - 1 if the person who set the record was an previous olympic medalist at the time of setting the record , 0 otherwise . + * * worldrecord * - 1 if the olympic record is the world record , 0 otherwise . +",
    "* * age * - the age of the record setter at the time the record was set . + * * percent change athletes ( pca ) * - the percent change of the number of participants . + * * percent change in countries ( pcc ) * - the percent change in the number of countries participating .",
    "+ * * dgdp * - growth rate of per capita gdp of the country of the record setter . +",
    "* * dpop * - growth rate of the population of the country of the record setter . + * * medal count ( mc ) * - the number medals won by the record setter s country through the 2008 olympics . + * * number of records ( nr ) * - the total number of records set at the olympics in the year a record is set . + * * marginal record improvement ( mri ) * - the percent difference between the new record and the previous record . + * * total record improvement ( tri ) * - the percent difference between the new record and the first record .",
    "+ * * world record improvement ( wri ) * - the percent difference between the olympic record and the contemporaneous world record .",
    "+    tables 1 - 4 show some simple statistics about our olympic data .",
    "table  [ censored ] tells us the number of total observations , number of censored entries , and the number of records that failed , which is how many records have been broken .",
    "table  [ freq ] tells us the frequency , or number of records , within each olympic sport category .",
    "table  [ covariatefreq ] tells us the the number of records that are characterized by either a `` 1 '' or a `` 0 '' value for the categorical covariates that we included .",
    "table  [ means ] gives us some simple summary statistics about our quantitative covariates .",
    "duration , which is the dependent variable , represents the number of years the olympic record lasted , which has a mean of 6.4 years .",
    ".censored and uncensored values [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since there are so few record durations of more than 20 years , we were unable to produce reliable estimates of the survival function for @xmath0 greater than 20 , as seen in table  [ surv_est ] , so only records that were set after 1988 could be used to make predictions .",
    "of the 63 events that were analyzed , the current records for 51 of them were set in 1992 or later , so it was these 51 records that we were able to incorporate into our predictions found in table  [ pred ] .",
    "therefore , of the 51 records included , the wang - chang , the generalized km , and the mle frailty predict that 31.14 , 25.74 , and 20.12 of them will be broken in 2012 respectively .",
    "the factors that go in to new olympic records being set may seem like a mystery to some and completely arbitrary to others . however , we ventured to shed some light on the issue using survival analysis methods and techniques .",
    "we first used the kaplan - meier estimator to determine which covariates significantly affected the duration of a record and also ran checks for dependence to inform our subsequent analysis .",
    "after prleminary measures , we estimated five different models with significant covariates .",
    "four of these models were extensions of the cox proportional hazards model while the other was a discrete - time logistic model for repeated events . in the end ,",
    "the logistic model was the best fit to our data based on the akaike information criterion , and it depended primarily on the following covariates : sameathlete , worldrecord , pcc , mri , and tri .",
    "we also used survival estimates from three different recurrent event survivor function estimators to determine the number of new records that will be set in the 2012 olympics . in 51 of the 63 events we considered",
    ", the estimated number of records that will be broken is somewhere between 20.12 and 31.14 .",
    "+ future research might include considering more events in the analysis .",
    "this could mean adding different individual events , as well as team and winter events .",
    "we would also like to investigate covariates that were not included in our analysis such as ethnicity , a measure of technological improvements , and percentage change of males and females competing .",
    "we would like to thank california state university , fresno and the national science foundation for their financial support ( nsf grant # dms-1156273 ) , the california state university , fresno mathematics reu program , and dr .",
    "ke wu for his support during the completion of the project ."
