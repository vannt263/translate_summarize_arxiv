    ". currently , the most massive star to have a detected planet is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this dearth of planets around massive stars could be the result of several factors .",
    "first , there is intense uv radiation from the star that can rapidly destroy the disk .",
    "second , the lifetime of the star is much shorter .",
    "we should note , however , that selection effects may be important since the planets ( if they exist ) would probably be impossible to detect . because the star is more massive and brighter than a low mass star , neither the transit method nor the radial velocity method is sensitive enough to detect a planet .    supposing that such planets can still form , then there are several conditions that must be met in order for them to survive the death of the star .",
    "the orbital radii of the planets must be larger than about @xmath14 in order to survive being engulfed during the red  giant phase . in the supernova explosion , half of the mass of the system is ejected . in order for planets to survive ,",
    "the explosion must be asymmetric .",
    "the asymmetry results in a velocity kick to the newly formed pulsar that must be in a similar direction to the motion of the planet at the time of the supernova @xcite .",
    "planets that survive would be expected to be in eccentric orbits at orbital radii of at least a few au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism is unlikely to form a system with more than one planet ( if any ) . for three planets to survive",
    "this process is almost certainly impossible and so the planets around psr b1257 + 12 formed after the pulsar .",
    "furthermore , the two other known pulsar planets most likely did not form in this way since psr b162026 is a circumbinary planet and psr j17191438 is extremely close to its host star .",
    "none of the known pulsar planets formed in this way and we suggest that the probability for planets to form in this scenario is negligible .      when a pulsar forms in a supernova , most of the material of the star is ejected .",

    "this is similar to the masses observed in a protoplanetary disks around young stars that lie in the range @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath17 is the mass of the host star . however , the angular momentum of the fallback disk may be very different .",
    "recently , @xcite considered the formation of a supernova fallback disk around neutron stars ( and black holes ) with numerical simulations of supernova explosions .",
    "they found that if magnetic torques play a role in angular momentum transport , then supernova fallback disks do not form around neutron stars .",
    "any material that falls back has too little angular momentum to orbit the neutron star even once .",
    "however , formation can occur when the magnetic torques are negligible .",
    "this requires the energy of the explosion to be finely tuned so that the fall back mass would on one hand not cause the neutron star to collapse to a black hole , but on the other would be sufficient to form a disk .",
    "@xcite found a typical fallback mass of @xmath18 with the maximum specific angular momentum of the material @xmath19 .",
    "we can calculate the circularization radius for such a disk .",
    "the radius of a ring of material with a given specific angular momentum , @xmath20 , is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the pulsar . for typical parameters",

    "this is in line with estimates by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a simple estimate for the lifetime of such a disk is the viscous timescale @xmath26 where the viscosity is @xmath27 @xmath28 is the disk aspect ratio , @xmath29 is the keplerian angular frequency and @xmath30 is the @xcite viscosity parameter . for typical values at the circularization radius",
    "we find @xmath31 the viscous disk spreads both inwards and outwards leading to a longer lifetime for larger radii .",
    "however , even an increase in this timescale by several orders of magnitude would not be sufficient for a reasonable timescale for planet formation . even taking into account uncertainties in some of the physical parameters , if a supernova fallback disk does form , its lifetime is far too short for planet formation to occur .",
    "observations aimed at finding fallback disks around pulsars have not been successful ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this , combined with the lack of observed planets around young pulsars @xcite suggests that planets do not form in a supernova fallback disk .",
    "the observed planets more likely formed during a later accretion phase that led to the spin up of the pulsar .",
    "this model involves a close binary composed of a msp ( or its progenitor ) and a low  mass main  sequence star or compact companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the companion is losing mass through evaporation because it is being irradiated by the pulsar . if the evaporation timescale is shorter than the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz timescale the secondary responds adiabatically to the mass loss .",
    "the companion star fills its roche lobe and is dynamically disrupted if its radius increases faster than the roche ",
    "lobe radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is most likely to happen when the companion is fully convective or degenerate ( e.g. for a low mass star the radius of the star is proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mass of the star ) .",
    "the star is dynamically disrupted and forms a massive disk around the primary with a mass of around @xmath34 .    in the specific case of the merger of two white dwarfs",
    ", the orbit shrinks due to gravitational radiation until the less massive white dwarf fills its roche lobe .",
    "however , in this case , there is some uncertainty whether the merger will lead to a type  ia supernova rather than to the formation of a pulsar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is most likely that a pulsar must be a component of the binary before the destruction of the companion .    during the dissolution of a companion star ,",
    "the material forms a disk at a radius comparable to the initial separation of the binary , but then spreads out through viscous effects .",
    "note that the disk formed is much larger than that expected from a supernova fallback disk .",
    "the total angular momentum of the disk is @xmath35 this is several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum estimate for the angular momentum of the supernova fallback disk given in equation  ( [ sf ] ) . with the viscous timescale given by equation  ( [ tauvisc ] ) and the viscosity in equation  ( [ nu ] ) , at a radius of @xmath36",
    ", we find the viscous timescale to be @xmath37 since some material spreads outwards from its initial radius , the disk lifetime is longer than this .",
    "for example , material that reaches @xmath38 has a viscous timescale of over @xmath39 .",
    "this is similar to the disk lifetime for a protoplanetary disk around a young star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore suggest that the destruction of a companion star is the most likely scenario for forming the planetary system around psr b1257 + 12 .",
    "the accretion rate is typically @xmath40 which is @xmath41 this is similar to typical accretion rates observed around young t  tauri stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over time , as the mass of the disk decreases , the accretion rate also decreases . for a fully viscous disk ,",
    "once the material has spread out into the inner regions , the disk can be modeled to be in a quasi  steady  state . in section  [ pd ]",
    "we investigate the properties of this model further .",
    "a companion star may be evaporated by the radiation from a pulsar @xcite .",
    "the companion has to be almost , but not completely , evaporated by the pulsar leaving a remnant that is planet sized .",
    "this is thought to be the explanation for the planet in psr j17191438 .",
    "this mechanism is only capable of forming a single planet around a pulsar and so this scenario is unlikely to have been responsible for the planetary system around psr b1257 + 12 .",
    "the fine tuning required for this mechanism for planet formation means that this is probably a rare event .",
    "if the companion is completely evaporated and the planets form from that debris , then the formation is somewhat similar to that described in the previous section  [ dis ] .",
    "however , the disk formed in this manner may have very little mass and so planet formation may be unlikely .    in summary ,",
    "the most likely mechanisms for pulsar planet formation require a low mass companion to the pulsar .",
    "in the next section we examine the parameters required to form an extreme mass ratio binary that is potentially capable of pulsar planet formation .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , planet formation around a pulsar requires a low mass binary companion . a massive star that ends its life as a neutron star has a mass in the approximate range @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the binary fraction of high mass stars may be quite high , up to 100% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for pulsar planet formation , the binary companion must have a mass such that when it is accreted on to the pulsar it does not cause the latter to collapse to form a black hole .",
    "if the companion is a fully convective low mass main  sequence star , its mass is in the approximate range @xmath43 .",
    "alternatively , the companion may be a very low mass white dwarf , and the progenitor star would have to have a mass less than a solar mass .",
    "observationally , the mass ratio distribution of binaries is dependent on the mass of the primary star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the binary mass ratio distribution for high mass primary stars is not well constrained for low mass ratios , @xmath44 . however , for @xmath45 the mass ratio distribution is relatively flat ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that this extends to lower mass objects the probability of a binary forming with a mass ratio required to form pulsar planets @xmath46 is @xmath47% .    when the pulsar formed in a supernova explosion , an asymmetry in the explosion leads to a kick on the newly formed neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in conclusion , we find that pulsar planet formation requires both an extreme mass ratio binary and for this binary to survive the supernova explosion that forms the pulsar .",
    "the probability of an extreme mass ratio binary forming and surviving the supernova is very small .",
    "the main difference between a protoplanetary disk around a young star and a disk around a pulsar is that the pulsar strongly irradiates the disk and provides an additional source of heating .",

    "this can result in a massive disk that is unstable to gravitational instability if the @xcite parameter becomes sufficiently small .",

    "migration through a dead zone is likely to be much slower than migration through a fully viscous disk @xcite and so the planets can more easily survive the migration process without being accreted on to the pulsar in the presence of a dead zone .",
    "the inner edge of the dead zone will move inwards in time as the disk mass and accretion rate drop ( see fig .",
    "[ rcrit ] ) and so the planets will likely remain in the dead zone throughout the disk lifetime ( if the dead zone exists ) .",
    "@xcite used the surface density profiles from the layered disk models of @xcite to determine initial conditions for the solid material in planetary embryos for a set of n  body simulations to model the formation of planets around the pulsar psr b1257 + 12 .",
    "they found that the layered disk model provided a better fit to the final planetary systems because it resulted in the planets forming from a narrow annulus ( this is also true in the solar system , see * ? ? ?",
    "searches for debris disks around pulsars have revealed no infrared counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , debris disks have been suggested to be around two magnetars 4u 0142 + 61 and 1e 2259 + 286 @xcite .",
    "maybe the fact that planets were not found yet orbiting white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but that the surface layers of some white dwarfs show ( perhaps ) pollution by planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicate that indeed there were no dead zones , and either planets did not form , or else they migrated all the way in through a viscous disk .    in this work",
    "we have concentrated on a steady  state disk model . however , as we have discussed in section  [ pd ] , a disk model that includes a dead zone is not in steady  state since material builds up within the dead zone .",
    "furthermore , the dead zone will slow the rate of expansion of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "material only flows outwards in a layer of surface density @xmath114 rather than the full surface density . for small active layer surface densities",
    ", the disk will have a large extended region of low density and a compact high density dead zone region .",
    "the steady  state disk solutions described in this work are certainly adequate up to around the initial separation of the binary , but outside of that , time ",
    "dependent calculations will be required to determine the evolution .",
    "the non  monotonic surface density profile of the disk will also affect the process of planet formation and may aid the formation of a compact planetary system @xcite . in a future publication",
    ", we will investigate the time ",
    "dependent effects of such a disk model and their potential implications for pulsar planet formation .",
    "we explain the small number of observed pulsar planets through a combination of two low  probability events .",
    "first , the most likely formation site is in a disk formed by the destruction of a companion star .",
    "this also explains why all the pulsar planets that we have found are around millisecond pulsars rather than young pulsars .",
    "a binary that allows for such a scenario must have an extreme mass ratio and has a very small chance of forming and surviving the supernova explosion .",
    "second , planet formation is thought to require a dead zone , a region of low turbulence , within the protoplanetary disk .",
    "because pulsars have a much stronger source of irradiation than a young star , the additional heating can lead to sufficient ionization that the dead zone does not form .",
    "the inner boundary of the dead zone is pushed farther out , due to the irradiation , into a region of the disk with lower surface density . a dead zone",
    "only forms if the surface density that is ionized by external sources is small , @xmath108 .",
