    "the isotropy of gamma - ray bursts on the sky combined with the significant deviation of the log@xmath0/log@xmath1 curve from a @xmath2 power law ( @xcite ) gave the first clear evidence that sources of gamma - ray bursts are at cosmological distances , where the deficit of observed number of dim events is a direct consequence of the non - euclidean - nuture of the expanding universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "strong evidence in favor of the cosmological paradigm has recently been provided by the detection of red - shifted spectral lines from the optical counterparts of grb 970508 ( @xcite ) and grb 971214 ( @xcite ) .    as soon as the cosmological paradigm became popular for gamma - ray bursts , two effects were suggested to test it using the observational data of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the first one is the effect of cosmological red shift , which predicts that the energy of spectral features of dimmer bursts should be red - shifted in respect to similar features of bright events .",
    "the second one is the complementary effect of cosmological time dilation , which predicts that light curves of dimmer bursts should be time - stretched with respect to those of brighter events .",
    "since both effects are associated with the geometry of the expending universe , we will refer to them as @xmath3 effects .",
    "the transformation factors are known to be @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the red shifts of emitters of bright and dim bursts , respectively .",
    "if the brightest bursts are associated with the nearest objects and the dimmest bursts are related to the furthest emitters , their intensities could be used to determine distances to the corresponding emitters . in this case",
    "the cosmological effects should lead to a hardness / intensity correlation ( due to the red shift ) , and a stretching / intensity anti - correlation ( due to the time dilation ) .    however , gamma - ray bursts are known to be very different from each other . in searching for the generic effects of hardness / intensity correlations and stretching / intensity anti - correlation between different intensity groups",
    ", one has to identify generic signatures among the divergence of properties of individual events to represent the properties of _ typical _ burst emission .",
    "using such signatures , the effects of hardness / intensity correlation and stretching / intensity anti - correlation have been studied by comparing groups of batse bursts with different brightnesses .",
    "the average peak energy @xmath7 of @xmath8 spectra was found to show a hardness / intensity correlation consistent with cosmological red shift ( @xcite ) , and there is evidence that average emissivity curves of dimmer bursts are stretched relative to those of brighter bursts , although the results of different analyses are not entirely consistent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that the stretching of dimmer bursts might result from a selection effect has been considered , and it has been shown that it is not a selection effect ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is also not clear that the results of red shift and time dilation studies agree with each other ( @xcite )",
    ".    on the other hand , the logically simple concept that burst intensities are `` standard candles '' may not be correct .",
    "it has been shown ( @xcite ) that the broad spread of observed intensities of bursts could result from a broad spread of intrinsic luminosities of emitters .",
    "also , three bursts with measured red - shifts of afterglowing optical emission have gamma - ray luminosity differing over a range of @xmath920 times . despite of small sample size",
    ", these three events provide quite good evidence that grbs are not standard candles . the correlations of burst hardness and duration with intensity could be related in this case to the intrinsic properties of sources rather than to geometrical effects of cosmological space ( citemit2 ) .",
    "furthermore , one should take into account that the astronomical population of emitters could be quite different at close and distant cosmological distances . in this case",
    "the difference between brightness groups could reflect the intrinsic evolution of sources rather than cosmological effects .",
    "therefore , to test the cosmological paradigm it is necessary to separate in the data the _ geometrical effects _ due to cosmological expansion of the universe from the _ physical effects _ due to intrinsic luminosity - based correlation of emitters and the _ astronomical effects _ due to evolution of sources over the different red shifts .",
    "to compare the average temporal and spectral signatures of gamma - ray bursts with different brightness , 6 intensity groups , each consisting of @xmath10 bursts , were selected by their peak fluxes @xmath11 on the 1024  ms time scale in the 3b batse catalog ( @xcite ) , as shown in table 1 .",
    "the time profile of each burst has a well - defined moment @xmath12 when the observed flux reaches a maximum @xmath11 .",
    "one might postulate that peaks are associated with some particular physical transition , when the average rising trend of intensity before the peak is converted into the decaying tail after that .",
    "the procedure of peak alignment has the physical sense to combine all bursts together at the same stage of the emission process . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath8 energy spectrum of burst emission usually has a well - defined peak energy @xmath13 , but @xmath7 typically varies with time during a burst .",
    "one could , however , introduce a single - valued spectral parameter for each burst , which is the peak energy @xmath14 of the spectrum at the time of peak photon flux @xmath11 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath14 as the _ double - peak energy _ , which corresponds to photons with the largest spectral density of emission .",
    "we evaluated the double - peak energy @xmath14 for each batse burst using the cont data , which has a time resolution of 2048  ms ( @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of these energies for the reference group and for the dimmest intensity group are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the observed distributions for these groups might be compared with k - s test provided that the reference group is shifted leftward to match the curves for the dimmer groups .",
    "the lowest k - s probability is equal to 0.3 for the comparison between reference group and dimmest intensity group when they are shifted to the same mean .",
    "the present data allows us to measure with statistical significance these shifts , but does not reveal any difference in the shapes .",
    "we might assume that there is an _",
    "universal _ log - normal law for all these distributions , which can be parameterized using a set of red - shifting factors @xmath15 , defined by shifting the log - normal distribution for the brightest reference group ( @xmath16 ) to provide the best fit for the corresponding distributions of the dimmer intensity groups ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the best - fitting shift factors and the log - normal average values @xmath18 for our selected intensity groups .",
    "the differences between them show the effect of hardness / intensity correlation of gamma - ray bursts . basically , the ratios between the average double - peak energies for different brightness groups @xmath19 are very close to the best fitting shifting factors @xmath20 .",
    "the difference of the average peak fluxes between the 100 brightest and 100 dimmest bursts is a factor of @xmath943 , while the the corresponding log - normal average values of the double peak energy differ by a factor of @xmath213 ( table 1 ) .",
    "a robust temporal parameter for bursts is very difficult to define .",
    "bursts have a variety of light curves , and for many of them the light curves are very complex .",
    "the evaluation of a _ duration - type _",
    "parameter depends on the sensitivity of the instrument , its energy range , and its time resolution .",
    "the best known parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 attribute definite durations to any individual burst , but there are several statistical biases that could affect the results when statistical studies are performed using them .    below we suggest another duration - type parameter that could be associated with a group of bursts .",
    "it was defined using the average emissivity curves ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ace is known to be a quite robust signature for any large group of bursts .",
    "this ace profile represents the slow component of burst variability , which can be interpreted as the _ general envelope _ of individual light curves . by its nature , the ace averages over the faster variability , leaving only the signature of _ slow clocks _",
    ", so in computing the ace of batse gamma - ray bursts we can use the discla and cont data , which have 1024  ms and 2048  ms time resolution , respectively . the ace intermixes individual events with all their particular time profiles , and represents them by one profile , which is a single asymmetric peak with steeper rise front and flatter back slope . therefore , for each intensity group @xmath24 the ace profile can be used to estimate the average duration of rise fronts and back slopes for averaged events .",
    "although the batse data set is large , the variety of burst time profiles is such that we must consider its effect on the variance among finite samples .",
    "we have found by direct comparison of ace profiles for different samples of batse bursts that they were much more distinct than would be expected from the errors of sample variance for individual samples .",
    "this means that a random sample of bursts for individual groups does not ensure the well - weighted contribution of events with all kinds of profiles . to study the random choice statistics of bursts ,",
    "a special monte carlo simulation was performed using the total set of 603 bursts in the 3b catalog with durations @xmath25  s ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the distributions of stretching coefficients @xmath26 due to statistics of random choice were found to be much broader than expected from the sample variance predicted by normal statistics . from the simulations , the 1@xmath27 deviation around a non - stretched value @xmath28 for a sample of n bursts",
    "was found to be @xmath29 this value can be used as an estimate of the error in stretching factors between aces for any two groups of @xmath0 bursts .",
    "the present size of our selected intensity groups ( table 1 ) allows us to resolve stretching at @xmath30 significance between them provided the effect is larger than @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is a simple analytic form that provides a very good fit to the ace profile @xmath32(t ) for time intervals of 2050  s around the maximum : @xmath33 where the exponent @xmath34 has different values @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the rise front and back slope , respectively .",
    "this law allows us to take into account the energy dependence of aces ( @xcite ) by interpolating in energy between the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 measured for aces in three batse discriminator channels ( 2550 kev , 50100 kev and 100300 kev ) .",
    "it also allows us to use a time - efficient procedure to estimate the relative time - stretching factor between ace profiles for any two samples with different intensity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure to build the ace includes the selection of the highest peak of each burst @xmath40 _ in count space _ and the normalization of time profiles by the @xmath40 value .",
    "therefore , the ace is sensitive to a bias resulting from domination of positive fluctuations in the selected peaks . due to this bias",
    "the ace profile is systematically lower in both wings ; i.e. , the measured value is narrower than the true value .",
    "the bias is stronger for dimmer bursts , where the influence of positive fluctuations is larger . to take it into account ,",
    "our reference group 1 ( the brightest one ) was transformed into an artificial reference group by monte carlo noisification , having the same event profiles but with dimmer peak fluxes . when the reference group 1 was dimmed down to the level of the dimmest group 6 ,",
    "the noise - produced ace was found to be different than the original ace by a factor of @xmath90.8 ( that is : narrower  see @xcite ) .    to estimate the average equivalent time width for the brightest reference group 1 , the observed ace profiles in three energy ranges @xmath41 ( 25 - 50 kev ) , @xmath42 ( 50 - 100 kev ) and @xmath43 ( 100 - 300 kev ) were used as they are .",
    "the bias due to positive fluctuations is assumed to have no influence on this group . using the ace@xmath44 profiles , we calculated average equivalent widths in each of three energy channels @xmath45 as @xmath46 for the rise front ( rf ) and back slope ( bs ) , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath47 were then interpolated over the broad energy range 25300 kev , and the equivalent width was determined at the double - peak energy @xmath48  kev .",
    "the values of @xmath49 for rise front and back slope are the temporal parameters @xmath50 for the reference group 1 ( table 1 ) .",
    "physically , @xmath51 represents the average duration of emission either over the rise or over the decay at the spectral range around the double - peak energy @xmath14 .",
    "ace@xmath52 profiles for dimmer groups ( @xmath176 ) can be used similarly to estimate temporal parameters , provided that they are corrected for the noise - produced narrowing of aces . for a given intensity group @xmath24 an artificial reference group @xmath53",
    "was created from the events of the reference group 1 by monte carlo noisification , in which the reference bursts are reduced in intensity to the fluxes of group @xmath24 , and noise added corresponding to the noise level of group @xmath24 .",
    "the artificial reference group @xmath53 therefore represents the original group 1 , but takes into account the noise - produced effects .",
    "therefore , to evaluate the noise - corrected average stretching between the testing group @xmath24 and the reference group 1 for energy channel @xmath45 , we measured the stretching factors @xmath54 between the ace@xmath52 of the actual dim group @xmath24 and the ace@xmath55 of the artificial reference group @xmath53 .",
    "we calculated @xmath54 separately for rise fronts ( rf ) and back slopes ( bs ) for intensity groups @xmath176 in three energy ranges @xmath413 .",
    "using these factors , the parameters of equivalent width of ace@xmath52 could be defined for the energy channels @xmath45 , as @xmath56 these values are corrected for the noise - produced narrowing of aces because they are determined from the stretching factors between the testing dim groups and the corresponding artificially noisified reference groups .",
    "the single - value temporal parameters @xmath57 were interpolated between the values @xmath58 for three discriminator channels @xmath413 at the double - peak energies @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters @xmath60 are presented in table 1 for rise fronts ( rf ) and back slopes ( bs ) of bursts .",
    "their errors are estimated from the choice statistics for stretching factors @xmath61 . the rise front equivalent widths @xmath62 do not show a correlation with burst intensity . on the other hand , the back slope equivalent widths @xmath63 are significantly increasing with decreasing intensity of bursts .",
    "the average double - peak energy @xmath64 and the equivalent time width @xmath60 at the double - peak energy are very useful parameters for testing the cosmological paradigm . indeed ,",
    "the energy - dimension parameters @xmath64 represent _ spectral signatures _ that have the same physical sense for all bright , medium and dim groups of bursts .",
    "the time - dimension parameters @xmath60 represent _ temporal signatures _ that are also well - defined for all groups of bursts .",
    "we have found that these parameters vary significantly among the different intensity groups .",
    "however , the differences between them could be caused either by the purely _ geometrical _ transformations of red shift and time dilation in the expanding universe , or by a _ physical _ variation among the outbursting sources in the co - moving frames .",
    "these two parameters can not by themselves be used to perform a model - independent test of the cosmological paradigm of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "one must either postulate some intrinsic properties of emitters and then resolve the cosmological transformations of observed gamma - ray bursts , or postulate the geometrical effects of time dilation and energy red shift and then deconvolve properties of observed bursts into the intrinsic properties of emitters .    as an alternative",
    ", we wish to find a special observational parameter for any selected sample of gamma - ray bursts that does not depend on the geometrical effects of the universe extension , and which we call an _ average cosmological invariant parameter _ ( acip)(@xcite ) .",
    "let us assume that some brightness group @xmath24 corresponds to emitters with red shifts around some average value @xmath65 and the corresponding equivalent width and double - peak energy equal @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the co - moving frame , respectively . then , since a time - dimensional average parameter is increased by a factor @xmath68 , giving @xmath69 in the observer s frame , and an energy - dimensional average parameter is reduced by a factor @xmath70 , giving @xmath71 in the observer s frame , the product @xmath72 of time - dimensional and energy - dimensional average parameters for the group is an invariant because the red shift factors cancel each other : @xmath73 therefore , any difference between values of @xmath74 for two different samples of bursts has to be attributed to a real physical difference between their emitters .",
    "the average durations of rise fronts and back slopes are known to have different behaviors for bursts with the different intensity .",
    "we calculated @xmath75 as defined in equation ( 6 ) for the same 6 brightness groups as in table 1 , separately for time signatures @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the results are presented in table 2 and figures 2 & 3 .",
    "one can consider emitters of gamma - ray bursts as _ standard candles _ with respect to the property described by the acip if the values are independent of brightness .",
    "this model can be rejected for the rise fronts of bursts : the assumption of a constant @xmath78 in our analysis has a negligibly small probability ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath80 decreases with decreasing average fluxes @xmath81 , as @xmath82 ^{0.22\\pm 0.03 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 is in units of @xmath84/@xmath85-s and @xmath86 is in units of kev - s .",
    "therefore @xmath78 can not be used as a _ standard candle _ ( figure 2 ) .",
    "of course , there may be a concern that the dimmest group suffers from incompleteness , since it is closest to the trigger threshold where slow - rising events can be missed ( @xcite ) . if we exclude the dimmest group from the fit in figure 2 , the fitted power - law index in eq .",
    "[ acip ] does not change dramatically : @xmath87 . in this case , the probability that the data are consistent with a constant is still very small ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the values of @xmath89 are consistent with a constant value ( figure 3 ) .",
    "quantitatively , we find that @xmath90 ^{0.03\\pm 0.03 } , \\ ] ] where the units are the same as in equation ( 7 ) . during the back slopes ,",
    "the differences between average @xmath91 and average @xmath92 ( table 1 ) for different intensity groups @xmath166 effectively compensate each other when they form such a product as @xmath93 .",
    "since the two are physically different parameters of emitters , we conclude that their brightness dependencies have predominantly a geometrical origin , i.e. , they are due to the geometrical transformations of time and energy in the expanding universe .    comparing the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the 100 brightest bursts ( group 1 , with peak fluxes @xmath96 @xmath84/@xmath97-s ) with those for the 100 dimmest bursts ( group 6 , with peak fluxes",
    "@xmath98 @xmath84/@xmath85-s ) , we find that the factor of cosmological transformation between emitters of these groups , both for time dilation and red shift , is about 3 ( table 1 ) . for this factor",
    "the value of @xmath6 for emitters of dimmest bursts is about 2 , provided the brightest bursts correspond to @xmath99 .",
    "recently it has been suggested that @xmath100 , based on measurements of the spectra of bright burst ( @xcite ) , and as the consequence of the idea that grbs sources should follow the history of star formation ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the group of dimmest bursts would have an average red - shift factor @xmath101 as large as @xmath102 . while the outbursting sources are effectively standard candles along the back slopes , they are not standard along the rise fronts of bursts .",
    "if the bursts have a cosmological origin , observations of dim and bright bursts correspond in local time to the younger and older universe , respectively .",
    "the variation of @xmath78 with intensity ( table 2 ) is associated with a difference of average duration @xmath76 in the co - moving frames of reference , because the values of @xmath14 are the same for both @xmath89 and @xmath103 . in the co - moving frames the bursts in the recent universe have an average rise time @xmath93 times shorter than the average rise time of bursts in the early universe .",
    "the difference in rise time between emitters of bright and dim bursts could be the result of differences in the interaction of the outbursting source with the surrounding medium .",
    "emitters of dimmer bursts could have interacted in a medium with higher density , or with a harder background emission , or with a stronger average magnetic field , or with a difference of some other global parameter of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "during the back slope there is no difference between bursts from close and distant cosmological distances .",
    "the tails of bursts are thought to represent a self - determined internal process , which has some internal time scale associated either with some inertia , or with a time constant of some decay , or with some other process , and which does not depend on the external condition of the surrounding medium .",
    "a future cosmological model has to take into account these differences between processes of emission during the rising phases of bursts and their decays , which is apparently intrinsic to the co - moving reference frames .",
