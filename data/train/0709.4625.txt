    "single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering off transversely polarized nucleon targets have been under intense experimental and theoretical investigation over the past few years @xcite .",
    "they provide new insights into qcd and the nucleon structure .",
    "for instance , they allow the determination of the third yet - unknown leading - twist quark distribution function @xmath1 , the transversity distribution @xcite .",
    "additionally , they give insight into the parton transverse momentum distribution and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "compass exploited three different `` quark polarimeters '' to access transversity : for hadron production in deep - inelastic scattering the azimuthal asymmetry of the produced hadrons was measured .",
    "this asymmetry gives access to transversity by the collins mechanism .",
    "another probe to access transversity is the interference fragmentation function in the production of hadron pairs @xcite .",
    "finally , for the production of @xmath2 baryons the transverse spin of quarks is transferred to the transverse lambda polarization , which is determined experimentally .    in hard exclusive production of @xmath0 mesons on a transversely polarized target , a different aspect of the spin structure of the nucleon can be probed . since few years",
    "it is well established that hard meson production is a very good candidate to study the universal generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "these distributions describe in the most complete way the nucleon structure and encode fundamental information in particular about the angular momentum carried by partons and about their spatial distribution .    at the compass experiment at cern all channels mentioned above",
    "have been studied .",
    "the following part will focus on two new results , the collins asymmetry for identified z - ordered hadron pairs and the target spin asymmetry for exclusively produced @xmath0 mesons .",
    "at leading twist , the fragmentation function ( @xmath3 ) of a polarized quark into a pair of hadrons is expected to be of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the invariant mass of the hadron pair and @xmath6 is the fraction of available energy carried by the two hadrons .",
    "@xmath7 is the unpolarized fragmentation function into two hadrons .",
    "the angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined according to ref .",
    "@xmath10 is the sum of the azimuthal angle @xmath11 of a plane containing the two hadrons and the azimuthal angle @xmath12 of target spin vector with respect to the lepton scattering plane .",
    "@xmath8 is the polar angle of the first hadron in the two - hadron center - of - mass frame with respect to the direction of the summed hadron momentum @xmath13 . within the compass acceptance , @xmath8 peaks close to @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the following results are obtained by integrating over @xmath16 .",
    "the number of hadron pairs in a bin of @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath5 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 refers to the transverse target spin orientation and @xmath21 is the mean number of detected hadron pairs averaged over @xmath22 . from the angular distribution of the hadron pairs",
    ", one can thus measure the asymmetry @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the target dilution factor , @xmath25 the target polarization and @xmath26 the depolarization factor given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fractional energy transfer of the lepton .",
    "the measured asymmetry can be factorized into a convolution of the transversity distribution @xmath29 of the quarks of flavor @xmath30 and the interference fragmentation @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath32 summed over all quark flavors @xmath30 .",
    "the data discussed here have been taken in the years 2003 to 2004 at the compass experiment at cern .",
    "it scatters a @xmath33 @xmath34 beam on a transversely polarized solid state @xmath35lid target .",
    "the scattered muons and the produced hadrons are detected in a @xmath36  m long large - acceptance forward spectrometer with excellent particle identification capabilities .",
    "a large scale ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) is used to distinguish pions , kaons and protons @xcite .",
    "the event selection was done in the same way as in the previous analysis of the collins and sivers asymmetries for single hadrons @xcite . for the selection of the dis event sample , kinematic cuts of the squared four - momentum transfer @xmath37  ( gev / c)@xmath38 , the hadronic invariant mass @xmath39  gev / c@xmath38 and the fractional energy transfer of the muon @xmath40 were applied .",
    "hadron pairs originating from the primary vertex are selected .",
    "the hadrons are separated into @xmath41 and @xmath42 pairs .",
    "a selection cut of @xmath43 suppresses hadrons from the target fragmentation .",
    "the two leading hadrons have been selected ordered according to their fractional energy , taking the first hadron as the most energetic one .",
    "a cut on the sum @xmath44 rejects exclusively produced @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons .    by combining data from both target cells as well as from sub - periods with opposite target polarization in a double ratio product described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the acceptance function of the spectrometer cancels out and the azimuthal asymmetry @xmath47 is extracted by a fit to the data . in various studies , it was shown that systematic effects of the measurement are considerably smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the data .",
    "in figure [ result1 ] the results for the target single spin asymmetry @xmath48 for identified leading z - ordered @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs are shown .",
    "the asymmetries are plotted as a function of the hadron pair invariant mass @xmath51 .",
    "the measured asymmetries are small and compatible with zero within the statistical precision of the data points .",
    "they do not show a significant dependence on the kinematic variables @xmath51 , or @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .     for identified leading @xmath49 pairs with",

    "in several theoretical models , predictions have been made for the measured asymmetries @xmath52 for pions or unidentified hadrons on a deuteron target @xcite .",
    "the expected values of the asymmetry are generally small and below @xmath53 .",
    "the small signal is attributed in these calculations to a partial cancellation of the asymmetries originating from scattering on @xmath54 and @xmath55 quarks of the proton and neutron in the isoscalar deuteron target . in 2007",
    ", compass is taking data with a transversely polarized proton target , where the asymmetries are expected to be larger @xcite .",
    "together with the deuteron data presented here , a separation of the asymmetries originating from @xmath54 and @xmath55 quarks shall then become possible .",

    "a cut on the squared transverse momentum @xmath59 of the @xmath0 meson in the range between @xmath60 and @xmath61  gev / c@xmath38 has been applied , where the lower limit ensures an accurate measurement of the azimuthal angle and the upper one suppresses non - exclusive background . in total @xmath62 @xmath0 mesons",
    "have been reconstructed .",
    "the selected data sample contains @xmath0 produced incoherently and coherently on the deuteron target as well .",
    "an azimuthal asymmetry @xmath63 has been determined with respect to the angle @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath0 meson with respect to the lepton scattering plane .",
    "the transverse target spin asymmetry has been calculated from the measured asymmetry @xmath63 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dilution factor and @xmath25 the mean target polarization .",
    "results for the asymmetry @xmath68 as a function of the transferred four momentum above threshold @xmath69 , of @xmath17 and of the fractional photon energy transfer @xmath28 are shown in figure [ result2 ] .",
    "for longitudinal virtual photons , factorization of the exclusive vector meson production cross section into a hard part sensitive to gpds and a fragmentation function has been shown @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for transversely polarized photons was shown to be suppressed by @xmath70 compared to the longitudinal one .",
