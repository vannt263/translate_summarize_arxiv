    "many analytical and computational techniques have been developed to study quantum spin models on two - dimensional ( euclidean ) lattices . among such techniques ,",
    "let us mention the corner transfer matrix approach  @xcite , the coordinate bethe ansatz  @xcite , the algebraic bethe ansatz  @xcite , the vertex operator approach  @xcite , including numerical algorithms based on tensor product states and tensor networks  @xcite , all of which have been successfully applied to the description of the energy spectrum and matrix elements of local operators in either integrable lattice models and quantum spin chains or non - integrable quantum spin systems .",
    "however , the task of finding an appropriate approach to analyze the quantum models on hyperbolic lattices , which belongs to challenging problems related to the correspondence between the anti - de sitter space and the conformal field theory  @xcite , still remains an open question of the quantum gravity .",
    "a remarkable demand for an appropriate numerical tool persists .",
    "implementation of the monte carlo simulations fails due to exponential increase of the number of the lattice sites for models on hyperbolic lattices with respect to the expanding lattice size from the lattice center  @xcite .",
    "our desire is to propose a novel and sufficiently accurate numerical algorithm , which originates from the solid state physics and inherits the typical features coming from widely accepted renormalization group approaches , especially based on the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "recently , we modified the tensor product variational formulation ( tpvf )  @xcite , which is an algorithm combining an ansatz for the ground - state in the form of the tensor product state ( tps )  @xcite with the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm can be used to study quantum spin systems in the thermodynamic limit on regular hyperbolic lattices of constant negative gaussian curvature  @xcite .",
    "the hyperbolic lattices are constructed by tessellation of congruent @xmath0-sided polygons ( with the coordination number fixed to four ) .",
    "we applied the modified tpvf algorithm to the euclidean square ( @xmath1 ) and hyperbolic pentagonal ( @xmath2 ) lattices in order to analyze the critical phenomena of the xy , heisenberg and transverse field ising model ( tfim ) . on the square lattice numerical inaccuracy varied from @xmath3 in the xy model to @xmath4 in tfim at the phase transition .",
    "this observation originates in the mean - field - like behavior induced by the tps ansatz , which , as a consequence , can not accurately approximate the correct ground state of the tfim on the two - dimensional euclidean lattice , which belongs to the ising universality class . on the contrary , since the hausdorff dimension of the hyperbolic lattices is infinite , spin models on these lattices belong to the mean - field universality class due to short range correlations , even though the mean - field approximation of the hamiltonian is not applied  @xcite .",
    "we conjectured that tpvf was more suitable for models on the pentagonal hyperbolic lattice due to off - critical and weakly correlated characteristics  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we expand the set of hyperbolic lattices investigated by the tpvf to a series of lattices constructed from congruent @xmath0-sided polygons , where @xmath5 . in analogy to our previous studies of classical spin models on these hyperbolic lattices",
    "@xcite , we expect fast convergence of the phase transition magnetic field of the quantum tfim as well as the ground - state energies of the quantum xy and heisenberg models toward the asymptotic case @xmath6 , which represents the bethe lattice @xcite . numerical results presented in the following sections are in complete agreement with the expectations .",
    "the key feature of this work is the consequent indirect analysis of the quantum tfim , xy , and heisenberg models on the bethe lattice with coordination number four , which has not been considered yet .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the three hamiltonians on the respective hyperbolic lattices and give a brief description of the principles of the tpvf algorithm , which have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "an accurate analysis of the numerical results is presented in sec .",
    "iii and we summarize them in sec .",
    "+   +    we study the ground - state properties and the phase transition of the quantum tfim , xy , and heisenberg models in the thermodynamic limit on a series of hyperbolic lattices .",
    "each hyperbolic lattice is made from equivalent congruent @xmath0-sided polygons .",
    "the polygon vertices coincide with the lattice spin sites , where a single spin is positioned .",
    "each spin site has four nearest - neighboring spin sites , which is commonly referred to as the coordination number equal to four .",
    "we investigate the three models on a set of regular hyperbolic lattices of infinite size with the lattice parameter @xmath7 .",
    "apart from the set , we include two additional cases : @xmath8 being the euclidean square lattice and the asymptotic case @xmath9 , which is associated to the bethe lattice .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] depicts the typical structure of the lattices .",
    "the square lattice serves as a reference lattice .",
    "the three spin models and the tpvf algorithm have been described in detail in  @xcite , and we focus only on the substantial aspects of the models on the hyperbolic lattices in the following .    in general , the hamiltonian @xmath10 of any of the three models can be written as a sum of local hamiltonians @xmath11 of the @xmath0-sided polygonal shape , in particular , @xmath12 where @xmath13 labels the polygons and the sum runs over the set of all indices of the lattice polygons @xmath14 .",
    "the local hamiltonian takes the form @xmath15 \\ , , \\label{hm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 label the spin positions on the @xmath17 @xmath0-sided polygon ( noticing that @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 denote the corresponding pauli spin-@xmath22 operators .",
    "we consider constant nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath23 and a uniform external magnetic field @xmath24 . by setting @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "we obtain the tfim at the transverse magnetic field @xmath24 , whereas the choice @xmath27 gives the xy model and @xmath28 the heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "our task is to calculate an approximate ground - state of the system in the thermodynamic limit in the product form @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the total number of the lattice spins .",
    "the basis @xmath31 for @xmath32 denotes a binary state , for which we use the arrow notation @xmath33 or @xmath34 in the following .",
    "the summation runs over the @xmath35 base spin states @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are the elements of the @xmath0-rank tensor @xmath38 depending on @xmath0 spins @xmath39 on the @xmath40 lattice polygon",
    ". the symbol @xmath41 stands for one of the @xmath42 base configurations of a multi - spin variable representing the group of spins @xmath39 .",
    "all the tensors @xmath38 are considered to be identical , therefore , the set of @xmath42 tensor elements @xmath43 , where the subscript @xmath13 has been omitted due to the uniformity of the tensors @xmath38 , uniquely describes the state @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45\\rangle$ ] .",
    "we regard @xmath46 as the best approximation of the ground - state within the class of tps @xmath47 , if the minimum of the energy normalized per bond , @xmath48 is obtained for @xmath46 . here",
    ", @xmath49 denotes the total number of bonds in the system .",
    "the energy @xmath50 , due to its variational origin , serves as an upper bound of the true ground - state energy per bond @xmath51 .",
    "since the structure of every local hamiltonian @xmath11 does not depend on @xmath13 ( we investigate the system in the thermodynamic limit ) , the variational problem in   is equivalent to minimization of the local energy per bond of an arbitrary polygon in the lattice center ( in order to avoid boundary effects ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the index of the selected polygon and the normalization factor @xmath54 reflects the fact that the @xmath0 bonds of each polygon are shared with its neighbors .",
    "moreover , if we utilize the tensor product structure of the state @xmath47 , we can express the denominator @xmath55 and the numerator @xmath56 as functions of the tensor elements @xmath43 only .",
    "consequently , our variational problem transforms onto a multi - dimensional minimization over @xmath42 tensor elements",
    "@xmath43 @xmath57    furthermore , symmetries of the local hamiltonian @xmath58 may significantly reduce the dimension of the problem .",
    "rotational and spin - ordering symmetries are present in all the three spin models . as a typical example , let us consider a hexagonal lattice ( @xmath59 ) and its particular base configuration of spins on the lattice polygon @xmath60 .",
    "rotational symmetry requires that the tensor elements corresponding to the set of configurations @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are identical to @xmath66 .",
    "next , let us consider a spin - ordering operation , which reverses the order of the polygon spins .",
    "in particular , if the spins are labelled clockwise , the operation reorders them in the anti - clockwise direction .",
    "it means that the configuration @xmath67 is equivalent to @xmath68 by the spin - ordering symmetry and to all the rotations of the latter configuration ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) by a composition of the spin - ordering and the rotational symmetry . as a result , the 12 tensor elements @xmath74 corresponding to the configuration @xmath75 and its 11 equivalent configurations are represented by a single variational parameter , as they share the same value .    by performing a similar analysis on the set of all @xmath42 configurations",
    "@xmath76 we can factorize it into @xmath77 classes of equivalence with representatives @xmath78 , where @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "thus , in case of a system with the rotational and the spin - ordering symmetry ( as in the tfim ) , there are only @xmath77 free variational parameters @xmath80 within the set of @xmath42 tensor elements @xmath43 .",
    "if there is no preferred spin alignment in the system ( such as in the xy model , the heisenberg model , as well as in the tfim at and above the phase transition magnetic field ) , the spin - inversion symmetry appears .",
    "for instance , if @xmath8 , the configuration @xmath81 is equivalent to @xmath82 , which is obtained by flipping each spin .",
    "such an additional symmetry results in consequent reduction of the set of the free variational parameters , the size of which drops to @xmath83 .",
    "the numbers of the free variational parameters @xmath77 and @xmath84 with respect to the lattice parameter @xmath0 are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "in addition , one more variational parameter can be eliminated from each set of the free variational parameters by setting it to @xmath85 , being the normalization condition in @xmath43 and @xmath86 , consequently .",
    ".the numbers of the free variational parameters @xmath84 ( for the xy and the heisenberg models ) and @xmath77 ( for the tfim ) including the normalization parameter . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    another independent way of obtaining ( and confirming ) the phase transition fields @xmath87 can be carried out by analyzing the magnetic susceptibility @xmath88 the functional dependence of the susceptibility on the magnetic field @xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "a non - diverging discontinuity of @xmath89 occurs at the identical phase transition fields @xmath87 , which we have determined above by the spontaneous magnetization analysis and are depicted by the vertical dot - dashed lines .",
    "the inaccuracy comes from performing the second derivative in   numerically , and the additional improvement rests in decreasing the spacing interval @xmath90 , i.e , in shrinking the distance between the magnetic fields , at which the ground - state energy is evaluated by tpvf . in the limit @xmath91 , the magnetic susceptibility undergoes a discontinuous jump at @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that there is no significant difference between the phase transition magnetic fields @xmath87 obtained by the analysis of the transverse magnetization @xmath92 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath89 .    except for the analysis of the phase transition by the spontaneous magnetization @xmath92 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath89",
    ", the field dependence of the set of the optimal free variational parameters @xmath93 also provides helpful information about the phase transition @xmath87 .",
    "the pairs of the optimal variational parameters @xmath93 coupled by spin - inversion symmetry smoothly collapse onto a single curve exactly at the phase transition for all considered lattice geometries .",
    "this process follows the identical behavior as we have presented in  @xcite",
    ". however , due to the large number of the variational parameters @xmath77 , we do not plot the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath93 since the behavior remains qualitatively unchanged .     of the tfim as a function of the magnetic field @xmath24 for the hyperbolic lattices with @xmath94 .",
    "the vertical dot - dashed lines serve as guides for the eye and correspond to the phase transitions @xmath87.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "we have investigated three quantum spin-@xmath22 models ( heisenberg , xy , and tfim ) on a series of hyperbolic lattices by means of the numerical algorithm tensor product variational formulation  @xcite .",
    "the series of lattices is constructed by tessellation of regular @xmath0-sided polygons with the fixed coordination number equal to four , where @xmath95 .",
    "the euclidean square lattice ( @xmath8 ) has been also considered as a reference lattice , although we have discussed in  @xcite that tpvf applied to the models on the square lattice is less accurate than on the hyperbolic lattices ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the ground - state energies @xmath97 of the xy and the heisenberg models have been studied in the absence of magnetic field on the series of the regular lattices with @xmath98 .",
    "since no spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the two models at @xmath99 , the spin - inversion symmetry helps to accelerate the tpvf algorithm due to significant reduction of the number of the free variational parameters .",
    "the resulting dependence of the ground - state energy per bond @xmath97 on the lattice geometry @xmath0 differs considerably for the two models .",
    "while the energies @xmath97 of the xy model form a monotonically increasing and exponentially saturated sequence with increasing @xmath0 , the heisenberg model induces a saw - like dependence containing the separated upper ( odd @xmath0 ) and the lower ( even @xmath0 ) branches , both of them converging exponentially fast to the common asymptotic value @xmath100 which corresponds to the ground - state energy on the bethe lattice with the coordination number four .",
    "we have analyzed the phase transition magnetic fields @xmath87 of the tfim by the expectation value of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath101 , the associated magnetic exponent @xmath102 , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath89 .",
    "we have calculated a sequence of the phase transition magnetic fields @xmath87 , which is a strictly monotonous and increasing function , which converges exponentially to the asymptotic value @xmath103 .",
    "this feature is completely analogous to a fast exponential saturation of the critical temperatures @xmath104 we had observed for the classical ising model on the identical series of hyperbolic lattices in our earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "however , we have not found physical interpretation of this phenomenon yet . the quantum spin systems ( as well as the classical ones ) investigated on the hyperbolic lattices",
    "belong to the mean - field universality class , since infinite hausdorff dimension of the hyperbolic lattice geometry exceeds the critical lattice dimensions @xmath105 ( for quantum models ) and @xmath106 ( for the classical ones ) .",
    "the linearity of the squared magnetization in the vicinity of the phase transition confirms the mean - field - like behavior , in which the associated magnetic exponents @xmath107 .",
    "although the set of the calculated phase transition magnetic fields @xmath87 and the ground - state energies @xmath97 are restricted to @xmath108 , which is far away from the asymptotics @xmath9 , the fast convergence and the exponential character of @xmath87 and @xmath97 with increasing @xmath0 enables to estimate the respective quantities of the quantum spin models on the bethe lattice ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that the phase transition field of the tfim on the bethe lattice is positioned at @xmath110 and the ground - state energies per bond of the xy and the heisenberg models , respectively , occur at @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
