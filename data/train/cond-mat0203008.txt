    "it is known that lipid bilayers ( abound in living cells membranes ) exhibit a ripple phase of the bilayer - water interface , in a narrow temperature range @xcite .",
    "the ripple phase is characterized by permanent wave - like deformations of the interfaces , the origin of which is still a widely debated topic .",
    "however , it was observed that a giant dielectric dispersion can occur in the radiofrequency range , signified by a large dielectric increment in that frequency range @xcite . in practice , these membrane systems are under intensive research because they are responsible for delivery and retention of drugs @xcite .",
    "we aim to obtain some results on the dielectric dispersion spectrum of corrugated membranes , by using our recently developed green s function formalism of periodic interfaces @xcite . in that formalism",
    ", we obtained an analytic expression for the greenian that includes the effect of periodicity . in this work ,",
    "we extend the green s function formalism to compute the local field distribution for a lipid bilayer membrane of arbitrary shape , separating two media of different dielectric constants .",
    "we will calculate the effective dielectric constant of the membrane subject to an ac applied field .",
    "the green s function formalism has been published recently @xcite .",
    "here we re - iterate the formalism to establish notation .",
    "we will apply the formalism to a single interface and then extend to a bilayer membrane . the electrostatic potential satisfies the laplace s equation : @xmath0 = -4\\pi \\rho({\\bf r } ) , \\label{electrostatics}\\end{aligned}\\]]with standard boundary conditions on the interface , where @xmath1 is the free charge density , @xmath2 equals @xmath3 in the host and @xmath4 in the embedding medium .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the volume of the embedding and host medium , separated by an interface @xmath7 . denoting @xmath8 if @xmath9 and 0 otherwise , leads to an integral equation @xcite : @xmath10\\phi({\\bf r } )    = \\phi_0({\\bf r } )        + { u\\over 4\\pi } \\oint_s ds'\\left [ \\hat{\\bf n } '        \\cdot \\nabla ' g({\\bf r } , { \\bf r } ' ) \\right ] \\phi({\\bf r } ' ) , \\label{integral}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is unit normal to @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the solution of @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , our approach aims to solve a surface integral equation for the potential at the expense of a two - step solution @xcite :    1 .",
    "step 1 : determine @xmath16 for all * r * @xmath17 by solving eq.([integral ] ) , and then 2 .",
    "step 2 : obtain @xmath16 for all * r * by using eq.([integral ] ) and the results of step 1 .    in step 1 , we encounter a singularity when the integration variable @xmath18 approaches the point of observation * r*. to circumvent the problem , we take an infinitesimal volume around * r * and perform the surface integral analytically",

    "the ( surface ) integral equation ( [ r_in_s ] ) can be solved for @xmath21 .",
    "here we apply the integral equation formalism to a periodic interface .",
    "suppose the interface profile depends only on @xmath22 , described by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a periodic function of @xmath22 with period @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "without loss of generality , we will let @xmath27 in subsequent studies .",
    "thus medium 1 occupies the space @xmath28 while medium 2 occupies the space @xmath29 separated by the interface at @xmath23 .",
    "the external field is @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the potential . for a periodic system",
    ", @xmath16 is a periodic function of the lattice vector @xmath32 . in what follows ,",
    "we adopt similar treatment as the korringa , kohn and rostoker ( kkr ) method @xcite and rewrite the integral equation as : @xmath33where the integration is performed within a _ unit cell_. the structure green s function ( greenian ) is given by @xcite : @xmath34we were able to evaluate the greenian analytically @xcite : @xmath35 \\over                  \\cos 2\\pi ( x - x ' ) - \\cosh 2\\pi ( y - f(x ' ) ) } .",
    "\\label{greenian}\\end{aligned}\\]]eq.([greenian ] ) is a truly remarkable result  the analytic expression is valid for an arbitrary interface profile .",
    "if the point of observation @xmath36 is located at the interface , the greenian has a finite limit as @xmath37 : @xmath38we first solve eq.([unit - cell ] ) for the potential @xmath39 right at the interface : @xmath40then we use eq.([integral ] ) to find the potential at any arbitrary point @xmath41 , using the potential at the interface .",

    "as @xmath56 , the volume integration can be converted into a surface integration by the green s theorem . moreover , for the upper ( lower ) profile , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , thus the effective dielectric constant becomes @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to solve the integral equation , we express the potential at an arbitrary point into a mode expansion : @xmath58where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are mode functions .",
    "the potential on the interfaces suffices : @xmath61where @xmath62 . here",
    "we make a few remarks on the choice of the mode functions .",
    "the choice of the mode function is somewhat arbitrary in theory . in practice",
    ", these functions should be simple and easy to use .",
    "common choice ranges from extended mode functions like the fourier series expansions to localized mode functions like the step and triangular functions @xcite . substituting the mode expansion eq.([mode - a ] ) into eq.([unit - cell ] ) , the coefficients @xmath63 satisfy the matrix equation : @xmath64   { \\bf a } = -e_0 { \\bf v},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath65it should be remarked that the mode functions need not be orthonormal and the matrix b is non - diagonal in general .",
    "as a model bilayer membrane , we adopt the interface profiles : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the amplitude of corrugation , and the sine function is added to upset the reflection symmetry about @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the width of the bilayer membrane is thus unity .",
    "we adopt the step functions for the mode expansions : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the width of the step function . in what follows",
    ", we adopt 100 step functions both for the lower and upper profiles , equally spaced in the unit interval @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the integrals eqs.(16)(18 ) can be readily performed .",
    "to study the dielectric behavior , we apply an ac field at a frequency @xmath72 .",
    "the embedded medium inside the membrane has a complex dielectric constant @xmath73 where @xmath4 and @xmath74 are the dielectric constant and conductivity of the embedded medium respectively , with @xmath72 being the frequency of the applied field .",

    "the maxwell - wagner relaxation time of a planar interface is given by : @xmath78 in fig.[fig1 ] , we plot ( a ) the real and ( b ) imaginary parts of the complex effective dielectric constant @xmath54 normalized to @xmath3 as function of frequency for various amplitude of corrugation @xmath67 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 . as is evident from fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", there is a giant dielectric dispersion as the amplitude of corrugation becomes large ( @xmath79 ) .    in summary ,",
    "we have employed the green s function formalism to study the dielectric behavior of a corrugated membrane . the integral equation is solved and the dielectric dispersion spectrum is obtained for a periodic corrugated membrane .",
    "we should remark that the present formalism can readily be generalized to multi - layers systems as well as corrugations in two dimensions @xcite .",
