    "this paper deals with the real hardy space @xmath0 in the rational dunkl setting , where the underlying space is of homogeneous type in the sense of coifman - weiss .",
    "in such a setting , the theory of hardy spaces goes back to the seventies @xcite .",
    "here we follow uchyama s approach @xcite and we characterize the hardy space @xmath0 in two ways , by means of the heat maximal operator and atomically . the first characterization , which requires precise heat kernel estimates , has lead us to a seemingly new observation , namely that the heat kernel has a rather slow decay in certain directions and is in particular not gaussian in the present setting ( see remark [ decayremark ] ) .",
    "the second characterization is used to prove a fourier multiplier theorem for @xmath0 .    throughout the paper we shall restrict to the one - dimensional case and to the product case .",
    "this restriction is due to our present lack of knowledge in general about the behavior of the dunkl kernel on the one hand and about generalized translations on the other hand .",
