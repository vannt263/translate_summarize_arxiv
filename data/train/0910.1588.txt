    "dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most active research areas in the interdisciplinary context of particle physics , astroparticle physics , and cosmology today . in recent years",
    ", experiments and observations have resulted in compelling evidence for the existence of non - baryonic dm .",
    "a good fit to experimental data is obtained if it is assumed that the dm is cold , _",
    "i.e. _ , non - relativistic at the epoch of matter - radiation equality , and that there is a cosmological constant accounting for the observed present expansion of the universe .",
    "an analysis combining the five - year wmap data , baryon acoustic oscillations , and supernova observations indicates that the dm has a density of @xmath2 ( 68 % cl ) @xcite . to date",
    ", all evidence for dm comes from gravitational interactions , and its particle nature remains unknown .",
    "in particular , none of the particles in the current standard model ( sm ) of particle physics could constitute the dm .",
    "hence , the search for a dm candidate is strongly connected to physics beyond the sm .",
    "an important class of dm candidates constitutes weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are weakly interacting particles with masses in the range @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for the importance of wimps as dm candidates is that if they are assumed to be thermally produced in the early universe , the measured present relic dm density can be easily obtained without any further strong assumptions on their properties .",
    "several currently operating or planned experiments aim to detect wimps .",
    "this could be done either directly by measuring the recoil of atoms from their elastic scattering on wimps @xcite or indirectly by detecting products of pair annihilations or decays of wimps , such as gamma rays , neutrinos , and antimatter .    through their interactions with nuclei ,",
    "wimps in the solar system scatter elastically in the sun , thereby losing energy and becoming trapped in the solar gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , the local dm density in the sun can exceed the average density by several orders of magnitude , and hence , the sun could be an interesting source of wimp annihilation products . in this context ,",
    "only neutrinos are of interest , since they have a sufficiently low interaction strength to be able to escape the dense medium of the sun .",
    "these neutrinos can be searched for in neutrino telescopes on earth , such as the amanda / icecube @xcite , antares @xcite , and super - kamiokande @xcite experiments .",
    "an interesting type of wimps is kaluza ",
    "klein dark matter ( kkdm ) @xcite , which arises in certain models of extra dimensions .",
    "in particular , universal extra dimensions ( ued ) models @xcite , where all the particles of the sm are allowed to propagate in one or more extra dimensions , could include several different candidates . in these models ,",
    "a remnant of translational invariance in the extra dimensions gives rise to a multiplicatively conserved quantum number known as kaluza ",
    "klein parity , forcing the total kk number entering any vertex to be even .",
    "this symmetry is similar to @xmath4-parity in supersymmetric models , and it ensures that the lightest kaluza  klein particle ( lkp ) is stable . if neutral , the lkp could be a good dm candidate , analogously to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) @xcite .    in the ued models , the mass spectrum of the kk particles , and",
    "in particular , the identity of the lkp , depends on specific assumptions on the model at the cutoff scale , where the theory breaks down . in the most",
    "widely studied five - dimensional model , known as the minimal universal extra dimensions ( mued ) model , the lkp has been determined to be the first kk mode of the @xmath0 gauge boson by calculating radiative corrections to the tree - level masses of the kk excitations @xcite . however , as has explicitly been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , other assumptions could change this conclusion .",
    "the most stringent constraints to date set on the five - dimensional mued model of kkdm are given by the icecube collaboration @xcite , using the 22-string configuration .",
    "when completed with in total 80 strings , icecube will have the ability to set even stronger constraints on the model .    in this paper , we calculate muon fluxes induced by neutrinos coming from annihilation of kkdm in the sun .",
    "we study different lkp candidates in a five- as well as a six - dimensional model .",
    "we use the darksusy @xcite and wimpsim @xcite packages to properly treat the capture rates , the interactions of the annihilation products in the sun , and the propagation of neutrinos to the earth , and to simulate the interactions of neutrinos in the detector medium on earth .",
    "neutrinos from kkdm annihilations in the sun have previously been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and recently in ref .  @xcite . in comparison to those works",
    ", we use a more careful treatment , and we find relatively small differences when comparing the results . to our knowledge , the only study of neutrinos from kkdm annihilations in the sun in a six - dimensional model has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    ", only the mued model is investigated , and it is concluded that no observable neutrino telescope signal is obtained .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : wimpann ] , we describe the formalism of wimp annihilations in the sun , and how this is implemented in darksusy and wimpsim . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we introduce the extra - dimensional models that we investigate . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our results in the form of muon fluxes in a neutrino telescope on earth and compare these to the existing results in the literature . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] , we summarize and discuss our results . in addition , technical details are provided in the appendices .",
    "the evolution of the total number of wimps in the interior of the sun , @xmath5 , is governed by the equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the capture rate of wimps in the sun and @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the total wimp pair annihilation cross section , @xmath10 is the relative wimp velocity , and @xmath11 are effective volumes @xcite .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "is @xmath12 where @xmath13 sets the equilibration time scale for the process of capture and annihilation .",
    "the annihilation rate is given by @xmath14 which is the expression that is used in darksusy .",
    "for times @xmath15 , @xmath16 , _ i.e. _ , the annihilation rate is determined by the capture rate only . in that case , the only important aspect of the wimp - wimp annihilation cross sections are the relative branching ratios into different channels .",
    "the capture rate of wimps in the sun is governed by the elastic wimp - proton scattering cross section . in the non - relativistic limit , which is applicable for scattering of cold dm",
    ", the interactions between wimps and atoms can be characterized as either spin - dependent or spin - independent .",
    "spin - independent cross sections are proportional to the square of the atomic number @xmath17 , while spin - dependent cross sections are proportional to the square of the angular momentum , @xmath18 @xcite .    for the wimps that we will consider , the spin - dependent cross section is much larger than the spin - independent one .",
    "the capture rate of wimps in the sun is then commonly approximated by the expression @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the local dm density , @xmath21 is the root - mean - square of the dm velocity dispersion , @xmath22 is the spin - dependent elastic wimp - proton scattering cross section , and @xmath23 is the mass of the wimp .    in darksusy , a more accurate result for the capture rate is obtained by dividing the sun into shells and numerically integrating over these shells , as well as the velocity distribution of the wimps .",
    "we use the darksusy default values for the wimp population , which is a gaussian velocity distribution with root - mean - square velocity dispersion @xmath24 , and local density @xmath25 . for more details on the calculation of the capture rate , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : capture ] , we show the ratio of the result obtained from eq .   to the one obtained from darksusy . for this figure",
    ", we use @xmath26 , which is the spin - dependent cross section for a @xmath27 wimp with @xmath28 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the results from eq .",
    "are larger than the ones from darksusy by about @xmath29 , with the larger difference at the lowest mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the larger cross section .",
    "we have used the spin - dependent elastic scattering cross section @xmath26.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    since the capture rate is proportional to the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section , which is also the quantity that is measured in direct detection experiments , the results of neutrino telescope searches and direct detection experiments are expected to be correlated @xcite . in particular , as stronger limits are set on the wimp - nucleon cross sections by direct detection experiments , the prospects of detecting neutrinos from wimp annihilations decrease .    in direct detection experiments ,",
    "the spin - independent interactions are easier to measure , since a large scattering cross section can be obtained by using heavy target nuclei @xcite .",
    "hence , the limits on the cross sections are stronger for spin - independent interactions than for spin - dependent ones .",
    "the current strongest limits on spin - independent cross sections are set by the cdms @xcite and xenon10 @xcite experiments .",
    "the cdms upper limit on the scattering cross section for a 60 gev wimp is @xmath30pb at 90 % c.l .",
    "these constraints are strong enough to rule out an observation of neutrinos from annihilations of dm in any running or planned neutrino telescope , if the dm only interacts spin - independently @xcite .",
    "the most stringent constraints on the spin - dependent cross sections from direct detection experiments are set by xenon10 @xcite , coupp @xcite , and kims @xcite for scattering on protons and by xenon10 @xcite , cdms @xcite , and zeplin iii @xcite for scattering on neutrons .",
    "the xenon10 results constrain the wimp - neutron spin - dependent cross section to be less than @xmath31 for a @xmath32 wimp , whereas the kims results constrain the corresponding cross section for protons to be less than @xmath33 for an @xmath34 wimp .",
    "in contrast to the limits on the spin - independent cross sections , these constraints are weak enough to allow for a sufficiently strong signal in neutrino telescopes . it is interesting to note that for the case of spin - dependent scattering on protons , icecube @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite have already obtained stronger constraints in some regions of parameter space through indirect detection .    in conclusion , it is especially interesting to use neutrino telescopes to search for dm candidates , which mainly have spin - dependent interactions with nuclei . in particular , scalar dm can not have spin - dependent interactions , and hence , that class of dm candidates is not interesting in this context .",
    "once the annihilation rate and branching ratios of the dm annihilations are known , we can proceed by computing the resulting neutrino signals in an earth based detector . in addition to the geometric scaling of the flux by @xmath35 , the neutrino flux is subject to interactions with the solar medium as well as matter - enhanced flavor oscillations within the sun , while the propagation from the solar surface to the earth is only affected by neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "the consistent theoretical treatment of simultaneous neutrino interactions and oscillations is through the introduction of the neutrino density matrix @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the neutrino energy .",
    "this matrix describes the energy - dependent neutrino flavor composition at a distance @xmath38 from the center of the sun and follows the evolution equation @xmath39 - \\frac{\\rm i}{2 } \\{\\gamma,\\rho\\ } + \\left.{\\frac{{\\rm d}\\rho}{{\\rm d}r}}\\right|_{\\rm nc } + \\left.{\\frac{{\\rm d}\\rho}{{\\rm d}r}}\\right|_{\\rm cc},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the neutrino oscillation hamiltonian , @xmath41 is a diagonal matrix containing the interaction rates of the different flavors with the medium , and the two last terms are regeneration terms due to neutral- and charged - current interactions , respectively . in general , the neutral - current regeneration term is simply a decrease of the neutrino energy @xmath37 , since the neutral current is flavor blind , while the charged - current regeneration term projects out the tau - neutrino component of the scattering , since only taus decay before stopping in the sun . for the specific form of the regeneration terms , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we use the results of the wimpsim package @xcite , which provides an event - based monte carlo simulation that allows us to compute the neutrino signal in a detector , including all of the effects mentioned above .",
    "the oscillations and interactions in the sun are treated in a consistent framework which can be easily shown to have the same properties as the density matrix evolution described above .",
    "furthermore , the results from wimpsim have been tabulated and are included in darksusy , thus greatly simplifying our implementation .",
    "finally , we compute the resulting muon - antimuon flux at the detector through the standard darksusy routines .",
    "this flux can then be compared to the experimental limits in order to rule out models or to see what kind of sensitivity that would be needed to discover the indirect neutrino signal @xcite .",
    "we investigate the signals of a five- as well as a six - dimensional ued model . for both cases ,",
    "we choose the models most commonly studied in the literature , though we allow for a more general mass spectrum than that of the mued models .",
    "each model is based on the sm gauge group @xmath42 and includes the minimal particle content necessary to reproduce the sm in the low - energy limit .    for simplicity , we follow the usual practice of ignoring electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) effects . in particular , we treat all the sm particles as massless .",
    "we also neglect the yukawa couplings , which are small compared to the gauge couplings .",
    "since we ignore ewsb effects , we use a gauge where all four components of the higgs field appear as physical states . finally ,",
    "none of the processes that we study involve the self - coupling of the higgs boson , and hence , we ignore this interaction .",
    "it should be noted that any extra - dimensional field theory is non - renormalizable , and hence , it can only be viewed as an effective theory .",
    "thus , the models that we study are only valid up to some cutoff scale @xmath43 , at which some more fundamental ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the model is needed .",
    "the possible effects from physics at the cutoff scale are discussed below .      in five dimensions ,",
    "spinors are four - component objects , as in four dimensions . however , there is no chirality operator @xcite , and hence , the dirac representation is irreducible , _",
    "i.e. _ , all fermions are four - component dirac fermions .",
    "this implies that the simplest choice of geometry for the fifth dimension , the circle @xmath44 , does not reproduce the sm in the low - energy limit .",
    "this problem can be solved by replacing the circle by the orbifold @xmath45 , which is obtained from @xmath44 by identifying the points @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath46 is the coordinate along the circle . for the action to be invariant under this transformation , the five - dimensional fields have to be either even or odd in @xmath46 .",
    "the kk expansion for an even field is @xmath48,\\ ] ] and for an odd field @xmath49 in particular , an odd field does not have a zero mode , and hence , the field is not present in the low - energy theory , which only contains the zero modes . the left- and right - handed parts of a five - dimensional dirac field can be given opposite transformation properties , in which case it will have a definite chirality in the low - energy limit .",
    "the model can then be made compatible with the sm by introducing such a dirac field for each chiral fermion in the sm . for a sm fermion @xmath50",
    ", we denote the dirac fermion corresponding to the left - handed part by @xmath51 and that corresponding to the right - handed part by @xmath52 . in general , the weak eigenstates @xmath52 and @xmath51 mix to form massive eigenstates , but the mixing is proportional to the mass of the corresponding sm fermion , and hence , we neglect it .    the orbifolding procedure introduces additional complications to the model .",
    "the orbifold @xmath45 has two fixed points , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is the radius of the circle .",
    "in general , terms localized to these points , so - called boundary localized terms ( blts ) , can be included in the lagrangian .",
    "these terms affect the spectrum and the coupling constants of the model already at tree level .",
    "it has been shown that blts are generated by radiative corrections @xcite , and hence , it is inconsistent not to include them .",
    "the blts break translational invariance in the fifth dimension , and hence , the fifth component of the momentum vector is not conserved . however , if the blts appear symmetrically between the fixed points , there is a remaining mirror symmetry , and correspondingly , a multiplicatively conserved quantum number , called kk parity @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the kk number , and it is analogous to @xmath4-parity in supersymmetric theories @xcite . in particular , it ensures that the lkp is stable . in this work",
    ", we always assume that kk parity is conserved .",
    "in contrast to the bulk terms , the blts are not determined by the sm parameters . in principle , all such terms that are allowed by the sm gauge symmetry should be included , and _ a priori _ , nothing can be said about these terms , except what constraints can be put on them from experiments @xcite . hence , their existence decreases the predictivity of the model .",
    "the common solution to this problem is to assume that the blts vanish at the cut - off scale @xmath43 of the theory . in the resulting model ,",
    "usually referred to as the mued model , there are only two free parameters in addition to the sm parameters , namely the compactification radius @xmath4 and the cut - off scale @xmath43 .",
    "the procedure is similar to the fixing of supersymmetry breaking parameters by making an ansatz at the scale of grand unification , such as msugra @xcite .",
    "however , as long as nothing is known regarding the uv completion of the ued model , the mued ansatz is arbitrary and only made for simplicity .",
    "our approach to the blts is similar to that given in ref .",
    "we do not investigate the effects of individual terms , but assume that the spectrum is affected in such a way as to give different lkps .",
    "for simplicity , the possible effects on the couplings are not taken into account .",
    "gauge fields in higher - dimensional theories have an extra component for each additional dimension .",
    "thus , in the five - dimensional case , each gauge field has a single extra component , @xmath57 . from the four - dimensional point of view",
    ", the zero mode of this field would appear as a massless scalar , which would be in conflict with experimental results , since no such scalar has been found .",
    "hence , the only phenomenologically viable option is to take @xmath57 to be odd in @xmath46 , so that it does not have a zero mode .",
    "on the other hand , the four components @xmath58 have to be even in order to reproduce the sm at low energies .    for the higgs doublet , we use the convention @xmath59 and the conjugate of @xmath60 is denoted by @xmath61 . as in the sm ,",
    "the zero modes @xmath62 and @xmath63 are eaten by the @xmath64 and @xmath65 bosons , respectively .",
    "for @xmath66 , on the other hand , @xmath67 and @xmath68 mix with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and for each pair , one linear combination is eaten to give mass to the corresponding kk mode of a gauge boson , while the orthogonal combination survives as a physical scalar .",
    "however , the mixing is proportional to @xmath71 , where @xmath10 is the higgs vacuum expectation value , and since we ignore ewsb effects , there is no mixing .",
    "this means that the scalar that is eaten is the fifth component of the gauge boson , while all four components of the higgs boson appear as physical scalars at each non - zero kk level .    at each kk level , the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath72 and @xmath73 mix to form two massive eigenstates , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , in the same way as in the sm .",
    "however , in the ued model , the mass matrix in flavor basis at the @xmath56th level is given by @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are corrections to the tree - level masses .",
    "for @xmath66 , there are large contributions to the diagonal entries , and the mass matrix is almost diagonal . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the first - level weinberg angle is bounded as @xmath80 , and we can make the approximation @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we use the basis @xmath83 , although the @xmath84 basis is sometimes used in the literature .",
    "we also ignore the effects of the kk modes above the first level .",

    "these new rules are listed in appendix [ sec : feynmanrules6d ] .      in comparison to the five - dimensional model , each kk level in the six - dimensional model also includes an adjoint scalar for each gauge boson . in particular , the first - level adjoint scalars @xmath140 and @xmath141 are neutral , and therefore , they are possible dm candidates . however ,",
    "being scalars , these candidates are not interesting for our purposes .",
    "it has been shown that in the mued version of the model , the adjoint scalar @xmath140 is the lkp @xcite .",
    "thus , it is necessary to go beyond the mued scenario in order to possibly obtain a neutrino telescope signal .",
    "we conclude that the interesting lkp candidates in the six - dimensional model are the same as in five dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath27 and the @xmath92 .",
    "the elastic wimp - proton scattering cross sections for @xmath27 and @xmath92 lkps in the five - dimensional model have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results are @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath144 . in eq .  , the contributions from @xmath145- and @xmath146-channel exchange of left - handed kk quarks has been neglected .",
    "these contributions would increase the cross section by about 3 % , while introducing an additional free parameter , @xmath147 . on the other hand , in eq .",
    ", there is no contribution from the right - handed kk quarks , since the @xmath90 boson couples only to left - handed chiral fermions . in the six - dimensional model ,",
    "there are no tree - level contributions to these cross sections from the adjoint scalars , and hence , eqs .   and are valid also for that model .",
    "the relic dm density was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for both @xmath27 and @xmath92 in the five - dimensional model .",
    "these calculations include coannihilations in all channels , and were performed for a relative mass splitting @xmath148 between the lkp and the kk quarks in the region from 0.01 to 0.5 . for the @xmath27 calculations ,",
    "the mued spectrum was used for the rest of the first - level kk particles , and for the @xmath92 , it was assumed that the @xmath149 are degenerate with @xmath92 , that the kk gluons are heavier by 20 % , and that all other first - level kk particles are heavier by 10 % .",
    "the conclusion is , that in order to obtain the measured relic density , the mass of the @xmath27 should be roughly in the range @xmath91 , depending on the relative mass splitting @xmath150 , and the mass of the @xmath92 should be roughly in the range @xmath151 . for the @xmath27 , the preferred mass decreases with increasing mass splitting , while for the @xmath92 , the opposite is true .",
    "since the interactions in the six - dimensional model are the same as those in the five - dimensional one , the only possible difference in the relic density would come from coannihilations involving adjoint scalars . in this work",
    ", we ignore that contribution , and assume that the relevant mass intervals for the respective candidates are approximately the same as for the five - dimensional model .",
    "using the annihilation cross sections presented in appendix [ sec : crosssections ] , we calculate the branching ratios into different final states , which are presented in tab .",
    "[ tbl : brs ] .",
    "the branching ratios into a pair of higgs bosons are small , and give only a small contribution to the muon - antimuon fluxes . since this channel would introduce additional model dependence , we choose to neglect it in our calculations .",
    ".the branching ratios for pair annihilation of @xmath27 and @xmath92 lkps . except for the lkp and the kk quarks ,",
    "the masses of the kk particles are assumed to be larger than the lkp mass by 10 % , except for the @xmath149 , which are assumed to be degenerate with @xmath92 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      @xmath152",
    "in this appendix , we present the relevant wimp - wimp annihilation cross sections for the models that we consider . the relevant quantity for our calculations is the cross section times relative velocity , @xmath153 , in the static limit @xmath154 .",
    "we refer to this quantity as the cross section .",
    "we let the masses of all first - level kk particles be free parameters .",
    "since we ignore ewsb effects , all the higgs components appear as physical particles and the symbols @xmath65 and @xmath64 refer only to the transversal components of those gauge bosons . to calculate the scattering rate into a pair of physical ( massive ) gauge bosons , the two contributions should be added .",
    "for example , the cross section for the annihilation of two @xmath92 bosons into a @xmath155 pair is given by the sum @xmath156 .",
    "since we ignore all sm masses , we simplify the notation by suppressing the kk - indices , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath157 , _ etc_. in order to further simplify the notation , we also introduce the functions @xmath158 @xmath159 and @xmath160    the annihilation cross sections for the @xmath27 are @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the number of colors of the fermion @xmath50 , @xmath163 in the case of degenerate first - level kk masses , the total annihilation cross section is @xmath164"
