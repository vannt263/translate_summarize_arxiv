    "[ sec - i ] the photoelectric effect was discovered in increasingly precise experiments by hertz @xcite , hallwachs @xcite , lenard @xcite , and millikan @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , when light is incident on a metal surface , electrons are ejected from the surface . the striking fact about this phenomenon is the seemingly odd dependence of the maximal kinetic energy @xmath1 of the ejected electrons on the frequency of the light and its independence of the light intensity .",
    "the latter contradicts the principles of classical physics , and in 1905 , einstein suggested an explanation of this phenomenon @xcite which explicitly involves the _ quantum _ nature of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "he found that @xmath2 provided that the frequency @xmath3 of the light times planck s constant @xmath4 , i.e. , the photon energy @xmath5 is larger than the ( material dependent ) work function @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath7 then no electrons leave the metal surface .",
    "our ultimate goal is the derivation of einstein s predictions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq - i-1])([eq - i-2 ] ) , from first principles of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze a simplified model which is far from the appropriate model for a metal interacting with electromagnetic radiation and can , at best , be regarded as a caricature of a hydrogen atom interacting with the radiation field .",
    "yet , it contains many of the mathematical difficulties we expect to encounter in the analysis of a more realistic model , and we prove eqs .",
    "( [ eq - i-1])([eq - i-2 ] ) for this simplified model .",
    "our emphasis lies in the following aspects :    * given the model as described in sect .",
    "[ subsec - i-1 ] , below , our derivation is mathematically rigorous , and no unjustified approximations are used . to our knowledge",
    ", the present paper is the first to treat the photoelectric effect with mathematical rigor . + we draw from many facts about nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics which have been previously established in @xcite .",
    "+ as we propose to study the _ charge transported to infinity _ ( see sect .  [ subsec - i-2 ] ) which involves the asymptotics of the unitary time evolution operator @xmath8 , as @xmath9 , our results can be viewed as part of scattering theory for models of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics .",
    "results in this context , but on other aspects can be found in @xcite . * while our model for the particle system , i.e. , the metal or atom , is a crude model involving only a single , spinless electron , the particle system is coupled to a _",
    "quantized _ scalar field .",
    "( the difference between the quantized [ vector ] electromagnetic and a quantized scalar field is irrelevant , for the scope of this work . for certain other facts in nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics , however , this difference is crucial , see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "* our model describes a single atom rather than a metal or even a gas interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus our derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - i-1])([eq - i-2 ] ) shows that the photoelectric effect is not a collective , statistical phenomenon , visible only if _",
    "many _ particles or _",
    "photons are involved .",
    "most texts on laser theory or quantum optics , e.g. , @xcite , immediately proceed to a statistical description of both the metal or gas of atoms , say , and the photon field , and the question , whether this is really necessary or merely a matter of mathematical convenience , is left open . * within our framework , we prove eqs .",
    "( [ eq - i-1])([eq - i-2 ] ) to be correct in leading nonvanishing order in the coupling parameter @xmath10 which , in appropriate units , equals @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fine structure constant .",
    "more precisely , given the interacting atom at rest plus an incident photon cloud consisting of @xmath0 photons , we show that to leading order the contribution to the charge ejected from the atom is _ additive _ in each photon and _ independent _ of all other photons of the incident photon cloud .",
    "moreover , we prove that this contribution is in accordance with ( [ eq - i-1])([eq - i-2 ] ) in case that the photons are in an incoming scattering state .",
    "in fact , the leading order contribution to the ejected charge resembles the first term in the born series for the t - matrix ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "* while it is customary to restrict the analysis of the photoelectric effect to a single photon scattering off the atom or metal , we point out that it is important to consider more than one photon , @xmath13 , because for a photon state consisting of a single photon only , total energy and energy of each single photon involved agree . hence ,",
    "if studying a single photon state , it is impossible to say whether the ejection of electrons is proportional to the total energy of the photon cloud or depends on the maximal energy of all photons in the photon cloud .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ subsec - i-1 ] below we introduce the mathematical model for the photoelectric effect .",
    "this includes a precise description of the atom , the photons , and their interaction in terms of a semibounded , selfadjoint generator of the dynamics , the hamiltonian .    in sect .",
    "[ subsec - i-2 ] we then describe our main results . in subsects .",
    "[ subsubsec - i-2 - 1][subsubsec - i-2 - 2 ] , we introduce the main quantities dealt with in this paper , the charge transported to infinity and photon clouds , and in subsect .",
    "[ subsubsec - i-2 - 3 ] , we derive the asymptotics of the former to leading order in the coupling constant .",
    "a limit of monochromatic light is discussed in subsect .",
