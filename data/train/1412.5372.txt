    "1 shows the system model of a two - tier femtocell network .",
    "a macrocell network consists of multiple macrocells that share the same bandwidth .",
    "a macrocell covers a regular circular region @xmath0 with radius @xmath1 and a macrocell base station ( bs ) is located in the center of the circle .",

    "a femtocell bs has @xmath5 channels which are classified into two types : one type of channels is open in the sense that they can be used by all users ; the other type of channels is called closed channels which can only be used by femtocell users .",
    "the number of open femtocell channels is denoted by @xmath6 and the number of closed femtocell channels then becomes @xmath7 in a femtocll .",
    "we consider two kinds of users in the two - tier femtocell networks : macrocell users and femtocell users .",
    "macrocell users can access all unoccupied macrocell channels and unoccupied open femtocell channels when macrocell users are located in corresponding coverage areas of these femtocells .",
    "femtocell users can access all unoccupied macrocell channels and unoccupied femtocell channels in which these femotocell users are located . within a specific femtocell",
    ", a femtocell user accesses the channels in the following order : a femtocell user will first access an unoccupied closed femtocell channel if there exists an unoccupied closed femtocell channel in the specific femtocell ; a femtocell user will access an unoccupied open femtocell channel if all closed femtocell channels are busy and there exists an unoccupied open femtocell channel in the specific femtocell . finally , the femtocell user will access an unoccupied macrocell channel if all closed femtocell channels and open femtocell channels are busy in the specific femtocell .",

    "in this section , the number of occupied femtocell channels in a femtocell is first modeled by a markov chain . by analyzing the markov chain model , the blocking probabilities for a femtocell user and a macrocell user are derived , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the stationary state probabilities of the markov chain model are derived to analyze the spectrum and energy efficiency of femtocell networks in the next section .      to simplify the analysis using the markov chain model , femtocells in a macrocell",
    "are considered as a homogeneous system where all femtocells have the same equipment parameters .",
    "furthermore , this homogeneous system is assumed to be in a statistical equilibrium , which means the average hand - off arrival rate to a femtocell is equal to the corresponding hand - off departure rate .",

    "2 , the average dynamic energy consumption is derived as follows @xmath143    it is very important to study the spectrum and energy efficiency from a systematic perspective . for this",
    ", we introduce a new performance metric _ the utility function of energy efficiency _ , which is defined as the ratio of the total capacity in a femtocell to the average total energy consumption in a femtocell bs .",
    "let @xmath144 denote the utility function of energy efficiency .",
    "then , we have @xmath145    based on ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) , the energy efficiency model can be further derived as follows ( 32 ) .",
    "in this subsections numerical and mc simulations are presented to demonstrate interactions between the femtocell energy efficiency metrics and critical performance - impacting parameters .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the following parameters are used in the numerical and mc simulations : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "first , we fix the number of total femtocell channels @xmath150 and the number of open femtocell channels @xmath151 . fig .",
    "6 illustrates the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell networks in terms of the average number of femtocells users with different number of femtocells in a macrocell , in which `` num '' labels the numerical results and `` mc '' represents the mc simulation results .",
    "when the number of femtocells in a macrocell is fixed , the spectrum efficiency increases with an increase in the average number of users in a femtocell .",
    "when the average number of users in a femtocell is fixed , the spectrum efficiency of femtocell networks decreases with an increase in the number of femtocells in a macrocell . fig .",
    "7 shows the energy efficiency of the femtocell networks in terms of the average number of femtocell users with different number of femtocells in a macrocell .",

    "these numerical results are validated in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "7 , which demonstrate good accuracy of the results .",
    "secondly , we fix the number of open femtocell channels @xmath151 and the average number of users as 4 in a femtocell . fig . 8",

    "it is observed that the spectrum efficiency increases with an increase in the number of closed channels in a femtocell .",
    "in addition , when the number of closed channels is fixed , the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell networks decreases with an increase in the number of femtocells in a macrocell . fig .",

    "the numerical results are validated by the mc simulation results shown in fig . 8 and fig .",
    "however , the mc simulation curves are less than the numerical curves in fig . 8 and fig . 9 . considering that the mc simulation results are realized by finite simulation calculations , a few mc simulation calculation values with small probabilities will be discarded in the final results .    in the end",
    ", we fix the number of closed femtocell channels to be 2 and the number of femtocells in a macrocell to be 25 for the following simulation . fig .",
    "10 shows the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell networks in terms of the average number of femtocell users with different number of open channels in a femtocell . in this example , the number of total channels in a femtocell is set as 8 .",
    "we can see that the spectrum efficiency of the femtocell networks increases with an increase in the average number of users in a femtocell .",
    "when the average number of users is fixed in a femtocell , the spectrum efficiency increases with an increase in the number of open channels in a femtocell .",
    "11 shows the energy efficiency of the femtocell networks in terms of the average number of femtocell users with different open channels in a femtocell .",
    "the curves show that the energy efficiency increases with an increase in the average number of users in a femtocell and the energy efficiency decreases with an increase in the number of open channels in a femtocell . according to the energy efficiency model in ( 32 ) , the average dynamic energy consumption linearly increases with an increase in the number of open femtocell channels but the total capacity of a femtocell only increases logarithmically with an increase in the number of open femtocell channels .",
    "therefore , when the number of open femtocell channels increases , the energy efficiency decreases . based on results of fig .",
    "8 - 11 , our analytical models and simulation results indicate that an increase in the number of open or closed femtocell channels can conduce to the increase of spectrum efficiency and the decrease of energy efficiency in a two - tier femtocell networks . as a consequence ,",

    "furthermore , spectrum and energy efficiency models are proposed for two - tier femtocell networks with partially open channels .",
    "simulation results have shown the impacts of critical parameters on the two - tier femtocell networks , including the number of femtocell users , the number of femtocells in a macrocell , and the number of open or closed channels in a femtocell .",
    "our analysis indicates that the spectrum and energy efficiency of two - tier femtocell networks can be traded off by configuring different numbers of open channels in a femtocell .",
