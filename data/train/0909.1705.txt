    "however , according to eq .",

    "there could be of course oscillations or peaks in the transmission even in this case but those would not have the simple periodicity that focusing peaks have .",
    "let us now briefly discuss some of the details of our numerical calculations for the transmission probability @xmath6 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main ] .",
    "the injector and the collector were modeled by heavily doped graphene and the transmission was calculated employing the green s function technique of ref .  .",
    "the graphene nanoribbons are assumed to be perfectly ballistic and infinitely long .",
    "this means that the left and right ends of the nanoribbons act as drains which absorb any particles exiting to the left of right . to simulate the effect of finite temperatures we used a simple energy averaging procedure in the calculation of the transmission curves : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the fermi function .",
    "the actual results shown in fig .  [ fig : focusing - main ] were calculated at @xmath152 temperature .",
    "as it can be expected , higher temperatures tend to smear the curves while at lower ones an additional fine structure appears .    for simple armchair and zigzag nanoribbons we assumed that the hopping parameter between the atoms is the same everywhere on the ribbons .",
    "in contrast , for the zz(57 ) edge we took into account that the hopping parameter changes on the pentagons and heptagons at the edges with respect to its the bulk value .    .",
    "[ fig : reczag - params ] ]    we calculated the hoppings with density - functional tight - binding ( dftb ) method , using the hotbit code.@xcite this approach yields the hopping matrix elements as two - center integrals for pseudo - atomic orbitals that result from a straightforward pathway of _ ab initio _ calculations , as described in ref .  .",
    "the density - functional parametrization yields a valid description of the covalent bonding in carbon nanomaterials.@xcite fig.[fig : reczag - params ] shows the relative hoppings from dftb - optimized geometry , note how the appearance of a triple bond in the armrest parts affects also the @xmath153-electron hopping , due to the significant reduction in bond length.@xcite    .",
    "[ fig : reczag - bands ] ]    in the one orbital per site approximation we employed here the band structures of zigzag and reczag nanoribbons , apart from the close vicinity of the dirac point , are very similar ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : reczag - bands ] ) .",
    "this explains why they have very similar focusing spectra as well .",
    "in summary , we studied coherent electron focusing in graphene nanoribbons using both exact quantum calculations and in semiclassical approximation .",
    "we found that in the case of armchair edges the transmission peaks are at integer multiples of @xmath129 whereas for zigzag edges such a simple rule holds only when the filling factor @xmath137 is much larger than unity . for zigzag nanoribbons in stronger magnetic field ,",
    "when the filling factor is of the order of one , a more complex interference pattern can be observed in the transmission and the emergence of this interference pattern can be understood from semiclassical calculations .",
    "the presence of focusing peaks at low magnetic fields can therefore attest to the quality of the edge structure , while measurements at stronger fields can discriminate between armchair and zigzag edges .",
    "our numerical calculations on zz(57 ) edges suggest that the above conclusion holds even if the zigzag edge is structurally reconstructed .",
    "although we considered in our analytical calculations nanoribbons whose both edges had perfect armchair or zigzag structure , we expect that our findings are more generally valid .",
    "namely , they rely on the properties of edges states localized at one of the edges therefore imperfections of the other edge should not affect the focusing peaks .",
    "therefore this technique should be applicable to study the edges of graphene flakes as well .",
    "finally , an interesting extension of our work would be to consider the focusing spectrum of other proposed@xcite edge types and possibly taking into account more than one orbital per site in the transport computations .                                    for the calculations shown in fig.[fig : focusing - main ] we considered graphene nanoribbons for which @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the width of the injector and collector probes were @xmath156 and we assumed that the electron density in the ribbon was @xmath157 .",
    "although the limitations of our numerics did not allow us to consider experimentally more realistic cases ( i.e. @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) we are confident that our main results are robust and can therefore have experimental relevance ."
