    "physics beyond the standard model may introduce non - standard interactions ( nsi )  @xcite suppressed by a higher energy scale .",
    "in general , such new physics is usually described by effective dimension six  @xcite and eight  @xcite operators .",
    "one can describe the effective dimension @xmath0 lagrangian as a function of the non - standard physics scale @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath4 is a dimension @xmath0 operator .",
    "thus , the non - standard physics will be suppressed by @xmath5 with respect to the weak interactions , where @xmath6 is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .    in this study , we focus on non - standard propagation effects in standard oscillations ( so ) .",
    "these can be phenomenologically described by neutral current - type nsi of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 , which affect the neutrino propagation in matter for @xmath9 .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath10 are complex numbers for @xmath11 , and real numbers for @xmath12 , where we define @xmath13 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are possible sources of non - standard cp violation ( nsi - cpv ) . or @xmath16 involve two mediator fields ( and some cancellation conditions ) , and propagation nsi are not related to source and detection nsi  @xcite . ]",
    "they enter the propagation hamiltonian in flavor base proportional to the matter potential @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 the electron density ) in the off - diagonal elements .",
    "since @xmath19 is very well constrained , we focus on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for which the current bounds are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively  @xcite . therefore , the phases @xmath24 and @xmath25 might be accessible by future experiments for large enough @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ". the necessary conditions for an underlying model producing such large nsi are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . since these interactions will be suppressed by at least a factor of @xmath26 ( _ cf .",
    "_ , eq .  ( [ equ : lageff ] ) ) , it might be plausible to look for nsi - cpv in the best discussed neutrino oscillation experiments which are sensitive to the highest @xmath1-scales , such as neutrino factories  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of nsis in neutrino factories has been discussed in refs .  @xcite . as illustrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the disappearance channels and second `` magic '' baseline  @xcite are mandatory for excellent nsi sensitivities . in particular , @xmath15 is best measured with the disappearance channel , whereas @xmath16 is best measured with the appearance channel .",
    "therefore , we expect that the measurement of @xmath25 will be qualitatively similar to that of @xmath27 , whereas that of @xmath24 will have completely new characteristics .",
    "we use in this study the baseline setup of the international design study for a neutrino factory  @xcite , which includes two baselines , as well as the disappearance channels by the measurement of the wrong - sign muons .",
    "a focus of this letter is to demonstrate that the discovery of nsi - cpv should be quantified with performance indicators similar to so - cpv .",
    "in addition , the full ( relevant ) parameter space using a full simulation is discussed . since there is no model - independent connection between source or detection and propagation nsi  @xcite and",
    "there is not yet any near detector specification for the neutrino factory within the international design study , we do not discuss source and propagation nsi .",
    "our simulations use the globes software  @xcite with the current best - fit values and solar oscillation parameter uncertainties from ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as a 2% error on the ( constant ) matter density profile , _",
    "i.e. _ , we expect the matter density profile to be known with that precision .",
    "measurement is very small , at the level of a few percent correction . ] for the sake of simplicity , we use a normal simulated mass hierarchy .",
    "the experimental scenario we consider is the ids - nf  1.0 setup from ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the current standard setup for the `` international design study of the neutrino factory '' ( ids - nf ) .",
    "this setup has been optimized within refs .",
    "@xcite for the measurement of @xmath28 , the neutrino mass hierarchy , and leptonic cp violation in the case of standard oscillations .",
    "in short , it uses two baselines at about @xmath29 and @xmath30 with two ( identical ) magnetized iron neutrino detectors ( mind ) with a fiducial mass of @xmath31 each . for each baseline ,",
    "a total of @xmath32 useful muon decays plus @xmath32 useful anti - muon decays in the straight of the corresponding storage ring is used , which could be achieved by ten years of operation with @xmath33 useful muon decays per baseline , year , and polarity .",
    "the muon energy @xmath34 is assumed to be @xmath35 , which is sufficient for a detector with a low enough detection threshold  @xcite .",
    "the detector and systematics specifications can be found in refs .",
    "note that there is not yet any near detector specification .",
    "we do not simulate the near detector explicitely , because we do not discuss non - standard production or detection effects such as in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a small modification of the ids - nf baseline setup",
    ", we do not include the emulsion cloud chamber for @xmath36 detection at the short baseline , since it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that it hardly contributes to the so and nsi sensitivities if two baselines are used .",
    "we have checked that this also applies for a ( hypothetical ) @xmath37 oscillation channel for the effects discussed in this study ( which might be different for nsis in the production process , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "sensitivity to nsi - cpv in @xmath16 as a function of the true values of @xmath21 and @xmath25 ( for the true @xmath38 ) .",
    "the different contours correspond to @xmath39 ( dashed ) , @xmath40 ( thin solid ) , and @xmath41 ( thick ) . ]    we define the sensitivity to nsi - cpv , in the same way as the sensitivity to so - cpv , as the @xmath42 with which any cp conserving solution can be excluded .",
    "that is , we simulate a true @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the cp violating phase @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , we have a set of simulated values for the so parameters",
    ". then we compute the @xmath42 for @xmath44 ( fit ) fixed to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( cp conservation ) and choose the minimum between these two values .",
    "all the fit so parameters and @xmath48 ( fit ) are marginalized over . for the sake of simplicity , we do not take into account the mass hierarchy degeneracy .",
    "in the context of nsi - cpv , the most important question might be for which region of the parameter space nsi - cpv will be discovered at a neutrino factory .",
    "since the solar and atmospheric oscillation parameters are very well known , the performance will mainly depend on the true values of @xmath49 , @xmath44 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath44 describes the cp violation of interest .",
    "because the absolute value of @xmath10 suppresses the phase measurement , the simulated @xmath50 and @xmath44 will be the most important parameters for the parameter space test , similar to @xmath28 and @xmath27 for the so - cpv .",
    "we illustrate this dependence in figure  [ fig : did ] for @xmath16 as a function of the true values of @xmath21 and @xmath25 , as well as the true @xmath38 .",
    "this figure looks very similar to the corresponding so - cpv figure as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath27 : there is a cutoff at small @xmath21 , below which the phase effects are suppressed , and there is no sensitivity close to the cp - conserving solutions @xmath51 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we adopt an approach similar to that of so - cpv .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : nscpv ] the fraction of @xmath24 ( left ) and @xmath25 ( right ) for which nsi - cpv will be discovered as a function of the @xmath20 ( left ) and @xmath21 ( right ) . in this case , the fraction of @xmath52 represents the stacking of all sensitive regions in figure  [ fig : did ] along any vertical line corresponding to any fixed @xmath21 . in figure",
    "[ fig : nscpv ] , the dependence on the true @xmath28 and @xmath27 is indicated by the shaded regions , whereas the curves correspond to the true @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , the thick curve in the right panel corresponds to the thick curve in figure  [ fig : did ] ) .    as it is obvious from the analytical and quantitative discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) appearance channels will dominate the determination of @xmath25 , whereas the @xmath55 ( and @xmath56 ) disappearance channels will dominate the the determination of @xmath24 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for more analytical discussions ) .",
    "for that reason , we obtain a strong dependence on the simulated @xmath28 and @xmath27 for @xmath25 ( right panel of figure  [ fig : nscpv ] ) , because the appearance channels are most sensitive to these so parameters , whereas the cp violation in @xmath24 is hardly affected by these parameters . from figure  [ fig : nscpv ] ( left panel ) , we can read off that nsi - cpv will be discovered for about 80% of all possible @xmath24 for @xmath57 close to the current bound .",
    "the @xmath20 reach is , however , limited to @xmath58 , which means that any significant improvement of the bound will exclude this possibility . for @xmath25 in the right panel",
    ", we obtain a picture qualitatively similar to the so - cpv measurement because of the dominance of the appearance channels .",
    "we obtain a large fraction of @xmath25 of up to 80% in an intermediate range @xmath59 . from the analytical discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ( eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) ) , we can not observe the nsi - cpv for too large @xmath21 , because the terms quadratic in @xmath21 will then be too large a background for @xmath60 .",
    "this means that although the nsi can be easily established , the nsi - cpv can not be established against the phase - independent terms .",
    "let us assume that there is no so - cpv in nature , but there is large nsi - cpv .",
    "what would such a fit look like , and when would one confuse the nsi - cpv with the so - cpv ?",
    "since @xmath24 is measured in the disappearance channel , which is hardly affected by @xmath27 , we focus on @xmath25 in this section .    as an example",
    ", we choose a true @xmath61 ( cp conservation ) and the true @xmath62 ( maximal cp violation ) , and we simulate three specific sets of true values :    a : :    @xmath63 ,    @xmath64 b : :    @xmath63 ,    @xmath65 c : :    @xmath66 ,    @xmath64    there is some parameter dependence in these choices , but the examples are good enough to illustrate the qualitative main points .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : wrongfit ] , left three columns , the fits in the @xmath28-@xmath27 ( upper row ) and @xmath21-@xmath25 ( lower row ) planes assuming the nsi scenario including @xmath16 . obviously , in all cases , the minimal @xmath67 because we simulate the average experiment performance without statistical fluctuations . at @xmath68 , nsi - cpv",
    "can neither be established in case  a nor in case  c , whereas it can be measured in case  b ( lower row ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath27 can be measured in cases  b , and  c , whereas no information can be obtained in case  a ( upper row ) .",
    "generally speaking , the true @xmath28 or true @xmath21 have to be large enough to observe the corresponding phase . in the right panel of figure  [ fig : wrongfit ] , we illustrate the effect of the wrong hypothesis : if only standard oscillations are assumed ( and @xmath69 in the fit ) , the minimal @xmath70 in all three cases will be non - vanishing , and might be confused with statistical fluctuations . in all three cases ,",
    "the simulated maximal nsi - cpv will be mis - interpreted as so - cpv , because the cp - conserving values @xmath61 and @xmath47 can be excluded .",
    "note that especially in cases  a and  c the minimal @xmath70 is relatively small , and the confusion might not be obvious .",
    "even worse , in these cases neither so - cpv nor nsi - cpv would be established in the correct fit .",
    "sensitivity to any ( so or nsi ) cpv as a function of the true @xmath28 and true @xmath21 .",
    "the sensitivity is given as a fraction of all ( true ) @xmath71 for which cpv can be established ( @xmath68 ) . ]",
    "let us suppose that there are nsi , and there might be cp violation from either @xmath27 or @xmath25 . in this case , it may be an interesting question if any cp violation can be established , no matter of the origin .",
    "this question is equivalent to excluding the cp conserving solutions @xmath72 .",
    "similar to the `` fraction of @xmath27 '' or `` fraction of @xmath25 '' for the single parameter measurement , we define , for a given set of true @xmath28 and @xmath21 , the fraction of ( true ) @xmath71 as the fraction of the @xmath71 plane for which ( any ) cp violation can be established .",
    "this means that for a random pick of @xmath27 and @xmath25 ( uniformly distributed in the phases ) , this parameter will tell the probability that cp violation can be established .",
    "we show this sensitivity to any ( so or nsi ) cpv as a function of the true @xmath28 and true @xmath21 in figure  [ fig : anycpv ] . obviously ,",
    "if both @xmath28 and @xmath21 are small , no cpv can be established .",
    "if only one of the parameters is small , the sensitivity corresponds to the single parameter measurement ( for the other parameter and its phase being marginalized over ) . if both @xmath28 and @xmath21 are large and in their optimal ranges , the fraction of @xmath71 can reach more than 95% . in this case",
    ", cpv can not be established in only very small regions around the four cp - conserving solutions given above . in the probability interpretation ,",
    "the chance to find cpv is therefore , in fact , larger if both large @xmath28 and @xmath21 are present , compared to the case of no nsi .",
    "we have demonstrated that , in a neutrino factory corresponding to the current ids - nf baseline setup , cp violation from non - standard neutrino interactions in matter could be measured if @xmath58 or @xmath73 .",
    "this observation is almost independent of the true values of @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "we have also shown that there are regions in parameter space where an erroneous assumption of standard oscillations only will lead to a fake cp violation signal in the presence of nsi , even if cp is conserved in @xmath27 .",
    "finally , we have discussed the chances to measure _ any _ cp violation in the presence of both large enough @xmath28 and @xmath21 . we have found that cp violation will be found in up to 95% of all possible phase combinations for @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "for the quantification , we have used performance indicators similar to the standard cp violation measurement .",
    "we conclude that even if there is no cp violation in standard oscillations or @xmath28 is too small to detect it , a neutrino factory has the chance to find cp violation from new physics effects . in any future analysis ,",
    "it is therefore important to carefully consider the possibility of non - standard effects , in order not to overlook an even more interesting hint for new physics .",
