    "from the dawn of evolutionary biology , two general mechanisms , darwinian and lamarckian , have been routinely considered as alternative models of evolutionary processes .",
    "the _ darwinian hypothesis _ posits that adaptive traits arise continuously over time through spontaneous mutation , and that evolution proceeds through natural selection on this already existing variation .",
    "in contrast , the _ lamarckian hypothesis _ proposes that adaptive mutations arise in response to environmental pressures .",
    "the nobel prize winning fluctuation test by salvador luria and max delbrck @xcite is credited with settling this debate , at least in the context of evolution of phage - resistant bacterial cells .",
    "luria and delbrck realized that the two hypotheses would lead to different variances ( even with the same means ) of the number of bacteria with any single adaptive mutation .",
    "specific to the case of bacteria exposed to a bacteriophage , this would result in different distributions of the number of surviving bacteria , cf .",
    "[ fig : tree ] . in the darwinian scenario ,",
    "there is a possibility of a phage - resistance mutation arising in generations prior to that subjected to the phage .",
    "if this mutation happens many generations earlier , there will be a large number of resistant progeny who will survive ( a `` jackpot '' event ) .",
    "however , there will be no survivors if the mutation does not exist in the population at the moment the phage is introduced .",
    "if the same experiment were repeated many times , the variance of the number of survivors would be large .",
    "in contrast , in the lamarckian scenario , the distribution of the number of survivors is poisson .",
    "indeed , each occurring mutation ( and hence each survivor ) happens with a small probability , independent of the others .",
    "this would result in the usual square - root scaling of the standard deviation of the number of survivors , a much smaller spread than in the darwinian case .    to test this experimentally ,",
    "luria and delbrck let the cells grow for a few generations , exposed them to a phage , plated the culture , and then counted the number of emergent colonies , each started by a single resistant , surviving bacterium .",
    "they found that the distribution of the number of survivors , as measured by the number of colonies grown after plating , was too heavy - tailed to be consistent with the poisson distribution .",
    "they concluded then that the bacteria must evolve using the darwinian mechanism .",
    "they could not derive an analytical form of the distribution of survivors in the darwinian model , so that their data analysis was semi - quantitative at best .",
    "in particular , they could only establish that the darwinian model fits the data better than the lamarckian / poissonian one , but they could not quantify _ how good _ the fit is .",
    "potentially even more importantly , the original paper contrasted only two scenarios : pure lamarckian and pure darwinian ones .",
    "however , it is possible that both processes have a role in bacterial evolution , as is abundantly clear now in the epoch of crispr and epigenetics @xcite . ruling out a significant lamarckian contribution to evolution would require us to show not only that the darwinian model explains the data better than the lamarckian one , but also that the darwininan model is more likely than the _ combination model _ , which allows for both types of evolutionary processes .",
    "evolution could also proceed through an entirely different mechanism , so that neither of the proposed models explain the data .",
    "distinguishing between these possibilities requires evaluating whether a specific model fits the data well , rather than which of the models fits the data better .    unlike luria and delbrck in 1943 , we have powerful computers and new statistical methods at our disposal",
    ". distributions that can not be derived analytically can be estimated numerically , and model comparisons can be done for models with different numbers of parameters . in this paper",
    ", we perform the quantitative analysis missing in the luria - delbrck paper and use their original data to evaluate and compare the performance of three models : darwinian ( d ) , lamarckian ( l ) , and combination ( c ) models .",
    "the comparison is somewhat complicated by the fact that both the l and d models are special cases of the c model , so that c is guaranteed to fit not worse than either l or d. we use bayesian model selection @xcite , which automatically penalizes for more complex models ( such as c ) to solve the problem .",
    "we conclude that , while the l model is certainly inconsistent with the data , d and c explain the data about equally well when this penalty for complexity is accounted for .",
    "thus the lamarckian contribution to evolution can not be ruled out by the 1943 luria and delbrck data .",
    "further , while d and c fit equally well , neither provide a quantitatively good fit to one of the two primary experimental data sets of luria and delbrck s paper , suggesting that the classic experiment may have been influenced by factors or processes not considered .",
    "there have been many theoretical attempts , with varying degrees of success , to find closed - form analytical expressions of the distribution of mutants under the darwinian scenario ( the luria - delbrck distribution ) following different modeling assumptions @xcite .",
    "for example , models with constant and synchronous division times @xcite , exponentially distributed division times @xcite , and with different growth rates for the wild - type and the mutant populations @xcite have been proposed to find the distribution of survivors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . here",
    "we follow haldane s modeling hypotheses @xcite and assume that ( i ) normal cells and mutants have the same fitness until the phage is introduced , ( ii ) all cells undergo synchronous divisions , ( iii ) no cell dies before the introduction of the phage , ( iv ) mutations occur only during divisions , with each daughter becoming a mutant independently ( d case ) , or only when the phage is introduced ( l case ) , and ( v ) there are no backwards mutations .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the d and the c models are able to produce very good fits to the experimental data ( see below ) , which suggests that relaxation of these assumptions and design of more biologically realistic models is unnecessary in the context of these experiments .",
    "for the subsequent analyses , let @xmath0 be the initial number of wild - type , phage - sensitive bacteria , and @xmath1 be the number of generations before the phage is introduced , so that the total number of bacteria after the final round of divisions is @xmath2 , and the total that have ever lived is @xmath3 .",
    "we use @xmath4 to denote the probability of an adaptive ( darwinian ) mutation during a division , and @xmath5 to denote the probability of an adaptive lamarckian mutation when the phage is introduced . with this , and discounting the probability of another mutation in the already resistant progeny , the mean number of adaptive darwinian mutations at generation @xmath1 is @xmath6 , and the mean number of adaptive lamarckian mutations is @xmath7 .",
    "the number of survivors in the l model is poisson - distributed with the parameter @xmath8 : @xmath9    for the d model , there are multiple ways to have a certain number of resistant bacteria , @xmath10 , in the population of size @xmath11 before introducing the phage .",
    "for instance , there are four ways to have 5 resistant bacteria ( i.  e. , @xmath12 ) : ( i ) one mutation occurs 2 generations before the phage introduction ( where the total living population is @xmath13 at that generation ) , resulting in 4 resistant progenies in the last generation , and one more mutation at the last generation , making a total of 5 resistant cells before the phage introduction .",
    "this is the most likely scenario with probability @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of cells that have ever lived in the entire experiment , so that @xmath16 is the total number that have ever lived without mutating .",
    "the @xmath17 factor indicates that a total of two mutations have occurred in the population .",
    "the first choose factor denotes the number of independent mutational opportunities 2 generations before the phage introduction , and the second one denotes the number of mutational opportunities in the last generation .",
    "( ii ) two mutations occur 1 generation before the phage introduction and one more mutation in the last generation .",
    "this is less likely than ( i ) with probability @xmath18 , where , there are a total of 7 mutant that have ever lived in the history of the experiment and 3 mutational events before the introduction of the phage .",
    "( iii ) one mutation occurs 1 generation before the phage introduction and 3 more mutations in the last generation .",
    "this is less likely than ( ii ) with probability @xmath19 .",
    "( iv ) five mutations occur in the last generation before introducing the phage .",
    "this is the least likely scenario with probability @xmath20 . in general , for an arbitrary number of resistant cells , @xmath10 , let @xmath21 denote the set of sequences @xmath22 that satisfy @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 .",
    "this condition captures all the possible sequences of @xmath25 that produce @xmath10 number of resistant cells . for instance , in case ( i ) the corresponding sequence is @xmath26 , and in case ( ii ) it is @xmath27 .",
    "then , following haldane s approach @xcite , we can write @xmath28 , the probability of finding @xmath10 resistant cells given the darwinian model of evolution , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the probability @xmath31 is summed over all the possible sequences @xmath25 that produce the number @xmath10 ; in the case of @xmath32 mentioned earlier , @xmath33 .    for the combination model , both the l and the d processes contribute to generating survivors .",
    "thus we write the distribution of the number of survivors in this case as a convolution @xmath34    further analytical progress on the problem is hindered by additional complications . first , in actual experiments , the initial number of bacteria in the culture @xmath0 is random and unknown",
    ". we view it as poisson - distributed around the mean that one expects to have , denoted as @xmath35 .",
    "this gives : @xmath36 finally , in some of the luria - delbrck experiments , they plated only a fraction @xmath37 the entire culture subjected to the phage .",
    "this introduced additional randomness in counting the number of survivors after the plating , @xmath38 , which we again model as a poisson distribution with the mean @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xcite , resulting in the overall distribution of survivors : @xmath41      the expressions in the previous section appear sufficiently simple .",
    "however , evaluating @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp ] ) involves two nested sums in the expression for @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) , a convolution to combine l and d processes , and two more convolutions to account for randomness in @xmath0 and during plating .",
    "these series of nested ( infinite ) summations make it inefficient to use the analytical expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp ] ) for data analysis . instead , we resort to numerical simulations to evaluate @xmath43 ( expressions for the pure l model remain analytically tractable ) .",
    "our simulations assume that each culture begins with a poisson - distributed number of bacteria , with a mean number of 135 , as in the original paper .",
    "the bacteria were modeled as dividing in discrete generations for a total of @xmath44 generations .",
    "both of the numbers are easily inferable from the original paper using the known growth rate and the final cell density numbers .",
    "cells divide synchronously , and each of the daughters can gain a resistance mutation at division with the probability @xmath4 , which is nonzero in c and d models .",
    "daughters of resistant bacteria are themselves resistant .",
    "non - resistant cells in the final generation are subjected to a bacteriophage , which induces lamarckian mutations with probability @xmath5 , nonzero in c and l models .",
    "we note again that this total number of lamarckian - mutated cells is poisson - distributed with the mean @xmath5 times the number of the remaining wild type bacteria .    to speed up simulations of the darwinian process",
    ", we note that the total number of cells that have ever lived is @xmath45 .",
    "thus the total number of darwinian mutation attempts is poisson distributed , with mean @xmath46 .",
    "we generate the number of these mutations with a single poisson draw and then distribute them randomly over the multi - generational tree of cells , marking every offspring of a mutated cell as mutated .",
    "we then correct for overestimating the probability of mutations due to the fact that the number of mutation attempts in each generation decreases if there are already mutated cells there . for this",
    ", we remove original mutations ( and unmark their progenies ) at random with the probability equal to the ratio of mutated cells in the generation when the mutation appeared to the total number of cells in this generation .",
    "note that since mutations are rare , such unmarking is not very common in practice , making this approach substantially faster than simulating mutations one generation at a time .    to estimate @xmath47",
    ", we estimate this probability on a 41x41 grid of values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for each pair of values of these parameters",
    ", we perform @xmath48 simulation runs ( see below for the explanation of this choice ) starting with a poisson - distributed number of initial bacteria , then perform simulations as described above , and finally perform a simulated poisson plating of a fraction of the culture if the actual experiment we analyze had such plating .",
    "we measure the number of surviving bacterial cultures @xmath38 in each simulation run and estimate @xmath47 as a normalized frequency of occurrence of this @xmath38 across runs , @xmath49 .",
    "the darwinian case is evaluated as @xmath50 , and the lamarckian case as @xmath51 .      in the original luria and delbrck publication @xcite",
    ", no definitive quantitative tests were done to determine the quality of fit of either of the model to the data well .",
    "we can use the estimated values of @xmath47 for this task .",
    "namely , luria and delbrck have provided us not with frequencies of individual values of @xmath38 , but with frequencies of occurrence of @xmath38 within bins of @xmath52 . by summing @xmath53 over @xmath54 ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath55 , which allows us to write the probability that each experimental set of measurements , @xmath56 , came from the model : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the usual multinomial normalization coefficient .",
    "this probability can also be viewed as the likelihood of each parameter combination , and the peak of the probability gives the usual maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters @xcite . to guarantee that the estimated value of the likelihood has small statistical errors , we ensured that each of the @xmath59 combinations has 30,000,000 simulated cultures .",
    "then , at parameter combinations close to the maximum likelihood , each bin @xmath60 has at least 10,000 samples .",
    "correspondingly , at these parameter values , the sampling error in each bin is smaller than 1% .    finally , to evaluate the quality of fit of a model , rather than to find the maximum likelihood parameter values , we calculate empirically the values of @xmath61 for each parameter combination , where @xmath62 are synthetic data generated from the model with @xmath63",
    ". mean and variance of @xmath64 gives us the expected range of the likelihood if the model in question fits the data _",
    "perfectly_.      in comparing the l , the d , and the c models , we run into the problem that c is guaranteed to have at least as good of a fit as either d or l since it includes both of them as special cases .",
    "thus in order to compare the models quantitatively , we need to penalize c for the larger number of parameters ( two mutation rates ) compared to the two simpler models . to perform this comparison",
    ", we use bayesian model selection @xcite , which automatically penalizes for such model complexity .",
    "specifically , bayesian model selection involves calculation of probability of an entire model family @xmath65 rather than of its maximum likelihood parameter values : @xmath66 where the posterior distribution of @xmath67 is given by the bayes formula , @xmath68 and @xmath69 comes from eq .  (",
    "[ eq : likelihood ] ) . finally , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the _ a priori _ probabilities of the model and the parameter values within the model , which we specify below .    the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bms ] ) is over as many dimensions as there are parameters in a given model .",
    "thus while more complex models may fit the data better at the maximum likelihood parameter values , a smaller fraction of the volume of the parameter space would provide a good fit to the data , resulting in an overall penalty on the posterior probability of the model .",
    "thus posterior probabilities @xmath72 can be compared on equal footing for models with different number of parameters to say which specific model is _ a posteriori _ more likely given the observed data .",
    "often the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bms ] ) is hard to compute , requiring analytical or numerical approximations .",
    "however , here we already have evaluated the likelihood of combinations of @xmath73 over a large grid , so that the integral can be computed by direct summation of the integrand at different grid points .",
    "to finalize computation of posterior likelihoods , we must now define the _ a priori _",
    "distributions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we choose @xmath74 , indicating our ignorance about the actual process underlying biological evolution .",
    "the choice of @xmath71 is tricky , as is often the case in applications of bayesian statistics .",
    "we point out that the experiment was designed so that the number of surviving mutants is almost always 1 or less , for a population with @xmath75 individuals , which indicated that _ a priori _ both @xmath5 and @xmath4 are less than @xmath76 .",
    "further , we assume that , for the combined model , @xmath77 . beyond this",
    ", we do not choose one specific form of @xmath78 , but explore multiple possibilities to ensure that our conclusions are largely independent of the choice of the prior .",
    "luria and delbrck s paper provided data from multiple experiments , where in each experiment they grew a number of cultures , subjected them to the phage , and counted survivors . most of the experiments have @xmath79 cultures , which means that their statistical power for distinguishing different models is very low .",
    "we exclude these experiments from our analysis and focus only on experiments no .  22 and 23 , which have @xmath80 and @xmath81 cultures , respectively .",
    "the experimental protocols differ in that experiment 23 plated the entire culture subjected to the phage , while experiment 22 plated only 1/4 of the culture .",
    "we analyze these experiments separately from each other .",
    "we evaluated the posterior probability of different parameter combinations , @xmath82 , numerically , as described in _",
    "methods_. the likelihood ( posterior probability without the prior term ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihood22 ] .",
    "note that the peak of the likelihood is at @xmath83 , @xmath84 , illustrating that the data suggests that the combination model is better than either of the pure models in explaining the data , though the pure darwinian model comes close .",
    "the fit of the maximum likelihood combination model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bins22 ] .",
    "the quality of the best fit @xmath85 .",
    "this matches surprisingly well with the likelihood expected if the data was indeed generated by the model , @xmath86 .",
    "thus the model fits the data perfectly despite numerous simplifying assumptions , suggesting no need to explore more complex physiological scenarios , such as asynchronous divisions , or different growth rates for mutated and non - mutated bacteria .",
    "next we evaluate the posterior probabilities of all three models by performing the bayesian integral , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bms ] ) .",
    "we use two different priors for @xmath5 and @xmath4 to verify if our conclusions are prior - independent : uniform between 0 and @xmath76 and uniform in the logarithmic space between @xmath87 and @xmath76 . for the uniform prior , @xmath88 in other words ,",
    "the purely lamarckian model is ruled out by an enormous margin , as suggested in the original publication .",
    "however , the ratio of posterior probabilities of the darwinian and the combination models is only 2.8 , and this ratio is 2.0 for the logarithmic prior , which is way over the usual 5% significance threshold for ruling out a hypothesis . in other words ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the darwinian and the combination models of evolution have nearly the same posterior probabilities after controlling for different number of parameters in the models . thus contribution of lamarckian mechanisms to evolution in the luria - delbrck experiment 22 can not be ruled out . _",
