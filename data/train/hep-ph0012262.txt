    "the leading logarithmic contributions can be summed through all orders of perturbative qcd @xcite by applying a method originally proposed in @xcite for jet production in @xmath28 annihilation and the drell - yan process .    the spin - averaged cross section for sidis in a parity - conserving channel , _",

    "the angular basis functions are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 . of the four structure functions @xmath40 , only @xmath41 and @xmath42 contribute to the denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ the @xmath3-integrated cross section .",
    "of these two terms , @xmath41 is more singular and it dominates the rate . to explore the singular contributions in @xmath41",
    ", we introduce a scale @xmath27 related to the _ polar _ angle ( @xmath43 ) of the direction of the final hadron in the hcm frame .",
    "a convenient definition is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pseudorapidity of the charged hadron in the hcm frame ( defined with respect to the direction of the momentum @xmath11 of @xmath29 ) . in the limit @xmath46 ,",
    "the structure function @xmath41 is dominated by large logarithmic terms ; it has the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are some generalized functions . to obtain a stable theoretical prediction",
    ", these large terms must be resummed through all orders of perturbative qcd .",
    "the other structure functions @xmath49 are finite at this order ; we approximate them by fixed - order @xmath50 expressions .    in eq.([chgdasym ] ) , the numerator of @xmath51 or @xmath5 depends only on the structure function @xmath52 or @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the measurement of @xmath51 or @xmath5 must be combined with good knowledge of the @xmath3-integrated cross section , _",
    "i.e. , _ the denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) , to provide experimental information on the structure function @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "thus it is crucial to check whether the theory can reproduce the @xmath3-integrated cross section as a function of @xmath25 before comparing the prediction for ( [ chgdasym ] ) to the data .",
    "but , on the contrary , as shown in @xcite , the @xmath54 fixed - order cross section is significantly lower than the data from @xcite in the range of @xmath25 relevant to the zeus measurements",
    ". this difference signals the importance of higher - order corrections and undermines the validity of the @xmath55 result as a reliable approximation for the numerator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) .    on the other hand , the resummation calculation @xcite with a proper choice of the nonperturbative function yields a much better agreement with the experimental data for the @xmath3-integrated @xmath25-distribution from @xcite .",
    "one might try to improve the theoretical description of the zeus data using resummation for the denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) .",
    "however , the resummation calculation for @xmath56 in the phase space region relevant to the zeus data is currently not possible , largely because of the uncertainty in the parameterization of the nonperturbative contributions in this region .",
    "the resummed structure function @xmath57 includes a nonperturbative sudakov factor , which contains the effects of the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial - state parton and the nonperturbative fragmentation contributions to the transverse momentum of the final - state hadron . without first determining this nonperturbative factor , _",
    "e.g. , _ from other measurements , it is not possible to make a trustworthy theoretical prediction for the denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) and , hence , these azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetries measured by zeus may also be sensitive to uncertainties in the fragmentation to @xmath1 in the final state .",
    "indeed , the cross section in ( [ chgdasym ] ) includes convolutions of hard scattering cross sections with fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , integrated over the range @xmath58 .",
    "although the knowledge of ffs is steadily improving @xcite , there is still some uncertainty about their @xmath59-dependence and flavor structure for the range of @xmath60 relevant to the zeus measurement .",
    "therefore the most reliable tests of the theory would use observables that are not sensitive to the final - state fragmentation .",
    "the asymmetries @xmath61 would be insensitive to ffs if the dependence on the partonic variable @xmath62 were similar in the hard parts of the numerator and denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) , so that the dependence on the ffs would approximately cancel .",
    "( we denote the parton - level quantities by `` @xmath63 '' . )",
    "it is shown in appendix  b of @xcite that the partonic structure function @xmath64 , which dominates the denominator of ( [ chgdasym ] ) , contains terms proportional to @xmath65 that increase rapidly as @xmath66 decreases . however , the most singular terms in the partonic structure functions @xmath67 are proportional to @xmath68 .",

    "the theoretical curve is calculated for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , using the cteq5m1 parton distribution functions @xcite and fragmentation functions by s.  kretzer from @xcite.,height=283 ]    a curious fact appears to support the suggestion that the theoretical predictions for @xmath61 depend significantly on the fragmentation functions . while each of the measured asymmetries , @xmath4 and @xmath75 , deviates from the @xmath54 prediction , the data actually agree well with the @xmath54 prediction for the ratio @xmath76 , as shown in fig.[cosphi2cos2phi ] .",
    "the error bars are the statistical errors on @xmath23 and @xmath5 combined in quadrature ; this , however , may overestimate the statistical uncertainty if the two errors are correlated .",
    "since this ratio depends only on the numerators in eq.([chgdasym ] ) , which are less singular with respect to @xmath66 than the denominator , the dependence on the fragmentation functions may be nearly canceled in the ratio . the good agreement between the @xmath54 prediction and the experimental data for this ratio supports our conjecture that the fragmentation dynamics has a significant impact on the individual asymmetries defined in ( [ chgdasym ] ) .",
    "our final remark about the azimuthal asymmetries in ( [ chgdasym ] ) is that the @xmath25 ( or @xmath6 ) distributions are not the best observables to separate the perturbative and nonperturbative effects .",
    "the region where multiple parton radiation effects are important is specified by the condition @xmath77 .",
    "but the @xmath25 distributions are smeared with respect to the @xmath27 distributions by an additional factor of @xmath59 , because @xmath78 .",
    "thus the whole observable range of @xmath25 is sensitive to the resummation effects in the region of @xmath27 of the order of several gev .",
    "a better way to compare the data to the perturbative qcd prediction is to express the azimuthal asymmetries as a function of @xmath27 , not @xmath25 .",
    "then the comparison should be made in the region where the multiple parton radiation is unimportant , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath79 .",
    "next , we describe an alternative test of perturbative qcd , which will further reduce the above theoretical uncertainties : measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of the _ transverse energy flow_. in the hcm frame , the transverse energy flow can be written as @xcite@xmath80    unlike the charged particle multiplicity , the energy flow does not depend on the final - state fragmentation .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that a resummation calculation can provide a good description for the experimental data on the @xmath3-integrated @xmath81-flow .",
    "a new class of azimuthal asymmetries may be defined as @xmath82 the structure functions @xmath83 for the @xmath81-flow can be derived from the structure functions @xmath40 for the sidis cross section @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of the particle multiplicities , the asymmetries @xmath84 and @xmath85 receive contributions from @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "but , unlike the previous case , the denominator in ( [ etasym ] ) is approximated well by the resummed @xmath81-flow .",
    "thus these asymmetries can be calculated with greater confidence .",
    "energy flow asymmetries @xmath88 and @xmath89 for ( a ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 and ( b ) @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the figure shows predictions from the resummed ( solid ) and the @xmath69 ( dashed ) calculations.,width=642 ]    figure [ etasymqt ] shows our prediction for the azimuthal asymmetries @xmath84 and @xmath85 as functions of @xmath27 for ( a ) @xmath94 , @xmath95 in the left plots and ( b ) @xmath96 , @xmath97 in the right plots .",
    "the asymmetries are shown in @xmath27-bins that are obtained from the experimental pseudorapidity bins for the @xmath3-integrated @xmath81-flow data from ref .",
    "the upper @xmath98-axis shows values of the hcm pseudorapidity @xmath45 that correspond to the values of @xmath27 on the lower @xmath98-axis . for each of the distributions in fig.[etasymqt ] , the structure functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 were calculated at leading order in qcd , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath54",
    ". the solid and dashed curves , which correspond to the resummed and @xmath54 results respectively , differ because the structure function @xmath99 in the denominator of ( [ etasym ] ) differs for the two calculations .",
    "the resummed @xmath3-integrated @xmath81-flow is closer to the data than the fixed - order result , so that the predictions made by perturbative qcd for the subleading structure functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 will be confirmed if the experimental azimuthal asymmetries agree with the resummed distributions .",
    "a recent study @xcite shows that in the region @xmath100 the resummed @xmath3-integrated @xmath81-flow is larger than the @xmath54 prediction .",
    "this explains why the asymmetries for @xmath100 are smaller for the resummed denominator than for the @xmath54 denominator . in the region @xmath101 ,",
    "the asymmetries are determined by the asymptotic behavior of the fixed - order and resummed _ partonic _ structure functions @xmath102 . as @xmath46 , the @xmath54 structure functions @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath104 , and @xmath105 behave as @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "thus , asymptotically , the ratios @xmath109 go to zero , although the @xmath27 distribution for the asymmetry @xmath84 is quite large and negative for small , but non - vanishing @xmath27 ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[etasymqt ] ) .",
    "resummation of @xmath110 changes the @xmath27-dependence of the denominator , which becomes nonsingular in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , the asymmetry @xmath84 with the resummed denominator asymptotically grows as @xmath107 ( _ i.e. , _ in accordance with the asymptotic behavior of @xmath104 ) .",
    "hence neither the fixed - order nor the resummed calculation for @xmath84 is reliable in the low-@xmath27 region , so that higher - order or additional nonperturbative contributions must be important at @xmath46 .",
    "the asymptotic limit for the resummed @xmath85 remains finite , with the magnitude shown in fig.[etasymqt ] .",
    "since the magnitude of @xmath85 is predicted not to exceed a few percent , an experimental observation of a large asymmetry @xmath85 at small @xmath27 would signal the presence of some new hadronic dynamics , _",
    "e.g. , _ contributions from @xmath111-odd structure functions discussed in @xcite .",
    "figure [ etasymqt ] shows that the predicted asymmetry @xmath112 at @xmath113 is about 12% for the resummed denominator , while it is about 24% for the @xmath54 denominator .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath114 at @xmath113 is about 1.5 - 2% or 3.5 - 5% , respectively .",
    "both asymmetries are positive for @xmath100 .",
    "according to fig.[etasymqt]a , the size of the experimental @xmath27 bins ( converted from the @xmath45 bins in @xcite ) for low or intermediate values of @xmath115 is small enough to reveal the low-@xmath27 behavior of @xmath116 with acceptable accuracy .",
    "however , for the high-@xmath115 events in fig.[etasymqt]b , the experimental resolution in @xmath27 may be insufficient for detailed studies in the low-@xmath27 region .",
    "nonetheless , it will still be interesting to compare the experimental data to the predictions of perturbative qcd in the region @xmath117 , and to learn about the angular asymmetries at large values of @xmath115 and @xmath98 .    to conclude",
    ", we suggest that the azimuthal asymmetry of the energy flow should be measured as a function of the scale @xmath27 .",
    "these measurements would test the predictions of the perturbative qcd theory more reliably than the measurements of the asymmetries of the charged particle multiplicity .",
