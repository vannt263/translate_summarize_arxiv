    "band - ferromagnetism is bound to the existence of permanent magnetic moments belonging to itinerant electrons in a partially filled conduction band @xcite .",
    "archetypical representatives are the classical @xmath1 ferromagnets fe , co , ni . the microscopic interpretation of band - ferromagnetism is one of the most fundamental and also most complicated many - particle problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is expected to be due to the interplay between ordinary , spin - independent coulomb interaction ( strong and strongly screened ) and kinetic energy in the frame determined by the pauli principle .    a minimal model for the investigation of band - ferromagnetism",
    "was proposed independently by hubbard@xcite , kanamori@xcite and gutzwiller@xcite . despite its simple appearance , the hubbard model hamiltonian forms a highly non - trivial many body problem that can not be treated rigorously for the general case .",
    "a big step forward in the understanding of correlation effects in the hubbard model was the invention of the _ dynamical mean field theory _ ( dmft ) , which becomes an exact theory in the limit of infinite lattice dimensions @xcite .",
    "the dmft maps the lattice problem onto an effective single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) which can be solved numerically essentially exactly by use of e.g. quantum monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "one shortcoming of the otherwise highly successful dmft is the locality ( wave - vector independence ) of the electronic self - energy strictly valid only for @xmath2 .",
    "so it may be questionable , e.g. , whether such a self - energy is sufficient to describe angle - resolved photoemission results .",
    "recent efforts have therefore been focussed on regaining a certain degree of non - locality in the dmft self - energy @xcite .",
    "there are other approaches to the non - locality of the self - energy at low dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "coming from the weak coupling limit , schweitzer and czycholl proposed a method for solving the highly involved wave vector summations that appear already in second order diagrammatic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "kakehashi and fulde used a projection operator method combined with the coherent potential approximation for an investigation of the non - local excitation spectra @xcite .",
    "concerning ferromagnetism the few exactly known results for the hubbard model are of great value and can be used as a test frame for approximate theories .",
    "the nagaoka theorem @xcite states , that a saturated ferromagnetic order is the ground state for @xmath4 when one hole / electron is introduced into the half filled band for the simple cubic ( sc ) lattice in three dimensions ( 3d ) . the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite rules out ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic order in the hubbard model in dimensions @xmath5 for finite temperatures [ ] . for the infinite dimensional sc and fcc lattice",
    "the existence of ferromagnetism was proved by dmft calculations [ ] .",
    "apart from these rigorous results several works have investigated the possibility of ferromagnetism in the hubbard model within an approximation .",
    "dmft calculations where done for the 3d sc and fcc lattice [ ] and the influence of next - nearest - neighbour hopping was investigated in [ ] .",
    "ferromagnetism in various lattices was investigated with a spectral density approach ( sda ) self - energy in [ ] .",
    "variational methods have been used in [ ] .",
    "a general trend can be read from these calculations . two main ingredients favor ferromagnetism in the hubbard model .",
    "an asymmetric density of states ( dos ) ( e.g. the fcc dos ) and non - bipartite lattices with frustration in the anti - ferromagnetic correlations , which can be generated by introducing next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath6 .",
    "this shows the competitive character of ferro- and anti - ferromagnetic correlations in the hubbard model .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the influence of non - local correlations on ferromagnetic order in the sc lattice . to this end",
    "we shall apply the _ modified perturbation theory _",
    "( mpt ) , which was originally used only for solving the siam within the dmft procedure , directly to the full hubbard problem .",
    "the mpt leads to an explicitly wave - vector dependent self - energy which decisively determines the single - electron spectral density .",
    "it is well known that the latter provides the bare line shape of a spin and angle - resolved ( direct or inverse ) photoemission experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we introduce the hubbard model hamiltonian , derive the mpt self - energy and discuss its properties",
    ". then thermodynamic quantities as the paramagnetic static susceptibility and the optical conductivity are derived .",
    "+ in section [ sec : compmeth ] the numerical methods for dealing with the complicated momentum summations are presented .",
    "+ section [ sec : results ] contains the results and interpretation of our numerical calculations .",
    "finally we give a summary and conclusion in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is given by : @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the nearest neighbor hopping strength ( the sum over @xmath9 extends only over the nearest neighbors of @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the local coulomb repulsion and @xmath12 an homogeneous external magnetic field ( @xmath13 ) . we have chosen the band center of gravity @xmath14 and the hopping strength @xmath8 such that the free electronic bandwidth @xmath15 is equal to one throughout the paper .",
    "an ( approximate ) solution of the hubbard model is found , if we are able to calculate the electronic green s function ( gf ) : @xmath16 or more precisely the electronic self - energy @xmath17 .",
    "it is now a well - known fact , that the self - energy of the hubbard model becomes a purely local quantity in the limit of infinite dimensions ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath0-dependence will certainly play a crucial role in the more realistic case of @xmath3 . in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath19 ) the second order perturbation theory ( sopt ) is a good starting point for the investigation of non local correlation effects .",
    "the sopt self - energy is given by @xcite :    @xmath20    the sum extends over all lattice sites @xmath21 .",
    "schweitzer and czycholl @xcite gave a method for the calculation of ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) by collecting all symmetry equivalent points in shells and recast the sum over lattice sites into a sum over shells .",
    "they showed , that this sum can be truncated after a finite number of shells .",
    "however , their method of calculating the real and imaginary part of ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) is still numerically very demanding",
    ". we will show in section [ sec : compmeth ] how to speed up the computation to allow fully self consistent calculations for arbitrary band fillings @xmath22 .",
    "there is a certain arbitrariness in ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) concerning the spectral densities ( sd ) appearing in the formula . in an expansion strictly to order @xmath23 the free sd has to be chosen . as we are doing in this work . ] but one could also renormalize the theory by using the full sd in a self - consistent manner .",
    "it turns out , that only the first choice will reproduce certain exact results @xcite . to be specific we give the form of the sd used : @xmath24 @xmath25 is fixed by the condition , that the free occupation number is equal to the full occupation : @xmath26 .",
    "notice , that this choice of @xmath25 is equivalent to a sopt `` around hartree - fock ( hf ) '' at half filling where the full @xmath27 from ( [ eq : elect_green ] ) is taken in the hf - sd .",
    "only this choice will result in the now widely accepted three peak structure of the density of states ( dos ) and will give a `` smooth '' change of the dos away from half filling . for more qualitative discussions we refer the reader to the results section .",
    "+ to extend the validity of the self - energy to larger values of @xmath11 we use the following ansatz for a modified perturbation theory ( mpt ) : @xmath28 this form for the self - energy was proposed by kajueter and kotliar@xcite for the anderson impurity model ( siam ) .",
    "they used the first two spectral moments and an additional condition for the chemical potential to fix the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this method of fixing the parameters was afterwards modified by potthoff , wegner and nolting @xcite for the same model in order to reproduce the first four moments of the sd correctly .",
    "we will follow this latter approach but now applied to the full lattice hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . + to fix the appearing constants in ( [ eq : ansatz_mpt ] )",
    "we use the high energy expansion of the self - energy for the hubbard model : @xmath31 the first three coefficients can be obtained from the first four moments @xmath32 of the sd@xcite via the high energy expansion of the electronic gf ( [ eq : elect_green ] ) : @xmath33 and are given in the appendix ( [ eq : coeff_self1 ] ) . by expanding also the rhs of ( [ eq : ansatz_mpt ] ) we can determine the coefficients @xmath34 and get finally the mpt self - energy : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the third moment of ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) as given in the appendix ( [ eq : coeff_self2 ] ) . + the mpt self - energy can be proved to be exact in a variety of limiting cases .",
    "it trivially fulfills the limits of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "more interesting is case of zero bandwidth limit @xmath39 . a straightforward calculation yields : @xmath40 which is indeed the correct form of the `` atomic limit '' @xcite .",
    "expanding the self - energy for small @xmath11 reproduces the result of perturbation theory ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) with corrections only of order @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the mpt should be correct for small u and show e.g. fermi liquid behavior @xcite .",
    "+ since the first four spectral moments are reproduced correctly by construction , they should be correct at large energies @xmath42 , too .",
    "in particular the position and shape of the upper ( lower ) hubbard band for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) will become exact in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath45 ) which is known to be a weak point of sopt alone . in this respect the mpt self - energy is in accordance to the @xmath46 strong coupling expansion of harris and lange @xcite . to conclude this discussion we summarize our findings",
    "we have proposed a fully @xmath0-dependent mpt self - energy which fulfills the atomic limit and shows reasonable behavior in the weak and strong coupling region .",
    "therefore there is well - founded hope that our theory will give reasonable results also in intermediate coupling region .",
    "the developed theory allows for a self - consistent calculation of the magnetization in a possible appearing ferromagnetic region . to test the system regarding a ferromagnetic phase transition",
    ", we will calculate the paramagnetic static susceptibility , which is defined as follows : @xmath47 the zero crossings of the inverse of ( [ eq : para_susz ] ) indicate the points where the paramagnetic phase become susceptible to a ferromagnetic phase transition .    for an evaluation of ( [ eq : para_susz ] ) one",
    "has to perform the derivative analytically and get after a lengthy calculation an explicit form for the susceptibility as a functional of the ( self - consistently determined ) paramagnetic self - energy .",
    "since the expressions are rather long , we do not give them here .      the optical conductivity in linear response",
    "is given by the retarded current - polarization gf @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denote the cartesian coordinates of the operators . by writing down the eqm of this gf and exploiting the connection @xmath50_{-}$ ] this",
    "can be rewritten as : @xmath51_{- } \\rangle}}}{e }      + in\\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\langle\\!\\langle \\hat{j}^{\\beta};\\hat{j}^{\\alpha}\\rangle\\!\\rangle}}}{e}. \\label{eq : cond_2}\\ ] ] for a tight binding ( nearest neighbor hopping ) model the operators are given as @xmath52 and @xmath53 . with these operators the first term of ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) can be calculated and in case of a simple cubic lattice simplified to give the zero frequency drude weight of conductivity : @xmath54 the second term in ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) is the current - current gf .",
    "it represents the influence of electronic correlations .",
    "we approximate this gf on the one loop level in a diagrammatic expansion .",
    "the explicit calculation is given in appendix ( [ sec : optcondderiv ] ) and it is shown that the real part consists of two parts .",
    "one is proportional to @xmath55 and cancels the drude peak in case of a local self - energy exactly .",
    "the second term yields : @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "note , that this approximation becomes a rigorous result in infinite dimensions because the self - energy is a local quantity and all higher vertex corrections vanish in this case @xcite .",
    "we will only show results for the contribution from ( [ eq : jj_cond ] ) hoping that the exact cancellation is retained in the @xmath0-dependent case approximately at least .",
    "the neglect of vertex corrections can not be justified rigorously in case of a @xmath0-dependent self - energy , because ward identities may be violated .",
    "we show therefore only results for the 3d sc lattice , where the @xmath0-dependence of the self - energy is not so pronounced ( especially at the fermi level ) and refer the reader to the more specialized literature for a thorough discussion of this point @xcite .",
    "the self - energy ( [ eq : self_mpt ] ) is a functional of the chemical potential and different correlation functions .",
    "it has to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "to this end we need a fast way of calculating integrals of the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fermi function , @xmath60 a polynomial of low order in @xmath61 and @xmath62 the full sd .",
    "it is hopeless to perform the four dimensional integral directly because the sd is a strongly peaked function .",
    "however one can replace the energy integration by a sum over the poles of @xmath59 in the upper complex plane .",
    "the usual matsubara form of the laurent expansion of @xmath59 is not suitable here , because it converges very slowly with an increasing number of poles .",
    "recently ozaki [ ] proposed a different pole expansion for the fermi function which gives a good approximation for a large energy domain down to very low temperatures with only a few hundred poles .",
    "we use this expansion for a numerical very accurate determination of the energy integral . the remaining @xmath0 integration over the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone",
    "can then be performed directly .",
    "+ for the exposed procedure we need the values of the sopt self - energy at the ozaki poles in the complex plane . for their determination we first rewrite ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) as a sum over shells of symmetry equivalent points : @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the @xmath0 dependent shellfactor given by the sum over the exponentials in ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) within one shell and @xmath65",
    "the remaining energy dependent part .",
    "the imaginary part of the latter is given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the product of fermi functions in ( [ eq : sopt_self ] ) .",
    "this twofold convolution can be solved very efficiently by a fast fourier transform . from this @xmath65",
    "can be obtained in the complex plane via the spectral representation of greens functions @xcite . the free shell density of states needed for the calculation we have computed and stored beforehand to very high precision .",
    "the number of shells necessary to get converged results depends strongly on the coordination number of the underlying lattice .",
    "after some tests we have used 201 shells for the 2d and 61 shells for the 3d lattice for all calculations in this work , which was sufficient to get mostly converged self - energies .",
    "our @xmath0-dependent self - energy allows the description of homogeneous phases ( paramagnetic / ferromagnetic ) . we will discuss the electronic properties in the paramagnetic state of the three dimensional hubbard model first , knowing well that in certain parameter regimes ( e.g. near half filling at low temperatures ) anti - ferromagnetism is expected in principle",
    "this restriction is shared with other self - energy approaches ( e.g. dmft calculations ) and a comparison to these should render our results useful .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdos ] we show the quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) at low temperature ( @xmath68 ) for two different band fillings and various interaction parameters @xmath11 .",

    "upper and lower hubbard band are roughly separated by the coulomb interaction strength @xmath11 and there appears a kondo resonance near the fermi level ( @xmath72 ev in figures ) . by increasing @xmath11 ,",
    "this resonance decreases but stays finite also for large @xmath11 . as a consequence",
    "there is no clear metal - insulator transition ( mit ) for @xmath73 as is found in dmft calculations . to illustrate this further we show the inverse effective mass : @xmath74 in fig .",

    "this finding is in qualitative agreement with the non - local theory of kakehashi and fulde @xcite .",
    "+ the comparison of the local approximation ( only zeroth shell of the soc is taken into account ) and the full @xmath0-dependent calculation shows decisive effects of the latter . whereas the local theory fulfills the luttinger theorem ( the qdos at the fermi level is equal to the free dos ) , the @xmath0-dependence leads to a reduction of states at this point .",
    "this is understandable because the luttinger - ward argument only holds for local self - energies @xcite .",

    "this is clearly visible in the spectral density where in the lower / upper hubbard band `` bridges '' of sharply peaked states appear at both @xmath0 points .",
    "similar effects where found in sopt calculations by schweitzer and czycholl@xcite and in the projection operator method of kakehashi and fulde@xcite but here they are much more pronounced .",

    "it is interesting to note , that the ( local ) mpt , when used as an impurity solver in a dmft calculation for the infinite dimensional hubbard model does show a mit in the correct @xmath69 region , whereas it does not when used as a self - energy for the lattice hamiltonian@xcite . +",
    "another shortcoming of the current state of the theory is the inability to check for antiferromagnetic phases , which ultimately should appear near half - filling .",
    "the reason for this is in the ansatz of the self - energy ( [ eq : self_mpt ] ) , which only allows the calculation of homogeneous phases .",
    "this does not mean , that there are no possible antiferromagnetic solutions within the mpt approach .",
    "it would be an interesting task for a forthcoming work , to extend the mpt in this direction .",
    "an indirect hint for the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations within the mpt can be derived from the breakdown of ferromagnetic order near half filling , which could have its origin in competing antiferromagnetic correlations .",
