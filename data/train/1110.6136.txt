    "planetary orbits in binary systems provide useful clues to learn planetary migration mechanisms in binary systems .",
    "planets in binary systems have a chance to take a different path of orbital migration than planets in single star systems .",
    "that is , due to the presence of a binary companion , an inner planet can evolve into a highly eccentric and highly tilted , or even retrograde orbit , by the mechanism known as the kozai migration @xcite .",
    "observable evidences of the kozai migration are large eccentricity and large spin - orbit misalignment of an inner planet .",
    "one can measure the orbital eccentricity via radial velocity ( rv ) measurements , and one can also learn the spin - orbit alignment angle at least in sky - projection via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite , @xcite ; hirano  et  al .",
    "2011a ) in transiting systems",
    ".    one interesting example of a transiting planet in a wide binary system is hd  80606b , which has a large eccentricity ( @xmath7 , ) and a large sky - projected spin - orbit alignment angle ( @xmath8 , ) .",
    "the orbit of hd  80606b has been well explained by a scenario of the kozai migration due to the presence of the binary companion hd  80607 @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is wasp-8b , which has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with a wide binary companion , although a kozai migration scenario for wasp-8b has not been well examined .",
    "other transiting planets in binary systems , however , show neither large eccentricity nor large spin - orbit misalignment ( e.g. , hd189733b : @xcite ,",
    "tres-4b : @xcite ) .",
    "this fact can be understood by considering that the kozai migration needs to meet some stringent conditions ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . to learn the occurrence frequency of the kozai migration for planets in binary systems ,",
    "it is important to increase the number of observations for such transiting systems .",
    "we here report on the orbit of the transiting planet xo-2b , which was discovered by @xcite in the course of the xo survey .",
    "the host star xo-2 is a relatively faint ( @xmath9 ) k0v star ( the stellar mass @xmath10 and the stellar radius @xmath11 ) at @xmath12150 pc from the sun @xcite .",
    "xo-2 has the twin ( the same spectral type ) stellar companion xo-2s at 31  ( @xmath124600au ) separation .",
    "we note that the kozai migration for xo-2b could occur if the eccentricity of the binary orbit ( currently unknown ) is very large ( @xmath13 ) , when the timescale of the kozai migration is shorter than the timescale of a perturbation due to general relativity for xo-2b @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the mass , radius , orbital period of xo-2b as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 days , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity of xo-2b was assumed to be zero in the discovery paper , and no measurement of the rm effect in this system has been reported . in this letter",
    ", we present rvs of xo-2 spanning about two years and covering two full transits of xo-2b allowing us to model the rm effect .",
    "our rv data suggest a small eccentricity and a likely spin - orbit alignment of xo-2b , concluding no supporting evidence of the kozai migration .",
    "in addition , we find a long - term rv trend for xo-2 .",
    "this rv acceleration may suggest a third body in this system .",
    "the rest of this letter is organized as follows .",
    "we present details of our observations and reductions of rv data in section  2 .",
    "we describe our model to fit the observed data in section  3 .",
    "we present our results on the orbit of xo-2 and discussions on possible migration mechanisms of xo-2b in section  4 . finally , we summarize the findings of this letter in section  5 .",
    "we observed xo-2 with the standard i2a setup of the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds : @xcite ) onboard the subaru 8.2 m telescope on mauna kea .",
    "an iodine gas absorption cell was inserted for rv measurements .",
    "we measured rvs around two full transits of xo-2b on ut 2008 march 9 and ut 2009",
    "november 24 .",
    "we also gathered out - of - transit rvs spanning about two years from 2008 to 2010 .",
    "slit width was either @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) or @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) depending on observing conditions .",
    "exposure times were 600 s for around - transit phase and 900 s for out - of - transit phase .",
    "finally , we obtained a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr over 200 ) and high spectral resolution ( @xmath18 ) template spectrum on ut 2011 february 15 with an exposure time of 1800 s.    we process the observed frames with standard iraf procedures and extract 1d spectra .",
    "relative rvs and uncertainties are computed by the algorithm of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of each rv based on the scatter of rv solutions for @xmath124    segments of each spectrum as described in @xcite .",
    "the rvs and internal errors are summarized in table  1 , and plotted in the top panel of figure  1 .",
    "note that we use hjd@xmath21 ( heliocentric julian date in the coordinated universal time ) as a time standard .",
    "since we do not have good photometric transit data , we additionally incorporate five published photometric light curves taken with keplercam on the 1.2 m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) on mount hopkins , arizona @xcite .",
    "those transits were observed in the sloan z band . following the procedure by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we rescale the photometric uncertainties to account for time - correlated noise ( so - called red noise : see e.g. , @xcite ) by calculating a red noise factor @xmath22 for various @xmath23 ( corresponding to 10 - 20 min ) , and multiply the photometric uncertainties of each dataset by the maximum value of @xmath24 .",
    "we note that we find slightly higher values of @xmath24 than @xcite , and thus our photometric uncertainties are conservative .",

    "the shape of the rm effect clearly suggests a prograde orbit of xo-2 .",

    "it is because the orbital inclination @xmath36 of xo-2b is near @xmath61 .",
    "figure  4 plots a @xmath62 contour map in ( @xmath3 , @xmath63 ) space .",
    "our best - fit value of @xmath63 based on the rm effect is 1.45  km  s@xmath26 , which is in good agreement with a value @xmath64  km  s@xmath26 derived by @xcite based on a spectroscopic line analysis . @xcite",
    "independently estimated @xmath63 of xo-2 as @xmath65  km  s@xmath26 based on its mass and age , and concluded that the xo-2 system is likely to be aligned .",
    "the conclusion is apparently consistent with our result .",
    "thus although a larger value of @xmath63 is allowed by the rm effect , such a larger @xmath63 is unlikely when considering the other analyses . as a test case ,",
    "if we add a prior constraint @xmath64  km  s@xmath26 to the @xmath42 statistic , we find @xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "thus the orbit of xo-2b is unlikely to be highly tilted , but an exact value of @xmath3 is unfortunately indeterminate . as a result , we conclude a small eccentricity and a likely spin - orbit alignment for the orbit of xo-2b . as is known today ,",
    "rm measurements have shown that about two thirds of close - in giant planets are spin - orbit aligned and prograde , whereas the last third is strongly misaligned or even retrograde ( e.g. , ) .",
    "our result suggests that xo-2b is apparently in the first category .",
    "we determine the rv acceleration of xo-2 as @xmath68  m  s@xmath26  yr@xmath26 .",
    "the trend is small but significant in the two years . if we do not include @xmath34 as a free parameter , the @xmath42 value for the rvs changes from 48.8 to 231.9 . assuming a long - term linear trend , this rv acceleration can be explained by a hypotherical third body ( index `` c '' ) whose mass and orbit follow a relation @xmath69 @xmath6 @xmath70 .",
    "the orbital period of the third body can be longer than @xmath128yr ( @xmath71au ) since the rv trend is apparently linear spanning about 2 years .",
    "for example , a 1  @xmath6 planet at 5  au like the jupiter in our solar system meets the relation .",
    "we note that the binary companion xo-2s does not meet this relation .",
    "there is another possibility that the timescale of the additional rv variation is a few hundred days , due to the lack of our observations between the two transits .",
    "additional rv measurements with the subaru hds will allow us to discriminate the timescale of the rv variation .",
    "other possibilities of the trend include a systematic rv variation of the subaru hds , starspots or magnetic cycles of xo-2 .",
    "the first scenario is unlikely , because rvs of the subaru hds for rv standard stars are stable within a few m  s@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the starspot scenario is also unlikely , because no significant rv variation has been observed for xo-2 in a timescale corresponding to the rotation period of the host star ( @xmath1235 day : @xcite ) , although rv variations caused by spots should have been maximum . at this point",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility of magnetic cycles of xo-2 recently examined by @xcite , although any strong magnetic activity has not been reported for this system . to specify the cause of the rv variation and make a decisive conclusion ,",
    "further rv monitoring would be very important in this system .",
    "there is still a possibility that the mutual inclination between the orbital axes of the transiting planet xo-2b and the binary companion xo-2s was once larger than the threshold value of the kozai mechanism .",
    "in addition , if the eccentricity of the binary orbit is larger than @xmath120.9 , the timescale of the kozai migration might have been shorter than that of general relativity for xo-2b at the birthplace ( @xmath122gyr based on @xcite ) .",
    "however , the presence of the hypotherical third body completely dictates that xo-2b can not be migrated through the kozai migration caused by xo-2s , since the gravitational perturbation timescale due to the third body ( comparable to the orbital period of the third body ) is much shorter than the kozai migration timescale ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite pointed out that a hot jupiter around a cool ( less than @xmath126250k ) star can lead to a re - alignment of its spin - orbit alignement angle due to the tidal force on a convective surface layer of the cool host star .",
    "xo-2 is in the category of a cool star ( @xmath125340k : @xcite ) and the spin axis of the host star might have been re - aligned .",
    "thus one possible migration scenario is that xo-2b has migrated through planet - planet scattring ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and subsequently the eccentricity and the spin - orbit alignment angle have been damped . in that case , the hypothetical third body may be the counterpart of the planet - planet scattering .",
    "another possible migration mechanism is the standard disk - planet interaction mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not specify the migration mechanism of xo-2b at this point in time , further measurements of transit timings of xo-2b would be useful to constrain another low - mass body in mean motion resonance , which can be an evidence of the disk - planet migration ( @xcite ) .",
    "any detection or constraint of such a mean motion resonance body by transit timings , as well as further rv measurements , would allow further discussions on the migration history of this system .",
