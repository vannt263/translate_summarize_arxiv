    "<S> atmospheric water vapour is an essential ingredient of weather and climate . </S>",
    "<S> key features of its distribution can be represented by kinematic models which treat it as a passive scalar advected by a prescribed flow and reacting through condensation . </S>",
    "<S> condensation acts as a sink that maintains specific humidity below a prescribed , space - dependent saturation value . in order to investigate how the interplay between large - scale advection , small - scale turbulence and condensation controls the moisture distribution , </S>",
    "<S> we develop simple kinematic models which combine a single circulating flow with a brownian - motion representation of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we first study the drying mechanism of a water - vapour anomaly released inside a vortex at an initial time . </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider a cellular flow with a moisture source at a boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the statistically steady state attained shows features reminiscent of the hadley cell such as boundary layers , a region of intense precipitation and a relative humidity minimum . </S>",
    "<S> explicit results provide a detailed characterisation of these features in the limit of strong flow . </S>"
