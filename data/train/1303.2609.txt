    "in the current paradigm of galaxy formation within a merging hierarchy of dark - matter halos , galaxies form when gas is able to cool , condense , and form stars at the centers of dark - matter halos @xcite . galaxy formation thus involves complicated baryonic processes that play crucial roles on galaxy and cluster scales but are poorly understood in many aspects .",
    "one of the resulting effects is that the galaxy distribution is biased relative to the dark matter distribution and such biasing depends strongly on both spatial scale and galaxy properties ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of galaxy distribution are expected to provide powerful constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is common to use the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) , @xmath2 , to quantify the galaxy clustering in both theories and galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the 2pcf measures the excess probability of finding pairs in the universe .",
    "a gaussian - distributed density field can be fully described by the 2pcf , or its fourier - space counterpart , the power spectrum .",
    "however , non - gaussianity naturally arises in the nonlinear evolution of the density fluctuation through the mode - coupling of different scales ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to quantify the non - gaussianity and better understand the galaxy distribution",
    ", we would require the next - order statistics in the hierarchy of @xmath3-point correlation functions , the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , @xmath4 , which can be used to derive the nonlinear galaxy bias .",
    "a consequence of the additional information provided by the 3pcf is that we can break the degeneracy of galaxy bias and @xmath5 ( the rms of the matter density field in the @xmath6 sphere ) in the 2pcf , which also helps constrain the cosmological parameters @xcite .    for the study of the 3pcf , it is generally more convenient to introduce the reduced 3pcf , @xmath7 , defined as the ratio between the 3pcf and the sum of the products of the 2pcfs , @xmath8 such a hierarchical scaling ( @xmath9 ) was introduced by @xcite , assuming @xmath1 to be a constant .",
    "although subsequent theories and observations found that @xmath1 is generally dependent on the size and shape of the triangle ( @xmath10 ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still more natural to use @xmath1 as the measurement of non - gaussianity generated from gravitational clustering . in observation ,",
    "the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) effect will significantly change the shape and amplitude of both the 2pcf and the 3pcf , because the galaxy peculiar velocities prevent us from measuring the real radial distribution of the galaxies .",
    "the projected correlation function is then used to minimize the influence of the rsd .",
    "since the projected correlation function can be easily converted to the real - space correlation function @xcite , the projected 3pcf was proposed to represent the actual 3pcf in real space .",
    "@xcite first applied this statistic to the las campanas redshift survey .    in order to use the 3pcf to constrain the galaxy formation and evolution models , knowledge of",
    "the relation between galaxies and dark - matter halos is important .",
    "the clustering dependence of the 2pcf on galaxy properties is extensively investigated in the literature to infer how galaxies of different properties populate the dark - matter halos of different masses , which is commonly referred to as the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the 2pcf itself is not enough to break the degeneracy in the theoretical model parameters .",
    "the measurements of the clustering dependence on galaxy properties from the 3pcf will further help put a strong constraint on the allowed hod parameters @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the luminosity dependence of the reduced 3pcf , @xmath7 , in both redshift and projected spaces .",
    "they found a small but significant trend : more luminous galaxies have lower amplitudes of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also measured the redshift - space @xmath1 with 2dfgrs and found a weak tendency for @xmath1 to decrease with increasing luminosity in the nonlinear regime . @xcite and",
    "@xcite employed the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and found no significant dependence of @xmath1 on galaxy morphology , color , or luminosity .",
    "considering the large measurement errors , their results are statistically consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the dependence of @xmath1 on luminosity and color in redshift and projected spaces using sdss data release 6 .",
    "they found a similar luminosity and color dependence to previous work and inferred that the weak shape dependence of @xmath1 on small scales is caused by the rsd .",
    "apart from the analysis of the observational data , another way to study the effect of the rsd on the 3pcf is to use numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used @xmath3-body simulations to construct mock galaxy catalogs and compared @xmath1 in both real and redshift spaces .",
    "they found the same luminosity dependence of @xmath1 as in the observations and they argued that the color dependence of @xmath1 appears stronger than the luminosity dependence , which is consistent with the finding of @xcite .    in this paper , we will focus on measuring the dependence of the 3pcf on the galaxy stellar mass and the dependence on color in certain stellar mass bins .",
    "we use the final release data ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of sdss to measure the 3pcf in both redshift and projected spaces in the local universe . since the stellar mass dependence of the 3pcf has never been studied before , it will provide powerful constraints on the connection between galaxy stellar mass and their hosting dark matter halo mass , which will be explored in our future work .",
    "for consistency with previous work , we also briefly investigate the luminosity dependence of the 3pcf in our sample .",
    "we extend the previous analysis by exploring galaxy samples in a broader range of scales and triangle configurations , in order to clarify whether the weak shape dependence of @xmath1 is really caused by the rsd .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] , we briefly describe the galaxy and mock samples .",
    "the methods of measuring the 2pcf and 3pcf are presented in section  [ sec : methods ] .",

    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a cosmology model with a density parameter @xmath11 , a cosmological constant @xmath12 , and a hubble constant @xmath13kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the galaxy sample used in this paper is a magnitude - limited sample taken from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) , constructed by @xcite based on sdss dr7 .",
    "this sample has formed the basis for the recent studies on the galaxy distribution in the low - redshift universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sample contains about half a million galaxies located in the main contiguous area of the survey in the northern galactic cap , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and spectroscopically measured redshifts in the range of @xmath18 .",
    "here @xmath19 is the @xmath19-band petrosian apparent magnitude , corrected for galactic extinction , and @xmath20 is the @xmath19-band petrosian absolute magnitude , corrected for evolution and @xmath21-corrected to @xmath22 .",
    "the apparent magnitude limit is chosen to select a sample that is uniform and complete over the entire area of the survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the median redshift of this sample is @xmath23 , with @xmath24 of the galaxies below @xmath25 and @xmath24 above @xmath26 .",
    "the stellar mass of each galaxy in our sample accompanies the nyu - vagc release .",
    "it is estimated based on the redshift and the five - band petrosian magnitudes from the sdss photometric data , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "this estimate corrects implicitly for dust and assumes a universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite form .",
    "as demonstrated in appendix a of @xcite , once all estimates are adapted to assume the same imf , the estimated stellar masses agree quite well with those obtained from the simple , single - color estimator of @xcite and also with those derived by @xcite from a combination of sdss photometry and spectroscopy .    from this sample we select two sets of samples according to either @xmath19-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath20 ) or stellar mass ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in each of these samples , we further divide the galaxies into _ red _ and _ blue _ populations according to their @xmath28 colors , following the luminosity - dependent color cut determined in @xcite .",

    "for each real galaxy , we generate @xmath46 sky positions at random within the mask of the survey ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , and we assign to each of them the properties of the real galaxy in particular , its values of redshift , luminosity , and stellar mass as well as the position - dependent spectroscopic completeness .",
    "this method is valid only for wide - field surveys like sdss , where randomizing sky positions should be sufficient to break the coherence of the large - scale structures in the real sample .",
    "extensive tests show that random samples constructed in this way produce indistinguishable results from those using the traditional method , which relies on the galaxy luminosity function obtained from the same survey to determine the redshift - dependent average number density of galaxies required for generating the random points @xcite .",
    "we construct a set of 80 mock sdss galaxy catalogs from the millennium simulation @xcite using both the sky mask and the magnitude and redshift limits of our real sdss sample .",
    "the millennium simulation uses @xmath47 particles to follow the dark - matter distribution in a cubic region with 500@xmath48mpc on a side , assuming the concordance @xmath49 cold dark - matter cosmology .",
    "galaxy formation within the evolving dark - matter halos is simulated in postprocessing using semi - analytic methods tuned to give a good representation of the observed low - redshift galaxy population .",
    "our mock catalogs are based on the galaxy formation model of @xcite and are constructed from the publicly available data at @xmath50 using the methodology of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these mock catalogs allow us to derive reasonable error estimates for the correlation functions we measure , including both sampling and cosmic - variance uncertainties .",
    "we use all 80 mock catalogs for estimating the errors of our 2pcf measurements . for the 3pcfs ,",
    "we use only 10 of the 80 mock catalogs randomly selected from the whole set , in order to save computational time while obtaining a reasonably good estimation of the errors .",
    "the volume of the millennium simulation is @xmath51 , which is enough for most of our stellar mass and luminosity subsamples , and only slightly smaller than those of the samples @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "we note that the error estimation in this paper makes use of only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the mock catalogues , and so the errors on different scales for a given sample are correlated to varying degrees .",
    "however , we argue that this is not an issue in our case where we use these errors mainly to indicate the relative differences in the 2pcf and the 3pcf measured at given scale between different samples .",
    "we also note that the possible systematic errors in our estimation of the galaxy stellar mass and also the photometric errors in the galaxy color are not considered .",
    "these errors would not change our conclusions of the dependence on galaxy properties since they would not significantly mix the galaxy samples .",
    "we begin by estimating the two - dimensional , redshift - space , two - point auto - correlation function , @xmath54 , for each of the samples listed in table [ tab : sample ] using the estimator of @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the data - data , data - random and random - random pair counts , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the pair separations perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight . to normalize appropriately",

    "we have corrected the effect of fiber collisions in the same way as in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "next , we integrate these two - dimensional correlation estimates over the line - of - sight separation @xmath60 to obtain the projected auto - correlation function , @xmath70 , as follows , @xmath71 where we choose @xmath72mpc as the outer limit for the integration depth ( in order to reduce the noise from distant uncorrelated regions ) so that the summation for computing @xmath70 runs from @xmath73mpc to @xmath74mpc , given that we use bins of width @xmath75mpc .",
    "in addition to @xmath70 , we also measure the one - dimensional auto - correlation function in redshift space , @xmath76 , using the same estimator as in equation ( [ eqn : landy - szalay ] ) but as a function of @xmath77 , the redshift - space three - dimensional ( 3d ) pair separation , which is given by @xmath78 .    in figure  [ fig:2pcf ] , we present the measurements of @xmath70 ( top panels ) and @xmath76 ( bottom panels ) for the four stellar - mass - selected samples and also the color subsamples .",
    "the errors are estimated from the 80 mock catalogs as described in the previous section .",
    "we note that the stellar - mass sample of @xmath79 shows a significantly different trend from all other samples .",
    "it is caused by the large cosmic variance due to its small volume , which can also be inferred from its small mean redshift , @xmath80 .",
    "similar behavior is also found for faint galaxies in the luminosity bin of @xmath81 @xcite , which has a similar mean redshift as this sample .",
    "therefore , in order to better constrain the dependence of the reduced 3pcfs on the stellar mass , we will ignore this sample in the following sections . in all other cases ,",
    "both @xmath70 and @xmath76 show systematic trends with galaxy stellar mass , reflecting the different masses of the hosting halos , with more massive galaxies residing in more massive halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this trend is shown more clearly in the blue subsamples .",
    "because most of the blue galaxies of these stellar masses are central galaxies , the different hosting - halo masses will have stronger effects on the amplitudes of @xmath70 . on the contrary",
    ", the two less massive red - galaxy samples ( @xmath82 ) show strong small - scale clustering .",
    "it can be caused by their high satellite fractions that increase the clustering amplitude , though they are located in lower - mass halos @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the projected 2pcf can be decomposed into two components : a steeper inner part at pair separations below @xmath83mpc and a flatter outer part at larger separations . in the language of the `` halo model '' ( see ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inner part is called the _ one - halo _ term , where the pair counts are mostly galaxy pairs in the same halo , and the outer part is referred to as the _ two - halo _ term , where galaxy pairs are mostly from two separate halos .",
    "the separation , where the transition between the two terms occurs , increases with increasing stellar mass . in the two - halo term",
    ", the amplitude of @xmath70 is an increasing function of stellar mass , while its slope shows weak or no stellar mass dependence .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that , on large scales , the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the bias in the distribution of dark matter halos .",
    "when compared to the projected correlation function , the @xmath76 measurements are relatively suppressed on small scales , leading to almost no transition between the one - halo and two - halo terms .",
    "this is caused by the rsd effect on small scales and the global infall toward high - density regions on large scales .",
    "both the projected and redshift - space 2pcfs have been extensively studied in the literature using both sdss - based samples ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such a stellar - mass dependence of @xmath108 is contrary to the stellar - mass dependence of @xmath151 , because the stellar - mass dependence of @xmath160 in equation ( [ eqn : qs ] ) is much stronger than that of @xmath108 .",
    "this can be understood from the larger galaxy bias of those more massive galaxies . in the second - order perturbation theory ,",

    ", we conclude that @xmath160 varies much stronger ( @xmath170 ) with different stellar - mass samples than @xmath108 .    when assuming constant galaxy biases @xmath165 and @xmath166 , the natural derivation from equation ( [ eqn : zetab ] ) is ( see , e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the galaxy and dark - matter reduced 3pcfs , respectively . in the linear bias model",
    "where @xmath174 , @xmath172 is proportional to @xmath175 , consistent with the trend shown in figure [ fig : qstellar ] .",
    "however , such explanations of the dependence of the reduced 3pcf , @xmath151 , on the stellar mass are only qualitative , since the galaxy bias on these nonlinear scales is strongly scale dependent , as shown in figure [ fig:2pcfbias ] . moreover ,",
    "when using the redshift - space 3pcf to measure the galaxy bias , the rsd effect should be carefully taken into account @xcite .",

    "@xcite measured @xmath151 on scales from @xmath177 to @xmath178 and found significant configuration dependence , consistent with our measurements on similar scales . in order to identify the correct scale of the triangle , we define the scale @xmath179 as the maximum of @xmath180 .",
    "our measurements on these small scales show that the clustering hierarchy , @xmath9 , would be more accurate when applied on small scales .    comparing figures [ fig : qstellar ] and [ fig : zetas ]",
    ", we find that while @xmath108 decreases with the scale , the scale dependence of @xmath151 is twofold . for elongated triangle shapes ( @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) , @xmath151 increases with scale , while for the perpendicular triangles ( @xmath183 )",
    ", there is a weak trend for @xmath151 to decrease as the scale increases .",
    "these two effects make @xmath151 show a much stronger shape dependence on larger scales . on large scales",
    ", galaxies tend to be more clustered in linear structures , such as filaments @xcite .",
    "less massive galaxies have a stronger shape dependence and are thus possibly more abundant in these linear structures .",
    "since galaxies of different stellar mass generally have different shapes of the 2pcf @xcite , it is indeed expected to find the degeneracy of the stellar - mass and shape dependence on large scales .",
    "the case @xmath184 for @xmath151 is very special , because it shows a quite different configuration dependence as in other panels . with such triangles ,",
    "the 3pcf can measure scales less than @xmath126 when @xmath185 and the maximum scale @xmath179 of the triangle is @xmath126 .",
    "it seems that the configuration dependence of @xmath151 shown in this way is determined by @xmath186 of the triangle .",
    "if we define @xmath179 as the scale , we can use the angle @xmath187 subtended by @xmath179 as the configuration @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the mild shape dependence of @xmath151 seen in the top panels of figure  [ fig : qstellar ] when @xmath185 is caused by the fact that the @xmath187 subtended by @xmath179 is only in the range of @xmath188 $ ] , where the variation of @xmath151 with @xmath187 is small .",

    "the downturn of signals in the first one or two bins ( @xmath181 ) in the top panels of figure [ fig : qstellar ] can be caused by low s / n of small numbers of triplet counts or by the residual fiber - collision effect since the fiber collision in our measurements is not well corrected below the fiber - collision scale ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "we present the stellar - mass dependence for the projected - space reduced 3pcf , @xmath189 , in figure [ fig : pstellar ] .",
    "similar to the reduced 3pcf , @xmath151 , in redshift space , @xmath143 does not have a strong stellar - mass dependence , implying that the stellar - mass dependence of the reduced 3pcf is not significantly affected by the rsd effect . in figure",
    "[ fig : pq ] , we compare @xmath151 and @xmath143 for the sample of @xmath190 .",

    "it is possible that the shape dependence shown in their figures is somewhat smoothed out by their choice of the parameterization ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite compared the measurements of the reduced 3pcf in real and redshift spaces for scales down to @xmath191 using the @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "they found a significant configuration dependence of @xmath1 in real space and concluded that the rsds attenuate the shape dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "since the projected correlation function is directly related to the real - space correlation function @xcite , the weaker shape dependence of @xmath143 seems to contradict the predictions from the simulations in real space .",
    "this could be caused by the possible selection effects or systematics in the survey that suppress the shape dependence in the projected space .",
    "we will study this further using mock galaxy catalogs in future work .",
    "we show the color dependence of @xmath151 and @xmath143 for different stellar - mass samples in figures [ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] . the red triangles and blue squares are for the red and blue galaxies defined in section [ sec : data ] , respectively . the results for all the galaxies in the stellar - mass samples are also shown as black lines .",
    "we only display the results for the case of @xmath152 .",
    "the measurement errors for the blue galaxies in the top right panels of figures [ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] are very large because of the shot - noise errors of small numbers of triplet counts at these small scales .",
    "the differences between the 3pcfs of the red and blue galaxies are more significant for less massive samples and on smaller scales . for the most massive galaxy sample in the right panels of figures",
    "[ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] , there is no significant dependence on color , considering the large errors on the measurements of blue galaxies .",
    "although the fraction of red to blue galaxies changes with the stellar - mass subsamples considered , it only affects the shot - noise levels of the measurements of different color samples and should not change the color dependence of @xmath151 and @xmath143 .    using high - resolution @xmath3-body simulations , @xcite",
    "demonstrate that equation ( [ eqn : bias ] ) can be applied to measure the linear and nonlinear galaxy bias even on small scales where the second - order perturbation theory fails and the bias factors become scale dependent .",
    "the red galaxies are found to have a higher clustering amplitude than the blue galaxies in the 2pcf measurements @xcite , i.e. , red galaxies have a larger linear galaxy bias , @xmath165 .",
    "for linear - bias models , we expect @xmath151 and @xmath143 for red galaxies to be somewhat smaller than those for blue galaxies , contrary to the results in figures [ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] .",
    "this implies that the linear - bias model is not enough to describe the galaxy bias of different color samples , i.e. , the nonlinear bias factor , @xmath166 , would not be negligible and plays an important role in the modeling of the reduced 3pcf for galaxies of different colors .",
    "considering that @xmath165 and @xmath1 are both larger for red galaxies , we infer from equation ( [ eqn : bias ] ) that the nonlinear bias @xmath166 of the red galaxies would also be larger than that of the blue ones .",
    "because of the scale dependence of the bias factors , constant bias models are only accurate on large scales and precise measurements of the dark matter 3pcf is required for accurate estimation of the bias factors @xcite . comparing figures [ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] , it seems that the rsd effect is stronger for the red galaxies , especially on small scales , while the blue galaxies suffer less from the rsd .    in the 2pcf ,",
    "the differences between the clustering strength of the red and blue galaxies become smaller in more luminous galaxy samples and on larger scales @xcite .",
    "we also find a similar trend in @xmath151 and @xmath143 . in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : qcolor ] and [ fig : pcolor ] , @xmath151 and @xmath143 for the red and blue galaxies are more similar on large scales and in more massive galaxy samples .",
    "it implies that the galaxy bias factors would have less dependence on color for massive galaxies on large scales , which provides the opportunity to use massive galaxies irrespective of color to correctly measure the large - scale bias in galaxy redshift surveys .    considering the significant differences of red and blue galaxies in the low - mass end , the 3pcf can provide powerful constraints to the formation and evolution of the low mass galaxies",
    ". the higher reduced 3pcf @xmath151 or @xmath143 for these low - mass red galaxies on small scales reflects the different distributions of red and blue galaxies within the dark matter halos . from the perspective of the halo model ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the small - scale contribution to the 3pcf mostly comes from the one - halo term where triplets of galaxies reside in the same halos . since the red galaxies of such low stellar masses are mostly satellite galaxies in relatively massive halos and most of these blue galaxies are central galaxies @xcite , the lack of one - halo central  satellite  satellite and satellite  satellite  satellite contributions from the blue galaxies results in the lower amplitudes of @xmath151 and @xmath143 .",
    "similarly , the small differences of the reduced 3pcf for red and blue galaxies in the high - stellar - mass samples reflect the similar satellite fractions of different colors . the clustering differences in the low - mass end",
    "could also relate to the different environments of the low - mass red and blue galaxies , since the red galaxies tend to populate denser regions @xcite .",
    "we note that for low - mass samples , red galaxies have a stronger shape dependence than the blue galaxies , especially on large scales .",
    "this indicates that the low - mass red galaxies are more influenced by the large - scale structure and preferentially populate the filamentary structures .",
    "in this paper , we measure the stellar mass and color dependence of the galaxy 3pcf using the sdss dr7 main sample galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath18 .",
    "we also investigate the scale and shape dependence of the 3pcf for samples of different stellar mass and color in both redshift and projected spaces .    in the redshift space ,",
    "the dependence of the reduced 3pcf , @xmath151 , on the stellar mass is very weak .",
    "slightly stronger dependence on stellar mass shows up on small scales , where there is a trend that more massive galaxies have lower amplitudes of @xmath151 , consistent with the finding that more luminous galaxies have smaller @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath151 can be qualitatively understood from the larger linear bias of more massive galaxies using the second - order perturbation theories .",
    "the reduced 3pcf , @xmath151 , is also dependent on the scale and shape of the triangle , which provides measurements of the 3d spatial distribution in the galaxies .",
    "we find that the shape dependence of @xmath151 is stronger on larger scales , reflecting the fact that the filamentary structures dominate the large - scale distribution .",
    "more massive galaxies show weaker shape dependence of @xmath151 , which is possibly resulting from the high occupancy of low - mass galaxies in the filamentary structures .",
    "the reduced 3pcf , @xmath151 , only has weak shape dependence on small scales , regardless of the stellar mass , meaning that the hierarchical clustering model @xmath9 would be more accurate on these small scales .",
    "to study the effect of rsd , we also measure the similar dependence of the projected - space reduced 3pcf @xmath143 on stellar mass , scale , and the triangle shape .",
    "we find no strong dependence of @xmath143 on the stellar mass at different scales and triangle shapes , as in the redshift space .",
    "it means that the weak stellar - mass dependence is not caused by the rsd effect .",
    "weaker shape dependence is found for @xmath143 than that of redshift - space 3pcf @xmath151 , which is different from the expectation that rsd attenuates the shape dependence of the reduced 3pcf .",

    "the color dependence is stronger for low - mass galaxies and on small scales , reflecting the different distributions of low - mass red and blue galaxies in the small - scale structures .",
    "the low - mass red galaxies have higher 2pcf clustering amplitudes and also higher @xmath151 values , which indicates that the linear bias models are not sufficient to predict the 3pcf distribution of various color samples",

    "for example , from the reduced 3pcf of the low - mass red galaxies , we conclude that on large scales these galaxies preferentially populate the filamentary structures . on small scales , they are more clustered than the blue galaxies of similar masses and populate denser regions .",
    "the failure of the linear bias model for the color samples is also consistent with the fact that most of these low - mass red galaxies are satellite galaxies and their nonlinear evolution is important .    since the different behaviors in the spatial clustering of 3pcf reflect the different formation and merger history of galaxies , we will use the 3pcf measurements in this work to test the galaxy formation and evolution models using detailed halo occupation models and also connect the relation of galaxy stellar masses and host halo masses in our future work .",
    "the study of the stellar mass dependence of the 3pcf will help further constrain the galaxy formation and evolution models when combined with the information of the star formation rates , merger histories , and even the active galactic nucleus feedback of the different stellar mass samples in the semi - analytical models .",
