    "university courses in conceptual physics and astronomy typically serve as students terminal science experience .",
    "significant work has gone into developing research - verified pedagogical methods for pre - service teachers and the algebra- and calculus - based physics courses typically populated by natural and physical science majors;@xcite however , there is significantly less volume in the literature concerning the non - science , general education population.@xcite this is quickly changing , and large , repeatable gains on concept tests are being reported , specifically within the astronomy education community.@xcite    student scientific reasoning and metacognition are increasingly being investigated within the physics education community , as well , though most studies use datasets consisting mostly of science majors.@xcite bao et .",
    "al demonstrate that although us college - level science students perform poorly with respect to physics content knowledge relative to their chinese peers , there is no significant difference between the two groups with respect to scientific reasoning , and that both groups demonstrate reasonable preparation.@xcite it is encouraging that students self - selecting a science major demonstrate competence in scientific reasoning at the post secondary level .",
    "however , there is little data on the general education student population , which will comprise a greater percentage of the professional population .",
    "since most students enrolled in conceptual physics or astronomy will never take another formal science course , our student learning objectives should incorporate broader reasoning skills . scientific reasoning and metacognitive development",
    "are often required for effective decision - making and problem solving far outside the typical scientific context.@xcite furthermore , it has been shown that gains in content knowledge are strongly correlated to scientific reasoning.@xcite in particular , reasoning and meta - cognition development are essential for problem solving , understanding and applying abstract concepts , and shifting between multiple representations.@xcite however , non - stem majors may enter the classroom with a disadvantage not necessarily shared by their self - selecting science major peers .",
    "acknowledgement of the potential dramatic difference in reasoning ability is important for development of good pedagogy .",
    "furthermore gains in content knowledge achieved via research - verified , active - engagement curriculum may not necessarily lead to gains in scientific reasoning.@xcite in fact , the content - specific education literature in other disciplines suggests that explicit intervention is necessary to improve reasoning.@xcite it is this explicit intervention that is currently lacking in many pedagogical models that address this student population in physics and astronomy , specifically those models practical for implementation with a large student - to - faculty ratio .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the post - secondary scientific reasoning abilities of non - stem students using lawson s classroom test of scientific reasoning ( lctsr).@xcite the purpose is to determine where the general education population is with respect to scientific reasoning in order to inform future pedagogies aimed at improving scientific reasoning within this group .",
    "we classify students into one of three formal reasoning levels as described by piaget s theory of cognitive development : concrete operational , transitional , and formal operational.@xcite furthermore , we investigate the types of content with which non - stem students struggle , and correlate learning gains for this content to preparation in scientific reasoning .",
    "finally , we look at the effectiveness of `` reformed '' pedagogy for learning gains in scientific reasoning , and discuss possible implications for instruction .",
    "in this section , we review the piagetian levels of formal reasoning , the assessment of scientific reasoning , and the connection between reasoning level and potential gains in specific types of content knowledge .",
    "we also discuss our specific student population and the types of courses in which these students enroll .",
    "what exactly constitutes scientific reasoning is both complex and debatable .",
    "lawson suggests that scientific reasoning has a structure that is chiefly hypothetico - deductive in nature and consisting of interrelated aspects , such as proportional reasoning , control of variables , probability reasoning and correlation reasoning.@xcite inductive and deductive process are involved , with some researchers intimately linking reasoning with the process of drawing inferences from initial premises.@xcite    more recently , kuhn has suggested that scientific reasoning is more than inductive inference , but a truth - seeking social process that involves the coordination of theory and evidence.@xcite kuhn and others specifically suggest that reasoning process can not be separated from prior knowledge.@xcite similarily , the learning of content and reasoning development have been linked in the physics education literature.@xcite as we will discuss further , content gains are significantly more difficult to achieve with underprepared students vs. well prepared students , and gains in reasoning only materialize with explicit intervention .",
    "piaget s theory of cognitive development includes classification into two formal reasoning levels ( concrete operational and formal operational ) with a transitional stage between the two.@xcite student s classified as mostly concrete operational reasoners are characterized by their appropriate use of logic ; however , they struggle with solving problems outside of a concrete context , demonstrating significant difficulty with abstract concepts and hypothetical tasks .",
    "formal operational reasoners begin to think abstractly , reason logically , and draw conclusions from available information .",
    "furthermore , unlike the concrete operational reasoner , they are able to apply appropriate logic to hypothetical situations in most contexts . in this way",
    ", formal operational reasoners can begin to think like a scientist , and specifically develop strong hypothetico - deductive reasoning .",
    "transitional reasoners fall between the other two classifications where they find success with hypothetical tasks in some contexts .",
    "lawson describes these levels as level 0 , low level 1 , and high level 1 , respectively.@xcite lawson further describes a post - formal level of reasoning , which is beyond the scope of this study . in this paper",
    ", we will use the traditional piagetian labels .",
    "it has been shown that the lctsr can be used as an assessment of formal reasoning level , and its validity has been established.@xcite specifically , lawson investigated the development of scientific reasoning and formal reasoning level in introductory college biology.@xcite for physics , ates et .",
    "al correlate formal reasoning level to conceptual understanding and problem - solving skills in introductory mechanics.@xcite in both of these studies , student populations consist primarily of science majors or science education prospective teachers . in the present study",
    ", we assess formal reasoning level of non - science , general education students at the college level .",
    "we have used the 2000 revised , multiple - choice edition of the lctsr , which assesses reasoning patterns such as proportional reasoning , control of variables , probability reasoning , correlation reasoning and hypothetico - deductive reasoning.@xcite the lctsr consists of 12 scenarios followed by two questions each assessing 6 different scientific reasoning patterns .",
    "each reasoning pattern is addressed by two question pairs .",
    "one question in a pair elicits a response requiring effective use of the pattern , while the second question has the student describe the reasoning behind the response .",
    "overall there are 12 questions designed to assess application of a reasoning pattern , and 12 questions designed to evaluate the student s personal approach to that application .",
    "requiring students to commit to a specific reason for their answers prevents them from achieving correct answers for the incorrect reasons . in order for a student to receive a `` correct '' score",
    ", they must answer both questions within a scenario correctly .    with respect to specific content ,",
    "lawson has shown that content can be classified into three categories : descriptive , hypothetical , and theoretical.@xcite content categorized as descriptive includes concepts having directly observable exemplars .",
    "examples include more concrete content requiring no more than rote memorization , and/or directly observable content such as the conservation of mass , bulb brightness in circuits , reflection and refraction in optics , and moon phases .",
    "content categorized as theoretical includes concepts without directly observable exemplars .",
    "examples within physics include the more abstract concepts of force , energy , and vector fields .",
    "hypothetical content typically involves observable exemplars ; however , typically over a time or space scale that makes direct observation impossible .",
    "lawson demonstrates that concrete operational reasoners can learn descriptive content with relative ease , whereas they struggle with theoretical and hypothetical content .",
    "formal operational reasoners do relatively well with most content .",
    "the dataset used in this study consists of students enrolled in either a conceptual physics or astronomy course with one of the authors during the past three years .",
    "the conceptual physics course is based on _",
    "physics by inquiry _ ( pbi ) , which is a guided - inquiry approach to content in which the primary emphasis is on discovering rather than memorizing and in which teaching is by questioning rather than by telling.@xcite over the past three years , this course was taught using a large - enrollment implementation similar to that reported by scherr.@xcite for two years , this course was taught at longwood university in farmville , va , which is a primarily - undergraduate , regional comprehensive institution . for one year this course was taught at coastal carolina university ( ccu ) in conway , sc .",
    "coastal carolina is a similar comprehensive , regional institution . at longwood",
    ", this course was taught in a traditional lecture room with between 50 - 70 students and one instructor .",
    "like scherr , students proceeded through pbi materials in groups , but with whole - class checkouts rather than instructor - intensive , individual group checkouts .",
    "at ccu , the course was taught in a lecture room designed for the student centered activities for large enrollment university physics ( scale - up ) model.@xcite a scale - up course incorporates the high - impact practice of collaborative assignments and projects by fusing lecture , laboratory and recitation into a single entity . although the courses at longwood were taught in a traditional classroom setting , the principles of the scale - up model where implemented as much as was feasible .",
    "the conceptual astronomy course ws taught over the past three years at ccu in the same scale - up classroom used for the conceptual physics course .",
    "an implementation of _ lecture tutorials in introductory astronomy _ and peer instruction was used with this course.@xcite typical classes had enrollments of between 30 - 40 students with two instructors .",
    "we have found that students in our conceptual physics and astronomy courses score significantly lower on the lctsr compared to students enrolled in courses typically populated with science majors .",

    "however , such a dramatic difference in reasoning ability between stem and non - stem students may contribute to disparities in effectiveness of reformed physics pedagogies .",
    "what works in calculus - based physics courses with natural and physical science students , may not work in the general - education , conceptual physics course .    to better understand our student population ,",
    "we have investigated non - stem student weaknesses with respect to scientific reasoning . specifically , we looked at the formal reasoning level for the average non - stem student and determined which scientific reasoning patterns presented the most difficulty for this population .      using individual student scores on the lctsr , we classified students into three formal reasoning categories : concrete operational ( co ) , transitional ( t ) , and formal operational ( fo ) .",
    "as described by lawson , students scoring below 25% on the lctsr were classified as operational reasoners , students scoring between 25% and 58% were classified as transitional reasoners , and students scoring above 58% were classified as formal operational reasoners.@xcite as previously mentioned , a student must correctly answer both questions within a scenario in order to receive credit .",
    "there are 24 questions on the lctsr , with 12 different scenarios assessing 6 different reasoning patterns .",
    "percentages were calculated based on the 12 scenarios .",
    "figure [ fig : distribution - of - non - stem ] shows the distribution of non - stem students within piagetian formal reasoning levels .",
    "a significant majority of non - stem students ( 56% ) are classified as transitional reasoners .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous studies of the general education population in introductory biology courses for the non - major.@xcite it should be noted that the majority of science majors in an introductory , calculus- or algebra - based physics course would , on average , be classified within the formal operational category , which is also observed in the biology education literature for the stem - based biology introductory courses.@xcite    ]      figure [ fig : lctsr - patterns ] shows the population averages for specific scientific reasoning patterns as assessed by the lctsr .",
    "students within the observed population demonstrated significant difficulty with proportional reasoning , isolation of variables , and hypothetico - deductive reasoning . of particular interest ,",
    "scores on lctsr questions designed to test application of hypothetico - deductive reasoning , which can arguably be called the scientific method , average to an abysmal 30% . students within this population demonstrated the poorest performance on proportional reasoning ( 25% ) , which could be attributable to poor preparation in mathematics .",
    "surprisingly , most students demonstrate some proficiency with correctional and probabilistic reasoning .",
    "the dramatic difference between performance on probabilistic / correctional reasoning and proportional reasoning is puzzling .",
    "it is possible that the standard secondary school curriculum includes more explicit instruction on these reasoning patterns .    ]    as instructors we must be careful not to assume pre - existing knowledge , specifically with respect to content requiring use of these patterns . for example , choice of appropriate scale is essential when graphing data and/or moving between multiple representations .",
    "furthermore , qualitative approaches to physical systems may be more difficult for this population , due to a lack of proficiency with proportion .",
    "it is evident that more explicit instruction in scientific reasoning is necessary , specifically with respect to hypothesis construction and testing , proportions , and isolation of variables .",
    "analysis of students scientific reasoning level introduces several implication for instruction . in particular",
    ", we expect transitional and concrete operational reasoners to have difficulty with theoretical content .",
    "this difficulty could result in low learning gains on concept inventories for these students when compared to formal operational reasoners receiving similar instruction .",
    "as others have previously demonstrated , pre - existing knowledge and skill sets do contribute to the maximum achievable learning gain in physics.@xcite    in this section , we look at the correlation between pre - existing scientific reasoning ability and learning gains for various classifications of content . specifically , is there a stronger correlation between lctsr pre - score and normalized learning gain for more theoretical content in comparison to descriptive content ?",
    "we also discuss whether content - driven pedagogies significantly contribute to gains in scientific reasoning .",
    "is a guided - inquiry based approach to learning science sufficient for the development of scientific reasoning ?",
    "lawson demonstrated a connection between concept construction and developmental level in college biology.@xcite we expect a similar connection to be prevalent in a physics context .",
    "specifically , we expect to see a correlation between scientific reasoning and knowledge gains in a physics - based context .",
    "coletta and phillips observed a strong correlation between normalized gain on the fci and pre - instruction lctsr scores.@xcite during assessment for our conceptual physics courses over the past two years , we have observed similar strong correlations between pre - instruction lctsr scores and normalized gain on two concept inventories , the determining and interpreting resistive electric circuits concept test ( direct ) and the test for understanding graphs  kinematics ( tug - k).@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tug - k - vs .- lctsr ] , a strong correlation is seen for content requiring higher - order and more abstract reasoning . with a slope of linear fit of 0.64 and r=0.59 ,",
    "the correlation between tug - k normalized gain and lctsr score is similar to that seen for the fci and stronger than the correlation observed for the direct assessment [ slope=0.45 and r=0.50 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : direct - vs .- lctsr ] ) ] .    ]    ]    the tug - k tests a students ability to move between multiple representations , which rely on higher - order and more abstract thinking .",
    "the fci assesses a students knowledge and application of the abstract concept of force .",
    "these concepts can be classified as mostly theoretical , requiring advanced reasoning development to achieve success .",
    "a weaker correlation between direct gains and lctsr scores could be because strong scores are possible on direct via good observation and retention from well - designed inquiry - based activities ; many of the questions are based on content with explicit , concrete exemplars that are directly observed during the course .",
    "this suggests that if we wish to push our non - science students past the lower three levels of blooms taxonomy of educational objectives , then we may need our courses to focus explicitly on scientific reasoning early and often.@xcite      even with significant disadvantages , substantial gains in content knowledge can still be obtained in conceptual physics and astronomy courses , especially when those courses are designed around a research - verified , active - engagement curriculum .",
    "table [ tab : non - explicit - lctsr ] shows average normalized learning gains on direct , tug - k and the star properties concept inventory ( spci)@xcite for a subset of students enrolled in our courses over the past three years .",
    "although lower than reported for students completing some active - engagement algebra- and calculus - based courses , these gains are still significant . even though we have been relatively successful with content , we have failed to improve reasoning ability .",

    "however , it should be pointed out that we have implemented an adaptation of pbi that strays in some significant ways from the intentions of the curriculum designers . therefore , the data should not be interpreted as condemnation of any particular pedagogy .",
    "furthermore , this does not to suggest that gains in reasoning are unachievable .",
    "the content - specific education literature in other disciplines suggests that explicit intervention is necessary to improve reasoning.@xcite",
    "there are three main conclusions from this work that have implications for physics and astronomy instruction with this population : ( 1 ) reformed pedagogy focused on content alone is not necessarily sufficient to achieve gains in scientific reasoning ; ( 2 ) scientific reasoning can be strongly correlated to gains in content knowledge , especially content categorized as theoretical ; and ( 3 ) students entering our conceptual physics and astronomy courses demonstrate poor preparation in some scientific reasoning patterns .",

    "we will briefly discuss how these findings can be used to inform the development of new pedagogies .",
    "specifically , we discuss the necessity of making scientific reasoning explicit within our conceptual physics and astronomy courses and the affect topic sequence could have on student learning .",
    "the content - specific education literature in other disciplines suggests that explicit intervention is necessary to improve reasoning.@xcite in fact , we are beginning to see significantly larger gains in scientific reasoning via explicit instruction during our most recent courses , though these observations are preliminary .",
    "for example , lawson presents a series of activities that lead students through the process of constructing good if ... and ... then ( iat ) statements in various fields of knowledge , though with a focus on applications within the biology content of his courses.@xcite in this way , hypothetico - deductive reasoning is being made explicit .",
    "we have begun introducing these types of activities within our course with preliminary success . as an example , pbi has students design an experiment that would address the question does a light bulb use up current ?",
    "we formalize the process by forcing students to construct an appropriate iat statement that is specifically designed to falsify a claim . based on observations from a test class consisting of 15 students from both the physics major and general education population ,",
    "we have found that students initially struggle with iat statement construction but gradually improve .",
    "we combined these activities with activities explicitly targeting other reasoning patterns ( proportional , control of variables , probability reasoning , correlation reasoning ) all mixed within the actual content as laid out in pbi .",
    "this explicit approach to reasoning development appears to result in increased gains on the lctsr and conceptual inventories . as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : explicit - lctsr ] , an average normalized gain of 68% ( n=14 ) was achieved on the lctsr in comparison to 11% ( n=42 ) for previous courses taught similarly with respect to content , though lacking explicit reasoning intervention .",

    "[ tab : explicit - lctsr ] .",
    "although our preliminary sample is small , these preliminary results are encouraging , and combined with results from the education literature in other fields , points to a potential high - reward approach .",

    "an examination of several conceptual physics and physical science textbooks shows that the average university course begins with topics in mechanics , specifically motion , force , and energy .",
    "these more theoretical concepts are the hardest in which to achieve significant learning gains with this population of students ; however , they are typically the first topics covered in the traditional conceptual physics course .    a topic sequence where more concrete content is initially introduced along with explicit instruction in scientific reasoning may lead to better performance in theoretical content later in the course . as an example ,",
    "much of the content within the topics of circuits and optics have directly observable exemplars , which makes them ideal candidates for introductory material . with regards to circuits",
    ", mcdermott has shown that no formal instruction in electrostatics or field theories are needed to successfully build a predictive model.@xcite it may be beneficial for students in conceptual astronomy to begin with observation - based activities and physical model building , such as the celestial sphere . gradually increasing the amount of hypothetical and theoretical content as reasoning develops could build student confidence in handling physics while better preparing them for theoretical content .",
    "in summary , we have found that non - stem majors taking either a conceptual physics or astronomy course at two regional comprehensive institutions score significantly lower pre - instruction on the lctsr in comparison to stem majors .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong correlation between pre - instruction lctsr scores and normalized gains on concept inventories .",
    "the correlation is strongest for content that can be categorized as mostly theoretical , meaning a lack of directly observable exemplars , and weakest for content categorized as mostly descriptive , where directly observable exemplars are abundant .    although the implementation of research - verified , interactive engagement pedagogy can lead to gains in content knowledge , significant gains in theoretical content ( such as force and energy )",
    "are more difficult with this population of students .",
    "we also observe no significant gains on the lctsr without explicit instruction in scientific reasoning patterns .",
    "this has several implications for instruction , such as the necessity for explicit instruction , and the potential need for a reassessment of the canonical sequence of topics in conceptual physics and astronomy .",
    "these results further demonstrate that differences in student populations are important when comparing normalized gains on concept inventories , and the achievement of significant gains in scientific reasoning requires a re - evaluation of the traditional approach to physics for non - stem populations .",
