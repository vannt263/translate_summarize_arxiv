    "the processing of a high volume of information and world wide communication is , at the present , based on semiconductor technology , whereas information storage devices rely on multilayers of magnetic metals and insulators .",
    "semiconductor spintronics offers a possible direction of technological research towards the development of hybrid devices that could perform logic operations , communication and storage , within the same material technology : information could be stored in a system of polarized electron spins @xcite , transferred as attached to mobile carriers and finally detected .",
    "the possibility of obtaining long spin relaxation times or spin diffusion lengths in electronic materials makes spintronics a viable prospective technology .",
    "nevertheless , the designers of spin devices have to worry about the loss of spin polarization ( spin coherence ) before , during and after the necessary manipulations .",
    "in particular , efficient injection , transport , control and detection of spin polarization must be carefully treated  @xcite .",
    "electron - spin states depolarize by scattering with imperfections or elementary excitations of the medium , such as phonons .",
    "furthermore , miniaturization process brings the system to experience very intense electric fields , even when the applied voltages are very low .",
    "this means that , for the operability of prospective spintronic devices , the features of spin relaxation at relatively high electric fields should be firstly understood . in recent years",
    "there was a proliferation of experimental works in which the influence of transport conditions on relaxation of spins in semiconductors has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "all these works are focused on the study of coherent spin transport at low temperatures ( @xmath7 k ) and under the influence of weak electric fields ( @xmath8 kv / cm ) , except for few works  @xcite in which spin depolarization has been investigated with driving fields up to @xmath4 kv / cm .",
    "the temporal evolution of the spin and the evolution of the momentum of an electron can not be separated .",
    "the spin depolarization rates are functionals of the electron distribution function in momentum space which continuously evolves with time when an electric field is applied to drive the transport .",
    "thus , the dephasing rate is a dynamic variable that needs to be treated self - consistently in step with the dynamic evolution of the electron s momentum . a way to solve",
    "this problem is to describe the transport of spin polarization by making use of boltzmann - like kinetic equations .",
    "this can be done within the density matrix approach @xcite , methods of nonequilibrium green s functions , as the microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation approach @xcite , or wigner functions @xcite , where spin property is accounted for starting from quantum mechanics equations .",
    "another way is to use a semiclassical monte carlo approach , by taking into account the spin polarization dynamics with the inclusion in the code of the precession mechanism of the spin polarization vector  @xcite .",
    "both methods allow to include the relevant spin relaxation phenomena for electron systems and take into account the details of electron scattering mechanisms , material properties and specific device design ; their predictions have been demonstrated to be in good agreement with experiments .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the transport of spin - polarized electrons have been also achieved by the drift - diffusion approximation .",
    "the existing drift - diffusion schemes can be classified into two approaches accounting the spin degree of freedom differently : the two - component drift - diffusion model and the density - matrix based approximations @xcite .",
    "general conditions for the applicability of these approximations are not different from the usual conditions of applicability of drift - diffusion approximations .    despite decades of studies ,",
    "most of theoretical or simulative works have considered only the central valley @xmath5 since the spin - orbit coupling parameters of the upper conduction bands have been only recently theoretically calculated by fu et al .",
    "monte carlo approaches have been widely adopted by groups of scientists to study spin polarized transport in 2d channels , heterostructures , quantum wells , quantum wires  @xcite . however , till today , to the best of our knowledge , in semiconductor bulk structures a theoretical investigation of the influence of transport conditions on the spin depolarization in the presence of high electric fields , comprehensive of the effects of both lattice temperature and impurity density , is still lacking .",
    "+ aim of this work is to numerically estimate the spin lifetimes of an ensemble of initially - polarized electrons drifting in doped n - type gaas bulks , with the lattice temperature , doping density and electric field amplitude ranging in a wide interval of values , focusing on the effects due to the inclusion of upper valleys of the semiconductor on the mechanism of depolarization . + the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "spin dephasing may be caused by interactions with local magnetic fields originating from nuclei and spin - orbit interactions or magnetic impurities .",
    "the most relevant spin relaxation mechanisms for an electron system under non degenerate regime are : ( i ) the elliott - yafet ( ey ) mechanism , in which electron spins have a small chance to flip during each scattering , due to the spin mixing in the conduction band @xcite ; ( ii ) the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism , based on the spin - orbit splitting of the conduction band in non - centrosymmetric semiconductors , in which the electron spins decay due to their precession around the * k*-dependent spin - orbit fields ( inhomogeneous broadening ) during the free flight between two successive scattering events @xcite ; ( iii ) the bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) mechanism , in which electrons exchange their spins with holes @xcite .",
    "hyperfine interaction is another mechanism , usually important for spin relaxation of localized electrons , but ineffective in metallic regime where most of the carriers are in extended states @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations indicate that the the ey mechanism is totally irrelevant on electron spin relaxation in n - type iii - v semiconductors .",
    "hence , in this work we analyze the spin depolarization of drifting electrons in n - type gaas semiconductors by considering only the dyakonov - perel process .    by following the semiclassical formalism",

    "the complete set of n - type gaas parameters used in our calculations is listed in ref .",
    "the scattering probabilities are calculated by the fermi golden rule and assumed to be both field and spin independent ; accordingly , the influence of the external fields is only indirect through the field - modified electron velocities .",

    "[ fig:3 ] shows that the spin precession frequency @xmath68 is an increasing monotonic function of @xmath33 . for @xmath70 kv / cm ,",
    "independently from the values of the doping density , the values of @xmath68 obtained at room temperature are larger than those obtained at @xmath59 k. the increase of the spin precession frequency for electrons moving at higher temperatures is explained by the increasing number of electron transitions from the @xmath5 to @xmath6 valleys , being the value of the spin - orbit coupling coefficient in the @xmath6-valleys one order of magnitude greater than that of @xmath5-valley . at @xmath59",
    "k , for @xmath70 kv / cm , the percentage of electrons in the central valley @xmath5 is practically unitary and the spin precession frequency increases as the third power of electron momentum @xmath31 , which increases with @xmath33 according to the eq .",

[ fig:4 ] ) . up to @xmath76",
    "k the decoherence times slightly depend on the temperature and are characterized by a marked maximum .",
    "the presence of a maximum in the spin depolarization time can be explained by the interplay between two competing factors , both due to the increase of the electric field . in the momentum space , at greater field amplitudes , the electrons occupy states with larger @xmath77 , characterized by a stronger spin - orbit coupling , causing an enhancement of the spin inhomogeneous broadening . on the other hand , a larger electric field also brings about an increase of the number of scattering events , giving rise to a reduction of the momentum relaxation time .",
    "this in turn causes an increase of the spin relaxation time as follows from eq .",
    "[ taus ] .    at low values of temperature and for electric field amplitudes",
    "@xmath78 kv / cm the inhomogeneous broadening is still marginal and the spin relaxation phenomenon is dominated by the momentum scattering .",
    "in particular , the number of electron scattering events , which are mainly due to interactions with acoustic phonons at very weak electric fields , increases its value because of the triggering of the scattering mechanism by ionized impurities , causing a reduction of @xmath69 . for field amplitudes greater than @xmath79",
    "kv / cm , the enhancement of the spin - orbit coupling , which is k - cubic dependent , is faster than the decrease on @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , the spin lifetime starts to decrease with the increasing of the electric field .",
    "the nonmonotonic electric field dependence of @xmath43 is not observed for @xmath80 k where , because of the greater drift electron velocities , the loss of spin polarization is mainly due to the strong effective magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , till today experimental investigations of the ultrafast relaxation of electron spin during drift transport in bulk semiconductors , at both sample temperatures higher than 30 k and applied field amplitudes greater than 0.1 kv / cm , are still missing .",
    "although the main aim of this work is the investigation of the influence of transport conditions on the spin relaxation of electrons driven by high - intensity electric fields , including the effects of choosing both the lattice temperature and impurity density in a wide range of values , in order to validate the prediction capability of our mc code , we have performed a comparison between our numerical spin relaxation times and very recent experimental results on the electron - spin - relaxation rate , obtained by ref .",
    "these experiments were carried out by performing spin noise spectroscopy on a sample of n - type gaas at a doping concentration of @xmath81 @xmath2 , without any driving field and for lattice temperatures @xmath50 between 4 and 80 k. in fig .",

    "our finding for the spin lifetime well agrees with the theoretical results in all the investigated range , while the values of the electron temperature are systematically slightly lower than those obtained from the ksbe approach .",

    "in fact , the electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering is very important in determining the hot - electron temperature and the hot - electron temperature influences both the electron - longitudinal optical ( e - lo ) phonon and the electron - impurity scattering .",
    "hence the e - e scattering effectively influences the spin relaxation .",
