    "w49b is one of the brightest galactic supernova remnant ( snrs ) in the radio ( moffett & reynolds 1994 ) and x - ray bands ( immler & kuntz 2005 ) .",
    "it exhibits incomplete radio shell with centrally filled thermal x - rays ( pye et al .",
    "1984 ; smith et al .",
    "1985 ) , which is the characteristic of mixed - morphology supernova remnants ( mm snrs ) ( rho & petre 1998 ) .",
    "however , at odds with typical mm snrs , its x - ray emission is ejecta - dominated ( smith et al .",
    "1985 ; fujimoto et al .  1995",
    "; hwang et al .  2000 ) and presents a central jet - like feature and a bright limb to the east ( miceli et al .",
    "2006 ; keohane et al .",
    "near - infrared narrow - band observations revealed a barrel - shaped structure with coaxial rings ( keohane et al .",
    "2007 ) , probably a remnant of a bipolar wind surrounding the massive progenitor star .",
    "the x - ray jet - like structure is along the axis of the barrel .",
    "a strip of shocked molecular hydrogen was also found in the eastern region just outside the shell , indicating that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud there .",
    "recently , a strong radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) associated with h - like fe was detected in the _ suzaku _ x - ray spectrum of w49b by ozawa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , thus showing the direct signature of overionization in the ejecta .",
    "miceli et al .  ( 2010 ) confirmed the rrc features by a spatially resolved spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data , and found that the overionized plasma is localized in the center of the remnant and in the western region , but not in the eastern region .",
    "the origin of such overionized recombining plasma is not well understood and rather counter - intuitive in objects like snrs where we mostly expect underionized plasma .",
    "kawasaki et al .  ( 2002 ) proposed that the hot interior of a snr can , under some circumstances , cool rapidly via thermal conduction with the cooler exterior , but yamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) pointed out some difficulties for this scenario . by analysing the observations of ic 443 , yamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reexamined the time scale of thermal conduction that account for overionization in kawasaki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and found that it is far longer than the remnant age .",
    "the thermal conduction alone therefore can not account for the observed overionized plasma in ic 443 , whose origin therefore remain still not well understood .    however , the estimate of yamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is based on the temperature difference between hot and cold x - ray emitting component .",
    "it may still be possible ( and indeed very probable ) that surrounding ism / csm inhomogeneities ( in the form of rings , large molecular clouds , cavity walls , etc . ) , once shocked , will give rise to a conductive thermal flux between the shocked molecular material and the inner part of the snr .",
    "this may be indeed the case of w49b , where the higher inner temperatures than ic 443 ( due to the lower age of the remnant ) may further increase the effects of thermal conduction with shocked inhomogeneities .",
    "to explain the morphology and chemical structure of w49b , two different scenarios have been proposed : either a bipolar explosion of the former supernova or a spherical supernova explosion expanding through a strongly inhomogeneous surrounding medium ( miceli et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 , keohane et al .",
    "2007 , lopez et al .  2009 ) .",
    "most of these authors leave both scenarios open , but lopez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) strongly supports the bipolar explosion scenario , on the base of the fe abundances measured with cie spectral analysis in several regions of w49b .",
    "however , as shown by ozawa et al.(2009 ) , the abundances are different if using either cie or overionization model . as a result , the conclusions of lopez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) may depend on the cie model they used . in the light of these considerations ,",
    "we believe that there is no observational evidence , at the present time , to prefer one of the two scenarios discussed above ; the case of a spherical explosion expanding through an inhomogeneous medium is still realistic if considering that the plasma may be in non - equilibrium of ionization . in this paper , we focus on the reproduction of the morphology and overionization pattern of w49b by adopting the simpliest snr model , describing a spherical explosion .",
    "we will explore the alternative scenario , namely the bipolar explosion , in a forthcoming paper .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a hydrodynamic model whose initial conditions were set up to describe appropriately w49b and investigate the physical origin of the peculiar morphology of the remnant and of the regions of overionization recently detected .",
    "the numerical model and the results are described in sect .  2 and sect .  3 , respectively ; the conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "our model describes the evolution of an originally spherical snr expanding through an inhomogeneous medium and , in particular , interacting with the surrounding dense clouds .",
    "the remnant evolution is modeled by numerically solving the time - dependent equations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation ( as described in orlando et al .",
    "2005 ) , taking into account the effects of thermal conduction ( including the effects of heat flux saturation ) and radiative losses from an optically thin plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "in addition , the model includes the deviations from equilibrium of ionization induced by the dynamics as described in reale & orlando ( 2008 ) . although our description is not entirely self - consistent ( since radiative losses are obtained assuming cie )",
    ", this does not significantly affect our results , because energy losses are dominated by transport by thermal conduction at all critical evolutionary phases ( e.g.  the interaction of the shock with the dense clouds , see sect .  3 ) and",
    "the radiative time - scales are much larger than the age of the remnant .",
    "we performed the calculations in a 2-d cylindrical coordinate system @xmath1 using the flash code v2.5 ( fryxell et al .",
    "2000 ) , and including additional computational modules to handle the thermal conduction , the radiative losses , and the non - equilibrium of ionization ( nei ) effects ( see orlando et al .  2005 and",
    "reale & orlando 2008 for the details of their implementation ) .",
    "we assumed that the fluid is fully ionized , and can be regarded as a perfect gas ( with a ratio of specific heats @xmath2 ) .",
    "we traced the ejecta material by considering a passive tracer initially set to 1 for pure ejecta , and 0 elsewhere .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : init ] shows the initial configuration of our model in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the setup was dictated by the results of the analysis of the x - ray and infrared observations of w49b ( shown , for comparison , in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : init ] ) .",
    "we started our simulation considering a spherical remnant with radius 0.5 pc . in agreement with miceli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the total mass of ejecta was set to 6 @xmath3 and the explosion energy to @xmath4 erg ( partitioned so that @xmath5 of the sn energy is kinetic energy ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the mass of ejecta derived from the observations is subject to some uncertainties , given , for instance , the uncertainty in converting emission measure to mass . in our model",
    ", a different mass of the ejecta implies a different velocity of the ejecta ( if keeping the explosion energy constant ) , thus influencing the energy of the shocks reflected by the clouds .",
    "this point may be important because , as shown below , the reflected shocks determine both the morphology and overionization pattern of the remnant .",
    "however , the ejecta velocity is @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the ejecta mass ) , so that we do not expect dramatic changes in our results if considering the uncertainty on the ejecta mass to be within a factor of 2 .",
    "the ambient medium in which the remnant expands is assumed to be inhomogeneous .",
    "in particular , we focused on the coaxial rings observed by keohane et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in 1.64 @xmath8 m [ fe ii ] , suggesting that w49b  is confined by ring - like enhanced density structures .",
    "these structures may originate from the bipolar wind of the massive progenitor star as indicated by keohane et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , still , there are another two possibilities : the protostellar disk that had been evaporated by the ionizing radiation of the progenitor ( mccray & lin 1994 ) , or the accumulated material in the orbiting plane in a binary system",
    ". these coaxial rings are also visible in the radio continuum band ( lacey et al .",
    "2001 ) and may also be the origin of the x - ray emission in the remnant ( miceli et al .  2006 ; keohane et al .",
    "according to this barrel - shaped structure , a dense ring surrounding the remnant ( 2 pc away from the central axis ) was set up in our model ( its section in the @xmath1 plane is shown in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "f : init ] as a vertical bar ) .",
    "we fixed its density to 1600 @xmath9 in agreement with the results of keohane et al .",
    "in addition , we accounted for the molecular h@xmath10 cloud observed in the eastern region of the remnant , by modeling a dense wall ( density @xmath11 @xmath9 , keohane et al.2007 ; see horizontal bar in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f : init ] ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the density values used in our model are those constrained by observations and may be affected by some uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless we do not expect any change in our results as long as these density values remain few orders of magnitude higher then the intercloud medium .",
    "in such a case , the clouds act as walls , leading to strong reflected shocks .",
    "the tenuous intercloud medium was assumed to be isothermal ( @xmath12 k ) and homogeneous ( density @xmath13 ) .",
    "both the dense ring and the molecular cloud are assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with the intercloud medium .",
    "note that our model is aimed at reproducing the centrally - peaked morphology of the remnant and its pattern of overionization .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath14 pc . at the coarsest resolution ,",
    "the adaptive mesh algorithm ( paramesh ; macneice et al .",
    "2000 ) included in the flash code uniformly covers the 2d computational domain with a mesh of @xmath15 blocks , each with @xmath16 cells . at the beginning of the simulation we allowed for 7 additional nested levels of refinement with resolution increasing twice at each refinement level . during the remnant evolution ,",
    "the number of nested levels progressively decreased down to 5 at the end of the simulation .",
    "this grid configuration yields an effective resolution at the finest level of @xmath17 pc at the beginning and 0.012 pc at the end of the simulation . reflecting boundary conditions were used at @xmath18 pc , consistently with the adopted symmetry",

    "[ f : dentemp ] ) . after the interaction of the forward shock with",
    "the dense ring and the eastern dense cloud , reflected shocks develop and move backwards to the center of the remnant .",

    "[ f : dentemp ] ) , the ejecta heated by the reflected shock also rapidly cool down due to their rapid adiabatic expansion . the lower panel in fig .  [",

    "the results are the same .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the energy losses are dominated by transport by thermal conduction at all critical evolutionary phases , and the radiative scales are much larger than the age of the remnant .",
    "the low conduction timescale are due to the large temperature contrast between shocked csm / mc material and the inner part of the remnant , which was not considered in the ic 443 by yamaguchi et al .",

    "the reflected shock from the dense ring concentrates to the center of the remnant , squeezing the ejecta there , and forming a jet - like feature with dense and hot material .",
    "we verified ( with the help of an additional simulation with the same setup of that presented here but neglecting the effects of thermal conduction ) that , if the thermal conduction is not included in the simulation , the ejecta are distributed over a widespread region and are not pushed backwards to the center of the remnant ; as a consequence if it were not for the thermal conduction , the central jet - like feature would be too tenuous to be distinguished . at @xmath24 yr",

    "the central `` jet '' region and the eastern `` shell '' region are hot enough to emit x - rays , and their surface brightness is expected to be high because of their high density and enhanced abundances . at this stage of evolution , therefore , our hydrodynamic model naturally reproduces the central jet - like feature and the eastern bright shell observed in x - rays with _ xmm - newton _ and @xmath28 ( miceli et al .",

    "in fact , high values of @xmath36 qualitatively corresponds to regions where the rrc edge has the highest probability of being observed .",

    "we adopted the ejecta tracer as a factor to evaluate the real fe abundance in the computational cells where ejecta and ism are mixed together .",
    "we found that different choices of the abundance of pure ejecta have only secondary effects on @xmath36 .",

    "we modeled the evolution of w49b taking into account , for the first time , the mixing of ejecta with the inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium , the thermal conduction , the radiative losses from optically thin plasma , and the deviations from equilibrium of ionization induced by the dynamics .",
    "our model is suited to address the still pending issue of the origin of overionized plasma in w49b whose direct detection has been recently reported .",

    "we found that the thermal conduction plays an important role in the evolution of the system , since it induces the evaporation of a non - negligible fraction of the cold and dense cloud material that mixes with the hot surrounding shocked medium , and promotes the formation of the characteristic central bright feature of this mixed morphology remnant ( see fig .",
    "[ f : dentemp ] ) .",

    "2010 ) ; our simulation may also provide a similar ( but qualitative ) explanation for the structures in 3c397 .",
    "our model predicts that overionization originates in the remnant due to the rapid cooling of the hot plasma originally heated by the shock reflected from the dense ring toward the center of the remnant .",
    "we found two different classes of overionized plasma : one consists of shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) , the other of a mixture of shocked ism and ejecta material .",
    "these two classes are associated with different cooling processes , respectively : i ) the mixing of hot shocked plasma with the cooler dense material evaporated from the ring . and ii ) the rapid adiabatic expansion of plasma . in particular , the overionization of the ejecta ( observed in x - rays ) is due to their rapid free expansion that follows their early heating .    in this paper",
    "we adopted the simplest configuration of the initial sn explosion , by considering a spherical symmetry . nevertheless , this simple configuration together with the inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium reproduce the morphology and overionization pattern of the remnant quite naturally .",
    "our model suggests that the bipolar morphology of w49b ( e.g. its jet - like feature ) could be an hydrodynamic effect originating from the interaction of shocks reflected by the surrounding clouds .",
    "the model indicates that the plasma in the remnant is in nei , and it could explain the unexpected fe abundances found by lopez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in terms of overionization of the ejecta .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our analysis does not rule out the possibility of a bipolar explosion in origin .",
    "this alternative scenario deserve a further investigation in a forthcoming paper .    on the basis of the morphology and conditions of overionization , we derived @xmath24 yr as a good estimate for the age of w49b .",
    "our model shows that at this evolutionary stage , there is more overionized plasma in the region where the ejecta expansion is not hampered .",
    "the strength of the rrc of [ fe xxvi ] and its spatial distribution are consistent with the x - ray observations .",
    "our findings support , therefore , the new idea that surrounding molecular clouds could be necessary ingredients to reproduce the peculiar morphology , ionization conditions , and abundance patterns of mm snrs .",

    "<S> w49b is a mixed - morphology supernova remnant with thermal x - ray emission dominated by the ejecta . in this remnant </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of overionized plasma has been directly established , with information about its spatial structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical origin of the overionized plasma in w49b has not yet been understood . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this intriguing issue through a 2d hydrodynamic model that takes into account , for the first time , the mixing of ejecta with the inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium , the thermal conduction , the radiative losses from optically thin plasma , and the deviations from equilibrium of ionization induced by plasma dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the model was set up on the basis of the observational results . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the thermal conduction plays an important role in the evolution of w49b , inducing the evaporation of the circumstellar ring - like cloud ( whose presence has been deduced from previous observations ) that mingles with the surrounding hot medium , cooling down the shocked plasma , and pushes the ejecta backwards to the center of the remnant , forming there a jet - like structure . during the evolution , a large region of overionized plasma forms within the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> the overionized plasma originates from the rapid cooling of the hot plasma originally heated by the shock reflected from the dense ring - like cloud . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we found two different ways for the rapid cooling of plasma to appear : i ) the mixing of relatively cold and dense material evaporated from the ring with the hot shocked plasma and ii ) the rapid adiabatic expansion of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of the radiative recombination continuum predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with that observed .    </S>",
