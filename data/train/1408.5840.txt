    "strongly coupled or strongly correlated systems are abundant in many fields of physics . in plasma physics , they have come into the focus in recent times due to the increasing availability of experimental realizations . in these experiments ,",

    "this leads to the emergence of complex phenomena such as shear waves  @xcite , solidification  @xcite , cooperative behavior  @xcite and anomalous transport  @xcite .",
    "because of these rich physics , there is strong aspiration to reach ever stronger degrees of correlation in the experiments .",
    "however , despite the central role of the coupling strength , it is often difficult to assess from experimental data as it requires detailed knowledge about the system state .",
    "in addition , the role of debye - screened interaction is often neglected when statements about the coupling strength are made .",
    "this leads to difficulties in comparing the degree of correlation across experiments which include dusty plasmas  @xcite , ultracold neutral plasmas  @xcite , ions in traps  @xcite , and warm dense matter setups .",
    "the situation is even more complex in a system containing multiple species such as two - component plasmas . here , in principle",
    ", one has to distinguish the coupling strength of the two components as well as the inter - species coupling . in high density plasmas , such as warm dense matter , where the light component ( i.e. , the electrons ) may be quantum degenerate and",
    "weakly coupled , the heavy component may be classical and strongly coupled .",
    "in addition , partial ionization maybe relevant making the analysis of structural and thermodynamic properties challenging .    in this work ,",
    "we give a structrual definition of the coupling strengths in nonideal plasmas , focusing exclusively on one - component plasmas .",
    "there , the coupling strength is typically given in terms of a coupling parameter @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a measure of the typical nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "strong coupling is associated with @xmath5 .",
    "for coulomb systems with the interaction potential @xmath6 , the coupling takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the particle charge and @xmath9^{1/3}$ ] is the wigner - seitz radius , a measure of the nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "evaluation of @xmath0 for a given experimental situation thus requires the measuring of @xmath10 and @xmath8 separately ( alongside the density @xmath11 ) .",
    "the importance of the coupling parameter for a model one - component coulomb plasma ( ocp ) arise from the observation that its mean energy and all thermodynamic quantities do not depend on density and temperature separately but only via @xmath0 .    in yukawa systems ,",
    "the interaction potential takes the form @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is related to the inverse of the screening length @xmath13 by @xmath14 . in a classical plasma @xmath13 is given by the debye length whereas , in a strongly degenerate quantum plasma , it is given by the thomas - fermi screening length .",
    "in general , @xmath13 is defined by the static long - wavelength limit of the longitudinal polarization function , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it is customary to give the coupling strength of yukawa systems in terms of @xmath0 as per eq .   together with the inverse screening length @xmath1",
    "however , since @xmath15 is not the true measure of the potential energy of a yukawa system ( due to the missing screening  @xcite ) , @xmath0 carries no immediate physical significance for these systems .",
    "this raises the question of how to compare yukawa and coulomb systems on the one hand and yukawa systems of different screening on the other .",
    "we thus face two intricacies when using @xmath0 as a measure of the coupling strength : 1 ) it requires the measurement of @xmath8 and @xmath10 separately , and 2 ) it is only physically meaningful for coulomb systems .",
    "the goal of this work is to alleviate these problems by finding a one - to - one mapping between the structure of coulomb and yukawa systems to  @xmath0 [ eq .  ] .",
    "this allows one to infer @xmath0 from the structure alone , i.e. , without knowledge of @xmath8 or @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , by using structural features to define the coupling strength , it is possible to give an effective coupling parameter @xmath16for yukawa systems  @xcite . for a yukawa system with a given screening length ,",
    "this parameters equals the value of @xmath0 of the corresponding coulomb system with the most similar structure , i.e. , the most meaningful comparison system . a similar approach as been used in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the path taken here towards this goal is the following : using langevin dynamics simulation , we obtain reference data for the structure of coulomb and yukawa systems in the form of the radial pair distribution function ( rpdf ) @xmath17 .",
    "to uniquely relate the shape of this function to the physical degree of non - ideality we use two of its properties : the width of the correlation hole and the height of the first peak of @xmath17 .",
    "comparing these experimentally accessible quantities to the reference data allows one to infer @xmath0 .",
    "carefully optimized fit formulas are derived which connect the structure to the coupling strength and allow for an interpolation to values not covered in the reference data .    .",
    "[ fig : gofr_visual ] ]",
    "we use langevin dynamics simulation for @xmath18 particles to obtain the equilibrium properties of the coulomb and yukawa one - component plasma .",
    "the langevin equation reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the friction coefficient , @xmath21 is the repulsive interaction force between the particles and @xmath22 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and the standard deviation @xmath23 [ @xmath24 .",
    "we use a constant friction coefficient of @xmath25 , where @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] is the nominal ( coulomb ) plasma frequency .",
    "we vary @xmath1 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 in steps of @xmath29 and vary @xmath0 to cover the entire liquid phase ( i.e. , from @xmath30 up to close to the phase transition temperature ) .",
    "to assess the structural state of the system , we use the radial pair distribution defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the averaging is over time .",
    "the rpdf is the most simple structural quantity of a many - particle system and describes the relative occurrence frequency of a particular pair distance @xmath33 in the system . in many setups ,",

    "there are also various theoretical approaches to calculate the rpdf including the hypernetted chain approach  @xcite and simulations  @xcite .    for a system of non - interacting particles , @xmath34 and",
    "any correlation effects will manifest themselves in deviation of @xmath17 from unity",
    ". one of the two main rpdf characteristics of strongly coupled systems is the correlation void at small values of @xmath33 which reflects the mutual repulsion of particles at small distances .",

    "neighbors around any particular particle .    and @xmath35as a function of @xmath0 for a coulomb system . note that in the left part of the figure , the @xmath0-axis is scaled logarithmically .",
    "[ fig : gmaxr05 ] ]    the build - up of correlation from an uncorrelated system manifests itself in two subsequent steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gofr_visual ] ) : first , the correlation void grows rapidly as the correlation increases .",
    "after this process , upon further increase of the coupling strength , the shell structure emerges and becomes gradually more pronounced .",
    "notably , the size increase of the correlation void with the coupling strength is rapid only at small values of the coupling , while the growth of the peak structure is most prominent at larger coupling values .",
    "this complementary development leads us to use both features of the rpdf in our subsequent analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gofr_visual ] ) .",
    "specifically , we assess the size of the correlation void as the value of @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 i.e. , the dimensionless distance at which @xmath17 has risen to half its asymptotic limit . for the peak structure ,",
    "we use the height of the first peak in the rpdf , i.e. , its global maximum @xmath38  .    as an example",

    "however , since both @xmath35and @xmath38are strictly monotonic functions of @xmath0 at given @xmath1 , they both uniquely define the whole structural composition of the system and thus the complete thermodynamic equilibrium properties of the plasma .",
    "the switching between @xmath35and @xmath38to define the coupling strength is thus only a matter of practicality .",
    "we now establish a one - to - one mapping between the structure of a system and its physical coupling strength . in doing so",
    ", we assume that the screening length @xmath1 is known in a given experimental setup .",
    "this is crucial , because in this first step , we express the coupling of a yukawa system in the customary way through the nominal coulomb coupling parameter @xmath0 . since this is not the actual physical coupling strength of a yukawa system , systems with the same value of @xmath0 but different @xmath1 exhibit different degrees of structural correlation .",
    "conversely , a given structure can correspond to a multitude of @xmath39 pairs , so that without knowledge of @xmath1 , these systems can not be distinguished . if , however , @xmath1 is known , then the structure [ i.e. the shape of @xmath17 ] uniquely defines the coupling value @xmath0 .            first , we consider systems whose correlation is large enough that a peak structure has formed and the first peak in the rpdf is clearly visible ( trivially , @xmath38tends to unity when the coupling strength is lowered ) .",

    "this is a reflection of the fact that in systems with large values of @xmath1 , the increased screening reduces the interaction between the particles . to use @xmath38as a reliable indicator of @xmath0 , the dependence @xmath41 must be sensitive to a variation of @xmath38",
