    "in the last decade , it has been found that an external ac field ( microwaves - mw s ) causes the appearance of microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro s ) @xcite which evolve into zero - resistance states ( zrs ) for high - quality two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "miro s and zrs occur in dissipative resistance but are not accompanied by plateaus in hall resistance as for the integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "miro periodicity is governed by the ratio of radiation frequency @xmath2 to cyclotron frequency @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the effective mass of the electrons . in theory , it is currently assumed that these oscillating phenomena can be explained by mechanisms originating from the scattering - assisted electron transitions between different landau levels ( lls ) in the presence of microwave excitation .",
    "the two main competing microscopic mechanisms for oscillating photoresistance are the  displacement \" mechanism which accounts for spatial displacement of electrons along the applied dc field under scattering - assisted microwave absorption @xcite , and the  inelastic \" mechanism , owing to an oscillatory contribution to the isotropic part of the electron distribution function @xcite .",
    "such a consideration describes the periodicity and phase of miro s observed in experiments .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that mw - induced phenomena in 2des are not restricted to single - layer 2des .",
    "microwave - induced resistance oscillations have been found in bilayer and trilayer systems @xcite , and high - mobility bilayers with two occupied 2d subbands exhibit zrs @xcite .",
    "the specific features in magnetoresistance in bilayers and multilayers are caused by an interference of magneto - intersubband ( mis ) oscillations @xcite with miro s , when mw irradiation enhances , suppresses , or inverses the mis oscillations .",
    "apart from dissipative resistance , one can ask if and how mw irradiation does affect hall resistance since it was first a surprise , see mani _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , that hall effect seemed to be unaffected by microwaves .",
    "subsequent experiments on high - quality single - layer 2des have shown weak mw - induced oscillations in hall resistance @xcite . the mw - induced hall resistance @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dark hall resistance , depends on mw power and follows @xmath7-periodicity of photoresponse in dissipative resistance .",
    "the observed _ odd symmetry _ under field reversal , @xmath8 , is preserved under increasing mw power .",
    "the studies in refs . @xcite have revealed basic information about mw - induced hall resistance , though the role of microscopic mechanisms still remains unclear .",
    "theoreticians , however , have started to work on mw - induced hall resistance , suggesting several microscopic mechanisms that describe how @xmath0 is affected by an ac field @xcite .",
    "dissipative resistivity @xmath9 , whose change at low temperatures is governed mostly by the inelastic mechanism @xcite , remains an even function under magnetic field reversal .",
    "in contrast , the mechanisms responsible for hall resistivity lead to both odd- and even - symmetry contributions in @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of even - symmetry terms was discussed @xcite in connection with the important question of violation of onsager - casimir relations @xcite . indeed ,",
    "since mw - excited electron systems are far from thermodynamic equilibrium conditions , it is quite possible that the symmetry of the resistivity tensor is essentially broken under mw irradiation .",
    "further experimental investigations of mw - induced hall resistance are desirable to gain more knowledge about mechanisms of mw photoresistance and related symmetry properties of resistivity .    in this work ,",
    "we have carried out measurements of mw - induced hall resistance in high - mobility bilayers formed in wide quantum wells ( wqw s ) with high electron density . due to charge redistribution in wqw ,",
    "there are two layers near the interfaces , separated by an electrostatic potential barrier , which creates a symmetric tunnel - coupled bilayer electron system with two populated 2d subbands closely spaced in energy @xcite . despite a complex photoresponse in bilayer systems , the smaller period of mis oscillations @xcite compared to the miro period",
    "permits us a direct visualization of the quantum component of magnetoresistance that is affected by microwaves .",
    "this fact might be considered as an experimental advantage compared to a 2des with only one occupied subband @xcite .",
    "we show @xmath1 and @xmath0 for both directions of the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath10 and demonstrate that mw - induced hall resistance exhibits an mis / miro interference with a strong deviation from odd symmetry under field reversal .",

    ", we found a violation of odd symmetry in mw - induced hall resistance , in contrast to previous experiments @xcite on single - layer 2des with higher mobilities .",
    "a non - trivial power dependence is observed for several mis oscillation peaks in @xmath0 .",
    "symmetry of @xmath0 is also essentially modified by changing mw power .",
    "varying @xmath0 for different orientations of linear polarization strongly confirms the feasibilitly of polarization - dependent microscopic mechanisms of mw - induced hall resistance , in contrast to polarization immunity in dissipative resistance @xcite .",
    "the photoresponse in @xmath0 might be accounted for by the presence of two components in @xmath0 , of which one is odd and another is even with respect to magnetic field reversal .",
    "a reasonably good estimate for the magnitude of @xmath0 is obtained within the bulk transport approach . however , bulk transport models , as well as currently existing alternative approaches to the problem of mw - induced resistance , fail to explain non - trivial power and polarization dependence and the strong violation of odd symmetry observed in our experiments .",
    "due to the essential deviation of our data from the theoretical models discussed above , we can not preclude the influence of possible previously unconsidered microscopic mechanisms that might exist in a broad interval of mw power or turn on at elevated mw power .    in general , our data and its analysis suggest that the problem of mw - induced hall resistance ( and , hence , the related problem of mw - induced dissipative resistance ) still remains a puzzle that awaits a future solution .",
    "we suppose that a theory that could describe the behavior of both components of the mw - induced resistivity on an equal footing and explain the variety of experimental facts has to be based on a consideration of quantum transport in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous mw field .",
    "we assume that our systematic study will stimulate further experimental and theoretical investigations , which are crucial to clarify the origin of mw - induced phenomena in 2des .",
