    "several models of such a type have been considered in @xcite . the decisive advantage of using the energy @xmath36 compared to other elastic energies stems from the fact that computational implementations of elasto - plasticity @xcite based on the additive decomposition @xmath46 in infinitesimal models @xcite , can be used with nearly no changes also in isotropic finite strain problems @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the multiplicative plasticity models preserve ellipticity in purely elastic processes at frozen plastic variables provided that the initial elastic response is elliptic .",
    "preservation of lh - ellipticity is , in our view , a property which should be satisfied by any hyperelastic - plastic model since the elastically unloaded material specimen should respond reasonable under further purely elastic loading .",

    "an interesting question concerns the requirements that one should impose on the elastic response for arbitrary large distortional strains .",
    "one may reasonably argue that these requirements are void of any relevance , since the material can never be observed in a state of large distortional strain : prior to that , dissipative processes will occur . in the case of the energy @xmath17 , which is not rank - one elliptic for extreme distortional strains , we have explicitly shown that elastic unloading will remain rank - one convex and the true - stress - true - strain relation remains monotone .",
