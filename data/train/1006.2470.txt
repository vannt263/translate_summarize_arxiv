    "cosmic shear measurements are a potentially powerful probe of structure growth at intermediate to late epochs of the cosmic history .",

    "cosmic - shear measurements are the primary motivation for several dedicated surveys that are proposed or upcoming ( e.g. euclid , jdem , des , lsst ) .",
    "they will greatly increase the survey area and the number of observed galaxies , and hence lower the statistical uncertainty of the shear estimates .",
    "however , the analysis of synthetic data in the great08 challenge @xcite shows that the accuracy of shear estimation methods is currently not sufficient to fully exploit the next - generation surveys @xcite .    particularly concerning are systematic biases in shear estimates , which do not vanish when averaged over a large ensemble of lensed galaxies .",
    "these biases often stem from assumptions made in the derivation or implementation of shear estimation methods , which do not hold in reality .",
    "for instance , the models used to describe the galactic shape may systematically differ from the true shape @xcite .",
    "model - independent approaches may therefore be favored as they are not limited by the peculiarities of an underlying model .",
    "the widely employed ksb method @xcite is model - independent because it expresses the lensing - induced shape change by combinations of moments of the galactic light distribution .",
    "however , it relies on several assumptions regarding ( 1 ) the strength of the apparent distortion , ( 2 ) the width of the window function , ( 3 ) the mapping between convolved and unconvolved ellipticity , and ( 4 ) the ellipticity of the psf .",
    "it has been noted that the accuracy of the ksb method has a problematic dependence on items ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the reasons for problems encountered with shear estimates from ksb by a rederivation of its fundamental relations .",

    ", we briefly review the basic relations of gravitational lensing and show how to construct a shear estimate from observed image ellipticities . in sect .  3 ,",
    "we introduce and test three variants of ksb based on a linearized relation between shear and ellipticity , and a novel one which employs a third - order relation .",

    "combinations of second moments are used to quantify the image s ellipticity , which we introduce as @xmath20 the complex ellipticity @xmath21 is related to the reduced shear @xmath22 by @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is the unlensed ( intrinsic ) ellipticity .",
    "this relation holds as long as the lens mapping can be locally linearised .",
    "information on the intrinsic ellipticity of a single object is not accessible .",
    "reasonable shear estimates thus require averaging over many galaxies in a region where @xmath22 can be considered constant , assuming that the average of @xmath25 vanishes , @xmath26 if the coordinate frame is rotated such that only one shear component does not vanish , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gavetot ] ) is solved by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the standard deviation of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution . in the derivation of the equation above we neglected higher order moments of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution .",
    "note that the average ellipticity appears in this equation , and that the relation between the average ellipticity and the shear is generally non - linear .",
    "we recall here that other ellipticity estimators can be defined in addition to the one presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellipticity ] ) .",
    "another common estimator is @xmath29 which has a perfect response to shear , i.e. the shear responsivity is 1 @xcite .",
    "however this estimator is considered more noisy and therefore not commonly used in weak - lensing measurements , and in particular it is not used by ksb . for this reason we will employ @xmath21 as ellipticity estimator rather than @xmath30 throughout this work",
    "in practice , shear estimates are obtained from small and noisy background galaxies .",
    "the observed shape of any object is the result of a convolution of its intrinsic surface brightness @xmath31 with the point spread function @xmath32 .",
    "the convolution tends to make the object more circular or to imprint a spurious ellipticity on it if the psf is not isotropic .",
    "moreover , any measurement of moments has to incorporate a weight function in order to suppress the pixel noise dominating at large spatial scales .",
    "convolution and weighting change the surface brightness to @xmath33 since we are interested in the object s unconvolved and unweighted shape , we need to correct these two effects . in this section ,",
    "we first assume @xmath34 , i.e.  we neglect the psf convolution , and postpone the psf correction to the following section .",
    "we review in this section the standard ksb formalism , neglecting psf convolution .",
    "in this situation the only complication is given by the presence of the weighting function for the computation of moments , which modifies the relation between shear and ellipticity given by eq .",

    "this relation is @xmath50 @xcite with @xmath51 and @xmath52 the notation we use here follows @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ psh ] ) directly relates the measured weighted ellipticity @xmath21 to the shear @xmath22 if the intrinsic ellipticity of the source @xmath24 is known .",
    "since @xmath21 and @xmath24 can not be disentangled for individual galaxies , averages over ensembles of images are necessary to estimate @xmath22 , @xmath53 however , the quantity which is commonly computed is @xmath54 @xcite , assuming that @xmath55 .",

    "the true shear @xmath22 is then sought by averaging @xmath59 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : chi_g ] ) shows that for @xmath58 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 is related to @xmath21 by @xmath62 in general , @xmath61 differs from the true shear @xmath22 computed in eq .",

    "moreover , averaging shear estimates does not allow one to assume that @xmath59 is small , as done in the original derivation of @xmath56 , since it is always of the same magnitude as @xmath21",

    "the reason for this bias comes from the fact that second- or higher - order terms in @xmath22 have been neglected in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ psh ] ) , while terms like @xmath73 have been kept .",
    "once @xmath22 is identified with @xmath59 , these mixed terms are effectively of the same order as the @xmath74 terms . in a consistent first - order relation between @xmath21 and @xmath59 , only the first - order term in @xmath75 can be considered .",
    "then , @xmath76 looks like @xmath77 we shall refer to this approximation as ksb1 . in this case",
    ", the solution for @xmath59 is @xmath78 the error on the shear estimate made by ksb1 scales like @xmath79 , leading to an underestimate which is considerably smaller than the overestimate given by ksb .",

    ", @xmath76 is approximated by half its trace ( ksbtr hereafter ) , @xmath80 this is usually justified saying that the trace is less noisy than the inverse of the full tensor , as we shall show in sect .  3.3 .",
    "this statement is certainly correct for large ellipticities .",
    "however , it turns out to work much better than the full tensor even in the absence of noise , psf and weighting .",
    "the reason is that it leads to the relation @xmath81 between @xmath59 and @xmath21 , which biases the shear estimate by @xmath82 .",
    "we can summarise the preceding discussion as follows :    1 .",
    "ksb incorrectly approximates eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_g ] ) ; 2 .",
    "ksb1 is mathematically consistent ; 3 .",
    "ksbtr approximates eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_g ] ) better even though it lacks mathematical justification ; 4 .",
    "no ksb variant discussed so far is correct to third order in @xmath21 .",
    "we now derive a consistent third - order relation between @xmath21 and @xmath59 , including the effects of the weight function .",
    "we follow closely the approach in sect .",
    "4.6.2 of @xcite , and use einstein s sum convention .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chisource ] ) and taylor - expand the weight function around @xmath83 to third order in @xmath22 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 was used .",
    "note that the derivatives of the weight function are taken with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "truncating the series at a given order implies that the final result will depend on the shape of the weight function .",
    "we proceed with the calculation of @xmath87 to third order in @xmath75 , @xmath88 where the definitions @xmath89 appear .",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 are given in eq .",
    "[ eq : defbl ] . in the same way",

    "moreover , sixth - order moments of the observed surface - brightness distribution appear in @xmath100 and eigth - order moments in @xmath101 because of the taylor expansion of the weight function to third order .",
    "we discuss in the following section how to deal with the non - linear relation between shear and ellipticity and possible noise issues due to the appearance of higher moments .      we now show the results of simple tests carried out to check how well the four variants of ksb estimate the shear .",
    "we consider a circular source ( @xmath58 ) with a srsic brightness profile , @xmath102\\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the radius containing half of the flux and @xmath104 the srsic index and @xmath105 is a constant which depends on @xmath104 .",
    "this type of profile is identical to a gaussian for @xmath106 and is steeper in the centre for @xmath107 . in the following test , we assume @xmath108 , which represents the average value for rather bright galaxies in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "we shear this profile by a variable amount @xmath109 , keeping @xmath110 fixed , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordtransf ] ) .",
    "for all following tests , the effective galaxy radius was @xmath111 pixels , the srsic model was tenfold oversampled , and the image sidelength was set such as to not truncate the galaxy at the image boundary .",
    "then , we measure the ellipticity as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellipticity ] ) .",
    "since the model galaxy is intrinsically circular , the source ellipticity is entirely generated by the applied shear which is varied in a wide range such as to mimic the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion .",
    "the weight function has been chosen as gaussian with @xmath112 .",
    "we repeated this test assuming a flat weight function ( @xmath60 ) in order to estimate how much the different approximations in deriving @xmath56 affect the measurement .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nolin ] .    in absence of a weight function ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nolin ] ) , the performance of the four variants closely follows the analytic behaviour worked out in sects .",
    "3.1 and 3.2 : ksb severely overestimates the shear for large @xmath109 , while ksbtr and ksb1 better approximate the shear .",
    "ksb3 returns the correct shear under this condition .",
    "the weight function renders the image more circular and thus reduces the measured @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the high - order terms in @xmath21 contribute less to the shear estimate .",
    "therefore , the deviation from the correct result is significantly lower for all the methods ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nolin ] ) .",
    "this is not true for ksb1 , which allows only a first - order correction for the weight function .",
    "we also investigate the behaviour of the four ksb variants for realistic pixel noise .",
    "the average result for 100 galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] .",
    "ksbtr is the only method for which no matrix inversion is required .",
    "it is thus not surprising that it exhibits the lowest standard deviation for all values of @xmath59 .",
    "ksb and ksb3 have a comparable amount of noise even though ksb3 involves the computation of 6th and 8th moments of the light distribution .",
    "the reason is that these higher - order moments are computed using the second and third derivatives of the weight function .",
    "there is no price to be payed ( in terms of measurement noise ) in using ksb3 instead of the simple ksb description .",
    "we also investigate how much the measurement of one component of the shear is affected by the value of the other component . for this case",
    ", we also studied the case of unweighted and weighted moment measurements . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crosstalk ] .",
    "the obvious cross - talk between the two components is not surprising for ksb , ksbtr or ksb1 since all terms which mix @xmath109 and @xmath113 were neglected in the calculation . introducing third - order corrections ,",
    "the estimate of one shear component becomes almost independent of the other component .",
    "finally , we study how much the bias in the shear measurement depends on the width @xmath114 of the weight function @xmath115 .",
    "we vary the width within @xmath116 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weightsize ] . ksb and ksb1 exhibit a strong dependence on @xmath114 , while ksbtr is more robust , and ksb3 is almost independent of @xmath114 . due to the poor correction of the weight - induced change of @xmath21",
    ", ksb1 performs poorest in this test . for ksb , the reduction of @xmath21 due to the weighting limits its strong non - linear response such that the bias decreases for narrow weight functions .",
    "as ksb3 employs the best description of the weighting , it performs excellently in this test .    in all tests carried out so far ,",
    "we have assumed that the intrinsic ellipticity of the object vanishes , @xmath117 .",
    "this is of course idealised since galaxies have an intrinsic ellipticity dispersion . in order to test the performance of the four methods for an isotropic source - ellipticity distribution , we apply the so - called _ ring test _ @xcite .",
    "we construct an ensemble of test galaxies falling on a circle in the ellipticity plane , shear them , measure their shapes , and take the mean .",
    "we choose an intrinsic ellipticity @xmath118 and apply the shear @xmath119 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ringtest ] .",
    "a perfect method would recover the correct shear after averaging over all test galaxies .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that ksb is unable to recover the correct shear from the averaged individual shear estimates since they depend non - linearly on @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to an average overestimate of @xmath120 if the shear is aligned with the intrinsic ellipticity . as the other variants have lower non - linear error in the @xmath21-@xmath22 relation , the mean values are biased by @xmath121 ( ksb1 ) , @xmath122 ( ksbtr ) and @xmath123 ( ksb3 )",
    "any measured galaxy s ellipticity is the result of three distinct physical processes : intrinsic ellipticity , lensing , and psf convolution . as discussed above ,",
    "lensing maps the galaxy s light distribution from the source to the lens plane , distorting its shape .",
    "the relation between galaxy ellipticity and shear can be found solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_g ] ) if there is no weight function , or eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_sh ] ) if weighted moments are used to define the ellipticity . in general ,",
    "the equation one needs to solve to relate ellipticity to a shear estimator @xmath59 has the implicit form @xmath124 on the other hand , psf deconvolution maps the observed ellipticity from the image plane ( on which the object is lensed and convolved with the psf ) to the lens plane ( on which the object is lensed only ) @xmath125 thus , the relation between observed ellipticity and the shear estimator in presence of psf convolution is the solution of @xmath126\\;.\\label{eq : okmapping}\\ ] ]    if the psf is perfectly circular , the only effect of @xmath127 is a circularisation of the object , otherwise the psf induces additional anisotropic distortions .",

    "this means that within the ksb framework it is not possible to correct properly for highly elliptical psfs .",
    "if the determination of @xmath168 is wrong , so is the estimate of @xmath177 ( the ellipticity of @xmath176 ) , and the error will propagate to the final shear measurement in an almost unpredictable way @xcite .",
    "this could happen if the anisotropy of the psf is too large for a linear treatment , or if the psf can not be decomposed into an isotropic and an anisotropic part .",
    "we perform the same tests as in the previous section , but with an additional convolution with a moffat - shaped psf , @xmath178 where @xmath179 controls the size of the psf and @xmath180 regulates its steepness . in order to ensure vanishing flux at large radii",
    ", the psf is truncated at @xmath181  fwhm , and the appropriate value at that position is subtracted from @xmath182 .",
    "we begin studying the case of a flat weight function , @xmath60 , for which we derive the behaviour of the four ksb variants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gchia ] ) . the key quantity for describing a spherical psf",
    "is given by @xmath183 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) , which is a function mainly of the psf width and mildly of its steepness for a given galaxy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : apsf ] ) .",
    "we investigate the performance of the four methods as a function of the shear for a fixed psf width .",
    "we choose @xmath184 and @xmath185 to mimic a space - based observation , and @xmath186 and @xmath187 to mimic a ground - based observation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_nowin ] . in the first case",
    ", ksb3 gives the best result , while ksbtr is the best approximation in the second case , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) .",
    "we next investigate the response of the four methods to the size of the psf for a given @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_size ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath188 and @xmath189 . as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bias ] ) , ksb , ksbtr and ksb1 have the same limit for large psf ( @xmath190 ) , while the bias for ksb3 is the largest in the limit of a very wide psf . as noted before , the psf correction in all ksb variants introduces a negative bias which partly compensates ( or even overcompensates ) the overestimate by ksb and ksbtr from the lens mapping .",
    "since ksb3 is essentially unbiased for unconvolved ellipticities , any psf correction necessarily lowers the shear estimate .",
    "finally , we introduce the weight function into the moment measurement and study the response of the four methods in this situation .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_win ] for a space - based ( left panel ) and a ground - based observation ( right panel ) .",
    "for narrow psfs , the methods react on weighting as in the previous section , where the psf was neglected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : weightsize ] ) , while the response is milder for a wider psf . for a narrow psf , ksbtr and ksb3",
    "are essentially unbiased , and ksbtr remains fairly unbiased when the psf width increases . from the comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : psf_nowin ] and [ fig : psf_win ] we can infer the effect of weighting on the shear estimates .",
    "the biases of most methods are lowered because the ellipticity of the convolved source is lower , hence a circular weight function does not significantly affect the ellipticity measurement .",
    "however , in particular ksb1 shows concerning dependence on both the presence of a weighting function and the width of the psf : even though ksb1 seems fairly unbiased in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : psf_win ] , other values of the width of the weight function would lead to less optimal results .",
    "we are aware that our tests are of somewhat approximate nature in the sense that the characteristics of the simulated images only coarsely resemble that of realistic survey data .",
    "the real - life performance of all ksb variants will depend on peculiar properties of the surveys to be analyzed , such as the shape of the psf , the depth of the observation , etc .",
    "however , two findings from our result can be considered robust : ksb3 shows the least amount of bias and the weakest dependence on the width of the weighting function , as long as the psf remains narrow with respect to the galaxy size .",
    "ksbtr has a more pronounced dependence on the weighting function , but reacts only weakly on changes of the psf width .",
    "we have assessed the assumptions underlying the ksb method for measuring gravitational shear from the images of ensembles of lensed galaxies .",
    "ksb has the great advantage of being model - independent since it expresses the lensing - induced shape change by a combination of moments of the surface - brightness distribution . however , several assumptions underlying the derivation of the method and its practical implementations turn out to be violated more or less severely in realistic situations .",
    "we can summarise our results as follows :    1 .   ksb defines a shear estimate for each individual galaxy , defined as the shear that would describe the observed ellipticity if the object was perfectly circular prior to lensing . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that the instrinsic ellipticity of the individual object vanishes .",
    "the true shear is then computed averaging these shear estimates within a region where @xmath22 is assumed to be constant .",
    "this is in general not equivalent to averaging the ellipticities of each individual object and then computing the true shear : averaging observed galaxy ellipticities and measuring the shear do not commute because not the individual intrinsic ellipticities can be assumed to vanish , but only their average .",
    "we show that the difference between the two approaches is a function of the variance of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution .",
    "the error introduced this way depends on the variants of ksb used , the size of the psf , and the width of the weight function .",
    "it is normally in the percent range .",
    "the definition of the ksb shear estimate relies on the assumption that the shear is small .",
    "however , this is only true after averaging . for a single object ,",
    "the reduced - shear estimate @xmath22 is of the same order as the ellipticity @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to a relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 which is correct only to first order .",
    "this situation can be improved considering only linear terms in @xmath75 in the derivation of @xmath56 ( ksb1 ) , or considering consistently terms up to third order in @xmath75 ( ksb3 ) .",
    "we also show that the approximation of @xmath56 by half of its trace ( ksbtr ) , although not mathematically justified , yields a better @xmath22-@xmath21 relation compared to ksb .",
    "ksb , ksb1 and ksbtr in absence of psf convolution tend to overestimate the shear , while ksb3 gives an almost perfect result .",
    "4 .   ksb and ksb1 depend strongly on the width of the weight function used in the moment measurements , while ksbtr is more robust and ksb3 is almost independent of it .",
    "5 .   ksb does not perform any psf deconvolution , but gives only an approximate correction for the effects of the psf .",
    "we show that this correction would be equivalent to a proper deconvolution from a circular psf only in the case of a circular source , otherwise the improper psf correction lowers the shear estimate . 6 .",
    "the overestimate due to the wrong relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 and the underestimate due to the inappropriate psf correction tend to compensate each other . for a narrow psf ( space - based observation ) , ksb3 is the variant with the least bias , while ksbtr is the best method for wider psfs ( ground - based observation ) .",
    "7 .   the choice of the width @xmath114 of the weight function could be utilized to reduce the measurement bias . in principle",
    ", @xmath114 can be tuned according to the size of the psf and to the galaxy ellipicities such that the shear estimate ends up to be almost unbiased . however , practically this is only feasible for the galaxy ensemble as a whole , whereas choosing @xmath114 such that shear estimates are unbiased for each individual galaxy is of similar difficulty as estimating the shear .",
    "ksb can correct only small anisotropies in the psf ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "it is not possible to extend the formalism to allow more precise corrections since that would imply the calculation of derivatives of the observed surface brightness , which is not feasible since @xmath175 is a noisy quantity .",
    "an improper correction of the psf anisotropy introduces a bias which propagates to the final measurement of the shear in an almost unpredictable way .",
