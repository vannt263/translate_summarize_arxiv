    "a random laser is a system formed by randomly distributed scatterers embedded in a host medium where either scatterer or host medium or both provide optical gain through stimulated emission @xcite .",
    "recent observations of random lasing in a wide variety of systems , like powders of semiconductor nanoparticles @xcite , organic dyes in strongly scattering media @xcite , organic films or nanofibers @xcite and ceramics @xcite , have triggered a rapidly growing interest . for reviews with comprehensive lists of references",
    "see @xcite .",
    "random lasers share some properties with conventional lasers , like threshold behavior @xcite , narrow spectral lines @xcite , or photon statistics @xcite , but also exhibit distinctly different properties like multidirectional emission .",
    "coherent feedback has unambiguously been demonstrated to be present in strongly disordered random lasers @xcite .",
    "it requires the light to be sufficiently confined in the random system .",
    "while spatially confined regions from which the laser emission takes place have been observed experimentally @xcite , the physical origin of coherent feedback , of localized quasimodes and the dependence of their size on the pump rate have remained controversial .",
    "the possible theoretical explanations range from preformed random microresonators @xcite to multiple random scattering ( diffusion ) @xcite , possibly enhanced by self - interference @xcite of waves and the resulting onset of anderson localization ( al ) @xcite .",
    "conversely , it is an interesting fundamental question how al of light , which has been understood@xcite as a consequence of self - interference , is influenced by the coherent , stimulated amplification in the lasing state .",
    "problem of the intensity distribution in a diffusive random laser has been attacked theoretically by phenomenolocical diffusion models @xcite and numerical calculations in one @xcite and two spatial dimensions @xcite . however",
    ", the experimentally observed decrease of the lasing spot size with increasing pump rate , has not been explained so far .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of the size of lasing spots in diffusive random lasers by an analytical transport theory .",
    "we begin the analysis in section 2 by an outline of the transport theory of light in a disordered medium with linear gain ( i.e. , constant - in - time amplification rate ) , including self - interference ( so - called cooperon ) contributions . by a phenomenological analysis",
    "we show that causality implies in the presence of linear gain a novel length scale which is to be identified by the average radius ( spot size ) of a lasing mode , @xmath0 . in section 3",
    "we extend the theory for a system with linear gain to a transport theory including non - linear gain due to stationary lasing above threshold . observing that a stationary lasing state is possible",
    "only if the amplification in the medium is compensated by loss at the surface of the system , we consider a model for a finite - size random laser with infinite extension in the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) plane , but finite , constant thickness in the @xmath3 direction , a geometry relevant for many experimental systems @xcite .",
    "coupling the diffusive transport theory to the rate equations of a four - level laser in the stationary state we derive an analytical expression for the intensity correlation length @xmath4 to be identified with the average lasing spot size , @xmath0 . due to the surface",
    "boundary conditions the spatial extention of a lasing spot in the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) plane obtains a z - dependent profile , @xmath5 .",
    "we also analyse its dependence on the pump rate .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section 4 . on the pump rate and on the depth of the mode along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the propagation of light is described by its wave equation . neglecting the polarization degree of freedom we consider in the following the scalar wave equation for the field @xmath6 .",
    "it reads , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the vacuum speed of light and @xmath9 an external current source .",
    "the dielectric constant is @xmath10 , where the dielectric contrast between the background , @xmath11 , and the scatterers , @xmath12 , has been defined as @xmath13 .",
    "the spatial arrangement of the scatterers is described through the function @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a localized shape function at random locations @xmath16 .",
    "linear gain ( absorption ) is described by a temporally constant , negative ( positive ) imaginary part of @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have developed a theory for light transport in disordered media with linear gain or absorption .",
    "it results in an energy - density correlation function @xmath17 , which describes how the energy density of the light field with frequency @xmath18 propagates diffusively between two points in space and time , ( @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the fourier transform of the energy - density correlation function @xmath21 is obtained as @xmath22 c_p^{2 } ) }   % % { \\omega + i q^2 d + i \\xi_a^{-2}d}\\ ,    \\frac{n_{p } }   { \\omega + i q^2 d + i \\xi_a^{-2}d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression for the coefficient @xmath23 is given explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is not relevant for the present purpose .",
    "the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ p_e ] ) exhibits the expected diffusion pole structure with the diffusion coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , in the case of a non - conserving medium , i.e. net absorption ( gain ) , there appears the ( purely imaginary ) term @xmath25 , which has a positive ( negative ) imaginary part and does not vanish in the hydrodynamic limit , @xmath26 .",
    "the self - consistent solution of the transport theory including self - interference of waves ( cooperon contributions ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) shows that in the presence of absorption or gain the diffusion coefficient @xmath24 can not vanish and is in general complex .",
    "hence , truly anderson localized modes do not exist in this case .    for the case of absorption ( @xmath27 )",
    "it is seen by fourier transforming eq .",
    "( [ p_e ] ) w.r.t .",

    "fourier transforming , on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ p_e ] ) w.r.t .",
    "space in the stationary limit ( @xmath30 ) shows that @xmath31 is the length scale over which the energy density of diffusive modes is correlated in the lossy medium .    for the case of linear gain ( @xmath32 )",
    "the wave equation predicts an unlimited growth of the field amplitude and , hence , of the energy density .",
    "this means that a stationary lasing state is not possible in this case and , therefore , the limit @xmath33 must strictly not be taken in eq .",
    "( [ p_e ] ) .",
    "such a behavior of linear gain is expected only during the exponential intensity growth shortly after the onset of lasing .",
    "a complete theory of random lasing must , therefore , take into account either the full temporal dynamics of the system , or in a stationary state additional surface loss effects must compesate for the gain in the medium ( see section 3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can extract a characteristic size of a stationary lasing spot from this theory by requiring that the stationary lasing state has been reached _ locally _",
    ", i.e. within a finite subvolume of the system : causality requires that the pole of @xmath34 , eq . ( [ p_e ] ) , as a function of @xmath35 resides in the lower complex @xmath35 half - plane . for @xmath32",
    "this is possible only if all the diffusive modes allowed inside a given lasing spot have a wavenumber @xmath36 .",
    "this , in turn , requires that the spot size is @xmath37 it is the characteristic , maximal size of a spatial region over which diffusive modes can be causally correlated in the stationary lasing state .",
    "we conjecture that , hence , this size is to be identified with the lasing spot size observed experimentally @xcite in diffusive random lasers .",
    "since according to the microscopic theory @xcite the growth rate @xmath38 is , for small linear gain , proportional to the avergage gain in the medium , @xmath39 , we predict the spot size to be inversely proportional to the gain .    more generally , despite the fact that the linear gain assumption is not suited to describe stationary lasing , it can be used to estimate the laser threshold , i.e. the critical pump rate for lasing . amazingly , this is a rather general remark .",
    "for example , in a simpler system of a single microsphere with gain , it has been shown @xcite , that the scattering coefficients calculated within linear response lose their causality just at the point where the sphere crosses its lasing threshold .",
    "applied to our random laser system , this means that the threshold for lasing within a spot of size @xmath0 is reached when the transport coefficient @xmath40 , determined by the pump rate via the microscopic transport theory refs .",
    "@xcite , reaches the value given by eq .",

    "[ fig_0 ] we show the numerical evaluation of the spot size @xmath47 as a function of increasing @xmath48 for typical parameters , as given in the figure caption . the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is a measure of external pumping , since the gain is given by the population inversion of the laser . therefore , larger pumping yields higher inversion and leads to a larger @xmath49 .",
    "the calculated spot size displays a qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite ( spot size vs. pump intensity / threshold intensity ) shown in the inset .",
    "as remarked in section ii , a stationary lasing state in a homogenaously pumped system is possible only if the system is finite , so that surface loss effects can compensate the gain in the medium . to avoid the causality problem ,",
    "we consider here a three - dimensional random laser model with a homogeneously pumped , active medium which extends infinitely in the ( x , y ) plane , but has a finite , constant thickness @xmath50 in the z direction .",
    "the laser - active material is described by the semi - classical laser rate equations , and the light intensity transport by a diffusion equation . in particular , the rate equations for a four - level laser are @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the population number densities of the corresponding electron level ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 is the total number of electrons participating in the lasing process , @xmath56 are the transition rates from level @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the non - radiative decay rate of the laser level 2 .",

    "since in the slab geometry ensemble - averaged quantities are translationally invariant in the ( @xmath69 ) plane , but not along the @xmath3 direction , a fourier representation in the ( @xmath69 ) plane in terms of @xmath70 , @xmath71 is convenient , @xmath72 we now seek the photon density response function @xmath73 , which describes the response of the photon density , @xmath74 , to the distribution of the population inversion , @xmath75 , in order to determine the transport coefficients . in the stationary case ( @xmath76 ) and in the long - wavelength limit along the ( @xmath69 ) plane ( @xmath77 ) , the @xmath3 derivative in eq .",

    "this is due to the loss of intensity at the surfaces .",
    "additionally , the mass term becomes less and less significant as the laser intensity in the sample builds up , because the relative population inversion clearly obeys @xmath84 whereas the relative photon number is not restricted .",
