    "nearly 30 years ago , padamanabhan @xcite performed a simple calculation suggesting that quantum gravitational fluctuations place a lower bound on distance measurements .",
    "he considered fluctuations of the conformal factor @xmath0 in metrics of the form @xmath1 while keeping the background metric @xmath2 classical . crudely speaking",
    ", padmanabhan argued that the conformal factor @xmath0 has a green s function that diverges as @xmath3 , in such a way that @xmath4 remains finite in the coincidence limit .",
    "this calculation was part of a larger approach to quantum gravity and quantum cosmology in which the conformal factor was treated as a dynamical field to be quantized , while the rest of the metric was treated as a classical field as in standard qft .",
    "this approach sidesteps some of the thornier conceptual problems associated with quantizing the metric , since conformal fluctuations preserve the causal structure of spacetime .",
    "however , this calculation is almost certainly wrong . in pure einstein - hilbert gravity ,",
    "the conformal factor is not a dynamical degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is most clearly seen using the york decomposition of symmetric tensors @xcite , in which the conformal factor is determined by a constraint equation similar to the gauss law constraint in electrodynamics .    to see where the argument went wrong",
    ", we must examine the path - integral approach taken by padmanabhan and narlikar @xcite .",
    "the classical action and path integral are @xmath5 = \\frac{1}{16 \\pi g } \\int \\rmd^4 x \\sqrt{-g}(r-2\\lambda ) \\label{ehaction}\\\\    z = \\int [ \\mathcal{d } g ] \\textrm{exp}\\left\\{\\rmi s[g]\\right\\ }    \\label{pathintegral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the conformal factor and background metric , the action becomes @xmath6 = \\frac{1}{16\\pi g}\\int \\rmd^4 x \\sqrt{-\\bar{g } }    \\left[\\bar{r}(1+\\phi(x))^2 - 2\\lambda ( 1+\\phi(x))^4 - 6\\phi^i\\phi_i\\right ]    \\label{ehconformalaction}\\ ] ] from here , the calculation proceeds in a straightforward manner .",
    "consider the expectation value of the interval in a ( minkowski ) vacuum state @xmath7 : @xmath8 however , @xmath9 evaluated at a single event diverges .",
    "using covariant point - splitting , we instead evaluate the interval between _ two events _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in the limit that @xmath12 . with the notation @xmath13 , we examine @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the action is just the action for a massless scalar field , albeit with a negative sign . ] , @xmath16=-\\frac{1}{2 l_p^2}\\int \\phi^i \\phi_i \\rmd^4x$ ] . the green s function is @xmath17 and so the interval becomes @xmath18 in other words , quantum fluctuations produce a `` ground state length '' just as a harmonic oscillator has a ground state energy .",
    "note that the path integral approach taken here obscures the fact that the conformal factor is not a true dynamical field subject to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the source of this confusion is the apparent kinetic term in the action , which justifies all subsequent steps leading to .",
    "however , in the hamiltonian framework , the trace part of the metric perturbations does not have a canonically conjugate momentum , and a true kinetic term for the conformal factor should not appear in the action .",
    "the explanation for the offending term is hidden in the measure of and was finally resolved by mazur and mottola @xcite . to identify the correct measure , they first decomposed the space of metric perturbations into diffeomorphisms and physical fluctuations .",
    "the remaining physical subspace was further decomposed into constrained ( conformal ) and dynamical ( transverse - traceless ) degrees of freedom .",
    "seen in this light , amounts to a change of coordinates in the space of metrics , which introduces a non - trivial jacobian in the measure .",
    "a field redefinition of the conformal factor then turns the apparent kinetic term in into a potential term , confirming the result that the conformal modes are non - propagating constrained modes .",
    "while the conformal factor is non - propagating in pure einstein - hilbert gravity , the classical constraints that fix the conformal part of the metric fluctuations in terms of matter sources can not be maintained upon quantization @xcite .",
    "the trace anomaly of matter coupled to gravity induces an effective action for the conformal factor that gives rise to non - trivial dynamics @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the conformal factor is promoted to a dynamical field when gravity is coupled to quantized matter .",
    "thus we can revisit padmanabhan s calculation in light of this dynamical model of the conformal factor .",
    "we begin by summarizing the basic results of antoniadis , mazur and mottola @xcite .",
    "the effective action of the conformal factor becomes local in the conformal parameterization @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a fiducial metric .",
    "the total effective action is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the einstein - hilbert action evaluated at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the action for matter fields , and @xmath25 is the trace anomaly - induced effective action @xcite @xmath26 = \\int \\rmd^4x \\sqrt{-\\bar{g } }        \\left[2b^\\prime \\sigma \\bar{\\delta}_4 \\sigma + b^\\prime \\left(\\bar{e } - \\frac{2}{3 } \\bar{\\box }        \\bar{r}\\right)\\sigma + b\\bar{f}\\sigma   \\right ] .",

    "the spin-0 and ghost contributions are included in the -8 and -28 factors , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 count the contributions from the spin-2 metric fields .",
    "because the values of these gravitational contributions , as well as contributions beyond the standard model , remain open questions , @xmath38 will be treated as a free parameter .",
    "the total trace anomaly of the full theory described by must vanish @xcite .",
    "the absence of this anomaly requires that the vacuum is a conformal fixed point at which the @xmath39 functions of all couplings must vanish .",
    "the physical metric then acquires an anomalous scaling dimension @xmath40 where @xmath41 is determined by the @xmath39 function for the einstein - hilbert action @xcite , @xmath42    from here we can follow padmanabhan s prescription . looking only at conformal fluctuations and choosing a minkowski fiducial metric @xmath7 , the action reduces to @xmath43 = -\\frac{q^2}{(4\\pi)^2}\\int \\rmd^4x \\sigma    \\bar{\\box}^2 \\sigma + \\frac{1}{8\\pi g}\\int \\rmd^4x \\left[3e^{2\\alpha \\sigma}\\left(\\partial_a \\sigma\\right)^2 - \\lambda    e^{4 \\alpha \\sigma}\\right ] .",

    "the second equality in is a standard field theory result that makes use of the baker - campbell - hausdorff relation @xcite and minkowski space @xcite confirm both of these requirements . ] .",
    "this yields the interesting result that the scaling depends on the matter content : the distance approaches zero for all values @xmath52 or @xmath53 . from ,",
    "positive values of @xmath54 are excluded at the conformal fixed point .",
    "the interval is constant at the critical point @xmath55 , and @xmath56 gives the nonsensical result that distances diverge in the limit @xmath57 . for large @xmath38 ,",
    "the interval scales as @xmath58 , and classical scaling is recovered in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "it follows from that @xmath60 for normal matter ; however , it is worth noting that some models of conformal supergravity contribute negatively to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "calculations of the one - loop contributions from einstein gravity place it at @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "together , the standard model particle content ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and one - loop gravitational contributions give a value @xmath64 the greatest uncertainty in the value of @xmath38 comes from the gravitational contributions , and a precise theoretical prediction for @xmath38 remains an open problem .",
    "recent attempts to place observational limits on @xmath38 using wmap data claim to limit @xmath38 to the range @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thus a more complete treatment of conformal fluctuations using the trace anomaly - induced effective action do not place a lower bound on the distance between two points .",
    "of course this result should be viewed with some skepticism . in particular , the spin-2 metric fluctuations are expected to become important around the planck scale but have been frozen out in this approach .",
    "additionally , the transition from einstein gravity to the conformally invariant phase described by is poorly understood , and more research is need to determine the scales at which the effective action becomes significant .",
