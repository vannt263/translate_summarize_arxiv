    ", the experiments aimed at understanding dark energy are quickly growing in number .",
    "galaxy surveys to map large scale structure and probe cosmology are becoming increasingly ambitious  both in terms of the cosmological volumes they probe , as well as in the development of technological advances necessary for more precise and efficient measurement of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "for example , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) plans to image @xmath1210 billion galaxies to @xmath4@xmath1326.5 with data in the @xmath14 photometric bands over @xmath1220,000deg@xmath15 of the southern sky .",
    "similar current and future wide field imaging experiments include the dark energy survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , euclid @xcite , and kids @xcite .",
    "traditionally , sources selected by color and/or magnitude from initial imaging data in a handful of frequency bands were followed up with conventional dispersed spectrographs in order to obtain accurate redshifts . however , in the coming data rich era , this approach is not possible .",
    "even the largest planned fiber - fed multi - object spectrographs can not hope to follow up even 1% of the lsst catalog @xcite .",
    "one of the most important lsst science goals uses independent probes to measure the effect of dark energy : weak gravitational lensing ( wl ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) and galaxy clusters ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "all of these techniques , however , rely on the precise determination of redshifts for as many galaxies and quasars as possible @xcite , most of which will be faint given the steeply rising number counts towards fainter magnitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "redshifts estimated from galaxy colors in a handful of broad bands have significant problems @xcite since photometric accuracy depends on spectral coverage , resolution and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "the biases and the high catastrophic failure rates that result from redshift determination using standard photometry add significant errors to the dark energy measurements @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads away from broad band imaging towards massively multiplexed low resolution spectroscopy or spectrophotometry .",
    "we consider a new instrument and survey , giga-@xmath0 , that will take low resolution spectra and find the redshifts of two billion objects in the lsst field down to @xmath525@xmath16 magnitude in @xmath17 band .",
    "this survey , when combined with lsst imaging , will enable unique galaxy science .",
    "giga-@xmath0 is made possible by optical through near - ir microwave kinetic inductance detectors ( mkids ; * ? ? ?",

    "mkids , described in section  [ sec : mkids ] , are nearly ideal , noiseless photon detectors , as they do not suffer from read noise or dark current , and have nearly perfect cosmic ray rejection . in giga-@xmath0 ,",
    "described in section  [ sec : expt ] , mkids will be used in a configuration similar to a conventional multi - object spectrograph , but without the use of a wavelength dispersive element . giga-@xmath0 could be on the sky by 2020 , and with 3 years on a 4-m telescope could improve on the lsst constraints for @xmath18 , the dark energy equation of state parameter , and @xmath9 , its evolution , and in conjunction with lsst map the distribution of dark matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sim_obs ] explains the development of mock catalogs from simulated observations for both lsst and giga-@xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : photozs ] describes the redshift estimation , and compares results for the two experiments , as well as a summary of statistics for current or planned survey projects with similar science goals .",
    "we explore dark energy parameter constraints in section [ sec : de ] , and conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "large formats , high quantum efficiency , and low readout noise make semiconductor detectors the most popular type of detector used in the optical and near - ir wavelength regime .",
    "however , thermal noise from their high ( @xmath12100k ) operating temperatures and the semiconductor band gap place fundamental limits . reducing gap parameters by a factor of a thousand can be achieved with cryogenic superconducting detectors , operating at around 100mk .",
    "a superconducting detector can count single photons with no false counts while determining the energy ( to a few percent ) and arrival time ( to roughly 1@xmath19s ) of the incoming photon .",
    "since the photon energy is always much greater than the gap energy , much broader wavelength coverage is possible , enabling observations at infrared wavelengths that are vital to understanding the high redshift universe .",
    "a cryogenic detector technology with sensitivity and ease of multiplexing initially demonstrated at millimeter wavelengths @xcite are mkids @xcite .",
    "intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing allows thousands of pixels to be read out over a single microwave cable @xcite .",
    "they can count individual photons with no false counts and determine the energy and arrival time of every photon with good quantum efficiency @xcite . their physical pixel size and maximum count rate",
    "are well matched with large telescopes .",
    "these capabilities enable powerful new astrophysical instruments usable from the ground and space .",
    "the mkids described here are sensitive to 0.15@xmath19 m wavelength radiation ( with cutoffs imposed by the sky count rate and the properties of the materials being used ) but are optimized for near infrared ( nir ) and optical wavelengths ( 3501350 nm ) .",
    "the array camera for optical to near - ir spectrophotometry ( arcons ) is the first ever optical / nir mkid camera .",
    "it was commissioned in july , 2011 at the palomar 200 inch telescope and as of december 2012 , has now observed over a combined 24 nights on the lick and palomar telescopes @xcite . some of the science targets observed include interacting binaries ( am cvns , lmxbs , short period eclipsing sources ) , qsos ( for low resolution redshift measurements ) , supernovae ( type ia and type ii ) and the crab pulsar .",
    "arcons , representing the current state of optical mkids , houses a 2,024 detector array ( figure [ fig : mkids ] ) , making it the largest optical / uv camera based on low temperature detectors by an order of magnitude .        the energy resolution of the devices , r(=e/@xmath2e ) , currently about 20 at 254 nm ( or about 12 at 423 nm ) , can reasonably be expected to continue to improve towards the theoretical limit of 150 at 254 nm over the next several years as designs and materials evolve .",
    "furthermore , the parallel technologies of infrared - blocking filters , broadband antireflection coatings , and detector quantum efficiency continue to develop , which will increase the performance of arcons and giga-@xmath0 .",
    "conventional multi - object spectrographs employ a mask inserted at the focal plane to pass light from targets through the slits ( or apertures ) , blocking background sky and other nearby source photons to reduce sky noise and contamination .",
    "a dispersive element such as a diffraction grating or prism then spreads the light as a function of wavelength on a detector .",
    "the supermos concept uses the same mask - based approach to reduce sky background and contamination from other sources , but uses the intrinsic energy resolving capability of each mkid detector to measure the spectrum .",
    "since each mkid pixel provides spectral information the focal plane is used much more efficiently , yielding a simple and compact system . a very simple implementation for giga-@xmath0",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : optics ] , envisioned as an instrument for the cassegrain or naysmith focus of a dedicated 4 m class telescope .        aside from the inherent energy resolution of mkids ,",
    "giga-@xmath0 is enabled by the large pixel counts possible with mkids .",
    "one square degree field of view can be divided among 100,000 detectors , each fed by a macropixel covering 10@xmath2010  of the sky to be able to cover 20,000 square degrees in a reasonable amount of time ( see figure  [ fig : pix ] ) .",
    "galaxy number counts in @xmath21 band to 24.5@xmath16 magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ensure that @xmath2280% of the macropixels will contain a galaxy at each pointing .",
    "a mask cut using pre - existing lsst ( or earlier dark energy survey ) imaging would permit light from one celestial source per macropixel into a reimaging system that focused the light onto the corresponding large plate scale mkid located directly below .",
    "fov is divided into 100,000 10x10  macropixels .",
    "the background hubble udf image is for illustrative purposes and not to scale , with macropixels delineated in blue .",
    "existing catalogs will be used to select a target for each macropixel , and a corresponding hole drilled into a metal mask ( purple circle ) , with the diameter allowed to vary depending on the object size and shape .",
    "source light passing through the mask will land on the corresponding mkid with the same plate scale as the macropixel .",
    "some subset of macropixels for each field will be selected to monitor the sky background ( yellow circles ) . ]",
    "we note two potential drawbacks to this aperture masking technique : @xmath320,000 precut masks are required , and it limits the galaxy sampling to a relatively uniform spacing , making observations of galaxy clusters more difficult .",
    "however , a dedicated laser mask - milling facility can address the first issue ( such masks have been made for e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and careful survey design incorporating fields with multiple visits can ameliorate the second .    in @xmath3 15 minutes adequate",
    "s / n can be achieved to determine the redshift of galaxies with magnitudes @xmath525 ( section [ sec : photozs ] ) .",
    "assuming 80% of the macropixels contain a source , giga-@xmath0 would acquire @xmath3320,000 spectra per hour .",
    "rapid mask changes can be performed with pre - loaded cartridges , and the photon counting nature of the mkids allows the mask to be aligned using real time feedback from the science array . in one night with 8 hours of observing ,",
    "this equates to @xmath3 2.5 million spectra per night . at this rate , the entire lsst field",
    "could be covered in about three years .",
    "lsst will provide galaxy shapes and radii .",
    "assuming that poisson statistics from the sky dominates errors , the mask hole radius that maximizes s / n is proportional to the encircled energy squared over the area of the hole , which depends upon the light profile of the target . for an object with a gaussian profile , for example , the s /",
    "n is maximized by capturing @xmath372% of a galaxy s light . for more realistic profiles ,",
    "it is slightly less than this .",
    "the cosmos mock catalog ( cmc ; section [ sec : cmc ] ) indicates that the majority of galaxies out to high redshift have half light radii equal to less than half an arcsecond .",
    "this scale translates to hole diameters of @xmath340@xmath19 m in the design presented here , well within the limits of current laser drilling technology .",
    "seeing conditions at the site may broaden galaxy profiles , and therefore must also be taken into account when determining hole size .",
    "mkids have a maximum count rate which can be tuned to some degree during fabrication to fall within the range @xmath31,00010,000 counts / pixel / s .",
    "the hole sizes for very bright or large galaxies would likely require accounting for the maximum allowable photon count rate .",
    "when working into the near - ir , sky subtraction becomes a dominant concern . for giga-@xmath0 ,",
    "concurrent with galaxy target selection from the lsst imaging will be the selection of known dark areas of the sky .",
    "approximately 1020% of the macropixels in a typical observation , greater than 10,000 mkids , will collect approximately 1,000 photons per second from the sky ( based on the gemini south model ) , with each photon individually time tagged to within a microsecond .",
    "this sky background data can then be used to build up a map consisting of spectra as a function of time at every point on the array , facilitating the subtraction of the sky background to the poisson limit over the entire spectral range of the detectors . in @xmath23 band , for example , with a sky brightness of roughly 16.6 magnitudes per square arcsecond , a 24.5@xmath16 magnitude galaxy with about half of its light falling in 1 square arcsecond would have a contrast ratio of @xmath35e-4 .",
    "figure [ fig : sedswptsjy ] shows this measured at a few sigma in a 15 minute exposure .",
    "different mask hole positions within a macropixel illuminate the mkid very slightly differently , so both the throughput and quantum efficiency of each mkid will need to be calibrated as a function of mask hole position . stray light , for example , may be an important factor , involving cross - talk from one mask hole to another s corresponding detector .",
    "these differences can be calibrated through laboratory and on - sky testing .",
    "no fringing effects have been observed with arcons .",
    "the cosmos mock catalog ( cmc ; * ? ? ? * ) makes use of the latest survey data gathered through deep extragalactic surveys .",
    "it was specifically designed to be used to forecast the yields of future dark energy surveys , by converting the observed properties of each cosmos galaxy into simulated properties that can then be viewed using any instrument configuration .",
    "thus we combine the synthetic galaxy spectra from the cmc with our instrument throughput model to generate catalogs of simulated giga-@xmath0 ( and lsst ) observations .",
    "the cmc is based on the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) observations @xcite which cover approximately 2 square degrees with 30-band photometry from multiple instruments spanning x - ray through radio frequencies .",
    "the subset used as input for the cmc is the photometric redshift catalog , covering a central 1.24 square degree patch fully covered by hst / acs imaging and not masked , providing a sample of 538,000 objects down to @xmath24@xmath1326.5 @xcite .    for each galaxy ,",
    "agn , or star , a best fit template is assigned based on the 30-band photometry . the same template is used for the redshift fit , and comes from a composite library of elliptical , spiral and starburst galaxy templates and stellar templates used by the @xmath25 photo-@xmath0 code .",
    "the best fit templates are redshifted and scaled to be in the observer s frame , assuming a perfect instrument ( perfect efficiency , delta function psf , etc . ) .",
    "two possible downsides to using these observations are the potential bias due to faint agn contribution , and the possible bias in the redshift distribution at @xmath0@xmath221.25 , where the photo-@xmath0 s from the observed catalog become degraded . to ensure a representative population , the cmc was compared with catalogs from the hst ultra deep field , goods and vvds - deep surveys for galaxy count , color , redshift and emission - line distributions , and found to be consistent .",
    "the cmc was updated in 2011 ( version july 15 , 2011 ) to improve the estimation of emission line fluxes , incorporated in the simulated galaxy seds , which we have used for the simulations presented here .",

    "we take optical throughput to be 0.7 , accounting for @xmath34% loss at each of five lenses and @xmath310% loss at an ir - blocking filter .",
    "since the qe for the mkid detectors in arcons varied between roughly 73% at 200 nm and 22% at 3@xmath19 m @xcite , and there is significant room for improvement ( section [ sec : mkids ] ) , we assume a constant mkid qe of 0.75 for giga-@xmath0 .",

    "this is likely an overestimate of the far - red continuum brightness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a subdominant effect at r@xmath29=30 , as oh lines will be the primary contributor and thus we deem this a conservative estimate .",
    "the lunar phase assumed is within 7 nights from new moon ( `` dark '' , but not `` darkest '' ) , where the @xmath30 magnitude of the sky is @xmath320.7mag / arcsec@xmath15 . in practice , grey time can likely be used without significant degradation .",
    "mkids do not require the use of filters for information about the energy of the incoming photons .",
    "however , in order to compare our results with the lsst simulated photometry as transparently as possible and to be able to use existing redshift estimation codes without having to develop our own at this time , we can simulate effective photometric bands as independent spectral resolution elements .",
    "collected photons are separated into energy bins , thus an effective filter would take the form of the error distribution of the energy determination convolved with a tophat , which represents the quantization of binning .",
    "since photon energies are determined by a fit to the phase shift of the mkid with time , we can choose bins small compared to the true resolution so as not to impose any additional degradation .",
    "for the analysis presented here , each `` filter '' is a gaussian , centered in wavelength one full width half maximum ( fwhm ) away from its neighbors , where    @xmath31    r@xmath32 is equal to 30 at the fiducial @xmath33 which we take here to be 423 nm , and decreases linearly with increasing wavelengths .",

    "as well , each pseudo - filter sees the same observing conditions with time , simplifying analysis considerably , a second major advantage over usual multi - filter photometry . in practice , for an mkid array , a more optimal solution would be to take the photon events and construct a maximum likelihood algorithm to reconstruct the spectrum .    combining these throughput models as a function of wavelength for the various loss mechanisms gives the total expected system throughput depicted in figure [ fig : through ] ( bottom panel ) .",

    "indeed , as will be seen in section [ sec : photoz_res ] , photometric depth does not equate to photometric redshift accuracy . despite high s / n , the lsst filter set ( r@xmath35 ) inevitably leads to more color - redshift degeneracies , making unambiguous redshift determination impossible for the majority of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "very accurate photo-@xmath0 s are required to optimally exploit the expected data sets of dark energy surveys such as des , lsst and euclid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the best photometric results arise when strong continuum breaks in a galaxy spectrum fall between two instrument filters , and are therefore well constrained .",
    "one such typical feature of early - type galaxies is the 4000break which arises from the onset of stellar photospheric opacity due to the absorption of mainly ionized metals ( e.g. caii ) in the atmospheres of late - type stars .",

    "lastly , sources at high redshifts have spectra that exhibit a suppressed continuum blueward of 1216  ( ly-@xmath7 ) due to additional opacity from line blanketing by intervening gas clouds along the line of sight .",

    "using each code , accuracies were determined for global photo-@xmath0 bias , scatter , and outlier rates .",
    "differences between codes stemmed mainly from whether they were empirical or template - fitting , the training set in the former case and the template set in the latter , the use of priors , handling of the lyman-@xmath7 forest and the benefit of adding mid - ir photometry . for a detailed discussion of photo-@xmath0 methods and their common elements",

    "the three photo-@xmath0 codes which ranked highest were @xmath25 @xcite , bayesian photo-@xmath0 s @xcite and eazy @xcite .",
    "the best results were achieved by using an empirical code ( smaller biases ) or optimizing templates , and correcting for systematic offsets .",
    "one reason to favor a template - based photo-@xmath0 code without any required training for this study is that the galaxies probed by upcoming surveys will span a cosmological volume and parameter space much greater than what can be well represented currently through spectroscopy .",

    "furthermore , the user may apply @xcite igm absorption to templates .    by default , a probability - weighted integral",
    "is taken over the full redshift grid in order to assign an object redshift , marginalizing over the posterior redshift probability distribution ( in lieu of e.g. assigning the single most likely redshift by @xmath40 minimization , although the user has control over which ) .",
    "though this does not permit simple spectral classification , the increased photo-@xmath0 precision and ability to reproduce complex star - formation histories by fitting non - negative linear combinations of the templates may allow for better physical separation of photometric samples .",
    "one particular feature is the applicability to a wider range of redshifts and intrinsic colors than would be possible with an empirical photo-@xmath0 code , as no representative training set exists .",
    "the default eazy template set was generated using the @xcite non - negative matrix factorization method to reduce the stellar population synthesis code pgase model library @xcite to five `` principle component '' spectral templates of the calibration catalog .",
