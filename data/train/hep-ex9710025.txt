    "in an e@xmath3e@xmath4 collider both beam electrons can radiate virtual photons which interact with each other .",
    "these photons are described by their negative four - momentum transfer @xmath5 which is usually small ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they can therefore be considered to be quasi - real . accordingly",
    "the beam electrons are scattered with very small angles and are not detected ( anti - tagged ) .",
    "events where one or both scattered electrons are detected are called single - tagged or double - tagged  [ 1 ] .",
    "+ the interactions of the photons can be modelled by assuming that each photon can either interact directly or appear resolved through its fluctuations into hadronic states . in leading order quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "this model leads to three different event classes for @xmath7 interactions : direct , single - resolved and double - resolved . in resolved events the partons ( quarks or gluons ) inside the photon take part in the hard interaction .",
    "the probability to find partons inside the photon is parametrised by parton density functions .",
    "+ due to the direct photon interactions the transverse momentum distribution of the charged hadrons in two - photon interactions is expected to have a harder component than in photon - proton or hadron - proton interactions .",
    "this is demonstrated by comparing the @xmath7 data to photo- and hadroproduction data measured by wa69  [ 2 ] .",
    "+ events with two jets ( dijet events ) offer the possibility to separate direct and resolved processes .",
    "the jet cross - sections can be compared to qcd calculations using different structure function parametrisations .",
    "resolved processes are especially sensitive to the gluon content of the photon .",
    "we present the first measurement of inclusive charged hadron production in anti - tagged @xmath7 collisions .",
    "the data were taken in 1996 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20 pb@xmath8 .",
    "+ to select anti - tagged two - photon events a set of cuts is applied to the data , the most important cuts are : the visible invariant hadronic mass @xmath9 measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter has to be greater than 3 gev , to reject multihadronic events the sum of all energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters should be less than 45 gev and at least 3 tracks must have been found in the tracking chambers which rejects lepton pair events . to select only anti - tagged events",
    "there is a cut on the maximum energy deposit in the forward and silicon tungsten calorimeters that are located at small angles . after applying",
    "the whole set of cuts around 59000 events remain .",
    "[ f : jpatt:1 ] shows the differential cross - section d@xmath10/d@xmath11 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the hadrons .",
    "the data are compared with results from @xmath12p and hp scattering ( h=@xmath13,k ) from the wa69 experiment which have been normalised to the @xmath7 data . at",
    "@xmath14 2 gev / c the data lie significantly above the exponentially falling @xmath12p and hp data due to the contribution from the direct @xmath7 interactions .",
    "the @xmath7 data are also compared to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations  [ 3 ] containing the three components of the direct , single - resolved and double - resolved processes .",
    "the calculations show clearly the dominance of the direct component at large transverse momenta .",
    "most hadrons have small transverse momenta , in a regime where the resolved component dominates .",
    "this means that in most cases the photon behaves like a hadron .",
    "the same data and a similar set of cuts as in the charged hadron analysis are used to investigate the production of jets in anti - tagged @xmath7 interactions  [ 4 ] . to select jets a cone jet finding algorithm",
    "is applied to the data requiring a minimum transverse energy of the jets of @xmath15 3 gev , the pseudorapidity @xmath16 to be less than 2 and the cone size @xmath17 to be equal to 1 .",
    "+ especially events where two jets are found offer the possibility to differentiate between direct and resolved interactions  [ 5 ] .",
    "a pair of variables , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , can be defined which is a measure of the photon s energy participating in the hard interaction : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum component along the @xmath22 axis of the detector and @xmath23 is the energy of the jets or hadrons . in direct events",
    "the whole energy is concentrated in the two jets whereas in resolved events there is also energy outside the two jet cones due to the remnant of the resolved photon(s ) .",
    "so events with @xmath24 0.8 mainly stem from direct and events with @xmath25 0.8 mainly from resolved processes .",
    "+ in direct events quark exchange dominates the interaction , whereas gluon exchange dominates in resolved events .",
    "this gives rise to different angular distributions which can be seen in fig .",
