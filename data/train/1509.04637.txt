    "quantum markovian master equations are the simplest but also the most used cases of study for the dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "the concept of open systems plays an important role since perfect isolation in the quantum realm and access to all degrees of freedom is not possible .",
    "the main source of inspiration was the theory of lasers where models describing the interaction of a central subsystem weakly coupled to an uncontrollable environment were studied . in the last two decades",
    "there has been great interest in the study of composite quantum systems in order to create entanglement between them @xcite with the ultimate aim to realize quantum information procedures @xcite .",
    "however , there is always an environment causing decoherence which is also the bottleneck to realize highly efficient quantum information protocols .",
    "therefore the theory of open quantum systems was frequently applied to various models @xcite .",
    "there is a subclass of models which can be decomposed into many interacting parts which in turn are coupled to independent environments .",
    "the best example is the case of two - level atoms interacting with a single mode of the radiation field and coupled to independent reservoirs , like the model of the many - atom laser @xcite or the one - atom maser @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the composite system is derived from a microscopic model or is assembled on the ground of phenomenological considerations from equations which describe independently the parts .",
    "the latter case usually assumes a low coupling strength between the two parties which allows a separate description of dissipative effects . in both cases the possible treatments of environments consist in markovian and non - markovian approaches @xcite . obtaining the full solution to",
    "the dynamical equation is a very complicated task even with a markovian approach @xcite and sometimes one has to be satisfied by identifying the steady state @xcite or its symmetry properties @xcite . in general , the role of the interaction in a composed system was studied typically for two coupled harmonic oscillators @xcite and for two interacting identical atoms @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the case when two independent quantum systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 are subject to markovian master equations and their interaction is studied through an equation which is obtained by adding the two master equations to a hamiltonian interaction . for physical systems , this consideration usually implies that the interaction strength between @xmath0 and @xmath1 has to be the smallest parameter in the system .",
    "we concentrate on a special class of interaction hamiltonians that cause dephasing on system @xmath0 and lead to a generator ( liouvillian ) of the complete system that commutes with the liouvillian of system @xmath0 s master equation .",
    "the motivating example is the optomechanical coupling between a single - mode electromagnetic field and a small mechanical oscillator in the presence of independent decoherence mechanisms @xcite .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the considered class of interaction hamiltonians leads to an invariant steady state of system @xmath0 , i.e. , tracing out system @xmath1 in the steady state of the composite system one always obtains the same steady state of system @xmath0 which is independent of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast , the steady state of system @xmath1 may depend on the interaction . in the case of finite dimensional systems , theorems of linear algebra",
    "can be employed to prove the statement . however ,",
    "when dealing with infinite dimensional systems a different and more sophisticated method is required .",
    "therefore , the proof of the invariant steady state is based on the properties of quantum dynamical semigroups where we employ the trotter product formula and identify the growth bounds of the master equations .",
    "while the proof of our statement is rather general we will explicitly show it in some simple models .",
    "the steady state of system @xmath1 does not have any particular property and its solution is model dependent . therefore in our examples we study the steady state of system @xmath1 by analyzing its average excitation .",

    "there are many physical situations in which the dynamics of the system can be decomposed into two parties subject to a hamiltonian interaction .",
    "the individual sub - systems might include a relaxation mechanism that under the markovian assumption leads to a master equation for the density matrix @xmath2 of the composite system that can be written as @xmath3 .",

    "one system that allows this type of separation and has gained a lot of recent interest is the model of optomechanical coupling , where the radiation field and a mechanical oscillator are coupled via radiation pressure . in the single mode scenario , numerical simulations show that the steady state of the radiation field remains independent of the coupling strength and of the parameters of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "this interesting effect can be generalized to two systems where one of them is composed of spins and harmonic oscillators and the other system stays arbitrary and the interaction between them holds the same symmetries as the optomechanical coupling . in the following we motivate the problem by showing the optomechanical model .",
    "we consider the simplest hamiltonian describing the interaction between a single mode of the radiation field and a vibrational mode of a mechanical oscillator .",
    "this interaction is derived for a cavity with a moving mirror @xcite and the quantization of the radiation field is considered with time - varying boundary conditions . the single mode assumption for both quantized field and mirror motion",

    "it is not a complicated task to show that the composite steady state is insensitive to the interaction in this situation .",

    "are negligible in the low coupling regime for low values of @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , with the new generations of optomechanical systems reaching the strong coupling regime and for microwave frequencies , this effect can become important .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if the coupling is too strong , a more detailed model of the loss mechanisms has to be considered such as in ref .",
    "@xcite where the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq . where used to derive the corresponding master equation .",

    "stirling s formula in an inequality form @xcite @xmath441 and the relation @xmath442 yield @xmath443 thus , we have found that all the solutions to eq . for @xmath98 fulfill the inequality @xmath444 because it contains a harmonic series .    in the next step",
    "we show that eq .",
    "is upper bounded by @xmath74 due to some general facts of operator theory .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary separable hilbert space @xmath83 with an orthonormal basis @xmath445 .",
    "the set of hilbert - schmidt operators @xmath446 with the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath447 is a hilbert space and it is also a two - sided ideal in @xmath336(see theorem vi.22 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath448 in our case the hilbert space @xmath346 and any density matrix @xmath449 ( @xmath450 ) and @xmath451 ( @xmath452 ) .    now let us consider the right shift operator @xmath453 any @xmath78th power of the right shift operator @xmath454 is also a bounded operator",

    "the cauchy - schwarz - bunyakovski inequality for the hilbert - schmidt inner product gives : @xmath457 we observe that for the hilbert - schmidt operators @xmath458 and @xmath459 @xmath460 where we used the relation @xmath461 , the identity operator on @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , eq . obviously leads to @xmath462 which is true if and only if @xmath463 . if @xmath463 , then all the upper diagonal elements of @xmath464 are zero .",
    "it is immediate from the self - adjoint property of @xmath464 that all lower diagonal elements are also equal to zero .",
    "finally , we can conclude that @xmath464 has only non - zero elements in the diagonal which are given in eq . .",
