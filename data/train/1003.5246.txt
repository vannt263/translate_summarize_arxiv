    "during the last 10 years the interest of physicists in non - local field theories has been steadily increasing .",
    "the main reason for this development is the expectation , that the use of these field theories will lead to a much more elegant and effective way of treating problems in particle and high - energy physics as it is possible up to now with local field theories .",
    "a particular subgroup of non - local field theories can be described with operators of fractional nature and is specified within the framework of fractional calculus [ @xcite]-[@xcite ] .",
    "fractional calculus provides us with a set of axioms and methods to extend the concept of a derivative operator from integer order n to arbitrary order @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is a real or complex value .",
    "a particular successful application within the framework of fractional calculus is fractional group theory , which extends a classical symmetry group to the analogue fractional symmetry group .",
    "this implies a generalization of the classical symmetry and allows for a broader description of natural phenomena .",
    "the investigation of the properties of the fractional rotation group alone has lead to a vast amount of intriguing and valuable results .",
    "one reason for this success is the strategy , to interpret concrete experimental data and strictly verify the theoretical results with experimental findings .",
    "important achievements are :    * exact prediction of the masses of y(4260 ) und x(4664 ) in the charmonium - spectrum , which were verified experimentally afterwards [ @xcite ] . * the first application of fractional calculus in nuclear theory : a successful description of ground state band excitations in even - even nuclei [ @xcite ] . * a first derivation of the exact form of interacting fractional fields in lowest order of the coupling constant and a first application : a high precision mass formula for baryon masses [ @xcite ] .",
    "* deduction of the fractional dynamic symmetry group , which simultaneously describes the magic numbers in nuclei [ @xcite ] and metal clusters [ @xcite ] .    in the following",
    "we will classify the complete set of available ground state meson spectra according to multiplets of the fractional rotation group @xmath1 based on the caputo definition of the fractional derivative .",
    "in order to derive the mass formula we will use , we start with the caputo definition of a fractional derivative : [ @xcite ] : @xmath2 applied to a function set @xmath3 this leads to : @xmath4   \\ , x^{(n-1)\\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we now introduce the fractional angular momentum operators or generators of infinitesimal rotations in the @xmath6 plane on the @xmath7-dimensional euclidean space : @xmath8 which result from canonical quantization of the classical angular momentum definition .",
    "the commutation relations of the fractional angular momentum operators are isomorphic to the fractional extension of the rotational group @xmath9 : @xmath10 & = & i\\hbar { _ \\textrm{\\tiny{c}}}{f_{ijkl}}^{mn}(\\alpha){_\\textrm{\\tiny{c}}}l_{mn}(\\alpha ) \\\\ & &   \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad i , j , k , l , m , n=1,2, .. ,n \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with structure coefficients @xmath11 .",
    "their explicit form depends on the function set the fractional angular momentum operators act on and on the fractional derivative type used .    in the case",
    "@xmath12 , according to the group chain @xmath13 there are two casimir - operators @xmath14 , namely @xmath15 we introduce the two quantum numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which completely determine the eigen functions @xmath18 .",

    "the hamiltonian is explicitly given as : @xmath22 with the free parameters @xmath23 measured in units [ mev ] and the basis is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore we obtain eigen values of the hamiltonian as : @xmath24{_\\textrm{\\tiny{c}}}[l+1 ] + b_0{_\\textrm{\\tiny{c}}}[m]\\ ] ] in the next section we will apply ( [ zlc ] ) as a four parameter @xmath25 chiral mass formula to classify the multiplets of available meson spectra .",
    "with ( [ zlc ] ) we obtain a satisfying description of all mesonic ground state excitation spectra simultaneously if we associate the quantum numbers @xmath26 with the corresponding mesonic excitation states .    in a first simplified approach",
    "we will treat the up- and down - quarks as similar and will investigate the properties of mesons of the family @xmath27 . in figure [ fqs ] the spectra for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and",

    "the vast amount of experimental data allows the determination of optimum parameter sets @xmath31 without difficulty .",
    "the fitted optimum parameter sets and the corresponding root mean square error are given in table [ values ] .",
    "the predicted energies for the ground states @xmath32 can not be described with standard phenomenological potential models [ @xcite ] and are therefore an important indicator for the validity of the fractional concept .",
    "since we apply the caputo fractional derivative , the ground state masses are directly determined by parameter @xmath33 .",

    ".    free parameters of the fractional model ( [ zlc ] ) were determined by a fit with the experimental data . for light quarks",
    "there were no problems using a fit procedure since the experimental data base is broad enough .",
    "for heavy quarks we have only a limited number of experimental data .",
    "consequently it is essential to deduce systematic trends in order to choose the parameter values despite the fact that there is only a small number of experimental data .    using conventional phenomenological models a survey of strangeonium , charmonium and bottomonium states",
    "did not reveal a systematic trend for the parameter sets derived [ @xcite ] .",
    "the fundamental new aspect for an interpretation of meson spectra within the framework of a fractional rotation group is the fact , that systematic trends for the parameters may be deduced and may be used for a universal description of all possible mesonic ground state excitations .",
    "for example from table [ values ] we may deduce a systematic trend for the optimum fractional derivative parameter @xmath0 for different mesonic systems .",
    "we may explain these values quantitatively , if we attribute to every quark and anti - quark respectively a multiplicative quantum number @xmath57 ( in analogy to hyper - charge ) : @xmath58 with the requirement that @xmath0 follows from the product @xmath59 as a consequence , using ( [ xalpha ] ) we may make predictions for quark - anti - quark combinations , where the experimental basis is yet too small to determine all parameters of the model ( [ zlc ] ) simultaneously .",
    "these predicted @xmath0-values are labelled with ( * ) in table [ values ] .    a comparison of the optimum parameter sets for different quark anti - quark combinations reveals some common aspects :    for all mesons except charmonium the parameter @xmath60 is of similar magnitude of order @xmath61 $ ] with a weak tendency to higher values for heavy mesons .",
    "in addition , the value for the fractional magnetic field strength @xmath62 for all mesons except kaons is about @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "furthermore there seems to exist a saturation limit for the field strength @xmath64 which is reached for charmonium . for bottomonium which is about three times heavier , the calculated @xmath62 turns out to be @xmath65 $ ] , which is @xmath66 of the charmonium value .",
    "most probably an additional enhancement of the field strength could exceed the critical energy density for the creation of a light quark anti - quark pair e.g. a pion .",
    "consequently in view of a fractional mass formula ( [ zlc ] ) the different meson spectra have a great deal in common which allows for an estimate of the spectrum of @xmath52-mesons , where up to now , only the @xmath53-meson has been verified experimentally .",
    "in table [ values ] we have indicated the values interpolated with ( * ) .    to summarize our results :",
    "based on the fractional mass formula ( [ zlc ] ) we found a general systematic in the ground state excitation spectra of mesons .",
    "consequently we were able to classify all ground state excitation states for all possible mesons up to the bottom - quark as multiplets of the fractional rotation group @xmath67 .",
    "finally we may speculate about an internal structure of quarks .",
    "we have calculated the ground state masses @xmath33 for all possible excitation spectra of mesons .",
    "let us assume that @xmath33 is the sum of the masses of two hypothetical constituent quarks ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 we perform a fit procedure of parameter @xmath33 from table [ values ] according to ( [ m0 ] ) and obtain : @xmath70 \\\\ q_s & \\approx &   302 [ \\textrm{mev } ] \\\\ q_c & \\approx & 1210 [ \\textrm{mev } ] \\\\ q_b & \\approx & 4800 [ \\textrm{mev } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a remarkable coincidence is the fact that @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , the mass of every constituent quark is four times its predecessor .",
    "we obtain a rule @xmath74 with @xmath75 $ ] .    from this result",
    "we may speculate , that quarks exhibit an internal structure .",
    "four constituents with mass @xmath76 constitute an up - constituent quark , 16 built up a strange - constituent quark etc .",
    "therefore we naively guess , that this is a hint for an internal @xmath77-symmetry .",
    "furthermore we can make predictions for heavier quarkonia .",
    "we obtain @xmath78 , \\quad \\alpha = \\sqrt{{6 \\over 7}}\\\\ b^ * \\bar{b}^*(j=6 ) & \\approx & 155 \\pm 20[\\textrm{gev } ] ,   \\quad \\alpha = 1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so we are left with the problem , why these quarkonia have not been observed yet .",
    "it should be mentioned , that confinement is a natural property of free solutions of a fractional wave equation with @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the constituents of the @xmath80 quarkonia are predicted to be quarks , which are not confined . as a consequence they are free particles .",
    "it is at least remarkable , that indeed there are direct observations of top - events near @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "therefore within the framework of fractional calculus , the top - quark could be interpreted as a @xmath80 constituent quarkonium state .",
    "we have shown , that the full variety of mesonic excitations may be interpreted as a fractional rotation spectrum , if we apply the caputo definition of the fractional derivative .",
    "the fractional parameter @xmath0 , deduced from experiment , may be interpreted as a multiplicative fractional quantum number , which may be assigned to a specific quark flavour in analogy to the well known hyper charge .    since in [ @xcite ] we demonstrated , that the ground state baryon spectra may be interpreted as multiplets of the fractional rotation group based in the riemann derivative definition , the only difference between baryons and mesons within the framework of fractional calculus is the presence and absence of a zero point energy contribution to the fractional rotational energy respectively .",
