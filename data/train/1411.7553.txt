    "our current understanding of the universe and of its history relies on several puzzling observational features .",
    "in fact , soon after the discovery of the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) , theoretical physicists realized that the early universe had to follow a rapid expanding phase .",
    "inflation was the first candidate for generating such expansion , and a more refined version of inflation is still at the basis of the current standard cosmological model .",
    "there are compelling evidences for a rapid expanding phase , which have culminated in the recent results of the bicep and planck collaborations @xcite .",
    "the current standard model of the universe involves an inflation field , but current experimental results , meanwhile ruling out many proposed models , seem not to exclude several other proposals alternative to inflation@xcite .",
    "inflation has the advantage of the occam s razor , as it accounts for all the puzzles involved with our current understanding of the universe , such as its flatness and acceleration , its entropy and the horizon problem in one shot .",
    "however , an alternative and interesting proposal relies on the idea of cyclicality of the universe , a concept almost as old as general relativity .",
    "cosmological bounce models have a long history , with its first proposal put forward by tolman @xcite , and have been proposed in several different contexts @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that oscillating cosmological universes can provide a solution to both flatness and horizon problems , as long as maximum of the expansion in each cycle is increased in the next cycle .",
    "quantum gravitational phenomena play a role only in the extremely early universe . in this scenario ,",
    "quantum gravity is the force that makes the bounce occur .",
    "in fact , a big bounce has been observed in several quantum gravitational cosmological theories , as for instance loop quantum cosmology @xcite , epkyrotic strings@xcite , asymptotically safe non - local gravity @xcite and in general relativity with matter - torsion interaction @xcite just to name few .    in the present paper , we ask ourselves whether such bouncing phenomena has some physical , long - term effects at the quantum level . at the classical level , we find this unlikely to occur .",
    "however , one could argue that considering the universe conformal factor as an external parameter , in a bouncing cosmology a berry phase might emerge at the quantum level .",
    "this is the scenario we are interested in : does a scalar field maintain a quantum memory from previous bounces ?",
    "we answer this question in the modest nonphysical scenario of a scalar field in a bouncing cosmology , in which the scalar field does not lead to any backreaction on the underlying metric ; yet , this toy model features many of the stylized characteristics of bouncing cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the berry phase has been already considered in the cosmological setting , by for the case of inflationary models @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the berry phase is not a measurable quantity if the scalar field is isolated .",
    "however , if the scalar field is entangled with other fields as considered for instance in @xcite , then a berry phase is measurable . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a scalar field @xmath0 , in the state @xmath1 at the beginning of the @xmath2-th cycle and let @xmath3 be the propagator which maps @xmath4 . if the scalar field s state does not change from one cycle to the other , i.e. @xmath5 , then the bounce produces no observable effects .",
    "however , even though the field is unchanged after one cycle , its state can pick a geometric phase @xmath6 which in principle can be measured as in interferometry .",
    "for instance , for the sake of argument , we consider the simplest case of two scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath7 which are in the entangled state @xmath8 , although our argument can be extended to more complicated cases . after a cycle , because of the berry s phase , the state is a different one @xmath9 .",
    "we argue that this phenomenon is poorly described by analysing , for instance , the particle content coefficients only , in particular if these are calculated perturbatively and can vanish identically , and that a nonperturbative approach is more appropriate for calculating these phases .",
    "we will describe how to define a simple observable in section [ berryphase ] , and we will provide an exact formula for the operator @xmath3 . we will provide both explicit formulae for specific scale factor functions and provide general results for smooth scale factors which are periodic .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ scalarfield ]",
    "we introduce the scalar field in curved spacetime , the settings and the notation , assuming that the universe is cyclic . in section [ partprod ]",
    "we study particle production in the toy model we introduce , both in a kronig - penney approximation and solving numerically the mode equation . in section [ berryphase ]",
    "we study the berry phase .",
    "conclusions follow .",
    "we are interested in the quantum features of a scalar field in a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) space time defined by the metric @xmath10 which describes an evolving isotropic flatspace with a dynamic scale factor @xmath11 . in order to simplify many of the calculations ,",
    "we introduce the conformal time @xmath12 coordinate . in these coordinates ,",
    "the metric reads : @xmath13 ,    \\label{e.metriccoord}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the scale factor in the new coordinate .    as a simplifying assumption",
    ", we consider a scale factor @xmath11 which oscillates according to a local time and that @xmath15 as considered in many nonsingular bouncing cosmology models @xcite , and that can be expanded in fourier series .",
    "we assume that space is locally flat , i.e. that the curvature of space is zero .",
    "in addition to this , we assume that the expansion and contracting phases of the universe last an equal amount of conformal time , which is a scenario ruled out from the physical viewpoint .    in modelling the universe with these features , we were inspired by the two major current theories of bouncing cosmologies : the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite and loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the former has been affected with the recent results from the planck collaboration @xcite , the latter has shown to be a long - living toy model . in general , the ekpyrotic scenario relies on an asymmetric expanding and contracting phases , differently from our case , meanwhile the loop quantum cosmology approach is symmetric in its expanding and contracting phases .",
    "it has been argued however that the ekpyrotic scenario suffers of singularities @xcite .",
    "although violating the tolman principle @xcite , one could claim that a bounce occurring in a quantum gravity scenario might require an extension of the principles of thermodynamics , similarly to what happens for black holes .",
    "thus , in this respect , we are more interested in understanding some of the features of a quantum field when the universe is cyclical .",
    "this simple approach has the advantage that one can carry on several calculations analytically .",

    "however , different solutions of define different mode operators and thus different vacua .",
    "the physical vacuum @xmath31 at a certain conformal time @xmath32 corresponds to the ( instantaneous ) lowest energy state and it is given by the solution of with initial conditions @xmath33 from now on we call @xmath34 the solution of , . at another conformal time @xmath35 , since the vacuum satisfies different initial conditions , the theory has a different particle content described by new creation and annihilation operators @xmath36 .",
    "the mode operators at @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are independent on @xmath42 and defined by @xmath43}{2i}~ ,    \\\\    \\beta_k^ * & = \\frac{w[\\phi_k(\\eta,\\eta_1 ) , \\phi_k(\\eta,\\eta_0)]}{2i}~ ,    \\label{bogocoeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath44=(\\partial_\\eta x)y - x(\\partial_\\eta y)$ ] the wronskian .",
    "the new vacuum is related to the old one via @xmath45 when @xmath46 and @xmath47 the above transformation defines the operator @xmath3 which maps the state of the @xmath2th cycle to the next one . in the following sections we study the vacuum in a bouncing universe , discussing the possible creation of particles and the occurrence of a geometric phase after one or more periods .",
    "in a bouncing universe the scale factor of the universe oscillates . if one assumes a conformally coupled scalar field , the effect of gravity is included in the @xmath42-dependent frequency @xmath48 through the mass of the scalar field , which is periodic with a certain conformal period @xmath49 .",
    "as it can be expected , in general the particle content at conformal times @xmath42 and @xmath50 is the not the same . in this section",
    "we show that the low - energy vacua at different periods are not the same in general , i.e. @xmath51 , even though the functions @xmath34 and @xmath52 satisfies the same differential equation .",
    "we consider the universe in its ground state at conformal time @xmath32 .",
    "as discussed before , an observer at a different conformal time @xmath35 sees different particles which are related to the original ones by the bogoliubov transformation . for instance let us call @xmath53-particles the particles created by the operators @xmath54 at conformal time @xmath32 and @xmath55-particles the ones created by @xmath56 at conformal time @xmath35 .",
    "the vacuum state at @xmath35 is the one annihilated by @xmath57 so , by definition , the number of @xmath55-particles in @xmath58 is exactly zero .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath58 contains many pairs of @xmath53-particles and the average density of @xmath53-particles in @xmath58 is @xcite : @xmath59 where in the second equality we used . for instance , for sudden transitions between two instantaneous vacua ,",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients are given by @xmath60 therefore if the universe is cyclic and performs a sudden transition from @xmath32 to @xmath61 , then @xmath62 so the particle content is not changed . on the other hand , when the universe evolves smoothly the bogoliubov coefficients are obtained by means of from the solution of the differential equation .",
    "the equation is known in the literature as the hill equation and has many interesting properties @xcite . in particular , because of floquet theorem , all the solutions of can be written as @xmath63 where the functions @xmath64 are periodic , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are called the floquet exponents .",
    "the coefficients @xmath67 describing the mode function are readily obtained by imposing , whereas @xmath66 depends on @xmath68 and , in general , can be real , complex or integer . when @xmath66 is complex the solutions are not stable , i.e. they diverge for @xmath69 .",
    "we argue that this is not a physical occurrence so we skip the discussion of this eventuality . more interestingly , when @xmath66 is an integer ( or a fraction ) the solution is periodic of period @xmath49 ( or a multiple of @xmath49 ) . in this case , not only the geometry , but also the quantum fields display a cyclic dynamics during the evolution , so @xmath70 . from the mathematical point of view , @xmath48 can be designed to allow for periodic solutions @xcite for each value of @xmath71 , but typically , for physical conformal factors , the periodic solutions appear only for specific discrete values of the parameters , e.g. for some specific values of @xmath71",

    ". we will discuss below these possibilities for some particular cases .",
    "the equation for the modes of a bouncing universe are formally similar to those of bloch electrons in a spatially periodical lattice , where the space dimension is the conformal time . instead of @xmath77 for @xmath68 , we now have a relativistic energy given by @xmath78 , with the periodicity encoded within @xmath79 .",
    "one can thus use a similar approach to those of used for tunneling of electrons from one lattice site to the other , or for calculating the bands of a solid . in this section",
    "we will assume for simplicity a scale factor which oscillates as : @xmath80 as @xmath81 is merely a redefinition of time , we consider @xmath82 hereon .",
    "we note that this toy model requires @xmath83 for a regular cosmology in which the scale factor never reaches zero . for this model , we find that the conformal time @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 refers to the integer part , which is everywhere continuous and monotonic , allowing for @xmath87 to be inverted @xmath88 . from this",
    "we obtain a closed formula for @xmath14 given by : @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to show that the cyclicity of this universe depends on the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath55 , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 . from now on",
    ", we will assume @xmath94 .",
    "in what follows , we will assume also that our potential can be approximated by step functions .",
    "in particular , we would like to treat the effective potential @xmath95 as a a 2-valued function , as in the konig - penney approximation for electrons on a bloch lattice . in the standard case of a scalar field in a potential with many local minima ,",
    "as shown in @xcite the field can move through tunnelings from one local minimum to another . in our case instead , the interpretation is different , as the potential is now driven by an external factor , i.e. the bounce of the universe .",
    "this will allow to treat the modes close to the bouncing and contracting phases of this toy universe as a constant , and thus the local solution being a plane waves .",
    "an example of this approximation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : kronigpenney ] .",
    "we use a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) approach , i.e. , the energy is approximated by @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the low and high energy regimes , with @xmath98 being the local bounce , meanwhile @xmath99 being the local time of the maximum expansion , and the time of the switch at half maximum , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are defined by the two ( locally in each cycle ) solutions of the equation for @xmath42 : @xmath102 in which the smaller solution is @xmath103 , and the larger given by @xmath104 , denoting the transition from the bounce to the maximum expansion and viceversa , respectively .",

    "we plot both the real and approximated versions of the effective potential . ]    for each mode @xmath71 , we solve the contact equation at each transition point , from one bounce to the other one , imposing the continuity and differentiability of the solution .",
    "if @xmath108 is the solution within at the @xmath2-th bounce , and @xmath109 at the @xmath110-th bounce , one can use a transfer matrix approach for calculating the transition coefficients . if @xmath111 is the wavefunction in the contracting phase , one can write the contact equations between the various solutions at @xmath112 : @xmath113 and if one expands the various terms in fourier modes : @xmath114 as a result of eqns ( [ eq : contact ] ) , one can write a matricial equation :    @xmath115    in general , the transfer matrix is a rotation due to bloch theorem , @xmath116 , and in particular each element is the wronskian between the two solutions : @xmath117 & w[\\phi_n , \\phi_{n+1}^\\dagger ] \\\\",

    "an analytical result can be obtained ( see appendix [ sectfluquet ] for a full derivation ) , showing that wavelengths at which berry s phase is zero can be enumerated and given by : @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath49 is the length of a cycle measured in conformal time .",
    "these wavelengths contain information on the life cycle of the universe as eqn .",

    "the relative berry s phase can then be measured , e.g. , with @xmath212 .",
    "although simplified , our argument shows that the berry s phase can have measurable effects when the field is coupled to other external degrees of freedom .",
    "in the preceding sections we have tried to keep the discussion as general as possible .",
    "in fact , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : phasezero ] ) applies to any scale factor which is periodic in conformal time . in this section",
    ", we will calculate the berry phase using the effective loop quantum cosmology equations for a closed universe .",
    "we start by introducing the standard friedmann equations in a genericmatter - dominated universe for @xmath213 in the dust approximation , in which @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the first friedmann equation becomes @xcite : @xmath216 and if for simplicity we consider the case @xmath217 , then it is a known fact that the scale factor takes the form @xmath218 .",
    "inevitably , such equation describes a universe in which also a big bang is present , as dynamically the scale factor eventually becomes zero at values of conformal time @xmath219 .",
    "these equations describe a universe in which there is a maximum expansion ( the big crunch ) , followed by a recollapse .",
    "it is a widely accepted idea that during the recollapse phase , when the linear size of the scale factor is of the order of the planck length , quantum gravity phenomena take place @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is one example in which a bounce due to quantum corrections occurs .",
    "after the bounce , a new expansion phase is recovered , and thus it is possible to observe a cyclic dynamics of the scale factor .",
    "thus , the machinery we have developed can be applied to the case of loop quantum cosmology if considering purely semiclassical friedmann equations .    here",
    "we consider the effective corrected equations derived in a recent paper @xcite , where eqn .",
    "( [ eq : crunch ] ) is corrected by a term which contains a quantum gravitational term @xmath220 in general , equations of the type above strongly depend on the details of the quantization procedure , but the phenomenology described is well captured by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lqc1 ] ) , which differs in the exact values of @xmath221 . the effective model of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : lqc1 ] agrees with other quantization procedures @xcite up to higher orders in the quantization procedure , but differs from well known results in the field @xcite .",
    "another important comment to be made here is that the derivatives with respect to  time \" , are now with respect to an external scalar field which takes the role of a clock , which is a standard procedure in quantum gravity approaches @xcite . notwithstanding these important remarks and without going into the merit of the quantization procedure ,",
    "the dynamical interpretation of equation ( [ eqn : lqc1 ] ) is clear : at large scale factor , matter forces the universe to recollapse , meanwhile at scale factors comparable to the planck length , the quantum regime kicks in , forcing the universe to re - expand .",
    "this beautiful and appealing picture is the mechanism for which the singularity of the big bang is avoided , and which we considered in this paper insofar in a stylized manner . in order to proceed with our calculations",
    ", we need to recast the eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lqc1 ] ) into a form which is explicitly solvable as a function of the conformal time @xmath42 .",

    ", we can in fact use the semiclassical method described in the body of this paper , and evaluate the berry phase numerically after each cycle .",
    "we stress that the berry phase can be observed only if the dynamics of quantum wave function of the scalar field is cyclic .",
    "this implies that depending on the parameters @xmath221 and @xmath224 , we have to check whether the particle content of the universe is negligible . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqc1 ] we plot from the top to the bottom , the scale factor , the particle content and the berry phase respectively obtained numerically for the case @xmath225 , i.e. when the density of the universe is smaller but comparable to the effective density due to lqc corrections .",
    "we observe that the particle content @xmath226 due to the smooth bounce . in this case",

    ", we observe a high particle content , which although invalidating the calculation of the berry phase , implies that the scalar field carries information through the bounce in the form of particles .",
    "this picture might seem to differ however from the results obtained in ( @xcite ) , where it has been shown that the dynamics has effectively no memory from the previous process . as a first comment",
    ", it is worth to note in @xcite it has been discussed that although similar , the polymeric quantization differs from the standard harmonic oscillator quantization used here .",
    "moreover , our analysis relies on the existence of a spectator scalar field which is quantized in a standard way , and is forced ( parametrically ) by the dynamics of the scale factor .",

    "specifically , it may be possible to generalize recent techniques @xcite , where the transition between quantum to classical behavior is explicitly discussed , to the case of loop quantum gravity .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the quantum features of scalar field both in cyclic and bouncing toy universes , and in the case of loop quantum cosmology effective friedman equations . among the many alternatives to the inflaton field",
    ", there are many approaches in which the universe is considered cyclic . among these , we mentioned loop quantum cosmology and the ekpyrotic string approach .",
    "our motivation was to understand whether a scalar field does hold memory of the previous bounces in subsequent ones , thus changing the physics at each bounce .",
    "we studied the particle content after many bounces in a general manner , and observed numerically that even when the ground state is periodic , and hence there are no particles after one cycle , the universe keeps track of its history via a non - zero berry phase .",
    "we argue that this is potentially a physically - relevant phenomenon if the scalar field is entangled , and have provided general arguments why such phases should be expected for more general , periodic evolutions of the conformal factor of the universe . as a result of our analysis ,",
    "we have observed within various approximations , as for instance the kronig - penney and the case of mathieus approximation , the presence of particles , and noted that in cases where the particle content present at each new bounce is negligible , one can reliably observe the presence of a berry phase .",
    "in fact , after having introduced a differential equation describing the berry s connection as function of time , we have obtained a numerical solution of the berry s phase , showing that this is non - zero for our toy model , but providing a general framework , based on the fourier expansion of the energy of the scalar field , for calculating it perturbatively .",
    "we have observed that when the ground state is cyclic , for a particular mode , one can observe a non - zero berry s phase .",
    "in addition to this , we have observed that values for which the berry phase are zero , contain information on the @xmath232 norm of the scale factor of the universe over the cycle .",
    "this gauge - invariant phase is of geometrical origin and provides a unified framework to explain important observable phenomena like the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "being a measurable quantity , a non - zero berry s phase can provide a figure of merit to demonstrate that the universe is cyclic .",
    "this phase becomes physically relevant if the scalar field is entangled to another field which can be measured . in this case , after each bounce the physical state of the system changes , and thus the physics changes as well .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we worked initially within the framework of a toy model and thus there are some further limitations to this approach .",
    "first of all , we have considered modes which cross the bouncing phase without any new physics to intervene , as for instance quantum gravity .",
    "the paper does not describe that phase , and treats the universe as a smoothly oscillating ball .",
    "yet , we believe that this phenomenon is interesting _ per se _ from the theoretical standpoint , as also for generic fourier expansions of the scale factor a non - zero berry s phase was observed . in the second part of this paper , we applied these ideas to the case of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , where a description of the quantum phase of these oscillations is provided .",
    "also , an extra appeal of this approach for the present paper is that in lqc the quantum description is very close to the classical one , and thus we do not require the use of a full quantum gravitational approach . in the case of lqc , we find that for the case of a specific semiclassical friedman equations for which there are oscillations of the scale factor , one can observe two specific regimes . in the first regime ,",
    "in which the effective quantum density is comparable to the density of the universe at @xmath233 , we observed numerically small particle content and non - zero berry phase . in the other regime ,",
    "in which the quantum effective density is much higher than the density of the universe , one observes non - negligible particle content .",
    "our results are general enough to be considered in other cases in details .",
    "in fact , given the standard quantization procedure of the scalar field , we have considered the case in which the only requirement is that the scale factor has a fourier expansion .",
    "we studied some specific cases , but used known relations for the hill equation , which underlies the evolution of the modes of the scalar field .",
    ".in addition to the remarks above , nothing prevents this same analysis to be repeated in the case of particles with spin other than zero , which are far more common than scalar particles . as a final remark",
    ", we stress that there are other ways in which a berry s phase could be originated for non - cyclic cosmologies .",
    "this is the case , for instance , if the scalar field undergoes a quantum phase transition in the early universe @xcite and as shown in @xcite for inflationary models as well .",
    "we would like to thank lorenzo sindoni and alessandra gnecchi for comments on an earlier draft of this paper , and to mercedes martin - benito and edward wilson - ewig for helping us and guiding through the results in loop quantum cosmology in a revised version of this article .",

    "it is easy to see that for certain values of @xmath262 s , @xmath201 is ill - defined .",
    "these are all the values of @xmath71 for which @xmath262 takes an integer value @xmath2 ; an easy calculation shows that these values are given by @xmath263 .",
    "since we are in the approximation in which @xmath204 , we must have : @xmath264=\\pi*\\{2n-\\frac{m^2 e}{4\\pi n^2},\\frac{m^2 e}{4\\pi n^2}\\}$ ] . of these phases , we disregard @xmath265 as this violates the condition we started from .",
