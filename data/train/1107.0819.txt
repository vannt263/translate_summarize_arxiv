    "nanoscale structures involving normal ( n ) , ferromagnet ( f ) and superconductor ( s ) junctions , the so - called heterostructures , involve interplay of superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters providing a novel opportunity to study the influence of the spin degree of freedom on transport and thermodynamic properties of such systems .",
    "a paradigmatic example is represented by the normal metal ( n)/superconducting ( s ) bilayer . in this system the sub - gap transmission of an electron propagating from the n - side towards the s - side is forbidden due to the absence of available electronic states within the superconducting gap .",
    "thus , in order to conserve the charge current , a propagating cooper pair is transmitted in the superconductor , while an hole is reflected in the normal metal .",
    "this anomalous reflection , described by the pioneering work of andreev@xcite , has been successively described by blonder _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite in the language of scattering theory ( the so - called btk theory ) .",
    "differently from methods based on the transfer hamiltonian formalism ( thf ) , the btk scattering approach does not assume weak coupling approximation and allows to study transport in ns heterostructures from the metallic ( high transparency of the interface ) up to the tunneling limit ( low transparency ) .",
    "in the tunneling limit , the agreement between btk theory and the green s function approach shows that , in the absence of many - body correlations , a scattering theory is extremely suitable for studying transport in heterostructures avoiding time - consuming methods .",
    "almost ten years after the btk formulation , a development for f / s interfaces based on a btk - like theory able to describe the andreev reflection physics within the scattering approach appeared@xcite .",
    "a further improvement of the original btk formalism has been successively brought out by anantram _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite who reformulated the btk theory in terms of the scattering field theory@xcite ( bsft ) originally conceived by bttiker@xcite for mesoscopic ( normal ) systems .",
    "the formalism provides a clear correspondence between physical observables and the scattering matrix of the system within a second quantization formalism , avoiding the by - hand construction characterizing some parts of the btk theory@xcite .",
    "the anantram and datta work@xcite is based on a two - component spinorial bogoliubov - de gennes@xcite theory ( as in the original btk theory ) which is a convenient representation in the analysis of spin conserving processes .",
    "however , recently , the need to explore the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism stimulated the realization of magnetic superconducting heterostructures . in the simplest case of a ferromagnetic",
    "f / s bilayer@xcite , the bulk magnetization of the f - side can differ from the one at the interface and spin flipping phenomena can take place at the f / s junction . in order to fully describe",
    "the physics of the magnetic superconducting heterostructures one needs to generalize the bdg formalism to a four - component spinorial representation . to the best of our knowledge , a scattering field theory _ a la _ bttiker for magnetic superconducting heterostructures which properly treat spin active phenomena at the interface is not yet available and our work aims to fill such vacancy . in particular , the second quantized form of the btk theory offers important advantages in obtaining non - local quantum properties ( i.e. correlation functions ) which are not provided by the btk theory .",

    "the second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the spin polarized transport in a spin - valve system by the developed formalism .",
    "in particular , we focus on the evidence of the andreev reflection in the subgap transport at varying the magnetic interaction and on the quantum size effects due to the interlayer width to make a link to experimental observations . among the transport properties ,",
