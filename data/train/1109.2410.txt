    "we note that , since the phonon excitation occurs without spin flipping , i.e. , in the hilbert space of zero total spin , the energy positions of the spin - induced phonon excitations are different from those of spin excitations shown in  [ sp ] . both the high- and low - energy changes predominantly occur near @xmath156 , which is due to the nature of spin - phonon coupling as shown in appendix .",

    "in addition , new spin - assisted phonon structures appear at low - energy region .",
    "the fact that the strong modification occurs near @xmath156 is understood by taking into account the momentum dependence of the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the effect of spin - phonon coupling on inelastic neutron scattering has been discussed so far in literature .",
    "@xcite however , there is no work demonstrating the intensity distributions for the spin - peierls model as far as we know .",
    "therefore , we believe that the present results will be helpful for analyzing inelastic neutron scattering data in spin - phonon coupled systems .    in cugeo@xmath1 , inelastic neutron scattering experiments have clearly revealed the presence of both lowest - energy branch of spin excitation with strong intensity and multi - spinon continuum .",
    "@xcite this is consistent with the results of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model .",
    "experimental data has also shown high - energy structures above the continuum .",
    "if the structures are originated from spin degrees of freedom , they may be due to the coupling with phonon .",
    "it is desired to resolve the structure into phonon and spin components by either detailed analyses of momentum dependence of their intensity or new polarized inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
