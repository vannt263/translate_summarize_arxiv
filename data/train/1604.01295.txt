    "<S> we report an experimental test of single - shot polarimetry applied to the problem of real - time monitoring of the output polarization states in each core within a multicore fiber bundle . </S>",
    "<S> the technique uses a stress - engineered optical element together with an analyzer and provides a point spread function whose shape unambiguously reveals the polarization state of a point source . </S>",
    "<S> we implement this technique to monitor , simultaneously and in real time , the output polarization states of up to 180 single mode fibers cores in both conventional and polarization - maintaining fiber bundles . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate also that the technique can be used to fully characterize the polarization properties of each individual fiber core including eigen - polarization states , phase delay and diattenuation .    </S>",
    "<S> multicore fiber ( mcf ) are important for a broad range of applications spanning over the fields of telecommunication @xcite , high power fiber lasers @xcite and medical endoscopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently there has been a growing interest for coherent beam combining @xcite using mcfs both in the fields of broadband laser amplification @xcite and lens - free endoscopy @xcite . in coherent beam combining , </S>",
    "<S> an initial laser beam is , spectrally and/or spatially , split into @xmath0 beamlets that are launched and propagate into the @xmath0 individual cores of a mcf . at the exit of the bundle </S>",
    "<S> , the different beamlets are recombined in a single beam and their relative phases are adjusted by a servo for coherent synthesis of an amplified ultrashort pulse or a focused spot , depending the application . </S>",
    "<S> optimal temporal and/or spatial , focus at the bundle output requires to actively manage the relative beamlet phase and group delay @xcite together with their polarization state . </S>",
    "<S> recent works report the use of polarization - maintaining @xmath1 mcf @xcite to ensure that the output beamlets exhibit identical polarization states for optimal spectral and/or spatial interference . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , accurate core - by - core polarization state characterizations have not yet been carried out , neither the relative stability of these states during a fiber bend or twist . </S>",
    "<S> such monitoring is important for calibration purposes and to infer the polarization origin of output power evolutions during fiber bends . </S>",
    "<S> ideally one would like to monitor in real time the polarization state at the output of 10 to @xmath210000 fiber cores constituting the fiber bundle of interest . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite challenging since standard polarimetry imaging techniques usually require time - sequential operations such as , for instance , analyzing the intensity of the light passing through a rotating quarter wave plate and a fixed polarizer @xcite . single shot polarimetry imaging has been also reported where the wavefront is divided and directed to different sensors @xcite , or where a clever combination of savart plates is used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these single shot operations come with a significant technical complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) ) , for ( c ) horizontal , ( d ) linear at @xmath3 , ( e ) right - hand circular , ( f ) vertical , ( g ) linear at @xmath4 , ( f ) left - hand circular polarization states , where a representation of the polarization is overlaid with blue indicating linear polarization , and green and red indicating right- or left - handedness . ]    a method of polarimetry was recently demonstrated that can infer complete polarization information using single - exposure images of discrete point - like light sources using an optical window subjected to stress with trigonal symmetry @xcite . this stress - engineered optical ( seo ) element @xcite provides , near the window s center fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , a retardance that increases linearly with the radius and an orientation of the fast axis that precesses with the azimuth fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the seo can be viewed as a spatially - varying wave plate : each point over the cross section of the test beam experiences a different combination of retardance and orientation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a collimated beam passing through the desired section of the seo ( the rest being blocked ) acquires an intricate polarization structure @xcite that , when observed at the focus of a lens , and after passing through a left - handed circular analyzer ( lhca ) , provides a point spread function ( psf ) whose shape unambiguously reveals the polarization state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c - f ) shows measured psfs at the focal plane for the standard six reference polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in @xcite , the psf is a linear function of the stokes parameter vector , so the state of polarization ( including how polarized or unpolarized the light is ) can be inferred from the measured psf in real time , without the need for sequential measurements . </S>",
    "<S> zimmerman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite described how an extension of this principle allows one to capture polarization information from an image sampled by a pinhole array by placing the seo in the pupil ( fourier conjugate ) plane .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we report on using seo polarimetric imaging to monitor in real time the polarization state at the output of a mcf . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the polarization state evolution when the fiber bundle is illuminated with rotating linear polarization states and retrieve , for each fiber core , the equivalent phase plate . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the stability of the output polarization state when the mcf is slightly bent .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) shows a schematic of the optical setup . </S>",
    "<S> a pulsed ytterbium laser ( t - pulse , amplitude systemes , 1030  nm , 50  mhz , 1  w ) is controlled in polarization by using a polarizer and a half wave plate . the laser beam is then weakly focused to illuminate the entrance facet of the tested mcf . </S>",
    "<S> the output mcf facet is imaged onto a cmos camera after crossing a seo element ( placed at a fourier conjugate plane ) and a left - handed circular analyzer ( composed of a quarter wave plate and a polarizer ) . </S>",
    "<S> two fused silica mcfs are considered in this work ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b - c ) ) , the first one consisting of 19 polarization - maintaining ( pm - mcf ) single mode fiber cores ( pitch 40  @xmath5 m , core diameter 18  @xmath5 m , outer diameter 348  @xmath5 m , length 50 cm ) , the second one ( mcf ) made up of 475 non - pm single mode fiber cores ( pitch 15.3  @xmath5 m , core diameter 3.1  @xmath5 m , outer diameter 421  @xmath5 m , length 30 cm ) . both mcfs exhibit very low cross talk , below -30  db and were held straight during the measurements .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6=25  mm , mcf multi core fiber , lenses @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent a set of lenses that image the fiber face onto the camera with a magnification of ~13x , seo stress - engineered optical element , qwp quarter wave plate , lhca left - handed circular analyzer ( b ) 19 cores pm single mode mcf ; ( c ) 475 cores non - pm single mode mcf ; scale bar : 100  @xmath5 m . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the system is calibrated by taking images with unpolarized illumination of the fiber input ( or with the sum of images with two orthogonal illumination polarizations ) and where polarizers are used after the fiber to create the six reference psfs for all cores , such as those shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c - h ) for one core . by then performing a linear fit of the psf for each core with the corresponding reference psfs </S>",
    "<S> , one can determine the stokes parameters . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) shows an image of the seo psfs ( grey scale ) obtained when illuminating 8 cores of the pm - mcf with linearly polarized light aligned along one of the pm - mcf principal axes . </S>",
    "<S> note that the pm - mcf input facet was illuminated with a quasi - plane wave , without special core coupling optimization . </S>",
    "<S> overlaid on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) are the output polarization ellipses ( as directly deduced from the seo recorded psfs of @xmath9 pixels each ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that these outputs are all approximately vertically polarized , a result consistent with the aligned linear polarized illumination and the pm characteristics of this mcf . </S>",
    "<S> the movie in visualization 1 shows the same images for several linear input polarizations ( rotating the hwp in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , two linear output polarizations are obtained when the pm - mcf is illuminated with linearly polarized input light along two orthogonal directions ( close to 0   and 90   ) . </S>",
    "<S> visualization 1 also shows the trajectories over the poincar sphere of the output polarization states corresponding to the 8 cores . </S>",
    "<S> these paths are all approximately great circles ( that is paths that draw the largest circle on the poincar sphere ) , and this indicates that each core behaves like a phase plate . </S>",
    "<S> this phase - plate - like behavior is represented pictorially in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , where on each core , we overlay its two eigen - polarizations ( solid and dashed lines ) . the angle traced by the orange arc corresponds to the phase delay between these two eigen - polarizations states and its handedness ( right and left ) is represented by the colours green and red </S>",
    "<S> . as expected , the two eigen - polarizations are mostly linear and oriented along two orthogonal axis on this pm - mcf . </S>",
    "<S> note that since the jones matrices are not perfectly unitary , the eigen polarizations might not be exactly orthogonal . as for the phase delay , it arises from the differential phase between the two eigen - polarization that has been accumulated during the propagation along the fiber length and this is indeed expected to vary from core to core .    </S>",
    "<S> m. also see visualization 1 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now move to the non - pm 475 cores mcf , that we denote mcf for simplicity . here again the mcf facet is illuminated with a quasi - plane wave without special care to optimize core coupling . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](a ) shows the recorded seo psfs ( grey scale ) ,  @xmath10 pixels each , together with the overlaid output polarization states for 180 cores , when the mcf is illuminated with vertically polarized light . as in the previous case , </S>",
    "<S> green and red ellipses represent right - handedness and left - handedness , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the pm - mcf , there are no apparent correlations in core to core output polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> the movie in visualization 2 shows the same images when rotating the linear input polarizations , together with the trajectories over the poincar sphere of the output polarization states corresponding to each core . as previously , </S>",
    "<S> the paths follow approximately great circles over the poincar sphere surface indicating that each core acts as a phase plate . using this polarimetric information , we represent in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) the two eigen - polarizations associated to each core , together with the phase delay ( orange arc ) between them . as previously , for each core , the underlying unpolarized transmitted intensity is also shown ( grey scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> careful inspection of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) reveals correlation between core to core eigen - polarization axis . </S>",
    "<S> this residual anisotropy probably comes from the stress present in the mcf preform and is a direct result of its fabrication process . </S>",
    "<S> as in the pm - mcf case the phase delay between the two eigen - polarization shows no core to core correlation and comes from the phase accumulated during propagation .    </S>",
    "<S> m. also see visualization 2 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> our seo - based polarimetric measurement can also address diattenuation in each fiber core , an effect related to the differential propagation loss arising between the two eigen - polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) where the measured diattenuation is indicated by the size of the second ( dashed ) eigen - polarization ellipse relative to the non - dashed one ( when diattenuation is absent the sizes of the dashed and non - dashed ellipse are the same ) . when diattenuation is present , the output polarization state trajectory is no longer a great circle over the poincar sphere as the input polarization is varied and describes a great circle trajectory over the poincar sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the seo based polarimetry imaging allows then the full characterization of each core as a jones matrix , whose pictorial representation in terms of eigen - polarizations , diattenuation and relative phase is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally investigate the influence of a slight twist or bend on the fiber core output polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> we take here full advantage of our single shot polarimetric measurement by recording video rate images of the seo psfs for 180 illuminated cores while bending the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> visualization 3 shows 180 seo psfs ( grey scale ) and the associated output polarization states when the mcf is illuminated with vertically polarized light and manually wiggled and slightly bent ( radius of curvature approximately 10  cm over a fiber length of few cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> visualization 4 shows the applied manual wiggling and bending . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a ) shows the seo psfs where we have selected four cores and display their trajectories over the poincar sphere fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](b ) while applying manual bending . </S>",
    "<S> visualization 5 shows a movie of the same . </S>",
    "<S> quite surprisingly , the output polarization states are weakly affected by the bend suggesting that the phase delay accumulated along propagation between the two eigen - polarization states remains fairly constant in the case of wiggles and slight bends . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates that seo polarimetric imaging can monitor in real time the polarization state at the output of a mcf having a very large number of cores . </S>",
    "<S> +    m. see visualizations 3 - 5 for movies of the same . ]    in conclusion , we have described and tested a method of single shot polarimetry @xcite applied to the characterization of two different types of multicore fiber ( mcf ) . using a stress - engineered optical element followed by an analyzer , we can simultaneously retrieve the polarization states of the light emitted by a large number of fiber cores simply by looking at the individual images of the cores at the focus of a lens . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is real - time and we have shown that it allows the full polarization characterization of each fiber core . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is interesting for applications such as coherent beam combining in mcfs where the output polarization in each core has to be identical . </S>",
    "<S> it also opens new directions in the field of lens - free endoscopy @xcite where performing polarimetric imaging together with full polarization and phase control at the mcf output gives access to the full vector psf control , in a way similar to what has been done in microscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would open the door for important new avenues in endoscopy including structural molecular and biological imaging @xcite . </S>"
