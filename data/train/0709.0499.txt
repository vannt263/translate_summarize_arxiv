    "the development of methods for trapping atoms and cooling them to ultralow temperatures has launched the new field of _ cold atom physics_. among the dramatic achievements in this field have been the creation of _ bose - einstein condensates _ of bosonic atoms and _ superfluids _ of fermionic atoms . at the low temperatures at which these phenomena occur , the de broglie wavelengths of the atoms are much larger than their sizes or the ranges of their interactions .",
    "this makes the behavior of the atoms insensitive to many of the details of atomic structure and interatomic interactions .",
    "the atoms can be treated as point particles and their interactions can be described very accurately by simple models .",
    "one class of models that is particularly convenient for describing ultracold atoms is _ scattering models_. scattering models are formulated in terms of parameters that describe the low - energy scattering of atoms .",
    "the simplest example is the _ zero - range model _ whose only interaction parameter in the 2-body sector is the _ s - wave scattering length_. the scattering length is the most important interaction parameter governing the behavior of cold atoms .",
    "the primary advantage of scattering models for describing cold atoms is that their parameters are directly related to physical observables at the relevant energy scale .",
    "another advantage of scattering models is that there are many useful models that can be solved analytically in the 2-body sector .",
    "there are very few analytic results on the 3-body and higher @xmath0-body problem , but having an analytic solution to the 2-body problem is a great simplification in the numerical solution of higher few - body problems .",
    "the analytic solution of the 2-body problem is also useful in the many - body problem , because interaction effects in low - density systems of atoms are dominated by 2-body interactions .",
    "a particularly convenient class of scattering models is ones with _",
    "local interactions_. in these models , atoms interact with each other only when they are at the same point in space .",
    "such a simplified representation of the interactions for cold atoms is useful because the large de broglie wavelengths of the atoms makes them insensitive to the range of interatomic interactions . as a consequence",
    ", the low - energy behavior of the atoms can be described to a good approximation by zero - range interactions .    a scattering model with local interactions can be described by a _ local quantum field",
    "theory_. a formulation in terms of a quantum field theory is useful because the same framework describes the 2-body , higher few - body , and many - body problems . quantum field theories with local interaction terms are particularly convenient , because theoretical methods for dealing with such theories are well developed .",
    "much of the stimulus for this development has come from the success of local relativistic quantum field theories in describing elementary particles .",
    "one of the complications of local quantum field theories is that they are inherently singular at short distances , but this problem can be handled using the machinery of _",
    "renormalization_.    in this review , we present a unified treatment of scattering models that can be used to describe the low - energy behavior of atoms or other nonrelativistic particles with short - range interactions .",
    "we restrict our attention for the most part to bosons with the same mass and with s - wave interactions only .",
    "the extensions to fermions , to particles with different masses , and to interactions in higher angular momentum channels are straightforward using the formalism of quantum field theory . in the simplest scattering models ,",
    "the only degrees of freedom are atoms that are all in the same spin state .",
    "we also consider scattering models whose degrees of freedom include atoms in other spin states or diatomic molecules .",
    "we define the physical parameters of each scattering model by specifying the s - wave phase shift for the spin state of primary interest .",
    "we formulate the model as a local quantum field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "the renormalizations that relate the coupling constants of the quantum field theory to the physical parameters of the scattering model are determined . the green s function that describes the evolution of a 2-atom system",
    "is derived analytically .",
    "it is used to determine the t - matrix elements for atom - atom scattering and the binding energies of diatomic molecules .",

    "in this section , we describe the _ fundamental theory _ that provides an extremely accurate description of atoms with energies small compared to the splitting between the ground state of the atom and its first electronic excitation . to be specific , we focus on alkali atoms .",
