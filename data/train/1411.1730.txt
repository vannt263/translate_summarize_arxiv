    "the excursions around a mean period suggest a pulsation related cause rather than a secular change due to evolution .    there is a third group of 15 stars ( vz  cma , gh  car , v419  cen , bg  cru , v1334  cyg , v526  mon , qz  nor , v440  per , ek  pup , my  pup , v335  pup , v950  sco , ah  vel , fz  car , and az  cen ; fig .  5 in berdnikov et  al . ) which have no pattern in the photometric @xmath0 residuals",
    ". this may be because the data series are not long enough , or the values are not accurate enough or in many cases the gaps between the times of observation obscure any correlation .",
    "it is likely that at least some of these have period jitter , possibly at a lower level and over a longer time scale than the more prominent fluctuations in the first two groups .    in summary",
    ", the photometric monitoring of these 29 overtone pulsators shows that nearly half of them have period variation .",
    "this includes the second group showing substantial period jitter .",
    "thus on the scale of decades there is evidence of considerable period variation in overtone pulsators , including both the koen categories of long term change and random period jitter .",
    "the _ most _ observations display two characteristics of pulsation not seen before in less plentiful and less accurate data .",
    "first , the light curves as exhibited by the fourier parameters are more variable in the overtone pulsator sz tau than in the fundamental mode pulsator rt aur . on the other hand , the differences between cycles display a similar pattern as a function of phase ( fig . 6 ) . we have made preliminary explorations for explanations as discussed in the sections below .      the intensive observations of rt  aur and sz  tau with the _ most _ satellite have demonstrated that the overtone pulsator ( sz  tau ) has more instability in its pulsation cycle than the fundamental mode cepheid ( rt  aur ) .",
    "this is apparent in simple repetition of the light curve from cycle to cycle ( figs . 1 and 2 )",
    ", the fourier spectrum of the observations ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , the fourier parameters cycle by cycle ( figs . 5 and 6 ) and the @xmath0 diagrams ( figs . 8 and 9 ) . as a preliminary consideration , we note that the node of a first overtone pulsator occurs higher in the envelope than that of a fundamental mode pulsator .",
    "this may create differences in the pulsation even for stars of reasonably similar period , mass , and temperature .",
    "the quality and quantity of _ most _ and _ kepler _ satellite observations has revealed changes in the periods and light curves of sz  tau and v1154  cyg .",
    "explanations due to evolution , mass loss , and binary light - time effect are not adequate for the nonmonotonic variations as discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "it is suggested that there is an instability in the pulsation itself which is responsible .    in order to check whether turbulent convection in the partial ionization zones can cause cycle - to - cycle light curve variations we computed models with the florida - budapest code ( kollth et al .",
    "we used similar parameters and settings as szab , buchler & bartee ( 2007 ) . to study sz tau we computed an overtone pulsator model , with a mass of 5.25 m@xmath30 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 = 6075 k and solar metallicity .",
    "the model has a linear overtone period of 3.106 days .",
    "figures [ model]a and [ model]b show the variation of the bolometric luminosity and the radii of the topmost layers of the model after reaching its limit cycle corresponding to the radial first overtone mode , respectively . in panel c we plot the turbulent energy as a function of time and zone number ( from 78 to 121 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the turbulent energy is color coded .",
    "this range of zones captures the hydrogen ionization zone featuring the strongest turbulent energy throughout the pulsational cycle , on the order of @xmath48 erg per zone .",
    "the energy is highest where the _ most _ light curve of sz tau shows the largest scatter .",
    "however , the magnitude of the turbulent energy content is negligible compared to the kinetic energy due to the pulsation as is shown in fig .",
    "[ model]d . here",
    "we show the logarithm of the ratio of the turbulent and kinetic energy for each zone as a function of time .",
    "the largest values are attained for the local velocity minima ( for a given mass zone ) , which is the dominant term in this quantity .",
    "the discrepancy is huge , the turbulent energy is 10 - 20 orders of magnitude less than the kinetic energy .",
    "even if the total turbulent energy could be converted to kinetic energy the modulation of the light curve would be still very small .",
    "however , the efficiency of the energy transfer is much lower than 100% , therefore we conclude that  at least in our 1d code  the turbulent convection has a negligible effect in altering the light curve shape from cycle to cycle , although it provides the necessary viscosity to control the amplitude .",
    "we note in passing that buchler , kollth & cadmus ( 2004 ) found a much more significant turbulent energy in rv tauri models .",
    "a logical step in this direction would be the use of multi - dimension hydrocodes , such as mundprecht , muthsam & kupka ( 2013 ) , that would naturally enable the enhancement of turbulent energy or turbulent flux locally ( see their fig .",
    "12 ) as opposed to the zone - averaged quantities in our 1d simulations . however , given the large difference we found between the kinetic and turbulent energies , it is highly questionable whether the required drastic change can occur in these overtone cepheid models .",
    "several causes have been suggested for period variations in cepheids , both fundamental mode pulsators and overtone pulsators :    @xmath49 * evolution * through the instability strip : this is almost certainly responsible for some of the period changes seen . while evolution does not necessarily proceed at a uniform pace ( fernie et  al .",
    "1993 ) , one direction of period change would predominate and result in a parabolic @xmath0 diagram .",
    "@xmath49 * light - time effects * in binary systems : this produces cyclic apparent period changes .",
    "they must , however , be consistent with what is known about the orbit of the system .",
    "possibly the best example is aw  per ( welch & evans 1989 ) .",
    "light - time effect has been suggested to explain the @xmath0 residuals in rt  aur ( turner et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , the velocity variations shown in fig .  [ gamma ] indicate no variation larger than @xmath42 1 kms@xmath36 of the mean .",
    "this implies that an orbital velocity variation has not been observed for data drawn from many different instruments over a long time interval .    as discussed above , a substantial fraction ( 24% ) of overtone pulsators",
    "have period variations characterized by alternate ( though cyclic ) increases and decreases .",
    "light - time effect is the _",
    "one _ explanation for period change which is cyclic , but it is not viable for many of the overtone pulsators because of the scale and erratic nature .",
    "this implies that these quasi - cyclic period variations are caused by something in the pulsation process itself .",
    "@xmath49 * star spots * : neilson and ignace ( 2014 ) have suggested that the period variations of the kepler cepheid v1154 cyg could be produced by a hot spot on the surface caused by convection . in a study of yellow supergiants including several cepheids , percy and kim ( 2014 ) suggest a similar possible cause for amplitude variation , large convection cells causing variation as the star rotates . while starspots could affect the time of maximum light , they would not have a cumulative effect as seen in the @xmath0 diagram .    @xmath49",
    "* mass loss * : this has been suggested , for instance by neilson et  al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) , and worked out in detail .",
    "however , since periods change _ monotonically _ , the quasi - cyclic variations frequently seen in overtone pulsators are not due to mass loss .",
    "we note , however , that the period changes in overtone pulsators discussed in sect .  5 which can reasonably be fit with parabolas all show increasing periods .",
    "this is consistent with mass loss , although it may be only one of several factors .",
    "@xmath49 * pulsation * : amplitude variation in blazhko rr lyr stars is not fully understood , but one possible explanation is that it is produced by high - order resonance ( buchler and kollth 2011 ) . pulsation and excitation of a complicated group of modes may also play a role in cepheid period change .",
    "percy and kim ( 2014 ) suggest that convection may drive pulsation mode excitation and hence amplitude variation , and the same might also affect cepheid periods .",
    "as discussed above , the fact that the level of pulsation instability on both short and long timescales appears to depend on pulsation mode suggests a role for pulsation in period changes",
    ".    the observed period changes may be due to a combination of these factors .",
    "however , the morphology of @xmath0 diagrams , particularly for overtone pulsators , provides some clues .",
    "in particular the high fraction of overtone pulsators which have quasi - cyclic period variations is not consistent with stellar evolution nor mass - loss .",
    "furthermore , the size of the variations is too large to uniquely originate from binary light - time effects .",
    "hence the pulsation process itself is indicated as a cause .",
    "there are three primary results from the _ most _ observations of cepheids",
    ".    @xmath49 the observations of a fundamental mode pulsator ( rt  aur ) and an overtone pulsator ( sz  tau ) find greater instability in the pulsation of the overtone cepheid in the repetition of the light curve and the fourier parameters .",
    "@xmath49 on the other hand , the deviations between cycles for both rt aur and sz tau follow a similar pattern as a function of phase of increase after minimum radius and a return to a smaller value after maximum radius .",
    "@xmath49 the @xmath0 curves indicate that on a time scale of decades , the period changes of the overtone pulsator are more erratic .",
    "thus at both long and short time scales , the period variations of rt  aur ( fundamental mode ) and sz  tau ( overtone mode ) differ , with the overtone mode pulsator exhibiting greater instability at all time scales .",
