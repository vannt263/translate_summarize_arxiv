    "the charged higgs boson carries a distinctive signature of the higgs sector in the models beyond the standard model ( sm ) , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "therefore , its discovery will be an evidence of multi doublet structure of the higgs sector . in the literature ,",
    "the charged higgs decays have been widely studied .",
    "the charged higgs production in hadron colliders was studied in @xcite and more systematic calculations of production process at lhc have been presented in @xcite . at the lhc",

    "they have excluded the regions with light @xmath8 @xcite . at present the model independent lower limit on the charged higgs mass",
    "is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the charged higgs boson decay into tau and neutrino has been analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite and it was shown that the dominate decay modes of the charged higgs boson were @xmath15 and @xmath16 . however , the other candidate for the large branching ratio @xmath17 is the process @xmath18 , and it has been examined in @xcite . the analysis in @xcite was related to the @xmath18 decay , in the framework of the 2hdm , including loop corrections and for some reasonable choice of free parameters , those corrections could be as large as @xmath19 of the tree level result . in @xcite , the chances of detecting charged higgs boson of the mssm at large hadron colliders ( lhc ) , in the @xmath20 mode , have been studied and it was concluded that the charged higgs boson signal overcomes the background for optimum @xmath21 values , between 2 and 3 . in @xcite",
    "the above decay has been analyzed in the mssm and the electroweak ( ew ) corrections have been obtained .",
    "it was observed that , for the low @xmath21 , these corrections caused an enhancement at the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the work in @xcite is devoted to the decays of the charged higgs boson , including the radiative modes into decays @xmath23 and @xmath24 , mostly in the framework of the 2hdm and mssm . in @xcite ,",
