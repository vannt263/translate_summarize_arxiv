    "a blind search has been made for cosmic ray sources of neutral hadrons yielding a peak just above the knee .",
    "we report support for such a possibility , i.e. , a peak at @xmath3 using data from an international collaboration ( tunka).@xcite this search was motivated by a 1999 claim by this author of such a peak at @xmath1@xcite and also some recent results by at least three experiments showing a @xmath2 peak in the all - particle cosmic ray spectrum.@xcite moreover , its existence had been suggested before the first 1999 claim , based on a model@xcite that fit the cosmic ray spectrum , assuming the knee is the threshold for proton beta decay  a process that becomes energetically allowed if the electron neutrino were a tachyon of mass @xmath4 based on an idea proposed by chodos , hauser , and kostelecky.@xcite as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the threshold in pev for proton decay can be written as : @xmath5    furthermore , apart from the peak itself , it is noteworthy that the 1999 cosmic ray spectrum fit ( fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) showed significant oscillations in the region above the knee that match those in a recent report of fine structure in this energy region ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "regretably , that 1999 model did err for the region @xmath6 in failing to include a gzk cut - off.@xcite despite that flaw , the inclusion of a gzk cut - off was not a significant feature of the model .",
    "in fact , had one merely assumed a greater distance for the extragalactic sources that would have accommodated a gzk cut - off without affecting the fit for @xmath7 the one essential feature of the 1999 model was that cosmic ray protons began to decay when @xmath8 resulting in a decay chain : @xmath9 such a decay chain would continue until the baryon s energy drops below @xmath10 thereby giving rise to the knee , and resulting in a pile - up of neutrons just above it , i.e. , a peak at @xmath11@xcite neutrons , being uncharged , mostly point back to their sources , unlike protons whose directions are randomized by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "thus , if the baryon in the decay chain spends most of its time as a neutron most of its directional information should be preserved en route to earth . moreover , the hypothesized decay chain could allow pev neutrons to reach us from sources normally considered too distant , given the neutron lifetime such as cygnus x-3 .",
    "the first claim@xcite for a @xmath12 peak was based on lloyd - evans data for cygnus x-3.@xcite as a binary having an orbital period of 4.79 h , for certain rotation phases jets emanating along the rotation axis of one member of the binary might point towards earth and increase the observed signal , which is what the lloyd - evans data seemed to show .",
    "in fact , the reported signal was seen by selecting events in a particular @xmath13 wide phase window , and using as background the remaining @xmath14 .",
    "if the signal was real , such a phase window cut would reduce background by a factor as much as 40 , greatly enhancing the signal . using",
    "the lloyd - evans data ehrlich showed that the two bins straddling @xmath15 had @xmath16 excess events ( @xmath17).@xcite apart from skepticism of this claim , there is also much skepticism about the existence of cygnus x-3 as a source of pev cosmic rays .",
    "however , the basis of that skepticism may be poorly justified , especially if cygnus x-3 is an episodic source , and if a weak @xmath18 signal needs cuts to suppress background , as discussed in more detail in appendix i.",
    "recent support for a cosmic ray peak just above the spectrum knee can be found in data reported by the tunka collaboration , even though the authors characterize their observation instead as an example of a  remarkable fine structure \" seen above the knee in the all - particle cosmic ray spectrum.@xcite nevertheless , fig . 1 of their paper does show an unambiguous peak at @xmath19 in the combined tunka-25 and tunka-133 data .",
    "one might well be suspicious in any peak that occurs just at an energy where the spectra from the two data sets join on the other hand , it is quite significant that fig . 1 of their paper shows data from three other experiments that exhibit the same peak as tunka ( kascade grande , ice top , and tibet).@xcite the tunka authers interpret the fine structure above the knee as being quite consistent with a combined source model ( galactic sn remnants plus extragalactic source(s ) ) , with a suitable choice of free parameters .",
    "however , the authors do not consider an alternative hypotheses that can also account for the observed  remarkable fine structure \" ( including the @xmath19 peak )  in particular they do not mention the 1999 prediction and subsequent observation of just such a peak previously predicted and then observed at @xmath20 in what follows , we present an independent analysis of the tunka-133 data , which seeks corroborating evidence for such a peak by attempting to find possible cosmic ray sources in a blind all - sky survey .",
    "we have no knowledge of the position of dr .",
    "kuzmichev , head of tunka , or other members of the collaboration on the results presented here .",
    "tunka began in the 1990 s and it observes the extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays .",
    "originally tunka operated using 25 cherenkov counters , but the newer tunka-133 array used 133 cherenkov counters covering an area of @xmath21 the tunka-133 data analyzed here was collected during three successive winter seasons from 2009 to 2012 during clear moonless nights .",
    "it consists of approximately @xmath22 events with zenith angle less than @xmath23 and energies @xmath24 measured to an precision of @xmath25@xcite the efficiency of the detectors as a function of zenith is close to @xmath26 up to @xmath27 and reduces to @xmath28 at zenith angles above @xmath23 . as a function of energy ,",
    "the efficiency for @xmath29 is @xmath26 and the threshold is @xmath30 so at @xmath18 it is above @xmath31 tunka-133 also has good exposure in the northern hemisphere , with a field of view of @xmath32 steradians.@xcite      the only cut made on the tunka-133 data set was that the zenith angle should be less than @xmath33 above which the acceptance drops below @xmath31 an energy histogram of the whole data set using energy intervals of width @xmath34 shows about 280,000 events in the peak energy bin straddling @xmath35 in order to search for evidence for a peak near @xmath36 we do not focus on any specific possible source such as cygnus x-3 , but instead first identify a large number of  candidate sources , \" defined arbitrarily as small non - overlapping circular regions of the sky having @xmath37 excess counts above background in each energy bin , and then examine the energy distribution of these candidate sources in five energy bins .    the statistical significance s is found in terms of the on - source counts @xmath38 and the background counts @xmath39 using : @xmath40 in eq .",
    "1 , the background count is found using the shuffling method,@xcite which involves generating artificial events by shuffling the arrival times of all events having very close altitude and azimuth coordinates to generate a set of artificial events . in the absence of any real sources",
    ", this method allows one to calculate an accurate background in celestial coordinates ( right ascension and declination ) .",
    "the systematic error using the shuffling method is less than 0.0008 events for @xmath41 bins , based on 10,000 cycles of shuffling .",
    "thus , for the largest radius search window used ( @xmath42 ) one would expect a systematic error of less than 1.3 counts , which is negligible compared to the statistical fluctuations .",
    "the search procedure is to scan the sky in right ascension @xmath43 and declination @xmath44 and calculate @xmath45 based on the number of events above background in each small non - overlapping circular region .",
    "the procedure is then repeated many times , each time shifting the search pattern of circles by @xmath46 in @xmath43 or @xmath47 .",
    "note that in the model in which the @xmath48 peak was predicted , there was no mention of the angular spread of neutrons arriving from cosmic ray sources , because that would depend on proton decay dynamics and assumptions on the distribution of source distances .",
    "therefore , when doing a blind search it is reasonable to use multiple search radii , and the following three are used : @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 no other search radii were tried .",
    "this choice of the three radii was based on the following considerations : ( a ) the smallest window used is large enough compared to the angular resolution@xcite to give meaningful results , ( b ) the largest one equals the largest window for which signals had earlier been claimed for cygnus x-3 . finally , ( c ) one intermediate choice between them was considered sufficiently different from the others that one might expect to find many possible candidate sources not picked up by the other two .",
    "let us define @xmath52 as the number of times we find an excess above background at a significance level s using a search radius @xmath53 for cosmic rays having for the energy bin centered on energy @xmath54 ( in pev ) , and we also define : @xmath55 as the number of times we find an excess above background at a significance level s using any of the three search radii .",
    "we only use cases , however , where each @xmath56 so as to avoid spurious large values of s resulting from very small numbers , and to avoid a breakdown in the gaussian @xmath57 approximation of errors .",
    "we have examined evidence for a peak near the one at @xmath19 seen by tunka and three other experiments in the all - particle cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "note , however , that an all - sky spectrum of tunka-133 data ( not combined with tunka-25 ) shows no hint of a peak at @xmath58 it is only when searching for numbers of candidate sources that one appears . specifically , when we use five bins of width @xmath59 centered on @xmath60 it is that central energy bin which shows the greatest excess number of candidate sources above what chance predicts .",
    "a peak at this energy is quite consistent with both the all - particle spectrum peak at @xmath61 as well as the earlier reported peak at @xmath62 fig .",
    "1(a ) shows a histogram of @xmath63 versus s , i.e. , the number of times various positive and negative @xmath45 values are found in the all - sky scan for the energy bin centered on @xmath64 as can be seen , the data agree quite well with the expected @xmath65 gaussian distribution for @xmath66 but for @xmath67 the departure from the gaussian appears more pronounced at large @xmath68 for example , while there are 68 candidate sources , i.e. , @xmath69 regions , there are only 18 cases where @xmath70 which is very close to what the gaussian distribution predicts , i.e. , 20 . for greater clarity in showing the magnitude of the deviation from the gaussian for large @xmath71 fig 1 ( b ) shows a blow - up of fig 1(a ) for the region @xmath72",
    "most interestingly , this very pronounced deviation from a gaussian for large positive @xmath45 is seen @xmath73 when the s - distribution is examined for the energy bin centered on @xmath74 and it is significantly less at smaller and larger energies  see fig 2(a ) , which shows the number of candidate sources as a function of energy in excess of the 20 that the gaussian distribution predicts for the only five energy bins we have examined . it must be emphasized that it is the @xmath75 number of candidate sources above background that is plotted in fig 2(a ) , so that one expects the five data points in the absence of real sources to be consistent with zero at all energies , not with an arbitrary horizontal line .",
    "thus , in contrast , to the systematic effect seen for the candidate sources , fig .",
    "2(b ) shows that the number of excess candidate  sinks \" ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath76 regions in fact shows no statistically significant departures from zero for all energy bins .",
    "the over - sampling the same regions of the sky in our search procedure can inflate greatly the statistical significance of the number of candidate sources .",
    "thus , based on fig .",
    "2(a ) it would _",
    "_ n__ot be valid to conclude that the @xmath77 number of candidate sources for the @xmath78 bin is @xmath79 the oversampling bias can be removed only partly by enlarging the uncertainty on the number of sources using 3 search windows by a factor of @xmath80 yielding for the number of excess candidate sources above chance to @xmath81 this penalty factor does not go nearly far enough , however , because the biggest source of oversampling ( especially for the largest size search window ) results from the fact that a localized excess or deficiency having a size comparable to the search window might be picked up by many nearby windows of that size , as we step the whole grid in @xmath46 steps in @xmath43 and @xmath47 across the sky .",
    "a partial way to remove this source of oversampling is to use the distribution in the number of candidate sinks to estimate the uncertainty in the number that chance would predict .",
    "in other words , since no real sinks are physically possible their rms deviations from zero serves as a good estimate of the uncertainty in the excess numbers of sources and sinks .",
    "we find using the five energy bins , an rms deviation of 12 , which how the size of the error bars in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) were determined .",
    "combining the excess counts for the bin centered on @xmath82 with the two adjacent bins , one finds an excess of 102.7 with an uncertainty of @xmath83 were we confident that the oversampling has been removed based on this analysis , the result could be expressed as @xmath84 excess candidate sources above chance , @xmath85 , and hence our result remains to be corroborated by other data sets .",
    "3 shows the locations ( right ascension @xmath43 and declination @xmath47 ) of the 68 candidate sources ( upper graph ) and @xmath86 as numerous sinks ( lower graph ) for the @xmath82 energy bin .",
    "it is clear that the largest fraction of the candidate sources in this energy bin have the @xmath42 radius .",
    "the concentrations of candidate sources in specific @xmath87 regions could in principle have a physical basis , but it also is undoubtedly due to the previously discussed over - sampling bias , especially for the concentration in the vicinity of @xmath88 and @xmath89 where the degree of concentration is most extreme . in the other three concentrations near @xmath90 the spacings between candidate sources is sufficiently large that real physical concentrations of sources is a realistic possibility , even if some amount of oversampling also exists .      in summary ,",
    "support for a peak at @xmath91 is presented  a value consistent with ( a ) the @xmath19 peak seen in the all - particle spectra from tunka and three other groups , ( b ) the 1999 claim of a peak at @xmath92 reported for cygnus x-3 data , and ( c ) the prior 1999 prediction of such a peak at this energy .",
    "the new evidence is @xmath93 in the form of excess counts above what background for any suspected identifiable source(s ) , but rather an excessive number of candidate sources , i.e. , small circular regions of the sky having at least @xmath94 excess counts above chance in energy bins near @xmath82  a procedure that has the effect of greatly enhancing any weak signal , assuming that there are numerous real sources at unknown locations . moreover the numbers of candidate sources seen versus energy falls as one moves away from @xmath82 in either direction , as expected , and no comparable excess is seen in the number of candidate  sinks \" for any of the five energy bins examined .",
    "although fig .",
    "2(b ) might suggest a hint of an energy dependence for the numbers of excess sinks above chance , the chi square probability for a fit to a horizontal straight line at zero height @xmath95 indicates consistency with the previous assertion . despite the possible evidence for a peak at @xmath91 presented",
    ", it is recognized that in view of the methodology used , i.e. , searching for sources at locations where no objects are known to exist , and a failure to deal completely with the oversampling bias , our result can only serve as a motivation to others to see if there is evidence for the enhancement claimed for sources in the same regions of the sky that have been identified here .",
    "if the peak is real , one reason it may not have been claimed previously by others is that most experimenters who saw no statistically significant excess of cosmic rays from the direction of any suspected source probably would have little reason to look at any particular energy band .",
    "obviously , the peak identified here will need to be seen in the new data collected by tunka and/or by others having data sets with sufficient numbers of events near the knee before it will be regarded seriously .",
    "any positive result from future searches would be quite interesting ",
    "@xmath96 if the locations of most of the candidate sources match those in fig . 3 ( a ) .",

    "the cygnus x-3 observations from the 1980 s are now considered highly suspect by many cosmic ray researchers , in light of a subsequent negative searches in which the casa - mia and eas - top collaborations reported no non - episodic signals from cygnus x-3 or anywhere else.@xcite nevertheless , the earlier experiments could be correct , since cygnus x-3 is known to be a highly episodic source , and in fact during strong flares its radio emissions increase a thousand fold , so it is possible that the source might simply have gone quiet during most of the periods those experiments were in operation .",
    "a data set making this possibility plausible was taken by the tibet as - gamma experiment , in which a strong signal was seen for the period 1997 - 2001 in a @xmath101 circle around cygnus x-3 , but virtually no signal for the subsequent 4-year period.@xcite in addition , the negative result in the casa - mia experiment says little about the reality of a 4.5 pev peak , since the number of events for @xmath102 for casa - mia was a mere 0.1% of the total and that for @xmath103 was negligible .",
