    "the optical - conductivity sum rule plays an important role in the understanding of the physics of cuprate superconductors .",

    "the optical - conductivity sum rule is intimately related to the general properties of the current - current response function @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in describing lattice systems , let us consider a general case of the electronic system described by the hamiltonian : h = h_0+h_int , h_0= -_ijt_ij",
    "c_i^c_j-_i c_i^c_i , where the field operator @xmath2 creates an electron of spin @xmath3 at the site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the hopping parameter , @xmath6 is the chemical potential and @xmath7 is the interaction term . for the kinetic part @xmath8 a proper description of the cuprates is obtained by restricting the sum to next - neighboring sites on a squared lattice that results in a band dispersion @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice constant .",
    "however , to avoid unnecessary complications we will also refer below to the simplest case @xmath11 . throughout the paper units @xmath12 are chosen .",
    "given the model , the definitions of the particle current @xmath13 and the so - called diamagnetic tensor @xmath14 follow from the first- and second - order derivatives of the hamiltonian @xmath15 with respect to the external vector potential @xmath16 @xcite : h(a_i)h(0 ) - _ j , so that the total electric current density is expressed as j_i ( ) = - h / a_i ( ) = e j_i ( ) - e^2 _ ii ( ) a_i ( ) , by using the generalized notation @xmath17 where the index @xmath18 with @xmath19 indicates spatial and time components respectively , and @xmath20 is the particle density , one can evaluate @xmath21 within linear response theory @xcite and obtain @xmath22 , where the electromagnetic kernel @xmath23 is defined as : k _",

    "since an isotropic system is considered we can omit the index @xmath36 as done in the lhs of eq .   and in what follows .",
    "to extract the real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity defined in eq .",
    "we should consider the effect of disorder . indeed , for the ( ideal ) case of a system without disorder by taking the real part of one obtains @xmath37 + ( e^2/v ) \\mbox{im}\\pi(\\mathbf{0},\\o)/\\o$ ] .",
    "the presence of a delta function , which means an ideal conductivity of the system , is an artifact of the assumption that no impurities are present .",
    "as soon as disorder is present one expects that in the normal state the following identity holds : ( = 0,0)= < > , so that only the regular part of @xmath38 survives , defined as usual as : ( )= .",
    "thus , using the kramers - kronig ( kk ) relations for @xmath39 one can derive the well - know sum rule : w(t)=_-^ ( ) d = _ -^ d = (= , =0)= < > .",
    "observe that eq .   and require that for the system in the presence of disorder , the _ dynamic _ @xmath40 and _ static _ @xmath41 limits of @xmath42 commute .",
    "this is indeed the case for a disordered system , but not for a clean one , where usually @xmath43 vanishes as @xmath44 @xcite .    as one can see from eq .",

    "we introduced a cut - off @xmath55 in the frequency integration to make contact with the experiments , where only a limited range of frequency is accessible .",

    "an integration up to an infinite cut - off is formally required , an _ intrinsic _ cut - off is provided by the energy @xmath55 below which the tight - binding description is valid .",
    "as we shall see , the definition of such a cut - off in cuprates is a quite delicate issue .",
    "indeed , it is clear from eq .   that the spectral weight depends both on temperature and interaction trough the occupation number @xmath56 , and as a consequence it is a powerful tool to test theoretical predictions coming from different models .",
    "this behavior should be contrasted to the case of an electronic system described by a quadratic band dispersion @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , in this case the tensor @xmath58 reduces to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total carrier density , so that eq .   reduces to the so - called f - sum rule @xmath61 which is temperature and interaction independent . to make contact between the restricted and full f - sum rule it can be useful to define the frequency - dependent spectral weight : @xmath62 in a lattice system one would expect that below @xmath63",

    "when the integration frequency of eq .   is extended above @xmath55 one should evolve towards the f - sum rule , and the inclusion of the processes described by @xmath70 should give a temperature independent spectral weight . observe that while many theoretical results have been provided in the literature about the behavior of the restricted spectral weight , based on different interacting model as eq .",
    ", no clear theoretical understanding exists yet about the evolution of the spectral weight towards the f - sum rule as @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the relation between the optical - conductivity spectral weight and the diamagnetic tensor ( or kinetic energy ) introduced in the previous section is particularly useful from the theoretical point of view , because it allows one to derive the restricted sum rule without doing an explicit computation of the optical conductivity .",
    "however , one can also be interested on the precise structure of @xmath38 , and on the eventual transfer of spectral weight through a phase transition . before discussing the experimental data in the cuprates",
    "it is worth showing some examples of the applicability of the previous formulas in simple paradigmatic cases .",

    "the hopping @xmath81 of the two - dimensional band dispersion can be related to the semi - bandwidth as @xmath82 .",
    "analogously , one can consider the tight - binding dispersion for @xmath11 and estimate , at small electron density , @xmath83 .",
    "the slope @xmath84 so obtained is not far from the value of @xmath85 obtained around half filling , see ref .",
    "* cut - off definition in the drude model * + in metals displaying a conventional fermi - liquid behavior the quasiparticles behave as free electrons with a renormalized mass @xmath86 and a characteristic scattering time @xmath87 . in the drude approximation",

    "drude( , t)= = , where we made the dependence on the lattice spectral weight @xmath88 explicit . in fig .",
    "[ fig - drude ] we report the integrated spectral weight as a function of the frequency . as one can see , at frequencies of the order of few times the inverse scattering time @xmath89 , @xmath90 of the total value @xmath91 is recovered , showing that in this case the cut - off frequency @xmath55 can be identified as @xmath92 @xcite . in a conventional metal",
    "one expects that eq .",
    "reproduces in good approximation the optical conductivity , eventually with a @xmath89 slightly temperature dependent .",
    "moreover , the fermi - liquid paradigm ensures that the quasiparticles still have a fermi surface , with an occupation number @xmath93 given by the fermi function .",
    "the only effect of interactions is to renormalize the bandwidth , which can be for example determined with lda calculations or extracted by some measurement of the fermi surface ( as for example by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) ) .",
    "an example of such conventional fermi - liquid behavior in gold has been indeed reported recently in ref .",
    "+ to make contact with the notation that we will use below while discussing the experiments , we observe that for the drude model one usually expresses the spectral weight in terms of the energy @xmath94 , which corresponds to the relations : _",
    "drude= , w(_m)=. observe that in the drude model the scale @xmath95 is also related to the zero of the real part of the dielectric function @xmath96 , which is defined as : ( )=_1+i_2=_+ , where @xmath97 represents the screening by interband transitions .",
    "using eq .",
    "we see that : _",
    "1^drude()=_- . as a consequence",
    ", we see that when @xmath98 the real part of the dielectric function vanishes at a frequency @xmath99 given by : _",
    "1^drude(_0)=0 _0 ^ 2= ( 1- ) , so that within the drude model @xmath100 can also be related to the restricted spectral weight .",
    "moreover , since in conventional metals @xmath101 , in these materials the term `` plasma edge '' refers both to the edge of intra - band optical absorption and to the spectral weight itself of the intra - band conductivity .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath99 is directly related to the temperature dependence of @xmath102 ( or @xmath88 ) only if @xmath103 is also temperature independent .",

    "* superconducting transition * + when a system displays a phase transition to a new ordered state , with cdw , sdw or sc formation , the occupation number @xmath93 changes temperature dependence with respect to the simple fermi function characteristic of the normal state of fermi - liquid systems . a typical example is provided by the sc transition , where within the bcs approximation one can show that the spectral weight acquires the form : @xmath104\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the @xmath1-wave sc gap and @xmath106 is the quasiparticle dispersion in the sc state .",
    "one can easily see that the spectral weight @xmath107 decreases as @xmath108 is lowered below @xmath109 .",
    "bearing in mind eq .  , this decrease can be understood as a consequence of the kinetic - energy increase in the sc state , where the states above @xmath6 become occupied due to the particle - hole mixing .      from the experimental point of view , the determination of the cut - off @xmath55 in eq .   follows naturally from the observation of a minimum of the reflectivity ( or of the conductivity ) of cuprates at the so - called _ plasma edge _ @xmath110 .",
    "this energy scale is of the order of @xmath111 @xmath112 in all the families of cuprates , and can be identified as the frequency @xmath99 at which the real part of the dielectric function crosses zero @xcite .",
    "it is then usually assumed that transitions above @xmath110 involve interband processes , so that @xmath110 is a good candidate for the cut - off @xmath55 used in eq .",
    "to relate the spectral weight @xmath68 to the diamagnetic tensor , according to eq .  .",
    "in this range one expects that the temperature dependence of @xmath91 gives information about the interactions acting on the system .",

    "a detailed discussion of all the peculiarities of the optical conductivity of cuprates is beyond the scope of this paper , and can be found for example in the recent reviews @xcite .",
    "we only recall here that quite often the optical conductivity of cuprates is analyzed in terms of the so - called extended drude model , which relies on an extension of eq .   including a frequency - dependent optical mass enhancement @xmath113 $ ] and optical scattering time @xmath114 , according to the formula : ( )=.",
    "although the representations of experimental data using @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 are formally equivalent , it has become rather popular to discuss the _ pseudogap behavior _",

    "as we explained above , @xmath102 is related the reduced spectral weight @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , normally @xmath102 is found from the sum rule written in the form @xmath119 . as stressed in @xcite , the choice discussed here of the somehow arbitrary cut - off @xmath55 introduces an uncertainty in the overall scale factor of the optical scattering rate and optical mass in eq .  .",
    "as one can see in table  i , @xmath102 has values around 2 ev in bi@xmath120sr@xmath120cacu@xmath120o@xmath121 ( bi-2212 ) , bi@xmath120sr@xmath120ca@xmath120cu@xmath122o@xmath123 ( bi-2223 ) and yba@xmath120cu@xmath122o@xmath124 ( ybco ) compounds , and somewhat smaller values in la@xmath125sr@xmath126cuo@xmath127 ( lsco ) samples .",
    "the analysis of the optical data is usually performed by using a cut - off @xmath55 temperature and doping independent , even though some variation in @xmath99 has been reported for example in bscco compounds @xcite . however , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature variations of @xmath99 can not be directly related to temperature variations of the spectral weight , because the temperature variations of @xmath99 are also affected by the thermal correction induced by the scattering time , see eq .  .",
    "in table i we summarize some values of the low - temperature spectral weight taken from the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite . as we explained before",
    ", the strength of the restricted partial weight @xmath88 can be expressed both as @xmath128 or in terms of the kinetic energy @xmath51 per @xmath129 in - plane atom as in eq .  .",
    "to fix the energetic units , it can be useful to take into account the following relations . in most of the experiments",
    "the spectral weight @xmath130 is defined as half of the value , because one integrates only the data at positive frequencies . then from eq .   in @xmath73 dimensions",
    "and we have two relations : _p^2=4w=8w_exp = e_ck , where the energy scale @xmath131 in appropriate units is : e_c== = 14.38 ev  , and @xmath1 is the distance between cuo@xmath120 planes . to compare the data between single - layer and multi - layer compounds we used for @xmath1 the average distance between two neighboring layers , which corresponds approximately to 13.2  , 6  , 7.5   and 6.2   in lsco , ybco , bi-2212 and bi-2223 compounds respectively .",
    "since the spectral weight @xmath130 is measured usually in @xmath132@xmath133 one should also use the equivalence 1@xmath112=0.21 @xmath132@xmath112 @xcite .",
    "then one can obtain both the spectral weight in @xmath133 ( or equivalently in ev@xmath134 ) , and the kinetic energy @xmath51 , given by @xmath135 .",
    "finally , we note that the background dielectric constant @xmath136 has typical values around @xmath137 in cuprates , explaining the difference between @xmath110 and @xmath102 in tablei .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +    table ii : slope @xmath138 of the @xmath139 temperature variation of the spectral weight in several families of cuprates .",
    "we report here the value obtained integrating the spectral weight up to the cut - off @xmath140 as reported in table  i for the same compounds .",

    "finally , we describe the evolution of spectral weight in the superconducting state . when the sc order is established , part of the low - frequency spectral weight moves into the sc response , represented by a singular contribution to the optical conductivity : ^sc_singular()= , where @xmath145 is the superfluid density , related to the penetration depth @xmath146 by the usual relation @xmath147 . as a consequence , below @xmath109",
    "the real part of the conductivity reads : (  ) = ( )+_reg , where @xmath148 is the regular part of the conductivity below @xmath109 . as far as the sum rule is concerned , one sees that the condensate contribution is always included in @xmath88 , and the effect of the sc transition is already taken into account by the general formula through the change in the occupation number .",
    "for example , in the bcs theory the spectral weight is expected to decrease below @xmath109 , see eq .  . however , from the experimental point of view the definition is useful to correctly determine the spectral weight @xmath88 by taking into account also the condensate contribution .",
    "thus , one usually integrates the spectral weight of the regular part up to @xmath149 , @xmath150 , obtained from the finite - frequency measurement of the conductivity , and estimate the superfluid weight as @xmath151 , usually using the slope of the inverse imaginary part of @xmath152 , see eq .  .",
    "then the value @xmath153 can be compared with the theoretical prediction , which usually concerns the spectral weight integrated up to the cut - off @xmath154 .",
    "in particular , the bcs model predicts a decrease of @xmath88 as @xmath108 decrease in the sc state , to be contrasted to the increase expected in the normal state according to eq .  .",
    "even though all the procedure described above can be affected by a significant error , due mainly to the exact determination of the superfluid weight , nonetheless it was reported by two different group that in an underdoped and an optimally - doped bi-2212 compound @xcite and in an underdoped bi-2212 film @xcite there is an effective _ increase _ of the spectral weight in the sc state with respect to the value in the normal state .",
    "more specifically , it was shown that by integrating @xmath155 up to the cut - off @xmath156 @xmath91 is still increasing as @xmath108 decreases , with a temperature variation even larger than the value @xmath138 found in the normal state , see eq .  .",
    "this result has been recently confirmed in a slightly underdoped bi-2223 sample @xcite .",
    "later on , santander et al . showed that in the optimally - doped sample the spectral weight is almost constant in the sc state , with @xmath157 @xcite , as it seems to be the case also for lsco @xcite .",
    "finally , a more conventional result has been observed in an overdoped bi-2212 film @xcite , showing that the anomalous spectral - weight behavior can be eventually doping dependent .",
    "however , these results has been questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the optical data of an optimally - doped ybco sample and slightly - underdoped bi-2212 sample up to a larger cut - off of @xmath158 ev were considered .",
    "according to the analysis of boris et al . , the spectral weight of ybco and bi-2212 in this frequency range keeps _ constant _ in the normal state and decrease when the sc state is formed .",
    "thus , the issue of the spectral - weight behavior below @xmath109 remains at the moment quite controversial @xcite , and seems to be related mainly to the analysis of the optical data rather than to an effective discrepancy between them .",
    "in particular , it seems to us that in ref .  @xcite it is mainly questioned the choice of the plasma edge @xmath159 ev as the proper cut - off @xmath55 for the analysis of optical data .",
    "however , this is the most plausible choice from the theoretical point of view , because extending the spectral - weight integration to interband processes one naturally recovers the full f - sum rule , which is just a constant and does not provide any significant information on the interactions acting on the system .",
    "while it is clear that any successful theory of htsc should be able to explain the above - mentioned experimental facts , despite the 20 year jubilee since the discovery of htsc , there is no consensus yet neither on the general theory of htsc , nor on the particular explanation of these facts .",
    "although our goal is to present here the latest theoretical results for the optical - conductivity sum rule within the _ @xmath1-density wave _ paradigm , we would like to mention some other works related to this issue in the recent literature .",
    "a first class of papers is related to the spectral - weight below the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "for example , the possibility of a spectral - weight change below @xmath109 in terms of the lowering of the in - plane kinetic energy has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a model with `` occupation modulated '' hopping terms was considered .",
    "the reduction of the kinetic energy at @xmath109 was attributed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) to the transition from a phase - incoherent cooper pair motion in the pseudogap regime above @xmath109 ( see , e.g. review @xcite ) to a phase coherent motion at @xmath109 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite a model with a frequency dependent scattering rate was used .",
    "more recently , the optical - conductivity sum rule was analyzed for a model with electrons in the finite band coupled to a single einstein oscillator @xcite and in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model @xcite .",
    "as far as the anomalous behavior of the spectral weight in the normal - state is concerned , a possible interpretation was recently given by toschi _",
    "_ @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors evaluate the spectral - weight behavior within the dynamical mean - field analysis of the repulsive hubbard model , and they show that the large slope @xmath138 ( see eqs .   and ) is a consequence of the bare - bandwidth renormalization @xmath160 where @xmath161 as the mott - insulator is approached . at the same time the @xmath142 value of @xmath88 is much less affected by the @xmath162 renormalization , due to the contribution of the so - called mid - infrared processes , which occur below @xmath110 and partly compensate for the reduction of the quasi - particle weight @xcite .",
    "finally , the behavior of the spectral weight in the ddw state was addressed specifically in a series of recent papers , ref . @xcite . while the issue of the vertex corrections , discussed below , is the most important ingredient of the refs .",

    "however , we _ do not _ intend to analyze here to which extent the ddw model can explain the vast body of the experimental data accumulated during the last 20 years . instead of this",
    "we will concentrate on rather important theoretical subtleties of the ddw model that are often overlooked and their implications for the optical conductivity . yet before writing down the model hamiltonian we find useful to remind the reader of the rather long history of the model .",

    "an other possibility is that the order parameter describes microscopic currents running on few sites of the lattice , as it is the case for the flux phase @xcite or for the current patterns proposed by varma @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that strictly speaking the flux phase does not present a charge modulation , even though a gap is present in the excitation spectrum .",

    "this attitude was for example considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ddw state emerges as the consequence of the proximity of the system to a quantum critical point @xcite .",

    ", the hamiltonian can be considered as an `` effective '' model for the normal ( i.e. non sc ) pseudogap phase of cuprates , where sc forms within a standard bcs mechanism , since all the anomalies related to the presence of a pseudogap are already included in the hamiltonian .",
