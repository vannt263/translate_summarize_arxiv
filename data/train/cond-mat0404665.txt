    "in my recent paper @xcite , a new theory to discuss first order gas - liquid phase transition in statistical mechanics is given .",
    "the basic idea is the following : 1 ) a new space homogeneity assumption ( sha ) is postulated : in a classical system in equilibrium with volume @xmath0 , particle number @xmath1 , when gravity and boundary effects are omitted , each particle occupies volume @xmath2 averagely .",
    "the sha is quite different from eyring s assumption(it is referred as ehsa sha later ) @xcite : the number of the particles in a volume @xmath3 is @xmath4",
    ". we will demonstrate in detail later that the sha , in contrast with ehsa sha , will exhibit the correlation between the mean distance of molecules and the partition function .",
    "2 ) in order to calculate the intermolecular potential and the partition function for a classical system , a new formulation  mean distance expansion , instead of mayer s cluster expansion @xcite , is introduced , which is characterized by the intermolecular mean distance @xmath5 , as a parameter , appearing in the expressions of the intermolecular potentials and the partition functions .",
    "this implies that the intermolecular potentials and the partition functions are dependent on the intermolecular mean distance .",
    "thus the derivatives of partition functions ( some thermodynamic functions ) will be relative to the intermolecular mean distance .",
    "3 ) a new explanation on first order gas - liquid phase transition in statistical mechanics is given : first order gas - liquid phase transition does not correspond to singularities of thermodynamic functions . for a given temperature @xmath6 and some pressure @xmath7 ,",
    "there are two densities of particle number @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( densities of vapor and liquid ) that satisfy the equations @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in each branch thermodynamic functions , such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 , are analytic .",
    "4 ) the new theory tells us how to calculate the physical quantities in a system of coexistent vapor and liquid : densities of coexistent vapor and liquid , vapor pressure and latent heat , etc .    in this paper",
    ", we will give some concrete models , as examples , to exhibit how the new theory works .",
    "in section two , starting from the sha and the mean distance expansion , and by using sutherland potential , we obtain partition function of vdw fluid and coexistence of two phases is discussed .",
    "densities of vapor and liquid , vapor pressure and latent heat for vdw fluid are also calculated . in section three , modified vdw fluid is discussed and the better results are obtained . in section four , the differences between new theory and mayer s cluster expansion are identified .",
    "for a classical system in equilibrium , we consider the pair interaction which is only relative to the distance of particles .",
    "the potential energy between particle @xmath14 and particle @xmath15 is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance of these two particles .",
    "we assume that the potential energy @xmath16 is shared by particle @xmath14 and particle @xmath15 together and is divided to these two particles equally .",
    "according to the sha , particle @xmath14 occupies a volume @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the particle number density . for convenience ,",
    "suppose that this volume is a sphere with radius @xmath20 , and particle @xmath14 is located at its center .",
    "we then draw many spherical surfaces centered by particle @xmath14 outside the sphere , so that the volume of every shell formed by neighboring two spherical surfaces is @xmath2 , and we will have one particle per shell averagely . the radius @xmath21 of the @xmath22 sphere is determined by @xmath23",
    ". then intermolecular potential energy of particle @xmath14 can be expressed as @xmath24 and the total potential energy of the system is @xmath25 .",
    "thus the partition function is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is thermal wavelength . if the intermolecular potential is the sutherland potential @xmath28 we obtain the partition function of vdw fluid @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and free volume @xmath31 .",

    "the blue curve is drawn from experimental data of argon @xcite .",

    "how can we get @xmath109 so that it coincides with experimental data ? by letting @xmath89 and @xmath90 in eqs.@xmath110 and @xmath111 as the functions of @xmath82 as follows @xmath112@xmath113we obtain densities of vapor and liquid @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which almost exactly coincide with guggenheim s experimental curve , with @xmath116 as shown in fig.5 .",

    "when the system runs from @xmath121 to @xmath122 , or from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , the reduced potential energies per particle will vary as @xmath120 changes , which is completely different from mayer s work .      in a homogeneous system with a temperature @xmath6 and the corresponding vapor pressure @xmath7 ,",
    "when the number of particle is unknown , the phase in which this system exists , for example liquid phase or vapor phase , is uncertain .",
    "these different fluid phases correspond to different solutions of eqs.(16  17 ) , which form two branches of solutions of eqs.(16  17 ) .",

    "the function @xmath127  is not differentiable at @xmath128or @xmath123 on the isotherm @xmath125 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the segments @xmath129 and @xmath130 in fig.6 are described by different partition functions respectively .",
    "the segment @xmath129 or @xmath131 is on an isotherm of a homogeneous system , which is described by partition function ( 4 ) .",
    "the segment @xmath130 in fig.6 describes an isotherm for an equilibrium coexisting vapor - liquid system that is not a homogeneous system and can not be described by partition function ( 4 ) . in appendix",
    "b we give a partition function for an equilibrium coexisting vapor - liquid system , which corresponds to the segment @xmath130 .",
    "the calculation about latent heat is one of the most important parts in this paper , which provides a powerful support to the sha  the basic assumption in this work , and distinguishes this work from previous works , for instance , mayer s cluster expansion and the ehsa sha , evidently .",
    "the average distance of gas molecules is larger than that of liquid molecules .",
    "the interaction of gas molecules and the interaction of liquid molecules can be described by the same interaction potential , such as eq .",
    "the difference between the mean distances of molecules in the two phases results in the difference of molecular potential energies in the two phases .",
    "when a liquid molecule vapors and becomes a gas molecule , there is an interaction potential energy gap between the molecules in the two phases @xmath132 . on the other hand ,",
    "the work done by the change between the volumes per mole in the two phases is @xmath133 .",
    "the sum of the interaction potential energy gap and the work is equal to latent heat .",
    "this is the true physical meaning of latent heat  what mayer s cluster expansion and ehsa sha have failed to point out .      from the discussion about the liquid - gas transition in this paper , we know that the gases and the liquids appear in different branches of diagram @xmath134 and diagram @xmath135 , but yet surface tension is not taken into account",
    ". when surface tension is considered , supersaturation and supercooling may occur .",
    "the isotherm will follow @xmath136 or @xmath137 in fig.6 . on the segments @xmath138 or @xmath139 ,",
    "the system is not in a stable equilibrium , but still is homogeneous , and can be described by partition function ( 3 ) . in these cases ,",
    "thermodynamic functions are analytic in each branch , even at the first order transition points @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "when @xmath140 we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the critical phenomena will appear .",
