    "the general desire to break time - reversal symmetry and reciprocity in engineered photonic structures has garnered an immense amount of recent interest . recall that while time - reversal symmetry is only a useful notion in non - dissipative systems , reciprocity is more general : it is defined as the invariance of photon transmission amplitudes under exchange of source and detector @xcite . on a fundamental level ,",
    "the artificial breaking of time - reversal symmetry allows the realization of truly new photonic states , such as quantum hall states and more general topological states @xcite . on a more practical level",
    ", nonreciprocal devices can enable a number of signal - processing applications and greatly simplify the construction of photonic networks @xcite .",
    "nonreciprocal microwave - frequency devices are also crucial to efforts at quantum - information processing with superconducting circuits .",
    "here one necessarily needs to use near quantum - limited amplifiers to efficiently read out qubits ; nonreciprocity is crucial to ensure the qubits are protected from unwanted noise stemming from the amplifier .",
    "the conventional solution is to use circulators employing magneto - optical effects ( faraday rotation ) to break reciprocity .",
    "these devices have many disadvantages : they are bulky and can not be implemented on - chip ( hindering scaling - up to multi - qubit systems ) , and they use large magnetic fields , which can be deleterious to superconducting devices .",
    "their use also typically leads to insertion losses .",
    "a number of strategies have been developed to break reciprocity without the use of magneto - optical effects in both optical systems and superconducting circuits .",
    "for nonreciprocal photon transmission , approaches based on refractive - index modulation @xcite have been considered , as well as strategies using optical non - linearity @xcite , optomechanical interaction @xcite , and interfering parametric processes @xcite .",

    "it employs reservoir engineering @xcite , where a structured dissipative environment generates useful quantum behavior . in our approach ,",
    "the dissipative reservoir ( which could simply be a damped auxiliary cavity mode ) generates an effective dissipative interaction between the modes of interest .",
    "nonreciprocal behavior is then obtained by balancing this induced dissipative interaction against the corresponding coherent version of the interaction .",
    "as we discuss , this simple yet powerful trick allows one to generate both isolators ( which only allow unidirectional transmission ) , and nonreciprocal , quantum - limited phase - sensitive amplifiers ( which have zero added noise ) as well as phase - preserving amplifiers ( which add the quantum - limited amount of noise , a half quantum at the signal frequency ) .",
    "while our approach uses a kind of interference , it is markedly different from more typical interference - based approaches , in that it allows perfect directional behavior over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the method is also simple enough that it could be implemented in a wide variety of architectures ; in particular , it is extremely well suited to implementations using superconducting circuits and optomechanics .",
    "our approach to nonreciprocity is intimately connected to the theory of cascaded quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this is an effective theory developed to describe situations where a nonreciprocal element is used to couple two quantum systems ( e.g. ,  such that the output field of one cavity drives a second cavity , but not vice - versa , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchcascaded](c ) ) .",
    "we show that the effective interactions used in this theory have _ exactly _ the form described above : one balances a coherent  photon tunneling \" interaction between the two cavities against a corresponding dissipative version of this interaction .",
    "we also demonstrate that cascaded quantum systems theory is not simply an effective theory for describing nonreciprocal transmission : it also serves as a recipe for constructing nonreciprocal devices , one that can be generalized to amplifying interactions .",
    "as we discuss , the needed dissipative interactions can be obtained by simply coupling to intermediate damped cavity modes ; one does not need to start with an explicitly nonreciprocal reservoir ( as assumed in the derivations of refs .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "throughout this work , we consider a generic situation where we have a pair of cavity modes ( annihilation operators @xmath1 ) , each coupled to input / output waveguides ; our goal is to engineer a nonreciprocal interaction between them , thus enabling either nonreciprocal transmission or amplification of signals incident on the two modes .",
    "our approach is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchcascaded](b ) : we allow both cavities to interact with one another in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is via a direct , coherent interaction described by an interaction hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "while our approach can make a general factorizable cavity - cavity interaction directional , we focus here on simple bilinear interactions .",
    "the coherent interaction will thus be described by a quadratic hamiltonian , having the general form ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are in general complex .",
    "we always work in a rotating frame where the two cavities are effectively resonant , and where @xmath2 is time - independent .",
    "each of the two interactions in this hamiltonian could be realized in many ways ; for example , one could start with three modes and a generic three - wave mixing hamiltonian , and then displace one of the modes with a coherent tone .",
    "the driven modes act as pumps ; by a suitable choice of frequencies ( i.e. ,  at the difference and the sum of cavities 1 and 2 resonance frequencies ) , one realizes the above hamiltonian , with the amplitudes and phases of the couplings @xmath7 being controlled by the pump modes amplitudes .",
    "such an approach has been exploited recently in superconducting circuits , using the josephson parametric converter ( jpc ) geometry @xcite , as well as in quantum optomechanics @xcite .",
    "the second required interaction involves controllably coupling both cavities to the same dissipative reservoir ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchcascaded](a ) ) .",
    "eliminating this reservoir will generate an effective dissipative interaction between the cavities ( i.e. ,  one that can not be described by some direct hamiltonian coupling ) .",

    "note that an asymmetry in the couplings does not change the basic physics in which we are interested ; thus , for simplicity , we take @xmath15 in what follows .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 characterize the individual coupling of each cavity to the engineered bath .",

    "<S> we discuss a general method for constructing nonreciprocal , cavity - based photonic devices , based on matching a given coherent interaction with its corresponding dissipative counterpart ; our method generalizes the basic structure used in the theory of cascaded quantum systems , and can render an extremely wide class of interactions directional . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to standard interference - based schemes , our approach allows directional behavior over a wide bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> we show how it can be used to devise isolators and directional , quantum - limited amplifiers . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail how this general method allows the construction of a directional , noise - free phase - sensitive amplifier that is not limited by any fundamental gain - bandwidth constraint . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is particularly well - suited to implementations using superconducting microwave circuits and optomechanical systems . </S>"
