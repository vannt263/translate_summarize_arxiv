    "the epoch of reionization is one of the least known periods in the history of our universe . according to",
    "the present understanding , reionization of neutral hydrogen ( ) is an extended process spanning over the redshift range @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) during this period is characterised by bubbles of ionized hydrogen ( ) , centred around luminous sources .",
    "stars forming within early galaxies are believed to be the major sources of ionizing photons during this era ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "quasars are expected to be very rare during this epoch , but they are capable of generating larger bubbles around them with respect to their stellar counterpart .",
    "detection of these bubbles will directly probe the state of the local igm around the ionizing sources .",
    "it will also constrain the properties of the quasar , such as its luminosity and age .",
    "the highest redshift at which a quasar has been detected till date is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the ly-@xmath21 absorption spectrum of this object reveals a highly ionized near zone of radius @xmath22 mpc ( physical ) .",
    "the observed near zone size is unexpectedly small when compared with the other high redshift quasars observed in the redshift range @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the ionizing photon emission rate estimated for this quasar is @xmath24 assuming a power law for the unabsorbed continuum emission blueward of ly-@xmath21 line .",
    "the quasar s age ( @xmath4 ) and local volume averaged neutral fraction ( @xmath25 ) can be estimated from the size of the quasar s near zone , however the estimated @xmath4 and @xmath26 are strongly correlated .",
    "for the same observation @xcite have constrained the @xmath4 and @xmath26 using simulated ly-@xmath21 absorption spectra .",
    "this study shows that there are several combinations of the @xmath4 and @xmath26 all of which can reproduce the observed data .",
    "they find that the spectrum observed by @xcite is consistent with @xmath27 yr with either @xmath28 provided there is a proximate damped ly-@xmath21 absorber ( dla ) or @xmath29 without a proximate dla .",
    "the same observation is also consistent with @xmath30 yr and either @xmath31 with a proximate dla or a fully neutral igm @xmath32 without a proximate dla .",
    "it is quite clear that observations of ly-@xmath21 absorption spectra are limited in their ability to determine the age of the quasar and the local neutral fraction .",
    "this limitation essentially arises from two reasons .",
    "the first being that the igm becomes nearly opaque at a very low neutral fraction @xmath33 .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between a neutral fraction of @xmath34 from a completely neutral medium , and the actual ionized bubble around the quasar may extend far beyond the region inferred from the ly-@xmath21 absorption spectra .",
    "the second limitation arises from the fact that the ly-@xmath21 absorption spectrum is a pencil beam observation along a line of sight ( los ) to the quasar .",
    "the presence of a proximate dla can completely change the interpretation of the spectrum .",
    "the redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the epoch of reionization is believed to be a powerful tool to detect bubbles around quasars .",
    "the intensity is directly proportional to the density , and it is in principle possible to probe the entire ionization profile of the bubble",
    ". it may be possible to overcome the limitations of ly-@xmath21 absorption spectra using redshifted 21-cm observations , and place better constraints on the quasar parameters and the state of the igm .",
    "this is particularly motivated by the fact that the presently functioning gmrt @xcite and lofar , and the upcoming mwa and 21cma are all sensitive to the signal from the epoch or reionization . however , redshifted observations have their own limitations in that the signal is extremely small relative to the sensitivities of the present and upcoming telescopes .",
    "further , the signal will be buried deep in foregrounds which are a few orders of magnitude larger than the signal @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hitherto paper i ) have proposed a matched filter technique to detect ionized bubbles in radio - interferometric observations of redshifted 21-cm emission .",
    "the matched filter optimally combines the entire signal of an ionized bubble while minimizing the noise and the foreground contributions .",
    "the redshift @xmath35 is most optimal for bubble detection @xcite , and at this redshift a @xmath12 detection is possible for bubbles of comoving radius larger than @xmath36 and @xmath37 mpc with @xmath38 hr of observation using the gmrt and mwa respectively , assuming that the neutral hydrogen fraction is @xmath39 outside the bubble .",
    "this technique , however , is limited by the density fluctuations in outside the bubble , and analytical estimates ( paper i ) and simulations @xcite show that it is not possible to detect bubbles of comoving radius @xmath40 and @xmath41 mpc using the gmrt and mwa respectively , however large be the observation time .",
    "the matched filter technique mentioned above assumes the bubble to be spherical .",
    "however , a growing spherical bubble will appear anisotropic along the los to a present day observer due to the finite light travel time ( fltt ) @xcite and also due to the evolution of global ionization fraction @xcite . in an earlier work ( @xcite ; hitherto paper ii ) , we have analytically quantified this anisotropy and studied the possibility of detecting such a bubble in a targeted search around a known quasar .",
    "we find that the bubble appears elongated along the los during the early stages of its growth , whereas it appears compressed in the later stages when the growth slows down .",
    "in addition to this , the apparent centre of the bubble also shifts towards the observer .",
    "we find that a spherical filter is adequate for bubble detection even when the apparent anisotropy of the bubble s shape is taken into account , the centre of the best matched filter will however be shifted relative to the quasar .",
    "we also propose that the measured shift and the radius of the best matched filter can together be used to constrain the age and luminosity of the quasar .    in this work",
    "we consider the detection of an bubble in a targeted 21-cm search centred on a known quasar at @xmath42 and we investigate the possibility of using such an observation to constrain the properties of the quasar and the igm .",
    "for this purpose we improve upon the spherical filter by calculating the apparent , anisotropic shape of the quasar bubble and using this as a template for the filter.we expect this to give a better match to the bubble that is actually present in the data .",
    "further , we also expect improved parameter estimation using the improved filter .",
    "our earlier work ( paper ii ) was entirely based on analytic estimates which do not take into account the presence of ionizing sources other than the quasar and the inhomogeneities in the igm .",
    "we have overcome this limitation here by using the semi - numerical technique @xcite to simulate the ionization field .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows  in section 2 we briefly discuss the model for bubble growth around a quasar , and the matched filter technique for detecting such a bubble .",
    "we also present the improved filter based on the calculated apparent shape of the bubble . in section 3",
    "we use analytic estimates , based on the bubble growth equation , to study the snr for bubble detection .",
    "we use this to determine the parameter range where a @xmath12 detection is possible in @xmath9 hr of observation with the gmrt .",
    "we then consider parameter estimation , and explore the kind of limits that can be placed on the quasar and igm properties using the matched filter technique .",
    "section 4 briefly describes how we have simulated the apparent shape of quasar bubbles , and we present our results and summarize our findings in section 5 .",
    "our entire analysis is restricted to the redshift @xmath1 .",

    "the bubble is expected to be nearly spherical in sets b and d.    we see that the simulated bubbles are in reasonable agreement with what is expected , though the simulated bubbles are nearly always larger .",

    "these distortions are particularly important when the halos located near the bubble s boundary contribute a significant fraction of the total ionizing photons within the bubble .",

    "we see that the bubbles are larger in comparison to the situation with uniform recombination .",
    "it is possible to understand this by noting that in these models the dense regions in the igm remain neutral through enhanced recombination , and only the low density regions are ionized .",
    "consequently , a larger volume has to be ionized in order to achieve a particular value of the mass averaged neutral fraction @xmath6 .",

    "we first discuss the sets e and f where the bubble is at a very early stage of its growth and is rather small .",
    "we require more than @xmath9 hr of observation for a @xmath176 detection .",
    "we find that in these two sets the neutral fraction is underestimated in almost all the realizations .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the actual bubble is almost always larger than expected ( figure [ fig : rperp ] ) due to the presence other ionizing sources within the bubble .",
    "this effect is more pronounced when the igm neutral fraction is low ( @xmath173 in set e ) .",
    "this discrepancy in the bubble size only affects the estimated neutral fraction .",
    "the bubble in its early stage is very sensitive to @xmath4 through the anisotropy @xmath73 and the shift parameter @xmath69 ( figure [ fig : contour_eta_s ] ) which are not severely affected by the overall size of the bubble .",
    "we find that in sets e and f the quasar age inferred from the simulations is quite close to the actual value .",
    "we next consider a , b , c and d which correspond to later stages of the bubble s growth .",
    "we find that the scatter in the values of @xmath6 and @xmath4 inferred from the simulations is considerably smaller for a high neutral fraction @xmath165 ( c and d ) as compared to @xmath177 ( a and b ) where the halos make a relatively larger contribution to the ionizing photons . in sets",
    "a and b the estimated @xmath6 is found to be uniformly scattered around the actual value .",
    "however , the value of @xmath4 is overestimated in the majority of the simulations . in set d",
    "we find that both @xmath6 and @xmath4 are slightly overestimated in the simulations , while nearly all the simulated values lie very close to the actual value in set c.    in summary , our analysis is based on the assumption that the snr of the estimator will peak when the parameters of the filter exactly match those of the bubble that is actually present in the data .",
    "the statistical uncertainty of the estimator will , however , cause the peak to shift introducing an uncertainty in parameter estimation .",
    "further , distortions in the shape and size of the bubble due to other ionizing sources and the inhomogeneities in the igm will also cause the peak snr to shift , introducing further uncertainties in parameter estimation . in our work",
    "we have used the criteria @xmath174snr @xmath175 to analytically estimate the statistical uncertainties .",
    "further , we have used simulations to assess the effect of the distortions .",
    "we find that the statistical uncertainties are large in most of the situations that we have considered , and hence these can be used to determine the uncertainties in the estimated parameter .",
    "we find that reliable parameter estimation is possible using bubbles for which a @xmath178 detection is possible in @xmath9 hr of observation .",
    "smaller bubbles , which require longer observations , do not provide very reliable estimates of @xmath6 , they can however be used to obtain a reliable estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "at the moment we do not have a rigorous justification for the criteria @xmath174snr @xmath175 which we have adopted here . a more detailed statistical analysis involving extensive simulations with large number of realizations of both the statistical fluctuations as well as the distortions",
    "are required . at the moment",
    "this is beyond the computational power available to us .",
    "however , 21-cm observations of ionized bubbles hold the promise of allowing us to probe the age of the quasar and the neutral fraction of the igm , and we plan to pursue such simulations in future .",

    "<S> the 21-cm detection of an ionized bubble , thus , holds the promise of allowing us to probe the quasar and igm properties at @xmath1 .    in the current work we have analytically calculated the apparent shape and size of a quasar s ionized bubble assuming an uniform igm and ignoring other ionizing sources besides the quasar , and used this as a template for matched filter bubble search with the gmrt visibility data </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that @xmath5 is known from the observed infrared spectrum , and @xmath8 from theoretical considerations , which gives us the two free parameters @xmath6 and @xmath4 for bubble detection . considering @xmath9 hr of observation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there is a reasonably large region of parameter space bounded within @xmath10 and @xmath11 where a @xmath12 detection is possible if @xmath13 . the available region increases if @xmath5 is larger , whereas we need @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 . considering parameter estimation , we find that in many cases it will be possible to quite accurately constrain @xmath4 and place a lower limit on @xmath6 with @xmath9 hr of observation , particularly if the bubble is in the early stage of growth and we have a very luminous quasar or a high neutral fraction . </S>",
