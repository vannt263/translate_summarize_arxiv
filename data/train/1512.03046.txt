    "the second generation of cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) photoproduction experiments used the frozen spin target ( frost ) , which allowed double - polarization measurements on proton . with the frost , we measure all beam - target double - polarization observables for single pseudoscalar meson photoproduction and for two charged pion production as well .",
    "this makes possible the complete experiment , which measures enough observables for unambiguous and direct reconstruction of the reaction amplitude  @xcite .",
    "clas collected data with linearly and circularly polarized photons and longitudinally and transverse polarized target . many of the observables in this experiment were measured for the first time .",
    "the entire data set is invaluable for a multi - channel analysis .",
    "the value of these data is more than just its broad coverage for different reaction channels and observables .",
    "the real strength of this program is its measurement of everything under the same controlled conditions with the same systematic uncertainty .",
    "this provides much stronger constraints for subsequent analyses of the properties of contributing nucleon resonances . with this greater understanding of these observables , effects of higher spin resonances",
    "can be investigated  @xcite .    in this contribution , we present a measurement of the double - polarization observable @xmath0 in the @xmath2 reaction of circularly polarized photons with longitudinally polarized protons @xcite .",
    "the full energy coverage is e@xmath3 = 466  1825  mev ( w = 1325  2075  mev ) .",
    "the experiment was performed at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "data were taken within clas @xmath4 run group , november 2007 through february 2008 .",
    "longitudinally polarized electrons from the cebaf accelerator with energies of @xmath5 = 1.465  gev and 2.478  gev were incident on the thin bremsstrahlung radiator of the hall - b photon tagger  @xcite and producing circularly polarized tagged photons in the energy range between @xmath6 = 466  1825  mev .",
    "the degree of circular polarization of the photon beam , @xmath7 , depends on the ratio @xmath8 and increases from zero to the degree of incident electron - beam polarization , @xmath9 , monotonically with photon energy  @xcite @xmath10 measurements of the electron - beam polarization were made routinely with the hall - b moeller polarimeter .",
    "the average value of the electron - beam polarization was found to be @xmath11 .",
    "the electron - beam helicity was pseudo - randomly flipped between @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a 30  hz flip rate .",
    "the collimated photon beam irradiated the frost @xcite at the center of the clas  @xcite .",
    "frozen beads of butanol ( @xmath14 ) inside a 50  mm long target cup were used as target material .",
    "the protons of the hydrogen atoms in this material were dynamically polarized along the photon - beam direction and polarization was frozen .",
    "the degree of polarization on average was @xmath15 .",
    "the proton polarization was routinely changed from being aligned along the beam axis to being anti - aligned .",
    "quasi - free photoproduction off the unpolarized , bound protons in the butanol target constituted a background .",
    "data were taken simultaneously from an additional carbon target down - stream of the butanol target to allow for the determination of the bound - nucleon background .    the missing mass technique @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is @xmath18 was used to identify the reaction .",
    "final - state protons were detected in clas .",
    "the particle detectors used in this experiment were a set of plastic scintillation counters close to the target to measure event start times ( start counter ) @xcite , drift chambers  @xcite to determine charged - particle trajectories in the magnetic field within clas , and scintillation counters for flight - time measurements  @xcite .",
    "coincident signals from the photon tagger , start- , and time - of - flight counters constituted the event trigger .",
    "data from this experiment were taken in seven groups of runs with various electron - beam energies and beam / target polarization orientations .",
    "events with one and only one positively charged particle and no other charged particles detected in clas were considered .",
    "the protons were identified by their charge ( from the curvature of the particle track ) and by using the time - of - flight technique .",

    "these data are fitted using three different pwa approaches - said  @xcite , maid  @xcite , and bnga  @xcite .",
    "the resulting consistency of helicity amplitudes for the dominant resonances demonstrates that the pwa results are largely driven by the data alone ; the modest differences gauge the model - dependence .",

    "unfortunately , recent cbelsa asymmetry @xmath0 for @xmath1  @xcite is insufficient for that study because of so broad energy binning ( @xmath40 ) ( fig .",

    "results are consistent with pwa predictions ( said , maid , and bnga pwa groups ) at lower energies and will offer more results to be fit in the higher energy ranges . the fine binning and unprecedented quantity of the data impose tight constraints on pwa , especially at high@xmath44 multipoles and at high cm energies where new resonances are expected to exist .",
    "the three light quarks can be arranged in 6 baryonic families , the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",

    "based on flavor @xmath51 symmetry , we expect to have twice as many @xmath45  ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath46  ( @xmath57 ) resonances .",
    "the number of experimentally identified resonances of each non - strange baryon family is @xmath58 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the seriousness of the  missing - states \" problem is obvious from these numbers .",
    "the hypothesis of a very small @xmath59 coupling of missing states has received support from a quark - model calculations @xcite .",
    "we should stress that the standard @xmath59 pwa ( most of our current knowledge about the bound states of three light quarks  @xcite ) reveals resonances with widths of order @xmath60 100  mev , but not too wide ( @xmath61 ) or possessing too small a branching ratio ( @xmath62 ) , tending ( by construction ) to miss narrow resonances with @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "however , conclusions on missing states should await the results of more realistic , coupled - channel calculations in which rescattering of the mesons , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , is considered .",
