    "rr cae is one of a few double - lined eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , v471 tau , qs vir , rxj2130.6 + 4710 , and rr cae ) containing white dwarfs where the masses and radii of both component stars can be determined accurately ( e.g. , obrien et al . , 2001 ; odonoghue et al . , 2003 ; maxted et al . , 2004 , 2007 )",
    "it was discovered to be an eclipsing binary by krzeminski ( 1984 ) in which the cool white dwarf component is eclipsed by an m - type dwarf companion every 7.3h .",
    "the amplitude of the radial velocity ( of the dme star ) throughout the orbit was mentioned as 370 km / s .",
    "bruch & diaz ( 1998 ) published an r - band light curve and classified the spectral type of the red - dwarf companion as m5v or m6v .",
    "further spectroscopy around the @xmath4 line was presented by bruch ( 1999 ) who derived a spectroscopic orbit for the m - dwarf and determined absolute parameters of the binary system .",
    "the mass of the m - type dwarf was estimated as 0.09@xmath5 by bruch & diaz ( 1998 ) and bruch ( 1999 ) , which was much lower than expected given its spectral type .",
    "several narrow absorption lines of neutral metals , e.g. , ali , fei and mgi , were found by zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with keck telescope hires echelle observations , which were thought to have been accreted onto the surface of the white dwarf from the m - dwarf .",
    "a more detailed photometric and spectroscopic investigation was recently presented by maxted et al .",
    "they showed that rr cae is a detached binary containing a cool white dwarf primary with a mass of @xmath6 and an @xmath7-type secondary with a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "searching for planetary companions to short - period white dwarf binaries will shed light on the formation and evolution of planets , as well as provide insight into the ultimate fate of planets and the interaction between planets and evolved stars . because of the very small size of the white dwarfs , eclipse times of this type of binary system can be determined with a high precision , and very small - amplitude variations in the orbital periods could be detected by analyzing the observed - calculated ( o - c ) diagrams .",
    "therefore , they are the most promising targets to search for circumbinary brown dwarfs and planets by analyzing the light - travel - time effect . to date",
    ", a few substellar companions to eclipsing white - dwarf binaries were found by using this method , such as v471 tau ( e.g. , guinan & ribas 2001 ) , dp leo ( qian et al . 2010a ; beuermann et al .",
    "2011 ) , qs vir ( qian et al .",
    "2010b , almeida & jablonski 2011 ) , nn ser ( qian et al . 2009 ; beuermann et al .",
    "2011 ) , and hu aqr ( qian et al . 2011 ) . in this letter",
    ", by including 6 new mid - eclipse times , the variations of the o - c curve of rr cae were analyzed .",
    "our results suggest that there is a circumbinary giant planet orbiting the eclipsing binary , and there is some evidence for a second , more distant companion .",
    "to4.0 in    ' '' ''    the white dwarf - red - dwarf eclipsing binary , rr cae , was monitored on december 4 and 7 , 2010 with roper scientific , versarray 1300b camera , with a thinned eev ccd36 - 40 de @xmath9 pix ccd chip , attached to the 2.15-m jorge sahade telescope at complejo astronomico el leoncito ( casleo ) , san juan , argentina . during the observation ,",
    "v filter was used and an exposure time for each ccd image was adopted as 50s .",
    "the clock of the control computer operating the versarray 1300b ccd camera is calibrated against utc time by the gps receiver s clock .",
    "two nearby stars that have similar brightness in the same field of view of the telescope were chosen as the comparison star and the check star , respectively .",
    "all images were reduced by using phot ( measure magnitudes for a list of stars ) of the aperture photometry package of iraf .",
    "the corresponding light curves are displayed in fig . 1 ; the eclipse depth is about 1.84 magnitudes .",
    "to4.0 in    ' '' ''    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the upward parabolic variation in the @xmath10 curve indicates that the period of rr cae is increasing continuously at a rate of @xmath0s / s . since rr cae is a detached binary system where both components are in the critical roche lobes , no lobe - filling mass transfers occur between both components .",
    "moreover , the angular momentum loss caused by gravitational radiation or / and magnetic braking should produce a decrease in the orbital period . therefore , neither mass transfer nor angular momentum loss can explain the period increase of rr cae .",
    "all of these suggest that the observed upward parabola in the @xmath10 curve may be an apparent variation in the orbital period due to the influence of an additional orbiting body . as in the cases of the eclipsing polar hu aqr ( qian et al .",
    "2011 ) and the sdb - type eclipsing binary ny vir ( qian et al .",
    "2012 ) , it may be only a part of a long - period ( longer than 26.3years ) cyclic change , possibly revealing the presence of another circumbinary planet in a wider orbit . some authors ( e.g. , horner et al .",
    "2011 ; wittenmyer et al .",
    "2012 ) proposed that the serious problem for the presence of the fourth body is the dynamical stability of the circumbinary planetary system .",
    "however , dynamical simulations by hinse et al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggested a family of stable orbital solutions , though for shorter timescales than tested by horner et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    if the cyclic variations in the o - c curve of rr cae are really caused by the light - travel time effects via the presence of circumbinary planets , they should be strictly periodic . to check the existence of the planetary system ,",
    "more mid - eclipse times are needed in the future . moreover , as pointed out by qian et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , at the maximum points of the cyclic o - c changes , rr cae should be at the farthest position of the orbit , while the circumbinary planets are closest to the observer . if the tertiary companion is coplanar to the central eclipsing binary , the circumbinary planet should be in the light of the binary system and transit the binary component stars .",
    "therefore , searching for the transits of the binary components by the circumbinary planets at the o - c maxima can ascertain the presence of the planetary system .",
    "however , the possibility of transits is very low ( @xmath11 by assuming a radius of @xmath12 for the m dwarf stars ) .",
    "recently , a saturn - like planet transiting the m - type components in the eclipsing binary kepler-16 was reported by doyle et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which provides the first direct evidence for the presence of a circumbinary planet .",

    "new ccd photometric observations of rr cae were obtained with the 2.15-m `` jorge sahade '' telescope .",

    "<S> by using six new determined mid - eclipse times together with those collected from the literature , we found that the observed - calculated ( o - c ) curve of rr cae shows a cyclic change with a period of 11.9years and an amplitude of 14.3s , while it undergoes an upward parabolic variation ( revealing a long - term period increase at a rate of @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cyclic change was analyzed for the light - travel time effect that arises from the gravitational influence of a third companion . </S>",
