    "iron - based superconductors show rich phase diagrams , with the high - temperature superconducting dome being in the close proximity to an antiferromagnetic striped phase @xcite that sets in at a temperature @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , a structural phase transition at @xmath4 , from the high - temperature tetragonal phase into an orthorhombic phase , has been shown to closely follow the magnetic transition @xcite , i.e. : @xmath6 .",
    "it was proposed that spin - fluctuations , associated with the striped phase , lead to emergent electronic nematic degrees of freedom at higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite these electronic nematic degrees of freedom then couple to the lattice and induce the structural phase transition to the ortorhombic phase .",
    "@xcite    there is a mounting evidence for an electronic nematic state : resistivity - anisotropy measurements @xcite and the measurement of the elastoresistance , @xcite the observed anisotropies in thermopower , @xcite optical conductivity , @xcite torque magnetometry , @xcite and in stm measurements .",
    "@xcite measurements of the elastic constants showed that the shear modulus strongly softens in the high temperature tetragonal phase.@xcite a theoretical analysis @xcite based upon nematic fluctuations due to a strong magneto - elastic coupling showed that the inverse shear modulus is proportional to the susceptibility of the nematic order parameter @xmath7 , which diverges at the structural phase transition , explaining its softening .",
    "the most direct evidence for the magnetic origin of nematicity so far is the scaling of the shear modulus and the nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate , seen in iron - pnictides .",
    "@xcite an interesting open issue in this context is the lack of such scaling behavior in iron - chalcagonides .",
    "@xcite    a relation between nematicity and the raman response of iron based superconductors was already studied in ref . where the kramers - kronig transform of the raman response was compared with the shear modulus , as well as in ref . .",
    "here , we demonstrate , based on an explicit microscopic theory that i ) there is no enhancement of the electronic raman response function in the @xmath8 channel upon lowering the temperature , ii ) that the raman response function develops a pronounced peak at the structural phase transition in the @xmath0 symmetry , and iii ) that there is some response in the @xmath9 channel , which weakens as the temperature is lowered towards the structural transition temperature .",
    "we start from the spin - driven scenario for the nematic phase , in which magnetic fluctuations stabilize a nematic phase , characterized by the broken c@xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the raman response function measures the electronic density - density correlator weighted by appropriate form factors . since electrons interact with spin fluctuations , the latter will manifest themselves in the raman response function in the form of corrections to the electron self energy and the raman vertex , formally expressed in terms of aslamazov - larkin diagrams .",
    "@xcite we show that the leading order aslamazov - larkin ( al ) diagram supports only the @xmath9 and the @xmath0 symmetry , but not the @xmath8 symmetry , which explains the lack of enhancement of the raman response signal as one approaches the structural transition in the @xmath8 channel , as seen in experiments .",
    "@xcite however , this leading order approach can not account for the rapid increase in the amplitude of the raman response function in the @xmath0 channel , as one approaches the structural transition , as seen in the experiments of refs . .",
    "instead it would predict a similar increase only at the magnetic phase transition .",
    "therefore , we go beyond the leading order approximation , and take into account collisions between spin fluctuations that become more and more important as one approaches the nematic / structural transition . our approach is based on the exact same collisions between spin - fluctuations that led to the emergence of spin - induced nematicity in the first place .",
    "formally this is accomplished by inserting a series of quartic paramagnon couplings , mediated by electronic excitations , into the raman response function .",
    "such quartic couplings contain a product of four fermionic green s functions and give rise to a peak of the electronic raman response function at the structural phase transition in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "on the other hand , if we re - sum such higher order al diagrams in the @xmath9 channel , this will lead to the suppression of the raman response in the aforementioned channel .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the low frequency raman response in the @xmath0 channel is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the frequency difference between incoming and outgoing photons and @xmath13 the multi - index for momentum and frequency .",
    "@xmath14 stands for the leading order aslamazov - larkin diagram , @xmath15 is the magnetic susceptibility , and @xmath16 the nematic coupling constant of the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the susceptibility of the nematic order parameter of our model , in the large @xmath5 limit is given by @xmath17 where in a purely electronic theory @xmath18 . in a purely electronic theory , this would then lead to the divergence of the raman response function at the structural phase transition .",
    "however , one needs to include the effect of the lattice dynamics @xcite in order to analyze this problem .",
    "we do so by introducing nemato - elastic coupling and find that , in this case , @xmath19 is shifted .",
    "@xcite here @xmath20 is the elasto - nematic coupling constant , and @xmath21 the bare value of the orthorhombic elastic constant .",
    "we show that when magnetic and structural phase transitions are split @xcite this leads to a maximum of the amplitude of the electronic raman response function in the @xmath0 channel at the structural phase transition , in agreement with the recent experiments .",
    "@xcite the raman response function could then be used to probe the dynamic excitation spectrum of the nematic degrees of freedom , similar to inelastic neutron scattering that probes the dynamic spin excitation spectrum .",

    "we then calculate higher order diagrams that take into account collisions between spin - fluctuations . finally , after summing an infinite number of these higher - order diagrams within a controlled @xmath23 expansion , we show i ) that the maximum of the raman response function in the @xmath0 channel occurs when the nematic susceptibility diverges , i.e. at the structural phase transition , and ii ) that the amplitude of the raman response function in the @xmath9 response gets suppressed .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "two different approaches have been proposed in order to explain the origin of nematic phase in pnictides and its relation to the magnetic phase  the orbital scenario @xcite and the spin - driven nematic scenario .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of these approaches see for example ref . .",
    "here we follow the approach of a spin - driven nematic state . in this scenario , the nematic phase is stabilized by magnetic fluctuations that are associated with the stripe density wave ( sdw ) phase .",
    "the order parameter of the sdw state@xcite can be characterized by an @xmath24 manifold @xcite  @xmath25 is the spin - rotational symmetry and @xmath26 a discrete symmetry associated with the choice of the ordering wave - vector , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "let the two order parameters associated with these two ordering wave vectors be @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the sdw state is characterized by broken @xmath25 and @xmath26 symmetries . on the mean - field level",
    "the breaking of @xmath26 and @xmath25 symmetry occurs simultaneously .",
    "however , when one includes fluctuations , these transitions can be split . in case of joint transitions",
    ", they are usually both first order transitions.@xcite the criterion for breaking the discrete @xmath26 symmetry via a second order transition is a threshold value of the magnetic correlation length @xmath31 . decreasing the temperature leads to an increase of @xmath31 . before the correlation length diverges at the magnetic phase transition temperature , the threshold value will be reached and spin - driven nematicity sets in .",
    "this naturally explains why the magnetic and structural phase boundaries are correlated and leads to an intermediate phase with @xmath26 symmetry breaking without @xmath25 symmetry breaking .",
    "this intermediate state is the nematic phase in the pnictides .",
