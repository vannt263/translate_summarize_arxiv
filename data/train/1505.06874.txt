    "the idea of introducing complex absorbing potentials is originated from the description of scattering processes [ 1 - 7 ] . in these studies",
    "it is always strongly emphasized that these kind of potentials relate to a kind of dissipative behavior of the considered phenomenon .",
    "usually , it is useful to treat some simple physical system to achieve the deeper meaning from the behavior under the complex potentials in the dissipation and the irreversibility . the results on a simple system can be used for further investigation ; for example , this may happen during photon absorption process ( e.g. , infra - red spectroscopy @xcite ) where the effect of solvent could be treated in this frame .",
    "it can be studied that in an absorption - emission process how the solvent can also drain energy from the molecular oscillations . on the other hand , during the discovery of bose  einstein condensates ( bec ) the thermal cloud ( non - condensed particles ) create a damping effect @xcite .",
    "it is known that bec also behaves as an oscillator ( in a parabolic trap ) , the calculations can also be useful for that phenomenon of physics .",
    "open systems might also be studied with the current procedure .",
    "that is why we make example calculations on the damped quantum oscillator first .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be generalized [ 1 - 7,11 ] by applying a complex potential in the form @xmath0 , where the introduced @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real - valued , thus @xmath3 and parallel its complex conjugate is @xmath4 due to the sign change at the complex potential term , instead of the continuity equation , we obtain a balance equation for the expression @xmath5 : @xmath6 the third term is a source density thus the expression @xmath7 can only have a probability meaning if @xmath8 ( in the conventional manner ) . since , eq . ( [ eq : sch7 ] ) is a balance equation , depending on the sign of the source , presently @xmath9 , the integral @xmath10 in the all space may decrease or increase in time .",
    "it sounds physically acceptable that if @xmath10 changes in time , the _ decrease _ is the relevant choice to describe losses .",
    "the case of decrease is limited from below by the @xmath11 , however , the case of increase is not necessarily limited from above .",
    "thus , from this physical reason the complex potential @xmath9 must be negative which will describe the dissipation or loss in the system .",
    "the probability meaning can also be generalized to negative complex potential cases with the meaning that in some measurements the particle seems to be missing .",
    "thus @xmath12 represents the remaining fraction of the initial ensemble .",
    "first focus on the case of the one - dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator whose kernel and the time evolution of its wave function can be solved analytically by the feynman path integral method @xcite .",
    "for this reason the start of the examination from the lagrangian of the classical harmonic oscillator seems to be relevant . that can be written as it is usual in the formulation of @xmath13 the related action @xmath14 during the considered motion between the @xmath15 time interval can be calculated by the evaluation of the integral @xmath16 . through the detailed calculations @xcite we formulate the action as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where the elapsed time is denoted by @xmath18 ; the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the initial and final space coordinates at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . in the sense of the feynman path integral method the propagator ( kernel ) can be formulated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a time dependent amplitude factor . after the normalization procedure",

    "it is necessary to avoid this mathematical conflict ( singularities both in the square root and in the exponential ) .",

    "( the @xmath28 denotes the floor operation . ) the time evolution of the wave function from the initial space - time @xmath29 to @xmath30 is governed by the propagator as @xmath31 the oscillation starts from a normalized gaussian initial wave function @xmath32{\\frac { m\\omega}{\\pi\\hslash } } \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{m\\omega}{2\\hslash}(y - y_0)^2 \\right)\\ ] ] with its centre position @xmath33 , the @xmath34 , and then the @xmath35 distribution can be evaluated . a time series of @xmath35 with parameters set as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is shown in fig . [ const_shape_rho_in_half_period ] in which the evolution can be easily followed .",
    "the time period is @xmath39 .",
    "a detailed study of the oscillator wave packet motion was elaborated by naqvi and waldenstrm @xcite .",
    "it is shown that by introducing a @xmath40 parameter , the width of the wave packet also `` oscillates '' , i.e. , the gaussian shape periodically changes in time described by the expression @xmath41",

    "[ shape_change_rho_in_half_period ] shows .",
    "this propagator formulation will be generalized to the complex potential case to achieve the description of the damped quantum oscillator .",
    "now , we can turn to our present example in which the complex harmonic potential  shown in fig .",
    "[ complex_potential ]  is introduced in the following form @xmath44 as it can be seen , both potential terms are quadratic in @xmath45 . here",
    ", the real valued angular frequencies @xmath46 and @xmath47 pertain to the real and the imaginary parts . to shorten the formulas we introduce the abbreviation @xmath48 . accepting the above idea of the potential @xmath49 , the complex lagrangian can be expressed as @xmath50 the action of the present problem can be obtained by the direct substitution of the complex frequency @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ action_real ] ) @xmath52 keeping the physically correct signs . here",
    ", the phase @xmath53 can be expressed by @xmath54 it is easy to check that the real part of @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ complex_omega ] ) is exactly the frequency of the undamped harmonic oscillator @xmath55 while the imaginary part of @xmath51 relates to the factor @xmath56  that expresses the friction ( @xmath57 ) in the classical mechanical systems  ,",
    "i.e. @xmath58 we note that the sign of the @xmath59 is negative . due to the imaginary term in the lagrangian",
    "the action @xmath60 becomes also complex @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for further calculations it is useful to write the sine in the denominator as @xmath62 while the cosine factor in the coordinate dependent part is @xmath63 summarizing the previous considerations , the propagator of the damped oscillator can be expressed as @xmath64 \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the normalization factor .",
    "however , due to the dissipation , @xmath65 must be defined in the initial time @xmath66 by the following equation in one dimension : @xmath67 from the physical considerations it seems obvious that this factor decreases in time .",
    "naturally , it must also involve the undamped case , i.e. , when @xmath68 .",

    "the calculations are evaluated by numerical programming . as fig .",
    "[ rho_in_half_period ] shows the width of the distributions depends on the parameter @xmath75 as is in the case of undamped oscillator @xcite . in the present case of @xmath76 ,",

    "[ damping_several_periods ] , in which the series of distributions ( in different @xmath80 time periods /not each/ ; @xmath81 ) are plotted at the given position @xmath82 .",
    "the measure of dissipation can be presented by the decrease of the distribution .",
    "for this reason the @xmath83 is also calculated as a function of time .",
    "this plot can be seen in fig [ dissipative_loss ] .",
    "we note that the real part causes only translation ( and it results vibration along the axis @xmath45 ) , but the area below the curve should remain constant .",
    "however , the imaginary part of the potential causes the dissipative behavior decreases the value of this integral .",
    "since , the complex part of the potential generates the dissipation of the oscillator , thus the energy loss @xmath84 ( dissipated energy ) between the time interval @xmath85 relates to the relevant part of the potential @xmath2 .",
    "it can be formulated by the integral @xmath86 the lost energy is plotted in fig .",
    "[ lost_energy ] .",
    "we have shown how the kernel of the damped oscillator can be calculated applying the path integral method introducing complex harmonic potentials .",
    "starting from an initial gaussian wave function the time dependent wave function @xmath87 of this oscillator could be evaluated .",
    "the plotted values of the expression @xmath88 as a function of time clearly shows the dissipation during the damped oscillator motion . the time - dependent energy loss is also calculated .",
    "the hamilton operator of the presented system can be divided into a real and an imaginary part @xmath89 where @xmath90 pertains to @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the complex part of the potential @xmath93 the adjoint operator of @xmath94 is @xmath95 which means that the hamilton operator is not hermitian @xmath96 the time evolution of the system is @xmath97 where the time evolution operator @xmath98 is introduced . for the present case",
    "we write @xmath99 the @xmath100 completes the time translational symmetry if @xmath101 holds .",
    "now , @xmath102 and @xmath103 from it can be immediately recognized that @xmath104 i.e. , the time translational symmetry is broken which is expected due to the irreversible behavior . the oscillator energy is not conserved , i.e. , the dissipative behavior is involved in the theory in a natural way .",
