    "euclidean lattice @xmath4 allows one to calculate ground state properties of hadrons , but real time response functions are somewhere between difficult and impossible . on the other hand ,",
    "deep inelastic scattering gives us information about correlation functions on ( or exceedingly close to ) the light - cone .",
    "light - front quantization seems to be a promising tool to describe the immense wealth of experimental information about structure functions for a variety of reasons : ( 1 ) correlation functions along the light - cone become `` static '' ( i.e. equal @xmath5 ) observables in this approach .",
    "( 2 ) structure functions are easy to evaluate from the light - front wavefunctions .",
    "( 3 ) these structure functions are easily interpreted as light - front momentum densities . however , before one can apply the light - front formalism to @xmath4 and other field theories , one has to remove the divergencies first ( i.e. regularize and renormalize ) .",
    "one interesting idea in this direction is called the `` transverse lattice '' @xcite . instead of discretizing all four space - time directions ( like in euclidean lattice @xmath4 ) or the three space directions ( like in the hamiltonian formulation of lattice @xmath4 )",
    "one discretizes only the two transverse ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) directions while leaving the longitudinal directions ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) continuous . on the one hand the transverse lattice",
    "thus provides a gauge invariant uv regularization scheme and on the other hand it is still possible to perform canonical light - front quantization  making it a promising approach towards performing non - perturbative calculations of deep inelastic structure functions .",
    "there remains the question what one should do with the still continuous ( i.e. infinitely many degrees of freedom ) longitudinal directions .",
    "first one may be tempted to discretize the @xmath10 ( the light - cone space- ) direction as well .",
    "however , such an approach is suffering from a fundamental difficulty : the longitudinal momentum is not conserved on a longitudinal lattice . due to bragg reflections",
    "it is only conserved modulo @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the longitudinal lattice spacing .",
    "normally ( i.e. in normal coordinates ) this is not a problem because the minimum of the kinetic energy occurs at @xmath13 .",
    "however , the light - cone energy decreases with increasing momentum ( @xmath14 , in the continuum ) i.e. a minimum is reached for @xmath15 ! of course on a lattice the momentum can not become infinite but still the minimum of the kinetic term occurs around ( depending on the precise form of the lattice action ) @xmath16 .",
    "since the total momentum is not conserved this implies that particles tend to accumulate near this minimum .",
    "however , with such a large momentum the particles can resolve the granular structure of the lattice and no meaningful continuum limit will be obtained .",
    "note that a similar pathology would occur in an unconstrained ( total momentum allowed to vary ) variational calculation of the light - front energy of a hadron in the continuum .",
    "it is conceivable that adding a lagrange multiplier proportional to the total light - front momentum to the lattice action cures the problem ( in the continuum this amounts to minimizing @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , this idea will not be pursued here any further .",
    "instead , i found it more useful to work in momentum space as far as the longitudinal direction is concerned because this allows one easily to maintain longitudinal momentum conservation  a crucial necessity for light - front calculations as we have seen above .",
    "one momentum space technique which has been widely applied to light - front quantized @xmath0-dimensional field theories is discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite .",
    "there one puts the system into a longitudinal box and imposes periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions @xmath19 .",
    "the momenta thus become discrete and solving the equations of motion for a fixed value of @xmath20 has been reduced to diagonalizing a finite matrix ( note that all light - cone momenta are positive and thus there is only a finite number of states associated with a given value of @xmath20 .",
    "the longitudinal continuum limit is achieved by making @xmath20 sufficiently large . in @xmath0 dimensions this technique was very useful and effective @xcite for example ,",
    "it has been used to demonstrate the existence of a nucleon - nucleon bound state in @xmath21 with @xmath22-color and @xmath22-flavor in a calculation on the level of quarks  despite the small binding energy ( @xmath23 1% ) of this `` deuteron '' @xcite .",
    "one mayor obstacle for applications of dlcq to @xmath2 and @xmath24 dimensional field theories has been the exponential growth of the number of basis states with the number of transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , a dlcq calculation for a scalar field ( with antiperiodic boundary conditions in the @xmath25 direction ) on a ( rather modest ) @xmath26 transverse lattice with a longitudinal momentum @xmath27 has already a basis size of @xmath28 .",
    "a more reasonable @xmath29 transverse lattice with the same @xmath20 requires a basis of @xmath30 states !",
    "these astronomical numbers clearly demonstrate that any direct matrix diagonalization approach or even a lanczos type algorithm is doomed to fail because one is not even able to store the wavefunction in any available computer .",
    "another numerical method for studying light - front hamiltonians is the light - front tamm - dancoff approach @xcite where one imposes severe truncations of the fock space .",
    "sometimes this method is combined with dlcq , i.e. one formulates the light - front hamiltonian in the dlcq basis but restricts ( _ ad hoc _ ) the fock space to few particle states .",
    "however , it is not clear to what extend this truncation modifies the dynamics and whether effective light - front hamiltonians can be constructed by systematically eliminating higher fock states . because of these difficulties , all numerical studies of light - front hamiltonians have been restricted to @xmath0 dimensions and/or severe tamm - dancoff truncations and/or perturbation theory .    in this work monte carlo techniques will be exploited to obtain approximate ground state energies and structure functions for dlcq problems in @xmath2 and @xmath24 dimensions on a transverse lattice without any constraints on the fock space other than those resulting form the discreteness of the momenta .",
    "note that the algorithm which i will present requires that the interaction in the transverse direction is local ( nearest neighbor interaction at most ) .",
    "that is why the theory will be formulated on a transverse coordinate space lattice .",
    "the algorithm would not work with a momentum space lattice . to avoid obscuring the monte carlo algorithm with other difficulties",
    "the technique will be explained for a real scalar field with @xmath31 coupling in @xmath2 dimensions , which is one of the most simple field theories one can formulate on a transverse lattice . the main reason to chose @xmath32 for illustrating",
    "this new method is that @xmath4 is too complicated for a `` first study case '' and for demonstration purposes .",
    "other theories one might think of , like @xmath33 of @xmath34 are not asymptotically free , i.e. there is no bjorken scaling for deep inelastic structure functions . however , it should be emphasized that the technique is _ a priori _ applicable to any dlcq hamiltonian which is formulated on a transverse lattice , provided the interactions satisfy locality in the transverse direction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first the dlcq hamiltonian for @xmath31 in @xmath2 dimensions on a transverse lattice will be constructed . in section [ sec : mcalg ] , the infinitesimal light - front time evolution operator will be approximated using a checkerboard decomposition and a path integral in the fock space of dlcq will be used to project out the ground state for given quantum numbers . finally , in section",
    "iv , the path integrals will be evaluated using an initial value random walk algorithm based on a variation of the ensemble projector monte carlo method .",
    "the minkowsky action for the @xmath32 model , in the continuum , reads @xmath35 after discretization in the transverse direction one thus obtains @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon rescaling @xmath37 the interpretation of the transverse lattice action as the action of a `` multiflavor '' field theory ( @xmath38 being the `` flavor '' index in this interpretation and @xmath39 being a canonical field defined in @xmath0 dimensions ) becomes evident @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] light - front quantization of ( [ eq : action ] ) is standard @xcite : first one puts the system into an @xmath25-box of length @xmath41 with antiperiodic boundary conditions ( the associated zero - mode effects and implications for the renormalization are discussed in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "= \\delta_{nm } \\delta_{qk}.\\ ] ] finally one obtains for the light - front momentum operator @xmath47 and for the light - front energy @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the usual light - front kinetic energy on each site and @xmath50 is , up to the factor @xmath51 the self interaction for @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is a momentum conserving kronecker @xmath54 .",
    "neighboring sites are coupled through the hopping term @xmath55 note that , as in all dlcq problems , the length of the box factorizes completely .",
    "thus we will in the following work with the rescaled operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 at least in principle one could now proceed as follows : for fixed @xmath58 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 commute ) one diagonalizes @xmath59 , yielding the eigenvalue @xmath60 and thus the invariant masses of the physical states @xmath61",
    ". physical observables like structure functions are obtained by calculating the appropriate matrix element in these states .",
    "the continuum limit is reached by extrapolating to @xmath62 . for one or two sites",
    "this can be easily done . for four sites",
    "this is also still possible .",
    "however , beyond about @xmath63 sites direct diagonalization methods ( including the lanczos algorithm ) soon become useless due to the exponential growth of the required basis size .",
    "what is needed at this point is a monte carlo method that allows one to find the ground state ( for given value of @xmath58 ) of the dlcq hamiltonian @xmath59 more efficiently . developing and testing such an algorithm will be the main subject in the rest of this paper .",
    "before we come to the monte carlo algorithm i should add a few comments .",
    "first , although i have derived the transverse lattice dlcq hamiltonian only for @xmath32 , similar expressions can be derived for @xmath24 dimensions and/or other field theories @xcite",
    ". many aspects are completely general .",
    "for example , for many field theories ( including @xmath64 @xcite ) the transverse `` hopping '' is provided by a nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this is crucial for the algorithm which i will present in this paper because ( i ) one can easily approximate the infinitesimal light - front time evolution operator as will be explained in section [ sec : mcalg ] ( ii ) it is possible to `` locally update '' the states in a random walk algorithm which thus provides a computational advantage on large transverse lattices .",
    "second , i should discuss renormalization at this point .",
    "besides the tadpoles ( which are zero in light - front quantization @xcite ) there is only one divergent diagram in @xmath32 , namely the setting sun diagram ( fig.[oyster ] ) .",
    "this diagram leads to a divergent self mass contribution while the associated wave function renormalization is finite . therefore , for @xmath32 it will be sufficient to add an appropriate mass counterterm to render the theory finite in the continuum limit . here",
    "one has to be a little careful in dlcq because the longitudinal momentum of the incoming line in ( fig.[oyster ] ) effectively determines which higher fock states are allowed in the intermediate state .",
    "hence the self mass , and thus the required mass counterterm , for ( fig.[oyster ] ) depend on the longitudinal momentum ( of course , for large longitudinal momenta , this dependence asymptotically disappears ) .",
    "for the renormalization this leaves at least two options : one possibility is to calculate how the infinite part of the self energy depends on the longitudinal momentum by evaluating ( fig.[oyster ] ) within dlcq . or one allows the bare mass to depend on the longitudinal momentum in such a way that the physical mass of the lightest state is independent of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "this is possible if one uses the following `` sequential '' procedure : first one solves the dlcq hamiltonian for @xmath65 ( which is trivial ) and adjusting the bare mass for @xmath65 until one satisfies the renormalization condition .",
    "then one repeats the same procedure for @xmath66 while keeping the bare mass for @xmath65 partons fixed and so on . in the continuum limit ( large longitudinal momenta ) both methods should be equivalent .",
    "however , i preferred to use the second method ( sequential renormalization ) because it seemed to converge faster numerically in @xmath58 . furthermore , because one must verify numerical convergence in @xmath58 , it is anyway necessary to repeat the calculation for several @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , the computer time spent usually grows rapidly with @xmath58 , i.e. the numerical effort associated with additional calculations for small values of @xmath58 in the sequential renormalization is negligible .",
    "another advantage of renormalizing such that @xmath67 is independent of @xmath58 is that multiparticle thresholds in two point functions appear at the correct energy values relative to the single particle pole .",
    "this issue has often been neglected in dlcq calculations .",
    "furthermore , while the first method works only for @xmath32 because there is only one divergent self - energy diagram in this theory , the sequential method is non - perturbative and can thus be applied to the dlcq hamiltonian for any field theory .",
    "the coupling constant for @xmath32 receives only a finite renormalization .",
    "nevertheless , in principle one should always fix the bare coupling by imposing another renormalization condition . since the spectrum of @xmath32 consists only of the fundamental particle and its scattering states , and",
    "since the mass of the fundamental particle has already been used up to fix the bare mass term , one has to use physical observables other than the mass spectrum in this case .",
    "however , since this is a special feature for @xmath32 i decided not to renormalize the coupling at this point . in the following ,",
    "all results will be quoted with the bare coupling constant for which they were calculated .",
    "in this section , we will use the fact that repeated application of @xmath68 , where @xmath59 is the dlcq hamiltonian ( [ eq : hdlcq ] ) , on any state @xmath69 with given light - cone momentum @xmath58 ( [ eq : kdlcq ] ) gives the ground state @xmath70 for this particular @xmath58  of course provided @xmath69 is not orthogonal to the ground state @xmath70 .",
    "the light - front imaginary time evolution operator @xmath68 can be approximated using the trotter formula @xcite @xmath71 \\right ] - 2 \\left [ h_b , [ h_a , h_b ] \\right ] \\right\\ } + ... \\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-\\varepsilon h_a/2}e^{-\\varepsilon h_b}e^{-\\varepsilon h_a/2 } + { \\cal o}(\\varepsilon^3 ) \\label{eq : exphab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the following choice is particularly useful @xmath72 this choice is motivated because @xmath73 and @xmath74 individually separate into sublattices which contain only 2 sites each @xmath75 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(t_3+v_3+t_4+v_4\\right ) + v_{3,4}\\right ] + ... \\nonumber\\\\ & = & h_{1,2 } + h_{3,4 } + ... \\nonumber\\\\ h_b&= & \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(t_2+v_2+t_3+v_3\\right ) + v_{2,3}\\right ] + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(t_4+v_4+t_5+v_5\\right ) + v_{4,5}\\right ] + ... \\nonumber\\\\ & = & h_{2,3 } + h_{4,5 } + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. both @xmath73 and @xmath74 are sums of commuting operators and can be easily diagonalized and exponentiated numerically ! this task is facilitated even more by the fact that @xmath76 , @xmath77 etc .",
    "each satisfy longitudinal momentum conservation , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 etc .",
    "are all block diagonal in the dlcq basis , where the blocks are labeled by the sum of momenta on sites 1 and 2 , etc . !",
    "once one has constructed @xmath68 one can proceed to evaluate physical observables in the ground state , using @xmath78 for the ground state energy and @xmath79 for any other observable , provided @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the results thus obtained still depend on @xmath82 because @xmath68 has been approximated only up to @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 limit can be obtained by extrapolation .",
    "the above products are evaluated as follows .",
    "first one inserts a complete set of states at each @xmath82-step , e.g. @xmath85 where the @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) are a direct product of complete sets of states at each site .",
    "the vector notation is used to label these states where the n - th component of @xmath88 refers to the longitudinal momentum on the n - th site and the n - th component of @xmath89 refers to the internal excitation level on this n - th site with a given momentum dimensional field theory attached to each site , i.e. for each site - momentum many different states are possible . ] for example for a lattice with 4 sites a randomly picked state could look like this : @xmath90 which would mean that site one carries @xmath91 longitudinal momentum , site two @xmath92 unit , etc . while the internal excitation numbers are @xmath92 ( for zero momentum there is only one state  the vacuum ) , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively .",
    "of course one can chose many other ways to enumerate the basis but i found the above method the easiest to implement in a computer code .    in this work ,",
    "a free fock space basis has been selected to represent the internal excitations at each site because structure functions are diagonal only in a free fock space basis",
    ". however , many other choices are conceivable as well .",
    "in fact , in many cases it may be more efficient numerically to chose some kind of interacting basis on the sites instead of a free basis . particularly if one is more interested in energy eigenvalues or observables other than structure functions .",
    "several monte carlo techniques are available to perform the summations in eq.([eq : evolv ] ) .",
    "i have tried the projector monte carlo method @xcite as well as the ensemble projector monte carlo method @xcite . in the projector monte carlo method , in each sweep one starts from a state @xmath95 which is randomly picked with probability @xmath96 . in the next step one",
    "picks a state @xmath97 with probability @xmath98 .",
    "the probabilities chosen in this work are ) useful numerically . ]",
    "@xmath99 where @xmath100 for @xmath101 or @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 . can be combined into one step with @xmath106 . ] since @xmath107 factorizes into two - site sublattices , so does the transition probability @xmath108 .",
    "for example , suppose ( on a lattice with @xmath109 sites ) @xmath110 and suppose @xmath100 .",
    "then one first selects @xmath111 and thus restricts the possible choices . ] with probability proportional to latexmath:[\\[\\left|<i_{l+1}^1 , k_{l+1}^1 , i_{l+1}^2 , k_{l+1}^2| e^{- \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2 } h_{1,2 } }    be done with a metropolis algorithm .",
    "then one applies the same procedure to sites 3 and 4 .",
    "having thus `` updated '' the entire lattice one proceeds to the next @xmath82-step where @xmath113 .",
    "this time it is sites 2 and 3 as well as sites 4 and 1 which interact with another . and so on until one reaches @xmath114 .",
    "for such a `` path ''",
    "one then computes the product @xmath115 where @xmath116 and the `` scores '' at each step are the actual transition amplitudes ( the matrix elements of @xmath107 ) divided by the `` probabilities '' @xmath117 these products of scores ( [ eq : stimess ] ) are then averaged over many sweeps . similarly one computes the numerators in eqs.([eq : hpath ] ) ( [ eq : opath ] ) .",
    "for example , if one wants to calculate a structure function , one averages over the product of scores times the structure function measured somewhere near the middle of the path and divides the result by the average of the product of scores .",
    "the disadvantage of the projector monte carlo method is that once a small `` score '' occurs along a path , the whole product for the path will contribute negligibly to the sum of paths , i.e. the path integral will be dominated by a few paths which do not contain any small element and the relative statistical fluctuations in the path thus increase linearly with the number of steps in the path @xcite .",
    "since on the other hand one is interested in making the path as long as possible in order to project onto the ground state while keeping @xmath82 small to avoid systematic errors , the projector monte carlo method turns out to be rather inefficient . a variation of this method , the ensemble projector monte carlo method suffers less from this problem .",
    "there one starts form an ensemble of states at step 1 .",
    "the probabilities and scores are calculated for each member of the ensemble in the same way as for the projector monte carlo method . however , after each @xmath82-step , when one calculates the scores , one replicates and deletes members of the ensemble by the following rule : first one calculates the average score @xmath118 ( ensemble average ) .",
    "then one replicates each state @xmath119 in the ensemble with multiplicity @xmath120 , \\label{eq : multi}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the score for the transition to state @xmath119 .",
    "this way , any path where a very small score occurs will most likely be eliminated ( and no further computer time will be wasted on this path ) while important paths branch out and contribute with multiple weight . note that the size of the population is not fixed because the states are replicated with a multiplicity that depends on a random number . in general",
    ", the population thus fluctuates .",
    "sometimes , the population grows or shrinks slowly . in order to keep the population stable on",
    "the average one can counterbalance the growing / shrinking by choosing @xmath118 in eq.([eq : multi ] ) a little larger / smaller than the average score .    for the path integral one only has to evaluate the sign of the scores",
    "@xmath122 the absolute values of the scores along the path are already taken into account since they determined the multiplicities in the random walk ( [ eq : multi ] ) .",
    "observables are calculated similarly as in the projector monte carlo method except that one now averages over both the ensemble and the sweeps . for the efficiency of the algorithm , it is important to start the random walk with a good initial guess for the ground state @xmath123 . for many light - front hamiltonians",
    "the exact ground state wavefunction has a sizeable overlap with the valence configuration . as a first try",
    ", it may thus be useful to make a valence ansatz for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this will also be the choice in this work . for more complicated theories one can also try to improve the valence ansatz for @xmath123 by including higher fock components perturbatively .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath32 contains two dimensionful parameters : the bare mass @xmath125 and the coupling constant @xmath126 ( which also carries dimension of mass ) and hence an arbitrary scale @xmath127 , specifying the units in which these dimensionful parameters are measured . in the following",
    ", the scale will be fixed by demanding that @xmath128 for the lightest physical particle .",
    "all other dimensionful quantities ( e.g. @xmath126 or @xmath129 ) will be measured in these units . after fixing the physical mass scale , which determines the bare mass",
    ", there is still ( in the continuum limit ) one dimensionless parameter left : @xmath130 . in my numerical work",
    "i have considered two extreme cases : @xmath131 and @xmath132 corresponding to intermediate and strong coupling respectively .",
    "the case @xmath131 turned out to be rather boring because the structure function of the lightest physical particle is strongly dominated by a `` bare '' excitation @xmath133 .",
    "deviations from this pointlike structure can be well approximated by summing a chain of `` setting suns''(fig.[oyster ] ) .",
    "although this result was reproduced in the monte carlo calculations , it will not be discussed here any further because the real strength of the monte carlo method lies more in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "@xmath132 will thus be chosen throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the numerical calculations were done as follows : after selecting the coupling constant ( @xmath132 ) and choosing a transverse lattice ( characterized by the spacing @xmath134 and by the number of sites ) and after selecting a value for the `` damping parameter '' @xmath82 , the bare masses were determined by imposing the renormalization condition @xmath135 . within the dlcq formalism used here this yields bare masses which show some dependence on the longitudinal momentum .",
    "for @xmath136 there is no interaction and @xmath137 implies @xmath138 . in the next step the bare mass @xmath139 for @xmath140",
    "is determined by requiring @xmath141 ( keeping @xmath142 ) fixed ) .",

    "`` mesons '' was used @xmath150 this choice ( which corresponds to the valence approximation in @xmath31 ) was motivated by the fact that the physical ground state particle in @xmath32 can be interpreted as a dressed single particle state .",

    "( to insure statistically independent sampling ) by separately taking the ensemble average of the numerator and the denominator in eq.([eq : hpath ] ) .",

    "typical ( statistical ) errors with these parameters where of the order of @xmath155 for @xmath153 and thus also for the bare masses .",
    "whenever @xmath67 , evaluated using eq.([eq : mphys ] ) deviated significantly from @xmath127 ( the renormalization condition ) the bare masses where adjusted accordingly .",
    "this procedure was repeated for @xmath156 and for lattices with @xmath157 and @xmath158 transverse sites and for transverse spacings @xmath159 .",
    "it turned out that the bare masses depend only very weakly on @xmath82 and @xmath160 which made the tuning rather easy .",
    "the tuning was facilitated even more by the fact that the path integral can still be summed up numerically exactly ( without monte carlo ) for lattices with four sites ( and @xmath161 ) .",
    "furthermore , one can estimate the difference between 4-site lattices and larger lattices by perturbative methods before one starts the nonperturbative tuning using the monte carlo . for @xmath162 and large @xmath58",
    "the energy measurement described above became too noisy due to the sign problem discussed at the end of section [ sec : mcalg ] .",
    "for these cases , i used a slightly different algorithm : instead of evolving the initial state for @xmath163-steps and sampling the energy every fifth step , the initial state was evolved only for @xmath164-steps .",
    "this procedure was then repeated 2000 times to obtain the same statistical sample size for the energies as in the first method .",
    "the advantage of the second procedure is the following .",
    "since only a few ( small ) matrix elements of @xmath68 are negative , it is not very likely to encounter a negative score in a given `` path '' ( [ eq : sprod ] )  unless the path is very long . with this scenario",
    "it is clear that procedure two ( starting over and over again from the same initial state ) has much less of a sign problem than procedure one ( continued evolution ) .",
    "however , typically it takes more @xmath82-steps to project onto the ground state from @xmath123 ( [ eq : psiif ] ) than it takes to get uncorrelated energy measurements .",
    "it thus depends on the concrete example which of the two procedures is more efficient .    after completing the renormalization for a given set of parameters ( @xmath165 )",
    "one can proceed to evaluate physical observables . at this point",
    "let me introduce the `` structure functions '' for scalar fields . in analogy",
    "to definitions of parton distributions in @xmath4 one can introduce @xmath166 as the light - cone momentum density of elementary quanta in the state @xmath167 but this point will not be discussed here any further . ] .",
    "the normalization is such that the momentum sum rule reads @xmath168 . upon discretizing the structure function",

    "second , since the wavefunction renormalization in @xmath32 is finite , there is a finite probability to find the physical `` meson '' as a bare state .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit , @xmath172 should contain a @xmath54-function at @xmath174 with finite coefficient ( in the structure function plots in this work this point will always be excluded because it would lie outside the chosen plotframe ) . besides the @xmath54-function one expects a continuum because the bare state can always split into three `` partons '' ( via the @xmath31-interaction ) which can split again and so on .",
    "while lowest order perturbation theory suggests a structure function that is peaked around @xmath175 , higher order effects ( multifragmentation ) will shift the maximum towards smaller values of @xmath176 .",
    "structure functions were evaluated by averaging over @xmath147 sweeps ( except for @xmath177 where structure functions were averaged over 20000 sweeps ) where again an ensemble size of @xmath146 was used .",
    "each sweep consisted of @xmath178-steps .",
    "also @xmath179 eq.([eq : psiif ] ) was used again . the operator to measure the structure functions was inserted after the first @xmath180-steps for each member of the ensemble . ) .",
    "hence `` measuring the structure function '' means evaluating it at a few points ( [ eq : fdlcq ] ) . ] for the remaining steps of the random walk , a record is kept of the result of this structure function measurement from which each subsequent ensemble member has evolved @xcite .",
    "finally , the result for the measurement of @xmath172 in this sweep is obtained by separately evaluating the ensemble average of the numerator and the denominator in eq.([eq : opath ] ) .",
    "this result is then averaged over the sweeps . in order to investigate convergence with respect to the number of @xmath82-steps in the final state",
    ", this number was kept variable ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "typical results for such a structure function measurement , as a function of the number of @xmath82-steps before taking the overlap with @xmath182 , are shown in fig.[plateau ] .",
    "for all values of @xmath82 used in this work , the plateau sets in before @xmath164-steps , i.e. the ground state expectation value of the structure function can be extracted from these results .",
    ", conclusions about convergence in the final state can also be applied to the convergence in the initial state as well .",
    "] there are several reasons for this rapid convergence .",
    "first , even for @xmath183 , the true ground state has a large overlap with the bare state @xmath184 ( [ eq : psiif ] ) .",
    "furthermore , any contamination of @xmath184 with excited states is filtered out very efficiently because higher states are suppressed by the square of their masses @xmath185 the lowest excited state with the same quantum numbers as @xmath184 is a scattering state consisting of @xmath93 ground state mesons with a threshold at @xmath186 ( i.e. @xmath187 ! ) .",
    "for example , after @xmath188 steps with @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 the ground state is enhanced by a factor of @xmath192 compared to the first excited state .",
    "since most of the `` contamination '' comes not from the threshold itself but from many higher excited states , the filtering process is even more efficient than this numerical example illustrates .    since the structure functions turned out to have converged already after @xmath164-steps in the final state ,- steps would also have been sufficient in the initial state .",
    "however , this was not clear before the calculations were completed . ] the measurements for @xmath172 with @xmath193 final steps were then averaged .",
    "note that these measurements are statistically correlated .",
    "the statistical error for the average result was estimated by taking the statistical error for the measurement after @xmath164-steps in the final state ( the statistical error almost does not change from step 10 to 15 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[kscale]-[ascale ] .",
    "first one has to make sure that the longitudinal momentum @xmath58 was large enough . in fig.[kscale ] results with @xmath194 and @xmath191 are compared for some typical choices of the other parameters .",
    "one can easily imagine that the @xmath194 and the @xmath191 results lie almost on the same smooth curve , indicating that @xmath191 is large enough . in fig.[nscale",
    "] it is demonstrated how the results converged as a function of the number of sites .",
    "note that ( with the exception of @xmath195 and @xmath109 , which were done numerically exactly ) although the same number of sweeps and size of the ensemble were used for all values of @xmath160 , the statistical error bars increase only very slowly with @xmath160 .",
    "the same is true for the cpu - time required for the monte carlo calculation .",
    "the reason is that the light - cone vacuum far away from physical particles is trivial .",
    "thus there are no statistical fluctuations arising from `` updating the vacuum '' on huge lattices ( much larger than the transverse size of the particles ) .",
    "the @xmath82-dependence is illustrated in fig.[escale ] .",
    "one way to understand fig.[escale ] is to evaluate the double commutator which governs the @xmath83 corrections in eq.([eq : exphab ] ) .",
    "the rather lengthy expression will not be given here , but one can immediately guess the basic features .",
    "first , it is the hopping term @xmath196 which gives rise to a nonvanishing commutator in @xmath197 $ ] , which `` explains '' the increase of the finite @xmath82 corrections with decreasing @xmath198 : fig.[escale ] a ) vs. b ) ( of course , in order to be quantitative one has to to evaluate the matrix elements which could show an @xmath198 dependence as well from the wavefunctions ) .",
    "furthermore , the double commutator contains terms which spread over up to @xmath109 transverse sites .",
    "it is thus not surprising to find a difference between the finite @xmath82 effects on 4-site and larger lattices : fig.[escale ] a ) vs. c ) .",
    "finally one has to take the @xmath199 limit ( fig.[ascale ] ) .",
    "this is the most difficult part because one first has to make sure that everything else has converged for fixed @xmath198 .",
    "as discussed above , this requires smaller @xmath82 for smaller @xmath198 ( hence more steps to project onto the ground state and hence more computer time ) .",
    "the required number of lattice sites also increases with decreasing @xmath198 .",
    "furthermore , since the coupling between sites goes like @xmath200 , the statistical fluctuations induced by this term increase as @xmath198 decreases .",
    "an additional reason for the increase of the statistical fluctuations with decreasing @xmath198 may lie in the choice of probabilities ( [ eq : prob ] ) . on a two site lattice ,",
    "the coupling between the two sites is twice as strong as between adjacent sites on a larger lattice ( one step on the lattice in either direction leads to the same result on a two - site lattice with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "thus the two site amplitudes tend to overemphasize highly excited states ( compared to the actual physical situation on a large lattice ) . since this `` driving force '' away from the ground state increases with smaller @xmath198 , an increase in the statistical fluctuations results .",
    "evidently , there is still room to improve the algorithm chosen here .",
    "however , since the purpose of this work is only a feasibility study and since the most useful choice for the probabilities ( [ eq : prob ] ) is expected to depend on the theory under consideration , this point will not be elaborated on here any further .    in general , one would extrapolate the results first to @xmath201 and @xmath84 and then analyze the @xmath198-dependence of the extrapolated results .",
    "here this is not necessary because the above results demonstrate that @xmath202 and @xmath203 are already close enough to the continuum limit for @xmath204 .",
    "thus one can directly use these results without having to extrapolate .    while the structure function still changes significantly as one goes from @xmath205 to @xmath206 , there is only a slight difference ( at very small @xmath176 and the slight `` shoulder '' around @xmath207 ) between @xmath206 and @xmath208 , i.e. for @xmath209 the numerical results ( fig.[ascale ] ) are almost independent of @xmath198 which shows that the small @xmath198 scaling region has been reached .",
    "notice that the wave function renormalization in @xmath32 is finite and thus structure functions scale to a finite limit as @xmath210 ( corresponding to @xmath211 ) ; i.e. there is no logarithmic evolution for @xmath32 ( if there were logarithmic evolution then the probability to find the state in the valence configuration would tend to zero as @xmath212 ) .",
    "the shape of these structure functions can be understood as follows .",
    "with lowest order perturbation theory ( fragmentation : valence state @xmath213 3 partons ) one obtains a structure function which has a maximum near @xmath214 .",
    "once one includes the ( nonperturbative ) interactions within the three particle sector , the structure function becomes smeared out .",
    "the rise at very small @xmath176 can only be understood from multiple fragmentation processes .",
    "the `` shoulder '' near @xmath215 is a nonperturbative effect .",
    "it arises because the repulsive @xmath31 interaction tends to enhance components of the wavefunction with a node in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this also explains why the shoulder is absent for lattices with @xmath109 or less sites .",
    "the reason is that parity and bose symmetry require that a node in the longitudinal direction is accompanied by a node in the transverse direction . on a small lattice ,",
    "components of the wavefunction with a node in the transverse direction have a very large kinetic energy and are thus suppressed .",
    "the @xmath160-dependence of the results ( fig.[nscale ] ) indicates that the physical states have a transverse extension of about @xmath216 in the above units ( i.e. @xmath217 lattice spacings for @xmath177 ) because for lattices with a larger physical volumes , there is no significant volume dependence of physical observables .",
    "however , for more detailed information one would have to measure transverse density density correlation functions .",
    "i have shown that it is perfectly feasible to perform a monte carlo calculation for a light - front hamiltonian formulated as a dlcq problem on a transverse lattice .",
    "the transverse lattice was used to separate longitudinal and transverse dynamics .",
    "the dynamics within the longitudinal `` sheets '' attached to each transverse lattice point was solved using dlcq and conventional matrix diagonalization algorithms .",
    "the transverse dynamics was then included by means of monte carlo techniques . for this purpose , the light - cone imaginary time evolution operator @xmath218 was approximated by breaking up the light - front hamiltonian @xmath18 into two terms ( @xmath219 ) , each of which contains only interactions between pairs of sites .",
    "@xmath220 is then evaluated by alternating application of infinitesimal `` evolution''-operators generated by @xmath221 respectively . for calculating the actual path - integral , a variation of the ensemble projector",
    "monte carlo technique was used .",
    "+ in this whole program it was crucial that the longitudinal momentum @xmath20 was conserved , otherwise the light - front hamiltonian @xmath18 has no minimum corresponding to a physically meaningful particle solution .",
    "this was the major reason to use dlcq to solve the longitudinal dynamics and not , for example , a longitudinal lattice .",
    "it was furthermore crucial that the transverse lattice action is local , i.e. it involves only interactions between neighboring sites .",
    "on the one hand , due to the locality , it was thus possible to perform the abovementioned breakup of the light front hamiltonian @xmath219 in such a way that @xmath221 each can be written as direct sums of hamiltonians acting on 2-sites - lattices . thus @xmath221 can be easily diagonalized and exponentiated numerically .",
    "the locality of the transverse dynamics was furthermore important when updating the states at each monte carlo step .",
    "this is because locality of the interaction allowed to formulate the updating of the states at each @xmath82-step as a sequence of independent local updatings ( this will also be important when running the algorithm on parallel computers ) .",
    "the advantages of the algorithm introduced in this paper are as follows : most importantly , structure functions are diagonal in the dlcq basis used here and are thus easy to evaluate numerically .",
    "furthermore , since the light - front momentum @xmath20 is manifestly conserved , and since the vacuum has @xmath222 , physical particle states are always manifestly orthogonal to the vacuum .",
    "thus the monte carlo procedure will always converge to the particle solution with lowest invariant mass for that particular value of @xmath20 ( and the same discrete quantum numbers as the initial state ) .",
    "in addition , since the light - front vacuum is trivial , no computer time is `` wasted '' to solve for the vacuum surrounding a physical particle while one is interested in the particle only ( an annoyance for very large euclidean lattices ) .",
    "another advantage of using the light - front hamiltonian in the monte carlo procedure is that excited states are suppressed by the square of their masses : @xmath223 ( instead of @xmath224 which one encounters in a conventional hamiltonian formulation ) .",
    "thus fewer steps are necessary to filter out the ground state .",
    "the transverse lattice formulation also avoids part of the species doubling problem for fermions because doublers occur only for the latticized transverse directions .",
    "thus at most four species of fermions are generated if one starts from the naive fermion action in @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "hence , by means of staggering , one can easily get to two light flavors of fermions @xcite .",
    "one of the main disadvantages of the new method are the occurrence of a few negative matrix - elements in the infinitesimal evolution operator ( although its eigenvalues are of course still positive ) .",
    "thus negative scores resulted occasionally which slightly increased the fluctuations of the signal .",
    "it is expected that this problem gets worse once fermions are introduced because of the minus sign in exchange terms ( of course this then is nothing but the usual sign problem for fermions ) .",
    "another disadvantage is the explicit breaking of the symmetry between longitudinal and transverse directions which makes it difficult to recover full lorentz invariance in the continuum limit .",
    "although this was no problem in @xmath32 , it will be difficult to obtain lorentz invariant physical results in general ( for theories where the fundamental particles carry spin ) .",
    "numerous extensions of this work are conceivable .",
    "first of all , there is no profound difficulty to extend the formalism from @xmath2 to @xmath24 dimensions .",
    "of course , in @xmath24 dimensions @xmath219 has to be decomposed in such a way that @xmath221 each can be written as direct sums of hamiltonians on 1-plaquette lattices .",
    "another difference is the dependence of the numerical results on the lattice spacing @xmath198 : since @xmath32 has a finite wave function renormalization , scaling is exact which implies that the structure functions approach a finite limit for @xmath211 .",
    "of course in a renormalizable theory ( like @xmath4 ) this will not be the case and the structure functions will diverge as @xmath211  corresponding to the logarithmic evolution in @xmath225 .",
    "however , at least in principle , this is not a problem because one can always perform the monte carlo calculations with smaller and smaller spacing @xmath198 until one can match on to the perturbative evolution . since scaling in @xmath64 sets in at moderate @xmath225 values already , there is reason to expect that this is also possible in practice ( i.e. numerically practical ) .    in this work",
    "i have investigated only the projector and the ensemble projector monte carlo method because these are rather straightforward to apply to dlcq problems . for more complicated field theories",
    ", it may be necessary to use more efficient techniques , like guided random walks @xcite in the monte carlo procedure .",
    "one could also imagine combining the monte carlo technique presented in this work with renormalization group techniques .",
    "on the one hand this means using perturbative renormalization group arguments to facilitate the determination of the effective coupling constants in the light - front hamiltonian . on the other hand one could use the monte carlo procedure to perform nonperturbative studies of renormalization group flow for light - front hamiltonians without having to resort to uncontrolled truncations of the fock space .",
    "similarly , it is conceivable that monte carlo results are helpful in determining the effective coupling constants for the tamm - dancoff approach to solving light - front field theories . besides structure functions",
    ", one can also use lfepmc to calculate valence wavefunctions which have many interesting applications to various exclusive hard scattering processes @xcite .",
    "however , the main question is whether one can apply the light - front ensemble projector monte carlo to @xmath64 . here",
    "the main difficulty which remains is formulating compact ( to render the transverse lattice action gauge invariant ) @xmath4 on a transverse lattice using dlcq or to construct another approximation to @xmath4 on a transverse lattice which is suitable for dlcq . once one knows the dlcq hamiltonian for @xmath4 , it is straightforward to apply the monte carlo technique presented in this work",
