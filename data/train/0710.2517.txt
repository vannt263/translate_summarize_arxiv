    "one of the major insights of string theory is the unexpected connection between black hole physics and confinement in qcd .",
    "this connection is realized on the basis of the deep holographic  @xcite duality between gravity and gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting connection between black holes and gauge theories is the dual interpretation  @xcite of the hawking  page phase transition  @xcite in gravity as the confinement / deconfinement transition in gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "holography is based on a very concrete set of rules for computing quantum field theory expectation values in terms of classical solutions to sugra equations with concrete boundary conditions .",
    "a further important ingredient of holography is the generalization of the gauge  gravity correspondence to non local observables such as wilson or polyakov loops . in this ` non local ' version of the correspondence expectation values of wilson loops are defined as sums of string world sheets in the bulk geometry with boundary determined by the loop .",
    "wilson loops are natural candidates to define the order parameter of qcd phases .",
    "this is the case not only for confinement but also for the transition from a dilute gas of partons to the so",
    " called ` color glass condensate '  @xcite of hadronic parton distributions . in the same way as there exists a geometrical qualitative picture of the transition to confinement , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ geometries ] , it is natural to search for the corresponding holographic description of the saturation phenomena present in the high energy limit of qcd  @xcite .",
    "a very important experimental discovery in hera data was the rise of the gluon distribution function @xmath1 ( which is related to the number of gluons in the target proton wave function with effective transverse size of order @xmath2 carrying a fraction @xmath0 of the hadron longitudinal momentum ) when , for fixed @xmath3 , the value of @xmath0 becomes small .",
    "this can be seen , _",
    "e.g. _ , in fig .",
    "[ hera ] .    in the",
    "` dipole frame ' the total cross section for the scattering of the virtual photon off the hadron can be expressed in terms of the probability amplitude for the photon to decay into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair , creating a colour dipole of size @xmath4 , which then scatters off the proton s effective colour field .",
    "the forward scattering amplitude for the dipole depends on @xmath5 and the rapidity variable @xmath6 . in the leading order approximation",
    "this scattering amplitude depends linearly on @xmath1 .",
    "since unitarity requires the forward scattering amplitude not to be larger than one this indicates that the rise of the gluon distribution should reach a saturation point , leading to the kinematic diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ kinematic ] , where the saturation line indicates the critical value @xmath7 such that for @xmath8 and fixed @xmath3 the gluon distribution function becomes effectively constant in @xmath0 .",
    "the two main theoretical problems associated with the previous picture are to identify @xmath9 the dynamical origin of the rise of @xmath1 with decreasing @xmath0 and @xmath10 the nature of the non  linear dynamics responsible for saturation and restoration of unitarity .",
    "the current understanding is that the dynamical origin of the rise of the gluon distribution function is due to the dominance of bfkl dynamics  @xcite while the non  linear bk equation  @xcite is responsible for the onset of saturation effects in the high energy limit of scattering amplitudes . in the eikonal approximation",
    "the exponential rise in @xmath11 for the forward scattering amplitude can be computed as the wilson loop for the quark ",
    "antiquark pair propagating in the effective colour field of the proton which , in the proton infinite momentum frame and large center  of  mass energies , is dominated by soft gluon emissions in multi  regge kinematics , with strong ordering in longitudinal components but not in transverse ones .",
    "these configurations , shown in fig .  [ cascade ] , build up the bfkl hard pomeron .",
    "in this framework the rapidity @xmath11 acts as a cutoff in the effective integration over longitudinal momenta and the bfkl equation controlling the evolution in @xmath11 plays the conceptual rle of a renormalization group equation with a ` fixed point ' , generated by non ",
    "linear effects , at the saturation line .",
    "this line , of the form @xmath12 , is characterized by the ` saturation exponent ' , which , in the limit of a very small coupling , reads @xmath13 .",
    "a direct consequence of the onset of non  linear effects is that asymptotic amplitudes only depend on the variable @xmath14 nearby the saturation region , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the @xmath15 plane this implies that physical observables only depend on lines of constant @xmath16 as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ saturation ] . along those lines",
    "any continuous boost in longitudinal components can be compensated by an equivalent one in the transverse directions to leave physical quantities invariant .",
    "our target is to find the holographic dual of the saturation line  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the wilson loop picture of the forward scattering amplitude for the dipole , the holographic representation of this quantity leads us to sum over world sheet amplitudes for a certain bulk geometry  @xcite .",
    "since the dynamics we want to describe in gravity dual terms is the rapidity dependence of the amplitude , we will formally consider a background metric depending on the dual variable to @xmath11 in such a way that in the transition from the dilute to the dense or saturated regime it manifests some sort of ` geometric scaling ' in terms of properly chosen holographic variables . to establish the correspondence correctly this scaling",
    "must be characterized by a critical quantity related to the saturation exponent @xmath20 .",
    "a first hint in this direction was shown in  @xcite .",
    "there it was argued that in the numerical studies of black hole formation for the spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field carried out by choptuik  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) there appears a critical exponent very similar to @xmath20 . in particular",
    ", if we denote by @xmath21 a generic parameter describing the initial radial density for imploding scalar waves , choptuik found that there are critical lines in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , such that , if @xmath23 the scalar wave packet implodes through @xmath24 and then disperses into flat space  time .",
    "but if @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ , the ` supercritical ' case , then after the implosion there is a fraction of field which forms a small black hole .",
    "the interesting point is that its radius scales as @xmath26 , and it turns out that precisely in dimension five @xmath27 .    nonetheless , there is a difficulty to map the collapse of a scalar field with qcd , namely , the metric and field components obtained in this case manifest ` discrete self  similarity '",
    "this means that a similar variable as the above  mentioned @xmath16 leaves physical observables invariant under the transformation @xmath28 , with @xmath29 a constant which has no analogue in four dimensional high energy scattering .",
    "we have investigated in detail a different type of gravitational collapse which has self  similarity , in this case ` continuous self  similarity ' ( css ) : the spherical collapse of a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state .",
    "the einstein s equations together with matter s equations of motion in @xmath30 dimensions can be solved assuming a unique dependence on the variable @xmath31 . as an example we discuss the function @xmath32 which is proportional to the ratio of the mean density inside the sphere of radius @xmath5 to the local density at @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ cssyrt ] it can be seen how @xmath32 maintains a constant @xmath5profile for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the solution is css since any change in the time coordinate can be compensated by a change in @xmath5 keeping @xmath34 unchanged .",
    "this css property is what we associate with ` geometric scaling ' in qcd , with @xmath33 and @xmath5 being , respectively , the holographic duals of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in qcd .",
    "the choptuik exponent characterizing the black hole radius can be obtained by searching for liapunov modes of instability of the css solution . in fig .",
    "[ pertcssyr ] we show how the exponentially growing mode removes css from the solution to the collapse .",
    "the rate of growth of this mode is given by a coefficient which coincides with choptuik s exponent .",
    "we have numerically extracted this coefficient in the five dimensional case and proven that it is very close to the qcd saturation exponent in the limit of traceless energy ",
