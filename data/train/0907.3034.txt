    "microquasars are x - ray binaries which contain relativistic jets which are detected and resolved thanks to their non - thermal radio emission",
    ". the canonical example of a microquasar is grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "its multi - wavelength observations from radio to x - rays have shown a very complex behavior .",
    "in particular , a rich phenomenology observed in the radio domain includes radio quiet states , prolonged phases of relatively bright emission from a compact jet , the strong radio flares associated with major ejections in the superluminal jets and rapid radio oscillations .",
    "strong observational evidence exists that superluminal jets in galactic sources are places where particles can be accelerated to very high energies ( vhe ) @xcite . if such acceleration takes place in the jet of grs 1915 + 105 , @xcite predicted that grs 1915 + 105 could emit vhe gamma - rays for a few days , starting from an ejection event traced by a strong radio flare .",
    "the estimated power of the jets in grs 1915 + 105 exceeds @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 @xcite . only a small fraction of this jet power",
    "needs to be converted to vhe gamma - rays to produce a detectable signal .",
    "a detection of vhe emission from another microquasar , cyg x-1 , was reported by the magic collaboration .",
    "it occurred during a serendipitous bright x - ray flare that lasted several days @xcite .    here",
    "we report and discuss h.e.s.s .",
    "observations of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "h.e.s.s . is an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes situated in the khomas highland of namibia .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 was observed between year 2004 and 2008 on several occasions , as a target of opportunity ( too ) or as a field of view source in other h.e.s.s .",
    "pointings . after applying the standard h.e.s.s .",
    "data quality selection criteria @xcite a total of 24.1 hours live time were available for the analysis .",
    "the zenith angle of the observations changed between @xmath3 and @xmath4 with a mean value of @xmath5 .",
    "the pointing offsets varied from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . in accordance with h.e.s.s .",
    "guidelines , all the results presented below have been successfully cross - checked with an independent analysis and calibration chain .",
    "we performed a point source analysis at the location of the source using the standard analysis techniques and selection cuts with an angular cut of @xmath8 and a size cut of 80 photo - electrons @xcite .",
    "the post - analysis energy threshold at @xmath9 is 410 gev . to estimate the background we used the reflected background method for all the observational runs @xcite .",
    "the total number of source and background events is @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively ( with background to source normalization equal 0.067 ) , which results in an excess of -5.93 events .",
    "the significance of the excess from the direction of grs 1915 + 105 , calculated using eq .",
    "( 17 ) of @xcite , is @xmath12 standard deviations .",
    "[ map ] shows a significance map around the position of grs 1915 + 105 and fig .",
    "[ thetaplot ] the distribution of the squared angular distance of observed gamma - ray candidates from the center of the binary in comparison to background data .",
    "the angular distribution of the source region events is compatible with the distribution of the background regions events .",
    "we conclude , that there is no evidence for a vhe gamma - ray signal from the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 .     and",
    "the map has been smoothed with a two - dimensional gaussian of radius 0.65@xmath13 .",
    "the triangles denote grs 1915 + 105 and the two iras sources , candidates for jet - ism interaction sites .",
    "the dotted circle corresponds to an exclusion region around hess j1912 + 101 .",
    "the data inside not taken into account in background calculations.,width=240 ]    we used approach of @xcite to calculate the upper limits on the integrated photon flux above 410 gev . assuming a power law with photon index @xmath14 , the upper limit for the whole data set at the 99.9% confidence level is @xmath15 this corresponds to 0.71% of the crab nebula flux with the same energy threshold .",
    "the estimated systematic error on the flux measurements is 20% @xcite .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "upper limits translate into a vhe luminosity @xmath16 erg  s@xmath2 at the 9 kpc distance for the total dataset and @xmath17 erg  s@xmath2 for a 4@xmath18 detection in one hour .",
    "in grs 1915 + 105 , both discrete relativistic ejections and a compact jet could be associated with vhe emission . unlike cyg x-1 or ls 5039 , vhe photon absorption due to pair creation on stellar photons",
    "is not expected to be an issue in grs 1915 + 105 due to the low luminosity and temperature companion star .",
    "@xcite modelled the radio flares from grs 1915 + 105 as synchrotron emission of expanding plasmons ejected from the system . in the framework of the model , for an assumed acceleration of electrons to 10 tev and a sub - equipartition magnetic field of 0.05 g",
    ", the vhe gamma - ray flux is expected to be at the crab nebula flux during the first hours of a strong radio outburst , and to subsequently decline to @xmath19 10% of the crab flux over a period of a few days .",
    "these fluxes would be detectable with the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes .    due to the highly time - dependent character of the vhe emission",
    "it would be desirable to have observations simultaneous with one of the large , optically thin radio flares associated with major ejection events but these require long , dedicated campaigns of tens of days to increase chances of catching them . despite present efforts , these remain difficult to organise with ground - based cherenkov arrays .",
    "the vhe emission might be expected on phenomenological grounds from the steady , compact jet .",
    "the vhe flare observed in cyg x-1 @xcite occurred when the source was in the hard x - ray power - law state associated with a conical , continuous , self - absorbed compact jet @xcite .",
    "such a compact jet is also known to be produced in grs 1915 + 105 during long plateau states @xcite . however",
    ", a flare analogous to that in cyg x-1 , which in 153 minutes of observation time reached 4@xmath18 , could not have been detected .",
    "the future cherenkov telescope array with an order of magnitude higher sensitivity will be able to detect such a flare at 9 kpc .",
    "finally , a possible source of vhe gamma - ray emission are the two small radio and infrared clouds positioned nearly symmetrically with respect to grs 1915 + 105 at angular separation of 17 from the system ( see fig .",
    "[ map ] ) . because of their position angle being very similar to the position angle of the sub - arcsec radio jets from grs 1915 + 105",
    ", the clouds have been postulated to be associated with the termination of the jets in the ism @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for an excess vhe gamma - ray emission from any of the two sources .",
    "a more detailed analysis and discussion in the context of the established variability multi - wavelength behaviour of grs 1915 + 105 will be presented in the forthcoming paper .",
