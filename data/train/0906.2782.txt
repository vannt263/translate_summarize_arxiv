    "additionally , stitching together simulation slices to produce a view along the light - cone would unnecessarily add or subtract ( depending on the prescription used ) power from the spectrum on scales larger than the size of the simulation box and on the scale of the separation between simulation slices .",

    "the level of error in measuring the power informs whether the 1d power contains sufficient information to distinguish between galaxies of different masses and luminosities .",
    "this differentiability is important in constraining the mass - luminosity relationship and happens when the standard errors for each power spectrum using @xmath106 independent fields - of - view ( in this case all having dimensions of @xmath26 ) are small enough that they do nt overlap : @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the mean and standard deviations of the log of the power for the luminosity thresholds corresponding to @xmath110 . on the largest scales probed ,",

    "it is also clear that the flatness we noted in the simulated spectrum for the @xmath26 field - of - view is not generic ; the spectrum for the narrowest field - of - view first rises with @xmath80 and then decreases .",
    "the @xmath115 field - of - view produces a spectrum that is flatter than the one produced by the @xmath114 field - of - view , but since the peak is also at much larger scales , we end up probing the spectrum in the regime where it begins to fall off at small scales .",

    "in this work we have analyzed the statistics of galaxies in mock ",
    "pencil beam \" surveys of high - redshift lbgs and laes with narrow fields - of - view produced using n - body simulations .",
    "we computed the effect of sample variance and nonlinear bias and showed how these will influence measurements of galaxy counts in existing and upcoming surveys .    while the variance due to fluctuations in the local overdensity in lbg surveys increases almost monotonically with increasing luminosity ( or halo mass ) , it dominates only at low luminosities and is overtaken at high luminosities by a poisson variance that rises more steeply as the average number of galaxies in the survey drops .",
    "however , the overdensities become nonlinear on small scales .",
    "a given point is more likely to be in underdense regions than in overdense regions because of their larger volume filling fraction .",
    "the resulting skewness of the probability distribution of galaxy counts creates slightly more uncertainty in obtaining the true number density of galaxies at the observed redshift than would otherwise be expected .",
    "this can be seen graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdist8 - 10 ] where the simulation histogram is most closely matched by a skewed , log - normal distribution whose peak is centered on negative values of the overdensity .",
    "the skewness of the distribution and the resulting increased probability of surveying an underdense region should be taken into account when interpreting galaxy counts in the context of the ionizing uv background they produce at high redshift , or else it would result in an underestimate of the background .",
    "precise measurements of the cosmic variance in a survey is also important for understanding the differences between two independent samples .",
    "our results and methods can be used to calibrate these errors for different fields - of - view and survey depths appropriate to a given study instead of relying only on linear theory estimates at a single redshift as in @xcite .    whether or not future surveys of laes will have the angular resolution to compute angular correlation functions in the plane of the sky",
    ", they will probe many more modes along the line - of - sight .",
    "we expect the 1d power spectrum from surveys with a jwst - sized field - of - view to exhibit a roughly flat , smooth profile .",
    "aliasing and the averaging of many skewers are expected to result in a relatively featureless spectrum unable to probe void structure like that seen in @xcite .",
    "the flatness , on the other hand , is unique to the particular choice of field - of - view , and comparing jwst results , such as measurements of the galaxy bias , with those from other surveys will not be trivial due to the complicated convolution with the window function .",
    "nonetheless , if the survey parameters are known , the amplitude on the largest scales matches well with the expectation from linear theory .",
    "however , on small scales , the nonlinear bias becomes large .",
    "given their limited fields - of - view , a survey with jwst will need tens of pointings to be able to distinguish between host halo masses different by an order - of - magnitude limiting its usefulness in determining their mass - to - light ratios . finally ,",
    "our calculations ignored the complex effects of reionization on the amplitude of the power spectrum . the mass - to - light ratio for laes at redshifts during reionization could first be calibrated by extrapolating determinations made after reionization , through either clustering or abundance matching . with this information in hand",
    ", differences between our results and observations will show the effect of lyman-@xmath0 transmission through the hii regions around ionizing sources .",
    "however , probing reionization through the changing amplitude of the 1d spectrum @xcite will require particular consideration of the field - of - view .",
