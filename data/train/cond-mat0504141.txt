    "the concept of exchange interactions in almost - localized correlated fermions first appeared in the pioneering papers of heisenberg@xcite and was formulated in a more general mathematical way by dirac@xcite .",
    "although the early papers by dirac already contain the general expression of the hamiltonian in terms of n - particle permutations , no attention was paid , up to the sixties , to higher orders than the `` pair - exchange '' heisenberg term .",
    "thouless@xcite was the first to point out that higher order exchanges as three- and four - spin cyclic permutations might be important in quantum solids like @xmath1he .",
    "but only ten years later , striking experimental results on nuclear magnetism in the bcc phase of solid @xmath1he , in the millikelvin range@xcite , were interpreted by hetherington , delrieu and roger through a ring - exchange model with two- three- and four - particle interactions of comparable magnitude@xcite . from general considerations put forward by thouless , permutations of even parity ( like three - particle cycles ) induce ferromagnetism while odd permutations ( pair and four - particle exchanges ) favor antiferromagnetism , and the striking phase diagram of bcc solid @xmath1he corresponds to a highly frustrated quantum - spin system with competing three- and four - spin permutations . during the last two decades a lot of progress has been accomplished in the investigation of solid @xmath1he films adsorbed on graphite , a simple model system exhibiting even more frustration since the frustrated nature of ring - exchange interactions is enhanced by the frustrated geometry of the triangular lattice . the conceptual beauty of solid @xmath1he lies in the fact that the system is simple enough ( the pair interactions between @xmath1he atoms are mainly of hard core nature ) to allow the calculation of exchange frequencies from first principles@xcite and a quantitative comparison with experimental results .    the relevance of the multi - spin exchange concept is not restricted to the physics of nuclear @xmath1he spins .",
    "delrieu@xcite suggested that three - spin exchange might be dominant in the two - dimensional electron wigner solid near the quasi - classical limit , and this has been corroborated through wkb calculations@xcite .",
    "more recent monte - carlo simulations have proved that competing three and four - spin exchange interaction should occur near melting@xcite .",
    "the first fourth - order @xmath4 expansion of the one - band hubbard hamiltonian in terms of four - spin interactions has been published in 1977 by takahashi@xcite . soon after the discovery of high - t@xmath5 superconductors , roger and delrieu@xcite suggested , on the basis of an expansion of the three - band hubbard model , that four - spin exchange might be significant in the cuo@xmath2 planes of cuprates . during the last ten years",
    "many experimental results have revealed the presence of four - spin exchange interactions in the cu - o plaquettes of cuprates@xcite and copper - based spin - ladder materials@xcite .",
    "dirac formalism is introduced in the framework of degenerate perturbation theory . the hamiltonian is written @xmath6 , where @xmath7 describes independent particles and v is a perturbation .",
    "the `` unperturbed '' degenerate ground - states for n distinguishable particles can be written as products of independent particle states : @xmath8 .",
    "each of these states is itself a product of two kets corresponding to the orbital and spin variables respectively : @xmath9 @xmath10=@xmath11 appears as a product of an orbital wavefunction : @xmath12 and a spin wavefunction : @xmath13 simply represents the site occupied by the particle ( i ) .",
    "the permutation p of two particles can be expressed as a product of two operators : @xmath14 @xmath15 acting on orbitals and @xmath16 acting on spin variables .",
    "if the hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on the spin , we can as a first step concentrate on the orbital part of the wave function and solve the eigenvalue problem : @xmath17 for the orbital wavefunction @xmath18 describing n _",
    "distinguishable _ particles . the ground - state of the unperturbed part @xmath7 of the hamiltonian is n !",
    "fold degenerated and the corresponding subspace @xmath19 is spanned by the n ! states : @xmath20 represents a permutation @xmath21 of the n integers @xmath22 .",
    "we now apply degenerate perturbation theory@xcite to the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath23 . at first order , the splitting of the n !",
    "degenerated energy levels is given by the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath24 defined by its matrix elements : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two permutations of the symmetric group @xmath28 . since @xmath29 is invariant with respect to any permutation ,",
    "we can write : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and the eigenvalue problem , restricted to the subspace @xmath19 can be formally represented by the hamiltonian : @xmath32 where the summation runs over permutations @xmath15 of the symmetric group @xmath28 .",
    "this result extends straightforwardly to higher order degenerate perturbation theory : the higher orders are expressed in terms powers of @xmath29 and projection operator @xmath33 on @xmath19@xcite , and these operators commute with permutation operators .",
    "hence , at arbitrary order in degenerate perturbation theory , we can write : @xmath34    we now have to introduce the spin degrees of freedom an express that the global wavefunction is completely antisymmetric . as a general result from group theory a completely antisymmetric wave function",
    "can be expressed by the following bilinear expression@xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents a linear combination of different permutations @xmath37 corresponding to a given irreducible representation of the symmetry group schematized by a young diagram , while @xmath38 represents a linear combination of permutation @xmath39 corresponding to the representation associated with the `` complementary '' young diagram , obtained by exchanging the lines and the columns .",
    "for spin-1/2 , a complete antisymmetrisation of the spins can not be realised over more than 2 variables , hence the corresponding young diagrams have at most two lines and each diagram corresponds to a given value of the total spin @xmath40 .",
    "it is then possible to establish a correspondence between the expression [ eq .",
    "( 10 ) ] of the hamiltonian acting only on the orbital variables with an equivalent hamiltonian acting only on the spin variables . expressing the antisymmetry of the wave function : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the parity of the permutation , we can write : @xmath43 and multiplying to the left by @xmath44 : @xmath45 taking into account that in eq .",
    "( 10 ) @xmath15 and the inverse permutation @xmath44 appear with the same weight @xmath46 , the hamiltonian is written equivalently in spin space : @xmath47 where the sum is over all permutations of the symmetric group @xmath28 acting on spin variables .",
    "large u expansions of the one - band hubbard model@xcite have generally been performed within the framework of second quantization ( i.e working on the total antisymmetric wavefunction ) .",
    "dirac formalism allows a simpler and more physical derivation .",
    "we start with n distinguishable particles on n discrete sites , each site containing zero , one or two particles .",
    "there is an onsite coulomb energy @xmath48 for putting two particles on the same site , and each particle has a probability @xmath49 to hop from one site to the nearest neighbor .",
    "the hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on the spin variables .    in perturbation theory ,",
    "we start from the infinite @xmath48 limit : each site is occupied by one particle .",
    "since the particles are considered as distinguishable , the ground state is",
    "n ! fold degenerated .",
    "we apply degenerate perturbation theory to express the energy splitting as an expansion in @xmath4 when @xmath48 is large but finite@xcite . up to fourth",
    "order , the effective hamiltonian restricted to the subspace @xmath19 spanned by the n !",
    "fold degenerated ground states is written@xcite : @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the projection operator onto the subspace @xmath19 and @xmath52     in the fourth order expansion contribute to the cyclic exchange of the four particle coordinates @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "each of these four particle hops is accomplished by one of the four @xmath29 in the previous term and at each step a factor @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of doubly occupied sites , in the corresponding intermediate virtual state , has to be taken into account ( this factor arises from the operator @xmath40 ) .",
    "there are 4!=24 terms depending on the order in which the four hops 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , are successively realised .",
    "eight of them [ corresponding to the sequences ( 1324 ) , ( 1342 ) , ( 3124 ) , ( 3142 ) , ( 2413 ) , ( 4213 ) , ( 2431 ) , ( 4231 ) ] contribute to a factor @xmath59 , the sixteen others contribute to @xmath60 .",
    "the total contribution is then @xmath61 . ]",
    "this expression can be expanded in term of two , three and four - particle permutations @xmath15 acting on coordinates : @xmath62- & \\nonumber \\\\    k   \\sum_{<i , j , k , l > } [ p^r_{ijkl}+ ( p^r_{ijkl})^{-1 } ] & \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the square lattice .",
    "the sums in the first line are on first , second and third neighbor pairs respectively . the sum run over triangles in the second line and over square plaquettes in the last line . as a typical example , the fig .",
    "1 illustrates the evaluation of the four - particle cyclic permutation term .    since cyclic two and",
    "four - particle permutations are of odd parity , while three - particle permutations are even , we obtain the corresponding exchange hamiltonian , with permutation operators @xmath16 acting on spin variables : : @xmath68 + \\nonumber \\\\   & k   \\sum_{<i , j , k , l > } [ p^\\sigma_{ijkl}+ ( p^\\sigma_{ijkl})^{-1 } ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the identity : @xmath69 and the decomposition of any permutation in a product of transpositions , it is easy to check that this eq .",
    "16 is identical to the result given by takahashi .",
    "however our previous expression clearly separate the ferromagnetic contributions arising from three - particle exchange and the antiferromagnetic ones coming from pair- and four - particle exchange .",
    "the formulation in terms of permutation operators is also generally more convenient for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of a n - particle exchange hamiltonian .",
    "dirac formalism has been generalized by thouless for the exchange - problem in solid @xmath1he@xcite and by herring for many - electron systems @xcite .",
    "this has been applied later to ab - initio calculations of multi - spin exchange frequencies in solid @xmath1he and in the two - dimensional wigner - solid .",
    "a pioneering multidimensional wkb calculation of the exchange frequencies has been applied to the two - dimensional wigner solid near the quasi - classical limit@xcite .",
    "it has proved the conjecture by delrieu that three - particle exchange should dominate in that regime .",
    "although , at physical densities , solid @xmath1he is far from the quasi - classical regime , the same wkb approach was extrapolated with qualitative results concerning the hierarchy of various cyclic - exchange frequencies .    with the rapid increase of the performances of computers , ab - initio calculations of ring - exchange frequencies through path",
    "integral monte carlo ( pimc ) became possible .",
    "in contrast to wkb evaluation they are relevant to the whole range of physical densities , including solid phases near melting where quantum fluctuations are large .",
    "the exchange frequencies for bcc solid @xmath1he@xcite near melting , are in excellent agreement with the experimental thermodynamic properties , which can be inferred through exact high - temperature series expansions .",
    "although the long - range coulomb potential is completely different from the hard core potential between helium atoms , wkb calculations near the classical limit@xcite and pimc in the whole density range@xcite give striking analogies between solid @xmath1he films and the electron wigner solid , on the same triangular lattice .",
    "in both systems , three - particle exchange dominates near the quasi - classical limit , leading to ferromagnetism , while near melting , antiferromagnetic two- and four - particle exchange compete with ferromagnetic three - particle exchange leading to highly frustrated antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "close to melting , both systems might be prototypes of two - dimensional `` spin liquids''@xcite with no long range order at t=0 .",
    "experiments on the magnetism of the wigner solid are now at the very beginning@xcite , but the nuclear magnetism of solid @xmath1he films has now been extensively studied .",
    "exfoliated graphite offers large ( 10x10 nm ) flat crystallites with a strong adsorption potential for he .",
    "up to two solid he films can be adsorbed on this substrate , within a wide density - range .",
    "the magnetism of 2d helium films has been thoroughly studied , down to   10 - 100 @xmath70k in :    1 .",
    "submonolayer solid @xmath1he films on graphite@xcite 2 .",
    "solid @xmath1he films on graphite coated by a high density @xmath1he@xcite or @xmath71he@xcite layer or by a hd bilayer@xcite .",
    "the main difference between ( i ) and ( ii ) is that , due to a stronger adsorption potential , the first layer is closer to the pure 2d case . at the same density exchange frequencies in the first layer",
    "are 10 times lower than in the second layer where @xmath1he atom permutations are made easier through excursion in the third dimension .",
    "however the same general trends are observed :    * a low - density commensurate solid phase is stabilized by the graphite potential in case ( i ) and by the periodic potential of the first layer in case ( ii ) .",
    "its susceptibility has an antiferromagnetic character with a negative curie - weiss constant .",
    "both susceptibility and specific heat present anomalous deviations with respect to the usual asymptotic behavior at high temperature ( curie weiss law for the susceptibility and t@xmath72 behavior for the specific heat ) .",
    "these features are due to the frustrated nature of the system and can be quantitatively fit through the ring - exchange model@xcite . down to 10",
    "@xmath70k no long - range ordering has been detected , which seems to confirm the presence of a spin - liquid state .",
    "an ultra - low temperature specific - heat measurement@xcite and susceptibility measurements@xcite put a higher limit of 10 - 100  @xmath70k on a possible gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "hence solid @xmath1he films could be the first experimental realization of a gapless spin liquid .",
    "* at higher densities , an incommensurate solid phase is observed .",
    "the susceptibility has a positive curie weiss constant , but the unusual features of the specific heat indicate that we have a `` frustrated ferromagnetic '' phase with relatively larger three - spin exchange but significant competing four - particle exchange@xcite .",
    "the frustration is easily `` tunable '' in the sense that when the density is further increased , three - spin exchange dominates leading to a more conventional ferromagnet .",
    "some anomalies in the specific heat are present only in the commensurate phases .",
    "a very interesting interpretation has been recently proposed by h. fukuyama@xcite , in terms of `` ground - state vacancies '' surrounded by magnetic polarons .",
    "this exciting idea established a close link with strongly interacting almost - localized electron systems close to a mott - hubbard transition ( e.g the physics of cuprates ! ) .",
    "in the insulating phases of cuprates , the first experimental results in contradiction with a pure heisenberg model were the anomalously broad multi - magnon raman spectrum@xcite and the infrared optical absorption by phonon assisted multimagnon excitations@xcite in la@xmath2cuo@xmath73 .",
    "both results can be understood with the occurrence of four - spin exchange@xcite .",
    "however the key experiments which really invalidates the pure heisenberg model is the inelastic neutron study of the magnon spectrum near the brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "it is in agreement with the presence of ferromagnetic three - spin exchange terms @xmath74 as those appearing in the expansion of the one - band hubbard model ( eq .",
    "however , due to accidental cancellations occurring for the nel phase of the square lattice , the linear spin - wave spectrum is insensitive to the presence of four - spin exchange operators@xcite .",
    "an excellent way to probe directly the presence of four - spin terms is the study of spin - spin correlations in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "these correlation have been recently measured through diffuse magnetic scattering of polarized neutrons in la@xmath2cuo@xmath73 at @xmath75@xcite .",
    "the results are compared to predictions from high - temperature series expansions of the hamiltonian .",
    "they prove definitively the presence of four - spin interaction with a ratio @xmath76 of about 20% .",
    "the same cu - o plaquettes are present in copper based quasi-1d spin ladder materials sr@xmath77cu@xmath78o@xmath79 and la@xmath80ca@xmath81cu@xmath78o@xmath79 , with approximately the same cu - o bonds and distances as in la@xmath2cuo@xmath82 . the first neighbor pair exchanges along rungs and legs are expected to be roughly equal @xmath83 .",
    "in that case the theory predict a gap @xmath84 in the excitation spectrum .",
    "the experimental value of the gap is substantially lower : @xmath85@xcite . a relatively small four - spin exchange @xmath86 accounts for the decrease of the gap@xcite .",
    "this effect is related to the frustration due to four - spin exchange , which increases the density of low lying eigenstates .    _",
    "the concept of multi - particle exchange , pioneered by dirac at the beginning of the 20@xmath87 century , now appears as essential in the physics of strongly - correlated fermion systems which have raised considerable interest during the last decades . _",
