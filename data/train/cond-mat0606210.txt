    "since the pioneering works of delbrck @xcite , bartholomay @xcite and mcquarrie _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , kinetics of reacting systems with infinite - range interaction , containing a large but finite number of molecules or agents ( such as bacteria , cells , animals or even humans ) have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "while the change in time of the average number of particles in such systems may be describable by ( continuum ) rate equations , one often needs to know the probability of a non - typical behavior .",
    "this necessitates going beyond the rate equations , and a standard way of achieving this goal is provided by the _ master equation _ of a gain - loss type which directly deals with @xmath1 : the probability of simultaneously having @xmath2 particles of the first type , @xmath3 particles of the second type , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 particles of the @xmath6th type at time @xmath7 @xcite . though providing a complete description , the master equation is rarely solvable analytically , so various approximations are in use @xcite .",
    "probably the most widely used approximation is the fokker - planck equation which usually suffices when one is _ not _ interested in extreme statistics , such as extinction time @xcite .",
    "being interested in extreme statistics , we will exploit here a well - known mathematical formulation ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) which , though exactly equivalent to the master equation , deals instead with a generating function @xmath8 which encodes all the probabilities @xmath1 .",
    "the generating function is defined in the following way : @xmath9 whereas the probabilities @xmath1 are recovered by differentiation : @xmath10 this formulation transforms the master equation ( an infinite set of differential difference equations ) into a single linear partial differential equation for @xmath8 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a real linear differential operator which involves derivatives with respect to the auxiliary variables @xmath13 . the initial condition for this equation",
    "is supplied by eq .",
    "( [ genfunmany ] ) with the time - dependent probabilities replaced by their ( prescribed ) values at @xmath14 .",
    "when the rate constants are time - independent , the operator @xmath12 is independent of time .",
    "there is one universal _",
    "boundary _ condition in this formulation",
    ". indeed , as @xmath15 one immediately gets @xmath16 correspondingly , @xmath17 must vanish at @xmath18 .",

    "the generating function @xmath20 is @xmath21 the probabilities @xmath22 are @xmath23 the evolution equation for @xmath24 is @xmath25 and the universal boundary condition ( [ universalmanybc ] ) is @xmath26 the initial condition is @xmath27    we will be interested in the important class of problems where the operator @xmath12 is of",
    "the _ second _ order @xcite .",
    "the crux of our approach is that , for any time - independent second - order linear differential operator @xmath12 , one can expand @xmath20 in a complete set of properly constructed orthogonal spatial eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the linear _ ordinary _ differential equation for these eigenfunctions can be obtained , for any specific problem , by separation of variables . by a proper change of variables",
    "one can always eliminate the first derivative from this equation , and arrive at a spectral problem for a _ stationary _ schrdinger equation for a zero - energy particle in a potential @xmath28 which depends on a parameter @xmath29 coming from the separation of variables .",
    "this parameter , unknown _ a priori _ , represents the eigenvalue of this problem .",
    "this spectral formulation is exact , and it paves the way to a systematic computation of the probabilities @xmath30 , where @xmath31 can be significantly different from the  typical \" , or average number of particles . using the probabilities , one can accurately estimate a host of quantities of interest , for example , the average extinction time and the lifetime distribution .",
    "the present work is mainly concerned with one useful technique within the framework of the spectral formulation : the wkb approximation @xcite which yields semiclassical eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . using these , one can construct an approximate solution of the initial value problem for @xmath20 and , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ probformula ] ) , calculate @xmath30 for @xmath32 .    as eq .",
    "( [ geneqmany ] ) is readily interpretable as a ( non - hermitian ) time - dependent schrdinger equation with imaginary time , there were earlier quantum mechanical interpretations of rare event statistics in reacting systems , such as the doi - peliti formalism of second quantization @xcite .",
    "still another approach to this class of problems has been recently suggested by elgart and kamenev @xcite .",
    "instead of dealing with the creation and annihilation operators , as is customary in the second quantization approach , elgart and kamenev reformulated the time - dependent problem in semiclassical terms , employing two strong inequalities : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average number of particles in the system at time @xmath7 .",
    "they showed that classical dynamics corresponding to the hamiltonian of the problem provide a valuable information about the rare - event statistics , and that this approach is greatly superior to the more customary fokker - planck description .",
    "elgart and kamenev start with the ansatz @xmath36 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ generaleq ] ) .",
    "then , neglecting the @xmath37 term , they arrive at a hamilton - jacobi equation for @xmath38 which , for a time - independent @xmath12 , is solvable @xcite .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath20 and , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ probformula ] ) , the probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "elgart and kamenev illustrated this approach on several pedagogical examples which included various combinations of binary annihilation , branching , decay and creation of particles .",
    "as explained above , we suggest in this work a different type of semiclassical approximation for this non - hermitian quantum mechanics : a stationary wkb approximation based on an exact spectral formulation .",
    "we will show that the two semiclassical approximations complement each other , each of them being advantageous in some region of the parameter space .",
    "we will demonstrate our approach by a simple example of binary annihilation reaction @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the rate constant . in this case",
    "the master equation is @xmath41\\,,\\ ] ] while the evolution equation for @xmath20 takes the form @xmath42 this example is instructive for two reasons .",
    "first , it is one of the examples used by elgart and kamenev @xcite to illustrate their time - dependent semiclassical approach .",
    "second , and no less important , it is exactly solvable .",
    "@xcite used the exact solution to find the average number of particles and the variance versus time , when starting from a fixed even number of particles .",
    "we significantly extend the analytical solution in appendix and find the probabilities @xmath22 for all @xmath31 and @xmath7 , and their various asymptotics . using these findings",
    ", we also calculate the probability distribution of lifetimes of the particles in this system and the average extinction time .",
    "these exact results provide a benchmark for our wkb theory . in principle , the strong inequality @xmath32 is the only criterion required in this theory for _ all _ times .",
    "we observed , however , that in practice one also needs to require @xmath43 , in order to avoid loss of accuracy resulting from summation of many large terms of alternating sign .",
    "we will show that , in the region of @xmath43 , the stationary wkb formalism is much more accurate than the time - dependent formalism due to elgart and kamenev , while in the region of @xmath44 the time - dependent formalism ( which circumvents the summation of large terms of alternating sign ) is advantageous .",

    "section v presents a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "to complete the formulation of the problem for eq .",
    "( [ anndiffeq ] ) , we need two boundary conditions .",

    "this corresponds to a single particle , @xmath59 , which lives forever as there are no particles it can react with .",

    "we will proceed as if we were unaware of the exact solution , and find the spectrum of @xmath29 and the eigenfunctions in the wkb approximation .",
    "the crucial assumption of our semiclassical theory is that the main contribution to the probabilities @xmath30 with @xmath32 comes from the _ semiclassical _ region of spectrum of @xmath29 , where @xmath71 and the eigenfunctions have multiple zeros on the interval @xmath72 .",
    "we will verify this assumption _ a posteriori_. employing the strong inequality @xmath71 , we find by a standard calculation @xcite two independent ( even and odd ) wkb solutions of eq .",
