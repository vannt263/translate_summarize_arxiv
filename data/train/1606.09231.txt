    "unruh @xcite in 1981 suggested a theoretical method based on the fact that , considering the sound wave motion , a change of a subsonic runoff for supersonic flow forms an event horizon analogous to an event horizon of a gravitational black hole .",
    "since then , the study of analog models of gravity @xcite has become an important field to investigate the hawking radiation as well as to improve the theoretical understanding of quantum gravity . for such analog models",
    "there are many examples , so we highlight gravity wave  @xcite , water  @xcite , slow light  @xcite , optical fiber  @xcite and electromagnetic waveguide  @xcite . specially in fluid systems , the propagation of perturbations of the fluid has been analyzed in many analog models of acoustic black holes , such as the models of superfluid helium ii  @xcite , atomic bose - einstein condensates  @xcite and one - dimensional fermi degenerate noninteracting gas  @xcite that were elaborated to create a sonic black hole geometry in the laboratory .",
    "more specifically , in a quantum liquid the quasiparticles are bosons ( phonons ) in @xmath0he and bosons and fermions in @xmath1he which move in the background of effective gauge and/or gravity simulated by the dynamics of collective modes .",
    "these quasiparticles are analogs of elementary particles of low - energy effective quantum field theory .",
    "in particular , phonons propagating in the inhomogeneous liquid can be described by the effective lagrangian mimicing the dynamics of an scalar field in the curved spacetime given by the effective acoustic metric where the free quasiparticles move along geodesics . in superfluid @xmath1he -",
    "a , the effective quantum field theory contains chiral fermion quasiparticles where the collective bosonic modes interact with these ` elementary particles ' as gauge fields and gravity .",
    "these advances are important for a better insight into the understanding of quantum gravity .",
    "in addition , the study of a relativistic version of acoustic black holes was presented in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the acoustic black hole metrics obtained from a relativistic fluid in a noncommutative spacetime  @xcite and lorentz violating abelian higgs model  @xcite have been considered .",
    "the thermodynamics of acoustic black holes in two dimensions was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied acoustic black holes in the framework of neo - newtonian hydrodynamics and in @xcite the effect of neo - newtonian hydrodynamics on the superresonance phenomenon was analyzed .    in 1959 , aharonov and bohm showed that when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a region with the magnetic flux , despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes , experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , that is essentially the scattering of charged particles , has been used to address several issues in planar physics and it was experimentally confirmed by tonomura  @xcite  for a review see  @xcite .",
    "the effect can also be simulated in quantum field theory as for example by using a nonrelativistic field theory for bosonic particles which interact with a chern - simons field  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite was addressed the ab effect considering the noncommutative spacetime and in @xcite the effect was obtained due to violation of lorentz symmetry in quantum field theory .",
    "furthermore , several other analogs of the ab effect were found in gravitation  @xcite , fluid dynamics  @xcite , optics  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the background flow velocity @xmath2 plays the role of the electromagnetic potential @xmath3 , and the integrated vorticity in the core @xmath4 plays the role of the magnetic flux @xmath5 . thus , surface waves on water crossing an irrotational ( bathtub ) vortex experience an analog of the ab effect .",
    "also , the gravitational analog of the electromagnetic ab effect which is purely classical is related to the particles constrained to move in a region where the riemann curvature tensor vanishes . however , a gravitational effect arises from a region of nonzero curvature from which the particles are excluded .",
    "an interesting system was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that planar waves scattered by a draining bathtub vortex develops a modified ab effect that has a dependence on two dimensionless parameters related to the circulation and draining rates @xcite .",
    "it has been found an inherent asymmetry even in the low - frequency regime which leads to novel interference patterns .",
    "more recently in  @xcite , were extended the analysis made in  @xcite to a lorentz - violating and noncommutative background @xcite which allows to have persistence of phase shifts even if circulation and draining vanish .",
    "one of the theoretical methods of investigating the underlying structure of the spacetime is studying the solution of field equations for the fermion fields , besides the bosonic ones , in a curved geometry .",
    "the behavior of matter fields in the vicinity of black holes results in the better understanding of their properties .",
    "fermion fields were analyzed in a kerr black hole , in the near horizon limit , as well as in the case of reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite . in @xcite",
    "non - zero dirac fermion modes in the spacetime of black hole cosmic string system was considered .",
    "the authors studied the near - horizon behavior of fermion fields which results in superconductivity in the case of extremal charged dilaton black hole .",
    "although the effective sonic black hole spacetime is not the one fermion fields would observe , but it can be used as a toy model and a mathematical tool to study and as a result understand better the dynamics of the massive and massless fermion fields in a gravitational rotating black hole as well as a vortex background and shed light on the underlying physics . in the present study",
    "we consider the dynamics of a massive dirac spinor field in a curved spacetime and apply the acoustic black hole metric to obtain the differential cross section for scattered planar waves which leads to an analog ab effect . besides that , we compare the results with the massless scalar field case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we briefly introduce the acoustic black hole . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we compute the differential cross section due to the scattering of planar waves that leads to an analog ab effect . finally in sec .",

    "figures [ fig1]-[fig2 ] show the differential cross section for the massless boson and fermion for two cases @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 , choosing @xmath98 and also the special case where there is no draining , in the absence of the black hole .",
    "as can be seen , the result for the fermionic case tends to the bosonic one for small angles . besides that , the left graphs in the figs .",

    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] , as @xmath101\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as can be seen , in the limit @xmath99 , the scattering cross section is equal to @xmath102 for the fermion case which is only dependent on the circulation .",
    "we think this happens due to the fact that the fermionic field has an intrinsic angular momentum which interacts with the angular momentum of the black hole originating from the circulation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the differential cross section of a massive spinor field in the background of the acoustic black hole spacetime , as a toy model for the gravitational rotating black hole , using the partial wave approach .",
    "we have investigated the scattering of planar waves in a fermionic system by a background vortex as an analog for a rotating black hole .",
    "because of the form of the spinor field which has upper and lower components , we have calculated the phase shifts for these components separately and then averaged them .",
    "we have worked with three dimensionless parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 related to the circulation , fermion mass and draining , respectively .",
    "we have obtained the differential cross section at long wavelengths and discussed the limiting cases including small angles and also in the absence of the circulation .",
    "one could see that the dominant contribution in the small angle limit for the fermionic case is exactly the same as the bosonic one when the mass of the fermion is zero .",
    "this dominant contribution comes from the circulation term .",
    "therefore , for small angles the contribution of the circulation is more important than the draing one .",
    "furthermore , considering the cross section in the absence of the circulation shows that the result is the same for the bosonic and fermionic cases when the fermion is massless . in this limit ,",
    "the result is independent of the angle @xmath84 .",
    "the reason for that is in the absence of the circulation the only term that contributes in the long wavelength regime to the differential cross section is a polar symmetric term .",
    "finally , we have shown that in contrast with the bosonic case in the limit @xmath99 , considering @xmath100 , the scattering cross section goes to a nonzero constant equal to @xmath102 for the fermion case which is only dependent on the circulation .",
    "the similar scattering behavior for both boson and fermion for small angles seems to be in accord with both being scattered between the horizon and the ergosphere radius . at this regime",
    "both enjoys the penrose effect of gaining energy after the scattering ( the superresonance effect ) . as figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] ( right panel ) show , this indeed agrees with the increasing of the differential cross section as the frequency increases .",
    "this precisely happens as long as the frequency belongs the interval @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the azimuthal mode number and @xmath108 is the angular velocity of the black hole @xcite . on the other hand , for large angles ,",
    "both particles tend to be scattered outside the ergoregion and in turn they almost keep the scattering constant as figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] ( left panel ) show .",
    "this is particularly more accurate for fermions .",
    "a detailed analysis of the superresonance effect for fermion fields should be addressed elsewhere . besides that",
    ", in a future work , we plan to study a more realistic model considering the dynamics of the fermionic fields interacting with a black hole , gravitational or an analog in a condensed matter system .",
