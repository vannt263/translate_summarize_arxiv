    "but such interactions should normally exist , and are even essential when estimating the relic density of dark matter particles having a sizeable mass , which should annihilate at a sufficient rate ( otherwise their relic abundance would be too large ) .",
    "the importance of such annihilations is well - known , for example , in the familiar case of `` weakly - interacting massive particles '' , the most favored being the neutralino , whose stability results from the @xmath1-parity of supersymmetric theories . but even if such interactions are considered as `` weak '' , is it really legitimate to disregard them when discussing the theory of structure formation ?",
    "the possible rle of dark matter interactions is precisely what we would like to study , in a general way , irrespectively of the specific dark matter candidate one may have in mind .",
    "indeed dark matter properties should be such that the primordial fluctuations corresponding to objects of masses larger than about @xmath2 ( i.e. to sizes @xmath3 100 kiloparsecs ) should not be erased .",
    "the damping of the primordial fluctuations may be due to the familiar free - streaming of dark matter particles ; but also , prior to this free - streaming , to _ collisional damping _ effects resulting from dark matter interactions , when these are explicitly taken into account .",
    "up to which point is it legitimate to consider dark matter particles as effectively free , and from which values of the cross - sections and interaction rates should dark matter interactions start playing a significant rle ?      the free - streaming scale associated with dark matter particles is simply fixed by the distance  as evaluated today",

    "the physical interpretation of this formula will be explained shortly .    .2truecm",
    "however , in a number of situations it is essential to take into account that dark matter particles may remain in equilibrium with particles belonging to other species ( generically denoted by an index @xmath10 ) , up to a decoupling time @xmath11  it is then possible to view the dark matter particles as forming , together with the particles of these other species , a single ( multicomponent ) fluid .",

    "we shall then obtain constraints on the possible dark matter candidates which may be allowed , by demanding that both the collisional damping and the free - streaming scales be smaller than a scale @xmath28 , defined as the scale associated with the smallest objects known to be of primordial origin .",

    "the accumulated collisional damping scale , on the other hand , turns out , in the relevant cases , to be dominated by the contribution of the late epochs , for which the time @xmath37 gets close to the decoupling time of dark matter .",
    "the interaction rate of a dark matter particle @xmath38 then gets close to the expansion rate of the universe @xmath39 , taken at the decoupling time of dark matter . the self - damping scale given by eq.([lsd ] ) then verifies , approximately , [ lsd2 ]   l _    .",

    ".2truecm there is , however , one possible exception to this statement ( [ ineq ] ) : if dark matter were sufficiently strongly interacting so as to remain coupled until the time of the gravitational collapse , there would be _ no free - streaming at all _ of dark matter particles ! in this rather extreme case , for which dark matter would remain collisional until ( and after ) collapse , the collisional damping scale is the only one to be considered .",

    ".2truecm this too nave conclusion , however , should be corrected , because the evaluation of the free - streaming scale is itself modified , in the presence of interactions . as a result even by considering _ free - streaming effects only _",
    ", one may get , in the case of dark matter particles which decouple after becoming non - relativistic ( cf . regions ii and iii to be discussed later ) , _ stronger constraints _ on the dark matter particle mass by considering its interactions . and this , _ despite the fact that dark matter particles enter later in the free - streaming regime _ !    .2truecm    furthermore , returning to self - damping effects it would be incorrect to disregard them as irrelevant , even if strictly - speaking they do not bring in any additional constraint as compared to free - streaming . because collisional damping effects are at work _ before free - streaming _",

    "to go further and specify the explicit expressions of the various damping lengths and subsequent constraints of the characteristics of dark matter particles , we need to know 1 ) whether dark matter particles are still relativistic or not at the time of their decoupling ;  and 2 ) whether their non relativistic transition and their decoupling transition occur while the universe is still radiation - dominated ( with @xmath43 ) , or already matter - dominated ( with @xmath44 .    .2truecm",
    "this leads us to introduce a general classification of the dark matter particle candidates , according to these criteria ",

    "furthermore , the explicit expression of the free - streaming scale ( [ lfs ] ) is itself modified , when the effects of dark matter interactions are taken into account .",
    "indeed the velocity of a non - relativistic dark matter particle of mass @xmath47 decreases more slowly with time if it is interacting ( @xmath48 ) than if it propagates freely ( @xmath49 ) .    .17truecm",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the free - streaming scale , for particles in regions ii and iii ( as compared to region i ) . indeed from the time @xmath50 such dark matter particles start propagating freely ( after getting non - relativistic at @xmath51 ) , they actually do so with a higher velocity than if they were propagating freely since the time @xmath52 of their non - relativistic transition .",

    "the free - streaming scale of a dark matter particle of a given mass @xmath54 turns out to be larger in regions ii or iii ( excluding iii ) than in region i , despite the fact that in these regions the particle remains longer in the collisional regime !    .19truecm    in region",

    "ev we then get @xmath81 kpc ( 10 kev/@xmath82 as a rough order of magnitude estimate .",
    ".2truecm    particles heavier than about @xmath83 10 kev , approximately , would then lead to acceptable values of the free - streaming scale less than about 100 kpc . in the lower part of the allowed mass range , this corresponds to `` warm dark matter '' scenarios , as when interactions were disregarded ; and to `` cold dark matter '' , in the case of heavier particles .    .2truecm",
    "we recover at this stage , in the lower part of region i , the usual notions of cold , warm and hot dark matter , as they may be classified according to the dark matter particle mass or to the corresponding value of the free - streaming scale ( [ lfs ] ) or ( [ lfs3 ] ) .",
    "`` hot dark matter '' ( made of , e.g. , light massive neutrinos , ... ) is excluded due to excessively large free - streaming scales , `` warm dark matter '' corresponding to free - streaming scales nearly as large as the allowed value taken of about @xmath84 100 kpc , and `` cold dark matter '' to significantly smaller values of this scale .    .2truecm",
    "we are now able to extend these notions by taking into account , systematically , the effects of dark matter interactions , which may both 1 ) enhance the value of the free - streaming scale and 2 ) provide physically - interesting collisional damping effects , either from self - damping or from induced - damping .",
    "the boundary between region i and region ii , which obeys the equation @xmath85 , indicates the level at which dark matter interactions start modifying significantly the damping of the primordial dark matter fluctuations .",
    "a dark matter particle with a mass of @xmath86 mev for example ( assuming appropriate dilution or annihilations to have occurred , for a suitable relic abundance ) , which would normally have been considered as leading to relatively small damping compared to the allowed scale of 100 kpc , may actually become a warm dark matter candidate , as a result of the enhancement of the free - streaming scale in region ii , by a factor @xmath53 .",
    ".2truecm    in region iii the enhancement factor of the free - streaming scale , @xmath87 ,  may be as large as @xmath88 in the case of a @xmath83 10 mev particle , which may then acquire a just - acceptable damping length of @xmath89 kpc ( as compared to @xmath90 100 pc for a particle of the same mass , in region i , according to equation ( [ lfs3 ] ) ) .    .2truecm    beyond that",
    ", we can propose a further redefinition of the notions of cold , warm and hot dark matter by considering not only the free - streaming scale alone ( even modified by the effects of the interactions ) , but the whole damping scale obtained by combining the collisional ( self - damping plus induced damping ) and free - streaming scales . in this way we take into account the various possible dark matter interactions , both with itself and with other particle species such as photons and neutrinos .",
    "cdm will then correspond to values of the damping scales significantly smaller than @xmath91 , and wdm to values nearly as large as the allowed value .    .18truecm    before turning to induced - damping effects , for which the damping of dark matter fluctuations is due to the transport of energy and momentum by other particle species , we refer to fig . 1 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this plane dark matter interaction rate ( @xmath92 ) at decoupling versus dark matter particle mass @xmath93 ( times @xmath94 ) , we represent the regions excluded by both self - damping and free - streaming effects .",
    "these excluded regions may be viewed as corresponding to extensions of `` hot dark matter '' scenarios to the new cases for which _ collisional damping _ as well as _ interaction - enhanced free - streaming effects _ are taken into account .",
    "the regions relatively close to the excluded ones , for which the damping scale is not much lower than the scale @xmath28 of the smallest primordial objects , may be considered as corresponding to extensions of `` warm dark matter '' scenarios .",
    "-.1truecm    one should also consider the additional damping effects induced by other particle species to which dark matter may be coupled , such as the photons and the neutrinos .",
    "the magnitude of these effects is given by the induced - damping scale associated with a species @xmath26 , as expressed by eq.([lid ] ) , the integral over time running until the decoupling time of dark matter from this species @xmath26 .",
    ".2truecm photons and neutrinos may be particularly relevant , not only because they are relativistic ( @xmath95 ) , but also because they could interact long enough with dark matter , if their interaction cross - sections with dark matter particles turned out to be sufficiently large .",
    "the corresponding induced - damping scales , given by [ lid3 ] l _ ^2   ^t _  , for photons , and similarly for neutrinos , should both be smaller than the length @xmath96 , here taken to be @xmath97 100 kpc .  in particular , the constraint @xmath98 @xmath99 kpc leads us to upper limits on the interaction rates of dark matter particles with photons at the corresponding decoupling time , and therefore to _ upper limits _ on the dark - matter / photon interaction cross - sections .",
    "( the more dark matter particles interact with those of a given species , the longer the latter can influence their properties , and the larger is the resulting contribution to the induced - damping length of the primordial dark matter fluctuations . ) the moment at which the photons cease to communicate their damping to the dark matter fluid should occur before the recombination epoch in order to avoid prohibitive damping effects .",
    "the damping induced by neutrinos is normally expected to be very small , excepted in special situations for which dark matter would decouple from neutrinos at a temperature @xmath100 mev . in that case `` freely - propagating neutrinos '' could influence the properties of dark matter and induce a non - negligible `` collisional damping '' of its primordial fluctuations .",
