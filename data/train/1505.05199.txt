    "normal diffusion or subdiffusion in a membrane system widely occurs in biology and engineering sciences ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider subdiffusion in a one dimensional system with a thin membrane .",
    "the most commonly used definition of subdiffusion is that this process is the random walk of particles in which @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mean square displacement of a particle , @xmath2 is a subdiffusion parameter ( subdiffusion exponent ) , @xmath3 is a subdiffusion coefficient , and @xmath4 is the gamma function .",
    "subdiffusion occurs in media in which the particles movement is strongly hindered due to the complex internal structure of the medium , such as , for example , in porous media or gels @xcite .",
    "the subdiffusion is often described by the following subdiffusion equation with the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional time derivative @xcite @xmath5 the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivative is defined as being valid for @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is a natural number which fulfils @xmath8 ) @xmath9 there arise a problem how to set boundary conditions at a thin membrane ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    the structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq18b ] ) shows that the presence of the fractional derivative in a model can be interpreted as dealing with a ` long  memory ' process . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the process is usually identified as normal diffusion , which is considered as the markov process .",
    "normal diffusion can be interpreted as a particle s random walk in which the mean square displacement of a single jump length and the mean frequency of jumps are both finite .",
    "however , there are processes in which the anomalously long waiting time for a particle to take its next step is entangled with the anomalously large length of jumps in a special way that provides @xmath10 @xcite . as concluded in @xcite in order to define subdiffusion , relation ( [ eq0a ] ) should be supplemented by an appropriate stochastic interpretation of the random walk process .",
    "such a simple interpretation is given within the _ continuous time random walk _",
    "( ctrw ) model where the random walk is described by the probability density @xmath11 of a single jump length @xmath12 and a probability density @xmath13 of time @xmath14 , which is needed for the particle to take its next step .",
    "it is assumed that for normal diffusion both distributions have finite moments of all natural orders whereas for subdiffusion the mean value of @xmath13 is infinite and the moments of @xmath11 are finite . in this paper",
    "we base our consideration on the random walk model on a lattice for which @xmath15 ( at the vicinity of the membrane the definition of @xmath11 is slightly different ) , @xmath16 is the distance between discrete sites ; in this paper @xmath17 denotes both the kronecker symbol ( for a discrete space variable ) or the delta ",
    "dirac function ( for a continuous space variable ) .",
    "the kind of diffusion process is defined here by the function @xmath13 .",
    "obtaining the results for a system with a discrete spatial variable , we pass into a continuous system in the limit @xmath18 , using the formulas presented in this paper .    in paper @xcite , subdiffusion in a system with a thin stopping membrane was considered ; the membrane was assumed to be partially permeable with respect to both its sides , @xmath19 .",
    "the green s functions , obtained for this case , generate the boundary condition at the membrane which contains the term with the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivative ; this term , which is present even when normal diffusion occurs , vanishes over sufficiently long time .",
    "this boundary condition can be interpreted as the particle s passing through the thin membrane being a ` long memory ' process . in this paper",
    "we extend the consideration to the case of a reflecting membrane , subdiffusion in a system with a one  sidedly fully permeable membrane is also studied within the models of reflecting or stopping membranes .",
    "there are three main aims of this paper .",
    "firstly , we make a comparison between the green s functions obtained for the model in which the particle can be reflected from the membrane and the model in which the particle can be stopped by the membrane .",
    "we find the conditions under which these functions are not equivalent to each other .",
    "secondly , we examine the boundary conditions at the thin membrane and check when these conditions do not contain ` long memory ' terms . at this point",
    "we consider in detail the case of a one  sidedly fully permeable membrane .",
    "thirdly , we find the generalized method of images which provides the green s functions for the membrane system derived in this paper within the ctrw model .",
    "next , using the generalized method of images , we obtain the green s functions for a system with a thin membrane , in which the special case of ` slow subdiffusion ' occurs . `",
    "slow subdiffusion ' is understood here as a random walk for which all fractional moments of @xmath13 are infinite , @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we present the general assumptions of the method . as an example , the green s function for a homogeneous system without a membrane is derived . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we determine the green s functions for a system with a membrane which reflects particles with some probability . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we show the green s functions for a system in which particles can be stopped by the membrane ; the green s functions for a system with membrane which is partially permeable with respect to both its sides are taken from paper @xcite ; the new result is obtained for the case of a one  sidedly fully permeable membrane .",
    "the generalized method of images is presented in section [ sec5 ] . as an example of the usefulness of this method",
    ", we find the green s function for ` slow ",
    "subdiffusion ' in a system with a thin membrane . a comparison of the green s functions obtained from the models presented in the sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] and a discussion of the new results obtained in this paper are presented in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we focus our attention on deriving the probability density ( green s function ) @xmath22 of finding a particle at point @xmath23 after time @xmath24 under the condition that at the initial moment @xmath25 , the particle was at point @xmath26 ( here we consider a particle s random walk in a one  dimensional system ) . to find this function for a system with a thin membrane we use a particle s random walk model in a system",
    "in which the time @xmath27 and spatial variable @xmath28 are discrete ; after this , we pass from discrete to continuous variables .    in a system with discrete variables , the particle s random walk is described by a difference equation whose general form reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probability that a particle jumps from site @xmath31 directly to site @xmath28@xmath32 is the probability of finding a particle at site @xmath28 after step @xmath27 and @xmath33 is the initial position of the particle @xmath34 for normal diffusion and subdiffusion long jumps occur with a low probability , thus we assume that the particle can only jump to its adjacent position .",
    "it is not allowed to remain in the current occupied position in the particle after the time at which the jump should be executed unless the particle is stopped by the membrane .",
    "such a model is useful in modeling normal or anomalous diffusion processes in a system with a partially permeable thin membrane .",
    "the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ eq0b ] ) , applied to describe a random walk in a membrane system in which the homogeneity of the system is impaired at a single point , is solvable by means of the generating function method @xcite . after solving these equations ( more precisely , after determining the generating function for the equations ) one can make the transition from discrete to continuous variables .",
    "the transition from discrete to continuous time is performed as in the ctrw method while passing from a discrete to continuous space variable is performed using the formulas presented in this paper .",
    "the reason for the introduction of such formulas is the specific behavior of the particles in the vicinity of the partially permeable membrane .    in @xcite",
    "the random walk in a homogeneous system was considered assuming @xmath35 the considerations were also extended to the case of normal diffusion in a system with a fully reflecting or fully absorbing membrane . in these systems , the ` parity rule ' , meaning that the number of steps @xmath27 and the distance traveled by a particle @xmath36 , are both even numbers or both odd numbers , is fulfilled . for the system with a fully reflecting or fully absorbing membrane the green s functions",
    "were obtained using symmetry arguments .",
    "it was shown @xcite that if the wall were removed , for each particle s trajectory which passes the line representing the position of the wall , there exists a symmetrical trajectory with respect to the wall , which is solely located in the half  space bounded by the wall , in which the particle started its random walk . in this way it was shown",
    "that the green s functions for these systems is the sum ( for the system with a fully reflecting wall ) or difference ( for the system with a fully absorbing wall ) of the green s functions obtained for the homogeneous system without the wall , and the initial points @xmath26 of these functions are located symmetrically with respect to the wall .",
    "the green s function can be interpreted as a normalized concentration profile of particles initially located at the initial point , which means the concentration of @xmath37 particles , divided by @xmath37 , @xmath38 . by differently describing the method of images ,",
    "the idea of this method is that the wall is replaced by the additional particles source located in such a way that the particles concentration generated by the particles source located at @xmath33 and by the additional particles source both fulfil the appropriate boundary condition at the wall : the vanishing of the particles flux at the reflecting wall and the vanishing of the particles concentration at the absorbing wall .",
    "the method of images appears to be useful tool in deriving green s function for a system containing two walls .",
    "the situation is different when a thin partially permeable membrane is located in the system .",
    "the presence of the membrane can be taken into account in the model in two different ways which depend on assumptions about how a particle is stopped by the membrane . assuming that a thin membrane is located between the @xmath37 and the @xmath39 site , there are two possibilities concerning the influence of the membrane on a particle s movement . in the first model , the particle can be ` reflected ' by the membrane , which means that after the jump the particle always changes position .",
    "if the particle s attempt to pass through the membrane from the @xmath37 to the @xmath39 site fails with probability @xmath40 , the particle is reflected by the membrane from the @xmath37 to the @xmath41 site ; if the particle tries to jump through the membrane from the @xmath39 to the @xmath37 site and this attempt fails with probability @xmath42 , then the particle is reflected from the @xmath39 to the @xmath43 site . in this case",
    "we obtain ( see fig .",

    "@xmath44    for this model the ` parity rule ' is satisfied .    for the model in which the particle can be stopped by the membrane , the particle remains in its position after the ` jump ' when the passing through the membrane has failed with probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath42 . in this case",

    "[ fig3].,height=302 ]    figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are merely on illustration of the green s functions but show some general regularities of subdiffusion in a membrane system .",
    "membrane permeability property is less manifest in a system in which slow subdiffusion occurs .",
    "this is due to the fact that when a particle tries to jump through a thin membrane , the probability of a particle being stopped by the membrane is the same as for the different processes occurring in the membrane system but a subsequent attempt at a jump is expected to be much later in the system in which slow subdiffusion occurs .",
    "so , the probability of a particle s passing through the membrane over a certain time interval is less for this process compared to the ` standard ' subdiffusion process .",
    "the qualitative comparison of the changes of the green s functions for different orders of the time variable is also interested .",
    "for ` slow subdiffusion ' the changes are relatively small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , whereas for ` standard ' subdiffusion the scale of the changes is much higher ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in this study we consider subdiffusion in two systems with a thin membrane .",
    "the differences between the systems are related to the assumption concerning the process of the reflecting or stopping of a particle by the membrane when an attempt to pass the particle through the membrane fails . in the first model",
    ", the particle can be reflected off by the membrane with a certain probability , the second model assumes that the particle can be stopped , with a certain probability , at the membrane .",
    "these assumptions can be associated with the following physical interpretation .",
    "if there is a slight repulsive force , generated by the membrane and acting on the particle , then the model of the reflecting membrane can be used . otherwise , including the case in which a small attraction of the particle exerted by the membrane is assumed , the stopping membrane model can be used to describe subdiffusion in a membrane system .",
    "the differences between the models are manifested in two cases :    1 .",
    "the probability of finding a particle at the surface of the membrane is different for both models when the membrane is partially permeable with respect to both its sides , i.e. when @xmath94 .",
    "the green s functions are discontinuous at the membrane surface for the model with a reflecting membrane ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq47 ] ) ) and continuous for the model with a stopping membrane .",
    "2 .   for the system",
    "in which the membrane is fully one  sidedly permeable , the green s functions for both models take a form which can be expressed by the function obtained within the generalized method of images ( [ eq71])([eq73 ] ) if the ` gradient source function ' @xmath207 is omitted .",
    "however , the green s functions obtained for the model with a reflecting membrane and the ones obtained for the model with a stopping membrane are not equivalent to each other .",
    "the reason being that if is not possible to find the relation between the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath137 ( for @xmath95 ) in such a way that eqs .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) and ( [ eq53 ] ) coincide with eqs .",
    "( [ eq69a ] ) and ( [ eq69b ] ) , respectively .",
    "a similar remark can be made for the case @xmath96 .",
    "for the case @xmath94 , the green s function for both models , eqs . (",
    "[ eq41 ] ) and ( [ eq45 ] ) for the model with a reflecting membrane and eqs .",
    "( [ eq67a ] ) and ( [ eq67b ] ) for the model with a stopping membrane , coincide with each other , respectively , in region @xmath208 if @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "since the membrane permeability coefficients are expected to be determined from experimental data when the model is used to describe subdiffusion in a real membrane system , it does not matter which of the models will be used in the modelling unless the probability of finding diffusing particles at the membrane surfaces is not considered .    to study the subdiffusion in a membrane system we use the model with a discrete time and space variable , next we transform the green s functions to continuous variables by means of the formulas presented in this paper .",
    "such a model seems to be oversimplified .",
    "however , for the homogeneous system without a membrane , it provides results which can be derived by means of more ` realistic ' models of subdiffusion .",
    "thus , we assume that the model used in this paper provides the green s functions which are useful in the modelling of subdiffusion in a system with a thin membrane .",
    "the method of images appears to be useful tool for determining the green s functions in a membrane system for a various model of subdiffusion for which the waiting time probability density is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq75 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that the generalized method of images allows us to obtain the green s function for the membrane system for a ` slow subdiffusion ' process .",
    "we hypothesize that the generalized method of images , presented in this paper , is applicable to other subdiffusion models .",
    "the considerations presented in this paper concern the case of @xmath156 . in general , the coefficient @xmath98 can be defined as a coefficient which controls the membrane permeability when a particle tries to pass through the membrane from a region of the initial particle s location to the opposite region , and @xmath99 is a membrane permeability coefficient when the particle moves in the opposite direction . in @xcite it was shown that for the case of @xmath94 the green s function for the model with a stopping membrane , eqs .",
    "( [ eq67a ] ) and ( [ eq67b ] ) , fulfil the following boundary condition at the membrane @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "this boundary condition is complemented by the condition of flux continuity at the membrane .",
    "the considerations presented in this paper show that boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ eq79 ] ) is fulfilled by the green s functions at the reflecting membrane for @xmath94 if we assume @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "the second term in the right - hand side of eq . ( [ eq79 ] ) , which vanishes over a sufficiently long time ( see the discussion presented in @xcite ) , represents the ` additional ' memory effect created by the membrane ( despite the fact that subdiffusion is a long  memory process itself ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for the case of @xmath95 or @xmath96 , the green s functions take the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq71])([eq73 ] ) with @xmath173 for both models .",
    "it is easy to see that these functions fulfil the boundary condition ( [ eq79 ] ) in which @xmath216 .",
    "thus , the ` additional memory effect ' is not created by the one  sidedly fully permeable membrane .    for the case of @xmath217",
    ", the functions and boundary conditions can be obtained from the functions presented in this paper when , due to symmetry arguments , the following conversion is made : @xmath218 , @xmath219 ( or @xmath220 , @xmath221 ) , @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
