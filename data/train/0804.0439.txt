    "the short kelvin - helmholtz timescales of massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) allow these objects to begin emitting ionizing photons and to excite nearby material while still embedded in their natal clouds @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest observable manifestations of newly formed ob stars is the ultracompact hii ( uchii ) region .",
    "these embedded hii regions are initially small ( @xmath2 ) and dense ( @xmath3 ) and have a typical emission measure ( em ) @xmath4 10@xmath5  pc  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "as hii regions evolve their sizes increase , but they are still considered to be uchii regions as long as their emission measures ( or surface brightnesses ) remain high .    since most stars with m",
    "@xmath7 8  m@xmath8 should form uchii regions shortly after their birth , studies of uchii regions can help us learn about physical conditions in high - mass star forming regions and the evolution of the physical conditions as the massive stars turn on . a large percentage , @xmath7 50@xmath9 , of uchii regions have cometary , core - halo or irregular morphologies @xcite , arguing against the classical expanding sphere model of hii regions @xcite . in addition , statistical arguments based on the galactic population of uchii regions lead to estimates of the lifetime of these regions that are much longer than expected from the expanding sphere model @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed for uchii region formation ( see the review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with solving the lifetime problem a major goal .",
    "however , the age of an individual uchii region is hard to determine through observations .",
    "a number of theoretical models have been geared toward explaining both these long apparent lifetimes and the observed morphologies of uchii regions @xcite .",
    "observations of the morphology and gas kinematics of uchii regions can help us to constrain models for the structure and evolution of the regions much more definitively than observations of the morphology alone .",
    "the morphological type is not a unique indicator of the uchii region physics because many models can produce similar morphologies @xcite . while it is difficult to choose between different models based on the morphologies of hii regions , their kinematic signatures are very distinct . to understand the structure and evolution of the regions around the youngest massive stars , it is therefore necessary to observe gas kinematics inside uchii regions with the highest spectral and spatial resolution .",
    "the large extinction associated with molecular clouds around uchii regions , however , prevents direct observation at optical wavelengths and even at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus , observations at longer wavelengths become crucial to uchii region studies .",
    "radio interferometric observations can provide data with high angular and spectral resolution . at high enough frequencies , where non - lte effects become less important",
    ", hydrogen radio recombination line ( rrl ) emission has the same dependence on the electron density as thermal free - free radio continuum emission , and the emissivities of these lines are well known .",
    "rrl observations can provide information on gas density and kinematics , and , to a limited degree , on gas temperature",
    ". however , thermal broadening of hydrogen rrls due to the low mass of hydrogen atoms degrades the spectral resolution of radio spectroscopy .",
    "the thermal line width of the rrls ( or any hydrogen recombination lines like br@xmath10 and br@xmath11 , for that matter ) in an ionized region ( t@xmath1210@xmath13  k ) is @xmath14 20  km  s@xmath1 , comparable to the velocities of bulk flows in many sources . furthermore , the incomplete uv sampling of radio interferometric survey can both overemphasize compact structures and , more generally limit the spatial dynamic range of the observations .",
    "mid - ir fine structure line observations offer an alternative to radio and ir recombination line observations .",
    "fine structure lines have small thermal line widths because they are emitted by heavy elements .",
    "the importance of this feature of the fine structure lines has been illustrated previously by high spectral resolution maps of [ ne  ii ] emission in mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02 which show single lines or multiple components of lines with widths significantly smaller than the thermal widths of the hydrogen recombination lines @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the broad , largely gaussian hydrogen recombination lines are , in fact , superpositions of several much narrower kinematic components ( see especially fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , although the emitting species are several orders of magnitude less abundant than hydrogen , the fine structure lines are brighter than recombination lines because collisional excitation cross - sections are much larger than the relevant recombination cross - sections .",
    "typical electron densities over all compact and most ultracompact h  ii regions are lower than the critical density of the [ ne  ii ] 12.8  @xmath0 m transition ( @xmath15 ) , so this line shares the property of the recombination lines of having a line strength proportional to emission measure .",
    "we should mention that turbulence can also have significant effects on line widths .",
    "moreover , turbulence affects both rrl and fine structure line observations and prevents detections of velocity variations ( due to gas bulk motions ) with scales smaller than the intrinsic line width combining thermal and turbulent effects along any line of sight direction .",
    "our previous [ ne  ii ] line observations of a few uchii regions have demonstrated the effectiveness of using high spectral and spatial resolution maps of fine structure lines to study such regions @xcite . in these studies",
    ", we demonstrated that the kinematic patterns in the ionized gas in mon r2 and g29.96 - 0.02 are consistent with tangential flows along the surfaces of thin , more - or - less parabolic shells .",
    "the goal of the current paper is to use [ ne  ii ] mapping as a tool to examine a larger sample of compact and ultracompact hii regions with a range of shapes and sizes in order to look for a common thread in the kinematics that might lead to a better understanding of the physics and evolution of these sources .",
    "we present scan - mapped spectroscopic observations of fifteen galactic compact and ultracompact hii regions .",

    "for each object , a north - south oriented slit was used to scan the object from west to east .",
    "we chose the step size along the scans so that there were at least two steps per slit width and chose the scan lengths to cover the emission seen in radio continuum maps available in the literature . before each scan , we offset the telescope to the west several arcseconds beyond the edge of the maps shown in the figures .",
    "several extra steps were taken at the beginning and the end of each scan in order to measure the sky background .",
    "the lengths of the scans and the initial offsets were adjusted after examining a preliminary scan with our quick - look program @xcite .",
    "we made multiple overlapping scans , offset north - south , to cover the sources .",
    "texes takes ambient temperature blackbody and sky flats at the beginning of each scan for flux calibration .",
    "we use a custom fortran reduction program @xcite to correct optical distortions , flat field , remove cosmic ray spikes , and fix bad pixels .",
    "the same program also does wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "we use atmospheric lines for wavelength calibration , with wavelengths obtained from hitran @xcite .",
    "we use an idl script to subtract sky background and combine multiple scans . the sky emission at each slit position is linearly interpolated from the sky frames at the beginning and the end of each scan .",
    "sometimes , we start scans too late or end scans too early .",
    "extended line emission is present in our sky frames and is subtracted off from other frames .",
    "this will result in an underestimate of line flux from targets .",
    "multiple scans are cross - correlated , shifted and added to create the datacubes .",
    "normally , no shift is needed along the spectral direction .",

    "finally , we resample the datacubes so that each pixel has a size of @xmath17 on the sky .",
    "the coordinates of the resulting continuum maps and [ ne  ii ] line maps are relative to the peak positions in the integrated [ ne  ii ] line maps .",
    "when radio continuum maps are available , they are cross - correlated with the [ ne  ii ] maps so that both maps can be plotted on the same scale .",

    "the ionized region is considered as an archetype of the uchii regions caused by bow shocks @xcite , although some past observations of the gas velocities along the symmetry axis of this source argue against this interpretation , implying that the source is a blister flow @xcite or a blister flow modified by a stellar wind @xcite .",
    "we presented [ ne  ii ] line mapping observations and compared gas kinematics in the region with a bow shock model in @xcite .",
    "we include here a summary of the model and results for g29.96 from the earlier paper as a template for understanding the kinematics of some of the other sources in the sample .",
    "the bow shock model predicts that an approximately paraboloidal shell of swept - up material will form in front of a star moving supersonically inside a molecular cloud .",
    "the shell is supported by the ram pressure of the stellar wind and the ambient medium .",
    "swept - up material , including ionized and neutral gas , is forced to flow along the surface of the shell . with different viewing angles for the shell ,",
    "the model can reproduce many of the observed features in ionic line observations of g29.96 as well as several other uchii regions in our sample , including morphologies and the distinctive shapes that parabolic flows have in position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams .",
    "figure  [ g2996mapneii ] shows a 2  cm radio continuum map from @xcite and our spectrally integrated [ ne  ii ] line map of g29.96 .",
    "the two maps closely resemble each other , indicating that most of the [ ne  ii ] emission arises from gas with n@xmath20n@xmath21 and that the extinction to the gas is either rather uniform or small at 12.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "in fact , @xcite observed that the electron density in the region is sub - critical ( n@xmath22@xmath4680 @xmath23 - 5.7@xmath1910@xmath13 @xmath23 ) and @xcite reported low infrared extinction ( a@xmath24@xmath141.6 ) toward the region .",

    "these channel maps show a morphology change from a thin crescent in the most blue - shifted channels to a fan - like region in red - shifted channels .",
    "figures  [ g2996pv1 ] and [ g2996pv2 ] show position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams of several representative cross cuts made through the observed and model data cubes . the observations and the model display similar p - v structures ( as shown in our previous paper , a characteristic `` @xmath25 '' shape for cuts perpendicular to the nebular symmetry axis and a `` 7 '' shape for cuts parallel to the axis ) .",
    "similar changes in structure from cut to cut can also be seen .",
    "the similarities in line emission morphology and gas kinematics between the observations and the model indicate that the ionized gas in g29.96 flows along a thin shell at @xmath26  km  s@xmath1 , as it would if it were produced by a bow shock .",
    "we use these distinctive patterns in the p - v diagrams as indicators of the presence of surface flows in other sources where we have not carried out detailed model fits",
    ". however , one clear discrepancy between the bow shock model that gives the correct shape to the contours in the model p - v diagrams in figures  [ g2996pv1 ] and [ g2996pv2 ] and the observed sources is the @xmath415  km  s@xmath1 difference between the observed and modeled velocity of the ambient neutral material .",

    "( figure  [ g4545map ] ) , the kinematic pattern is confusing , and the most prominent feature in [ ne  ii ] is not apparent in the radio continuum .",
    "g61.48 ( figure  [ g6148mapneii ] ) is the source where the [ ne  ii ] morphology least resembles the distribution of the radio continuum emission .",
    "the [ ne  ii ] emission we see may therefore not be sampling the bulk of the gas , but the dominance of red - shifted gas in the rrl observations @xcite is consistent with the conclusion from the [ ne  ii]-radio continuum morphology difference , namely that the source is on the back side of the molecular cloud and the ionized material is flowing away from the neutral core .",
    "the kinematic types that we have assigned to observed sources are given in table  [ kintypes ] .",
    "examination of this list shows that none of the observed sources fits into category a or b , the classical expanding shell and sphere models of hii regions .",
    "none has a ring - like p - v diagram of an expanding shell , and the sources with broad lines are either too small for their morphologies to be apparent or have confused morphologies .",
    "in addition , none of the sources fits into category e , the classical filled blister flow with the ionized gas flowing away from the ionization front .",
    "even more remarkably , in spite of the frequency of bow - shock morphologies , none of the observed sources clearly fits into category c , a bow shock moving with a star through a molecular cloud .",
    "because they are nearly edge - on , mon r2 , g30.54 , and w3a could fit into either category c or category d. the other sources with cometary kinematic signatures all have p - v patterns characteristic of sources tipped away from the observer ( @xmath64 ) with their velocity centroids blueshifted relative to the neighboring molecular material , the signature of a pressure - driven surface flow .",
    "the preponderance of sources with their tails tipped toward the observer ( @xmath65 ) probably results from a combination of extinction and selection effects .",
    "the extinction at 12.8  @xmath0 m is relatively low ( a@xmath66/a@xmath67@xmath40.05 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the column density through the kind of massive core that harbors massive young stars and uchii regions can be substantial ( a@xmath67 @xmath68 a few hundred , * ? ? ?",
    "the density in such cores drops rather steeply , with power - law exponents of 1.6 - 1.8 @xcite .",
    "if uchii regions are not in the centers of cores , they should therefore be visible in [ ne  ii ] when the exciting stars lie between the front side and @xmath69 .",
    "our survey was somewhat biased in favor of sources lying on the front sides of molecular clouds by including sources known from optical and near - infrared observations ( ngc 7538 , w3 , and mon r2 ) .",
    "in addition , we were forced to abandon efforts to observe several uchii regions ( g8.67 - 0.36 , g10.10 + 0.74 , g10.62 - 0.38 , g12.208 - 0.10 , g33.50 + 0.20 , g42.42 - 0.27 , g45.47 + 0.05 , g50.23 + 0.33 ) because they were undetectable or too faint to map .",
    "these selection effects are likely to explain the lack of sources with kinematics indicating that they lie on the back sides of their clouds .",
    "more than half of the observed sources fit into category d , a flow along the surface of a paraboloidal shell , which accelerates relative to molecular cloud as it moves away from the apex of the paraboloid .",
    "although we have not made a hydrodynamic model of such a flow , we know of no driving mechanism for the acceleration other than the pressure gradient in the ionized gas .",
    "@xcite found that the pressure gradient acceleration would be small if the ionized and swept - up molecular gas were coupled so both had to be accelerated .",
    "but we have estimated the acceleration if the ionized gas is allowed to slip past the molecular shell , and we find that speeds @xmath420 - 30  km  s@xmath1 can occur .",
    "the hydrodynamic models of @xcite include the essential effects present in the combination of blister and bow shock models : density gradients in the neutral medium , stellar winds , and stellar motion .",
    "the @xcite models do an excellent job of matching the range of source morphologies and reproduce the most significant kinematic signatures using reasonable values for density gradients , mass loss rates , and stellar velocities .",
    "one critical area where they fall short is in explaining the width of the lines at the source vertex .",
    "the observed effect is most evident in w3a ( figure  [ w3apv ] ) and in mon  r2 @xcite where the symmetry axes are near the plane of the sky .",
    "the splitting of the broad line into two narrow lines at the velocity extremes of the broad line as one crosses the shell to the inside implies that the gas accelerates to @xmath7010  km  s@xmath1 within a small solid angle ( less than a steradian , as seen from the point of view of the ionizing star ) at the vertex .",
    "this , in turn , implies a significant pressure gradient .",
    "the [ ne  ii ] kinematics of our sample unite a large and diverse group of uchii and compact hii regions into a single empirical picture : the hii regions coexist with dense and massive molecular cores @xcite .",
    "the ionized regions have the form of partial , roughly parabolic shells with their open sides usually pointing away from the centers of the dense neutral condensations and gas flows tangentially along these shells .",
    "the evidence that very many uchii regions are dense shells with tangential flows away from the parent molecular cores has implications for the survivability of the molecular cores .",
    "earlier examinations of the erosion of dense cores by external o stars did not take the compression of neutral material by stellar wind shocks into account .",
    "these efforts led to estimates that when as little as 4% of the core material formed into stars with a salpeter imf , these stars could erode the remaining core entirely away @xcite .",
    "it has already been pointed out , however that the dense shells formed by stellar wind pressure would greatly inhibit the process of erosion @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that most if not all ob stars breaking out of dense cores form such dense shells at their boundaries .",
